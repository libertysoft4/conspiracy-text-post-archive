    <div class="md"><p>The list of names has got fuck all to do with Alex Jones. Maybe you could address the content and not shoot the messenger. No wonder people are so sensitive when the same incredibly stupid arguments get put forward so often. </p>

<p>&quot;AJ&#39;s a retard&quot; doesn&#39;t detract from any of the information or what potential discussions these people have. And to everyone who sees nothing wrong and points out that there is no proof of any type of conspiratorial discussions happening at these meetings, consider this. Pick nearly any of these people from the list (especially someone like Kissinger/Perle/Alexander etc) and tell me why you think they will be talking about nice fluffy things? It makes perfectly logical sense that when two or more pieces of shit get together with track records of being so and discuss things, it&#39;s likely they aren&#39;t talking about democracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he turned around 2006. Just too much of what he says isn&#39;t based in fact. Certainly, he was spot on several times, but I listened to his radio show too many times hearing him trying to predict the next 9/11 with no results at all. He&#39;s a sensationalist. I&#39;m thankful that he opened the veil for me, but I think today, he&#39;s pulling a whole new veil in front of the people that trust him. Who&#39;s to say that he himself isn&#39;t an agent to soften us up either? And reporting geopolitical corruption isn&#39;t exactly difficult; in the world today, it&#39;s harder to find a story about a sincere politician that isn&#39;t shoveling money in his pockets under the table. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only started listening to him recently and he certainly does a lot of prophetizing, sometimes his over reaction is laughable but the base of his arguments is unfortunately true. </p>

<p>So is he priming us for the new world order? Coming out of the fake right vs left paradox only two to three months ago and finding Alex only this May of 2014, he&#39;s still very insulated from the mainstream public as a racist Libertarian gun loving nutjob, not a lot of mainstreamers are into the &quot;conspiracies&quot; of the truth movement, however there&#39;s a lot of potential as people are becoming increasing resentful and intrusting of the governing establishment. </p>

<p>I&#39;m personally finding a lot of new stuff from Alex&#39;s perspective, however after seeing this aptly named &quot;Snowjob&quot;, I too would prefer to keep a multitude of sources then to stick to a messiah of sorts, as the sheep are doing with sold out Greenwald and Chomsky. </p>

<p>It&#39;s certainly not a bad thing to be skeptical, I can understand your criticisms of Alex Jones. </p>

Plus go and talk to some old people about the way people used to be and you will find out that most people didn&#39;t care about human life at all and seen the world end a very different way.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen a lot of evidence that points toward ties between Infowars and Ted Turner. Yes, Jones puts out some good information I will not deny that, but any legitimate controlled opposition outlet HAS to deliver some goods to the viewers; otherwise they will lose the audience. I was a big Alex Jones fan for years, but his work on the Turner owned (and total BS show IMO) truTv&#39;s &quot;Jesse Ventura&#39;s Conspiracy Theory&quot; along with his appearance in 2 motion pictures make me apprehensive.</p>

<p>Turner&#39;s business partner the now deceased Boris Berezovsky was involved in starting up anti-government media outlets in Russia in the 90&#39;s, some of these actually inspired armed insurrections resulting in deaths. Sometimes Jones likes to encourage people here in the US to maybe do something similar.</p>

<p>I noticed a fairly strange name in that list - Kasim Reed is the mayor of Atlanta, GA. Why in the world is he in attendance for this? If you live in/around Atlanta you are probably aware that there is quite a buzz in the air with new things being built basically everywhere constantly (two new sports stadiums coming up by 2017). Seeing his name here makes me really contemplate what the future plans for Atlanta could be. Thoughts? </p>

<p>I have absolutely no clue what they are discussing.  That is why I asked.  Do you know? I am sure it would be very interesting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These are the people deciding what life will be like for millions (billions?) of the rest of us. </p>

<p>Evidence of this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many are &quot;elected&quot; officials and they come from countries all over the world. </p>

<p>So? While fishy, it is not illegal.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You don&#39;t see a problem with them meeting in secret and not disclosing any details about what was discussed/planned there?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When a detailed list is released that tells us who is going and where its going to be then I wouldn&#39;t really consider these meetings secret.  Private as fuck?  Yes. But I wouldn&#39;t call them a secret. But yeah, I do kinda wish I knew what they talked about and that is why I asked if there was evidence demonstrating that we should actually care about these meetings. </p>

<p>Type some of those names in Google dude, my dude.  This is very simple stuff.  You can start with <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/allen_b2.html">Henry Kissinger</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I wouldn&#39;t call them a secret.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does the public have any idea what goes on in the meetings?  Nope.  If asked, will any Bilderbergers answer questions about what goes on in the meetings?  Nope.</p>

<p>Seems pretty secret to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that is why I asked if there was evidence demonstrating that we should actually care about these meetings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll ask you again to look at the list of names and do some research on who these people are and the things they&#39;ve done over the last 50+ years.  These are globalists and powerful people in all industries and from all around the world.  If you don&#39;t see why we should care about these meetings and what goes on in them then I really don&#39;t know what else to tell you.</p>

<p>It should be self explanatory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright I swear to Moloch im not shilling here, but I had a professor in college who went to bilderberg a couple years back.  We asked her about it during lecture one day and she said its basically a time for leaders to talk shop without the media getting all up in their faces.  She said the reason for the secrecy is to encourage frank discussions.  </p>

<p>She was a researcher on neuroethics and went with the goal of getting other leaders to think more realistically about so called &quot;study drugs&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These conferences and think tanks work the same way as secret societies and religions. There is a hierarchy and as you advance, you gain additional knowledge.  Bilderberg and bohemian grove (which you are referencing with your moloch joke) are both organized in this fashion.  There are many discussion groups and speakers are invited to take part in the outer circle discussions to provide insights on their specialties.  In this years conference, there are two chinese banking ministers invited.  They clearly aren&#39;t going to be privy to the real occidentalist discussions that the meeting is based around.  </p>
