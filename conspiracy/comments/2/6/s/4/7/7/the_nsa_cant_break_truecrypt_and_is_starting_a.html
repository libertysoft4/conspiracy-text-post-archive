<p>&quot;A warrant canary is a method by which a communications service provider informs its users that the provider has not been served with a secret United States government subpoena. Secret subpoenas, including those covered under 18 U.S.C. §2709(c) of the USA Patriot Act, provide criminal penalties for disclosing the existence of the warrant to any third party, including the service provider&#39;s users. A warrant canary may be posted by the provider to inform users of dates that they have not been served a secret subpoena. If the canary has not been updated in the time period specified by the host, users are to assume that the host has been served with such a subpoena. The intention is to allow the provider to inform users of the existence of a subpoena passively without disclosing to others that the government has sought or obtained access to information or records under a secret subpoena.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, it could be a proxy thing, e.g. - developer&#39;s ISP or other vendor was served an NSL, activating <em>their</em> canary, and activity autonomically proceeded from there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, they have hardware backdoors in everything.  They are just trying to revive interest in crypto, so that people with interesting materials will use  encryption, thereby standing out from the masses.  The problem is not  encryption (unless it&#39;s professionally done) it&#39;s finding interesting content.  Generally available  encryption tools work in principle as advertised but they serve to tag content as interesting and then the NSA goes TAO on your ass to retrieve the keys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, don&#39;t forget that the goal is not to catch <em>everyone</em> but to get the widest coverage possible.</p>

<p>Now, what kind of proxy?</p>

<ul>
<li>If it&#39;s Tor, you&#39;re flagged.  If the Tor executables aren&#39;t trojaned on the fly, they&#39;ll just flag you for later access.</li>
<li>If it&#39;s a regular proxy... bear in mind that it&#39;s safe to assume that all traffic data of all nodes is monitored.  And by monitored I mean <em>at least</em> the packet headers are recorded, high-resolution timestamps and all. It&#39;s trivial to correlate the incoming traffic to the outgoing traffic using timestamps.</li>
<li>Chaining proxies?  No biggie.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let&#39;s say you downloaded TrueCrypt from a public library using a fake ID and managed to install it undetected on your PC.  Well do you ever connect your PC to the Internet?  Bam, Microsoft updates.  How do you know Windows doesn&#39;t send a list of installed programs for &quot;anti-piracy&quot;/&quot;anti-virus&quot; purposes?</p>

<p>Unless you have an air-gapped PC in a TEMPEST-proof room with an interlock door... forget it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your second point, the NSA would have to access the server hosting the proxy, relate it to the IP that&#39;s using it, which may be hundreds if not thousands, and trace that whole route to see who downloaded it for a physical location. Many companies would be subpoenaed for all this information. More trouble than it&#39;s worth, completely unrealistic and would crunch way too much data on too many people. This would all have to be collected, cross-referenced, and analyzed for consistency and the margin for error is huge.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Total biggie. Like I described above, all that just for a TrueCrypt user? Not likely and untraceable if done right. If I&#39;m wrong, tell me how they would trace me if I use 2 proxies from foreign jurisdictions using Linux.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They can be turned off. Any person with half-decent skills knows how to block the Windows Update IP using a hosts file or simple third-party firewall. TrueCrypt is also available for Linux. What now? NSA stumped again.</p>

<p>Not the server, just it&#39;s incoming/outgoing traffic.  The proxy may be serving a lot of users but using traffic analysis it is possible to weed out the ones downloading crypto software.</p>

<p>Especially since they can taint the packet stream by modulating the response time of the server from which the TrueCrypt files are originating.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to subpoena any more companies; just assume that they can observe traffic in and out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I&#39;m wrong, tell me how they would trace me if I use 2 proxies from foreign jurisdictions using Linux.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter.  They can observe both endpoints and use time correlation: TrueCrypt download server and individual user.  If there is too much noise they can modulate packet delays at either end.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any person with half-decent skills knows how to block the Windows Update IP using a hosts file or simple third-party firewall. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>By blocking updates you do two things.</p>

<p>(a) You&#39;re now a Windows machine with blocked updates; only a minority of users would block updates.  You&#39;ve tainted yourself.</p>

<p>(b) You&#39;re making yourself vulnerable to attack vectors.</p>

<p>And any way, updates are one covert way of exfiltrating data; Windows is closed source.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s say you use Linux.  Just use dm-crypt then; no point in using TrueCrypt.  In any case as a Linux user you are in the minority and thus more interesting.  There must be some piece of general spyware that targets Linux users.  Lots of Linux users use closed-source code; anything from Google for example.  Or Flash plugins.  Or maybe you want some obscure codec to watch a movie.  Or you need to install Acrobat Reader to fill some government form.</p>

<p>All these are venues through which someone who controls the pipes (in the sense that they can modify traffic on-the-fly) and can get suitable signing keys using TAOs could access your computer.</p>

<ul>

<p>IIRC on Linux, TrueCrypt uses the same dm-crypt for doing the actual encryption.  So it&#39;s more of a key/volume management tool.  LUKS comes standard with Linux distros and you can select the ciphers you want.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pure gold. Admission you say shit without proof. Don&#39;t worry, I already know this.</p>

<p>Security researchers work based on threat models that are generally way more paranoid than that, without proof.  That&#39;s because spying is by nature secretive and you rarely find proof.  I&#39;m only appealing to standard models of traffic analysis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then bore me. Indulge me, if you will, that is if you want me to take you seriously.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read the papers I linked to.  You will see some techniques that can be used to deanonymize proxied traffic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 proxies each in a different country using Linux with all ports blocked except 80, 443, and 21</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See steps 1 to 7.  Your operating system or blocked ports are irrelevant.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a simple scenario.</p>

<p>Assume you happen to download TrueCrypt during a very quiet time, say 03:21:11.52 AM for the server hosting the TrueCrypt binaries.  Then there is outgoing TCP stream of a specific size, say 54,321,000 bytes that matches the size of the TrueCrypt binary on the server starting at 03:21:11.53 and ending at 03:35.42.75.  There is an incoming TCP stream of the same size on your machine starting at at 03:21:11.52 and ending at 03:35:42.77.  No one else downloaded anything from the TrueCrypt server.</p>

<p>Now NSA can select from their database of traffic TCP connections that ran from 03:21:11±1 to 03:35:42±1 that day  and sucked 54,321,000±some overhead.  This will give you, I don&#39;t know, maybe a thousand hits... it all depends on traffic.</p>

<p>They can filter that down to hosts that are known to use a proxy server.  Let&#39;s say they can drill that down to 50 IPs.</p>

<p>OK so fast-forward three moths you download another update of TrueCrypt.  They get another short list of 50 IPs.  Except that they&#39;re likely unrelated, so you square root that and you&#39;re down to ~7-8 IPs (worst case.)</p>

<p>That&#39;s why anonymizing remailers like mixmaster add large, random delays before forwarding e-mail.  To prevent this kind of attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You have NO fucking idea what you&#39;re saying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh yes I do.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is this: it&#39;s not by attacking the crypto primitives by brute force that NSA defeats encryption as used by the general public.</p>

<p>The hardware and software we are all using is extremely complex and is full of loopholes (software and hardware bugs) if not intentional backdoors.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how the NSA and consorts can get crypto material if they think you&#39;re interesting.  They just hack into your PC.  That&#39;s their jobs.</p>

<p>You need to assume that the NSA is in control of the internet pipes.  Not only can they observe traffic, they can also alter it.  For example, let&#39;s say you download some executable from the Internet.  If you download an EXE over HTTP they can target that and modify it, possibly on the fly; bam they have control of your computer.</p>

<p>It&#39;s over HTTPS?  Well they hack into the server first, get the signing keys, and then do the live modification.</p>

<p>The packages are themselves signed (say Debian packages)?  Same deal.</p>

<p>They can install a nice root kit into your BIOS; they can update your CPU&#39;s opcodes; and all those things don&#39;t even assume they have hardware backdoors.</p>

<p>They probably don&#39;t use the hardware backdoors they most certainly have in many major CPUs/network controller chips/GPUs/bridge chips etc. except for high-profile targets (say against Iranian centrifuges or whatever.)</p>

They&#39;re still only getting your encrypted data, which they must decrypt for it to be of any use.

<p>fexfexfex just doesn&#39;t want to understand what I&#39;m saying.  I don&#39;t know why.</p>

<p>To have your system compromised by a TLA  three things are needed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Interest — the TLA must be interested in you.  Note that this can be automated.</li>
<li>Vulnerability — Your system needs to have a vulnerability or backdoor known to the TLA.</li>
<li>Contact — Your systems needs to communicate with systems controlled by the TLA.</li>
</ul>

<p>EXPLOITATION = INTEREST + VULNERABILITY + CONTACT</p>

<h1>Interest</h1>

<p>With the vast resources now available to the TLAs, the bar for getting some special attention has been lowered significantly.  We don&#39;t know what their criteria are.
Browsing some websites or showing interest in some topics might be enough.<br/>
You may then simply be put on a low-priority list of targets.</p>

<h1>Backdoors &amp; vulnerabilities</h1>

<p>I personally assume that hardware and software is compromised, from computers to routers.  For me, backdoors are in.</p>

<p>Thus if the NSA target you specifically, they will get in, period — unless you&#39;re Bruce Schneier and you work on a laptop from a TEMPEST shielded room with an interlock; or possibly if you work in a non-NATO country in the countryside on a laptop from which you removed all non-essential chips esp. Bluetooth and WiFi.
But for that you need to be a careful high value target.</p>

<h1>Non-backdoor vulnerabilities</h1>

<p>Now let&#39;s say you don&#39;t want to accept that they have backdoors.  Fine.</p>

<p>The software we use is full of security holes and has been so for decades, and it will keep being that way for the foreseable future.  There are non-conspiratorial reasons for this but let&#39;s not digress.</p>

<p>It&#39;s getting better but one vulnerability is all it takes.  A vulnerability is equivalent to an unintentional backdoor.  And the NSA/GCHQ/whoever guys certainly can find them.  They have the expertise and tools.</p>

<p>Thus: Unless you built it yourself from scratch (and by that I mean in way that involves soldering irons and PCB manufacturing), your system <strong>has</strong> vulnerabilities known to the TLAs.</p>

<h1>Contact</h1>

<p>Since you&#39;re not Bruce Schneier or an elite hax0r, you&#39;re going to use the Internet; you&#39;re going to update software, browse the web, download movies, open PDFs or otherwise communicate.</p>

<p>Unless you only use your laptop to write your revolutionary manifesto, you&#39;re going to do a million things that provide contact opportunities.</p>

<p>Contact with TLA systems can happen by the use of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Major ISPs</li>
<li>Websites</li>
<li>Advertising networks — thus most websites</li>
<li>Software distribution channels</li>
</ul>

<p>We know TLAs have compromised ISPs for spying, so we can also assume that they are using them for injecting spyware.  Thus the cooperation of most websites, etc. is not needed.</p>

<h2>Scenario 1</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s say your computer is marked for access.  Here is a simple way in which TLAs may gain access to your computer.  It doesn&#39;t even require backdoors in your computer or vulnerabilities.</p>

<ul>
<li>TLAs gain access to your DSL or cable modem and configure it for payload insertion</li>
<li>The next time you download a piece of software from Sourceforge your modem modifies the .zip (or whatever) on the fly inserting a small trojan</li>
<li>You install that and bam, you&#39;re done.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the above you can replace modem with any piece of equipment between you and the machine that serves the executable.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t forget, TLAs are also LEAs and thus they could simply tell your ISP to start routing their packets through their machines.</p>

<h2>Scenario 2</h2>

<p>In this scenario your web browser has a vulnerability known to the TLA.  You visit some random website that serves ads from a network that is used by TLAs to deliver payloads.</p>

<ul>
<li>The ad contains a piece of obfuscated Javascript that queries some TLA-controlled server;</li>
<li>The TLA-controlled server looks your computer&#39;s fingerprint (OS + browser version + IP + etc.) in a database and it turns out you&#39;re marked for insertion; it then serves a piece of Javascript or whatever that contains a 0-day exploit and they&#39;re in.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>Explain what?</p>

<p>If a TLA manages to get a piece of spyware on a target computer, said piece of spyware can steal encryption keys, or cipher text, or inspect encrypted volumes the next time they are accessed and upload a summary of interesting bits.  And
If they bust you later they will be able to decrypt your drive.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>In the case of disk  encryption, the keys are not available if the TrueCrypt volume is not mounted.  The Trojan can wait for the user to enter the  passphrase and snatch the passphrase.  Or it can examine memory to locate active key schedules or keys themselves.</p>

<p>The key can then be sent to the TLA or attached somewhere. Later, if the hard drive is seized it can be decrypted.</p>

<p>Having access to the vault doesn&#39;t mean that you can smuggle out or examine all of its contents undetected.  Making a copy of the key to the vault is useful.</p>

<p>In the case of off-line messaging, e.g. gpg/pgp usage, the private key would be snatched allowing decryption of all intercepted messages.</p>

<p>All these things being very elementary, I&#39;m wondering if you&#39;re trolling.</p>
