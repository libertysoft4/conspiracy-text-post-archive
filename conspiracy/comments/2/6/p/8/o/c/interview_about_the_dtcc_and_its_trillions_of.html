        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zzSAoD2mzU">Here&#39;s a link to the interview</a>.  It was supposed to appear on 5/17 on the History Channel&#39;s <em>America&#39;s Book of Secrets</em> in an episode entitled &quot;Secret Underground&quot;.  The person being interviewed is/was Bix Weir, the creator of <a href="http://www.roadtoroota.com/public/main.cfm">this site</a> (which is great in my opinion), and he was apparently given no word or reason as to why the interview wasn&#39;t aired.</p>

<p>Here are some of the topics covered in the interview which were <a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message2558389/pg1">taken from this GLP thread which has links to a lot of other information on this</a> (credit to the OP):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What is the DTCC and why is it so secretive and important?</p></li>
<li><p>How can the DTCC process and clear the billions of High Frequency Trades that happen in milliseconds every day?</p></li>
<li><p>Why are there over 300 Million stock trades that occur every day that are never processed or delivered?</p></li>
<li><p>How many phony and duplicate stock certificates of mining companies are there at the DTCC?</p></li>
<li><p>What happened to the $36T worth of paper securities that were submerged underwater during Hurricane Sandy?</p></li>
<li><p>Why were all the gold and silver swap contracts transferred to the vault at 55 Water Street just weeks before it was flooded?</p></li>
<li><p>How did a huge fire erupt in the DTCC vault basement just after all the water was pumped out?</p></li>
<li><p>Why was ex-CFTC Commissioner Michael Dunn (who argued against Dodd-Frank Swap Regulations) put in charge of the DTCC Vault just months before it flooded?</p></li>
<li><p>Why does the DTCC hold legal title to all stocks, corporate and muni bonds, physical bearer bonds and even derivative contracts under the nominee name &quot;CEDE &amp; Company&quot;?</p></li>
<li><p>If the government, Federal Reserve, exchanges and banks don&#39;t own the DTCC...who does?</p></li>
<li><p>Why does the DTCC hold legal title to 99% of all mortgages in the world? (even yours!)</p></li>
<li><p>What are the ramifications of the DTCC (and their bankruptcy remote entity &quot;CEDE &amp; Company&quot;) owning legal title to 99% of all financial instruments in the world?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Mind blowing interview.  Makes one wonder why not a single word of it was allowed to air...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hadn&#39;t realized what a big deal it actually is until recently either.  My attention had been mainly focused on the derivatives markets but now I see that the DTCC and &quot;Cede &amp; Co.&quot; are also <em>huge</em> pieces of the big picture, far moreso than I initially thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While the information regarding the DTCC is extremely interesting, Bix Weir is a poor prognosticator at best, and something more sinister at worst. He is on record saying Obama is one of the &quot;good guys&quot;. He has said the same thing regarding Alan Greenspan. He has a ridiculous narrative he sticks to called &quot;the road to roota theory&quot; where he says that we are going to go back to a gold standard and that we can just sit back because there are covert operations at the very top to get the cartel out of power, but never shows proof. </p>

<p>Please, read more about the flooding at the DTCC during Sandy, it is absolutely fascinating, but please, stay away from Bix Weir.</p>

<p>Edit: Actually, for people that have never heard of the DTCC flood, there is a good synopsis with the crucial information you need to know starting at around 12:00. However I still believe Bix is scam artist who wants you to subscribe to his speculation newsletter.  The interviewer, SGTreport is great though and you guys should sub to him on YouTube.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just came across him and his website today so I&#39;ll have to investigate further.  I do agree with you, though, that the &quot;road to roota theory&quot; seems very much like a pipe dream to me on its face.  Even if he does have ulterior motives, though, I found the interview incredibly interesting and most of what he said in it regarding the DTCC I&#39;ve since corroborated with other sources.</p>

<p>Perhaps he&#39;s of the ol&#39; 90% truth, 10% bullshit camp of disinfo.</p>
