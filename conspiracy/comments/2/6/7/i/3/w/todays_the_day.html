<p>I think we do not have sufficient evidence to claim he is or is not one, yet.</p>

<p>Again all your points make sense. Though, what if their intent is to leak this information increasingly to build up to the devastating stuff that could change governments?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have and am still unconvinced. In my opinion there is no solid evidence he is either a limited hangout or not.</p>

<p>Every point pointing to limited hangout can also be perceived to as a legitimate building up of company like Wikileaks to bring forth leaks from governments that people need to hear about. If he was just running a blog, no one would take him seriously. He is setting up a professional  medium through which to pass this information he has onto others.</p>

<p>I think that if he is genuine, then he is doing the best he can with what he has. Am I frustrated he hasn&#39;t dumped all the info to the web and let us sort through it? Yes. Though, I am aware that such a tactic is needed to remain in the medias spotlight as well substantiate his legitimacy.</p>

<p>If they just threw a ton of documents at us, can we prove they were doctored or not? No, but if they write a well written article to go along with the documents the information can be displayed in an effective manner.</p>

<p>The public is sick and tired of the story.</p>

<p>Greenwald is making bank at a place with highly questionable financial support that seems to say one thing yet do another.</p>

<p>Regardless of what can be proven about greenwalds inner motivations, this whole thing has had the net effect on society of a well planned limited hangout. If it quacks like a duck, forgive me for calling it a duck.</p>

Causing doubt and infighting would be a great way.  That being said I think it is likely wiki leaks or the Snowden side have been infiltrated.  If this revelation ever comes out and it indeed does cause deaths or some kind of major shakeup... I would be pretty sure wiki leaks was either coopted from the beginning or is a limited hangout.

    <div class="md"><p>That is what I thought too, a lot of online articles confused me about the unmentioned country versus how the Bahamas are completely locked down, and they know everything going in and out of that country.</p>

<p>I think there is a concerted effort to make readers think that nameless country is the Bahamas and just to dismiss it. Though, those of us on top of the fucking story know Greenwald claims people may die from the country&#39;s name being released, whereas when Bahamas was released as a country  being 100% infiltrated, heads didn&#39;t roll that much.</p>

<p>edit: or its due to poor journalism which mainstream has slipped into.</p>

The NSA and partners have the entire western world cached and this dribbling of OMG country X or country Y is a decade old piece of distractive pap IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is what I thought too, a lot of online articles confused me about the unmentioned country versus how the Bahamas are completely locked down, and they know everything going in and out of that country.</p>

<p>I think there is a concerted effort to make readers think that nameless country is the Bahamas and just to dismiss it. Though, those of us on top of the fucking story know Greenwald claims people may die from the country&#39;s name being released, whereas when Bahamas was released as a country  being 100% infiltrated, heads didn&#39;t roll that much.</p>

<p>edit: or its due to poor journalism which mainstream has slipped into.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have and am still unconvinced. In my opinion there is no solid evidence he is either a limited hangout or not.</p>

<p>Every point pointing to limited hangout can also be perceived to as a legitimate building up of company like Wikileaks to bring forth leaks from governments that people need to hear about. If he was just running a blog, no one would take him seriously. He is setting up a professional  medium through which to pass this information he has onto others.</p>

<p>I think that if he is genuine, then he is doing the best he can with what he has. Am I frustrated he hasn&#39;t dumped all the info to the web and let us sort through it? Yes. Though, I am aware that such a tactic is needed to remain in the medias spotlight as well substantiate his legitimacy.</p>

<p>If they just threw a ton of documents at us, can we prove they were doctored or not? No, but if they write a well written article to go along with the documents the information can be displayed in an effective manner.</p>
