    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit you are so right!!! As a personal example, I just today read a r/worldnews post about people marching on Monsanto. I was thinking to myself before I clicked on the comments that it would be a great discussion cheering on the spirit of protest and fighting back against a criminal corporation...yet, to my disbelief, the top comment in the thread was someone saying how dumb people are for spouting &quot;myths&quot; about Monsanto and (paraphrase) how &quot;oh these are probably those same misinformed people who say GMOs are bad&quot; and being really aversive towards the animal studies regarding GMOs. The insanity ensued as I read almost all the replies to the top comments agreeing with this sentiment and really trying to label people who question Monsanto&#39;s unethical and downright evil practices as people who are just ignorant sheep (which is ironic in and of itself)!!</p>

<p>Whoever was responsible for those comments took what was an activist event and turned it into a complete &quot;make everyone who questions status quo look like idiots&quot; thread. That is clear disinformation and is the exact protocol we saw from the NSA slides to use online forums to actively turn public opinion against any sort of incendiary ideas. And, of course, it&#39;s front page.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure &quot;RIP Reddit&quot; at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Just... no. Holy crap <em>no</em>. I can&#39;t even explain how incredibly dangerous and wrong that is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you define the &quot;far more good?&quot; Because the harm is dead children. Me being a little less sad after a death is good, but is it worth the mass murder of little kids? (And I&#39;m not just talking Sandy Hook - every single day, check the local news - there&#39;s a murder suicide every single day in my state.) Which just sucks. </p>

<p>I am actually not against full-scale banning of medications with deadly side effects, but there are a slew of things that could be done to make them safer and reduce the number of spree stabbings/shootings/murder-suicides caused by withdrawal/toxicity.</p>

<p>So, for one thing, there&#39;s some research identifying a specific gene which predisposes some people to not properly metabolizing their medication, resulting in a much higher level of homicidal behavior than others who do not have the gene: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3513220/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3513220/</a></p>

<p>Why not test for that gene before prescribing, then fast-track that person into good therapy and a medication that DOESN&#39;T have homicidal ideation as a side effect?</p>

<p>Why not, after putting a patient on a medication, pull &#39;em back in a week later and do a blood test to verify that they&#39;re metabolizing their meds correctly?</p>

<p>Why not educate patients up and down and around the bend that if they&#39;re on a type of medication that has suicidal or homicidal ideation as a side effect (not just SSRIS, btw, you have Lyrica and a number of anti-seizure meds and what the heck - even Tamiflu with psychiatric side effects!), do NOT drink if it&#39;s liver-metabolized, do NOT drink grapefruit juice if it&#39;s kidney metabolized?</p>

<p>Why not provide people with tools to taper off their medication when they are ready (no one wants to take Chantix forever), instead of being put into situations where people go cold turkey (very dangerous for many) or are forced to break up their pills (which can be really dangerous, too, especially if they&#39;re using slow-release capsules)?</p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t we pushing for public programs that pay for people to get their medications when they run out so that they don&#39;t go into full blown withdrawal? (How many people, when experiencing an adverse reaction to a medication, just get pushed out by their doctors and are left to fend alone? I would hope not many, but it happened to me once--not a psych medication, but the side effect was one that lawsuits are still going on about, so it&#39;s not inconceivable that others are in the same boat.)</p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t we rethinking putting patients on cocktails of 10-12 medications that have never really been tested together? You hear people say, &quot;Show me the study, show me the research!&quot; yet no one ever says, &quot;Show me the study that these 6 drugs together will help a PTS patient&quot; - patients just get the medications dispensed and pushed out of the office. And when they have a side effect, they&#39;re told it&#39;s psychosomatic, here, you just need to up your dosage and all will be well. And then, when they get seratonin syndrome and kill themselves, the response is, &quot;Well, what do you expect, they were mentally ill!&quot; That&#39;s not science, that&#39;s quackery. </p>

<p>These medications could be made safer. The suicides and murders could be lessened, if not fully eradicated. But instead, we sit on our hands and hush up any warnings and any education about how to make these medications safer, and I just watch suicide after suicide after suicide. And lawyers broker settlement after settlement on the down-low. And the cycle continues. It sucks.</p>

<p>Hardly, it&#39;s all over the media. Did you not read his manifesto and watch his video?</p>

<p>Feminists on tumblr and other websites are already jumping on it and using it to justify their ideologies and agendas.  </p>

<p>Even if you&#39;re not aware of the deeper conspiracy theories surrounding the topic (e.g feminism being used to weaken/divide the west, or the conspiracies surrounding the modern Feminist movement and how it was funded and orchestrated by big business and the elite to &quot;empower&quot; (Mobilize) women into the workforce), it makes sense from a political point of view. </p>

<p>They did the same for Obama - Made it out that anyone who didn&#39;t like him was a racist. Race related attacks were over reported on by mainstream media just before both of Obama&#39;s campaign victories. It was subconsciously implied that by voting for Obama you were somehow combating racism.</p>

<p>They&#39;re doing the same for Hillary in the 2016 election, except by making anyone who doesn&#39;t like her seem like a women hater/Misogynist. </p>

<p>It&#39;s literally the most tried-and-true, most effective tactic the elite have. Make an opinion or ideology they want to destroy unpopular by associating it with a lunatic, idiot, or actor pretending to be one. </p>

<p>A great example can be seen here </p>

<p><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2013/stephanie-banister-compared-with-sarah-palin-as-gafferidden-interview-makes-headlines-around-the-world-20130809-2rlx4.html">http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2013/stephanie-banister-compared-with-sarah-palin-as-gafferidden-interview-makes-headlines-around-the-world-20130809-2rlx4.html</a></p>

<p>This woman&#39;s entire &quot;political career&quot; was basically this interview. The entire purpose of which was to make anti-immigration, pro white groups look stupid by association. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong - I&#39;m not a white supremacist or extremist. It just seems pretty obvious to me how the status quo is maintained in a world filled with competing ideas and beliefs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>believe me, i have watched the whole thing. i&#39;ve actually been talking about it with my ex girlfriend for the last 4 hours. she grew up in calabassas, and somehow has 2 mutual friends with the guy on facebook. i&#39;ve seen a lot of the coverage on the internet, but i don&#39;t watch much tv. anyway, my point was that i don&#39;t see how the government could use this to push any agendas aside from gun control and mass surveillance. even if someone tried to assert that the incident means all men should be taught about feminism, (or whatever you want to call it) i don&#39;t see how this benefits the rich, the government, etc. i don&#39;t see where the motive is. the only motive i can think of is the idea that it creates a polarized environment with respect to gender. perhaps they could use this to help hillary in her election, as you suggested? it&#39;s entirely possible. i just don&#39;t see it as nearly as significant as the issues of gun control or surveillance.</p>

<p>and keep in mind that this is one of sooo many mass shootings over the last 5 years. this is the first time (to my knowledge) that the media has even mentioned the gender issue. what they all have in common is that the media has used them to push gun control and, to a lesser extent, surveillance and other violations of our rights. do you see what i mean? there seems to be, at the very least, a media conspiracy to USE these shootings as, ironically, ammunition in the war against guns. the sheer amount of media coverage on all of these shootings suggests that <em>gun control</em> is the subject of this media conspiracy. which is why it seems like the gender issue is just a <em>detail</em> in <em>one</em> of the incidents, rather than a subject of a conspiracy. if all of the shooters in the mass murders of the last 5 years were misogynists, then i would absolutely not call it a footnote. but it seems like this is just a small detail in one incident. that doesn&#39;t stop the neoliberal feminists from using it for their political agenda, but i think the bigwigs are primarily using this to push the gun control thing.</p>

<p>hope i made myself more clear this time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By being divided into camps fighting amongst ourselves over who&#39;s issue is the most important, we lose track of the fact that nothing is getting done about any of those equally important issues as attention to each group remains minimal. We saw this with occupy.</p>

<p>The greater conspiracy theory at play is an old one with ties and roots in every facet of our lives. It&#39;s impossible to link everything involved into one simple entity, for it is the foundation of our society and history which is the conspiracy theory, the conspiracy being the promotion of revised and biased notion of warfare and the economics behind them throughout the late 18th until even today. It alone is the sole reason truth and transparency are not capable of surviving in our political climate, and for why honesty and cooperation are not considered for industry. Because the tendrils that have infected our leadership on a global stage has done so in both private and public sectors. It has the upper hand, and if unchecked the endgame will be disastrous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah i know exactly what you mean, and i have definitely written and talked about this subject many times in the past. i owe it to george carlin for enlightening me on the matter, i guess you would say. he has a few really great bits regarding the left right paradigm, the scheme of divide and conquer. before i heard his comedy, i had never seen anything about it before in my life. everyone i knew was polarized, especially politically. i grew up staunchly liberal, extremely anti republican. i saw only red vs. blue everywhere i went. when i heard his comedy my entire world paradigm fell apart, and i realized the leaders of the neoliberals and conservatives are equally at fault. it&#39;s just a game, a puppet show they put on to a) divide us and b) make us think we have a choice. i always see political arguments on message boards, especially youtube and facebook for some reason... and i often try to bring this up so i can bring people together, but it always fails. there&#39;s always a few who agree with me, people who already understand what i&#39;m talking about. but i have completely failed at getting anyone to change their opinion... at least, to my knowledge. it feels like a lost cause, but i suppose when people stumble on this information themselves, instead of being lectured on it by someone else, it can have a profound impact on them. that&#39;s how i changed. it turned me into a mega conspiracy buff, as george carlin would say. so maybe if we release this information in an objective way, without confronting people, we stand a chance at breaking through the massive wall of propaganda. who knows?</p>
