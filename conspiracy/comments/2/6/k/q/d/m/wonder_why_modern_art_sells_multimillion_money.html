    <div class="md"><p>so fucking true. i hate how the modern art and fashion culture attracts the snobby types, the people who want to show off how edgy and evolved they are. they latch on to this completely worthless &quot;movement,&quot; learn all the programmed phrases to say when discussing modern art or fashion, and spew it out to sound intelligent. you hit the nail on the head: just a bunch of useless, privately insecure pricks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s really interesting about art culture is that sometimes there are guys like Max Ernst who latch on to a wealthy person (like Monique DeMenil) who recognises true talent.  Then they have the ability to just spend their life creating...and creating beautiful art.</p>

<p>Then there are these modern artists who latch on to old money...the kind that&#39;s second or third generation &quot;never accomplished anything except being born out of the right vagina.&quot;  With old money comes the fucking yuppies with their jargon and nonsense that prop them up.  The ones that produce shit like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9lmvX00TLY">this</a> and other things.</p>

This is what happens when people have it easy. Put them in a different time/place where there is widespread famine, war, etc. and I guarantee this emotional and dramatic bullshit disguised as art would disappear. However, it would probably reappear a few generations later when everyone forgot the turmoil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always felt most modern art was like the &#39;Emperor&#39;s New Clothes&#39;: A guy riding around naked in the street, but nobody points out he&#39;s naked because they were told that only dumb people couldn&#39;t see his clothes.

    <div class="md"><p>The story is actually that, but applied to society and rulers. We follow along because the ruler says to, while the ruler himself is just as easily misled by those who &quot;weave deception&quot;. It is pretty much the most widespread and simplified answer as to why injustice and suffering are found in a world with mostly &quot;good&quot; people just trying to fit in and not cause trouble. The child&#39;s innocence is the only thing strong enough to stand up to the social conditioning the people have let themselves be corralled into. The basis of the story applies to any group of followers, really. </p>

<p>This is my main issue with modern art. I don&#39;t consider ANYONE a true visual artist unless they can draw the human form accurately. If you can do that, I&#39;ll give you a free pass when it comes to putting Legos in your dick and talking about art theory. If you can&#39;t at least draw from life with a piece of used firewood you&#39;re just a well-groomed bullshitter, in my book. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think having knowledge of human anatomy is a prerequisite for being a visual artist, but it certainly is a symptom of being one. I encountered a lot of snobs at college, and while I was a BS student, I still taught myself how to draw. It was always funny seeing that most students couldn&#39;t draw a human that wasn&#39;t completely broken anatomy wise, since their classes were little hugboxes where nobody could make something crappy, and because of the rampant positive feedback they never strove to improve</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the scam as I know it.  All legal too.  </p>

<p>1) purchase art/crafts at cut rate from desperate private collectors<br/>
2) curate the object, provenance, description, etc..<br/>
3) ASSIGN a value to it.<br/>
4) sell it to yourself.. from the company that you hired to buy it for you.  take a commission.<br/>
5) DONATE the art at the inflated price and take a nice cut off your tax bill.. it&#39;s about 50c on the dollar, not a bad investment considering you pulled the value out of your ass.   </p>

A collector will only have a small percentage of their collection on display at any time, even at home. The majority sits in a secure, climate-controlled warehouse, similar to a bank vault.

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you so much for this article.  It&#39;s the &#39;Emperors New Clothes&#39; in action, tell people it&#39;s great art, fund universities and so called &#39;art critics&#39; to say how great it is.  Everyone swallows it and the illegal trade in absolute worthless shit can begin.  It&#39;s so obvious when you sit and think about it, but it had never occurred to me.  Even I had bought into it and wowed over Pollocks work.  Now I see it for exactly what it is, absolute worthless shit that should be destroyed along with almost everything else that has been foisted on us.  That bloke who saws cows in half, puts it in formaldehyde and sells it for a small fortune, shit.  That woman with her &#39;unmade bed&#39; shit.  All shit.</p>
