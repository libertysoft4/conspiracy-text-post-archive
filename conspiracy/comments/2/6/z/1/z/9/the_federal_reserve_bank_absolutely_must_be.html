    <div class="md"><p>Too late. It was our great grandparents&#39; job to do, and they didn&#39;t do it. It has corrupted the federal government (and most of the state governments) so completely, it isn&#39;t just a matter of getting rid of the fed anymore; it&#39;s a matter of getting rid of the United States government too. They know enough people will eventually come to realize this; and that&#39;s what they are preparing for. They don&#39;t have to neutralize the general population; only the 4 or 5% who are fighters. Most of the police state is just theatre to keep the rest in line.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it is not too late, The majority of people in the Government are good people, they are just being lied to constantly by the Zionists who hold key posiitions in government and also control all the media outlets.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve will be abolished by the will of the American People.
Currently, the American people are setting up state backed public banks in several states.</p>

<p>The American People understand it is no longer about the Republicans vs the Democrats, it is about the People of the United States vs the Federal Reserve Bank.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people are good people, but as we know, the Zionists have control only because they own the Federal Reserve Bank. Abolish it and you will see 95% of America&#39;s problems vanish. People and Congres dont know about what the Federal Reserve is doing because the Zionists lie to them and hide the truth from them. </p>

<p>Congress will awaken and the Federal Reserve will be abolished.
Further, actions are being taken at the state level to create state backed public banks so that Americans wont lose all their wealth when the Zionists decide to crash the United States Dollar.</p>

<p>There is obvioulsy no need for the Federal Reserve bank, the United States Government can do everything the Federal Reserve can do using backed money, tell everyone the truth and what actions they can take to abolish it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Unied States Dollar crash and Martial law wont be anything big as long as people gear up for it, meaning get your money out of the banks right now and into gold.</p>

<p>Have a way to get out to the countryside, and start eating bugs and hunting deer, get moutain bikes, you dont need much to survive, just warmth, water, food, and fire.</p>

<p>Get solar panels now so you can power-up ham radios, and other electronics.</p>

<p>Start printing guns using 3-d printing.</p>

<p>Right now it is best to get alternative banking by setting up state backed public banks so that you can put your money there and you will keep your wealth from getting wiped out when the Zionists decide to crash the United States Dollar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US/world is fucked. All the pieces are stacked against us. Before the next &quot;American revolution&quot;, we will have WWIII and a draft. Which will falsely &quot;unite&quot; the people, and those dissenters will be thrown into camps. Research the clause Reagan&#39;s people put into place during the cold war. Martial law, if the populous is against a war/ invasion. The pieces are falling into place. Why do you think they want every illegal immigrant to have amnesty/ citizenship. We need a lot of people to fight, a billion man army (China). We are going to war with Russia / China, idk when, but i know we are. You can feel it in the air. This will be the only thing that can bring us out of debt/ save face for the banking cartels. If we don&#39;t have a war, the system will crash, people will blame the fiat banking system and real change could happen. They don&#39;t want that, and wont let it happen. America as the founders know it is dead, the next &quot;beacon of hope&quot; in the world is to be determined. I&#39;ve lost faith in people, and try to help those whom are close and I love. &quot;The masses are ignorant&quot; - Plato, said it so beautifully simple. Gear up people, prepare mentally and physically because a &quot;brave new world&quot; is coming, it&#39;s inevitable. Scares, the absolute shit out of me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong, What will bring us out of debt is by right now, creating state backed public banks.
State backed public banks would be fine, and totally Constitutional, they would be local and the money would be backed by &quot;Authorized Gold&quot;. State backed public banks would be by nature modular, and money would be backed by a fixed amount of &quot;Authorized Gold&quot;, that would never change. It could be a mixture of gold, silver, and platinum with very specifc ratios.</p>

<p>Each State backed Dollar will represent 1 picogram of &quot;Authorized Gold&quot;. There are 1 trillion pico grams in a gram. Each state would create 3 trillion in &quot;Authorized Gold&quot;, so it would only cost the state 3 grams of gold to do this, which is only $120.69</p>

<p>One trillion of the State Notes would be distributed to the people evenly and they could do what they want with it, save it, spend it, invest. All State Notes will look the same except for the State Initials printed somewhere on it.</p>

<p>Another 1.65 trillion in &quot;Authorized Gold&quot; would be kept in each public bank so that people, even billionaires, could transfer all their savings over to a State backed public bank. Also, people could change their United States Dollar notes to State backed dollar notes if they like, it would be an even exchange, and the State backed public banks could then dispose of the United States Dollar Notes that are traded in.</p>

<p>Each state would then give 350 billion, so that together between 50 states the 17.9 trillion dollar national debt would be completely paid off.</p>

<p>The State backed public banks would give the Federal Government a percentage of the interest that the State backed public banks make.</p>

<p>Since each State backed public bank would have a substantial interest income the Federal Government would get more than enough to fund the military.</p>

<p>Social Security will also be handled at the State level through interest income.</p>

<p>By doing this, there will be 50 state backed public banks, any american can bank at any one of them, no matter what state they are from, and inerest rates would be the same for all of them. Interest rates could be changed by a vote of 90% of the states.</p>

<p>Each different State&#39;s Dollar Note would be backed by the same amount of &quot;Authorized Gold&quot; (1 picogram) as all other states and the &quot;Authorized Gold&quot; would be stored separately in each state.</p>

<p>By doing this each State will be more solidified as an entity, and since there would be 50 public state backed public banks there would be no need for the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>By doing this right now, each state will take it&#39;s power back from the scumbag Federal Reserve Zionists, and it is perfectly Constitutional:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.blacklistednews.com/Are_Public_Banks_Unconstitutional%3F_No._Are_Private_Banks%3F_Maybe./35311/0/0/0/Y/M.html">http://www.blacklistednews.com/Are_Public_Banks_Unconstitutional%3F_No._Are_Private_Banks%3F_Maybe./35311/0/0/0/Y/M.html</a></p>

<p>This would eliminate inflation, and totally stop the scumbag Federal Reserve Zionists from destroying the United States and the entire world with their plan for a New World Order, or a One World Government.</p>

<p>And it will also protect your wealth when the Scumbag Federal Reserve Zionists decide to crash the United States Dollar.</p>

<p>Again, this proves there is absolutely no need for the Federal Reserve Bank.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might want to read a little about the real Federal Reserve system and not the fantasy Federal Reserve system with all the myths and rumors that have been passed down over the years.</p>

<p>For starters, there&#39;s not <em>a</em> Federal Reserve bank, there are 12 separate banks, one for each of the 12 regions. They are managed separately and owned by all the member banks in that region, not by &quot;Zionists and foreigners.&quot;</p>

<p>One of your links says that &quot;50% of American’s tax dollars are being used to pay this interest year after year.&quot; Another says that it&#39;s 40%. The real number is: <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;amp;id=1258">&quot;about 6% of the budget.&quot;</a> Most of that goes to the <em>other</em> owners of Treasury bonds, like individuals and retirement funds, not to the Federal Reserve, who buy only a portion of Treasury bonds that are issued. And most of the interest that the Federal Reserve gets is given back to the federal government. Over the past 60 years, only 2% of the net interest on the federal debt has gone to the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>The web sites that you linked to are just repeating rumors that they have heard. They don&#39;t check the facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dont come around here with your clutter. It is full well known that the Federal Reserve is owned by scumbag Zionist Foreigners, the Rothcheilds, Rockefeller. Warburgs, Bilderburgs, and they are the only ones allowed to own stock it in, and also the Federal Reserve cannot even be audited by Congress.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve Bank of New York controls all of them, the other so-called Federal Reserve Banks are there to provide confusion.</p>

<p>The back and forth bond tranactions are also there to provide confusion. The net effect is that the Federal Reserve prints money out of thin air, gives it to the United States Government and charges interest to the taxpayer on it. The interest payments amount to %50 of American&#39;s tax dollars.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve is classified as a non-profit corporation, yet it makes profit of much more than 84 Billion a year from these interest payments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Things that are &quot;full well known&quot; on conspiracy web sites are often not true at all. They repeat the same rumors and legends that have been repeated every year, but they don&#39;t check to see if they are actually true.</p>

<p>For example, you have just repeated &quot;The interest payments amount to %50 of American&#39;s tax dollars.&quot; You think that it&#39;s true, but it&#39;s not. You&#39;re repeating it here because you saw it on several web sites. But that&#39;s all that those web sites were doing. They were just repeating things that they thought were true.</p>

<p>Check any reputable web site, one that uses actual numbers from the federal budget. Interest on the debt is <a href="http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/budget_pie_gs.php">only 6% of the federal budget.</a> You can see what the interest on the debt is: 223.5 billion dollars. You can see what the total federal spending is: 3650.5 billion dollars. You can divide it yourself and get 0.061224. About 6%.</p>

<p>You can even download spreadsheets containing decades of data on the federal budget to check it yourself: <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals">http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals</a></p>

<p>Do any of the web sites that claim that it&#39;s 50% give the actual numbers? No. They can&#39;t, because <em>it&#39;s not true</em>.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve is audited every year: <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_12784.htm">http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_12784.htm</a></p>

<p>The stock of each regional Federal Reserve Bank is owned by all the member banks in that region. That includes the New York Fed. Every national bank in the district is a member. State-chartered banks are also allowed to join the Federal Reserve. For example, <a href="http://www.ny.frb.org/banks.html">here&#39;s a list of state-chartered members of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</a></p>

<p>The amount of stock that a member bank is required to hold is determined by the member bank&#39;s balance sheet. There are no individuals or families that own Federal Reserve stock. There never have been.</p>

<p>No matter how many shares the member bank holds, it gets <em>two</em> votes for choosing the directors for the regional Federal Reserve Bank. The big banks in each region pick two, the medium size banks pick two, and the small banks pick two. The remaining 3 directors are appointed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which is a federal agency. So, even if all the big banks in a region collude, they can only choose 2 out of the 9 directors for their region.</p>

<p>You should also learn how the federal government really borrows money.  Congress determines how much money is going to be spent and sets tax rates. It authorizes the Treasury Department to borrow the difference between what&#39;s needed for spending and the amount of taxes collected.
The Treasury Department holds an auction and sells Treasury bonds and Treasury bills to whoever wants to buy. This includes private individuals and foreign governments, banks, mutual funds, state governments, and so on.</p>

<p>These Treasury securities are bought and sold on a secondary market. The Federal Reserve buys some of these. Traditionally, it&#39;s only about 10% of them, but in the last 5 years, it&#39;s been a higher proportion. Since the Federal Reserve gives almost all of its profits to the government, it&#39;s great for the government when the Federal Reserve buys more bonds. The danger is more inflation, not more taxes.</p>

<p>In fact, that&#39;s the main reason that the Federal Reserve was set up as an independent body and not as just part of the Treasury Department. It&#39;s so tempting for the government to sell bonds to the central bank!</p>

<p>Because the Federal Reserve has been buying so many government bonds (and mortgage-backed securities), they&#39;ve been making a huge profit. A small part of that goes to the member banks, but that amount is set by law to a fixed percentage of the amount that the member bank has invested in the Federal Reserve. All the rest of the profit goes to the  federal government. In 2012, the Federal Reserve gave $88.4 billion to the government. In 2013, it was <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/other/20140110a.htm">$77.7 billion.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>State backed public banks would be fine, and totally Constitutional, they would be local and the money would be backed by &quot;Authorized Gold&quot;. State backed public banks would be by nature modular, and money would be backed by a fixed amount of &quot;Authorized Gold&quot;, that would never change. It could be a mixture of gold, silver, and platinum with very specifc ratios.</p>

<p>Each State backed Dollar will represent 1 picogram of &quot;Authorized Gold&quot;. There are 1 trillion pico grams in a gram. Each state would create 3 trillion in &quot;Authorized Gold&quot;, so it would only cost the state 3 grams of gold to do this, which is only $120.69</p>

<p>One trillion of the State Notes would be distributed to the people evenly and they could do what they want with it, save it, spend it, invest. All State Notes will look the same except for the State Initials printed somewhere on it.</p>

<p>Another 1.65 trillion in &quot;Authorized Gold&quot; would be kept in each public bank so that people, even billionaires, could transfer all their savings over to a State backed public bank. Also, people could change their United States Dollar notes to State backed dollar notes if they like, it would be an even exchange, and the State backed public banks could then dispose of the United States Dollar Notes that are traded in.</p>

<p>Each state would then give 350 billion, so that together between 50 states the 17.9 trillion dollar national debt would be completely paid off.</p>

<p>The State backed public banks would give the Federal Government a percentage of the interest that the State backed public banks make.</p>

<p>Since each State backed public bank would have a substantial interest income the Federal Government would get more than enough to fund the military.</p>

<p>Social Security will also be handled at the State level through interest income.</p>

<p>By doing this, there will be 50 state backed public banks, any american can bank at any one of them, no matter what state they are from, and inerest rates would be the same for all of them. Interest rates could be changed by a vote of 90% of the states.</p>

<p>Each different State&#39;s Dollar Note would be backed by the same amount of &quot;Authorized Gold&quot; (1 picogram) as all other states and the &quot;Authorized Gold&quot; would be stored separately in each state.</p>

<p>By doing this each State will be more solidified as an entity, and since there would be 50 public state backed public banks there would be no need for the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>By doing this right now, each state will take it&#39;s power back from the scumbag Federal Reserve Zionists, and it is perfectly Constitutional:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.blacklistednews.com/Are_Public_Banks_Unconstitutional%3F_No._Are_Private_Banks%3F_Maybe./35311/0/0/0/Y/M.html">http://www.blacklistednews.com/Are_Public_Banks_Unconstitutional%3F_No._Are_Private_Banks%3F_Maybe./35311/0/0/0/Y/M.html</a></p>

<p>This would eliminate inflation, and totally stop the scumbag Federal Reserve Zionists from destroying the United States and the entire world with their plan for a New World Order, or a One World Government.</p>

<p>And it will also protect your wealth when the Scumbag Federal Reserve Zionists decide to crash the United States Dollar.</p>

<p>Again, this proves there is absolutely no need for the Federal Reserve Bank.</p>

<p>REFERENCES:</p>

<p>Replace the Federal Reserve using Constitutional state backed public banks:</p>

<p>The thought is noble, but you <em>severely</em> underestimate the power that TPTB have at being able to divide and subsequently conquer the masses.  You also underestimate the power that <em>dividing</em> people has where it regards actually being able to get something worthwhile done.</p>

<p>United we stand.  Divided we fall.  And we are divided.  Truth-spreading is very difficult when 1) that truth is unnecessarily complicated by TPTB who constantly HIDE what the real truth is from the people and 2) when the people are so divided and at odds with one another that we do TPTB&#39;s job of obscuring the truth from us <em>for</em> them by simply constantly disagreeing with one another over petty things (like, perhaps, we&#39;re doing now, for example).</p>

<p>If TPTB&#39;s ability to divide and conquer the citizenry hadn&#39;t already been shown to be so successfully done so often in the past, then you might have a point.  However, it&#39;s simply been shown over and over again that THAT is one of the best ways to keep a people from succeeding at combating the manipulation against them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Independent actions: get state backed public banks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And how do you think the people will be able to do that if TPTB 1) don&#39;t let that happen, and 2) divide everyone in the process?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>buy gold with your dollars, put your wealth in either of these</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most people are a bit too busy trying to buy <em>food</em> with their dollars.  And those that aren&#39;t are usually too busy being so manipulated by the MSM that they&#39;re vying for the latest fashion to wear w/those dollars.  It&#39;s easy to <em>say</em> &quot;buy gold w/your dollars&quot;.  Not quite as easy to get people to actually do it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>grow your own food</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed.  That&#39;s a good idea.  However 1) a lot of people live in concrete jungles like NYC and Chicago where growing your own food isn&#39;t super convenient for them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>dont borow any monspend single dime more than you have to</p>

<p>Of course that&#39;s the case.  You have to define &quot;power&quot; in your sentence, however.  I have the power to make personal choices to do the little I can to not be a <em>complete</em> Fed whore - and I fight that power pretty decently every day, I feel.

</blockquote>

<p>I can kind of see that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>then i got to your convo and was fully convinced that person&#39;s either a plant or a dumbass who can&#39;t have a two sided conversation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  I was getting a bit of BOTH vibes here and there.  At times I was like &quot;Is this guy...like..clinically stupid or something? ...or maybe he&#39;s just...saying these things <em>on purpose</em>.  I don&#39;t know.&quot;</p>

<p>I still responded to his comments at face value as best as I could though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>my vote&#39;s on plant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  I&#39;m still a little bit undecided...but something was...off about some of his responses for sure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the 223 is also super subtle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hm?  What do you mean?  ELI5.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i&#39;m sorry you had the &quot;pleasure&quot; of communicating with that stranger. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>lol.  Yeah.  Pretty crazy, eh?  I wanted to follow the conversation through to the end though.  Crazy me...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i hope his upvotes aren&#39;t coming from random users, cuz that would make me a bit more saddened about our already bleak ass situation.</p>

<p>Yeah.  In one sense, our situation does indeed seem pretty darn bleak on this planet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i come across your post every now n then and i love your insight</p>

<p>Thank you, brother.  I try to not just post fluff or abject stupidity - although I guess I still do sometimes.  I come here to learn more than anything else, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>thanks for contributing your efforts to educate our species.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Life here is about learning and teaching, learning and teaching.  We must help each other as much as we can.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i can wait for the day i help by dying defending us (predominantly) deteriorating humans. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you mean to say you CAN&#39;T wait for the day?  If so, then let&#39;s not be in <em>too</em> much of a hurry.  I pretty much despise this life pretty heavily, but there are times when we can defend one another better while we&#39;re still alive more than we would be able to if we weren&#39;t.</p>

<p>Happy Sunday, my brother.</p>

<p>Ah.  But that wasn&#39;t Korn he was referencing.  It was the old 80s band <em>Cameo</em>.  Did Korn use Cameo&#39;s song &quot;Word Up&quot; in a song that I didn&#39;t know about?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i inferred that you enjoyed your blast from the past.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  I thought it was pretty unexpected and funny on arch&#39;s part - although I should have expected as much because he tends to regularly enough respond with cool, funny music video references and songs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i was just sayin that i like korn as well</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cool.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>especially word up! sorry for being so out of context</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...Damn.  I gotta do some Google searching now and see if Korn DID do a version of Cameo&#39;s song &quot;Word Up&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XimIbnMbeRE">Oh SHIT</a>!!  lol.  Damn.  Korn DID do a version of Cameo&#39;s &quot;Word Up&quot;!!</p>

<p>Dayem!!</p>

<p>Wow, man...I guess I just showed my age (and, perhaps, you just showed yours too) by the fact that I had NO idea what you were talking about when you mentioned &quot;Word Up&quot; and Korn and you had no idea what I was talking about when I mentioned &quot;Word Up&quot; and <em>Cameo</em>. lol.  I&#39;m LOLing right now. :)</p>

<p>I totally dig Korn, but the Korn that I&#39;m more familiar w/is the 1994 Korn from their first major eponymous release:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korn_(album)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korn_(album)</a></p>

<p>No worries.  :)</p>

<p>Yep.  That struck me as pretty weird/odd as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i was very displeased with how he called yours and other guys&#39; two comment korn talk &quot;clutter.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What he actually called &quot;clutter&quot; was <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/26z1z9/the_federal_reserve_bank_absolutely_must_be/chvu6fp">the initial comment I made</a> that we need to come together as one united people/citizenry before anything gets successfully accomplished.  He was calling <em>that</em> &quot;clutter&quot;.  This is what kind of made me initially think that the dude was/is either &quot;off&quot; in the head, or a possible shill of sorts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it was rude.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So rude and out of place, as a matter of fact, that I thought the dude simply misunderstood me or something.  I didn&#39;t even take any initial umbrage with his comment because the comment was <em>so</em> out of place and context actually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>however, like you said, he also seemed like he could have been certifiably stupid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  I was giving the benefit of the doubt, thinking maybe he, again, was just &quot;not right in the head&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>maybe he&#39;s l.d.?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>l.d?  What&#39;s that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>maybe he&#39;s a plant?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe...Not a very <em>good</em> plant, but maybe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>maybe he&#39;s a lab rat who got smart enough to use a computer?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LOL.  Okay that was fucking awesome.  Upvote alone just for <em>that</em> comment right there. lol</p>

<blockquote>
<p>haha, that&#39;d be awesome, but we really can&#39;t know</p>

<p>Yeah.  That&#39;d be fucking awesome.  If steveo223&#39;s just a super smart asshole labrat, then I think I might be able to just forgive all the craziness and say &quot;Aw shucks.  It&#39;s just a lab rat.  C&#39;mon.&quot; lol</p>

<p>Yeah.  Possibly.  Could be more to it than that, but could also be JUST that too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i too am curious to see how that convo would have played out to the end</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He seemed to kind of...chill w/me as the convo continued.  I think he either ultimately got tired of responding w/me since I write so damn much in my responses (lol - I like to be thorough, baby!), or - if he&#39;s a shill - he might have seen that he couldn&#39;t as easily thwart my perspective, etc.  I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Ha.  Well...I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d give this site quite THAT much credit, but I will say that there is indeed quite a bit of info in here that can be useful if one choses to use it in that manner.</p>

<p>Wait a minute, my brother...6:46 pm isn&#39;t really <em>that</em> late...and you have to be up by 11am?  Am I missing something?  If I have to be up by 11am, I can tend to be able to go to sleep by...2am-5am and still be up by 11 w/out too much trouble.  I can definitely sleep long hours too, but...are you getting to bed at like 7/8pm in order to have enough rest to get up by 11am?  That&#39;s like <em>sixteen</em> hours of sleep!  Wait a minute...Let me guess...Are you, <a href="http://www.omgfacts.com/Animals/The-lion-sleeps-for-20-hours-a-day/3470">a lion?  You&#39;re a lion, aren&#39;t you</a>?</p>

<p>Man, that&#39;s great.  Good for you (no sarcasm).  I don&#39;t quite have as positive a perspective, but I definitely don&#39;t knock people who do have it.  :)</p>

<p>Fuck.  Is that where the brain damage comes from?  Maybe not though, as I&#39;ve been clipped by cars riding my bike and have had some pretty bad biking accidents on the street and (as far as I know anyway) my brain didn&#39;t get any more compromised than it already is, so...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>troll bastard checkin in, lol. sorry i didn&#39;t get back to you yesterday, i had a busy day. we did show our ages. i couldn&#39;t remember who originally made the song until you dropped the name. back in the day i had thought korn&#39;s version was the original until i was rockin out to the song and my dad showed me cameo was the original artist. i enjoy both versions, but i take preference to korn&#39;s because i heard their&#39;s first. i get the feel from your reply that our korn, cameo mix up was pretty surreal. i had a good laugh about it. i&#39;ve been meaning to listen to korn&#39;s separate albums. i only ever had their greatest hits album.
fell in love with them forever.
to wrap up our talk about the weird dude, when i said l.d. i meant <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_disability">learning disabled.</a> i had a friend who was l.d, and he had a relatively hard time communicating and came off to people who were unaware as rather strange. you&#39;re right, if he is a plant he isn&#39;t is rude and of poor quality. that&#39;s why i hope he&#39;s a lab rat haha :] i&#39;d be pretty impressed if that were the case, so i couldn&#39;t even hate on &#39;em. you were definitely out of his league, though. i agree with you, i think he gave up because he knew he was out classed. about the skull and bones&#39; stuff though, who knows. it could of just been coincidence. those types of things are something i look out for on this sub because tptb love to put their tags in symbols hidden in plain sight. so it&#39;s not to far fetched to think that user was a bonie.
cheers :] when i say dictate my redditing i mean that i&#39;ll respond out loud to a post rather than make a post. mostly to express my thoughts about whatever i just saw/read. if i get some alcohol in me i&#39;ll be yelling about how stupid a post is and that whoever used a meme wrong. it&#39;s pretty entertaining to hear and it&#39;s actually pretty fun.
i don&#39;t mind you asking. it&#39;s definitely circumstantial. i was in an intense indoor soccer match back in 2008 and as a result of my over zealous use of my head i acquired what the doctor said were &quot;mini concussions.&quot; he and my dad ball parked that i got about 7 of them. then thanks to one of my teammates who wasn&#39;t exactly using his brains went to rip a shot from 5 or so feet right behind me without saying a word. i turned to get the ball, because i had just shot and it hit the crossbeam and popped right back over my head, and as i turned i saw him going for the shot and ducked to get out of the way. luckily for me i ducked right into the ball. hit me on the left side of my jaw. shattered 3 teeth, rattled my brain, froze everyone in the game, and made the whole crowd go &quot;ooooOOoooOo.&quot; once i got my bearings after like 5 seconds i saw the ball at my feet, shot, and scored. it was amazing. what wasn&#39;t so amazing was that i ended up blacking out not too long after that. came to about 30 minutes later with no clue what was going on. didn&#39;t know the day. thought it was july. it was december. kept asking the time every 10 seconds. no one in my house knew the symptoms of a concussion, so i was sent to bed. slept for two days straight. finally after my dad figured something was off, we went to the hospital. 3 days after the injury. do to the lack of treatment and me blacking out I&#39;ve been left with combo anterograde and retrograde amnesia. i have a very cheese holed memory of my life and skills before the accident. i also haven&#39;t made many new memories, relearned things, or learned new things because of the retrograde condition. it&#39;s made my life quite the uphill struggle, but i deal relatively well. this is how i explain my situation to people. let&#39;s say my brain is a physical computer with 4 gigs of ram (because i&#39;ve retained my acuity) and a badass amd processor. (because i still consider myself relatively intuitive) however, my hard drive has been formatted. the meta data is still on the disk, but i only have limited access to certain files. i also have a firmware issue regarding my save function and can only add new data after considerable computing. feel me? ever since the incident, i&#39;ve felt verrry &quot;reset.&quot; it&#39;s a blessing and a curse. blessing because i have a very fresh mind all the time. a curse because there isn&#39;t much on my mind ever really. except my task at hand. i also require about 12 hours of sleep to be completely refreshed for the next day, that&#39;s why i needed so much sleep the other day. so yes, i&#39;m a bit of a big cat. i prefer tigers over lions :] so my getting hit by a car had nothing to do with my damage. it did hurt though. got a cool lookin chin scar from it lol. thanks for not hatin on my positive outlook. i&#39;d rather be blissfully happy than all pessimistic. i&#39;m glad we agree on a lot of things. happy monday!</p>

<p>Yes they definitely do.  This world is awash with their symbolism.  I saw a doc a while back showing that their stamp is EVERYWHERE.  It&#39;s just really interesting once you realize that their shit is all over the place.  Nowadays, I rarely look at big buildings and gargoyles and bank emblems, etc the same way at all.</p>

<p>I see.  That is actually a very good thing to do.  What we are doing when we verbalize our thoughts - even if (or rather, especially when) there is no one else around and we are talking only to ourselves (which I do regularly enough) - is externalizing the often vague mental perceptions floating around in our minds in such a way that it significantly clarifies many of those abstract ramblings and brings them into <em>much</em> clearer focus.  Often our thoughts don&#39;t even tend to clearly formulate themselves until <em>after</em> we begin verbalizing them, not necessarily before.</p>

<p>Dictating your redditing, therefore, is actually a <em>much</em> better way to clarify the things that you post here.  :)  I try to make it a point to &quot;dictate my <del>redditing</del> <em>life</em>&quot;, as it often helps me have a much clearer focus on just what it is I&#39;m thinking - just what it is that is going on in my mind.</p>

<p>I can be/am a pretty psychotic rambler...and I&#39;m a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teetotalism">teetotaler</a>, so I don&#39;t have any excuse whatsoever for the ramblings aside from just being plain out crazy.  :)</p>

<p>i don&#39;t mind you asking. it&#39;s definitely circumstantial. i was in an intense indoor soccer match back in 2008 and as a result of my over zealous use of my head i acquired what the doctor said were &quot;mini concussions.&quot;</p>

<p>Awesome.  I&#39;ve been heavily involved in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing">pugilism</a> on both the amateur and professional levels for <em>maaany</em> years, so I know <em>all</em> about concussions.  :)</p>

<p>Reminds me of a monster I sparred a while back who all but tried to kill me in the ring.  It was crazy because even though I ultimately did okay against him (dropped him w/a body shot and made him quit), about 10-15 minutes after we were done sparring...I actually couldn&#39;t remember that I had just finished sparring...O_o.  I literally had no real memory of it.  I mean I know I HAD done it:  I was in a boxing gym, I was soaked in sweat, my boxing cup was still on...but I just couldn&#39;t actually remember the specifics of what happened during the session.  I was like &quot;Oh shit.  I have amnesia.&quot;</p>

<p>Your situation sounds quite a bit more intense...but yes.  It does sound like you&#39;re dealing with it relatively well indeed.</p>

<p>Rock on, then.  The calamitous events that have happened in my life have effected me in a bit too dire a fashion and have left a pretty bad taste in my mouth.  That&#39;s not to say that I&#39;m some sort of &quot;long suffering&quot; type.  It&#39;s not like I had a &quot;horrible&quot; childhood or anything.  Things just effected me enough to make me pretty sick of this life overall.

    <div class="md"><p>having a life in the real world is where it&#39;s at. like i&#39;m painting my new long board right now and am having the time of my life. i don&#39;t get how people can spend sooo much time on reddit. then complain about spending so much time on reddit. that shit grinds my gears. if you&#39;re unhappy with it, get off. but then there&#39;s the whole deal with having to actually  do something with themselves aaaand their back on reddit. it makes me sad and cracks me up at the same time. i like faget. it speaks to me a lot because i was treated in the same way by the world. still am. but they can suck my dick and fucking like it! ha! another of my favorites is twisted transistor. what an awesome song. i&#39;m convinced that dude is a stupid asshole. i&#39;ve met 3 l.d. people in my life, and each one at least has the ability to question and connect when they&#39;re in over their heads on subject matter. so fuck that lab rat, lol. hope he got a whole cheese wheel for passing the &quot;can he operate a cpu test.&quot; 
it&#39;s funny how once you&#39;ve gained the knowledge of the powers in charge of our country and can notice all their shenanigans with good evidence you&#39;re apparently just a &quot;paranoid.&quot; yet the proof is right there. i guess the old saying is true. in a world of complex lies, the simple truth is  even harder to believe. 
oh, it&#39;s very satisfying to let my thoughts take flight and actual verbal form. it&#39;s very conductive for my memory as well hearing my thoughts out loud and letting my brain getting it&#39;s much needed work out. like you said, it helps dictate my life :]
good for you for keepin clean! i keep pretty sober myself. maybe only get drunk drunk once a month. mostly just to get rowdy with my dudes. i still do a decent amount of yelling with zero alcohol. i like being loud :] the only other times i&#39;ll have a drink is with a meal. i had pork chops and a beer for dinner tonight, and it was heaven. applewood pork chops. i wish i had more. i&#39;d never heard the term teetotalor before. nor pugilism either. i&#39;ve only ever thrown punches at air. that would be one heck of a sport to get into though. i&#39;m sure you have an extensive knowledge on t.b.i&#39;s being involved in that. good for you though. i had a friend who was into boxing, and i could tell it was brutal. yea, that slight chance for head injury is the only thing that beats breaking  a leg in soccer, so it was a huge surprise for me once i figured out what the heck was going on.. like a week later. 
it never occurred to me that i would get a t.b.i. especially since i was a defender and had been taking massive headers for years. i&#39;m talkin punts from the goalie at the other end of the field soaring 200+ feet in the air and taking that shit with my forehead just to get possession. all of those and not any effect. one straight kick to the jaw (which i&#39;ve taken before) and it&#39;s game reset. the only reason i was able to tell you what happened was because my friend got it all on video. it was badass to watch myself score after getting hit. it made me not feel so weak after being down in the dumps about my new situation. i&#39;ll tell ya, it was the most bizarre thing ever to see a video of myself and have absolutely no clue what was going to happen. that was only the entrance to the rabbit hole. my friends tell me stories about myself on a weekly basis that i have no memory of. it tugs on my heart strings a bit, because i wish i could share in the memory. however, experiencing the new to me past is very cool also. seeing my friends remember is good enough for me.
my condition wouldn&#39;t have gotten so bad if i hadn&#39;t of blacked out and passed out. mostly because no one knew what was up at the time. i&#39;m sure it&#39;s waaay more tended to in the boxing world. i didn&#39;t fully elaborate on what i meant by it being a curse, because like you said it actually really isn&#39;t, so i&#39;ll go into that now. it&#39;s only a curse when other people are involved. when interacting with other people i&#39;m constantly struggling to keep up with what&#39;s exactly happening because most times i&#39;ll forget. like yesterday me and my dude were chillin play in Mario and he asked if i wanted to walk to t.bell. i said yup. he said we&#39;d leave in ten. ten minutes later he&#39;s puttin on his shoes and i ask &quot;where you goin?&quot; my state of mind is also a hindrance when having a group convo because if someone brings something up that rings a bell i&#39;ll space out, racking my database to figure out if i know what we&#39;re talking about. by the time i figure out i don&#39;t the convo has moved on and i can&#39;t even remember what it was i was trying to figure out to bring it up again. about 3 months after the accident i was sitting around with people at a party and the convo went to favorite sex positions. someone asked me mine and i had to answer &quot;i don&#39;t know, because i don&#39;t know if i&#39;ve had sex before.&quot; they all lost it at that and i got to explain everything i am to you now. so it puts a damper on experience related topics because i have to attempt to figure out if i&#39;ve ever done that thing, seen that movie, or know that band. it didn&#39;t take me very long to figure out that it&#39;s useless to try recollecting because i simply don&#39;t know. i don&#39;t have access to those &quot;files&quot; so it is a curse. BUT! on my own i am completely free. i don&#39;t have restrictions or prejudices on anything. i have an open and fresh ignorant outlook on everything i ever come into contact. it&#39;s like i get to experience the world with a clean slate. and i love every minute of it. i do have bad days occasionally, where&#39;s it&#39;s like the first day after the accident. i forget what the date is and what i have going on in my life, so i have to keep a piece of paper with the month and what i have goin on. sometimes i forget my phone number or if i have work in the morning. I&#39;ve lost 3 jobs because of that. but i kid you not, the next day it&#39;s like i never had the job at all and turns back into a blessing because i&#39;m not worried about a thing. which is the coolest part of it all; that even though i&#39;ve lost and continually lose memory, i retain my core essence and am the same person i&#39;ve always been. i&#39;m just lacking in specific knowledge. yet i&#39;m always in the effervescent now. untouched by the past and not worried about the future. i&#39;ve almost completely mastered nirvana and the eternal tao. like you said, things people struggle for years, many years to attain. i got unluckily lucky. came to terms with my situation, and now get to enjoy my life to the fullest.. i&#39;m just a happy person. and a bit of a tiger :]
i actually have a tiger tattoo. and sleep with a tiger blanket. it&#39;s the trigerfecta! haha!
i can understand where you&#39;re coming from about the circumstances of life. but like the professor finds a better world in science i&#39;m sure you have your happy place you dwell as well. lucky for all of us we don&#39;t have to endure the prisons we come to know forever. cheers, dude!</p>

<p>That&#39;s right.

We&#39;ve like totally hijacked it and are using it for our own purposes.  I find that kind of funny.</p>

<p>Yeah.  I guess it happened to me a little <em>initially</em> when I FIRST realize that the shit was everywhere.  I got over and through it pretty quickly, however, and don&#39;t feel that anymore.  Same w/911.  When I <em>first</em> found out that it was TPTB in <em>this</em> very country that literally murdered thousands of our brothers and sisters in that attack, I was taken aback quite a bit and cried.  I couldn&#39;t believe it.  That was a few years ago, however, and since then, I&#39;ve been researching that and other esoteric topics like mad.</p>

<p>Yes indeed it is.</p>

<p>Yep.  Exactly.  That&#39;s what verbalization often does.  It often helps one get even better visualization than abstract thought alone.</p>

<p>But your bro knows this about you though, right?  So he&#39;s cool with it...right?  In which case, it&#39;s all good, right?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, I&#39;m personally not a big fan of group convos at all and, as a result, I rarely have gotten in them (groups or group convos).  I&#39;ve found that group conversations can be very &quot;small talky&quot;, but the thoughts I have can kind of tend to be somewhat long-winded and complicated, so the two don&#39;t mix well.</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve said before, I&#39;m not a &quot;people person&quot; <em>at all</em>.  I <em>am</em>, however, a &quot;<em>person</em> person&quot; - i.e. you get me in a group with various people and you&#39;re liable to think I&#39;m a mute because you might not hear a peep out of me.  You get me in a one on one conversation with one individual person, however?  I can talk for hours. lol</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it puts a damper on experience related topics because i have to attempt to figure out if i&#39;ve ever done that thing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Man...that sounds <em>awesome</em>.  I can&#39;t tell you how many great, <em>huge</em> portions of my life I would simply rather forget and wish never existed. lol</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i don&#39;t have access to those &quot;files&quot; so it is a curse.</p>

<p>Damn.  Isn&#39;t it crazy what we call curses and blessings?  One person&#39;s curse is another person&#39;s boon, I guess.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>BUT! on my own i am completely free.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See, I guess that&#39;s the thing w/me then, cuz I&#39;m almost <em>always</em> on my own.  I have a gf that I speak to regularly but, aside from that...there&#39;s really nothing.  No friends, no nothing.  I have acquaintances - people I know, etc - but I can&#39;t really say I have any &quot;friends&quot;...people I regularly hang out w/or anything.  Nothing like that.  As such, I do spend a lot of time on my own.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i have an open and fresh ignorant outlook on everything i ever come into contact. it&#39;s like i get to experience the world with a clean slate. and i love every minute of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s awesome.</p>

<p>Oh here&#39;s a question:  Do you drive?  Do you live on your own?  <em>Will</em> you live on your own? and if/when you do, will you have to follow any special guidelines to make sure you, for example, remember where you live, etc?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i forget what the date is and what i have going on in my life, so i have to keep a piece of paper with the month and what i have goin on. sometimes i forget my phone number or if i have work in the morning. I&#39;ve lost 3 jobs because of that.</p>

<p>which is the coolest part of it all; that even though i&#39;ve lost and continually lose memory, i retain my core essence and am the same person i&#39;ve always been. i&#39;m just lacking in specific knowledge</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that fucking <em>awesome</em>?  And you know what that shows?  That shows that we are NOT our memories.  Our essence, personality, core, etc is <em>not</em> strictly a collection of psychological impressions.  Things go <em>much</em> deeper than that.</p>

<p>Fucking awesome - excuse my french.</p>

<p>That&#39;s so very cool, bro.  I want to ask when your birthday is, but I don&#39;t want you to feel like you&#39;re giving too much info over the interwebs.  What&#39;s your sign at least?  Are you a Libra?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m located mid east in the buckeye state, so i do all my surfing on concrete. i want to surf so fucking bad though. sadly i&#39;ve only been to the beach once in my life, and thanks to the scrambled eggs that are my brains i don&#39;t recall much from the trip. the furthest west i&#39;ve ever been is indiana :[ i would love to go out west though. too bad i&#39;m poor. at least i&#39;m not a web addict and am getting outside to enjoy this sunshiney tuesday! i haven&#39;t put my board back together though, so i&#39;ve been walking everywhere today. until my car got totaled, i used to love just cruisin. i&#39;d fill the tank up and just explore the roads and towns of my state. it was always a good time. 
lol, my bad! john davis is the man! op is the asshole. damn straight we hijacked this shit. it&#39;s awesome. i find it even funny that we came to connect and take over all because of op and their shenanigans. suck it op!
i do my best to spread knowledge on what&#39;s goin on with all the symbolism n such when i can. it also helps with figuring out who&#39;s &quot;awake&quot; and still a &quot;sheep.&quot; i&#39;ve found the typical person could give two shits less about it all and doesn&#39;t even look twice at the info. i classed it with religion in this sense; they&#39;ve gotta find it for themselves. if they don&#39;t have any conviction of it on their own they won&#39;t listen to a word i&#39;m saying. 
and damn! you&#39;ve been boxing longer than i&#39;ve been alive! snaps to you! you could be a trainer with that kind of experience. 
yea i saw the video of my brain&#39;s destruction. it felt like i was in a dream when watching it. i wish i still had it to share with ya. seeing the event really helped me put some of the puzzle pieces of my life back together because i at least had a grounded point in my timeline as a place to start.
i ask and inquire when i can get someone to step away from being on the in crowd and teach me. that&#39;s the best way. when i interject into the group it just derails everybody there. whenever i explain what&#39;s with me to strangers they just get weird and treat me strangely. so i just follow the flow of the group and try my best to relate. or will go do something else or just keep busy with something. it&#39;s best when i&#39;ve got a buddy there that i can secretly be like &quot;what&#39;s he talking about?&quot; to, cuz he&#39;ll give me the 411. i only have one real friend at this point in my life, and he&#39;s super cool with my predicament. he&#39;s helpful and informative, and thinks it&#39;s the funniest thing ever when i space out. especially when i forget silly things. we&#39;re kindred spirits he and i, so it works really well. plus he has a cool ass gf who nurtures me a bit. so that&#39;s nice, haha. i feel ya all the way, i&#39;m much more of a person person. i don&#39;t hold a lot of the same opinions and convictions as most people, so if you get me in a group i&#39;m the odd man out. God forbid i ever share a thought of mine in a group, because then it&#39;s make fun of this kids originality skit. so i just hush up and be my happy self. then come home to my sanctuary of solidarity and enjoy it ever so. i don&#39;t drive right now, because i got tboned by a drunky last year and he totaled my car. i lost my license though because the cops searched our cars and found two vicodin pills in my cup holder. i didn&#39;t have a script for em, so i got charged. it was not cool. firstly because i was in a massive amount of pain. they were for my shattered teeth because two of the have become abcessed. then my car gets slammed and i get cut and bruised and my car is rendered useless. then i get in trouble?! i was not a happy camper that night. driving is a challenge though, and the issues apply to just daily living in general, because while i&#39;m driving i&#39;ll forget where i&#39;m going or how to get there. sometimes i&#39;ll forget why i&#39;m going wherever, then how to get there, then what road i&#39;m on and where i&#39;m at, so i&#39;d just go home. it&#39;s not so drastic when it involves things i&#39;m familiar with, but if i&#39;m going somewhere new to do something i don&#39;t usually do it can be hell in a hand basket addressed to me. living on my own (i don&#39;t at the moment) is heaven. i used to not look a clock for 20 hours or more because I&#39;d have no reason to give a shit about time. it got me in trouble sometime with work n such, but i could care less. oh i&#39;m fired because i overslept my shift by 12 hours? alright, guess i&#39;ll go back to bed. i&#39;ll start lookin for work in a day or two. livin on my own with work i had to keep an eye on time, without work i used to get lost in research, projects, and books for endless uninterrupted hours. heaaaaaven. now I&#39;ve got to keep schedule with the world, my housemates, and keep my mom&#39;s boyfriend&#39;s kid entertain. so i don&#39;t get to be a shut in as much as I&#39;d like. i need to get back to it though, because i can feel my mental elasticities slipping without them getting their exersice.
i&#39;ll look up momento. i&#39;ve never seen it. it&#39;s good to be relieved of bad memories, but i also have lost a lot of what i&#39;d like to remember. but i can make new ones. i&#39;m a cancer of july btw. i have no clue what the signs indicate because i haven&#39;t studied up on the zodiac at all.
is that tat a sigil? what is it? looks cool. do you study the occult</p>

<p>Yeah, man.  That&#39;s just totally awesome.  That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;ve done on such a regular basis for long enough now that I actually have a not super easy time actually finding some area that I haven&#39;t already explored at least somewhat.  </p>

<p>it also helps with figuring out who&#39;s &quot;awake&quot; and still a &quot;sheep.&quot;</p>

<p>Indeed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i&#39;ve found the typical person could give two shits less about it all and doesn&#39;t even look twice at the info. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.  I agree.  My gf is <em>much</em> more aware now, but only because she&#39;s w/me and I&#39;ve gotten to talking w/her about it a lot more.  Lots of resistance at first.  She&#39;s a lot more aware now though that I&#39;ve shown her so many examples that are simply difficult to deny.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i classed it with religion in this sense; they&#39;ve gotta find it for themselves. </p>

<p>Agreed.  At best, you can only lead the horse to water.  You can&#39;t make it drink.</p>

<p>:)  Yeah.  I kind of thought that might be the case - and not because I think you&#39;re some &quot;young child&quot;, but because I&#39;m a lot older than reddits normal demographic.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I do have one fighter that I train, but the thing is that I don&#39;t actually consider myself to be or look at myself as a &quot;trainer&quot; per se.  Boxing&#39;s just something I&#39;ve done for a long time and, as a result, I know a LOT about it.</p>

<p>Agreed...and I don&#39;t necessarily want to take everyone away from whatever they were talking about, so I just as soon say little if I find myself in a group type of situation.</p>

<p>whenever i explain what&#39;s with me to strangers they just get weird and treat me strangely.</p>

<p>I&#39;d personally be full of questions likely.</p>

<p>driving is a challenge though, and the issues apply to just daily living in general, because while i&#39;m driving i&#39;ll forget where i&#39;m going or how to get there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah man.  I was thinking I&#39;d probably have an even greater level of rigor and responsibility in the things I do than is already the case if I were dealing with a similar situation.  As it stands right now, Alzheimer&#39;s runs <em>suuuuper</em> deep in my family and, even though it might just be me being paranoid, I swear I can already feel myself getting more forgetful.  It is what it is though, so as a result, I&#39;ve just made it a point to definitely jot down anything that&#39;s important or that I don&#39;t want to forget or that I have to do, etc, because I know there&#39;s a pretty good chance that I&#39;m going to forget about it if I don&#39;t have an external reminder.</p>

<p>Also, when driving, I use the GPS a <em>lot</em>.  I&#39;ve always had a not great sense of direction, so I tend not to take directions for granted...ever really.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>sometimes i&#39;ll forget why i&#39;m going wherever, then how to get there, then what road i&#39;m on and where i&#39;m at, so i&#39;d just go home.</p>

<p>Yeah.  Write shit down, my brother.</p>

<p>&quot;Going to the store to get bread.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Going to &#39;such and such person&#39;s&#39; house to hang out.&quot;</p>

<p>etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if i&#39;m going somewhere new to do something i don&#39;t usually do it can be hell in a hand basket addressed to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regular diligence and responsibility can account for and address a good portion of that.  Trust me, I know.  I forget things ALL the time and go &quot;What the hell was I supposed to do now?&quot;  and then I pull out the little scrap of paper in my pocket, see that it says &quot;get groceries from store&quot; and I go &quot;ahh.  that&#39;s it.  got it.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>oh i&#39;m fired because i overslept my shift by 12 hours? alright, guess i&#39;ll go back to bed</p>

<p>lol.  Damn.  Awesome.  Rock on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i&#39;ll look up momento. i&#39;ve never seen it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a cool flick.  Definitely check it out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s good to be relieved of bad memories, but i also have lost a lot of what i&#39;d like to remember.</p>

<p>That&#39;s certainly fair to say.</p>

<p>i&#39;m a cancer of july btw</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ha.  What day, bro?  You and I are very kin types.  I&#39;m a scorpio of november - &quot;cancer&#39;s perfect match&quot;, as is said.  My gf&#39;s a cancer, and the saying has quite a lot of validity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i have no clue what the signs indicate because i haven&#39;t studied up on the zodiac at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m decently familiar w/them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>is that tat a sigil? what is it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Didn&#39;t even know what a sigil is.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_(magic">Just found out</a>).  I would imagine that it can or has been used as a sigil, but the symbol itself is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monas_Hieroglyphica">The Hieroglyphic Monad of John Dee</a>.  It&#39;s a symbol that represents the center of wisdom in the universe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>do you study the occult</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Very much so.  I have a degree in Philosophy, and much of my life has been geared toward the investigation of those things that lie hidden underneath the surface.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>haha, let the highjacking continue! that symbol&#39;s sick and i love it&#39;s meaning. john dee sounds legit. i&#39;ve been meaning to delve into the occult and hidden mystery studies more in depth, but i haven&#39;t made myself compile a curriculum to study. mostly because i don&#39;t think it would be very beneficial or useful to me.any recommendations?  the most esoteric thing i really get into is chi work. i&#39;ve read zero books and do zero studying haha. all i do is practice. energy manipulation is my specialty and i was getting pretty good at it until i stopped for a few months and lost my touch. i&#39;m just now getting it back. i hope to do a lot of practice and mastering this summer.
that and get back in shape. going running is definitely on the list. won&#39;t be running 3 to 5 miles for a while, but eventually! i do try to bring up certain aspects of topics when others get into a convo (about 9.11, snowden, or sandy hook) about things related to topics of the sub. most people think i&#39;ve been misinformed and &quot;it&#39;s not what they&#39;ve heard, so it can&#39;t be true.&quot; yet they&#39;re only getting their info from the mainstream so i tell them that that&#39;s precisely why they wouldn&#39;t have any clue about the reality of the topic. and i get the &quot;you&#39;re looking into it too much.&quot; so i usually try to get them to start questioning things with a &quot;so you can believe everything the news will tell you no questions asked, why can&#39;t you do the same for any random individual?&quot; &quot;well you&#39;re not the news&quot; &quot;i could be. and technically i&#39;m the same thing. an entity sharing my view of a situation backed by my knowledge. there&#39;s no difference.&quot; &quot;well then you&#39;re just wrong.&quot; &quot;maybe to someone who refuses to investigate facts and let them do the talking.&quot; &quot;are you saying i&#39;m wrong?&quot; &quot;not entirely, i&#39;m saying you&#39;ve been lied to, so you&#39;re misinformed. say that for all your life you knew the sky was blue. no question about it.&quot; &quot;okay..&quot; &quot;now say tomorrow CNN came on and said the sky was green. would you change your mind?&quot; &quot;of course not!&quot; &quot;why not?&quot; &quot;i&#39;d know it wasn&#39;t true&quot; &quot;okay, so let&#39;s  say you KNEW for a fact 9.11 was a false flag and CNN told you it was alquida. would you change your mind?&quot; &quot;if that was the case no.&quot; &quot;well i and millions of other people are telling you that we know for a fact that 9.11 was put together by the u.s. gov. why can&#39;t you entertain the thought?&quot; &quot;cuz that&#39;s not what i think.&quot; &quot;it&#39;s not about what you think, it&#39;s about what&#39;s real. and the reality is you&#39;ve been lied to.&quot; &quot;i don&#39;t believe that.&quot; &quot;whether you believe it or not, it&#39;s a fact.&quot; &quot;that&#39;s not true&quot; &quot;so you think. i&#39;ll show you some things and let me see what you think afterwards.&quot; this is a convo i had with a 56 year old dude the other day, and i showed him about project mockingbird and a 9.11 debunker vid. even a bit about the occult side of the event because he knows some about secret societies. so after i shed a bit of light and posed the question &quot;since all of this is factual and you&#39;ve been brought to speed. do you still think you&#39;ve been told the truth?&quot; &quot;absolutely not. i wonder what else the media has lied about?&quot; i chuckled pretty good and said &quot;a lot.&quot;
this was the first time in two years i could get someone to believe that they could be mistaken and sway their opinion. everyone else will humor me throughout and just refuse to accept the facts presented to them. it&#39;s a personal thing I&#39;ve found out. some people come at it logically and others take an opinionated emotional stance. with the prior it&#39;s pretty simple to convince because it&#39;s a matter of presenting the proof. the later is much more difficult because they&#39;ll deny the sky is blue just because that&#39;s what they decide to do. i ask them to take an hour to look into it and most say no. others say OK and come back saying that it just doesn&#39;t feeeel real, so it ain&#39;t true. others will come back and apologize for being so stubborn. it&#39;s touchy shit because most people get pissed that they could be wrong about the topic and lash out. i mostly just do nudging to get people to question what they think they know. my success rate is low because most people just can&#39;t accept the truth. how&#39;s it go on your end?
no further t.b.i. from the accident. just an 8000 dollar insurance claim because my monthly payment hadn&#39;t hit for a few days, so technically i was uninsured. so of course i get the butt end of getting hit by a drunk driver. i like to use the decepticon moto when talking about the popo. &quot;to punish and enslave&quot; harm and violate works also.
believe me, i have a pen and pad on me at all times. what i described to you about driving was back during the six months just after the accident. things are much better now. i still constantly am writing things down though, because i never know when something will slip my mind.
my bday&#39;s the 16 btw. i&#39;ll be the big two two this year.
edit: i feel ya on the unemployment. i haven&#39;t had a job in 6 months and am having no luck finding work. it&#39;s depressing</p>

<p>Well, give that &quot;occult&quot; just means &quot;hidden&quot;, the fact that you&#39;re in this subreddit is a pretty decent start where it regards researching the occult.</p>

<p>Oh I think the fact that you&#39;re in this sub indicates that you feel researching the hidden and often manipulative/conspiratorial aspects of the occult are <em>very</em> beneficial and useful to you.  You&#39;re just not <em>calling</em> it or looking at it as &quot;the occult&quot; per se, but any real research or investigation into the hidden meaning of things qualifies in that category.  Heck, all the symbolism in buildings - as one example that we&#39;ve talked about - qualifies in this area.</p>

<p>Well, given that it was a 56 year old man, I&#39;d say that was a <em>big deal</em> that you were able to sway <em>their</em> opinion.  That&#39;s no small feat.</p>

<p>My main &quot;captive audience&quot; is my girlfriend since she&#39;s the one I talk to the most.  She was pretty obstinate and close-minded on these issues for a while, but I simply kept bringing them up.  We would fight and argue a lot over things like that, but I just kept grinding and bringing things and issues up.  Over years of persistence, she&#39;s gotten much more aware of the manipulation that exists - especially since she can&#39;t deny some of the evidence I&#39;ve shown her.  Now she&#39;s quite a bit more understanding of things and is willing to grasp that often time the reality of things is <em>not</em> what it appears to be on the surface.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>most tattoos of wisdom i&#39;ve come across have been at the top of the spine. i like how you took it all the way to the top of the dome. very cool. yea, you&#39;re right. however, here most subject matter is more political and of the circumstances regarding the way things are. even though it&#39;s not completely textbook, when i reference occult i&#39;m talking more about things like ancient mystery religions and things of spiritual nature. which does play into this sub some, but most posters don&#39;t talk about it much, if at all. i&#39;ll check that vid out when i get the chance. i&#39;d watch it now, but i&#39;ve already committed tonight to watching godzilla and getting my longboard all dolled up.
&quot;ounce of practice, pound of theory.&quot; could not agree more. when i first got into it, i spent so much time reading and reading with some practice, and everything i read conflicted with everything else i read and i couldn&#39;t make up my mind which to put into practice. so i said fuck it and decided to make my own technique. it has worked wonders. my energy levels had never been more potent and my manipulation skills were stronger then ever. i was almost strong enough to ignite my own flame! then i had to start working, and just fell out of practice. i actually put my nose to the grindstone again 2 weeks ago yesterday and already feel much more empowered. i can&#39;t wait to see my progress by the end of the summer.
oh God i would love to go hiking in the mountains. there are some very nice forest in my area, so i&#39;m content with what i have. i would love to be able to travel all over though. the old man was at least compliant. if i every try to sway people my age it almost never works.
glad to hear you could get your girl to see the truth.
and oh boy i am owing 8.5 g&#39;s for getting hit by a p.o.s. the dude had insurance and i didn&#39;t. the judge was a tool and claimed that i had broken more laws and should be &quot;taught&quot; to be more obedient to the law. i told him that the only thing i was being taught was that even if you&#39;re 95% innocent you&#39;ll get fucked in the ass for being 5% guilty.
he held me in contempt of court for arguing. got community service for that charge to &quot;teach me some respect.&quot; i was livid. but of course i had to keep my mouth shut to avoid anymore judicial rape. one of the most bullshit experiences of my life.
cool coincidence on the birthdays. to an outsider a thing like that makes the relationship all that much cooler.
you could straight be my dad though, dude. my mom only turned 43 in march, and my dad will be 44 in august.
those two have called me crazy since i started bringing up anything conspiracy or spiritually related. you get extra brownie points for being 20 years my senior, educated, and cool. happy tuesday, bro.</p>

<p>i like how you took it all the way to the top of the dome.</p>

<p>To the <a href="http://adishakti.org/images/seventh_chakra_sahasrara.gif">Sahastrara chakra</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when i reference occult i&#39;m talking more about things like ancient mystery religions and things of spiritual nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much of what <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/85160653/Vivekananda">Swami Vivekananda says</a> I find relevant in this area.  Baird T Spalding&#39;s <a href="http://www.horuscentre.org/images/Life_and_Teaching-Vol_1.pdf">The Life And Teaching Of The Masters Of The Far East</a> has some pretty amazing info in it as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i&#39;ve already committed tonight to watching godzilla and getting my longboard all dolled up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m planning on watching the new Godzilla movie when it comes out in the $1 redbox rentals (cheapskate that I am).  It actually looks like a <em>good</em> version of the series.  Don&#39;t come back and give me any spoilers and ruin it for me either!  Argh!  ;)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>my energy levels had never been more potent and my manipulation skills were stronger then ever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What were you doing to practice and improve? and in what manner did you feel your skills improve and become stronger?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i was almost strong enough to ignite my own flame!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very, very interesting, sir.  I&#39;d be much more interested in knowing a little bit more about this if you have any info you can link or anything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>oh God i would love to go hiking in the mountains</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Man...It was pretty intense to say the least.  On the last hike, we were so far up in the mountains that we were actually looking <em>down</em> at the clouds.  Shit was crazy, man.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if i every try to sway people my age it almost never works</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  And that&#39;s, unfortunately, because the younger one is, the more one tends to be influenced by the MSM and the crap that TPTB put out to give to and cloud/stunt the people&#39;s minds.</p>

<p>&quot;Youth is wasted on the young.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>glad to hear you could get your girl to see the truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, it&#39;s definitely a work in progress.  It&#39;s not like I got her to see &quot;the <em>whole</em> truth&quot;.  Heck, it&#39;s not like I even know what &quot;the whole truth&quot; is.  Far from it.  I just got her to open her eyes up a lot more than they previously were is all.  Again, though, it&#39;s definitely a work in progress.</p>

<p>We are all a work in progress.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i told him that the only thing i was being taught was that even if you&#39;re 95% innocent you&#39;ll get fucked in the ass for being 5% guilty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that about sounds like what the truth is.  I tell you, man...this world...It&#39;s shit like this that makes me look forward to no longer being on this prison planet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>he held me in contempt of court for arguing. got community service for that charge to &quot;teach me some respect.&quot; i was livid. but of course i had to keep my mouth shut to avoid anymore judicial rape.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Damn...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you could straight be my dad though, dude.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  I could&#39;ve had you when I was twenty right?  Damn.  Crazy...</p>

<p>Yet here I am...No wife, no kids, living on my own as a &quot;jobless starving artist bachelor&quot; type trying to scrape two pennies together to pay rent.  :)  Good times, baby!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>my mom only turned 43 in march</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Holy shit that is <em>so</em> insane. lol.  Doesn&#39;t it feel like you&#39;re talking to another dude <em>your</em> age?  And here you are talking to someone that under other circumstances you might call or look at as &quot;an old fogey&quot;.  Shit is crazy, man. lol.</p>

<p>I guess the thing is that, even though I&#39;ve never (EVER) considered myself &quot;young at heart&quot; (have felt forty since I was about 15), there are many things about me and the way I live that are very...how shall we say...&quot;dude&quot;-like.  A lot of what I do and how I live can be considered to be things that a &quot;young&quot; person would do, but...well, here I am...doing them anyway.  :)  Go figure.  I&#39;m an artist, and have simply been plying my craft for a long time, trying to make a living at it, and that&#39;s where I&#39;m at.  :)</p>

<p>And your mom&#39;s b-day is in March?  March what?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>those two have called me crazy since i started bringing up anything conspiracy or spiritually related.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course they have.  A lot of older folks simply don&#39;t understand/can&#39;t handle those things.  It&#39;s too much for them.  And it&#39;s funny that I call then &quot;older folks&quot; when they&#39;re MY GODDAMN AGE...But they still seem/feel &quot;older&quot; than me, so I&#39;ll still lump them in with the &quot;older folks&quot; anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you get extra brownie points for being 20 years my senior, educated, and cool.</p>

<p>:)  Big smile.  :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there&#39;s the term. i can never remember the long names of the chakras. if i had called where it is what it was i would of just said crown chakra. i need to restudy my chakras. i use the seven of them as a whole, and they all could use some individual maintenance. i&#39;ll add those links to my list of things to read. thanks. and i&#39;m watching the 98 version with broderick. and that maria pitillo! she&#39;s a looker. can&#39;t say i&#39;ve seen her in anything else though. so no worries on spoilers. i&#39;m too poor to see the new one. it does look sweet though. 
to max out my training i stopped smokin the dope, quit drinking, only ate fruits, veggies, and fresh meats, did an exercise routine 3 times a day, abstained from television and computer usage until necessary for a task; once task complete i&#39;d get off, and practiced and meditated for 2 hours before bed time. the only things i ever tried and try to do to practice is energy absorbing and emitting, because those are the basics and the groundwork for pretty much all energy work. absorbing through every fiber of my being through meditation and emitting (mostly) through my hands through concentration. i mixed/will mix it up with my feet and head just to stay loose, but my hands are where my output is at it&#39;s highest. i used to experiment with  displacing it under my body, but wasn&#39;t strong enough to accomplish my intended task; levitation. my own technique and training regiment used to be to remain as much in a meditative state as i could all day while absorbing as much energy as i could all day. the same the next day, but with emitting energy through my hands all day long.  i, and anyone else could too, feel myself improving with how quickly i could draw out my energy, my endurance with releasing my energy, the force i could emit with my energy, and could tell by the more prominent influence i could produce on objects; like a force push and pull. another way i would practice is with a candle. trying to still the flame, move it left and right, make it grow and shrink, put it out and relight it. i could put it out, but never relight it. i felt like i was really close though. known as <a href="http://psi.wikia.com/wiki/Pyrokinesis">pyrokinesis</a> and at the most extreme level of example i can give you is <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn3h2WRW05c&amp;amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player">this man.</a>
the pyro demo is at 1.57. the rest is interesting as well.
worth the watch and not 2 hours long :b
being higher than the clouds would be incredible. i can barely get people i know to go for a walk let alone hike up a mountain. everyone just wants to go clubbing. yaaaay..... their youth really is wasted, and one day they&#39;ll realize it.
yea, luckily most of us are progressing, so keep her learning! haha. i know i&#39;ll do the same.
that court shit was bullshit and ridiculous. makes me want to buy an island and never leave it. you&#39;re right, this isn&#39;t the kind of world i want to live in.
sounds to me like you&#39;ve got it goin on. other than penny pinchin, but that&#39;ll happen now and again. i hear it&#39;s a frequent occurrence in the art world. and you got a girlfriend, so aside from penny rubbin and starvin, I&#39;d say you got it goin on. unless a wife and kids is more you&#39;re thing. i&#39;m a fan of wives and love kids, but i don&#39;t want to raise a kid in today&#39;s world. not to mention how loco girls my age are, haha. plus chicks don&#39;t want anything to do with a jobless street rat living in mom&#39;s boyfriend&#39;s basement. but whatever, more time for me to spend with me.
it&#39;s very cool and the age barrier is eliminated. i feel it would be in person as well. you&#39;re far from old fogey material. those bags are at least 55, think bill oreilly is a prophet, and hate rock n roll. you are like an elder-dude who&#39;s still with it. that&#39;s prabably why you made it to forty. your ball&#39;s still rollin, so your body&#39;s not gonna give out on you yet. not to mention all that exercise. keep it up and you&#39;ll be on the dude&#39;s dude level. glad you&#39;ve stuck with it, man.
my mom&#39;s day is the 25th. and no problem!</p>

<p>Hell I can&#39;t say I ever even knew them to begin with.  But Google, baby!  <em>Goggle!</em>  :)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Exactly.  The crown chakra.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i need to restudy my chakras.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I kind of need to study them <em>period</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i use the seven of them as a whole, and they all could use some individual maintenance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I allow the swadhisthana chakra to have much too much sway in this life.  In one sense, it can be said that it&#39;s part of what naturally and intuitively goes along with being my particular sign.  In another, I <em>still</em> feel I still give that chakra&#39;s influence far too much relevance even for a profile with my natural tendencies and characteristics.</p>

<p>Ah.  Okay.  The 98 version.  Haven&#39;t seen that one.</p>

<p>Redbox, baby!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>meditated for 2 hours before bed time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely <em>awesome</em>.  A few years ago, I was pretty steadfastly meditating for quite a stretch.  I still do it regularly enough now, but only for short spells and not in as regimented a manner as used to be the case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>my hands are where my output is at it&#39;s highest.</p>

<p>What outputs through your hands?  Energy - yes...but...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>my own technique and training regiment used to be to remain as much in a meditative state as i could all day while absorbing as much energy as i could all day</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  This is the very thing I do now actually (minus the conscious absorption of energy part).  I work not so much on meditating per se, but at simply being in a meditative state overall and as much as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the same the next day, but with emitting energy through my hands all day long.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What kind of energy?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and could tell by the more prominent influence i could produce on objects;</p>

<p>What kind of influence?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>like a force push and pull.</p>

<p>A telekinetic influence?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>pyrokinesis and at the most extreme level of example i can give you is this man</p>

<p>Yeah I totally remember seeing the video of that man a while back.  Pretty impressive indeed.  Are you familiar with Ram Bahadur Bomjan AKA Dharma Sangha?  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fPz3omqxFw">Absolutely insane stuff.  Amazing abilities this kid has shown</a>.</p>

<p>Ha.  Okay.</p>

<p>Things could always be better...but things could certainly be a lot worse than they are, so I try to be grateful as often as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>unless a wife and kids is more you&#39;re thing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, it&#39;s really ultimately about being a responsible human being as far as I&#39;m concerned.  I would actually <em>prefer</em> to be in an &quot;ideal/perfect&quot; relationship and have a decent/steady income coming in.  And if that were the case?  Then I think I <em>would</em> have had kids/a kid.  However, that&#39;s most definitely not the case in my life.  Things most definitely <em>aren&#39;t</em> conducive toward that.  I&#39;m a broke ass, poor ass artist, and although my gf and I have been together for coming on a frickin&#39; <em>decade</em> (pretty long time) and it doesn&#39;t look like we&#39;re breaking up any time soon (if ever in this life), we&#39;ve had (and still have) enough problems and issues that it&#39;s kind of understood that it would be stupid and ignorant and dumb and selfish - not to mention just plain/outright cruel actually - to bring another life into this world with as many problems as exist in it.  She&#39;d be <em>totally</em> cool w/having a kid, but...Well...nope.  I can&#39;t do it.  This world is just WAY too fucked up for me to feel right about bringing another life in to it.  That would just be <em>way</em> too cruel and stupid on my part if I were to actually purposefully do that.  Nope.</p>

<p>If I were a developed and advanced enough person myself and had a developed and advanced enough partner to help me?  Then awesome.  Hell yeah.  Lets do it.  I&#39;d be a parent, and feel that I&#39;d be an AWESOME parent.  Seriously.</p>

<p>However, since those things <em>aren&#39;t</em> the case in this life, the responsible thing to do is simply not endanger and encumber another life by bringing it into this abandoned, God forsaken world.</p>

<p>...Ha!  Good times, baby!  Yeah!</p>

<p>As you can see, I have a <em>very</em> rosy, cheary attitude about the world!  :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i&#39;m a fan of wives and love kids, but i don&#39;t want to raise a kid in today&#39;s world.</p>

<p>You said in one sentence what it took me a few paragraphs to describe.  Ha.  Story of my long-winded life I guess. :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you&#39;re far from old fogey material.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah well.  I at least don&#39;t <em>feel</em> like I&#39;m &quot;old fogey&quot; material for whatever it&#39;s worth.  :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>your ball&#39;s still rollin, so your body&#39;s not gonna give out on you yet.</p>

<p>Yeah.  I think they&#39;re roll a bit <em>too</em> much though.</p>

<p>not to mention all that exercise. keep it up and you&#39;ll be on the dude&#39;s dude level.</p>

<p>Yeah.  I&#39;m a teetotaler, don&#39;t smoke, haven&#39;t eaten meat in coming on ten years, run about 10-20 miles up a mountain 4-6 days a week, and box on a regular basis.</p>

<p>I guess if I wanted to <em>not</em> make it to the age of 40, this was NOT the way to do it.  I should be living the <em>gutter trash life</em> if that&#39;s what I wanted. lol.  Damn it!  I&#39;m doing it all wrong, man!!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes.  It certainly seems so.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The People of the World will not allow these scum to continue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...Well, bro.  I hate to say it, but we&#39;ve <em>continued</em> to let it &quot;continue&quot; for how many long decades now since the forming of the Federal Reserve in the United States?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it is just a matter of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s been quite a long time already.  We even had three HUGE buildings and 3,000 people murdered right in front of our faces on national television (to say nothing about the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DKOh1.png">tens of millions that have been murdered in wars and staged events and false flags throughout history</a>) and we haven&#39;t done <del>shit</del> enough yet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once the word is out to the world about these dirtballs, 7 Billion strong wont be stopped.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What?  Seriously?  I mean...bro...THE WORD IS <em>OUT</em>.  It&#39;s <em>been</em> out.  What - do you think it&#39;s not <em>known</em> that the money changers are the dirt of the planet and are responsible for the majority of the ill and the strife here?  And yet what are we as a populace of plebs doing about it?  What have we done about it?  Nothing (or certainly not enough).</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because we&#39;re not together as <em>one</em>.  We&#39;ve allowed ourselves to be convinced that we&#39;re all separate and different (and better than/less than).  That keeps us divided, and it keeps us from coming together as one and stopping the b.s. like we most definitely would be able to do if we <em>were</em> united.</p>

<p>7 Billion strong are only strong if they&#39;re <em>together</em>.  And we are <em>very</em> not together, man.  We&#39;re apart and have been brought up and indoctrinated this way from birth on this planet.  That&#39;s exactly how TPTB do it, want it, and currently have it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve Zionists cannot stop the truth.</p>

<p>I wish you were right, man.  They&#39;ve been stopping it though - and we the people have been complicit in it - since they came into existence, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The People of the United States <del>cannot be</del> have <em>been</em> stopped.</p>

<p>I wish I hadn&#39;t, but, well...FTFY.  It&#39;s not irreversible, but that&#39;s the way things certainly seem to be currently.</p>

<p>lol.  What?  They/we haven&#39;t yet.  We are so unbelievably divided that I&#39;m actually shocked you or anyone would even try to think that we&#39;re not.</p>

<p>Not sure if you took part in any of the OWS demonstrations (I did), but that entire movement was 1) one of the closest things this country has had since the civil rights marches to really coming together and marching against TPTB, and 2) it got absolutely squashed and ridiculed by so many OF OUR OWN FUCKING CITIZENS.  WTF?  Our own brothers and sisters were <em>against</em> us.  facepalm.  That was a great example of the sheep policing the sheep.</p>

<p>It takes a LOT for A) people to even see the truth of our enslavement to begin with considering how unbelievably brainwashed most of us are, and B) actually DO something about it after we realize that we <em>are</em> as manipulated as we are.</p>

<p>You do yourself a great disservice by thinking anything otherwise.  One of the best paths toward improvement is realizing what areas you have problems in first.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is the Zionists who perpetuate division.</p>

<p>They are most definitely one of the perpetrators - yes.  Why is it that you have made such a big, aggressive deal out of my saying that we ARE divided then when here you are admitting that it actually IS the case in the first place?</p>

<p>Correct.  I agree.  My gf is <em>much</em> more aware now, but only because she&#39;s w/me and I&#39;ve gotten to talking w/her about it a lot more.  Lots of resistance at first.  She&#39;s a lot more aware now though that I&#39;ve shown her so many examples that are simply difficult to deny.</p>

<p>I do have one fighter that I train, but the thing is that I don&#39;t actually consider myself to be or look at myself as a &quot;trainer&quot; per se.  Boxing&#39;s just something I&#39;ve done for a long time and, as a result, I know a LOT about it.</p>

<p>Yeah man.  I was thinking I&#39;d probably have an even greater level of rigor and responsibility in the things I do than is already the case if I were dealing with a similar situation.  As it stands right now, Alzheimer&#39;s runs <em>suuuuper</em> deep in my family and, even though it might just be me being paranoid, I swear I can already feel myself getting more forgetful.  It is what it is though, so as a result, I&#39;ve just made it a point to definitely jot down anything that&#39;s important or that I don&#39;t want to forget or that I have to do, etc, because I know there&#39;s a pretty good chance that I&#39;m going to forget about it if I don&#39;t have an external reminder.</p>

<p>Also, when driving, I use the GPS a <em>lot</em>.  I&#39;ve always had a not great sense of direction, so I tend not to take directions for granted...ever really.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>sometimes i&#39;ll forget why i&#39;m going wherever, then how to get there, then what road i&#39;m on and where i&#39;m at, so i&#39;d just go home.</p>

<p>Yeah.  Write shit down, my brother.</p>

<p>&quot;Going to the store to get bread.&quot;</p>

<p>etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if i&#39;m going somewhere new to do something i don&#39;t usually do it can be hell in a hand basket addressed to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regular diligence and responsibility can account for and address a good portion of that.  Trust me, I know.  I forget things ALL the time and go &quot;What the hell was I supposed to do now?&quot;  and then I pull out the little scrap of paper in my pocket, see that it says &quot;get groceries from store&quot; and I go &quot;ahh.  that&#39;s it.  got it.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>oh i&#39;m fired because i overslept my shift by 12 hours? alright, guess i&#39;ll go back to bed</p>

<p>That&#39;s certainly fair to say.</p>

<p>Ha.  What day, bro?  You and I are very kin types.  I&#39;m a scorpio of november - &quot;cancer&#39;s perfect match&quot;, as is said.  My gf&#39;s a cancer, and the saying has quite a lot of validity.</p>

<p>I&#39;m decently familiar w/them.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Didn&#39;t even know what a sigil is.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_(magic">Just found out</a>).  I would imagine that it can or has been used as a sigil, but the symbol itself is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monas_Hieroglyphica">The Hieroglyphic Monad of John Dee</a>.  It&#39;s a symbol that represents the center of wisdom in the universe.</p>

<p>Yes.  Very much so.  I have a degree in Philosophy, and much of my life has been geared toward the investigation of those things that lie hidden underneath the surface.</p>
