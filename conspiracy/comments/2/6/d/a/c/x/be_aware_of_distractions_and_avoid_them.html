        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve seen 3 posts today in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that are nothing but distractions. They are topics designed to be vague. Topics that people disagree about. The three that I saw were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Global warming </li>
<li>Spanking children</li>
<li>Voting (left vs. right)</li>
</ul>

<p>None of these topics presented any conspiracy angles. Just some vague musings designed to distract people from real issues. This is most likely a group coordinating together to do some <a href="http://pastebin.com/irj4Fyd5">forum sliding</a>. But, I always see people get bogged down in these mindless posts. They up vote them. They spent tons of energy debating each other in some useless thread. </p>

<p><strong>It&#39;s all being done to distract you!</strong> </p>

<p>Instead of focusing on Government corruption, lies, scandals and truth, we are being inundated with mindless topics. It&#39;s &quot;forum fodder&quot; to keep you away from the truth. They don&#39;t want you talking about the real issues. They don&#39;t want you to seek the truth. Think of it like television. These topics are the Ancient Aliens and Honey Boo Boo of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. These topics are American Idol and CNN News. </p>

<p>When you see a topic that has no clear conspiracy connection then down vote it and move on. Don&#39;t comment. Don&#39;t argue with shills. Don&#39;t waste your time making posts. Just move on to more important topics. Remember: </p>

<p><strong>This isn&#39;t <a href="/r/controversy">/r/controversy</a> or <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> it&#39;s <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>!</strong></p>

<p>EDIT 1: It&#39;s also interesting to me that 30% of the people in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> would downvote this post. Currently there are 156 upvotes 64 downvotes. Who&#39;s downvoting and why? Apparently, there are some people here who don&#39;t want you to be aware of distractions. I didn&#39;t realize the ratio of shills and disinformation agents was so high. There should be a post like this sticky&#39;ed at the top of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to make readers aware of what&#39;s going on. These disinformation agents don&#39;t want you seeking the truth. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfd0_7BcU-0">Go back to bed America...</a></p>

<p>EDIT 2: This thread has been cross-posted over on <a href="/r/conspiritard">/r/conspiritard</a> now so expect the distractions and off topic comments to get worse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the social issue is about gay people wanting equal rights and distraction has nothing to do with their desire for equality. I also think OP thinks we should avoid global warming topics because they don&#39;t care for that topic, who are they?, who an I? Why should we follow them? Why should anyone follow me? I don&#39;t mind people being gay but I don&#39;t like someone trying to hurt the planet due to their agenda, I do think bankers are evil but I don&#39;t ignore that people are slaves to the bankers or my gay friends are discriminated against.</p>

<p>The people in the LaTrobe valley of Vic in AU have the highest rate of cancer in the state, why is that?, it has nothing to do with gay folk.The environment can cause cancer due to coal, but you know OP said we&#39;re shills if we have the audacity to mention anything they don&#39;t approve of.I would say social issues are used to divide humans but that doesn&#39;t make it humans fault.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anything can be a distraction topic. I feel like this world is getting to a point where the powers that be have it how they like, and they aren&#39;t going to let up. Think you can change it by voting? Think about all the hoops someone has to jump through in order to hold office. The amount of funding required, no average joe could swing that. SO they create PACs, and those are shadowy funds from god knows who, making the candidate beholden to the money. </p>

<p>The only real topics that aren&#39;t truly distractionary, are topics about what corporations / banks are robbing the world through backroom deals and shady practices, what government officials are greenlighting for use in the war against humanity, and what people can actually do to make a difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems to me, in addition to what you&#39;ve mentioned, there is too much talk. I see all kinds of posts informing me about what I already know, and most of us here, already know.
Now, I do realize there are those that have not been exposed to this, and are just waking up, so it&#39;s great for them. Keep it coming...</p>

<p>However, what I don&#39;t see much, is options and solutions being discussed nearly as much as you would think they should be.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure TPTB are absolutely fine with this. &quot;Oh look they&#39;re wastin&#39; time and energy talking &#39;bout &quot;X&quot; again&quot;, &quot;Ha that&#39;ll keep &#39;em busy for a while&quot; or something to that effect.</p>

<p>This is what I call &quot;the Noize&quot;, the incessant re-hashing of both real and imagined crap.
But I also see no clear movement to actually DO anything, I am sure there are plenty that are, and even more that want to do something to make things change, but don&#39;t have a clue on where or how to start.</p>

<p>The Noize is also all the flak and stuff that get&#39;s thrown into the mix anytime someone even gets close to trying to getting things moving.
Then people are again distracted, and drawn back to the discussion, good &#39;ol rule 34 mixed with ADD and ADHD types is a win for the bad guys every time.</p>

<p>I feel frustrated, for myself and for others, that want to break the cycles and get moving on the path.</p>

<p>But to talk openly here is bad too, so what is there to do?
Anyone got a better way?</p>

<p>Maybe things are moving along fine maybe I am impatient, but something&#39;s gotta give...<br/>
I am sure some of you feel this way too, especially the ones who have been awake longer.</p>

<p>Anything that comes from the Media, whichever type that may be, is suspect. period. But if we spend all of our energy discussing every little thing that hits the radar...    <em>Ya Know?</em></p>

<p>We know what the problems are, so we should focus on the what some solutions should be. Instead of &quot;discussing&quot; the symptoms so much. Put that energy into forming and forging solutions/options instead.</p>

<p>Sorry for the Rant, just getting frustrated with all the cyclic discussions that don&#39;t seem to lead out of the problems, just deeper into the distracting minutia of what we <em>(a lot of us)</em> may already know. </p>

<p>Funny, I was having a discussion with someone regarding conspiracy topics, and trying to help them learn and understand, when they said, &quot;So, what are you going to do with all this awareness and knowledge?&quot;</p>

<p><em>(I&#39;ll be honest, I probably don&#39;t know half of what some of you do, if not less)</em></p>

<p>and I stopped... I realized, I didn&#39;t really know what to do, I certainly knew what was wrong, but not how I was going to make any difference. Now add that to my already growing frustration.</p>

<p>Sound familiar to any of you? Knowledge is not Wisdom, that comes through applying knowledge through work. This all comes at a price.</p>

<p>So what is it worth? To know what&#39;s wrong and not to be able to fix it. 
I am good at discerning patterns in things and events, I read emotions and body language really well. That&#39;s why I say that something&#39;s gotta give. However I cannot say if that is going to manifest in a good way or not. And currently, probability is NOT in our favor.</p>

<p>Peace and thx for taking the time to read this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sir, have hit it on the nose. I think it&#39;s coming to a head. There is a huge amount of tension on the public, in all countries. As an american, I know I have it good compared to much of the world. But I&#39;m struggling. I&#39;ve had to work temp agency jobs for the last 4 years, usually two jobs at a time, barely getting by. I don&#39;t have a college education, because I saw it as an empty  promise for an unforeseeable future. How people are shackled by their debts, without knowing they will have work. The things you own end up owning you. </p>

<p>My story isn&#39;t one of woe, not one of sympathy, but one of hope. One of knowing I am not the only one out there, working this hard, feeling this pressure. I have hope that humanity will react. That we will rise past this pathetic era of war, lies, and greed. Some day we will wake up to a new world. Stay calm, stay positive, and try to influence good, not just for yourself, but for all. </p>

<p>World Cup. 
Olympics. 
Local sports teams. 
Regional sports teams. 
National sports teams. </p>

<p>You go to work and the first thing you are asked by your colleagues, &quot;Did you see the game?&quot; </p>

<p>Meet someone and after you have talked about work you move on to sports. </p>

<p>You say that you don&#39;t care much for sports and you get treated like a pariah. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO - A Shill&#39;s job is to keep the pot stirring, and as long as it&#39;s stirring there is less real action being taken, so they may be coming from both sides of the argument. It&#39;s helps to dissuade people from taking action or lead them down the wrong paths. </p>

<p>Some may be so confused, that they&#39;re not even sure &quot;X&quot; topic is really even a &quot;thing&quot;.</p>

<p>People try to tell others,  &quot;Don&#39;t feed the Trolls/Shills&quot; or whatever and guess what, they still do. Which leads me to believe maybe they are part of the distraction, or too OCD for their own good.   =)</p>

<p>I say this because I&#39;ve noticed other subreddits over the past year becoming gated by mods and shills, most likely government saboteurs attempting to censor and derail serious discussion, along with this, these shills propagate obvious pro establishment &quot;government&quot; propaganda in the subreddits they gate, ie r/Canada.</p>

<p>The problem with that is different people see different issues as the &quot;real issues&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s &quot;forum fodder&quot; to keep you away from the truth.</p>

<p>I would call it filler, just like a fluff article done by a 24/7 news station.  Sometimes there is nothing new to talk about  and to keep the sub full of fresh posts you will see these filler posts from time to time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Voting could be relevant, however I don&#39;t know the post you&#39;re referring to and it is easy for me to imagine a useless conversation about that topic. The other two don&#39;t really belong here, I agree. </p>

<p>re: your downvotes. There is some vote fuzzing that happens in proportion to how many votes the post earns. If its at under half a dozen, you&#39;ll only see one or two fake votes. These come in pairs, so that you won&#39;t know how many of the votes are real. Ex: If a post has 8 up and 2 down, it could actually be 6 real votes up and 0 down. Or 7 up and 1 down. But when you get into triple digits or more, it happens even more. Some of the downvotes are from this mechanism, but we will never know how many. </p>

<p>As far as bullshit topics: some are from conspiritard, some probably are actual shills, and a lot are just dumb/crazy people. It only makes sense that fringe topics would attract the crazies. Downvote them and leave a short comment about why a link or post is useless and move on. That&#39;s how I try to do it. </p>

<p>You&#39;re seriously falling for the left/right puppet show of politics? Please. </p>

<p>The &quot;liberals&quot; and &quot;conservatives&quot; both work for the same side. It&#39;s designed to distract you and keep you fighting. While you&#39;re busy wasting your energy, the bankers are taking over the world. This is EXACTLY the type of thing I warned about in my post. </p>
