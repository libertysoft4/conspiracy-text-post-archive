        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Mental illnesses are becoming more and more subjective and vague. This is dangerous. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/04/09/a-form-of-gun-confiscation-has-reportedly-begun-in-new-york-state-heres-the-justification-being-used/">&quot;New York’s new gun law — that has a provision apparently mandating confiscation of weapons and permits if someone has been prescribed psychotropic drugs.&quot;</a></p>

<p>With a country being ever-so-dependent on these drugs, I think it&#39;s safe to assume this was the plan all along. They can&#39;t outright negate  the 2nd amendment, instead they&#39;ll get you hopped up on drugs based on ridiculous assumptions like ADHD <a href="http://intellihub.com/10000-toddlers-medicated-adhd/">(10,000 TODDLERS medicated for ADHD - 10,000 future adults that won&#39;t have access to the 2nd amendment because they were &quot;diagnosed&quot; with ADHD while still in diapers)</a>, now you can&#39;t buy a weapon for self-defense anymore. How convenient is that? This is not a plan to ban weapons, it&#39;s a plan to keep you from buying one. It&#39;s a win/win. You&#39;ll be a zombie on meds for asinine reasons and they can claim that the gun grab agenda doesn&#39;t exist since guns will still be freely available but the conditions to buy one will only be revealed at the time of purchase. &quot;Your background check came back with information about you taking meds, so no gun for you&quot;. Hook, line, and sinker.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The NY SAFE Act is designed to remove firearms from those who seek to do harm to themselves or others. This means keeping the minority of individuals with serious mental illness who may be dangerous away from access to firearms. This law should not dissuade any individual from seeking mental health services they need.</p>

<p>If a legitimately disturbed person wants to harm himself or others, he will fucking do it. Access to a gun won&#39;t change that. &quot;It makes it easier&quot;. You&#39;re sane, they&#39;re not, they don&#39;t care how it gets done as long as it gets done. A mentally disturbed individual won&#39;t rationalize about the positives and negatives of a knife vs a gun. He wants blood regardless.</p>

<p><em>In the Soviet Union, a systematic political abuse of psychiatry took place and was based on the interpretation of political dissent as a psychiatric problem.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Classification of the victims</p>

<p>Upon analysis of over 200 well-authenticated cases covering the period 1962–1976, Sidney Bloch and Peter Reddaway developed a classification of the victims of Soviet psychiatric abuse. They were classified as:</p>

<ol>
<li>advocates of human rights or democratization;</li>
<li>nationalists;</li>
<li>would-be emigrants;</li>
<li>religious believers;</li>
<li>citizens inconvenient to the authorities.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>It can be empirically proven that I am  not a paranoid person as it probably can be proven about  others here.</p>

<p>But on the other hand the decisions by those at the very top are clearly psychopathic.</p>

<p>Endless war, universal spying and the criminal banking system come to mind.</p>

<p>Along with these psychotic results we have all of our largest systems acting likewise,  since the predators among us reward those of their own kind.</p>

<p>A system is in place where only someone who has no conscience  about  his fellow man can thrive.</p>

<p>We here are accused pejoratively of merely observing this situation and speaking of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Based on the information I posted above your comment, I think the rationale that will follow is: conspiracy theorist - mentally ill - prohibited from purchasing a firearm. Same goes for those other 4 reasons and I&#39;m sure government can come up with far more than 5 reasons to keep people from becoming &quot;a problem&quot; with a gun pointed at them, the real psychopaths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The more recent ones yes. I think the point I was trying to make is that the mental illness rhetoric will only escalate even for the flimsiest reasons and laws for this quickly follow.</p>

<p><em>In a study released this year that evaluated the characteristics of 37 high profile school shootings from 1987 onward, it was found that the majority of offenders struggled with the same kinds of personal problems. Social marginalization and issues at home or work were found in all cases. Feelings of chronic rejection were common and categorized as feelings of being “bullied, threatened, or injured.” Also, it is worth noting that a significant percentage of shooters felt that they had “failed in developing their manhood.” As per the YouTube video submitted by Elliot Rodger prior to the Santa Barbara shooting, feelings of masculine or sexual inadequacy were significant.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://guardianlv.com/2014/05/mental-illness-or-gun-control-mass-shootings-and-risk-assessment/">http://guardianlv.com/2014/05/mental-illness-or-gun-control-mass-shootings-and-risk-assessment/</a></p>

<p>Personal problems or social marginalization, which are a majority, are a far cry from mentally ill. Everyone has some kind of personal problem, not everyone kill people over it. They have to be labelled mentally ill first. Sane people going on shooting sprees? That&#39;s just crazy!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stereotyping is not the point, a cause or deterrent. It&#39;s a label used to manipulate people and marginalize them. If a certified person claims you are mentally unfit, they can have numerous things done to you, prescribed to you and accuse you of something you did due to this label.

What I have been saying is that most, if not all, of the <strong>arguments or justifications</strong> used to suspend second amendment rights due to mental illness are likely wrong.

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s bigger than that.

Is that good? I don&#39;t know. What if he/she gets therapy and has a family 15 years on? Can he no longer have a weapon to protect his wife and children?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting points you are making. Never thought about it that way. As of now, the HIPPA law protects you from having to divulge that type of history. That is currently being tried in congress to be bypassed for gun purchases. This has to be defeated!!!</p>

<p>As for the background checks they do, they are not that informative. It takes all of 10 minutes over a phone. Pretty much just checking the FBI database to verify you&#39;re not a criminal or wanted. As long as you don&#39;t put down on the form that you took those drugs, no one will ever know</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In our conversation with lawyer Jim Tresmond, we learned that this client, who <strong>has never had a problem with the law</strong> — <strong>no criminal record and or violent incidents on record</strong> — did have a <strong>temporary, short term health issue that required medication</strong>. But how were his client’s private medical information accessed by the government? This appears to be a violation of HIPAA and Health Information Privacy policies at HHS.gov. If it is declared a violation, this becomes a civil rights issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are actively looking for people with medical histories and gun permits and clearly violating HIPAA to get this information and sending out these letters for people to turn in their guns, even for a short term health issue which required medication as reported. So it didn&#39;t even need to be a mental illness diagnosis, a prescription for medication was all it took to confiscate this man&#39;s property.</p>
