    <div class="md"><p>I personally favor content relative to Global events as well as philosophical/contentious issues.</p>

<p>I personally feel this subreddit has suffered from quite a lot of Metadrama involving Moderation as it is, and this current Mod team has not warranted such drama to dominate any narrative.</p>

<p>I personally feel this anti-Flytape drama is not only a product of that special subreddit, (that in my eyes, historically only served to encourage people to be disruptive and intolerant of this one <em>in our own cemment sections</em>) but also serves to distract from the overall intent of this place -Discourse.</p>

<p>In short, my suggestion is, instead of arguing and insulting users you disagree with, converse respectfully with ones you do if you can&#39;t with the ones you don&#39;t. There is such a thing as destructive behavior and I feel it is generally frowned upon here, there are plenty of other Subreddits that don&#39;t.</p>

<p>I consider the decision fully justified. Doubly so considering this information.</p>

<p>I do not envy you guys at all. I have about 2<sup>1/5</sup> /3 weeks of moderator experience, and it was a nightmare. Not a comparison, just saying I couldn&#39;t handle a tenth of what you do for even a fraction of the time, in a <em>simulation</em> of the experience.</p>

<p>So your aggression is highly appreciated.</p>
