<p>Iraqi PM Maliki says Saudi, Qatar openly funding ISIS/ISIL &amp; violence in Anbar <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/09/us-iraq-saudi-qatar-idUSBREA2806S20140309">http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/09/us-iraq-saudi-qatar-idUSBREA2806S20140309</a></p>

<p>The money funding Islamic Terrorist groups in Syria flows through Kuwait <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/world/middleeast/private-donors-funds-add-wild-card-to-war-in-syria.html?_r=1&amp;">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/world/middleeast/private-donors-funds-add-wild-card-to-war-in-syria.html?_r=1&amp;</a></p>

<p>I put this up on Reddit - it got a positive response. You can see the comments here.

<p>Why doesn&#39;t the CIA stop arming and funding Islamic terrorist groups? <a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/05/benghazi-libyan-gun-running-cia-cover.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/05/benghazi-libyan-gun-running-cia-cover.html</a></p>

<p>Blowback! U.S. trained ISIS at secret Jordan base <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2014/06/officials-u-s-trained-isis-at-secret-base-in-jordan/">http://www.wnd.com/2014/06/officials-u-s-trained-isis-at-secret-base-in-jordan/</a></p>

<p>N.B. We don&#39;t actually know which terrorist group the 200 or so fighters the CIA trained up in Jordan to fight in Syria, belonged to. Unless somebody has some better info on exactly who they were. (I wouldn&#39;t trust WND to get it right that it was ISIS.)</p>

<p>We also know that Turkey is providing significant material support to ISIS and Al-Nusra from various reports
E.G. this <a href="https://twitter.com/_TurkeyNews/status/478639189970673664/photo/1">https://twitter.com/_TurkeyNews/status/478639189970673664/photo/1</a></p>

<p>And this </p>

<p>PIPES: Turkey’s support for ISIS Islamist terrorists <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/17/pipes-turkeys-support-for-isis/">http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/17/pipes-turkeys-support-for-isis/</a></p>

<p>Lots of important information is left out of the above report about Syria and Turkey which is included in the link below (it is from the Washington Times after all)</p>

<p>Syria update - the Islamic Extremists are losing the war, so Saudi Arabia wants to supply heavy weapons <a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/04/syria-update-islamic-extremists-are.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/04/syria-update-islamic-extremists-are.html</a></p>

<p>The results of the US backed funding of Islamic Extremist terrorist groups and the US invasion of Iraq</p>

<p>Iraq has been a bloodbath for a decade, it&#39;s economy and infrastructure have been ruined. Over 500,000 Iraqi&#39;s have died during the US occupation, millions have been displaced. Numerous major birth defects and other illnesses are being reported due to the US using depleted uranium in Fallujah. The US also used white phosphorus, which is banned as a chemical weapon under the Geneva convention.
N.B. Iraq was never &quot;pacified&quot; by a troop surge as the Neocons claim. The Sunni&#39;s were bribed with billions of US tax dollars to keep quiet for a while - but this bribe money has now dried up.</p>

<p>The CIA engineered civil war in Libya, in support of Islamic Extremists from Benghazi, has turned Libya into a bloodbath with various armed militias shooting each other. It&#39;s economy and infrastructure also lie in ruins.</p>

<p>The CIA engineered Syrian civil war has turned Syria into a bloodbath with 140,000 (on both sides) killed. Syria&#39;s economy and infrastructure also lie in ruins. Millions have been displaced and have fled as refugees.
The Islamic Extremists (which comprise almost all of the actively fighting &quot;rebels&quot;) have been losing the war against Assad in Syria so they have now turned their attention back to Iraq with some major gains by ISIS including taking over $400m from Iraqi banks (we await further developments).</p>

<p>The US war against Pakistan has killed hundreds of innocent civilians with drone strikes including 170 children.</p>

<p>The civil war in Yemen where the US has used cruise missiles, cluster bombs and drone strikes in support of a corrupt dictator has turned Yemen into a bloodbath.</p>

<p>Boku Haram which is covertly funded and armed by the US proxy Saudi Arabia, via islamic extremists in Libya is murdering christians in Nigeria.</p>

<p>Mali&#39;s legitimate government was overthrown in a joint US &amp; French military coup in 2012 to be replaced by a puppet President trained by the US at military bases in the US.</p>

<p>The Afghan poppy crop which had been reduced by 90% with the Taleban&#39;s ban in 2000 is now greater than ever. More Afghans are now subject to drugs warlords (of which Karzai &amp; his brother are both major ones). Afghanistan remains a bloodbath and a hot civil war.</p>

<p>A semi stable government in Somalia was overthrown by Ethiopia in a US backed coup. Somalia is in chaos, with elements of this chaos murdering innocent civilians in Kenya.</p>

<p>More than 200 million more people now support Islamic Extremism than they did in 2005.</p>

<p>Ukraine has been turned into a civil war zone by a US engineered illegal Coup D&#39;Etat in Kiev. Ukraine is joining Iraq, Syria and Libya in the utter misery, violence, death and poverty that comes with US &quot;liberation&quot;.</p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t be quite so bad, if the nett result of all this US mega stupidity wasn&#39;t the ruining of the US economy and the very dramatic quickening of the end of the petrodollar system and the end of American hegemony to hand over the reins of power to a SE Asia dominated world, centered on China - with Russia, the Brics, Africa and South America as allies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s 2 types of enemy:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Ideological - nations who&#39;s culture is so different and messed up that we could never &#39;have a beer with them&#39;.</p></li>
<li><p>Economically - nations that refuse to do business with us in a way that we would like</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Saudi Arabia is ideologically our enemy but economically our friend. We despise them because they stone people to death, cut hands off and flog people for being gay or committing blasphemy. We love them because they sell us oil and buy our shit and that relationship also means we protect them in the Middle East.</p>
