<p>Background:</p>

<p>Booz Allen Hamilton is owned by the Carlyle Group. The Carlyle Group are a private equity fund that invests in lots of companies that make money out of the business of war - arms companies, private spy contractors etc.</p>

<p>Significant board members, associates and &quot;consultants&quot; of the Carlyle Group include the Bush&#39;s and a who&#39;s who of ex US government war hawks for the last 40 years.</p>

<p>Significant investors in the Carlyle group include the House of Saud and the Bin Laden Family.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia wants a very high oil price - it sells lots of oil.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia&#39;s foreign policy is directed at increasing the price of oil. Mostly this is done by destabilizing and starting conflicts and wars in, other countries that have oil (or are major distribution routes).</p>

<p>This is done in two main ways:-</p>

<p>By funding, arming and recruiting Islamic Extremist terrorists to attack other countries</p>

<p>By bribing the American government to conduct policy that is in the interests of Saudi Arabia and not in the interests of America.</p>

<p>Having a high oil price is directly against the interests of America and it&#39;s main export market - Europe. Every $1 rise in the price of a barrel of oil makes everyone in America, Europe and over 99% of the rest of the world poorer (except for the major owners &amp; CEO&#39;s of oil companies and oil assets).</p>

<p>Some of the evidence for the involvement of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States in funding, arming, recruiting and supporting Islamic terrorism:-</p>

<p>If the NSA is actually fighting terrorism why haven&#39;t they stopped Saudi Arabia, Qatar &amp; Kuwait funding Islamic terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Nusra? <a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/06/if-nsa-is-actually-fighting-terrorism.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/06/if-nsa-is-actually-fighting-terrorism.html</a></p>

<p>Saudi Royal Family and Saudi government involvement in 9/11 <a href="http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/06/saudi-royal-family-and-saudi-government.html">http://ian56.blogspot.com/2014/06/saudi-royal-family-and-saudi-government.html</a></p>

<p>It is also in the interests of the Carlyle Group, in order to boost their profits, that there is more war, conflict and Islamic terrorism:-</p>

<p>Booz Allen Hamilton and the Carlyle Group: A tale of high level corruption in both parties</p>

<p>The Details of Booz Allen Hamilton, Carlyle and some of the significant players</p>

<p>Lost in the Edward Snowden debate is a critical look at his former employer, the company doing the spying on Americans in the first place: Booz Allen Hamilton.</p>

<p>Booz Allen Hamilton is a government contractor, with 99% of its revenue coming from the US government. Not only does it receive money from the NSA, but also the US Army, US Navy, US Air Force, US Marine Corps, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and ... the IRS. In addition, Booz Allen is heavily connected to the CIA.</p>

<p>Among the individuals involved in running the company, we have:</p>

<p>James Clapper - current Director of National Intelligence (DNI), head of NSA, the man who lied to Congress about the fact that NSA is actively spying on Americans, is a former executive</p>

<p>Mike McConnell - a current executive of the company, had Clapper&#39;s job (DNI) during George W. Bush&#39;s administration (keep it in the family, eh?) -- he worked for Booz Allen before Bush, then worked for Bush, then back to Booz Allen after Bush</p>

<p>James Woolsey - former CIA Director, current executive (see Jan Helfeld&#39;s interview of Mr. Woolsey where it becomes clear that Woolsey has no interest in discussing principles, only war)</p>

<p>Melissa Hathaway - former executive, also worked for McConnell during the Bush administration</p>

<p>Ian Brzezinski - former executive, son of Zbigniew Brzezinski, co-founder of the Trilateral Commission with David Rockefeller, central figure in the NWO crowd, and mastermind of Operation Cyclone</p>

<p>Dov Zakheim - this character is ... unbelievable:</p>

<p>1993 - His company, System Planning Corporation, had a subsidiary called Tridata Corporation, which was the company that &quot;oversaw&quot; the investigation of the 1993 WTC bombing</p>

<p>2000 - Part of the neocon Project for a New American Century, he is co-author of &quot;Rebuilding America&#39;s Defenses,&quot; in which he is credited with the infamous line, &quot;... some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor.&quot;</p>

<p>2001 - He is appointed Comptroller of the Pentagon, in which $2.3 trillion promptly goes &quot;missing&quot;</p>

<p>2001 - Attack on 9/11 occurs; some people are suspicious of his connections, since his company, SPC, in involved in flight systems capable of remote controlling aircraft, and because he was the guy who leased 32 Boeing 767 aircraft to McDill Air Force Base (2 of the 9/11 aircraft were 767&#39;s), and McDill is close to Elgin AFB, which was the location that was to be used if Operation Northwoods had gone live</p>

<p>2004 - Goes to work for Booz Allen Hamilton.</p>

<p>2012 - Advisor on Middle East policy for Mitt Romney campaign (gee ... ya think Romney would have gone to war in the Middle East???)</p>

<p>Booz Allen Hamilton is owned by the Carlyle Group.</p>

<p>One of the big investors in the Carlyle Group was the Bin Laden family in Saudi Arabia. Yeah ... THAT Bin Laden family. And instrumental in being the &quot;go between&quot; for Carlyle/Bin Laden was a guy by the name of George H. W. Bush. Maybe you&#39;ve heard of him? The House of Saud are also big investors in the Carlyle Group.</p>

<p>The CEO of the Carlyle Group (remember, they OWN Booz Allen Hamilton) is Frank Carlucci. Mr. Carlucci has quite a resume:</p>

<p>Nixon Administration - Director of the Office for Economic Opportunity (the &quot;War on Poverty&quot; -- and a great place to decide who gets government contracts)</p>

<p>Carter Administration - Deputy Director of the CIA</p>

<p>Reagan Administration - National Security Advisor and Secretary of Defense (Donald Rumsfeld is Carlucci&#39;s protege)</p>

<p>He is or has been with the Project for a New American Century and a member of the Board of Trustees for the RAND Corporation, a CIA front that develops policies that the Military Industrial Complex then carries out.</p>

<p>You want a NWO guy? Carlucci is your man. And CEO of Carlyle Group, owner of Booz Allen Hamilton, spying on YOU.</p>

<p>At RAND, his specialty was Middle East policy. What do you know? That was also the specialty of Graham Fuller, CIA guy who was the father-in-law of Ruslan Tsarni, uncle of Tamarlan Tsarnev, suspected Boston bomber.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Boston bombing and Tamarlan Tsarnaev, he had a couple of trips to Russia that made the news. But what did not make the news (in America, but it did in Russia) is that he went there for &quot;training&quot; that was funded by the Jamestown Foundation. And what do you know? The Jamestown Foundation (CIA front) has among its past board members none other than Dick Cheney and Marcia Carlucci, wife of Frank Carlucci.</p>

<p>Given all their connections and government contracts, here&#39;s an interesting question: Booz Allen Hamilton has not only been involved in spying via the NSA, but they have also received no-bid contracts from the IRS. What do they know about the American people via the IRS? Now, one of the things you will start to see if you look around at some of the big corporations these days is that many of them are involved in what they call &quot;corporate citizenship&quot; or something similar. What this means at the surface level is they are being &quot;good citizens&quot; by donating to charity. But when you go beyond the surface, you will see something else going on. Booz Allen Hamilton donates money to the Clinton Global Initiative. The CGI is a part of the Clinton Foundation (yeah, THAT Clinton).</p>

<p>The Clinton Foundation has been implicated in bribery on an international level. Clinton gave himself a special little privilege while president wherein he exempted the William Jefferson Clinton Foundation from the normal rules of disclosure regarding publicly listing who its contributors were. It&#39;s a secret foundation. And it has over $200 million in assets now. And is alleged to be used as a way to funnel black money from corrupt governments around the world for behind-the-scenes deals like special oil contracts, arms dealing, US government foreign aid deals, whatever.</p>

<p>So folks, what you are not being told in the media about Edward Snowden&#39;s former company is that it is not only spying on you, but it is probably checking out your tax returns, too, and also receiving some of your tax money in government contracts, which it then funnels to CIA-connected/Military Industrial Complex-connected/NWO-connected individuals and organizations.</p>

<p>Something like this: Your tax money (taken from you by force) -&gt; IRS -&gt; Booz Allen Hamilton -&gt; Clinton Foundation -&gt; foreign bribes -&gt; more contracts for the Military Industrial Complex -&gt; more spending by foreign governments -&gt; more foreign aid from the US government -&gt; more US government spending -&gt; more taxes needed -&gt; more taxes from YOU. Oh ... and they are spying on you, too. But Edward Snowden ... yeah HE is the bad guy here. Uh huh ... move along ... nothing to see here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have my own blog which now has over 800 articles on Foreign Policy, economics, politics, civil rights and corruption. </p>

<p>This is my blog <a href="http://www.ian56.blogspot.com/">http://www.ian56.blogspot.com/</a></p>

<p>The vast majority of the 800 articles are still very relevant today (some of the earlier articles were originally written 10 or 12 years ago now - the relevant pieces were copied to this blog).</p>

<p>I specialize on building a compendium of information on a topic from multiple sources over a period of time and then putting it together in a blog post. </p>

<p>These were my recent efforts on Ukraine:- </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Booz disclosures are interesting however i think it is more important to emphasize that the Bush family has directly gotten money from Saudis for decades.</p>

<p>Its hard to NOT say they have been given money to betray the interests of the united ststes. That&#39;s literal treason.</p>

<p>Its why the Bush&#39;s are a wealthy family today. Every one of their many business failures were bailed out by Saudis.</p>

<p>Micheal Moore&#39;s movie  &quot;Fahrenhiet 911&quot; documented this formerly hidden relationship very well including a literal video of a young George W. Bush talking about the monetary worth of him having access to his President dad while he was in office and before G W.  Was president.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Start with the simple concept of supply and demand and go from there. If KSA actually wanted to raise the price of oil, then they wouldn&#39;t be fighting with Iran about annual production projections each year at OPEC. The reality is that KSA has been pumped more oil than even their own advisors are comfortable with for decades now... to keep the price down, not up. It&#39;s basic supply and demand. The US pushes KSA to produce as much oil as possable to hurt Iran.. Iran is the one who benefits from higher oil prices.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US benefits from high oil / gas prices too.  Fracking isn&#39;t economically sound unless the price is high because it costs so much to get the energy.  Also, the more energy purchased, in dollars, helps to float the economy.  Everybody wants higher prices, except the people who gotta pay, you and I</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please dont say &quot;the us&quot;.</p>

<p>It isnt the us.</p>

<p>Its the bush texas saudi oil alliance.</p>

<p>Remember the saudis are heavily invested and own huge oil leases in the usa.</p>

<p>The bush/saudis also purchased nearly all the corn ethanol fields in the midwest after bush bankrupted the us corn ethanol farmers by &quot;temporarily&quot; removing the requirement that all gas have 10% ethanol after 911 (becuase 911). Then after the saudis bought up the bankrupted fields and suddenly empty new ethanol refineries, g w bush in his last act in office reinstated the 10% requirement &quot;for the enivironment&quot; (RRRIIIGGGHTT)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The realm of pumping choices they have is becuade they have shut down other  producers.</p>

<p>It wouldnt be possible if not for that.</p>

<p>Besides you really dont know how much of what you say is just propaganda. How do you really know the us pressures the saudis to raise production?</p>

<p>Also remember the sauids were financially nearly broke in the 90&#39;s . There were books being written about their imminent fall when oil was $30 a barrel . One was called &quot;the fall of the house of saud&quot; if i remember correctly. They HAD to pump more secretly just to keep the cadh coming in to stay afloat and much of theor production was secret and done by some members of the family illegally.</p>

<p>The world was flush with oil. Its amazing what the gulf war and oil sanctions on iraq for ten yrs did though. Its almost as of the bushs WANTED saddam to invade kuwait and give them a reason to shutthem down. Which of course explains why the us ambassador told saddam the usa wouldnt care if he invaded kuwait.</p>
