<p>Hey Reddit admin, you guys did a great job totally selling out. You can now pat yourselves on the back and go fuck yourselves. </p>

<p>Edit 1: Just found out about <a href="http://whoaverse.com/v/conspiracy">http://whoaverse.com/v/conspiracy</a> ... going to give that a try for a few days.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2: I am and will be making the following post to some of the main subs i belong to:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>An alternate site for posting info: whoaverse.com/v/conspiracy</strong></p>

<p>Now that Reddit is losing its transparency, I will slowly be moving on to another site, i.e, posting all my links to <a href="http://whoaverse.com/v/conspiracy">whoaverse.com/v/conspiracy</a> ...and splitting my time between here and there. </p>

<p>Just figured that it&#39;s best to start building the content on the other site now that Reddit has obviously decided to go the way of google, turn to the dark side. </p>

<p>I am making this same post to the subReddit that I am most active on just in case others are looking for alternative. </p>

<p>As far as disclaimers go, there are none. I am just a user and not affiliated to the other site. </p>

<p><em>ps. I&#39;m assuming people can make their own subs as well, I just haven&#39;t tried it yet.</em> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My best bet is because the user base is growing. </p>

<p>When a post hits front page, it&#39;s going to stay there longer because more people are constantly logging on throughout the day. So if we had a post without ~500 points, more people are seeing that and then in turn more people are upvoting it, causing it to stay on the front page. </p>

<p>That, plus I&#39;m sure there is some rigging going on</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you might google waybackmachine which archives past history of internet pages. But none of the images will work. There&#39;s probably some archived copies of how reddit used to be elsewhere too if you google around a bit. Basically it used to be much more news and tech oriented, with logical and in-depth discussion. Lately it has turned in to basically a 4chan clone</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People used to put much more thought and care in to their comments. This was a hub for discussion about technology and ideas. Now it&#39;s just a 4chan meme-fest. You can still find strains of the old reddit in certain subreddits, but you really have to search it out. People just used to be much more thoughtful and respectful. Sure there were memes and funny things, but they were the minority of posts. </p>

<p>Now it&#39;s almost completely dominated by memes and smarmy nonsense. <a href="/r/TrueReddit">/r/TrueReddit</a> and <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> remind me the most of the old reddit, but it&#39;s still not the same. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a new site called <a href="http://www.whoaverse.com">www.whoaverse.com</a> and it kind of reminds me how reddit used to be, but it doesn&#39;t have quite the userbase yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like many are checking whoaverse.com out, and that is good to see.  I think Reddit finally turned itself into DiGG, and the people are walking.  I will split time between the two sites for now and see if there is anything I can offer to help make it grow; but one way or another, Reddit is now dead to me.  This vote total obfuscation is the final straw.  </p>

<p>I will poke the corpse on occasion, but really, I&#39;ll be here to take content to a much better place.  Thanks for the heads up on the new site OP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are lots of reasons I have seen given as to why it matters to different people. </p>

<p>To me in particular, if I make a comment and it has a -1 score that doesn&#39;t tell me what kind of traffic it had. Did it only get seen by 1 person who disagreed with it, or did 500 people roll through and have wildly polar opinions about it? </p>

<p>I guess that easy indicator of the amount of interest and attention that I had before was important to me. I don&#39;t collect karma, but I usually want to be at least somewhat useful in the conversation. This was a key metric for determining how useful I am on reddit. </p>
