        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You know I always dismissed posts claiming reddit is turning to shit, we should go elsewhere, etc...</p>

<p>Because I always thought, if each of us puts the effort into upvoting and downvoting and commenting, we can create the community we want.</p>

<p>This new downvote fuzzing bullshit, in my opinion is the last straw. Reddit is no longer viable in my mind, where do I go now?</p>

<p>edit: I will still comment and upvote but it seems we have lost this one people.</p>

<p>edit2: tried to find one comment saying something, anything, positive about the new change in the thread that announced it. I could not find one.</p>

<p>Bought a domain, though, that is the first step, now I have to figure out everything else.</p>

<p>edit3: I have been browsing <a href="http://whoaverse.com">http://whoaverse.com</a> that <a href="/u/fenixrisin">/u/fenixrisin</a> suggested. It has many kinks in it to be remedied, though I am down to start anew and get a couple years, if not more, of quality discourse than the rubbish we have gotten to. Check it out if interested.</p>

<p>edit4: Thank you all for your comments, I greatly appreciate them. I will still visit reddit but over time that will probably dwindle down until I stop entirely. I have been here for two years and its been great while it lasted.</p>

<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>edit5: Figured this was worth posting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now that Reddit is losing its transparency, I will slowly be moving on to another site, i.e, posting all my links to whoaverse.com/v/conspiracy ...and splitting my time between here and there.</p>

<p>Just figured that it&#39;s best to start building the content on the other site now that Reddit has obviously decided to go the way of google, turn to the dark side.</p>

<p>I am making this same post to the subReddit that I am most active on just in case others are looking for alternative.</p>

<p>As far as disclaimers go, there are none. I am just a user and not affiliated to the other site.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is where the crypto currency algorithms come in. They can define work and credit in a variety of ways.  So without spending two years working on the project and off of the top of my head I would say that upvotes could be defined as work credit to allow posting.  The problem though is that there would be nothing stopping people from simply making a lot of accounts to upvote each other.  The main trick would be to prevent a runaway botnet.  If people could run their own fiefdoms from within the system then that could solve a lot of issues right there as likely there would need to be a starting point of trust to set things in the right direction.  I think that this problem is overall an order of magnitude more complicated because it would need to borrow from all of the latest innovations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are, dare I say it, mentally overboard</p>

<p>reddit originally offered its source code free of charge for other sites to be created and exist</p>

<p>the audience refused to leave because of laziness and complacency</p>

<p>this is not the fault of the elite power base, this is the fault of the audience for not taking action</p>

<p>Reddit was hated among the internets for a strange and text heavy interface when Digg was the big boy but Digg sold out for moneyz and all but the most mental came here (Check the forum posts from digg submissions, I dont even believe that those people even have a human brain, i sound cocky but its true)</p>

<p>Anyways, go and make an alternative. Noone is doing it because the only alternatives for conspiracy related forums are 1) Anti-semitic sites like stormfront, etc 2) Sites that dont allow alternative and creative thought processes ie: If you go against the grain of hive-mind thought, you are banned.</p>

<p>The one good thing about <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is the mods lack of full control over every detail allowing us to supply various alternative thoughts. It is more liberal than other sites too despite the so called shill infestation. For example, a mod here starting with &quot;S&quot; is a transvestite cross dresser which is awesome except for the anti-jewish fervor in her posts which is a shame since I am german and jewish and can see through a lot of the stuff going on here.</p>

<p>There are a lot of interesting things happening on conspiracy every day internally, externally, and from the audience which is why it is so fascinating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;the internets doesnt like strange, text heavy interfaces&quot;</p>

<p>you mean like 4chin?</p>

<p>for the most part I agree, apathy is truly our greatest enemy.</p>

<p>I would wager that the next real forum for open thought will be on some kind of meshnet, whatever form it may take.</p>

<p>anything else will be corrupted eventually, because the network itself is corrupt.</p>

<p>This is why we need to stop faffing about and begging our masters for that wolf in sheeps clothing, &quot;net neutrality&quot;, and we need to stop crying when a corporate owned site like reddit inevitably is subverted to support the powers that be.</p>

<p>Instead we should focus on building real alternatives, the possibilities for this are multiplying fast.</p>

<p>Gui-fi in spain is amazing f.e, some of the ad-hoc networks in less industrialised countries are fucking astounding as well, literally built out of pringles cans and jailbroken routers.</p>

<p>Hell, curry of Noagenda was going on about how you can get a mb/s over the fackin radio waves if you know wat you are doing.</p>

<p>which brings us back to the main problem: apathy.</p>

<p>We have our porn, and our netflix, and amazon. Sometimes I fear that this is all that people want, and all this outrage is simply because Orange is the new fucking Black is buffering too long.</p>

<p>then I look around a bit and I see amazing people doing amazing fucking work the world over, people that truly understand the predicament we are in.</p>

<p>maybe we all just need a swift kick in the tush.</p>

<p>Not a bad idea. You&#39;d have to take that up with the other mods. Though I&#39;m not sure they&#39;d feel compelled or motivated to do so. There&#39;s already a similar alternative in place, whoaverse, with a limited userbase and the predicament of having to start fresh. Then you have the matter of the nearly quarter of a million users we have here already. While I do not like this latest development to say the least, for various reasons, it isn&#39;t necessarily the worst we&#39;ve seen so far. That accomplishment would be the fact the site has become inundated with shills/special interest advocates, corporate and government alike, who use their clout to influence and censor the larger subs (conspiracy aside), a minority of which organize brigades and attacks against our own. Well them, and there useful idiots of course, of which there is no shortage in sight.</p>

<p>Perhaps. One way to look at it, is if we simply give up and leave the sub or site as a whole, rather than standing up for we believe in, then it is essentially mission accomplished for those who have positioned themselves against us.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say <em>we&#39;ve</em> lost so much as the reddit admins have lost, and handed us their failure by proxy.</p>

<p>On the other hand, as mentioned prior, if we simply give up and leave over something as minor (though incredibly shady) as this, and allow those who troll and brigade our sub to take over, we are essentially handing them an even greater victory, and abandoning all other users here  in the process, those dedicated enough to not give up so easily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi! I am currently the only developer of whoaverse and I never actually expected that this many people would be using it. Whoaverse was more of a side project to me, heavily inspired by all the mistakes reddit keeps making (forced default subs and now downvote change). There is currently no private messaging system and no subscriptions, but these are top priorities among other issues that need fixing/implementing. For a full list check here: <a href="https://github.com/whoaverse/whoaverse/issues?state=open">https://github.com/whoaverse/whoaverse/issues?state=open</a></p>

<p>Could whoaverse replace reddit? In current state, hell no. Being a poor student, I could in no way afford to pay for the servers needed to run this on such a large scale, but there is a chance that whoaverse becomes a foundation (like Wikipedia) if enough people are interested.</p>

<p>Currently, the only better thing whoaverse offers is genuine account deletion feature which actually deletes all data you left on whoaverse if you ever decide to delete your account. Unlike reddit where all your comments and posts remain intact, whoaverse actually overwrites every comment and post with &quot;deleted&quot; if you delete your account and then proceeds to remove your username and encrypted password from the database.</p>

<p>Whoaverse is in very early alpha so I suggest you don&#39;t move to whoaverse unless you can handle some downtime, bugs or missing features :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>we need a replacement/improvement to reddit. here&#39;s what i&#39;ve been thinking about it: </p>

<p>I believe that the community should be pay to participate. Not a large amount, a one-time charge of a dollar or two should be enough to get the desired effect. The idea is to make it fairly painless to join the community and participate, but prohibitive to exert influence through bots and the like. Being banned would actually matter. Users buying accounts would require that moderation would have to be fair and transparent, necessary to a thriving online community in any case. For users that require anonymity, bitcoin could be an option. I think this would encourage a community of thoughtful participation.</p>

<p>You could have the community democratically decide on a few different worthy causes, and then members could choose which one they wanted their money to go to when they signed up. Relatedly, the same process could be applied to any ad revenue the community generated(beyond what was required to pay for hosting/bandwidth). I think this would have a few knock-on benefits, the first being that people would be encourage to use the community more, as they would be aware that their ad-impressions were paying for solar water desalinators in africa or cancer research or whatever, which should make people feel less guilty for redditing the day away. Secondly, by making the community a philanthropic instead of for-profit enterprise, you remove the monetary incentive for corruption. (On the organization side, at least. People looking to drive traffic will still have plenty of incentive to do so.)</p>

<p>Lastly, and most nebulously, I think that making philanthropy a part of the bedrock of the community would really help to foster a culture that feels empowered to effect positive change in the world. To my mind, the aspect of reddit that I find most unpleasant is the constant defeatism and apathy. While I would love to be a member of content aggregation/discussion community that made the world a better place just through its use as an entertainment outlet, what I really hunger for is a community and platform that could come up with some novel means of improving our collective lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like it because sometimes I put far too much emphasis on how many downvotes I get in relation to upvotes. A few times, I have made comments that got tons of downvotes because everyone thought I was wrong, but later more info came out and I turned out to be correct. In the end, I&#39;ve come to realize downvote/upvote ratios mean nothing, and it&#39;s the content of your comments which is important. And nothing has changed in regards to what kind of content you can submit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we are being controlled by an invisible hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see no reason to believe anything has changed in terms of what content people upvote/downvote. Content is subject to the exact same influences they were before the change. People will continue upvoting, and people will continue downvoting. What reason do you have to think that there is now some manipulation going on that wasn&#39;t before?</p>
