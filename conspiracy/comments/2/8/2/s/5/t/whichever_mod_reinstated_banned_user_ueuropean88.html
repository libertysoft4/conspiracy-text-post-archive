        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This user has been re-banned by <a href="/u/mr_dong">/u/mr_dong</a>. I will leave the body of this post intact so that those reading it understand what happened. <strong>END UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>This user was banned several months ago by <a href="/u/quantumcipher">/u/quantumcipher</a> for constantly spamming links to DavidDuke.com and TheDailyStormer.com. Apparently he was asked to stop posting links to those sites, but he refused and was subsequently banned.</p>

<p>Several days ago, one of the mods apparently lifted his ban. Since then, he has gone right back to spamming this sub with links to those exact same websites. Several of them have been upvoted, to the apparent delight of subs like <a href="/r/isconspiracyracist">/r/isconspiracyracist</a> and <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. </p>

<p>He has also posted comments like this one <strong>in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like rats and cockroaches, the Jewish parasite not only feeds off of its host, but also weakens it until it is eventually destroyed. All parasites spread misery and destruction wherever they go - this is fully consistent with the behavior of international Jewry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Link: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/281f44/there_is_no_doubt_none_that_the_mission_of_the/ci6g271">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/281f44/there_is_no_doubt_none_that_the_mission_of_the/ci6g271</a></p>

<p><strong>MY QUESTION:</strong> Do we want our sub represented by people who link to literal neo-nazi and KKK websites and who spew such vile hate speech? Apparently one of our mods does, because otherwise why would he unban this user and allow him to go right back to doing what got him banned in the first place.</p>

<p>Also, here are some snippets from <a href="/u/European88">/u/European88</a>&#39;s posting history, which can be viewed here <a href="/u/European88">/u/European88</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Europe has had enough of international Jewry and we&#39;re fully prepared to smite the parasite for the millionth time. There was no &quot;holocaust&quot;, but there WILL be and you serpentine kikes richly deserve one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AND</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kikes are parasites, plain and simple. I wouldn&#39;t refer to them as people - they are no better than fleas or ticks. Here in Europe, everyone hates Jews, but brainwashed Muricans are far too stupid to see past their Zionist propaganda. Thankfully, the days of Jewish power are coming to an end as nationalism rises in Europe, the European Jewnion crumbles, and the US stops being Israel&#39;s lapdog. There was no &quot;holocaust&quot;, but there should have been - and there WILL be. Groups like Golden Dawn, Jobbik, National Front, and other &quot;extremists&quot; are surging all over Europe and the greedy, hook-nosed kikes know that their days are numbered. There is simply no place for kikes, niggers, gypsies, or other subhuman mud in Europe. If Muricans want to get fucked up the ass by Jamal and Carlos, they can feel free to do so while us Europeans take back our continent from the Jews and the savages that the Jews allowed in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AND</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, let me guess: you&#39;re all brainwashed Muricans who mindlessly believe whatever Zionist propaganda your kike overlords feed you, right? Here in Europe, everyone hates Jews. Groups like Golden Dawn, Jobbik, National Front, and other &quot;extremists&quot; are surging all over Europe and the greedy, hook-nosed kikes know that their days here are numbered. Yet you retarded Muricans CONTINUE to mindlessly defend these parasitic yid cockroaches no matter what. Have fun getting overrun by niggers and spics while us Europeans take back our continent from the subhuman hordes. We won&#39;t miss you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AND</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you let these savage subhuman beasts run a country, this is what happens. Niggers are a plague upon humanity and need to be exterminated. Thankfully, Ebola is doing some good for the world right now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>If I get banned for posting this, then it will send a pretty clear message that blatant racism and anti-semitism is supported by the mods of this sub.</strong></p>

However we all make mistakes and i&#39;m sure the mod who lifted the ban did so as a second chance opportunity and not read the latest comments by <a href="/u/European88">/u/European88</a>, many of which are venomous and racially charged. </p>

<p>The ban has been re-issued and will remain in place. </p>

<p>He is still here. That&#39;s the issue. One of the mods lifted his ban.</p>

<p><a href="/u/Antiochus88">/u/Antiochus88</a>, for example, is 99.9% sure to be an anti-Semite. But he doesn&#39;t post links to literal neo-nazi blogs or the websites of former KKK leaders and he doesn&#39;t throw around ethnic slurs like they are going out of style. So I see no reason why he would be banned. <a href="/u/european88">/u/european88</a> crosses all of those lines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hell it seems there are a SHIT ton of users in this subreddit that are absolute shills and disruptive shit heads that should get the absolute heave ho...and yet nothing seems to get done.</p>

<p>No one really seems to get banned too often if at all in this sub.</p>

<p>It&#39;s lame really because there have been quite a few other alternative conspiracy subreddits that have popped up and I know at least a couple of them have NO problem with banning you in a heart beat if you prove to be an asswipe.  This is a <em>good</em> thing since it seems this particular sub has had such a huge influx of shills - but those other subs simply haven&#39;t really caught on, and there&#39;s not a lot of flow/people visiting them, etc.  As such, this sub seems to remain the more heavily populated conspiracy sub, yet THIS is the very one that has amongst the shittiest, most laissez faire type of moderating in terms of letting negative behavior persist.</p>

<p>WTF?</p>

<p>To be sure, I think some of the mods here seem to be pretty cool.  I just also think that a lot more people should get the ban hammer dropped on them than is the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you will get banned. That would be ridiculous. </p>

<p>Free speech is important... But overt racism is not something that we should choose to allow to flood this community. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a tough call. I cannot see how these individuals can add productive conversation, except for us responding to them and decrying the racist attitudes. But that takes a great deal of time and effort. But I cannot see a better way to handle it. </p>

<p>Censoring them very likely emboldens their beliefs in their position. Calmly explaining why racism is not a valuable tool for spurring change in society is good practice I suppose. Downvote racism to oblivion while engaging in reasonable dialogue with them to try and work through why the actions of a few are not, by default, the overtly intentional actions of many. </p>

<p>I think that, as a whole, the mods of this sub do a great job. But whichever mod reinstated this user and allowed him to go right back to doing what got him banned clearly sees nothing wrong with what <a href="/u/european88">/u/european88</a> is posting. And that is not a person who I want representing and moderating a community that I belong to.</p>

<p>Many Reddit users unjustly view this entire sub as anti-Semitic due to a small minority of our posters. I was very pleased to see that <a href="/u/quantumcipher">/u/quantumcipher</a> had banned <a href="/u/european88">/u/european88</a>, and was extremely dismayed to see that the ban had been lifted. Posters like him alienate those who are not yet awake, but might otherwise be receptive to conspiracy theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because frothing hate speech discredits us all. If it&#39;s findable by others and not an obvious ban, it <em>will</em> be dragged out and aired about as &#39;proof&#39; of how this sub is a haven for nazis and racists and therefor no one should pay any attention to anything else we say here. </p>

<p>The only chance we have to maintain even a modicum of credibility to outsiders is to be ruthless in slicing away these Stormfront types. They are well used as levers to shut down critical thought and discussion. You&#39;ll see them infiltrate a lot of freedom movements; there will usually be one that keeps quiet about it long enough to get into some kind of trust position and then starts unloading the hate, and then &#39;helpful&#39; researchers will trace down hitherto unknown (by the rest of the organizing people anyway) long-standing connections to this disgusting shit and use it to argue &#39;look, this guy has a <em>history</em>, that means the rest of these guys must have known and supported him!&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, my statement is very much an argument for self-moderation. If we, as a community, agree to shut out the discrediting attempts and make it clear that we don&#39;t tolerate that shit, it can&#39;t be used against us. It&#39;s been attempted in this sub already, and groups like conspiratard took those attempts and ran with them as far as they could - and are still running with them, even though what they claim is not the case (if it ever truly was). </p>

<p>Only rigorous self-moderation is going to help in this situation. What third party were you thinking about? The mods must come from the userbase and there should always be a method in place where we can get rid of people found to be abusing their power in order to discredit the sub. This sub is marginalized enough as it is that we definitely can&#39;t afford to let it be marginalized further by the stuff that we don&#39;t even want here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In retrospect, I wouldn&#39;t have banned a user solely for posting certain domains I happen to dislike personally, due to their offensive and controversial nature, domains the majority here happen to dislike as well.</p>

<p>The primary reason he was banned recently was due to him posting blatantly racist commentary, shit I won&#39;t even repeat because it&#39;s just over the top and unnecessary.</p>

<p>The mod who unbanned him decided to give him a second chance. I&#39;m all for second chances, depending on the circumstances, if the user seems reasonable and agrees not to continue violating the rules of our sub repeatedly. As his unbanning was conditional he was re-banned upon repeating the same offense.  In the end, he got what he deserved and I have no regrets nor qualms regarding the manner in which it was handled. </p>

<p>If you happen to disagree, I&#39;ll be sure to read your concerns and take them into consideration when moderating in the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen a few good allies go over to what they call the white rights movement, with pseudo-science backing them like <em>The Bell Curve</em>and Stephen Pinker&#39;s recent shitheap <em>The Better Angels of Our Nature</em>. It seems to me it&#39;s actually the ones who don&#39;t drool and demagogue, it&#39;s the reasonable-sounding racists, who lend credibility to the cause.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe you, but I&#39;ll play along...</p>

<p>How do you explain your posting history in <a href="/r/GreatApes">/r/GreatApes</a> and <a href="/r/N1GGERS">/r/N1GGERS</a>? And your moderating of <a href="/r/blackcrime">/r/blackcrime</a> for that matter?</p>

<p>In all seriousness though, you are very obviously a white supremacist. Of course <em>you</em> would defend the neo-nazi.</p>
