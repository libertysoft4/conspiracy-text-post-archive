    <div class="md"><p>Eh, yea something like that. The law of attraction as i mentioned is written abiut in rhinda burnes book called the secret. Theres a bunch of stuff written abiut it by very famous people. Its interesting, but unproven. So its almost like a cultish type belief, though in a very positive sense.</p>

<p>It basically talks about how our brains create brainwaves (proven) and those waves vibrate at certain frequencies (proven) based on specific thoughts (proven). So, negative thoughts vibrate differently than positive thoughts. The law of attraction teaches that certain frequencies will attract the same type of frequencies, so if you think positively, positive things will be attracted to you. And vice versa. Its very interesting. I dont necessarily bekieve it, but its pretty pleasant. It actually has a lot of similarities to buddhism and other religions (prayer for instance is just merely focusing your thoughts, and according to the law of attraction, helps to attract the outcome you are praying for...)</p>

<p>Ill try and find some links tomorrow for you if youre still interested...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Secret isn&#39;t incorrect as such, but it is way too simplified and misses the point imo. Karma is confounding to mortal man and attempting to alter it to gain money or some other kind of fleeting novelty is kind of a waste of human potential. My previous comment was actually a paraphrasing from a mahayana sutra fwiw. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotcha.. yea i assume it is over simplified due to the proponents attempt to spread it on a mass scale. It has actually inspired me to look deeper into buddhism, though i still have to own up to that inspiration. And yes, you are definately correct that it is a bit more materialistic than other ideologies. Nonetheless, the core foundations are condusive to a happier being, imo.</p>

<p>At the very least it can serve as a wonderful segway into a more spiritual (in the nonreligious sense, as i view the two as mutually exclusive, meaning you can be spiritual without being religious and vice versa) way of life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know I have heard stories of people coming together in a group sitting in a circle and meditating. In the middle of the circle was a bucket of water. They apparently meditated about liquid water becoming ice. Eventually the water did turn to ice.</p>

<p>I agree with you. The mind is amazing. And if we have yet to unlock our full DNA potential who knows what we are capable of. My mother travels the world studying with indigenous shamans.

<p>Friday the 13th gained its notoriety as being the date that the Knights Templar got massacred. <sup><sup>[citation</sup></sup> <sup><sup>needed]</sup></sup></p>

<p>Although it seems interesting that so many collapse-type threads are hitting front page on mainstream subreddits. Perhaps something is planned regarding a financial collapse. (Significant connection to the contribution of the Knights Templar.) After all, money is the new religion...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not that it holds any real merit, but I&#39;ve been hearing about an astrological alignment on the 14th in which supposedly some real shit could go down. </p>

<p>Who knows, nothing may happen, but I do feel big things are around the corner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be, though im betting theyre saving the financial collapse for the finale. Maybe theyll report that russia and china finally and officially abandoned the petrodollar or something along those lines, setting the stage for the process of financial collapse to begin?</p>

<p>Or maybe china will finally say they want to collect their debt?</p>

<p>Fuck, there are so many different things, even just in the financial topic, ill just wait amd see what tomorrow brings (if anything.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Though, i have a sneaky feeling its gonna be gun-related. Obama is nearing the hakfway mark for his last term and hes got nothing but scandals to prove his legacy. Hes been ramping up his gun control anthems as of late. So, theres my bet.</p>
