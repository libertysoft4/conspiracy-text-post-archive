They didn&#39;t even need much convincing to agree with the conclusion that it was probably a murder. There&#39;s a lot of average folks who have a sense of where we are, but there&#39;s a lot of doublethink too, and a lot of apathy. &quot;Yeah of course the government murdered him, that&#39;s how they do. Clinton 2016!&quot; They can accept the puppet show while simultaneously knowing it&#39;s just a show. Like wrestling fans.</p>

People are very quick to go the &quot;Oh well, that&#39;s just how it is&quot; route when it comes to politics and the state of the world.  What they don&#39;t consider is <em>why</em> things are the way they are, how they got this way, and where they&#39;re headed if we keep on the track we&#39;re on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. In my opinion people see the writing on the wall but don&#39;t care. Spying, wars, fourth amendment, second amendment etc. They song care until all of their freedoms are taken away in the name.of &quot;fighting for terrorism. People actually defend Obama on even the most asanine things he does. Nice brain washing by the MSM</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the first one.  Using a car for assassination is nothing new to these people.  I wouldn&#39;t rule out the possibility of some sort of bomb, however.  Here&#39;s the thing about me, I dont really believe in coincidences when it comes to my government.  They are shady motherfuckers, and Hastings sending that panicked email the night before this is too much of a coincidence for me to buy it.  My turn to ask a question, why exactly are you so convinced that this wasn&#39;t an assassination that you sit on reddit at 3 in the morning starting arguments with strangers defending the government?  what bombshell proofs or logic do you have that can change my mind about this situation? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if you agree that the car still crashed into the tree, why is the engine being on the other side of the street an issue?</p>

<p>And who said I&#39;m defending the government? I&#39;m naturally skeptical of conspiracy theories and if I&#39;m going to believe one that contradicts an official story that actually makes sense, I need definitive proof. And a bunch of coincidences are not proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been a year.  I had no idea who he was the day I heard of his death.  Then I started looking into it and HOLY SHIT.  He was totally murdered and in a crazy way... </p>

<p>I read his book &quot;The Operators&quot; and it was insanely informative.  That and &quot;Disaster Capitalism&quot; by Naomi Klein gave me a really good inside look at the ridiculous in-efficiency and just general pointlessness and aimlessness of the Iraq war.</p>

<p>Micheal Hastings had serious balls.  He was a journalist who didn&#39;t back down, was brutally honest and skeptical of authority.  He was good at finding the truth and calling people out.</p>

<p>Truly a martyr, this guy is my fucking hero.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeaaaaah, it was &quot;The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism&quot;</p>

<p>Thanks for the correction.</p>

<p>A great read.  It really explains and gives examples of exactly how corporations take advantage of disastrous situations, like the Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina.  They get to act recklessly, squandering massive sums of money, while doing a piss poor job of whatever they are supposed to do because there is practically no oversight/competition in disaster situations.</p>

<p>In her book, she doesn&#39;t believe any conspiracy about 9/11 but her book, to me, made it all the more clear why 9/11 was a perfect tool for the military industrial complex, because they did what she describes other companies and organizations doing in disaster situations.</p>

<p>Basically when disaster hits, rules fly out the window, and there are massive profits and power grabs to be had in the chaos.  Like with 9/11, right afterward they were able to pass the patriot act, implement the TSA, justify (wrongly) the wholesale domestic surveillance program, and start a bullshit war (which made Dick Cheney a lot of money).  It&#39;s a perfect example of disaster capitalism, on a national scale yet she clearly has not questioned or looked into 9/11, or is too afraid too, because 9/11 was no happy coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also, always, feel so disillusioned whenever &quot;drugs&quot; are involved. It&#39;s such an easy, and easily accepted scapegoat. This is especially true when you feed the story to people who have never tried drugs. You tell the people who have no idea how marijuana feels that the person committed some heinous crime because they were under the influence of weed and people buy it because they don&#39;t know any better and, after all, drugs are &quot;horrid, nightmarish chemicals - capable of making anyone do anything.&quot; That&#39;s why it&#39;s best to &quot;stay away.&quot; Believe me you &quot;don&#39;t even want to know.&quot; It&#39;s such bs.</p>
