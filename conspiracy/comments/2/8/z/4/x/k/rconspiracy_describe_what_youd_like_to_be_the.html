<li><p>World hunger would be solved because the first world countries would finally see that their gluttany and obesity creates vast amount of food waste, so they woukd take it upon themselves to eat less, and exercise more, and as an entire population become physically healthy. This woukd require the disassembly of Monsanto, completely. Also, this would require the abolishment of the FDA, or at least change it so fundamentally that it actualky works for the people.</p></li>
<li><p>Tesla&#39;s free wireless energy technology would be developed, refined, and utilized throughout the globe, for free access to electricity for everyone alive everywhere. This would include dissolving OPEC. Those who would lose their jobs in the oil/energy fields would be subsidized and later be trained and hired for jobs that are more condusive to a healthier environment, and a healthier people.</p></li>
<li><p>The War on Drugs would cease to exist. All drugs would be legal, but regulated. I wont go into depth here. This would require massive defunding of the FDA and certain divisions of law enforcement. </p></li>
<li><p>The Federal Reserve woukd be stripped of all and any rights and authorities to print money, or conduct any business for or with the united states, and all other countriez. It would be necessary to be rid of it, completely. </p></li>
<li><p>The american political theathre woukd have many changes. Politicians and representatives all would be necessitated to have a blog/forum on their website so that they can interact with their constituents more personably. All votes for everything woukd be on a case by case basis, instead of how things work today where you vote for a dude/dudette of the lesser evil.  </p></li>
<li><p>Obamacare would be abolished, completely.</p></li>
<li><p>Insider trading woukd be punished severely.</p></li>
<li><p>The theatre of war in the middle east would cease, as america pulls away its troops to allow the nations there to rule themselves. With the free energy technology previously stated, there woukd be no more need for oil, anywhere, by anyone. </p></li>
<li><p>all the moneys saved from ending the war on drugs, and in the middle east, and elsewhere, and the money recouped from eliminating wasteful spending woukd be reallocated towards free healthcare and education, including college. </p></li>
<li><p>With poverty, war, health and hunger all in check, the nations of the world would not have any more excuses to fight. There wouldnt be nearly as much competition for resources. The only squablles woukd be of tribal/cultural disputes or individual disputes. These woukd be dealt with via a worldwide code, agreed upon by all nations, but judged by and within the respective area of dispute by their peers. There would be no one world government. This would encourage all peoples to work together in order to achieve unforeseen accomplishments.</p></li>
<li><p>and, of course, the IRS would also be abolished. Completely.</p></li>

<p>the white race save itself from extinction</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no truth to this. While there does seem to be a trend that could cause the white race to become a minority, there is nothing that indicates even a remote possibility of the white race going extinct. </p>

<p>In the far, far future, however, if everything stays the same in regards to current trends, then statistically speaking, (far far into the future) the white race could end up becoming blended and not &quot;purely&quot; white.</p>

<p>Hiwever, current trends must remain the same during this loooooong procedure. And, if one pays attention to world trends, they woukd know that any given trend onky remains for a relatively very short period of time. </p>

<p>This argument that the white race is going extinct is produced largely through prejudice and fear, accompliced by logical fallacies as a basis of argument. </p>

<p>As approximated by the 2012 census estimate, 78% of americas population is white.  Being predominately white, it would take america a very very long time to dillute the white race, even considering current immigration trends. It would take even longer to titrate the white race to extinction. </p>

<p>Its just not going to happen. The white race is not in any danger whatsoever.</p>

<p>Again, yes, it is.</p>

<p>Faith is by definition belief in something for which there is no evidence. Not shaky evidence. Not controversial evidence. No. Something completely imaginary.</p>

<p>The only time imaginary stuff is &quot;good&quot; is when it&#39;s labeled &quot;fiction&quot; and used solely for entertainment purposes.</p>

<p>Sorry if it seems like i keep butting in. I apologize for that. But i woukd like to respectfully disagree with this too. </p>

<p>Ill reference egyptologists (who are scientists) and their inability to let go of their pride in the ancient egyptian people who they claim built the pyramids and the sphynx, despite conusive evidence against that claim. Instead of acknowledging said evidence and admitting that they, then, do not know who built such structures, they disregard said evidence and hold on to their &quot;faith&quot; in pride.</p>

<p>Science itself is also a religion. Or at least as i see it...</p>

<p>It&#39;s very uneducated to cherry pick a few instances out of a large whole, consider that the norm, and form your opinion based upon that.</p>

<p>In other words, you&#39;ve skewed the data to favor your pre-supposition which is just about the least scientific thing you can do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, ive recognized your username as ive seen your contributions to this cummunity for some time now. I have generally received you as a logical, respectable person. Please dont taint my respect for you with arrogance. </p>

<p>Now, id like the opportunity to defend myself. Ill start with the hypocrisy if your own comment, the previous one where you felt that the stoning of individuals etc (wherein you had bulleted points) represented support for your claim that faith itself is inherently bad. You took those examples of stoning (as you put it, cherry picked) to represent your &quot;pre-supposition&quot; that faith itself is inherently bad. That clearly is hypocritical of your entire previous comment to which this is in response to.</p>

<p>With that said, yes, i did take one instance to represent a whole. That is, i took an example with the egyptologists to represent the entire scientific community. I suppose that would be considered wrong. Or at least a logical fallacy, so i apologize. What i meant by pointing that out, is that science is not always okay with admitting they are wrong. Sometimes they are, but not always. Religion can be seen in the same view, though.</p>

<p>For example, religion used to say that lightning was gods way of showing his anger. Now, theyve recanted (at least some religions have) that explanation, for the better and more logical one that science proposes.</p>

<p>In this same way, the existence of duality within any argument, you have to be able to understand my position when i say that faith, itself, is not inherently bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the notion that a deity exists to explain the gaps in scientific knowledge. Just as you suggested - early humans attributed all sorts of weather, earthquakes, volcanoes, even diseases, to supernatural powers - gods or demons or whatever.</p>

<p>However, the way that works in practice is that each time science explains one of those things, it falls out of the realm of the supernatural. The logical conclusion, over time, to that pattern is that there really are scientific, not supernatural, explanations for everything but we haven&#39;t figured them out yet.</p>

<p>Ergo, there is no god.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I need to retreat to a previous position.</p>

<p>Faith is bad because it is not based on reality - what is real, what is factual. Further, it often seeks to deny pursuit of facts or new knowledge, believing itself to be accurate already and not wanting to be disproven.</p>

<p>Here I&#39;m talking specifically of spiritual type faith.</p>

<p>Faith in people you trust, for example my faith in my spouse, daughter, and parents, is different and a good thing (if accurately placed).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, this explains it better. For the most part i agree. I feel like i understand your position, and i admit, it makes sense. I cant say it is wrong, its just i guess i feel a little differently about it. But thats okay, its what being openminded is all about. Thanks for your patience, btw.</p>

<p>Also, i wanted to ask, wouldnt belief in no god also constitute as faith? I mean by the way you previously defined it, as belief in something without any actual evidence. I ask this because i dont believe there is any evidence to support he does not exist, so its equal to the idea of faith in the existence of god, but opposite... Whats your position on that? (This doesnt change our respective positions on the argument of whether or not faith is inherently bad, as far as im concerned...)</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>wouldnt belief in no god...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Atheism isn&#39;t belief in no god, or belief of sort at all. It&#39;s not believing in things for which there is no evidence... well, specifically deities for which there is no evidence.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to &quot;believe&quot; that there&#39;s no invisible pink unicorn standing behind me eating 4 leaf clovers and farting a rainbow, right?</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to &quot;believe&quot; that I just sent you a cheque for 10 million dollars.</p>

<p>The onus of burden of proof - of providing evidence - is on the party making the claim. In the case of theism / religion / faith, the claim is that a deity exists. Or we could go with the claim that the unicorn exists. Or the cheque exists. Given the absence of evidence for all those things, the reasonable / rational person will not &quot;believe&quot; any of them.</p>

<p>You also don&#39;t have to &quot;believe&quot; that the sun burns hot, the earth revolves around it every 365-point-something days, gravity pulls objects with mass toward each other, that 5x3=15, that the earth&#39;s atmosphere is warming at an exponentially faster pace than at any point in its history after life came to be on it, or any other scientific fact. Facts do not require belief. They simply are.</p>

<p>I like facts. They&#39;re real. I can make good decisions based on them, and decisions I make based on facts usually turn out the way I expect them to.</p>

<p>I dislike &quot;belief&quot; and faith. They equate to the absence of fact, which is as far as I&#39;ll take it, but for some they also equate to the denial of fact. Decisions based on those things never seem to turn out as well as decisions based on facts.</p>

<p>Just one example of belief not working out so hot. A lot of people &quot;believed&quot; the earth was flat as recently as 1492. They thought Columbus would sail off to his death, plummeting over whatever the edge of the world was. Columbus had evidence to the contrary (starting with the way he noticed ships appeared when they came over the horizon) and so he did what he did and here we are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, sir, quite literally, atheism IS the belief in no god. As in, that is the official definition from merriem-webster, oxford, wikipedia, etc. </p>

<p>But, other than that, i generally agree with your points. Through the way you see the definition of &quot;faith&quot;, i would say i have to agree with you. Its just a matter of how we define things. So, where we agree, lets agree. </p>

<p>Where we dont agree, for instance i see atheism to require a special form of faith (of your definition of faith), wherein there is no evidence for that claim. I feel we are gonna clash on that point alittle, but thats okay. I dont mind agreeing to disagree on that point.</p>

<p>That is incorrect. Even if that&#39;s the way it&#39;s written in the dictionary, that&#39;s incorrect. Atheism is the lack of belief in a god. Atheism is not a belief. It is the lack of, absence of, belief.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Then you still don&#39;t understand what atheism is.</p>

<p>Do you need any special form of faith to disbelieve that there is a pink, rainbow-farting unicorn watching over my shoulder as I mail you a $10,000,000 cheque? It&#39;s exactly the same thing.</p>

<p>With all due respect, this is a half-truth. There are some extremely valuable and beneficial virtues taught by religion. However, it is when it becomes organized, controlled, and capitalized/prayed (pardon the pun) upon, or otherwise abused for a mechanism of complacency/ignorance/control that it becomes dangerous and destructive to the very values they teach.</p>

<p>It is not the faith in religion that becomes a wrongdoing. It is what is done within that faith, or in the name of that faith, that becomes a wrongdoing, and becomes de facto hypocrisy. </p>

<p>In short, the fundamental virtues taught by religion is very beneficial to society. The organization, enforcement, and control of those values is what becomes destructive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, those are excellent examples of the hypocrisy of religion. You are right, thiugh, that these are codified into their holy books. Supposedly from their god. But, hypocritical, nonetheless.</p>

<p>The bibke even states that it is written down by man, dictated by god. But, it is also said that man has free will, therefore there is nothing to stop them from wrongful interpretation, or even wrongful editting. Thus, it is the folly of man, not the fundamental virtues, that make religion an easy medium of exploitation.</p>

<p>I find it prudent to point out that we both feel very similarily towards religion. We both distrust it, and we both view it with negativity. We both see the evil that perpetrates from its exploitation. However, i refuse to allow my distrust of religion to overshadow my observation of the beneficial virtues that religion hypocritically teaches as a means to entice a people towards their scheme.</p>

<p>For what its worth, you can describe me as an agnostic atheist. I do not claim that i know for a fact that god does or does not exist because there is no evidence to support either claim; therefore i choose to believe that god does not exist.</p>

<p>To state that it is a fact that god does not exist because there is no evidence of his existence is a false dichotomy, a logical fallacy, as it excludes the acknowledgement of another option in which the statements are neither true nor false due to the fact thst it is unknowable. Absence of evidence for the existence of god does not equate to evidence of the absence of god. Thus, i choose to believe there is no god. </p>

<p>Not sure if that helps, though, but i thought id include that info in case it would help.</p>

<p>I see virtues in very few religious people. The &quot;flock&quot; of you will. Sometimes I see virtues in the lowest level priests, but that&#39;s not the norm. Morality comes from being human and empathetic, not from being religious.</p>

<p>To me, the louder someone spouts about their religion, the more likely they are to be using it as a crutch for their own immorality. It&#39;s an obvious and consistent marker.</p>
