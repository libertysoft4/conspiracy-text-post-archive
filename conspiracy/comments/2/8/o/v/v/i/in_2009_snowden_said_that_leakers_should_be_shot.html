    <div class="md"><p>0:20-- theres no evidence of a plane having hit anywhere near the pentagon jamie mcintyre   the fallong of the wall, it fell 45 </p>

<p><a href="http://theuglytruth.wordpress.com/2011/08/31/flight-77-did-not-hit-the-pentagon/">http://theuglytruth.wordpress.com/2011/08/31/flight-77-did-not-hit-the-pentagon/</a></p>

<p>Albert N. Stubblebine III is a retired Major General in the United States Army. He was the commanding general of the United States Army Intelligence and Security Command from 1981 to 1984.  In this compelling interview, Stubblemine reveals the following information (what he calls “dots”) about the attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001:</p>

<p>Stubblebine initially believed the official story regarding 9/11.
Then, he saw the hole in the Pentagon. </p>

<p>He can prove that the Pentagon was not hit by a Boeing 757. DOT.</p>

<p>All of the sensors around the Pentagon were turned off except one. That one sensor captured an image of the object the hit the Pentagon.  It looked like a missile.  But, after he went public, the imagery was changed to look like a plane. </p>

<p>The collapse of the twin towers was caused by controlled demolition – not the fuel from the airplane. DOT.</p>

<p>Larry Silverstein, the lease holder of the WTC complex, admitted that that building 7, which was not hit by a plane and had only a small fire, was intentionally “pulled” – which is phraseology used for controlled demolition.  </p>

<p>All of the air defense systems around Washington DC were turned off that day. DOT.
Also on 9/11, there was an exercise designed to mimic an attack on the towers by airplanes.  DOT.</p>

<p>When you connect the DOTs, the picture says that what we were told by the media was not the real story.</p>

<p>Stubblebine, visibly upset, describes how he felt when he realized the truth about his government after having a strong belief in his country since early childhood: “My belief system was so strong from age five when I could remember standing on a parade ground at attention with not anybody telling me to do that – at West Point.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, let us first consider the source. The header: &quot;Zionism, Jewish extremism and a few other nasty items making our world uninhabitable today.&quot; Already we have presumptions going in, and makes the entire article suspicious of manipulation and deception. It&#39;s also way too much info for me to sift through, but I&#39;ll still consider what you quoted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He was the commanding general of the United States Army Intelligence and Security Command from 1981 to 1984.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So not involved in the any official position involved in 9/11. OK, so I&#39;ll hear out his speculations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He can prove that the Pentagon was not hit by a Boeing 757</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, to prove something you need evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It looked like a missile. But, after he went public, the imagery was changed to look like a plane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see zero evidence for this claim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The collapse of the twin towers was caused by controlled demolition – not the fuel from the airplane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see zero evidence for this claim.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I see no reason to believe he was referring to some &#39;controlled demolition.&#39; To me, it sounded like he was saying to &#39;pull&#39; the firefighters. Either way, what phrasing he chose is not proof of anything unless he specifically mentioned a controlled demolition.</p>

<p>Citation? I don&#39;t know much about this claim.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Given that, according to the Pentagon Building Performance Report, &quot;<a href="http://www.twf.org/News/Y2003/01-PBPR.pdf">the aircraft frame most certainly was destroyed before it had traveled a distance that approximately equaled the length of the aircraft (p. 40)</a>&quot;, and that &quot;it is highly unlikely that any significant portion of the fuselage could have retained structural integrity at this point in its travel (p. 40)&quot;, can you explain what caused the most perfectly round exit hole in the outer wall of the C-Ring?</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTION: Given that the maximum fluctuation between the two cameras would translate in a difference of 25 feet in the position of the plane, can you provide a valid explanation for the large discrepancy between the two corresponding frames (23:19)? Absent a valid explanation for this discrepancy, we must conclude that at least one of the two frames is the result of intentional manipulation, or &quot;photoshopping&quot;.</strong></p>

<p>-------------------------------------------------------<strong>THE AIRPORTS</strong></p>

<p>19 alleged terrorists (<em>to be referred just as terrorists from now on</em>) were able to avoid hundreds of airport CCTVs, except 3.</p>

<p>Of those 3, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLEqjpHVPhM">one of the recordings</a> (<em>which will be named Dulles from now on</em>) that was only <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5485376/ns/us_news-security/t/sept-panelcriticizes-dullessecurity-screeners/">released in 2004</a> poses a serious problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>At least until the date of the 9/11, all of the CCTVs available (<em>including the Pentagons&#39;</em>) only recorded at 1-5FPS and had timestamps while the <em>Dulles</em> was recording at +12FPS(<em>if I am not mistaken</em>) and has no timestamp.</li>
</ul>

<p>The airports, which the terrorists used, have hundreds of CCTVs that cover the entrances and all of the public areas, yet only 1 camera from 2 airports (<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLEqjpHVPhM">Dulles</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNVWpjOjLe0">Portland, Maine</a></em>) were able to capture 6 of the 19 terrorists.</p>

<p>The airplane victims were also never captured by the airport CCTVs. In contrast, here is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5Ie1uLT5AA">constant tracking via CCTV of the navy yard shooting</a> using all the CCTVs that captured the shooter outside and inside the building.</p>

<p>Somehow the Logan airport failed to record a single victim and/or terrorist.</p>

<p>--------------------------------------------------------<strong>THE HIJACKS</strong></p>

<p>Every pilot and co-pilot is instructed with transponder squawk codes, one of them -<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UZiQUNl76M&amp;amp;t=46">7500</a></em>- is the code for <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=57d_1392620694">hijacking</a> and it takes 3s to input and send.</p>

<p>Despite having 4 pilots and 4 co-pilots, not one of them sent out the 3s squawk as they were instructed to.</p>

<p>The alleged Flight11&#39;s FDR shows that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzR-q0ijbV0&amp;amp;t=251">the airplane was too high</a> to have struck the lamp posts.</p>

<p>Todd Beamer, one of Flight93&#39;s passenger, described the hijack occuring as he was speaking (<em>at <a href="http://i.imgur.com/5Vx2cxf.jpg">9:43 AM</a></em>) when in fact this event had already happened <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93#Hijacking">~20 minutes earlier</a>.</p>

<p>--------------------------------------------------------<strong>THE CRASHES</strong></p>

<p>-------------------------<em>TWIN TOWERS</em>--------------------------------</p>

<p>Both <a href="http://i.imgur.com/HoPAI3z.jpg">Flight11</a> and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/LiUu2rH.jpg">Flight175</a> produced a bright flash before they crashed into the towers. To this day they have never explained what caused this.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Static discharge:</p>

<ul>
<li>Would hardly be visible in daylight</li>
<li>It would produce a white/blueish color, not orange</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Reflection:</p>

<ul>
<li>As the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/LiUu2rH.jpg">image posted before</a> shows the flash seen from multiple vantage points, the idea of it being a reflection is not possible because reflections can only be seen from one vantage point</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Colision sparks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Much like with the static discharge, these would hardly be visible in daylight</li>
<li>It would have to occur on the entire length of the airplane that hits the facade: the wings would have to produce those as well</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>-------------------------<em>THE PENTAGON</em>-------------------------------</p>

<p>Only 2 cameras recorded an object crashing into the Pentagon, one recorded only a flash.</p>

<p>The 2 cameras that recorded the object show a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/EvtM7nN.jpg">white smoke</a> coming from the object that the Flight77 could not have produced:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Engine damage from lamp-posts impact: Not possible, airplane engine smoke produces a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KhZwsYtNDE">thin and dark smoke</a></p></li>
<li><p>Fuel leaking from tank damage or engine damage: Not possible, it didn&#39;t catch fire when the airplane exploded, the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/dJkv2XB.jpg">lawn has no jetfuel burn marks</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Contrails: Not possible seen that the humidity levels were not enough, corroborated by the lack of those on both airplanes that crashed into the twin towers</p></li>
<li><p>Condensation: Not possible, same reason as contrails</p></li>
<li><p>Rocket/missile-like smoke: Strongly resembles the smoke produced by <a href="http://i.imgur.com/WXrH3vv.jpg">missiles/rockets</a> and <strong>might explain</strong> why Pentagon personel stated that they noticed the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Even+before+stepping+outside+I+could+smell+the+cordite">smell of cordite</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>These 2 cameras have all frames perfectly synchronized -<em>including the moment of the high speed explosion</em>- except the one where the object enters the frame. According to the cameras, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7mDXHn_byA&amp;amp;t=1134">the airplane existed in 2 different places in the same moment of time.</a></p>

<p>-------------------------<em>THE PENNSYLVANIA</em>---------------------------</p>

<p>Despite the entire airplane allegedly plunged into the ground, one of the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/CvyJNQw.png">engines jumped to a considerable distance from the crash site</a>. This engine was attached to the same airplane as the other one, diving at the same speed as the other one and hitting the same ground as the other one, yet one of the engines was buried and the other landed far away for no reason. </p>

<p>The engine that was buried under the ground was <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4IcZzuY.jpg">compressed along it&#39;s length under</a>  ~3 and half feet of dirt. This engine had a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/r0dxyQB.jpg">clam shell</a> of considerable proportions, but for some reason not one part of that shell is present in the previously linked photo of the engine.</p>

<p>There were debris found at such a distance from the impact point of the airplane that it could not have been covered from its explosion, this path of debris suggests that the airplane was actually <a href="http://i.imgur.com/dmTLqpx.gif">flying on the opposite direction</a> and not the one officially told. This also fits <a href="http://i.imgur.com/TF5vSXo.png">Val MacClatchey&#39;s testimony of the plane path</a>.</p>

<p>Val MacClatchey&#39;s famous photo poses a serious problem, it displays a mushroom cloud that <a href="http://i.imgur.com/P0bEagi.jpg">is consistent with an explosion and not with a jet crash.</a> When an airplane crashes it produces a long column of smoke, not just a mushroom cloud. The lack of typical airplane crash aftermath smoke has also been confirmed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frtqTM5rUes">another witness</a>.</p>

<p>In contrast with Flight 93, here is an airplane crash of a Boeing 737-200 of 17,November 2013 that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koUV3xRIraU">nose dived</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatarstan_Airlines_Flight_363#Crash">70º</a> and still had plenty of <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2509388/Video-shows-Boeing-737-plane-crash-Russia-killing-50-people.html">easily identifiable airplane parts</a> and <a href="http://rt.com/news/kazan-crash-live-updates-876/">both engines were found in the same location.</a></p>

<p>Here you can see more airplane crashes comparisons with Flight 93 and see how unique Flight 93 was. <a href="http://killtown.911review.org/flight93/crash-comparisons.html">http://killtown.911review.org/flight93/crash-comparisons.html</a></p>

<p>----------------------------------------------------------<strong>THE CALLS</strong></p>

<p>There are 2 calls that contradict the offical version of events; the before mentioned <a href="http://i.imgur.com/MkjKRCV.png">Todd Beamer call and Jeremy Glick&#39;s</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Todd Beamer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flight 93 hijack occured at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93#Hijacking">9:28</a></li>
<li>Todd Beamer&#39;s call describes the hijack about to happen at <a href="http://intelfiles.egoplex.com/2001-09-11-FBI-FD302-lisa-jefferson.pdf">9:43</a></li>
<li>Flight 93 crashed at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93#Crash">10:03</a></li>
<li>Todd Beamer&#39;s call made with an airphone last for <a href="http://i.imgur.com/MkjKRCV.png">3925 seconds</a>. It last 45 minutes <strong>after</strong> the plane had already crashed.</li>
<li>Lisa Jefferson also confirms that the call was not lost: &quot;<em><a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/Inspiration/2006/06/I-Promised-I-Wouldnt-Hang-Up.aspx?p=2">We didn’t lose a connection because there’s a different sound that you use. It’s a squealing sound when you lose a connection. I never lost connection, but it just went silent.</a></em>&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Jeremy Glick:</p>

<ul>
<li>Call starts at 9:37</li>
<li>Flight 93 crashes at 10:03</li>
<li>Call lasts for 7565 seconds, placing the end of the call at 11:41. It last for 1 hour and ~38 minutes <strong>after</strong> the plane had already crashed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>These calls were made from the airplane&#39;s airphone destined to two different interfaces: One was to the GTE&#39;s assistant landline telephone, the other was to a cellphone.</p>

<p>These calls could not have remained connected by a system mistake because airphones charge per time, the system was built to only count the time the client is connected in order to avoid overcharging him by allowing calls to &quot;stay connected&quot; when they were not. The fact that they also disconnected at different times rules out any possible system fault which, if possible, would at best disconnect both calls at the same time since they would have &quot;disconnected&quot; at the same time, the time of the crash.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://pilotsfor911truth.org/ACARS-CONFIRMED-911-AIRCRAFT-AIRBORNE-LONG-AFTER-CRASH.html">ACARS data also corroborates the above</a>, seen that the only possible explanation for the calls to remain connected after the airplane crashed is that the airplane from where the calls came from never crashed in the first place.</p>
