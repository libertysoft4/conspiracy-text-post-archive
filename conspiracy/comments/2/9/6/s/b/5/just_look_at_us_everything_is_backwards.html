<p>Not if, again, we all came together as one and helped each other outside and independent of their control.</p>

<p>This.  100% agreed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we &quot;rose up&quot;, everything would fall apart</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we <em>all</em> rose up together and as one, then everything the elites have done would fall apart.  If we help one another <em>together</em>, we WOULDN&#39;T fall apart as the elite&#39;s world does.  We would stay afloat through the help we give each other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The powers-that-be would not go down quietly, or alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They might not go down quietly, but they would go down VERY alone if the slaves they use to do all their work (i.e. <em>us</em> - we the people) weren&#39;t on their side any longer to help implement their enslaving rule and were, instead, on each other&#39;s side as one human family.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But again, the thing is, at this point its still a better outcome. Because that is probably going to happen anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems shit is indeed on its way toward hitting the fan, but - again - we as a people have unfortunately forgotten the power and ability we have if we but all come together.  The elite cannot compete with that.  Simple as that.  If we were to do that, then we <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> have anywhere near as difficult a time as many think.</p>

<p>Easier said than done, I know, but still true.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Seems that&#39;s exactly their m.o.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s all one big penny stock scam, and we are the fools left holding the bag.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that&#39;s our own fault because we continue agreeing to play their little shitty, enslaving game(s).  We wouldn&#39;t be stuck holding <em>any</em> bag if we combine our forces and powers and abilities as one people.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It would certainly <em>seem</em> that it would be difficult, of course.  However, the reason why it would be unrealistic is simply because we&#39;ve all been so brainwashed BY tptb to see each other as different based on all these faux teachings they&#39;ve indoctrinated into this civilization:  Religious and class division, ethnic and racial divides, social stratifications, etc, etc. are designed to keep us apart - but they&#39;re all bullshit, artificial divides that don&#39;t actually exist in reality.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really all bullshit, and if enough/all of us realize this, then our coming together as the one people that we are independent of all these contrived differences WOULD be possible and wouldn&#39;t be all that unrealistic at all actually.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s total and complete bullshit talking right there, man.  You say what you said here, why?  You say that because that&#39;s what TPTB have <em>indoctrinated</em> into you by all the tv and movies and MSM bullshit that we&#39;ve been watching from birth and that show and tell us that &quot;everything would be chaos!&quot; if we didn&#39;t have fucking big brother watching over and controlling us, telling us what to do.  That&#39;s, again, just total bullshit.  It doesn&#39;t <em>have</em> to be like that actually.  That&#39;s not like some &quot;necessary law&quot; of society that if we&#39;re not kept down by police force and/or whips and chains that we&#39;d be wild, savage animals and things would just turn into &quot;complete chaos&quot;.  No way, man.</p>

<p>That&#39;s ONE possibility, of course, but that is by no means the ONLY thing that can/would happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The masses are the masses because we don&#39;t organize.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then we need to fucking organize, dammit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even if there were an organized movement that overthrew the corporatocracy, there would be no one to run it,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The people together could run it.  Communal organization and communal self-leadership could do it.  Would it be easy?  Of course not.  However, it&#39;s not like we don&#39;t have it in us to do something like this.  I know this because I know <strong>I</strong> have it in me, and I&#39;m not different than you or anyone else, so we <em>all</em> have it in us to do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>no one to listen to those trying to run it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Proper, cooperating responsibility amongst individuals working together can go a long, long way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>no one to uphold the status quo and everything would crumble.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing would crumble if there is, again, organization, responsibility, and effort put in by everyone.  You don&#39;t need some &quot;lone leader&quot; telling you what to do.  And if you/we do, then why oh why on Earth does ANYONE <em>ever</em> get upset or offended when we&#39;re called Sheeple?  This is EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE if we can&#39;t figure out how to come together, be responsible, and run ourselves properly.  WTF? lol  Damn.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>don&#39;t make the naive mistake of thinking you can adjust a centuries old, global paradigm and have it be a smooth and successful transition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that I have kept saying over and over again that it wouldn&#39;t be easy should serve as at least SOME indication to you that I&#39;m not &quot;naive&quot; enough to think it would be cherry blossoms and roses all the way, bro.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It will mean decades of 3rd world living and millions of lost lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not necessarily in the least.  Again, communal cooperation can mitigate any and all factors, as it&#39;s not like we&#39;re not being able to function properly now under THIS shitty system we live in.  There&#39;s no reason we can&#39;t continue on but WITHOUT all the manipulation and bullshit involved.</p>

<p>The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his “natural superiors”, and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous “cash payment”. It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom — Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.</p>

<p>The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage labourers. </p>
