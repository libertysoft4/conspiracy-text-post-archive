I&#39;ve offered to share the information I have for free with anyone who joins, and we will be working together to narrativize that information while supplementing it with additional research so that it can be easily digested by a broad public audience.

    <div class="md"><p>My belief is that we should go the other way with this. There are so many people that want to bring truth to the people that its probably better if we dont remain anonymous. I have nothing to hide, im on the path of truth and im not going to let fear of consequences get in the way of that. Silence breeds repression. So I will stand up and be heard and if they take me down, another will take my place.</p>

<p>The more people who stand up to the threats to  activism by letting themselves be known who they are, the worse its going to be for the people that are trying to persecute us. When the world sees how many people are working on the side of truth, when the hammer comes down its going to be known to all and it will allow them to choose where they stand. I think that now that we have a communication system that allows us to send our message to people in a short amount of time is our protection.</p>

<p>I think the only thing I have a problem with is trying to centralize it with a name or ideal.
The peoples intelligence commonwealths is more appropriate. This thing needs to be distributed, not centralized in name or concept.</p>

<p>Hmm yeah that&#39;s a good point. Ill have to think about that some more and respond later if I have something to add.</p>

<p>On the topic of distribution, organization and information are you in agreement with that?
Maybe you should look at my <a href="http://www.goldenpath.net/alliance-truth/making-world-better/forming-new-commonwealths">commonwealth</a> idea I am working on at my <a href="http://www.goldenpath.net/">website</a> to get an idea of what I am talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it&#39;s more like a part of each commonwealth.  Every commonwealth needs to share part of the process of gathering and distributing intelligence among the commonwealths. If we have just one central intelligence apparatus hooked into it that part becomes more powerful then the parts it&#39;s connected to.  Similar to what&#39;s happening right now with the CIA. </p>

<p>Each commonwealth should have its own group or representative that takes part in the gathering and distribution efforts in real time as the information is being released. The information should be stored  using some kind of file sharing protocol like BitTorrent. That way if one peer gets shut down the information can continue to be accessed. I still think it&#39;s a good idea for each representative to be vetted based on his or her participation.</p>

<p>IMHO the biggest problem we have to face is people becoming ego centered in their efforts and subjecting themselves corruption by outside influences after they had been established in the community.</p>

<p>This is why it&#39;s important for it to be run as a collective. Any thoughts and ideas to improve the situation of preventing an intelligence gathering effort from becoming centralized would be welcome. I won&#39;t support anything that can be taken over by one or more individuals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the wires are connected, monitoring can occur.</p>

<p>I like the idea of pooling efforts toward a common positive goal, yet I abhor secrecy- your reasoning for &quot;inner circles&quot; is to prevent people from &quot;derailing&quot; your efforts.  I say ideas stand on their own merit, if it&#39;s a good idea it can&#39;t be derailed so easily.</p>

<p>I support your desire to know technically how tor would be compromised, yet I would argue you should merely look at the capabilities of the physical technology and presume those capabilities are being exploited.  An example I can think of is that smartphones can read rfid hardware.  Most modern cash have rfid in them.  This means that every banknote can be individually numerated and monitored anywhere in proximity to smartphones.  This is an incredible power, yet nobody seems to suspect it would be utilized for some reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do they have bugs your house? Your car? Whatever is broadcast isn&#39;t private. Private corporations are reading your keystrokes. Local Law enforcement are reading your posts. </p>

<p>They  don&#39;t care. Because of credibility. Most people will cling to whatever was said first. Most people hear what the officials want them to hear. Most people think however the officials conditioned them to think. You can expose the very fabric of this reality and most people will not care or believe you. Truth shall prevail but for most humans credibility equals truth. Most will die never knowing the difference. That&#39;s why they don&#39;t care unless you are doing something illegal. </p>

<p>My personal stance is on the NSA etc etc...since I have known about their capabilities before 9-11 ...meh.  If information is broadcast it is not considered private. 
If the NSA decides to bug our homes or vehicles then I would be outraged.</p>

<p>The story on creating sock puppets is a confirmation of something I had long suspected when truthers were posting legitimate documents. </p>

<p>To address your link: that&#39;s a pretty weird post and I think it&#39;s kinda creepy that you felt the need to dig through two weeks of my comment history in order to figure out that I&#39;m suspicious of Snowden and Greenwald.  If you wanted to know my opinion you could&#39;ve just asked me.</p>

<p>It goes back to the Hegelian idea of creating a conflict and then controlling both sides of the conflict and, thus, controlling the outcome.  The people who control public perception are masters of subtlety, propaganda, coercion, suggestion, etc (they&#39;ve had many, many years of practice after all).  Sowing confusion and discord among people who are attempting to find the truth about things has always been one of their main objectives.</p>

<p>look when the sub was created, 8 months AFTER snowden came out? maybe a user initially loved greenwald, then read tarpleys article.... then had a lightbulb go off and tried to create <a href="/r/limitedhangout">/r/limitedhangout</a> only to find it was already made.</p>

<p>My opinion about your sub (I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s your sub?) is that not all of the subscribers are legit users.  I believe that it has been &quot;infiltrated&quot; to some extent just as many subs on reddit have been, especially those that talk about &quot;sensitive topics&quot;.

<p>well yea, duh, not all are legit. just like here in conspiracy not all are legit.</p>

<p>and as far as infiltrated.. that means they would have to be posting , right?</p>

<p>when i first made it, within the first week there a few shill acc&#39;s IMO that commented on my initial text posts</p>

<p>and then i had the idea of keeping the sub to only 1 page of content, and youd see that like all the posts had 10 up/down votes</p>
