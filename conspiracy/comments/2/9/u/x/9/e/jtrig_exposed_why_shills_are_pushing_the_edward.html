    <div class="md"><p>Based on the fact that there is a recruiter from the <em>People&#39;s Intelligence Agency</em> vigorously attempting to persuade me that Snowden is above criticism; </p>

<p>I am now inclined to believe that he has some serious conflict of interest which vaguely relates to Marxism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I must preface this by saying that I do not have any strong convictions one way or the other upon the motivations and purpose of old Ed Snowden; but, that being said, here is my <em>prima facie</em> assessment: if Edward Snowden is who he, Greenwald, US politicians (Kerry, <em>et alii</em>), and the media claims he is, then why the fuck hasn&#39;t he been assassinated? </p>

<p>Assassinations happen <strong>all</strong> the time; often in very obvious ways, to the critic who might claim that Snowden is <em>too</em> public. The US uses assassination like a microwave: frequently, and a bit too much.</p>

<p>The idea that he can&#39;t be found, or that he is too protected seems to be bullshit. Most targets can get got. But, there is always the precedent of Castro.</p>

<p>Either way, the situation appears to me as thus: if Snowden was really an enemy of the state, and not a limited hangout, so to speak, he&#39;d be fucking dead. <em>Res ipsa loquitur</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What good would that do? He isn&#39;t releasing the documents personally and other people/orgs have copies.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t buy it.</p>

<p>The US has a history of disproportionate aggression towards its enemies, regardless of whether they, at the moment of murder, occupied overtly hostile roles. Weapons of mass destruction, for example...</p>

<p>The reasons for political assassination are varied; but rest assured, that if Ed Snowden was the real deal he&#39;d be fucking dead before he could even have passed off his information to Greenwald, or anyone, for that matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that I might be drawing a non sequitur, and that I might be grasping at straws: utilizing unproven examples as evidence; but still, I imagine that the situation sits something like this:</p>

<p>Had Snowden been a real threat to the US, he would have been killed before anyone knew who he was. The fact that he is an international hero seems indicative of the possibility that he is something of a limited hangout, to use the term. His being killed now, given this situation, would be nonsensical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but we know that the CIA often acts through privately contracted jackals, correct? The CIA doesn&#39;t need to be responsible for anything, in most cases; nor the US state at large.</p>

<p>My position, and again I am not married to this position whatsoever--just my knee-jerk, <em>prima facie</em> deduction--is that the leaks are released to enact that simplest of psychological tactics upon the US populace: self-policing in the face of alleged surveillance. I could dig up the psychological study, and can if you want, but it seems to be well known that an individual--a population of individuals in this case--self-censor both actions and thoughts in the face of known, overt surveillance. </p>

<p>I would posit that, given this position, Evo Morales&#39; grounded plane was but smoke and mirrors, to further hammer home the whole &quot;enemy of the state&quot; light that Snowden has been depicted in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assassinate him and remove all doubt that he&#39;s a fake leaker, and martyr him.  That&#39;s pretty good reason.  Also, it is kindof dirty and risky from a world-diplomacy point of view (not that that alone would prevent such action were it deemed necessary).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s bullshit, though. That statement, &quot;assassinate him and make him a martyr&quot; is completely memetic: when has it ever really happened? Heads of state are assassinated all the time. Smedley Butler was most likely assassinated and no one gave a shit. Max Gerson. Attempts on Chavez, Castro, and others. Nobody gives a shit as long as you tell them it was a suicide, stomach cancer, or what have you.</p>

<p>Besides, you are completely missing the point. His assassination now would be nonsensical. He serves the purpose of a controlled release of information: &quot;you are being surveilled; self-censor your activities and habits.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I meant in the sense that Manning could be considered a martyr.  Just meaning that it provides an example of someone who did &quot;the right thing&quot; and suffered or died for it.</p>

<p>I dispute the statement that nobody cares about any of your examples provided.  True, none of their deaths or the attempts on their lives have provoked mass revolution, yet the definition of a martyr is just someone who dies for their beliefs, it requires no followers or for anyone else to take action based on their sacrifice.</p>

<p>I would say that at this point, if some of Snowden&#39;s material is of value and the intelligence community wishes for him to appear less credible, leaving him alive would seem to sow more doubt about his credibility than killing him at this time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear you. You make cogent points, and while I respect your argument, I just don&#39;t feel it to be true. I feel that Snowden would have been killed before even making it anywhere with his knowledge, had he actually posed a threat; but, my supposition acknowledges the complete control of the US state--maybe it is much more chaotic than that. </p>

<p>I just feel that telling the public that they are being surveilled from email to Skype, Facebook to Google searches, does much more than not telling them; and how better to tell them than through a young, eloquent &quot;leaker.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a somewhat complicated mess, and I too feel that if the US wished him dead he would be so, and quite some time ago as you said.</p>

<p>The whole situation does indeed serve as a means of intimidating the populace, no matter how you look at it.</p>

<p>I also know that most of what he has &#39;revealed&#39; could have already been inferred by the nature of the technology.  If smartphones are effectively bugging technology, I don&#39;t need a whistleblower to tell me that it&#39;s being used as such.  It can only be further confirmation of what was already known to be possible.  I guess a lot of people think that networked electronics are perfectly encrypted even though they themselves have no knowledge of such things.</p>

<p>Whatever the nature of Mr.Snowden and also his information, it&#39;s a bit distracting and also manipulated to the maximum advantage of the security state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most readily available argument I can think of which implies he&#39;s legitimate is that he provides an example of a whistle blower who didn&#39;t get locked up or killed right away, which is a somewhat dangerous precedent if you don&#39;t want leaks.  Though, anyone who would follow his example can still expect a difficult time, obviously, so it&#39;s not a very definitive reason to believe in him.</p>

<p>You make a strong case, yet I think I have to focus on the message not the messenger, that&#39;s the best method here.  For all I know Mr.Snowden is legitimate in his own mind but he&#39;s under some kind of mind control and is an unknowing puppet on that level.  It&#39;s all really irrelevant compared to whether the released information is valid and useful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a mod over at <a href="/r/limitedhangouts">/r/limitedhangouts</a> and I can confirm that I am not getting paid by anyone.  I have studied propaganda and how it works.  They needed a way to steer the &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; crowd back into the mainstream and legitimize a hero figure for them to follow.  Snowden was <em>given</em> to us.  The guardian even asked for permission from the NSA to release any of the information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On some level, that interview almost seemed like a diplomatic meeting.  When the interviewer asks about if he&#39;d like to come home etc, it&#39;s like he&#39;s speaking on behalf of the government.</p>

<p>It is interesting.  I feel the nature of this whole situation will be more clear when more info comes out, or if someone hurts Snowden.  I would prefer more information to be revealed.</p>
