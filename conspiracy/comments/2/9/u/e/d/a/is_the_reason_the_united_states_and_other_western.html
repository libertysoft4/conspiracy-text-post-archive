    <div class="md"><p>Voting still works for city council elections, referendums.  It got weed legalized in WA and CO, It got a socialist elected on city council in Seattle; Meanwhile Oregon activists burned their voting referendums in 2011 as if they were bravely dodging Vietnam war, and <strong>guess what, pot didn&#39;t get legalized in Oregon</strong></p>

<p>There really is more nuance to People&#39;s influence.  We are more likely to be able to use city councils and referendums to our advantage than to pass a Constitutional Amendment To Get Money Out Of Politics©, whatever that means.</p>

<p>Edit: He also said &quot;Democracy is nothing more than mob rule, where 51% of the people may take away the rights of the other 49%.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To take from one, because it is thought that his own industry and that of his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who, or whose fathers have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association, —the guarantee to every one of a free exercise of his industry, &amp; the fruits acquired by it.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Google took me to a Benjamin Franklin page, under the &#39;Misartributed&#39; section.  Apparently its a modern quote from the 1990&#39;s.</p>

<p>&quot;Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch. Liberty is a well-armed lamb contesting the vote.&quot;
Widely attributed to Franklin on the Internet, sometimes without the second sentence. It is not found in any of his known writings, and the word &quot;lunch&quot; is not known to have appeared anywhere in English literature until the 1820s, decades after his death. The phrasing itself has a very modern tone and the second sentence especially might not even be as old as the internet. Some of these observations are made in response to a query at Google Answers.[9]
The earliest known similar statements are:
A democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch.
Gary Strand, Usenet group sci.environment, 23 April 1990. [10]
Democracy is not freedom. Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to eat for lunch. Freedom comes from the recognition of certain rights which may not be taken, not even by a 99% vote.
Marvin Simkin, &quot;Individual Rights&quot;, Los Angeles Times, 12 January 1992:[11]
Democracy must be something more than two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner.
James Bovard, Lost Rights: The Destruction of American Liberty (1994), ISBN 0312123337, p. 333
Also cited as by Bovard in the Sacramento Bee (1994)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s worse than that.  Who you vote for is irrelevant.  It has nothing to do with the people in charge.  Democracy is promoted because democracies are inherently flawed, and will always vote to redistribute wealth into the market where it can be vacuumed up by international bankers.  Always.  It is voluntary, engineered servitude.  Democracy is just the noose you use to hang yourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I wasn&#39;t clear enough. The vast majority of wars the US took part in prior to the 20th Century were on the North American continent. While the morality of these wars certainly remains questionable, they mainly served to solidify US strength in its own region of the world.</p>

<p>The wars fought by the US in the early-to-mid 20th Century on the other hand had more to do with several factors, such as US aid to Western powers having the potential to be seen as an act of war by enemies of Western Europe, as well as the potential to bolster the US economy by producing wartime materials, in addition to repercussions of US oil embargoes against Japan prior to WWII.</p>

<p>This is in contrast to the wars and &quot;police actions&quot; fought in the second half of the 20th Century to today, in that the US sought to destabilize the regions of Asia surrounding the USSR in order to prevent Russia from gaining potential footholds for expansion.</p>

<p>I forgot where exactly I was going with all of this, but now the US is stuck lying in the bed it made, with Israel as the only &quot;ally&quot; in a region that exists as it does today partly by the US meddling in foreign affairs.</p>

<p>They have been trying to overthrow Venezuelan democracy for decades. </p>

<p>They &quot;rescued&quot; the Kosovo Albanians by force even when their democratically elected Premier Ibrahim Rugova was pleading for peaceful negotiations. </p>

<p>After Japan&#39;s surrender in WWII, they dictated that the collaborationist dictatorship in South Korea should remain in place - sparking the Korean war.</p>

<p>After France&#39;s defeat in Vietnam, they overthrew the referendum results and backed a succession of dictators in Vietnam, at the cost of 50,000 American lives and over a million Vietnamese.</p>

<p>They engineered a coup against the democratically elected government of Chile then applauded decades later when democracy was &quot;restored&quot; (with no chance of communists ever coming to power again).</p>

<p>edit:  and of course there is America&#39;s favourite democracy, Israel, a democracy consciously modeled after the South African Bantustan system, but which Boers say goes way beyond the oppression of Apartheid.  Palestinians are allowed to vote there, as long as they vote for the PLO and not Hamas.</p>

<p>I am reminded of the song by Tom Lehrer <em>Send the Marines</em>  They&#39;ve got to be protected, all their rights respected, until someone we like can be elected.</p>

<p>edit: and then there is poor Ukraine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I highly highly highly doubt that the reason they push democracy over other forms of gov&#39;t is because of the control they have. Granted they have far too much control and the people with money have a much larger influence but there are many other forms of government in which the power of manipulation runs much stronger. </p>

<p>Democracy in theory gives everyone a chance at a voice. It is still one of the best governing formats in use, in theory. </p>

<p>From your stance on the manipulations of elections well that has less to do with the format of the government and more with the trustworthiness of the people working the poles and the governing body overseeing the elections. </p>

<p>The problem with our democracy is that we have large businesses and extremely wealthy people directly swaying (manipulating) the control in their favor by throwing money at the politicians. </p>
