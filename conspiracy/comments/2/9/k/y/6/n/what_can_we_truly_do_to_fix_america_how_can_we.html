<p>I doubt this will get many upvotes, but I&#39;m begging you guys, if we can make an easy way to inform the public or just anyone on what&#39;s going on, how their rights are being taken and what they can do to end corruption, maybe it could lead to a chain reaction.

    <div class="md"><p>The only way to actually start any kind of change in the US would be for the people to get together and decide to pick a large corporation and then completely and utterly boycott the shit out of them.</p>

<p>Only one. One that everyone could put 100% of their efforts into and we could bankrupt them in no time flat. But we would need to stick to our guns, we could not let little sob stories about &quot;My dad works for Nestle and is now out of job, please I have 3 little sisters&quot;...etc</p>

<p>It would only work if people realized that we were choosing one token &quot;evil&quot; corporation and bringing them down (with zero violence by the way). Full stop. </p>

<p>Because that would send a message. That is how you start to make change. You hit them where it hurts, their wallets.</p>

<p>Imagine if we bankrupted a company like Nestle. And we could do it for one reason. Just pick one of the many things that they have done to terrorize the world and say &quot;too bad, we know you did X, and this is our response&quot;. And no amount of PR, or speeches, or promise of &quot;changes&quot; on their side would be able to affect us. Nope, now Nestle is gone. Every product has been boycotted and they get dissolved away as a company.</p>

<p>Then we pick another one, possibly stronger, like Halliburton (because now that Nestle is gone, we know we have strength in numbers).</p>

<p>And we don&#39;t fucking stop until we have boycotted and picketed and done everything (non-violent) in our power to destroy that corporation.</p>

<p>And all the while, a ripple effect would be happening and all of the other companies and corporations (known for corruption) would be shitting their pants.</p>

<p>And by doing this, most importantly, people would finally realize that we CAN make a difference by putting aside parties (and all that other nonsense) and working together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am very glad the idea of boycott is finally taking hold! My short version of &quot;what to do&quot;:</p>

<ol>
<li>If money is power, why do we give it away so easily?</li>
<li>Disengage the thieves&#39; economy on all non-essential functions.</li>
<li>Deploy your limited capital today on solutions for tomorrow that require no dollar inputs.</li>
<li>Spend time with friends/family while working toward a goals.</li>
</ol>

<p>Remeber SOPA and GoDaddy? Once people started leaving, GoDaddy changed their stance to protect thier bottom line. Even though they were likely lieing - money talks, bullshit walks.</p>

<p>So what do I mean by solutions tomorrow? I like to use a garden as a simple example, but anything you need in your life. Food is just universal so... If you spend a few dollars today and your time/labor to start a garden/orchard, in the near future you will get fruit/vegetables directly for your labor, no dollars needed. No support for Monsanto.</p>

<p>People will often talk about violence, but if they can&#39;t make the simple changes like cancelling their netflix, their smartphone plan, stop going out to eat, stop buying new houses and cars and all the crap we consider &quot;middle class&quot;, well... if you can&#39;t do those simple things, do you really think you are ready to shoot other humans?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think most of the hemming and hawing people wouldn&#39;t pull the trigger; seems more like a blow-off value for pent up aggression. Don&#39;t doubt there are a lot that wouldn&#39;t hesitate though.</p>

<p>Either way, people like us have a job to do right now. Start a fire under the idea of a boycott. Period. I see it as the only way to go on the offensive.</p>

<p>If anyone wants solutions for &quot;after the boycott reckoning&quot;, I&#39;ve been pointing them toward Permaculture. My garden is having positive effects on my neighbors already in just 3 years since I started. 2 more people are growing veggies and 1 has planted fruit trees!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and in the miracle event that it did happen, the media (4th branch of the government) would do its best to turn the tables around and start broadcasting sob stories about how hurting corporation X was going to leave the so &amp; so family out in the rain, etc...</p>

<p>The most important aspect of my plan would be for the people to become ice-cold. There is going to be collateral damage as a part of every movement and we need to realize that government and corporations sure don&#39;t give a hell about us when WE are the collateral damage.</p>

<p>So we would need to have the same attitude and stay confident in the fact that the alternative would be resorting to violence and that we were taking the high road by sticking to our plan and enforcing boycotts, protest, etc... which were all non-violent.</p>

<p>And it could not work against multiple targets, that wouldn&#39;t have the same effect. It would need to be against ONE target. Like a TOKEN target. That way it would be easy for everyone to stay focused and not get distracted or torn into multiple directions.</p>

<p>JC Collins explains this quite well and the coming bankers new SDR system. He says something along the lines of awareness coming from within, unfortunately we&#39;re tethered to those who&#39;re devoid from within. All we can do is work at this point towards softening the blow and veering away from the herd cliffward trajectory which is . </p>

<p>JC Collins also explores the coming Bank of International Settlements new monetary system. His work is quite indepth and will help to give context to the shortly coming de-deolarization of the world, and gives some scope for potential investment opportunities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I love the idea of taking out Monsanto first, it would be  hard organizing farmer (mostly mega-corporations them selves) to cooperate with your cause. On the other hand If every one withdrew all their capital from Bank Of American, Citibank and JP Morgan Chase at the same time and moved it all to credit unions and small independent banks it would have a much larger effect and no one would need to actually boycott banking just simply change their bank. Yea changing your bank sucks but no one will cry for the banks.
Once they are gone,  taking our Monsanto and the energy oligarchy becomes much easier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you say we should ignore sob stories...but then don&#39;t explain what to do with the people who work there. We&#39;d destroy their jobs while the corporation sustains itself in other markets, so it&#39;d only hurt the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the corporation wouldn&#39;t &quot;sustain itself in other markets&quot;. We would attack (figuratively) until the corporation no longer existed and went bankrupt. If they were swallowed or bought up by a bigger corporation, then that would also be enough because destroying the corp in <em>name</em> and influence would be our main goal.</p>

<p>Like I said, collateral damage is going to occur no matter what. We need to stop being such pussies and realize that eggs are going to break if you want to make an omelette. That is the way of the world. Yeah, people will lose jobs at <em>that</em> corporation. Boo hoo, now it is up to them to figure it out.</p>

<p>The bigger picture (people working together to destroy a token &quot;evil&quot; corporation) trumps the collateral damage, period. I don&#39;t think anyone could disagree that this massive act of non-violent protest/activism, regardless of collateral damage, is a million times better in the long run than the collateral damage inherent in a revolution of violence.</p>

<p>What do you mean by &quot;make a difference in our country&quot;?</p>

<p>&quot;Inform the public&quot; of what? How their rights are being taken? There is a lot of information about this problem on the web and in traditional books. The information is there, you just have to wade thru it. It is not easy because it is a complex problem. </p>

<p>What can we do to end corruption? Nothing. The system is designed so that we can do nothing about the problem because the people stealing the money do not want to be caught.</p>

<p>Any time the people start to stand, the powers that be will try to beat them back down again. See how they infiltrated Occupy. We would need a long term organized effort by a new political force like the Greens or the Socialists or something like the Tea Party. It will not be easy to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is what I think. </p>

<p>Number one refuse the state to educate our children. You made them therefore you educate them. Too much of the population takes children&#39;s education for granted. Did you know that most kids graduating know how to do complex equations.  Yet they were never tought basic skills such as how to balance a checkbook. </p>

<p>Educate your kids is all.</p>

<p>Next we dont vote for next election. Write no confidence. It dont matter who you think will make better choices or anything you want to belive. Presidency is a sock puppet. They have all been since Kennedy.  Live with it cause its true. None will go against what they are told cause they get a taste of the power. Well what they think is power and know they will get a bullet thru the dome if they defy the ptb. </p>

<p>Lastly fuck it all dont go to work. Just dont. Fuck paying bills. Fuck spending money. Refuse everything you are expected to do. All of it except obligations to your family. You can grow food. Raise fish in your swimming pool.  Walk or bike to where you have to go. Or even buy a horse and buggy. </p>

<p>Make it instead. Just refuse the way they say you should do anything. Trust me they cant shut off everyone&#39;s power and water. They cant. If they do research online and find out how to turn that shit back on. </p>

<p>Defy all social responsibility you have. It will impact those around you and get you noticed. Once it does explain yourself. People will listen and begin to do the same. Start with kids as media does. I mean on average right now once a month we have a school weapon incident.  Who&#39;s to say the school their kids go to wont be the next. </p>

<p>Ask them if they know the principals name. The schools phone number. How many kids are in each class there child is in. Then ask if they know what the plan is at the school in case of emergency.  Make them realize the amount of control they have given up. It will ring home I promise. </p>

<p>If no kids ask them why they go to work everyday. If its to pay bills then why do they think that is necessary.  If because they wont have money then say why is your time so worthless then. Ask if it was then why do you feel the need to further your education? </p>

<p>Keep asking questions but steer them where you want so they realize it on their own. People are inherently stupid and love to be controlled. Dont belive me then why do we always in the end refer to god? Why cant you just say nope I fucked up just let me die. No most the world wants to belive they are important and there is a plan for them. Pffff no you are not anymore then me or anyone else.</p>

<p>Religion is the oldest form of control. Be done with it. Raise awareness in your community thru intelligence. Make them feel smart its easier that way and so much more successful.  To begin I movement you will need an army if you will. Cookies and coffee wont get you much. Flattery will. </p>

<p>The fastest way to demoralize an enemy is hunger It will be the end game the powers that be will do to the rest of us. So be ready. I have seen real hunger it makes the worst things humanity can offer. Also be ready with water. </p>

<p>These are some steps but trust me they will work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. If anything, a massive protest <em>against</em> voting would cause the world to finally see that US citizens were growing a backbone.</p>

<p>If people refused to vote, then whoever came into office would not be seen as legitimate because it would be clear that the average voter had decided that the system was broken.</p>

<p>People on all sides of the political spectrum would finally have something in common and nobody would feel the need to &quot;defend their candidate&quot; because the candidate would be nobodies candidate, just some asshole who got into office due to winning the vote that (if done correctly) 90% of the country or more had not participated in.</p>

<p>During the next 4 years the non-voters could hold rallies, not based on parties, but based on the idea that they system itself were broken and that only by working together could we develop a new system.</p>

<p>Other countries would gain a small ounce of respect the average US citizen for refusing to participate in the complete sham that is our &quot;democratic elections&quot;. And when the president/congress/etc.. went around warmongering, people would know that they were doing it themselves and not based on what the voters wanted.</p>

<p>But this will probably never happen because some assholes always have to come out and make up a bunch of BS about &quot;voting is your voice&quot; and blah blah blah... As I am sure someone will respond to this comment with.</p>

<p>The system is literally so corrupt, that if &quot;not voting&quot; gained momentum to the point that it could actually work as a means of protest, the corrupt forces in control (both political sides) would sponsor a massive campaign to trick people back into it.</p>

<p>Not to mention that the major figures who would lead the &quot;don&#39;t vote&quot; revolution would quickly end up dead.</p>
