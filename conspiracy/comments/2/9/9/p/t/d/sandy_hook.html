<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What does this do to the audience who has been following the narrative on television? It sets up a flicker effect. An hour ago, it was suspect in the woods. Now, that bit of data is gone. On-off switch. It was on, now it’s off.</p>

<p>This is a break in logic. It makes no sense.</p>

<p>Which is the whole point.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this short essay on how the MSM tells a story is well worth reading, explains how the technique works.</p>

<p>it doesn&#39;t matter that a story is illogical and wrong, the story get adapted and morphed as it goes along, eventually an official story is constructed and that is the truth, no matter that it is likely complete BS.</p>

<p>US national elections follow in a similar vein, some company is contracted (by the MSM) to tally and disseminate the total vote, their tally becomes the official vote and accepted outcome, no matter that the real votes can be obfuscated and twisted, once the moment the contracting vote company says X won, the parties accept it, that is it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s simply not true. Those questions have been answered multiple times. They are horribly misleading and really show how unprofessional the person asking them is. Here is a link that is 3 months old. No idea why you are claiming no one will answer the questions.</p>

<p>forget the fancy over complex shite (who were the crisis actors, we know they used them, we know the kids are alive and older), its simple questions and answers that will get the legal wheels in motion.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just incorrect. From 10:00 to 10:03 on the police radio, you can hear them call for all available ambulances. That&#39;s 20 to 25 minutes after the shooting. That&#39;s also when 2 of the children were transported to Danbury Hospital.</p>

<p>According to the police reports, paramedics checked each of the victims 4 times, including once with an EKG.</p>

<p>How many different people did you count when you added up all the people from the different photos, videos, and aerial shots? It was surely hundreds. And most of the people were <em>inside</em> the firehouse. So ... I&#39;m not sure where you&#39;re going with this.</p>

<p>we saw a photo of one special ed class being <em>&#39;evacuated&#39;</em> from the drill the day or so before, theres the MSM photo then theres the other photo showing the parents and local journalists standing there watching the kids being <em>&#39;evacuated&#39;</em></p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/EslskvO.png">ONE picture tells a fairy story, TWO pictures tell the full story</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why you say that one of the photos is a &quot;special ed class&quot; or a &quot;drill&quot;. </p>

<p>These are pictures of more children being evacuated than I have seen from any other school shooting. There are hundreds of other pictures and videos, too, from the firehouse. Did you expect them to all line up for a group shot?</p>

<p>what time and on what day.</p>

<p>its a bit pointless to do so hours later or the next day. trauma victims have to be seen immediately, otherwise theres no point in bothering. they die on you before you get to them.</p>

<p>and we know that EMTs and paramedics were not in the school on the morning of the 14th, the aerial video shows no EMTs there, they were ALL down at the firehouse or way down the parking lot playing triage with empty plastic sheets.</p>

<p>The prevailing theory is that the Sandy Hook shooting never happened, that kids never died, and the motive was gun control. After this hoax was exposed, people started questioning other incidents including the Port Arthur Massacre in Australia which was one of several high-profile shootings that helped grease the skids for gun control in Australia. Miraculously, there havent been any more high-profile shootings in Australia ever since the gun control agenda was accomplished</p>
