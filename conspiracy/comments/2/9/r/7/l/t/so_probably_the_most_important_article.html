        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">182</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2014-07-03 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/jcamp41.html">jcamp41</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There&#39;s one fact that should be ingrained in all the minds of all Americans who experienced 9/11, just like the images of the crumbling towers that fateful day, and that is the fact that 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi Nationals. Not Iraqis, not Afghanis, and not Persians. </p>

<p><strong><em>Saudis</em></strong>...and well connected ones at that. </p>

<p>Also remember that Saudi Arabia is not like any other country. You know where common citizens go about their day to day,  work a 9 to 5, and come home and pay a mortgage. If your middle class or wealthier in that country, and native, you have some kind of connection to the royal family. </p>

<p>With all that being said, everyone in this community who&#39;s been on top of the Sarasota connection to 9/11, the Saudis, and the Bush Administration need to keep the pressure on the media, politicians, and the public to not gloss over what happened in that city in Florida two weeks prior to 911 as well as the reasons for Bush&#39;s coincidental and infamous presence at Emma E Booker Elementary on 9/11. </p>

<p>Sarasota is not some whack-a-doodle conspiratorial lynch pin either. If it were then there&#39;s no reason<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/29o8lr/"> this top ranked post from last night going into detail about Sarasota&#39;s role in 9/11 should have been deleted</a> and also remember there have been two lawmakers who saw the revelations that were just released in the aforementioned article above for years now, and they must be continued to be questioned and prodded : </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://nypost.com/2013/12/15/inside-the-saudi-911-coverup/">A pair of lawmakers who recently read the redacted portion say they are “absolutely shocked” at the level of foreign state involvement in the attacks. Reps. Walter Jones \(R-NC\) and Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) can’t reveal the nation identified by it without violating federal law. So they’ve proposed Congress pass a resolution asking President Obama to declassify the entire 2002 report.
</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, in light of the recent events involving ISIS, and the possibility that Saudi Arabia&#39;s former intelligent director, Prince Bandar, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/19/saudi-arabia-rejects-iraqi-accusations-isis-support">here</a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/19/saudi-arabia-rejects-iraqi-accusations-isis-support">here</a>, we cannot forget his role and his wife&#39;s role in the funding of 9/11, whether voluntarily or involuntarily (yeah right). His connections to terror networks were so obvious that in 2004 Riggs Bank of Washington dropped the Saudis as clients. Yet Prince Bandar or &quot;Bandar Bush&quot; as he&#39;s been lovingly called--due to his cozy relationship with the Bush&#39;s--was kept on as Saudi intelligence chief up until just a few months ago. </p>

<p>Since I knew part of the redacted 9/11 report was going to be reported this week I posted what I perceived as a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/28trei/why_does_google_hide_the_image_search_option_for/">soft form of censorship by Google with one of the key players in Sarasota in the running up to 9/11</a> where Google doesn&#39;t list &quot;images&quot; as one of the default search options of this guy (which I admit could be an innocent algorithmic quirk) </p>

<p>Zainelabdeen Ibrahim Omer is the real name of a person who went filed a police report with Sarasota police a few days before 9/11 and coinciding with Bush&#39;s visit that week that someone he knew as &quot;Gandi&quot; had threatened to kill the president. Either his claim was true or a red herring that would&#39;ve made it seem like Bush&#39;s connection to Sarasota, 9/11, and the family that fled <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2014/07/01/13/38/11y0GE.Em.56.JPG">this home</a>  was an overreaching plot that targeted U.S. institutions, including the president. Yet all of these happenings have sunk into the memory hole and Mr. Omer continues to travel the world free and clear, but know one knows where the hell this guy is, even though there have been auxiliary players of 9/11 with less nefarious ties to the incident who were held in custody since. </p>

<p>The Saudi connection to 9/11 runs too deep and has been willfully ignored by the MSM and kept at arms length and away from the minds of the majority of Americans. All the American public associates with 9/11 is Afghanistan, Iraq, and the tragic consequences of that day. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no reason why the Sarasota article should&#39;ve been deleted. There&#39;s no reason why Saudi involvement should&#39;ve been redacted from the 9/11 report. There&#39;s no reason why the Bush administration should&#39;ve assisted members of the Saudi royal family out of the U.S. after 9/11. </p>

<p>So please...KEEP THE PRESSURE ON. </p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;d like to thank <a href="/u/worthless_meatsack">/u/worthless_meatsack</a> for providing some much needed homework that I should&#39;ve included in my original post. </p>

<p>It is in regards to<a href="https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-resolution/428"> H.Res.428 or House Resolution 428 Urging the president to release information regarding the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks upon the United States.</a></p>

<p>This was the bill introduced by Walter B. Jones Jr. (R-NC) after analyzing the redacted 7,200 word portion of the 9/11 report alongside Stephen D Lynch (D-Mass) which highlights possible and overt Saudi involvement in the events that led to 9/11. </p>

<p>I copied <a href="/u/worthless_meatsacks">/u/worthless_meatsacks</a>&#39; list of congressman who currently reside on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, who Walter B Jones Jr. (R-NC) currently resides on, as the first point of inquiry if you wish to make sure this bill passes, making sure Americans are rightfully informed as to other possible motives and players that were possibly involved in the most heinous attack on U.S. soil since the attack on Pearl Harbor. Before you write your representative, please keep in mind and realize the words that came out from Walter B Jones Jr and Stephen D Lynch after reading the redacted portions of the 9/11 report : </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A pair of lawmakers who recently read the redacted portion say they are “absolutely shocked” at the level of foreign state involvement in the attacks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These aren&#39;t some conspiracy nutter&#39;s words, but the direct words from elected officials (bi-partisan, I might add) who are currently working with one of our nation&#39;s most influential intelligence committees. </p>

<p>So here&#39;s the list along with links to each of the representative&#39;s avenues of contact. Good luck and hopefully we start to apply much needed pressure to make sure H.Res.428 is passed and noticed by the MSM and the public at large. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s make this an issue. Contact your representative below NOW!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The momentum of a social movement works both ways.  With the proper leverage, those very idiots will readily blaze away at the actual guilty parties.  You&#39;re describing mob mentality in the face of an apparent threat, not a lack of virtue (although that is also arguable).  As that threat was fraudulent, and tailor-made to fit the culture, your conclusions are overbroad.  Also, there were shit tons of protests, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post%E2%80%93September_11_anti-war_movement">ANSWER, NION, UFPJ, within 20 days of 911</a>.  Blame lies with our representatives for failing to act in our best interests after the attack, and likely with select representatives (and citizens) in the perpetration of the fraud.  It&#39;s impossible not to agree with your sentiment though.  I expect that very soon you&#39;ll have an appropriate target for that sentiment.</p>

<p>This was one of the articles that I read.

    <div class="md"><p>This seems crazy to me: The official narrative is that OBL and AQ perpetrated 9/11 alone, with no state-sponsorship, and here we have, 28 pages (the section specifically about &quot;Foreign state sponsorship of 9/11&quot;) is redacted in its entirety, with two Congressmen who have read it saying it is absolutely shocking; If OBL and AQ did it alone, why would this section be <em>completely</em> redacted? Lots of people believe lots of things about 9/11, but the only theory that fits with the evidence is that the official narrative is incomplete or incorrect. If it is true, that the Saudi&#39;s, or whoever else, had a hand in sponsorship of the attack, it should be known.</p>

<p>Edit: I did a bit &#39;o Google and found H.Res.428. It was introduced to the House on 12/02/2013 by Walter Jones (R. NC-3) and currently is in the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The name of the report is the &quot;Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 2001.&quot; Quite a mouthful. The following representatives are on the Intelligence committee, and are in the best position to move the issue forward:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mike Rogers (R. MI) Chariman</li>
<li>Mac Thornberry (R. TX)</li>
<li>Jeff Miller (R. FL)</li>

<li>Ed Pastor (D. AZ)</li>
<li>Jim Himes (D. CT)</li>
<li>Terri Sewell (D. AL)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the letter I sent:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear Congress Critter,</p>

<p>I believe the President should declassify the 28-page section concerned with foreign-state support of 9/11 in the Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 2001. I ask that you support House Resolution 428, sponsored by Rep. Walter Jones.</p>

<p>I see that it has been referred to the Intelligence Committee upon which you are a member, so I expect that you are in a unique position to provide support for and insight into HR428. I believe transparency and justice are important principles that are crucial to the values of our democracy, a view which I hope you share. Please let me know your position on this legislation so that I may hopefully support you in your bid for reelection this November.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time,</p>

<p>Worthless Meatsack</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honestly I can&#39;t see myself supporting him for reelection, he&#39;s a real scumball and I hardly ever vote for incumbents, but he doesn&#39;t need to know that.</p>

<p>Edit 2: A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MHFIZXFgnM">press confrence</a> from former Sen. Bob Graham. So sad that it only has 475 views. No wonder this country is in the condition it is. Here is another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEOF7wCIudA">press confrence about H.Res.428</a> from Representatives Massie, Lynch and Jones. I think it is quite telling what Rep. Lynch says about the removed chapter. He suggested that the information it contained would be instructive for the wider Congress to know in future foreign policy decision. That, to me, seems like a very important reason to declassify this material.</p>

<p>This is untrue.  The official story, which is now on it&#39;s third iteration, has always included a state-sponsor.  </p>

<p>1) AQ with assistance from Afghanistan.

3) AQ with assistance from Iran</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Help me fill in what the &quot;official story&quot; is because I&#39;m probably not fully versed in it. My recollection is that after 9/11, AQ was deemed responsible, and Afghanistan/Taliban refused to turn them over, so the Afganistan war began. Before 9/11, cooperation between AQ and the Taliban was limited; does the Taliban&#39;s refusal to cooperate with US demands after 9/11 count as state sponsorship of the attack itself? Then FUD, misinfo, and disinfo occurred and suddenly people thought Iraq was responsible as well, cue the Iraq War. At various points Iran has been attempted to be linked to 9/11 although I haven&#39;t seen as much of that or atleast their attempts are less successful; Clearly there has been no overt Iranian War. What state or states are fingered in the missing pages of the report? If it isn&#39;t one of those three, and it appears not to be judging by the statements of a few politicians who have seen it, it would certainly be a new development.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t seem like being involved with the actual attack is the criteria.  Iran is alleged, and convicted, of being involved with AQ before and after 9/11, but it doesn&#39;t say during...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>World changing event is related to this exact story. The FBI may be able to calm the waters, but IDK how they would at this point. </p>

<p>I&#39;m working on this story to the Nth degree. I ask that everyone please check out my post from yesterday. I have more info coming. I am backing stuff as I find it using a friend and a flash drive. Today, I made hardcopies of information. This is a rabbit hole. The &quot;news flash&quot; of this whole thing is linked by my original comment. It&#39;s still there (miamiherald.com). Please read this post completely. I&#39;m going to put my points of concern and haste below. Its not good.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/29prwb/new_911_info_from_wait_a_minute_something_isnt/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/29prwb/new_911_info_from_wait_a_minute_something_isnt/</a></p>

<p>Please answer any of the following here on in a private message:</p>

<p>1) The Miami Herald - Is this a circulating print? Is it well received or sourced in the Miami area?</p>

<p>2) What is the public perception of the editor/founder of browardbulldog.org? </p>

<p>3) If you live in the south FL, have never heard of browardbulldog.org (and founder), miamiherald.com, and/or consider yourself fairly well eclectic in news sources, please tell me so.</p>

<p>4) Anything worth mentioning is info I want.</p>

<p>5) Can someone look into the two aforementioned sites and find out the nerd end of the info for me (example info I want: server, website created date, owner(s), web traffic, sister sites, or anything that is odd? There is something to be found. I&#39;m sure of it.</p>

<p>Ok, this is my concern (and some of this can be found in my thread link above, and the <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> link I put in the above post. Some of this is speculation on my part (but it works TOO GOOD), some of it hard fact, and some is disappearing as the OP put it. </p>

<p>1) miamiherald.com AND browerbulldog.org are part of the same entity.</p>

<p>2) The evolution of the alleged new documents was this FBI&gt;Broward Bulldog&gt; Miami Herald&gt; Reddit front page (<a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>)</p>

<p>3) Just <em>days</em> before Broward Bulldog received FBI info, they post an article accusing the FBI of lying about having info regarding Sarasota Saudi. The attack was in 2001. The odds of bitching about the legality of FBI telling lies about having documents just days before they hand them over says volumes. <a href="http://www.browardbulldog.org/2014/06/down-the-rabbit-hole-with-the-fbi-saying-911-documents-dont-exist-when-they-do/">http://www.browardbulldog.org/2014/06/down-the-rabbit-hole-with-the-fbi-saying-911-documents-dont-exist-when-they-do/</a></p>

<p>4)Dan Christensen, the founder and editor of browardbulldog.org had MANY things to be found via google search- YESTERDAY. The top three links were from angry folks that caught Christensen fabricating email conversations between himself and a fake person (also Dan Christensen). This was discovered because of its sloppiness. He used his name to register the fake email address, but failed to realize that his first and last name were viewable to the public. This is basically how the fake conversation went:</p>

<p>DC- I&#39;ve already told you, I&#39;m not CIA or anything else</p>

<p>FAKE- Yes you are. I&#39;ve already sent you my evidence</p>

<p>DC- Attached is proof I&#39;m not CIA and that your info is incorrect. Please stop.</p>

<p>FAKE- Well, I just don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>And that was about it. No attachments to view. The google search links that portrayed him as a CIA agent/operative were the majority of the first page links. Only one other person named Dan Christensen was on the first page of links. That person is/was a artist and the link was to Wikipedia (it was about 5th or 6th on the page) The second page of yesterday, looks almost like the first page today. I was finding things disappear last night. With that sort of urgency, I tried to mentally retain as much info as possible with regards to as many different elements as I could find. He is 100% CIA or similar agent. I also found facebook links via google regarding Dan Christensen. All of which have several bad things to say about him including naming him CIA. </p>

<p>5) JUST FOUND: This is also part of it albeit a different template. All of these recent articles by Dan the man. The purpose of &quot;INN&quot; seems to be to legitimize, offer support for, and publish articles for alternative news source. I haven&#39;t had time to dig yet. I looked at a few mugshots of the staff. The metatags match up. But that&#39;s all I know at this time. I haven&#39;t looked at any of the other members. Perhaps Dan has some real cred with a site that&#39;s namesake suggests they take investigation seriously. WTF do I know?</p>

<p><a href="http://investigativenewsnetwork.org/member/broward-bulldog/">http://investigativenewsnetwork.org/member/broward-bulldog/</a></p>

<p>There is just a smidgen of it all. Like I said, I&#39;m going to get to the bottom of it. I DO want your help. I tried to get the help of the OP of the front page with a couple of things. No response yet, but I am not going to get too worked up over it. Perhaps, nobody else realized what this could be leading up to, so I wouldn&#39;t expect such a vested intensity. Here is what I said in the private message:</p>

<p>&quot;I hope you do not mistake my curiosity for an accusation, but given that you posted the miamiherald.com link regarding Sarasota, I was hoping you can clear up a couple of things for me. </p>

<p>Are you Dan Christensen, an associate of his, or part of Broward Bulldog in any capacity?</p>

<p>If not, what led you to the Miami Herald site? Why not just use the source? Are you from Southern FL or close enough to the paper route for the Miami Herald, to were you could confirm its legitimacy and scale of distribution? </p>

<p>If not any of that jazz, are you connected to US government or Israeli (even Zionist) players? I don&#39;t care what you do. I just want to understand, your motives for the OP. If this is a deflection move/or some sort of cointel, it is real flimsy. The lack of any new information, and the observations made in Sarasota suggest a staged house or a FBI extraction to a safe house. If you want a conspiracy theory, here is another possibility- This missing Saudi guy is a terrorist cell handler with a personal contact to at least one &quot;Bush Dynasty&quot; business/political associates. The family could have thought that the feds were showed up because of a security threat. Instead, they went to the swamp. Of course, I just see that as a possibility (and movie script lol), but I&#39;m not too close to any ideology. Thought I&#39;d mess with you a smidge. That site is messing with me. I hate the layout. That is actually what made me question it&quot;</p>

<p>With these odd sources, the Broward Bulldog having a founder that doesn&#39;t have much integrity according to FB users, blogs, and yesterday&#39;s google search.</p>

<p><a href="/u/jcamp41">/u/jcamp41</a> Please feel free to source anything that I have on the subject. Feel free to message me if you have things you would like to bounce around. Anyone here really, please. And below is my reasoning for the calls of teamwork, participation, and time. </p>

<p>*<strong><em>SUMMARY FOR THOSE THAT SKIM</em></strong>*</p>

<p>By way of fake or sleazy, less-than-honest media/source(s), the FBI has NEW partially redacted docs that claims a wanted and missing Saudi man with direct 9/11 terrorist, came back to the US, went to three states (NC, TX, CA) and then left. In my estimation the feds killed him on or before October 31, 2001 because he was a terrorist cell handler, and his contact was most likely part of the Bush White House, the &quot;House of Bush&quot;, or US intel. The evidence in the Sarasota home suggests that the family was evacuated because the terrorist cell had received their orders already thus completing the handlers work. But the evacuation was in haste suggesting a &quot;threat&quot; was made. The FBI or similar feds would have picked the family up, taken them somewhere secure, executed all of them, and destroyed the bodies. Its like this- you have to eliminate the link in a conspiracy to keep the top level people safe (mafia movie 101). </p>

<p>So, why would the fed&#39;s bring this new shit to light? The new info, with its missing names is manipulative for the audience. Its the only way they can try to deflect a SMOKING GUN involving the Sarasota Saudi and a connection to Bush (if not him, some other big shot) directly to 9/11. What smoking gun? IDK, but the FBI just stopped a Snowden file that &quot;was being released ahead of schedule to prevent war&quot; until those particular Snowden file trustees have time to review &quot;new information&quot; given to them by the FBI. I do not know what that could be. If Bush or senior members of that administration are tied to 9/11,  things may get rocky for us. The Snowden evidence, that is obviously important, may prove the execution or (if he is alive) extraction of this Saudi terrorist handler from the US by the feds OR the Saudi is about to become a patsy. A cover-up using that guy as the perp for US actions here or abroad may also be the new farce. I can only speculate. I hope I have real time to sift thru everything soon. There are other aspects and possibilities, but for now- just this.</p>

<p>tl;dr A NEW 9/11 smoking gun and the scramble to cover it up is a possibility if you look at the evidence and recent actions of certain people.</p>
