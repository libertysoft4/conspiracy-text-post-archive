<p>If my observation is wanted: Right now there is much &quot;<em>hope and faith</em>&quot; in the emergence of internal understanding in which these contested systems and <em>entities</em> may be redeemed. There is perception of great opportunity for all if some <em>sacrifice</em> what they cannot and do not have control over.</p>

<p>We know that some leaks have been of things done in response to Snowden, after he no longer had access…  and we have been told that other leaks were not part of Snowden&#39;s material.  We <em>don&#39;t</em> know how many more people with access have grown a conscience, but the minimum number is one.  This is encouraging.  &quot;The NSA&quot; is seen as an agency gone rogue against its own people, but it&#39;s staffed by those people it works against, and some of them may not have been corrupted.  Hopefully there are enough good people working at a bad job to fight it from within to bring the monster down.</p>
