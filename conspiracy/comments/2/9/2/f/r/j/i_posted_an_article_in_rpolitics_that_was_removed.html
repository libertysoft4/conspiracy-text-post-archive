<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/290a7l/the_us_government_spends_over_5000_on_each/cigj3ti">Second top comment</a> deflects blame from Walmart, and shifts it to the state of the economy.</p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/28xwb9/how_walmarts_low_wages_cost_all_americans_not/">My post</a> that was deleted for being &quot;Off Topic.&quot;</p>

<p>Though both posts point to the same article, the title in the new post was changed. Changing titles to fit a narrative is against the rules, but the post wasn&#39;t removed.</p>

<p>So the question is: Why was this post allowed to remain up while another identical post was removed for being &quot;Off Topic?&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to be rude, but you can&#39;t just say something like that without providing evidence.</p>

<p>If anything, transparency is going <em>down</em> because <a href="/u/emr1028">/u/emr1028</a> was added as a moderator at <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that is a conflict of interest, and I don&#39;t really know anything about what&#39;s going on there. He didn&#39;t discuss that move with us, and we haven&#39;t talked to him about it yet as far as I know. He&#39;s a relatively new (a month?) moderator here. </p>

<p>Transparency: </p>

<p>Our rules are all publicly posted. They weren&#39;t before. </p>

<p>We have a wiki with all domain removal reasons documented. </p>

<p>We post comments or flair on every removed article. </p>

<p>We vote on each change to policy, and don&#39;t make changes until a formal vote has been taken. Each time there&#39;s a change, the publicly accessible wiki is updated to reflect it. </p>

<p>Those are significant changes that have increased the transparency massively from the &#39;old days&#39;. There&#39;s no inner workings; everything is posted up for all to see. If there are inconsistencies, that is purely the work of the human element, moderator training (Half of the staff are newer-ish) or simple differences in opinion on how to apply the rules. These inconsistencies are always on our mind and we are constantly working to make everything more uniform as we go.</p>

<p>One last question: What are the steps involved in adding a new moderator to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> ? </p>

<p>Is there a background check of his account?

<p>Post histories can be completely fabricated though. If I posted in <a href="/r/TwoXChromosomes">/r/TwoXChromosomes</a> for six months you could reasonably assume I was female.</p>

<p>It would be <em>incredibly</em> easy to crate a neutral post history and portray myself as somebody who would moderate without bias.</p>

<p><em>That</em> is why I don&#39;t trust the moderators, and believe that moderator logs should be public instead of private. I also believe users should be able to democratically vote out moderators who abuse their power.</p>

<p>In response to your second statement, police forces aren&#39;t democracies either and yet even they have (limited) repercussions to their actions.  I would say it isn&#39;t a stretch to consider mods like the police force of Reddit.  Is it too much to ask that a lazy/shitty/corrupt mod be able to be stripped of their influence/authority?  If you honestly can&#39;t see the necessity of those types of measures, you aren&#39;t fit for any sort of authority to begin with.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not devastated. I just think it&#39;s a shitty system which doesn&#39;t allow most of its members to have a say in what content gets to the front page or not. I don&#39;t even have an account there, I was put off by the vote rigging and the fact that the entire site is run by members of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> so it seems a bit like an echo chamber.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guys, if you don&#39;t know by now this site is a farce, there really isn&#39;t much left the admins and (many of the) mods can do to show you.</p>

<p>Like America has(had) the illusion of freedom, there exists the illusion of democracy on Reddit.  As Frank Zappa once said, the illusion is no longer profitable:</p>

<p>“The illusion of freedom will continue as long as it&#39;s profitable to continue the illusion. At the point where the illusion becomes too expensive to maintain, they will just take down the scenery, they will pull back the curtains, they will move the tables and chairs out of the way and you will see the brick wall at the back of the theater.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would give gold for this if i could for the Zappa quote.</p>

<p>Being somewhat new, i don&#39;t know or haven&#39;t had enough experience to see or form an opinion of subversion on Reddit. However, since it is basically a totally open forum. And nefarious  intentions could proliferate here easily. If the CIA or whoever wanted to start a massive disinformation campaign, which the odds are there probably already is somewhere on this site. Then nothing can stop that really.</p>

<p>I have been of the opinion lately that while the internet has seemingly made us &quot;more free&quot; as a global community as a whole or at least opened the doors to conversation, education and brought people together. It is easily more likely that it could be turned against us.</p>

<p>Without constant exhaustive research on topics, and information found on the internet. We really have no way to tell what is true or half true, or biased or utterly false. Most people don&#39;t have the time for that, and those who would want to spread disinformation for an agenda know that. </p>

<p>Our governments know and in fact rely on the basic ignorance of the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, we aren&#39;t. We&#39;re running this place exponentially more transparently, consistently, and appropriately than it was being run a year ago. </p>

<p>That warning was legit. Don&#39;t insult people or you&#39;ll be banned. That&#39;s on the sidebar. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve actually been gaining subscribers from time to time in the last month or two which is a marked improvement for an ex-default. </p>

<p>Honestly, had I thought it could be resolved by sending you a modmail I would have done that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why you wouldn&#39;t think commenting on a mistake via modmail wouldn&#39;t have been immediately resolved. We do that every single day in modmail. </p>
