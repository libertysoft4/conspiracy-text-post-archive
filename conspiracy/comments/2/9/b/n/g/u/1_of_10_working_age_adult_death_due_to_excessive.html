    <div class="md"><p>Who says you have to smoke it? I had crippling back pain after seriously fucking my back up a couple years back. Got a prop card, got medical MJ. As an ex-smoker I didn&#39;t want to mess with smoking, so I stuck to THC pills. Worked great, I was able to rest and function (was on medical leave, so no driving or office time required) and after the pain went away after 3 months, so did the need for the weed. I&#39;m not a recreational user (nor am I much of a drinker, shit makes cig cravings come back hard), but if I ever have a major pain issue again, I&#39;d go back on THC pills in a heartbeat over codeine or any other pharma-shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>gotta remember people can drink heavily to cope with other problems, not just because they like being drunk 24/7 or all their spare time.</p>

<p>back pain, arthritis, cancer and even maybe heart conditions, emotional problems, the aging process and a persons looming mortality.</p>

<p>and of course to feel good.</p>

<p>many reasons why people drink heavily and suffer the delayed consequences.</p>

<p>maybe some are making the right choice, drink be happy and go early, and avoid lingering pain and misery in the declining years..</p>

<p>and example of social pressures, over in Britain up to the 90s maybe, there was this lingering old school puritan mindset, partly social, partly BBC and other media and partly medical and social service types.</p>

<p>they were of the comfortable middle class opinion that drink (and drugs) and enjoying oneself was bad for you, morally wrong and would cost the taxpayer millions in NHS costs, lots and lots of public service announcements and BBC TV moralizing on good behavior and how the the poor were miserable irresponsible layabouts who drank too much and didn&#39;t look after themselves.</p>

<p>of course the well off types can afford to be smug and live the uptight good life (in public at least) they don&#39;t have to worry about unemployment and poverty and shite housings, finding money every week to feed and clothe their families.</p>

<p>and of course this social programming is hard to break out from, it peculates and influences whole generations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am sure people here know alcohol is a toxic poison that destroys the liver, but even deeper... </p>

<p>Alcohol is natures way to euthanize starving creatures. The fruit on the ground rots &amp; in nature alcohol/rotting fruit smells not often [if ever] pleasant, but creatures that had been eating the fruit before it stopped falling sometimes if hungry enough then return &amp; eat the foul fruit as a last resort in attempt to stave off hunger. Sometimes this is due to other diseases &amp; an animal may be seeking to end pain or suffering, but most often it is likely due to hunger &amp; starvation that an animal resorts to eating the rotting ground fruit mash [often full of bugs too]. If they do not die &amp; find some healthy food to last another year sometimes they eat the rotting fruit even if not starving due to the &quot;spirits&quot; of the dead calling them to it from the vibrations in the odors interacting with brain cells. I once lived for many years feral in an area with mango &amp; other fruit trees that dropped tons of fruit seasonally &amp; I have witnessed what I write about first hand with birds mice rats cats &amp; goats. </p>

<p>Hangover? seems your BBC TV &lt;---o_0 implanted non reality. Could you provide a source for the hangovers in elephants?</p>

<p>Because facts I find seem to indicate elephants are too large to receive much an alcoholic effect @ all from rotting fruit to make them merry apparently according to the non film makers BBC I found here:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><em>The non bushmen</em> locals are often ignorant &amp; ill educated alike sometimes people who shit on the words of out of the box thinkers who cared enough to share intelligence &amp; deeper insights than are often provided by <strong>MSM programming</strong> based BBC slime box ooze BS ignorance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140528-do-animals-take-drugs?utm_source=rss&amp;amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;amp;utm_campaign=do-animals-like-drugs-and-alcohol">As for the elephants, the science is pretty clear. The animals are so massive that it would take a tremendous amount of the marula fruit to become intoxicated. Physiologists Steve Morris, David Humphreys, and Dan Reynolds of the University of Bristol first heard the rumours of the drunk elephants while in South Africa for a scientific conference, so they set about determining whether the legends might reflect some truth. A search of the scientific literature supported the notion that elephants could at least become drunk. A 1984 study showed that they were happy to drink up a 7% alcohol solution, and several drank enough to alter their behaviour. While they didn&#39;t &quot;act drunk&quot;, in human terms, they decreased the time spent feeding, drinking, bathing, and exploring, and became more lethargic. Several displayed behaviours that indicated they were uncomfortable, or perhaps slightly ill. Drunk trunk? But just because elephants can become intoxicated doesn&#39;t mean that they do it in the wild routinely enough to inspire all the marula tree legends. A 3,000kg (6,600lb) elephant would have to drink between 10 and 27 litres of a 7% alcohol solution in a relatively short amount of time to experience any overt behavioural changes. Even if marula fruit contained 3% ethanol (a generous estimate) an elephant eating only marula fruits at a normal pace would barely consume half the alcohol necessary in a single day to become drunk. If it wanted to get drunk, given the constraints of its anatomy and physiology, an elephant would have to eat marula fruit at 400% its normal feeding rate while also eschewing all additional water intake. &quot;On our analysis,&quot; the researchers conclude, &quot;this seems extremely unlikely.&quot; Still, something must explain the unusual behaviour of elephants around marula trees. Morris, Humphreys, and Reynolds offer two possible explanations. First, their unusually aggressive behaviour may simply reflect the fruit&#39;s status as a highly prized food item. A second, more intriguing hypothesis, is that there&#39;s another intoxicant that they&#39;re consuming. In addition to the fruits, elephants also sometimes eat the tree’s bark. This often contains beetle pupae, which contain a substance that local Africans historically used to poison their arrow tips. If they were ingesting the beetle toxin, perhaps that could explain the unusual antics of the pachyderms.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the occasions they do get drunk from humans alcohol they are not seemingly merry:</p>

<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2583891.stm">killed 6 humans</a></p>

<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3423881.stm">caused them commit suicide</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/482001.stm">killed 4 destroyed a village</a></p>

<p>All from the BBC it seems that if elephants get a taste of alcohol enough to produce a hangover they would most often likely rampage kill others &amp; suicide as opposed to act merry. The fact that they drew an electrocution suicidal death speaks volumes to as what spirits they had <em>tapped</em> into known to the wise as the spirits of the lonely hungry dead seeking to draw company to their realm of ill sad suffering nature snuffed souls.</p>

<p>wise not to trust the BBC much.</p>

<p>years back when Simon King was the darling of the new generation of wildlife documentary producers, his show on the swans, they had a beaut of a continuity error with the adult swans and their cygnets (numbers), likely two different families of swans on the/a river.</p>
