<p>An example would be with cymatics where speaking a word or sound would produce a shape in the medium (most often sand) that matches the letter used in that language to represent that sound.</p>

<p>This, along with cymatics in general, is extremely fascinating to me but I can&#39;t seem to find any solid information about any of it. If anyone has any resources I&#39;d love to see them.</p>

<p>Exact same thought I had. How is this not a HUGE scientific field? What are the practical applications? It seems insane to me that this is something that appears to be entirely ignored.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And this seems to be a culmination of religious, mythological and scientific knowledge in modern times. Quantum/string theory shows us that everything gets fuzzy the smaller we go. We live in a sea of quantum fluctuations. The idea that everything is a vibration seems to make sense.</p>

<p>I wish I could find it but there was a video about how every word for god in every language involves the sound &quot;ahhh&quot; as that is the sound we most easily make when we look up to the heavens.
It also had really cool Ahhhh music in the background. Wish I could find it.</p>

<p>The true history of humanity, the field of electrogravitics, brain-computer interface technology including mind-control, geo-engineering and the extent it&#39;s used, social engineering and the extent it&#39;s used, etc., etc.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t to say that there isn&#39;t information out there about these topics but there&#39;s no denying that they are <em>not</em> discussed in the mainstream and are in general relegated to &quot;conspiracy circles&quot; despite the fact that there are government patents for most of these and plenty of proof that they&#39;ve been researched (and used) extensively.</p>

<p>Why were Nikola Tesla&#39;s works confiscated after his death?  Why were  over six tons of Wilhelm Reich&#39;s works burned?</p>

<p>I actually worked in a university lab on this technology and all of our funding came from DARPA b/c the government doesn&#39;t have the budget for funding their own dedicated departments for this bleeding edge research. There are several major journals dedicated to publishing this material.</p>

<p>As far as mind control, my degree was in biochemistry with a minor in neuroscience, and the portrayal of mind-control is far from the actual realities of implementation. Truth-serums? Barely more effective than alcohol.</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m not saying that secret research facilities don&#39;t exist at all. What I&#39;m saying is that the <em>vast majority</em> of bleeding-edge research is done in academia, where there are <em>lots of specialized academics.</em> So sure, at Fort Detrick they have specialized, biowarfare research that&#39;s off the books.

<p>You should look into some of it.  <em>Fingerprints of the Gods</em> would be a good place to start.</p>

<p>Are you referring to TT Brown?  His is by no means the only work done on this subject.  I&#39;d recommend Paul LaViolette&#39;s book - he&#39;s compiled a ton of good information about it.  Joseph P. Farrell also has a few books that touch on this research.  It&#39;s pretty well documented.</p>

<p>What do you think UFOs are?  And yes, hundreds have been documented by the US government.</p>

<p>What do you think about MK-Ultra and Monarch programming?  How about V2K technology?  Have you ever read the &quot;Mindwar&quot; paper co-written by Michael Aquino?  It&#39;s pretty short.  I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re deliberately downplaying some of the technology that&#39;s been in existence for decades but if not you should try looking into some of it because I believe you&#39;re way off here in saying that alcohol is as effective.</p>

<p>Dude.  Oil is where the big money is.  Have you noticed how many people have been killed to protect the petrodollar over the last century?  Alternate forms of cheaper energy are <em>not</em> the priority for those who own the US government (at least not on a large scale).  Energy is one of the most closely guarded and controlled fields in all of science.</p>

<p>Dr. LaViolette is an interesting and smart man. He&#39;s been quite productive throughout his life, but yet the Biefeld-Brown effect <em>has never been reproduceable.</em> Ever. So while some of his other theories are interesting and worth pursuing, I don&#39;t think one can objectively buy into that particular theory given the history of laboratory failure.</p>

<p>As for Joseph P Farrell, he&#39;s never had any scientific training and does not practice the craft of inquiry with any rigor at all. He&#39;s a snake-oil salesman.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MK-ULTRA</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Was the equivalent of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731">Unit 731</a>, but specifically psychological. They did tons of unethical experimentation to be sure, but &quot;mind control&quot; was never very successful -- unless you count psychological torture (sensory deprivation, etc.) as &quot;mind control.&quot; But insofar as a chemical that controls what you do and forces you tell the truth or take action -- that doesn&#39;t exist. They tried, but it didn&#39;t work. They found that torture works.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Alternative energy <em>is</em> the next big thing. Even the banks realize this. Every university worth it&#39;s name has scientists researching energy. To claim that every lab, at every university, in every country, is being &quot;guarded and controlled&quot; is implausible.</p>

<p>Go inside a Faraday cage -- if the voices consistently stop, then maybe it <em>is</em> the feds in the white van across the street. If the voices don&#39;t go away, schizophrenia.</p>

<p>And actually as I read up on it more, it&#39;s completely out there. From the support group:</p>

<p>Current-day voice to skull cannot be stopped by any known electromagnetic shielding, a fact which demonstrates how advanced classified mind control technology has become.</p>

<p>Such as statement is infuriatingly ignorant and a disservice to people who need help. The amount of energy required, the real-time targeting that would be required to track a single-individual (or other people would be affected), and with no loss of fidelity. I don&#39;t even.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is extremely interesting. It reminds me of some tests done awhile back where they introduced sound waves to a pan of sand at certain frequencies, and the frequencies caused the sand to create patterns. These patterns were very intricate and replicable oer each frequency, and those patterns also tended to fit some ancient megalithic stuctures and stuff.</p>

<p>Maybe there is a connection, here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s exactly what I&quot;m talking about.</p>

<p>I feel like a certain harmony or set of tones will produce the flower of life pattern and that there is something special to that frequency. I wish I had the time and money to make my own setup so I can fool around and see what I can get. I&#39;ve never seen anyone apply 2 tones at once to a cymatic setup, I want to know what shapes it produces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen some of that and find it intruiging. I&#39;ll have to look into the cymatic impliations from it. I assume the 440hz doesn&#39;t produce the symmetrical, beautiful geometric patterns we find in nature?</p>
