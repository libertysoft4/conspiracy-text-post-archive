<p>For the record, I don&#39;t consider the fact that they filmed a documentary about the Ukraine crisis and painted Russia as the aggressor as evidence that VICE is corporate propaganda designed to look like new edgy alternative media. The reporter there might have just been one of the many people who genuinely do believe that Russia was the aggressor. </p>

<p>FYI, I don&#39;t think Russia was the aggressor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good information there. </p>

<p>I do want to say that simply because they have investors does not automatically mean that VICE&#39;s reporting is going to reflect a certain agenda. </p>

<p>In order for that to be true we have to make some pretty bold assumptions that those with editorial authority at VICE, such as the co-founder Shane Smith, are going to be on board with promoting there investors alleged agenda. At the end of the day, VICE has such a large worldwide appeal that they almost don&#39;t need to appease the investors mentioned in the Guardian article, it&#39;s not like they cannot make money on their own, they have a huge audience.</p>

<p>The investors in the above article could just as likely be looking at VICE in purely financial terms, it&#39;s a damn good investment at the end of the day. $70 million is not a lot for Murdoch’s Empire. If that figure was significantly higher I would be more suspicious about what sort of an influence 21st Century Fox wanted to have over VICE. Even the article calls the investments “minority investor deals” citing that VICE will remain independently controlled by its senior management led by Smith.  </p>

<p>Apart from all of that, all I can say is that this really comes down to whether or not you can trust VICE’s senior management and Shane Smith. That is a difficult question to answer without being subjective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well VICE create an awful lot of content, and the MSM in its entirety report on simply overwhelming amounts of stories. </p>

<p>I simply cannot write off the entirety of such a vast industry based on who invests in that industry. </p>

<p>Now, of course that is not always true. There are too many examples of political and corporate corruption within the media. But due to the plethora of information we have from VICE and the MSM, it cannot all be reflecting a corporate political agenda. </p>

<p>The media still exposes wrong doing in the world, even if <strong>parts</strong> of the industry can be <em>gotten to</em>. </p>

<p>Good journalism still exists in the MSM, you just have to approach it with more caution, IMO anyway. </p>

<p>If we know that it is a fact that CNN takes direct payments from governments and governments are willing to pay the media companies directly, then what makes you think this same mechanism is not at play here?</p>

<p>If you are still one of those people who gives the media companies &quot;the benefit of the doubt&quot;, then I&#39;d like to do a real estate deal with you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, well I cannot speak much for CNN. And what you said about them doesn&#39;t surprise me, so if I obtain information from CNN, I&#39;ll approach it with caution and bare what you said in mind. </p>

<p>But I know journalists who have worked at the BBC for example,  I met some when I did a brief period of work experience at my local newspaper and also some of the lectures at the Journalism department at my former university in the UK had worked for the BBC and other British MSM media outlets in the past. </p>

<p>All of them were good honest people who cared about their profession. The MSM is an incredibly fragmented industry. Editorial authority does not just exist with a group of employees at the top who have overall say. Large media organisations have many sub editors who have authority on what will be in tomorrows paper. </p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is not to write off the industry in its <strong>entirety</strong>. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry about the anecdotal story there. But the proof is out there. Quick example would be the MP&#39;s expense scandal in the UK. Virtually every single MSM establishment in the UK extensively reported on that, it was on all of the front pages and high up in the running order within Broadcast news media. Totally against the governments interest. </p>

<p>For the record, you are right, that mechanism is at play. I just don&#39;t think it is always at play and I don&#39;t think it effects a media organisation as a whole. The news media is often a wash with anti-government and anti-corporate stories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically it comes down to this. Alt news channel looking for capital. MSM news empire notices said situation. MSM empire throws alt news a bone on a simple condition. Put x,y or z on board. If the $$$ is enough, x,y,or z gets on the board and a relationship is forged. Alt news is looking to grow, MSM empire licks their chops, says they will give more $$$ for x,y or z conditions. So on and so forth, until alt media wants to IPO. They announce they do, they seek capital, sugar daddy who has been there in the past, now has a rock hard boner. MSM empire says they will help under x,y, or z conditions. Alt media agrees, said company goes public, now MSM empire has huge stake. The rest, as they say is history. MSM over rules alt original founder, because now alt news is public. Responsible to share owners and the board. Founder gets pushed out, alt media is now a subsidiary of MSM empire. Pretty easy to see the chess pieces in this one mate. Just follow the money and learn business savvy. Steve Jobs was kicked out of leadership of the company he founded. Happens all the time in business.</p>

<p>The investors exert influence, but the business model is controlling.</p>

<p>The business model is shoveling in as much corporate cash as possible. To keep that rolling, Vice is very careful to avoid offending brands and exerts editorial control to do precisely that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m interested in hard facts about this too. I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m a fan of VICE simply because I like the fact that they do actually journalism and get boots on the ground and give us footage from the actual thing that&#39;s happening. Like the Ebola stuff. They actually show you a guy going around a bush meat market in Africa talking to people about what they feel about the whole thing.</p>

<p>That being said I definitely get the vibe from them often that they are pushing a narrative. It seems to change from story to story but the more political the issue the more it feels like there is an agenda.</p>

<p>Other segments like Hamilton&#39;s Pharmacopeia seems to be legitimate counter culture media, but the political stuff always feels a little bit skewed.</p>

<p>One good example to me was the one about females in the men&#39;s right movement, and the Chinese donor who was trying to buy homless people food. Both of those stories felt very spin heavy.</p>

BBC did a documentary on ISIS, but they wouldn&#39;t actually film within the Islamic State for fear of kidnapping and imprisonment. VICE went straight in there and managed to get an hour long tour of the IS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of the biggest &quot;assets&quot; of intelligence agencies are reporters and journalists. </p>

<p>I believe they say things that this audience wants to hear, but it is used to sanitize that destructive info, and put it out in a controlled manner as an entertainment product, so that it is not taken seriously. </p>

<p>&quot;A limited hangout, or partial hangout, is a public relations or propaganda technique that involves the release of previously hidden information in order to prevent a greater exposure of more important details.[citation needed]</p>

<p>It takes the form of deception, misdirection, or coverup often associated with intelligence agencies involving a release or &quot;mea culpa&quot; type of confession of only part of a set of previously hidden sensitive information, that establishes credibility for the one releasing the information who by the very act of confession appears to be &quot;coming clean&quot; and acting with integrity; but in actuality, by withholding key facts, is protecting a deeper operation and those who could be exposed if the whole truth came out&quot;</p>

<p>In mid-August 2013, Rupert Murdoch&#39;s corporation 21st Century Fox invested US$70 million in Vice Media, resulting in a 5 percent stake. Following the announcement, Smith explained, &quot;We have set ourselves up to build a global platform but we have maintained control.&quot;[6][7]</p>

<p>In June 2014, it was reported that Time Warner was negotiating to acquire a stake in Vice Media; among the company&#39;s plans were to give Vice control over the programming of HLN—a spin-off network of CNN which had recently struggled in its attempts to re-focus itself as a younger-skewing, social media-oriented news service. However, the deal fell through as the companies were unable to agree on a proper valuation.[8][9] In turn, it was revealed on August 29, 2014 that A&amp;E Networks—a joint venture of Hearst Corporation and The Walt Disney Company, would acquire a 10% minority stake in Vice Media for $250 million.[10]</p>

The way they report gives it away too.  Bottom line, everything published gets approved by a corporate bagmuncher that makes sure the narrative is consistant with the &quot;news&quot;.  It also gives them an outlet to release the &quot;other side of the story&quot; because usually they have boots on the ground.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, basically this is how it was, I read &quot;the vice guide to sex drugs and rock n roll&quot; back in 2005 or so before they blew up. It started as a welfare make work project among heroin addicts in Montreal, Gavin, Shane and Suroosh (iirc).</p>

<p>Gavin was the figurehead and literally invented the term &quot;hipster,&quot; he wrote the majority of the articles and had the most control over the project. Shane was the head of marketing and in 2009 they had a big disagreement over where VICE was heading, Gavin sold his stake and went solo, becoming a fox news pundit (red eye) and writing libertarian/conservative themed articles, doing stand up comedy, making movies, etc. </p>

<p>Shane and Suroosh or whatever were basically overjoyed to get the creativity and &quot;indie&quot; part out and just maximized profits by being derivative and appealing to the demographic (hipsters) that Gavin had helped build. If you watch enough VICE you see they do their best to toe the line and maintain the status quo. Their coverage of the Israel/Palestine genocide ended with video titled &quot;Hamas remains defiant&quot; ending on a reporter literally filming a TV screen with a militant on it, this is after, in the last video, Israel blew up part of the hotel they were staying in for seemingly no reason. </p>

<p>They do all they can to appear &quot;edgy&quot; and &quot;not mainstream&quot; while being actively mainstream the whole time, the only difference is their correspondents have different haircuts than TV news anchors. Sure they&#39;ve got some more interesting &quot;raw footage&quot; than you might see somewhere else but their slant has always been towards demographics. Nothing they do is groundbreaking and never will be. Shane Smith runs it and he&#39;s concerned with the bottom line: money, it&#39;s good they&#39;ve managed to legitimize themselves somewhat with the mainstream news but they really aren&#39;t any different </p>
