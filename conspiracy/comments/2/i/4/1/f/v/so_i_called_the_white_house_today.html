    <div class="md"><p>Same here. I don&#39;t know about you but I want true freedom. Their needs to be people like us because if there wasn&#39;t, we&#39;d be where they want us to be already, as serfs. Honestly in my head I am truly free. Everything I do is my choice. Freedom is a state of mind, in my opinion,  based on your likes and dislikes. </p>

<p>I know it goes deeper then that but I really think about the costumes the cops wear and how they think they are above the law because they have a shiny badge and a gun. I laugh when I see cops because it is just a costume they have on and they don&#39;t even realize they are the politicians will manifested in human for to do their bidding on whatever laws they sign</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True freedom.  That thought has plagued me for years.  I once thought I was free, growing up in a solid middle class family in America.</p>

<p>I once thought I was free, becoming a man and starting a family.</p>

<p>I once thought I was free, when I realized I was being lied to and that I had the power to free myself.</p>

<p>I once thought I was free, only bound by the limits of my (chosen) moral compass.</p>

<p>I have realized, I am only as free as I want to be.</p>

<p>How long did it take again?  Less than a week for the &#39;guard&#39; to resort to brutality?  That&#39;s a disturbing study, and speaks volumes of the threat of authority over others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes sir. I think it was exactly at the 1 week mark. The doctor said he felt like a prison warden. I think the number of the guy they were messing with was 226. Months later 226 and the guard said they still felt weird around each other </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not exactly as you are trying to imply, but you may potentially show signs of what could lead to becoming a terrorist, which may then lead to increased surveillance.</p>

<p>Read the whole of the first document from the link you posted, because the author of the activist post you linked is actually misconstruing what is said in the document.</p>

<p>The activist post says people who may be considered terrorist are &quot;Those that talk about individual liberties&quot;, but that&#39;s not actually true according to the document.</p>

<p>DEOMI EOAC STUDENT GUIDE - 3150 - EXTREMISM - FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY - DO NOT USE ON THE JOB</p>

<p>Introduction Section E. Recruiting moves, Subsection 1. Introduction bullet point 2 states: Nowadays, instead of dressing in sheets or publicly espousing hate messages, many extremists will talk of individual liberties, states’ rights, and how to make the world a better place.</p>

<p>So the document doesn&#39;t actually state &quot;if you talk about personal liberties, you are a terrorist&quot;, it states that this is one of the recruitment efforts that extremist groups engage in.</p>

<p>TL;DR - The activist post is misleading and wrong, and it&#39;s that type of shit that makes people view this sub as not credible, because people post articles that state things that are wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because what you&#39;re saying isn&#39;t actually correct.</p>

<p>Having differing views than the government does not automatically define you as a potential terrorist, and none of the documents within the link you provided support those sentiments.</p>

<p>The author of that activist post is engaging in yellow journalism, allow me to explain it again.</p>

<p>Read the whole of the first document from the link you posted, because the author of the activist post you linked is actually misconstruing what is said in the document.</p>

<p>The activist post says people who may be considered terrorist are &quot;Those that talk about individual liberties&quot;, but that&#39;s not actually true according to the document.</p>

<p>Now do you understand?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not skeptical of what you said in regards to specific individuals being targeted for enhanced surveillance for specific reasons, that is so documented it&#39;s insane, even the IRS is doing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In response to that awful incorrect activist post article you linked:</p>

<p>Read the whole of the first document from the link you posted, because the author of the activist post you linked is actually misconstruing what is said in the document.</p>

<p>The activist post says people who may be considered terrorist are &quot;Those that talk about individual liberties&quot;, but that&#39;s not actually true according to the document.</p>

<p>DEOMI EOAC STUDENT GUIDE - 3150 - EXTREMISM - FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY - DO NOT USE ON THE JOB</p>

<p>Introduction Section E. Recruiting moves, Subsection 1. Introduction bullet point 2 states: Nowadays, instead of dressing in sheets or publicly espousing hate messages, many extremists will talk of individual liberties, states’ rights, and how to make the world a better place.</p>

<p>So the document doesn&#39;t actually state &quot;if you talk about personal liberties, you are a terrorist&quot;, it states that this is one of the recruitment efforts that extremist groups engage in.</p>

<p>TL;DR - The activist post is misleading and wrong, and it&#39;s that type of shit that makes people view this sub as not credible, because people post articles that state things that are wrong.</p>

<p>My God this shit is getting old.</p>

<p>NOW, as to the second article you linked.</p>

<p>The only &quot;privacy-conscious&quot; people being labelled as suspect by the NSA are those who are explicitly looking for software which allows one to avoid direct surveillance online.</p>

<p>It is targeting people who actually do show signs of &quot;potential terrorist activity&quot; only by the fact that terrorist groups are actively trying to avoid surveillance by using tools of the same nature for anonymous communication.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the ultimate goal of the surveillance state is total population control</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Duh? They wouldn&#39;t be spying on you if they weren&#39;t trying to control you in any way, even if the controlling is indirect, such as by posting a whole bunch of shit online to scare you into just staying in your home and going nowhere, not being any form of threat to their system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean if the government routinely spied on our president, what makes you think you&#39;re spared?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>None of us are spared, we are all spied on, all of us are more than likely spied on more just for posting here, so what the fuck does making a call to the white house requesting the president takes actions which will secure our national safety and security matter?</p>

<p>If anything, that should make them view you in a better light as you are showing that you do not want any harm to befall your fellow citizens.</p>

<p>No, but that&#39;s not what&#39;s happening here.</p>

<p>I have a friend that was running a proxy once, and one day an FBI agent came to his house asking about somebody in Germany trying to sell a baby on craigslist. Needless to say, he stopped running the proxy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The analogy is useful (at some levels of analysis) but does break down. The brain does perform <em>computations</em> (at least: some our computational models fit with observations).</p>

<p>Computers&#39; power comes from the capacity to rapidly process information using binary to perform Boolean operations. This is done in serial. Brains are much slower than a computer, and heavily use parallel processing (although both parallel and serial are used such as in the dorsal and ventral visual pathways). Brains have an absurd <em>number</em> of subunits with ridiculous <em>connectivity</em> which allows statistical computation - also the degrees of freedom in the way signals can be modulated is huge. Both feed-back and feed-forward means that signals can be altered at many levels in a pathway, [my textbook claims] in the thalamo-cortical loops to the motor cortex around ~70% of the neurons are from the cortex back to the thalamus feeding back on the signals at an earlier stage which allows fine adjustments (like an optimisation).</p>

<p>One final difference, if we&#39;re looking at temporal processes, brains as we think of them have enormous causal power in the world; our brains control a sophisticated motor system, not to mention many autonomous systems to control our viscera. We live. We change our environment, we disperse force through space over time, we react. Computers are much more inert, relying on user input. The way our brain develops and changes (thus what certain computations, at a macro level, end up producing) is shaped by memory and feedback from exercising that causal power.</p>

<p>So yeah, the analogy is limited.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be too quick to marginalize those ideologies any more than capitalism or &quot;democracy&quot;.  They&#39;re all forms of control that have been put in place by an elite and designed to limit the masses.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not certain that crony capitalism wasn&#39;t always the actual <em>point</em>, and &quot;free market capitalism&quot; was nothing more than a trojan horse TPTB brought in to sell to the masses so that they could then create multinational corporations and take the veneer  of faux &quot;freedom&quot; off &quot;free market capitalism&quot; and reveal what it in reality was all along:  A manipulative corporatocracy.</p>

<p>Privacy has always been a sort of illusion. If you work somewhere, the information of when you leave your house every day, what route you take, where your work place is, when you leave work, and how you get home is all public information, should somebody track said info.</p>

<p>This is easily done with use of no electronic equipment, you could gain it all by following the person around on horseback and writing it all down if you really wanted to use no electricity, I&#39;m not being hyperbolic either I&#39;m being dead serious.</p>

<p>If they were tapping your phone or some stupid shit you&#39;d never know. They would just arrange it with your service provider and you would be &quot;tapped&quot;. It wouldn&#39;t exactly require then to call you and static your phone. </p>

<p>You called a publicly available phone number that allows you to speak with the &quot;President&quot;. Plus you&#39;ll probably never be forwarded to him,  and they probably don&#39;t even tell him what is said. </p>

<p>This is so obscenely wrong I don&#39;t even know where to begin.</p>

<p>Or has DARPA not developed laser systems and drones which can stay airborne for over 3 weeks with a visual radius of coverage of 25 kilometers with the ability to view up to 3 inches from the ground and have over 12 displays pulled up which all track every object in motion on screen?</p>

<p>Right, the government is NOT terrible with technology, you are confusing that for the government being in bed with corrupt businesses, holding back technological progress so as to maximize profits.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If they were tapping your phone or some stupid shit you&#39;d never know.</p>

<p>Sounds like they they aren&#39;t terrible with technology if they are capable of doing that, the average citizen is completely incapable of that, so really the average citizen is more inept with technology than the federal government.</p>

<p>You know, especially considering the government makes Ion thrusters.</p>

<p>No fucking duh, they&#39;re an agency of the government, which is why it&#39;s absurd to make general statements like &quot;the government doesn&#39;t understand technology&quot;.</p>

<p>Senators are not &quot;the government&quot;, they are our elected officials which comprise a certain portion of the government.</p>

<p>Of course there are going to be people we elect which don&#39;t understand certain technologies, hell, nobody actually understand the principals which govern how every piece of technology works.</p>

<p>Not every single human being has full knowledge of electronics, mechanics, plumbing, architecture, etc.</p>

<p>This is why people study specific areas of knowledge.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t I say what the call back was? Because I have no idea, it could be pure coincidence that he received two masked calls in a row, shit, for all we know he could be entirely making that up.</p>

<p>Such as?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve seen it first hand.</p>

<p>From individuals, that doesn&#39;t equate to the whole, thus you can&#39;t use that as basis for claiming that &quot;the government knows nothing of technology&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not too hard to believe someone didn&#39;t setup a callback correctly and that&#39;s why it did what it played static and a click.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, that&#39;s a possibility for sure, though a small possibility as the automated callback system has been in place for years and doesn&#39;t require any human to allow the call to be placed once a person has placed a call themselves, that&#39;s why it&#39;s called automated call back.</p>

<p>It could also possibly be a technical error.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It could also just be from something unrelated.</p>

<p>Also a possibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The answer to your question is simple... because of the GDP (aka the economy).  Let&#39;s skip all the feasibility issues with shutting down every single international airport, closing the borders, and also shutting down the ports of entry (yes, people still come into the country via boats, trains, and other methods of travel).  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say that they actually did close everything.  This would prevent <em>any</em> entry or exit from the country, not just for people, but goods also.  This includes food, clothing, and even the materials to build structures that are harvested from other countries and shipped to the US.  The shelves would be cleared in a matter of days as shoppers purchased every single item that was previously shipped in from China, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and other various cheap-labor countries.  Gas stations would run dry because we can&#39;t import crude oil from other countries anymore to process in our refineries.  Besides the severe lack of food (which would cause a mass panic and hundreds of thousands of deaths), consumption (i.e. buying useless crap from stores) would come to a screeching halt, and, if you knew the first thing about economics, you would realize that the GDP of the US is based on the cash flow from one hand to another.  This includes the cash flow from consumer to business but also includes the cash flow between corporations and foreign countries at the ports of entry when they pay for the goods that come in on huge container ships.  And the GDP is the virtual paycheck of the US which means that the entire system would go belly-up in a matter of days.</p>

<p>You are bullying and it&#39;s not common sense, you can&#39;t even explain yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You think you are any fucking better?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did I express such sentiments? No.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are the bully trying to impose your fucking will upon me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You were fear mongering, I told you to stop, there&#39;s no way I can do that without &quot;imposing my will&quot; upon you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do not have to listen to some sheep telling me what the fuck to do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody  does, why are you saying that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So go get angry and cry</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No thanks it seems you already have that covered.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but I am allowed to tell you to fuck off ass hole. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can spew as much vitriol as you like. </p>
