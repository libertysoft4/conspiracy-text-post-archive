    <div class="md"><p>Damn. I just got out of (public) High School and I&#39;ve joined the US Military. I was always good in history class, but as of recent I&#39;ve tried to look elsewhere for my information other than my &quot;politically correct&quot; textbook. I knew about the old saying that &quot;history is written by the victors&quot; (perhaps we should say that &quot;history is written by the banksters&quot;), but, damn. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve not finished watching this (yet), but the segment about the American Civil War is particularly interesting to me. I knew that France and Britain were helping the Confederacy, but I never really understood why they didn&#39;t put any of their own &quot;boots on the ground&quot;. I thought it was because France and Britain hated one another, but it seemed they didn&#39;t hate one another enough not to both help the Confederacy. Then perhaps it would be because their shallow water frigates would simply get their asses handed to them by the shallow draft Ironclad Monitors (Britain and France had ironclads, but they drew far too much water to be used effectively in rivers). But there must have been something else to it, Monitors could just be avoided encircled, and trapped, what else was there? </p>

<p>According to the video, that something else was Russia. Though not covered in any great detail, I found this astounding. If I listened to my history teachers and textbooks, Russia is the <em>bad guy</em>. Communism! (for the record, I&#39;m not a fan of communism) Red Scare! Soviet Union! Nuclear Stockpiles! Stalin! Genocide! Police State! Secret Police! WW2 aftermath! (nothing gets mentioned about our race to nuke Japan into submission before the USSR could invade them on August 15th)-They are always painted as the bad guys, especially by mainstream media. Of course, this was the old Soviet Union, not necessarily Russia. </p>

<p>Perhaps <em>we&#39;re</em> the bad guys, with our banksters, our Federal Reserve (and perpetual debt), two party duocracy, mass surveillance (there&#39;s literally a camera on every street corner here in NYC), rouge intelligence agencies, false flag scapegoat wars, maybe we just might be the biggest bad guys ever. In other words, we&#39;ve become the very thing we set out to destroy all those years ago, we&#39;ve become the &quot;new&quot; Soviet Union, as I like to call it, the U.S.S.S.A. (United Soviet Socialist States of America), all thanks to banksters&amp;friends. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;m wrong about some things, but I am only 18, my whole life I have been lied to by my history textbooks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ever read Confessions of an Economic Hit Man? This isn&#39;t just about wars of guns and bombs but also about wars of ideas and cultures. Crossposting from above:</p>

<p>The European debt crisis is, in a way, another banker&#39;s war. It is neither European, nor about debt, nor a crisis.
It is not European because it is largely the product of American right-wing neocon think tanks seeking to discredit any alternative to bloodthirsty capitalism. The hack-and-slash austerity that characterizes Europe is unheard of outside of the US in the past 1,000 years. It is not European because Canada, Australia, NZ, and Japan are all facing exogenous pressure to adopt &quot;reforms&quot; similar to those of Europe, including importing immigrants strikebreakers and renegotiating the human rights to health care and housing.
It is not about debt because obedient Wall Street lapdogs have made similar cuts in AAA-rated Sweden, Finland, and Australia as in the heavily downgraded Spain, Portugal, and Greece. It is not about debt because the US, in spite of the S&amp;P downgrade of 2011, is being held up as the model for these AAA countries and vice versa.
It is not a crisis because it is wholly manufactured by the elite in New York, Washington, Dallas, and Houston.</p>

<p>No.  Saw the interview with the dude, however.  Very enlightening definitely.</p>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<p>I certainly am not saying that distraction doesn&#39;t exist.  Heck, it&#39;s a hallmark of elite manipulation.  I&#39;m saying I just make sure and try not to get <em>distracted</em> by the distraction is all.</p>

<p>Interestingly - and I don&#39;t know whether this was purposeful or not - but you didn&#39;t address anything else &quot;no you did not&quot; said.  Is that because he&#39;s more correct than I perhaps thought he was?</p>

<p>I guess I can understand that reaction too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just thought it was odd that someone thought I was a DoD employee/bot</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So did I, initially.  There <em>is</em> a lot of shilldom on this website (and subreddit in particular) though, so I guess one shouldn&#39;t be surprised at too much at this point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Besides, I wouldn&#39;t be a part of the DoD anyways, I&#39;d be a part of the DHS (USCG).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why so?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just posted what I did because I finally realised I&#39;ve been lied to by my history textbooks and that things are not as they seem.</p>

<p>And I still stand by my initial response saying good on you.  Very good on you.  Stay focused and keep learning then.</p>

<p>Oliver Stone also made a decent mainstream series titled &quot;The Untold History of the United States&quot; for Showtime, but goes along with the official version of 9/11 and the anthrax attacks, if I remember correctly, which I was disappointed in, and doesn&#39;t go into the banking or currency stuff that I remember.

    <div class="md"><p>You are wrong about most of these things. If you actually care about understanding history or &quot;reality&quot; you should look into history as a formal academic field. There is little disagreement on many of these subjects and you don&#39;t want to repeat or even worse, actually believe, the misinformation perpetuated by bad sources. You will find time after time from historians and people in the finance sector that the way the world is has nothing to do with how the &quot;conspiracy&quot; community describes it.  </p>

<p>Being able to discern a credible source is the most important thing a person can know how to do because you are essentially formulating a worldview and viewing all other events through a flawed looking glass if you are unable to do it correctly.  Once you have one flawed perspective that you believe concretely and without question you then begin to confirmation bias your way into making it more concrete.  You eventually become delusional and unable to discuss important subject matters with people/adults who are actually involved in such matters.</p>

<p>The most credible people on most subject matters are academics, people who spend their lives studying a specific subject in a field.  The other most credible people on subjects are people who are actually involved in the inner workings of the military(top secret stuff) and people who are actually involved in the finance sector(have information that the public does not but still nothing too far removed from what people generally understand as reality in the finance academic community).   </p>

<p>Most history textbooks do not have blatant falsehoods in them, but many times questionable contexts. History, as a well researched and thought about subject matter, has a rigorous process in which a presumed fact is either supported by conclusive first hand sources and is not disputed or there are not enough first hand sources to make definite conclusion.  Far too often you have people who have not done the rigorous work required to make the claims they are making, and they simply make them because it is edgy or will pander to the biases that already exist in people.  When in reality they are not qualified to discuss a subject matter. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_criticism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_criticism</a></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_method">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_method</a></p>

<p>People will fill the gaps that they don&#39;t know with x.  These gaps are often gaps because they are incredibly complex subject matters that take a lot of effort to understand.  Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if all the worlds problems had one root cause that we can easily demonize.  The subject matters that many unqualified people with no expertise in the field they are discussing often exploit are economic matters and matters dealing with international relations.  They create simple explanations to fill these gaps and people eat it up.</p>

<p>The USA is far from the &quot;biggest bad guys ever&quot; and this thought is a product of naivety and lack of information.  The USA has the best academic institutions that human civilization has ever amassed, is the leader in technological progress(of which the survival and advancement of human civlization is dependent on), provides the backbone for which all western european countries economies and way of lives are made possible(NATO which is the agreement and military force between western countries to come together if just one of them is attacked of which the US makes up half of), the US also gives more in disaster relief than any other country, not to mention providing a stable economic environment for countries to do business with one another, among many other important roles that improve upon what human civilization is capable of. </p>

<p>I suggest you pick up an Intro to International Relations textbook so you can actually understand the importance of what you are doing while in the military and the role America has in shaping the world. This is important because you will feel better about what you are doing and you will understand that there are no cartoon villains of which America is often characterized as.</p>

<p>It is important for you to know what academics think about the subject you are inquiring into before you take a position on it yourself. Be highly critical of everyone and every source. You will often find that when you do your research that most &quot;conspiratorial thinking&quot; does not hold up to critical analysis. Like I said earlier, conspiratorial thought is always the substitution of a simplified concept in a gap where there is no knowledge of a subject that is complex to understand.  There is always a will to understand a subject without knowing where to begin or where to get the information to be properly informed on the subject.  Many of these sources where conspiracies are propagated they are from people and sources that profit and have a lot to gain by the acceptance of their thoughts.  Actual understanding and propagating new true information is a difficult and rigorous process that often requires the resources of massive media outlets to properly do.</p>

<p>Real journalists and real analysis on what happens in the world actually take place among highly educated and well read people all over the place constantly.  In places where conspiracies are propagated it is often the blind leading the blind with the common trait of people wanting to understand complex matters by reading a paragraph or by watching a 2 hour documentary on the subject. Shit is complex and you will not raise your understanding of things by consuming misinformation from shitty sources.  Ask <a href="/r/askhisory">/r/askhisory</a>, r/economics, <a href="/r/philosophy">/r/philosophy</a>, e-mail professors at a local university, read textbooks(you can buy old editions on amazon for like 5 dollars). </p>

<p>Do not consult the guy who created a blog out of his mother&#39;s basement. I suppose you can but do not have that be the first source you read about a subject, you are just begging to be misinformed by doing this.  From there it is a slippery slope to delusion and detachment from reality.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen and read so many things about &quot;highly educated people&quot; giving their two cents on history, or sound logical thinking when in the end, those highly educated folk were paid off by big business or big banks to disperse the &quot;highly educated&quot; drivel. Alan Greenspan, Frederic Mishkin to name a few were paid to give their two cents, which in the end they were wrong and bad things happened as a result. These people have been groomed by the education system created by high society and big banks to ultimately get these people to think and act a certain way that will benefit the elite. It&#39;s &quot;mother&#39;s basement&quot; thinkers who actually take the time to see the actual truth, as they have nothing to benefit from perpetuating this lie and facade that has been pulled over the masses eyes. &quot;Money rules the universe. It IS the root of all evil. Follow the money. Golden rule, those who have the gold, rule.&quot; These quotes have meaning, and most people dismiss them as silly. But they are all in fact true. Money runs this world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have no idea how academia works or how they come to their conclusions, this is almost universal in all people who espouse conspiracy theories. It is not the &quot;mother&#39;s basement&quot; thinkers who actually take the time to see the &quot;actual truth&quot; because they are not aware of how the truth is derived or concluded in an accurate way.  Their method is often sloppy and with often little to no intellectual integrity or academic merit.  This is often indicated by poor sources, no sources at all, or the presupposition of other unsubstantiated facts.</p>

<p>The utility of formal academic training is that you are exposed to information and processes that you otherwise would not have had exposure to, that in the end provide new insight and a new way of thinking about a subject that you would otherwise not have.  This then allows you to think accurately for yourself and allows you to provide new insight into a subject. </p>

<p>Mind you that anyone can pull up the syllabus for a class at oxford, yale, and harvard, do the readings yourself, which then give you the ability to think objectively about a subject.  Most &quot;mother&#39;s basement&quot; thinkers have not done any reading and the reading that they have done comes from garbage sources who have not done the work(research and the heavy reading required to gather the necessary sources to cite) themselves. The blind leading the blind as I call it.  </p>

<p>If the conclusions that academics arrive at are incorrect or the method in which they conclude what they do is incorrect, they lose credibility, risk losing their place in the school&#39;s faculty, and are essentially useless in general.  Mind you in all academic writing the author states why he thinks x and goes into great detail how he concluded this. &quot;Mother&#39;s basement&quot; thinkers rarely if ever go into great detail on how they concluded what they did because their conclusion is often based on no evidence and poor logic.  This is why their perspective is not mainstream, it has nothing to do with a conspiracy of elites. In credible academic writing you can trace every claim to a well researched and sourced place. You can fact check the academic yourself where as the &quot;mother&#39;s basement thinker&quot; does not leave you any credible sources to fact check his/her conclusion yourself. Mind you that the &quot;mother&#39;s basement thinker&quot; often uses foundational premises that go against established reality time after time. &quot;Established reality&quot; the way that I mean it as, is a conclusion in which there is no debate whatsoever in that the all the sources point to that conclusion being true. </p>

<p>The biggest argument against your incorrect perspective is that if an academic advances the academic perspective on a subject and it is that ground breaking, he/she will be set for life.  They will win a nobel prize, give conferences all around the world on the subject, and sell a lot of books.  The way academics succeed is if they make a ground breaking discovery that is true and supported by evidence and logic.  What makes more sense, an academic who would make an unsubstantiated claim, of which anyone who is curious enough can fact check themselves(this is essential in your misunderstanding of what makes academic work more reliable) or that an academic will risk losing his job for saying saying something that is not properly supported by any facts.  You would be hard pressed to find the private sector funding research in the areas of  political science, philosophy, economics and international relations especially at leading academic institutions so your perspective is incorrect from that perspective as well.  You also have to keep in mind that research is funded in different ways all across the world, and they are all working on the same problems in their respective fields. </p>

<p>Again, all academic arguments are made in a way that anyone who wants more certainty can fact check and criticize the sources that the academic used to come to their conclusion.  Only when it comes under this scrutiny can one then operate as if it were true. It is this academic rigor that lacks in almost every &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; perpetuated.  This is why established academic understanding never supports the conclusions  conspiracy theorists arrive at, not because of your idea that the education system serves &quot;high society&quot; and &quot;big banks&quot; which is absurd and demonstrates your complete ignorance with everything dealing with academia and human civilization&#39;s pursuit for knowledge.  </p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t even know what academia&#39;s perspective is on the subject matter being discussed 99% percent of the time.  This is tragic and there is no reason to be ignorant of what the most educated people in the world on a subject think about their subject of expertise given the access to information and the connectivity the internet provides.  We can literally read what the most educated people on a subject are teaching their students, again, there is no reason to be ignorant of these things unless you are willfully ignorant.  Even if you think academics represent the banks, which is silly, you owe it yourself to be aware of what their positions are on the matters you are thinking about, especially since their perspectives are the ones that are actually consulted when policies are being made most of the time.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>anacardo01, we can break free from the current money enslavement my friend. Remember a few years back when lots of folks closed their bank accounts and opened credit union accounts? </p>

<p>We can create a savings and loan operation related to trades.
Say, for example, one institution is for farmers. All the farmers invest their money there, and the profits are given back to the farming community. Also, affordable loans (that you don&#39;t have to promise your left nut for) are available to farmers as well. It ethically gives back to the farming community.</p>

<p>We can do this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world - no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.”
— U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, a few years after authorizing the creation of the “Federal” Reserve</p>

<p>&quot;Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men&#39;s views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the U.S., in the field of commerce and manufacturing, are afraid of somebody, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.&quot; ~ President Woodrow Wilson 1913</p>

<p>“The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government of the U.S. since the days of Andrew Jackson.” – U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a letter written Nov. 21, 1933 to Colonel E. Mandell House. </p>

<p>“If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their money, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them, will deprive the people of their property until their children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.”

<p>This is fake. It wasn&#39;t attributed to Woodrow Wilson until the 1950s, 30 years after Wilson died. <a href="http://www.salon.com/2007/12/21/woodrow_wilson_federal_reserve/">Wilson was always proud of creating the Federal Reserve.</a></p>

<p>The rest of that quote is from his 1912 campaign speeches.</p>

<p>This is a fake. The words inflation and deflation were not even used in that way during Jefferson&#39;s lifetime. It&#39;s from the 1930s.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.salon.com/2007/12/21/woodrow_wilson_federal_reserve/">the Salon article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>John M. Cooper, a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin, and the author of several books on Woodrow Wilson, writes:</p>

<p>“I can tell you categorically that this is not a statement of regret for having created the Federal Reserve. Wilson never had any regrets for having done that. It was an accomplishment in which he took great pride.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The earliest citation that OED has for deflation of currency is 1920.</p>

The narrator&#39;s diction and manner of communicating strikes me as being very effective in getting through to the more closed-minded and trusting people out there (you know, the ones who call people &quot;tards&quot; for being distrustful of the Federal Reserve Bank).

<p><em>&quot;All of the perplexities, confusion, and distress in America arises, not from the defects of the Constitution or Confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.&quot;</em>  -- John Adams</p>

<p><em>&quot;The government should create, issue, and circulate all the currency and credit needed to satisfy the spending power of the government and the buying power of consumers. The privilege of creating and issuing money is not only the supreme prerogative of government, but it is the government’s greatest creative opportunity. The financing of all public enterprise, and the conduct of the treasury will become matters of practical administration. Money will cease to be master and will then become servant of humanity.&quot;</em> ~ Abraham Lincoln</p>

<p><em>&quot;It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.&quot;</em> -- Henry Ford</p>

<p><em>&quot;It is absurd to say our country can issue bonds and cannot issue currency. Both are promises to pay, but one fattens the usurer and the other helps the people.&quot;</em> -- Thomas Edison</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The European debt crisis is, in a way, another banker&#39;s war. It is neither European, nor about debt, nor a crisis.</p>

<p>It is not European because it is largely the product of American right-wing neocon think tanks seeking to discredit any alternative to bloodthirsty capitalism. The hack-and-slash austerity that characterizes Europe is unheard of outside of the US in the past 1,000 years. It is not European because Canada, Australia, NZ, and Japan are all facing exogenous pressure to adopt &quot;reforms&quot; similar to those of Europe, including importing <del>immigrants</del> strikebreakers and renegotiating the human rights to health care and housing.</p>

<p>It is not about debt because obedient Wall Street lapdogs have made similar cuts in AAA-rated Sweden, Finland, and Australia as in the heavily downgraded Spain, Portugal, and Greece. It is not about debt because the US, in spite of the S&amp;P downgrade of 2011, is being held up as the model for these AAA countries and vice versa.</p>

<p>It is not a crisis because it is wholly manufactured by the elite in New York, Washington, Dallas, and Houston.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The opening of this documentary begins with two quotes, one from Benjamin Franklin, the other from Mayer Amschel Rothschild. </p>

<p>Both of those quotes are completely unverifiable. Seriously, what a way to start an important documentary.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with using those quotes to support ones argument. However, there is something wrong with not letting the viewer know that those quotes are unverifiable. That to me is a manipulation right from the get go, either intentionally or unintentionally.  </p>

<p>This is basic research 101. Check your sources. If a quote cannot be verified, then be honest and admit that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trying to detract from the message that the filmmakers want to get out there.</p>

<p>But if you are going to use quotes to strengthen your argument, you had better make sure that those quotes are verifiable. And if they&#39;re not, then admit that so as to not mislead the viewer. </p>

<p>That Rothschild quote plagues so many documentaries and articles that have a conspiratorial undertone. Not once have I heard a narrator of one of these films, or an author of one of the many articles you can find online that follows the Rothschild quote with the words, &quot;however, this quote is not verifiable&quot;, so take it with a pinch of salt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And what is your approach to determining whether a quote is real or not? It&#39;s extremely easy to make up words and attach some famous person&#39;s name to them.</p>

<p>Real quotes can be traced back to a specific time and place, to a letter or book or speech or interview. If you can&#39;t do that, then there&#39;s a very high likelihood that the quote was fabricated, like these two were.</p>

<p>Russia is part of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa + &gt;100 other nations) bank, setup to be an eastern alternative to Rothschild banks so they can abandon the USD as a reserve currency entirely. They have their own alternative to SWIFT too.</p>

<p>The dollar&#39;s days are numbered. Buy physical gold, if you still can. China is about to double the price of gold, which will expose the fact that COMEX is a fraud and has no gold. That may well initiate the USD crash.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, two thumbs up.  Thank you r/conspiracy.  I like the featured documentary addition, and this is definitely the best one I have seen yet. </p>

<p>I agree sources would be nice though and would make for a more compelling argument when sharing with others.  Especially for most who are not even aware or do not care about the problems which surround us.  Nevertheless, great film.  </p>

<p>For those interested in more history and background, I found the following books very informative.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to learn more on why World War I started, “The Guns Of August,” by Barbara Tuchman is great, while “Liberty &amp; Power,” by Harry Watson is great for learning more about Andrew Jackson and the first American National Banks.  If you’re interested in more of a focused Federal Reserve piece, “The Creature from Jekyll Island” by Edward Griffin is decent.  “The Case for Gold,” by Ron Paul also provides an insightful look at the formations of banking institutions in the US and the pyramid of credit.   </p>

<p>Finally, for those interested in money and the introduction to a possible new economic system, check out “Freegold” by Blondie.  It’s a short essay.</p>

<p><a href="http://matrixsentry.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/blondies-freegold-summary.pdf">http://matrixsentry.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/blondies-freegold-summary.pdf</a></p>

<p>I’m always open to suggestions on other great writings as well.  Thanks again r/conspiracy.  :D</p>

<p>&quot;No, it hasn&#39;t been cooling since 1998. Even if we ignore long term trends and just look at the record-breakers, that wasn&#39;t the hottest year ever. Different reports show that, overall, 2005 was hotter than 1998. What&#39;s more, globally, the hottest 12-month period ever recorded was from June 2009 to May 2010.</p>

<p>Though humans love record-breakers, they don&#39;t, on their own, tell us a much about trends -- and it&#39;s trends that matter when monitoring Climate Change. Trends only appear by looking at all the data, globally, and taking into account other variables -- like the effects of the El Nino ocean current or sunspot activity -- not by cherry-picking single points.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a tendency for some people just to concentrate on surface air temperatures when there are other, more useful, indicators that can give us a better idea how rapidly the world is warming. Oceans for instance -- due to their immense size and heat storing capability (called &#39;thermal mass&#39;) -- tend to give a much more &#39;steady&#39; indication of the warming that is happening.  Records show that the Earth has been warming at a steady rate before and since 1998 and there is no sign of it slowing any time soon (Figure 1).  More than 90% of global warming heat goes into warming the oceans, while less than 3% goes into increasing the surface air temperature.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking of long term trends being ignored.</p>

<p>I&#39;m always amused when people who support the AGW/ACC theories talk about the shills and crazies ignoring long term trends while they gloss over the fact that we&#39;ve been in an interglacial period for 15,000-20,000 years.  That&#39;s a long term trend that means the earth is heating up from well before mankind had the ability to significantly alter the atmospheric composition.</p>

<p>But I agree, long term trends are important when analysing data.  We just have to be careful not to support the trends that support our position while we ignore the trends that fail to support our position.</p>

<p>For example the Vostok ice core data shows periods of sudden temperature drops and rises that lead the changes in Co2. This would suggest that there are forces at work more powerful than atmospheric Co2 levels.  Which kind of makes our climate change models look stupid. Which of course is the reality, our models have failed to predict anything significant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does anyone here know how citing references works? You should skip the documentary and go straight to the author&#39;s &quot;well researched&quot; essay, which is the outline for the documentary, the bullshit is more obvious.</p>

<p>Just because a narrator is speaking with conviction and saying things you agree with does not mean his thoughts have any connection to reality.  When you read his essay you can see how it has no sources and the ones that he does have are laughable.  He actually quotes a person in a forum quoting a person. Not only is that moronic in and of itself, but it is probably a link to something he, himself, wrote in a forum and he is being told he is incorrect by EVERYONE.  </p>

<p>If this were a graded research paper he would have gotten an F because there are no citations for the most important and outrageous claims he is making.  That is not how you write about history in an accurate reliable way.  </p>

<p>I wish every documentary came with an outline/essay to support it, so you can see how much of what is being said is properly sourced.  For those who don&#39;t know what a source is, it is the place that would lead you to hold position x, which is required for every factual statement you are claiming. You can&#39;t just say something  as a matter of fact, without showing why you think it is a matter of fact .  None of the context or implications this guy is making is supported by any reliable source. He does have a lot of pictures though.  Read his research paper.  </p>

<p>This just shows how much these documentaries rely on non substantive things to produce trust and belief in the narrator and the information he is communicating. Notice the music, tone of voice, and accent leading you to believe that the person speaking has credible sources. This guy has no credible sources...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the Confederacy seceded from the United States, the bankers once again saw the opportunity for a rich harvest of debt, and offered to fund Lincoln&#39;s efforts to bring the south back into the union, but at 30% interest. Lincoln remarked that he would not free the black man by enslaving the white man to the bankers and using his authority as President, issued a new government currency, the greenback.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, this is not a real quote. Also, the greenback was issued on congressional authority, not presidential authority.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a direct threat to the wealth and power of the central bankers, who quickly responded.</p>

<p>This is a quote from the London Times</p>

<p>&quot;If this mischievous financial policy, which has its origin in North America, shall become endurated down to a fixture, then that Government will furnish its own money without cost. It will pay off debts and be without debt. It will have all the money necessary to carry on its commerce. It will become prosperous without precedent in the history of the world. The brains, and wealth of all countries will go to North America. That country must be destroyed or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How could anyone possibly believe that this is real? Why would anyone publish something that says, in effect, <em>the Americans have found the secret to wealth but we must stop them because we&#39;re greedy monarchists</em>?</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually a hoax from the 1890s.</p>

<p>The <em>Seattle Post</em> said (as reprinted in <em>Grand Junction News</em>, <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ilFfAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;sjid=N1YNAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;pg=731,2178763">&quot;Forged Documents&quot;,Oct. 10, 1896, p. 3</a>), &quot;Another article going the rounds of the Populist press is an alleged extract from an editorial by the London Times. One of our local contemporaries reproduced it. This was one of the most glaringly absurd forgeries which has yet appeared in print, for it represents the Thunderer using the language of the most rabid type of wild-eyed Populists.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Goaded by the private bankers, much of Europe supported the Confederacy against the Union, with the expectation that victory over Lincoln would mean the end of the Greenback.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The actual issue was the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=RiD8c21B-7MC&amp;amp;pg=PA12">blockade of the cotton supply</a> from the South. The manufacture of textiles and clothing was a <em>huge</em> part of the world economy in the 1860s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>France and Britain considered an outright invasion of the United States to aid the confederacy, but were held at bay by Russia, which had just ended the serfdom system and had a state central bank similar to the system the United States had been founded on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no information on Russia&#39;s banking system, but the U.S. was not founded on a &quot;state central bank&quot; system.</p>

<p>Many people think that Russia sent their fleet to the U.S. to help us, but <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1835544">that&#39;s not accurate.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Left free of European intervention, the Union won the war, and Lincoln announced his intention to go on issuing greenbacks. Following Lincoln&#39;s assassination, the Greenbacks were pulled from circulation and the American people forced to go back to an economy based on bank notes borrowed at interest from the private bankers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lincoln never said that he would go on issuing greenbacks. During the war he was apologetic about United States notes (greenbacks). He said that large issues of notes were <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln5/1:1126?rgn=div1;view=fulltext">&quot;unavoidable&quot;</a> and he expressed his<a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6/1:112?rgn=div1;view=fulltext"> &quot;sincere regret that it has been found necessary to authorize so large an additional issue of United States notes&quot;</a>. He said that &quot;continued issues of United States notes , without any check to the issues of suspended banks, and without adequate provision for the raising of money by loans, and for founding the issues so as to keep them within due limits, must soon produce disastrous consequences.&quot; So he recommended the creation of the national banking system to produce national bank notes.</p>

<p>He continued to support the national bank system in his later messages to Congress: <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7/1:77?rgn=div1;view=fulltext">[1]</a> <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8/1:298?rgn=div1;view=fulltext">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>The volume of greenbacks was reduced slightly after the war, but they continued in circulation until 1971.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>PART 1</p>

<p>It starts with putting these words into Benjamin Franklin&#39;s mouth: &quot;The refusal of King George 3rd to allow the colonies to operate an honest money system, which freed the ordinary man from the clutches of the money manipulators, was probably the prime cause of the revolution.&quot;</p>

<p>You might wonder to yourself, if that was the prime cause, why is it <em>not even mentioned</em> in the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html">Declaration of Independence</a>?</p>

<p>Of course, Benjamin Franklin never said or wrote anything of the kind. You can search everything he wrote <a href="http://franklinpapers.org/franklin/">at this web site</a>.</p>

<p>This comes from a <a href="http://21stcenturycicero.wordpress.com/fraud/how-benjamin-franklin-made-new-england-prosperous/">hoax circulated by Congressman Binderup in the 1930s.</a></p>

<p>The Currency Act of 1764 was very unpopular in the colonies, but the
furor had almost entirely died down by 1775. Besides the Declaration of
Independence, there were also proclamations from individual colonies and
cities. I searched those for any mentioned of this issue in those
documents, and found it mentioned only by New York, in <a href="http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.1661:1.amarch"><em>The humble
Petition of the General Assembly of the Colony of New-York, to the
King</em></a>. Even there, it&#39;s item 13, not the number one issue:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>13. We likewise think the Act prohibiting the Legislature of this Colony from passing any law for the emission of Paper Currency, to be a legal tender therein, is disadvantageous to the growth and commerce thereof; an abridgment of your Majesty&#39; s prerogative, (in the preservation of which we are deeply interested,) and a violation of our legislative rights; and may hereafter disable your Majesty&#39; s subjects, upon proper requisition, and upon certain emergencies, from granting such aids as may be necessary for the general safety of the Empire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rivero says in the video that the Currect Act &quot;forced the colonists to
conduct their business only using printed bank notes borrowed from the
Bank of England at interest.&quot;</p>

<p>This is wrong in several ways.</p>

<p>First, the Currency Act prevented the colonies from printing <em>legal
tender</em> paper money, not all paper money. Legal tender means that
everyone is forced to accept it as payment.</p>

<p>Second, the main alternative to paper money printed in the colonies was not 
Bank of England notes, it was gold and silver coins, which were scarce
in the colonies.</p>

<p>Third, bank notes are not borrowed at interest. Bank notes are evidence
that the bank owes money to the holder of the note. Rivero shows this
confusion over bank notes several times in this video.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am fascinated lately by the frame of thinking of &quot;de-bunkers&quot;.  It is the same mindframe of a creationist trying to prove their theory against evolution, as soon as one tiny thing does not match up the entire theory is thrown out the window.  I do not ascribe to it, but for the sake of this post I will apply it.</p>

<p>On to the rebuttal. I will start where you did. </p>

<p>Yes it cannot be proven that Benjamin Franklin wrote exactly those words portrayed in the documentary.  But to say that . &quot;Of course, Benjamin Franklin never said or wrote anything of the kind.&quot; is 100% inaccurate.</p>

<p>&#39;Some of the statement might be derived from those made during his examination by the British Parliament in February 1766, published in &quot;The Examination of Benjamin Franklin&quot; in The Parliamentary History of England from the Earliest Period to the Year 1803‎ (1813); when questioned why Parliament had lost respect among the people of the Colonies, he answered: &quot;To a concurrence of causes: the restraints lately laid on their trade, by which the bringing of foreign gold and silver into the Colonies was prevented; the prohibition of making paper money among themselves, and then demanding a new and heavy tax by stamps; taking away, at the same time, trials by juries, and refusing to receive and hear their humble petitions&quot;.&#39;</p>

<p>Examination before the Committee of the Whole of the House of Commons  Thu, Feb 13, 1766</p>

<p>So to summarize Franklin did outline his reasons for the Revolution here:</p>

<ol>
<li> Limits on trade by England (Listed in the Declaration)</li>
<li> The restriction of bringing hard currency into the colonies (gold &amp; silver, not listed in the Declaration)</li>
<li> The prohibition of printing their own money by the colonies</li>
<li> The Stamp Tax (Listed in the Declaration) </li>
<li> The refusal of trial by jury (Listed in the Declaration)</li>
<li> The refusal of other petitions (Listed in the Declaration)</li>
</ol>

<p>To say that Benjamin Franklin &quot;Never said anything of the sort&quot; is intellectually dishonest.  You are exaggerating the facts to meet your agenda, which you seem to be adept of accusing others frequently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>PART 2</p>

<p>Besides all the historical errors in this video, Rivero repeats several
times a misconception that central banks charge interest on currency</p>

<p>This is really important. I read this idea often on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. It
shows that there is tremendous confusion about how central banks work
and what the problems with them are. The main danger of central banks is
not more interest or more taxes, it is more <em>inflation.</em></p>

<p>There is confusion about 3 inter-related ideas:</p>

<p>1. The myth that central banks charge interest on currency.<br/>
2. The relation of central banks to government debt.<br/>
3. The difference between <em>currency</em> and <em>money</em>.</p>

<h1>Central banks do not charge interest on currency</h1>

<p>There is no interest charged on paper currency. At times, banks have <em>paid</em> interest on their banknotes, but no bank of any type, anywhere, at any point in time in the history of the world has <em>charged</em> interest on their banknotes.</p>

<p>The misconception that central banks charge interest on money probably comes from a related true fact. The main way that the Federal Reserve creates new money is by buying U.S. government securities (Treasury bonds). The bonds do pay interest and some of it goes to the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>But,</p>

<p>1. The Federal Reserve only buys a portion of the national debt; traditionally about 10 to 15 percent. Most of the interest goes to the other holders of Treasury bonds.<br/>
2. When the Federal Reserve buys Treasury securities, it does not increase the amount of the national debt or the amount of interest.<br/>
3. It benefits the government two ways when the Fed buys Treasury bonds. First, the anticipation of the Fed&#39;s purchases drives up the price of the bonds at auction, so the government gets more money and thus pays a lowere interest rate. Second, the Fed gives almost all of its profits to the government!</p>

<p>Because the Federal Reserve gives back most of the interest it receives, it only gets about 2% of the <em>net</em> interest on the national debt. The other 98% of the interest goes to other institutions and people.</p>

<p>Historically, there have been people who wanted the government to bypass borrowing entirely and have the government just spend money into existence—for example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenback_Party">Greenback party in the U.S.</a> in the 19th century.</p>

<p>This is usually only done during wartime or other emergency, as it causes inflation, sometimes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation">disastrous inflation</a>. The experience of America during the Revolutionary War of having paper money become worthless (i.e. &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_American_currency#Continental_currency">not worth a continental</a>&quot;) led to a longtime suspicion of government-issued paper money. This has become the general opinion of most major economic powers around the world. This is the main reason that money, in those countries, is only created by central banks that are somewhat independent of the national government.</p>

<h1>How government debt works</h1>

<p>Another myth is that the government must borrow from the Federal
Reserve. In fact, the government never borrows directly from the Federal
Reserve, and even indirectly, only a fraction of the money comes from
the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>Congress decides how money is allocated for spending. It also sets tax
rates which determine how much revenue the government receives. Congress
authorizes the Treasury department to borrow the difference between
spending and revenue, up to a limit that is increased over time.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve has no control over any of this. It does not
determine how much money the government borrows!</p>

<p>The Treasury department borrows money by issuing Treasury bonds, which
it sells at auction, usually several auctions a week. The Federal
Reserve does not participate in these auctions, but <a href="https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_auctions_glance.htm">you
can.</a></p>

<p>People buy and sell Treasury bonds all the time on a secondary market.
This is where the Federal Reserve comes in. If you sell a Treasury bond,
and a regular person or institution buys it, you get money in your bank
account that is subtracted from their bank account. But if the buyer is
the Federal Reserve, the money is new money that was just created. You
won&#39;t be able to tell who bought the bond and the money is just like all
other money once it is in your account. You can spend it as you please.</p>

<p>As I said above, this purchase does not increase the amount of debt.
Those Treasury bonds were already issued by the Treasury department.</p>

<h1>The difference between currency and money</h1>

<p>Notice that when the Federal Reserve purchases Treasury bonds, it
increases the money supply by just changing numbers in bank books. It
doesn&#39;t have to issue <em>currency</em> to do this. The Federal Reserve is also
responsible for distributing paper money —<em>currency</em>— the actual bills
that come in several denominations: $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100.</p>

<p>This is done in a way that doesn&#39;t change the money supply. A member
bank will call up their regional Federal Reserve bank and order paper
money and the bank&#39;s reserve account at the Federal Reserve is debited
by the same amount.</p>

<h1>Payments from the Federal Reserve to the U.S. government</h1>

<p>There are three eras in the Federal Reserve regarding how it gives money
to the federal government.</p>

<p>From 1914 to 1932, the Federal Reserve Banks paid a franchise tax.
During this period, the Federal Reserve mostly bought <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_paper">commercial
paper</a>, except during
1917-1918, so it did not get receive much interest income from the
federal government.</p>

<p>In 1933, the Federal Reserve started buying Treasury securities. Most of its profits were distributed as dividends to the member banks, and the remainder mostly went to building up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)</a>.
This continued up until 1947, when it was decided that the federal government would get <em>all</em> of the Fed&#39;s profits after it paid a 6% dividend to the member banks. This was done under the statute <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2013-title12/html/USCODE-2013-title12-chap3-subchapXII-sec414.htm">(12 USC 414)</a> that allows the Board of Governors to charge the Federal Reserve Banks interest on the amount of their outstanding notes. So, technically, the Federal Reserve Banks <em>pay interest</em> to the government on currency rather than <em>charge interest</em> as Rivero claims. Since it&#39;s not calculated as a percentage, though, it&#39;s just a technicality. The government gets <em>all</em> profits after the dividend.</p>

<p>The amount that the government has received from the Federal Reserve is in <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/annual-report/statistical-tables/2013-statistical-table-11.htm">this table</a> in the two columns under &quot;Distributions to the U.S. Treasury&quot;. The Federal Reserve has paid the government more than one trillion dollars over the decades.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once again the nation was plunged into debt, unemployment, and poverty by the predations of the private central bank, and in 1832 Andrew Jackson successfully campaigned for his second term as President under the slogan, &quot;Jackson And No Bank!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The economy was doing well until Jackson withdrew the government&#39;s money from the Bank of the United States. This causes financial disruption and an economic downturn. There is evidence that Nicholas Biddle, of the Bank of the United States, tried to make the financial hardship in the country worse at this time, or,  at least, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5XSAAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA219&amp;amp;dq=%22evidence+of+suffering+abroad%22">not try to help improve it</a>.</p>

<p>However, that downturn was brief. The economy rebounded when the state banks that received the federal money started lending it out. The real hardship came after the Bank&#39;s charter expired, when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1837">Panic of 1837</a> led to a real economic depression.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Long but real quote from Jackson omitted.]</p>

<p>Shortly after the charter for the second Bank of the United States expired, there was an assassination attempt on Andrew Jackson which failed when both pistols used by the assassin, Richard Lawrence, failed to fire. Later on, Lawrence explained the motive behind the assassination by saying that with President Jackson dead, &quot;Money would be more plenty.&quot; So it was an assassination motivated by the interest of the bankers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Richard Lawrence said a lot of things. He was impressively crazy, even for a presidential (attempted) assassin. Lawrence rambled on about the bank, among many other things. We learned <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=KhsTv6fUnQoC&amp;amp;pg=PA524">at his trial</a> that he had been acting crazy for two years, that he was kicked out of the houses of both of his sisters because he had grown violent and that
he thought:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the President had killed his father, that his influence was so great that he had got every one to persecute his father, so that he died poor.  ...  his father put him with a painter, which he thought very strange, because as he was heir to the Crown, he thought he ought to have been sent to school to fit him for his station. He said the the Government of Rome and Holland, and this country, properly belonged to him; ...  that Jackson had been an enemy of his family ever since he was a boy; he complained that Jackson withheld from him the funds of the bank of which he was the rightful owner; if an attempt should be made to punish him, all the Powers of Europe would rally to his aid; his object in calling on the President was to get money to assist him to go to Europe, where he had now a correspondence; he considered Jackson as nothing more than his clerk, and the cause of all his troubles, his loss of business, etc., and believed he was leagued with his brother, S.  Redfern, to injure him...</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>It took the jury about five minutes to find him not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, finally, in 1913, the Private Central Bankers of Europe, in particular the Rothschilds of Great Britain and the Warburgs of Germany, met with their American financial collaborators on Jekyll Island, Georgia to form a new banking cartel with the express purpose of forming the Third Bank of the United States, with the aim of placing complete control of the United States money supply once again under the control of private bankers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The meeting was actually in 1910. There were no Rothschilds or representatives of the Rothschilds there. Paul Warburg was invited because he was an expert on central banking, one of the most prominent advocates of central banking in America, and had presented his own plan for a central bank.<a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9502E4DA153EE033A25755C0A9679C946697D6CF">[1]</a><a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C04E1DA1F3EE233A25752C0A9649C946997D6CF">[2]</a><a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9500E1DC1631E233A25752C1A9639C946997D6CF">[3]</a><a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9903E4D91430E233A25757C2A9659C946196D6CF">[4]</a><a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E03E2D8173BE430A75750C1A9679D946196D6CF">[5]</a></p>

<p>The meeting on Jekyll Island was called by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_W._Aldrich">Senator Nelson Aldrich</a>, who was chairman of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Monetary_Commission">National Monetary Commission</a>. After two years of study —which produced <a href="http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/topics/?tid=13">numerous volumes of research</a>— he asked for several bankers to assist him in drafting legislation to create a central banking system.</p>

<p>Aldrich was close to the Rockefellers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abby_Aldrich_Rockefeller">His daughter</a> was married to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Rockefeller,_Jr.">John D. Rockefeller, Jr.</a></p>

<p>Besides Aldrich, the others at the meeting were:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._Piatt_Andrew">A. Piatt Andrew</a>, <em>Assistant Secretary of the Treasury</em></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_A._Vanderlip">Frank Vanderlip</a>, <em>National City Bank</em></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Pomeroy_Davison">Henry P. Davison</a>, <em>J P Morgan &amp; Co.</em></li>
<li>Charles D. Norton, <em>First National Bank of New York</em></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Strong,_Jr.">Benjamin Strong</a>, <em>Banker’s Trust of New York</em></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Warburg">Paul Warburg</a>, <em>Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>There are descriptions of the meeting in these two works:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=vq8-AAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA398">Profile of Paul Warburg from <em>Men who are Making America</em> (1916)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.marketskeptics.com/2009/06/frank-vanderlip-and-creation-of-federal.html">Chapter XXI in Frank Vanderlip&#39;s autobiography <em>From Farm Boy to Financier</em> (1935)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The plan produced at the meeting called for the creation of a National Reserve Association. Aldrich&#39;s bill never came up for a vote, but many elements of it were reused in the Democrat&#39;s Owen-Glass bill in 1913, which became the Federal Reserve Act.</p>

<p>Did anybody else notice this contradiction? Rivero says that the meeting has &quot;the aim of placing complete control of the United States money supply once again under the control of private bankers.&quot; But the sentence just before that was &quot;Following Lincoln&#39;s assassination, the Greenbacks were pulled from circulation and <strong>the American people forced to go back to an economy based on bank notes borrowed at interest from the private bankers.</strong>&quot; So we already had currency from private bankers!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Owing to hostility over the previous banks, the name was changed to &quot;The Federal Reserve&quot; system in order to grant the new bank a quasi-governmental image, but in fact it is a privately owned bank, no more &quot;Federal&quot; than Federal Express. In fact, last year, the Federal Reserve successfully rebuffed a Freedom of Information lawsuit by Bloomberg News, on the ground that, as a private banking corporation, and not actually a part of the federal government, the Freedom of Information Act did not apply to operators of the Federal Reserve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve is a <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/">federal agency</a>. The 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks are legally separate from the federal government and have a mixture of private and public control, but they are nothing like any other private corporation. If you find out about the complicated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System">structure of the Federal Reserve system</a>, you&#39;ll see how different it is.</p>

<p>Bloomberg News was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P._v._Board_of_Governors_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System">successful in their lawsuit</a>, not the Federal Reserve.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1913 proved to be a transformative year for the nation&#39;s economy, first with the passage of the 16th &quot;income tax&quot; Amendment and the false claim that it had been ratified.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Law_that_Never_Was#Legal_status_of_Benson.27s_claims">Don&#39;t try that argument with your own taxes!</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Later that same year, and apparently unwilling to risk another questionable amendment, Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act over Christmas holiday 1913, while members of Congress opposed to the measure were at home.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While it&#39;s true that almost 30 senators had already left town, an earlier version of the bill had passed the Senate a few days earlier <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A07E1D6103FE633A25753C2A9649D946296D6CF">by a vote of 54 to 34</a>, a 20 vote margin. The final vote was 46 to 25, almost exactly the same margin. Five minutes of research on the web would have shown Rivero this wasn&#39;t true, but he doesn&#39;t care.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a very underhanded deal, as the Constitution explicitly vests Congress with the authority to issue the public currency, does not authorize its delegation, and thus should have required a new Amendment to transfer that authority to a private bank.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In an early draft of the Constitution, Congress was given the power to
&quot;emit bills of credit&quot;—that is, print paper currency—but 
that was <a href="http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/the-constitution-and-paper-money">debated at the Constitutional Convention and the power was
removed</a>.</p>

<p>This left Congress with only the power to &quot;<strong>coin</strong> money, regulate the
value thereof, and of foreign coin.&quot;</p>

<p>Did the federal government have the power to issue currency? The Supreme Court had declared the federal government&#39;s legal tender laws unconstitutional in 1870, but relented in 1871.</p>

<p>By contrast, the power of Congress to charter banks was never ruled unconstitutional and was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCulloch_v._Maryland">explicitly affirmed by the Supreme Court in 1819.</a></p>

<p>Not only had the first Bank of the United States and the second Bank of the United States issued currency, so had all of the national banks created under Lincoln&#39;s national bank system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But pass it Congress did, and President Woodrow Wilson signed it as he promised the bankers he would in exchange for generous campaign contributions. Wilson later regretted that decision.</p>

<p>&quot;I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is now controlled by its system of credit. We are no longer a government by free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.&quot; -- Woodrow Wilson 1919</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first two sentences —  &quot;I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country.&quot; — are not from Wilson. They were not attributed to Wilson until 30 years after his death. <a href="http://www.salon.com/2007/12/21/woodrow_wilson_federal_reserve/">Wilson was proud of the Federal Reserve until the day he died.</a></p>

<p>The rest of the quote come from two different campaign speeches (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MW8SAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA185&amp;amp;dq=%22A+great+industrial+nation%22">[1]</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MW8SAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA201&amp;amp;dq=%22no+longer+a+government%22">[2]</a>) in 1912, where he was promising to reform the monetary and banking system in the country, a promise he fulfilled with the creation of the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>Rivero states </p>

<blockquote>
<p>After the revolution, the new United States adopted a radically different economic system in which the government issued its own value-based money...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it didn&#39;t. During the Revolution, the U.S. issued <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_American_currency#Continental_currency">continental
currency</a>, which ended up being worthless. The bad experience with that led to the Constitution banning states from creating legal tender paper money and did not give Congress the power to create it, either.</p>

<p>Americans uses gold and silver coins along with bank notes issued by state-chartered private banks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just one year after Mayer Amschel Rothschild had uttered his infamous &quot;Let me issue and control a nation&#39;s money and I care not who makes the laws&quot;, the bankers succeeded in setting up a new Private Central Bank called the First Bank of the United States, largely through the efforts of the Rothschild&#39;s chief US supporter, Alexander Hamilton.</p>

<p>Founded in 1791, by the end of its twenty year charter the First Bank of the United States had almost ruined the nation&#39;s economy, while enriching the bankers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, no Rothschild ever said that. Back in the early 20th century, T. Cushing Daniel said that this was a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=zqkfAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;pg=RA2-PA6&amp;amp;dq=%22let+us+control+the+money+of+a+country%22">&quot;maxim of the money lenders of the Old World&quot;</a>, but he didn&#39;t mean that they literally said that. By the 1930s, though, it had been attributed to a Rothschild. Over the years, it&#39;s been attributed to at least three different Rothschilds, but never with a source.</p>

<p>More importantly, the Rothschilds were local to Frankfurt in 1791, so Alexander Hamilton could hardly have been a supporter of them. It&#39;s very unlikely that he ever heard of them before his death in 1805.</p>

<p>But most importantly, the economy wasn&#39;t ruined at all. The real, per capita GDP <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/usgdp/">grew 42%</a> during the twenty years of the first Bank of the United States. That&#39;s a health 1.76% growth per year.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Congress refused to renew the charter and signaled their intention to go back to a state issued value based currency on which the people paid no interest at all to any banker.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Congress didn&#39;t renew the charter, but we kept on using the same money: gold and silver coins as well as bank notes from state-chartered private banks. Rivero is confused about people paying interest on currency.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This resulted in a threat from Nathan Mayer Rothschild against the US Government, &quot;Either the application for renewal of the charter is granted, or the United States will find itself involved in a most disastrous war.&quot; Congress still refused to renew the charter for the First Bank of the United States, whereupon Nathan Mayer Rothschild railed, &quot;Teach those impudent Americans a lesson! Bring them back to colonial status!&quot;</p>

<p>Financed at virtually no interest by the Rothschild controlled Bank of England, Britain then launched the war of 1812 to recolonize the United States and force them back into the slavery of the Bank of England, or to plunge the United States into so much debt they would be forced to accept a new private central bank. And the plan worked. Even though the War of 1812 was won by the United States, Congress was forced to grant a new charter for yet another private bank issuing the public currency as loans at interest, the Second Bank of the United States.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow. This is stunningly wrong. Every single sentence of this is false.</p>

<ul>
<li>Those quotes are pure hokum, made up more than 150 years after the war.</li>
<li>Nathan Rothschild was not a powerful person until <em>after</em> 1815. He was
in no position to demand that the U.S. or Britain do anything.</li>
<li><strong>The United States started the War of 1812,</strong> not Britain. Read any fucking history book!</li>
<li>The United States did not win the war, At best it could be called a draw, but that&#39;s really something we tell the schoolchildren so they don&#39;t feel too bad.</li>
<li>Again, Rivero is confused about &quot;currency as loans at interest.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>In reality, the national debt decreased while the second Bank of the United States was around, just as happened with the first Bank of the United States.</p>

<p>In fact, the national debt was completely paid off while the second Bank of the United States was around: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/xjEZt">http://imgur.com/a/xjEZt</a></p>

<p><strong>This is really important, because it shows just how wrong Rivero is about the banks.</strong> Please look at <a href="http://imgur.com/a/xjEZt">these graphs</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that&#39;s what is actually happening. Mars once had a hot molten iron core like we did, and it cooled down over time. We know things cool down over time, and our earth is cooling down. So he&#39;s not wrong, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s something we really have to worry about <em>right</em> now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve wondered that myself. Their problem, and our ace in the hole, is that they still have to <em>appear</em> to be the good guys. They need their plausible deniability -- &quot;unsafe content&quot; errors once in a while won&#39;t arise suspicion, but fencing off individuals likely will. If their corruption becomes widely known, they are sunk. They need to tread lightly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need to exclude the bankers from our dealings. We need to operate outside the current system, as BRICS is doing.</p>

<p>Imagine a bank just for farmers that gives back to the farming community. It is an ethical institution that benefits those who invest there and gives back to the trade the institution is designed for.</p>

<p>We can do this.</p>

<p>Fuck the bankers. </p>
