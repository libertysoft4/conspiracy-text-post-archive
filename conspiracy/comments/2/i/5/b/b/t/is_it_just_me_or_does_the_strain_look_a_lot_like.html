        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the FX series The Strain, a zombie-like vampire strain is transported to New York via airplane. People get paid off, bribed, and threatened until it&#39;s spreading like wildfire and communications are shut off for the entire city. Still, even after all that, people don&#39;t believe what&#39;s happening. One of the things said over and over is about how your loved ones come back to infect you.</p>

<p>The same could be said about a lot of movies that pertain to epidemics (namely the movie Contagion).</p>

<p>Predictive programming, yeah?</p>

<p>EDIT: It&#39;s also rather funny they include the traditional &quot;Nazi&#39;s are the bad guy&quot; trope. Classic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s based on a book that came out 5 years ago. It was a vampire story designed to catch on with the zombie craze at the time. So if you wanna make a predictive programming claim, do it about the zombie craze. The Strain has little that makes it stand out itself as predictive programming.</p>

<p>Although I did find something interesting. Back when I was active on the Anonymous IRC, when Occupy was happening, we were all discussing what the next big hack should be. I had come up with the idea of hijacking the Emergency Broadcast System. </p>

<p>It was funny to see that idea pop up in the show, when it wasn&#39;t present in the book. In the book, it was the eclipse that was fucking with everyone&#39;s communications. There was no hacker plot-line. </p>

<p>I think Contagion was a much likelier candidate for predictive programming. Watch that movie again, and look at how many corporate logos pop up, and which ones. </p>

<p>I&#39;d wager the same could be said about EVERY big sickness film or show. </p>

<p>Widespread threat is practically only way you can make these types of film entertaining. </p>

<p>If a film&#39;s plot had people reacting immediately and appropriately, the film would be over before half an hour. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If people weren&#39;t reacting realistically in the show, it would be a terrible show and no one would watch it. It doesn&#39;t take a psychic to know how people would react during/what would cause a widespread outbreak, it just takes a very basic understanding of human nature and disease. Ever played the game Plague? The game makers didn&#39;t randomly predict what would happen during a widespread outbreak and then turn out to be right, they used science and research to make a hyper realistic game, same concept. </p>

<p>Tl;Dr: All movies about contagions and wide spread disease are similar because the people making the movies did some research. That&#39;s it.</p>

<p>But smallpox....fuck smallpox. We have zero immunity globally as a species, and if that got out, especially some genetically modified version of it, it&#39;s hard to overestimate the damage. It could reach an extinction-level-event, like Stephen King&#39;s The Stand plot. Billions could die. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The vampires contaminate other people by bodily fluids - either by directly biting them with those tongue-stings or by splattering people with that nasty white blood full of worms (when people engage in &quot;direct contact&quot; with them during fights).</p>

<p>The vampires are often covered in blood or have blood dripping from their mouths. Sure that is from their victims, but anyway it kind of resembles some Ebola pictures.</p>

<p>Often the vampires appear letargic or dead and then &quot;come back to life&quot;. We have seen the same mechanics hapenning in some isolated ebola cases since last week.</p>

<p>So yes, I would say that there is at least a passing resemblance.</p>
