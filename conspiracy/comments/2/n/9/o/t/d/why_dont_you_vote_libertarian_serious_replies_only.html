<p>After all, what good is knowing about a conspiracy if you don&#39;t focus on potential solutions?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m looking for the negatives (in your opinion) of voting for the libertarian party exclusively.  </p>

<p>Or course I can ask my question to, <a href="/r/libertarian">/r/libertarian</a>, but I don’t know if they’d be as likely to give me real negatives.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are no solutions, only theories, as anyone who opposes the present system in any meaningful way lack the power or monetary backing to affect change.<br/>
As for supporting the libertarian platform, more appropriately called the Tea Party, means largely supporting neoliberalism, which I&#39;m opposed to. Supporting representatives who are almost wholly incapable of even a modicum of rationality, see Palin or most anything Ryan has proposed.<br/>
Also, there is the problem that the entire &quot;movement&quot; was funded, backed, and created by the Koch kingmakers masquerading as a grassroots movement. It was a lie from the very beginning.<br/>
And I&#39;m not in agreement with ayn rand or what libertarians consider &quot;philosophy&quot; for the most part.<br/>
&quot;Non-aggression&quot; seems like an ideal solution at face value, but that&#39;s largely not how human relations are modeled.<br/>
Largely, I&#39;m not an ideologue, and I lean more towards the pragmatic, but any kind of movement that relies so rigidly to an ideology that their solution to anything and everything boils down to the exact same dogma every time, in my opinion, that&#39;s not a political party, that&#39;s a cult. Which, to be fair, most political parties model to some extent. </p>

<p>All the other posters use tired excuses (removing government &quot;regulation&quot; of things like EPA and what not, claiming suddenly we&#39;ll all live in polluted waters and air, because we certainly don&#39;t already /s).</p>

<p>On one hand, anon&#39;s here will tell us how corrupted the R&#39;s or the D&#39;s are, but then refuse to try another 3rd party for the same fears. Why bother participating then?</p>

<p>Anyways, the negatives are the same reasons rehashed for any voting party: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>politics</p></li>
<li><p>in bed with corporations</p></li>
<li><p>corrupted</p></li>
<li><p>wasted effort</p></li>

<p>I think most politicians in general are corrupted or become corrupted by the system. I vote L because it&#39;s one of the only parties that hasn&#39;t had a go and has a pretty decent idea of how the government should be in the relationship of people vs. state. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie Sanders wanted single payer so no person in America ever went bankrupt again from a healthcare crisis.  He compromised only to get 14 million more people covered with insurance in essence directly saving lives as opposed to bitching that nothing was getting done.  I&#39;m sure you are fine with the system of corruption we have in place with the for profit healthcare system though.  You are in the minority.  Are you a let-everyone-poor-die-because-you-are-well-off-and-they-are-not-o-tarian?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only negatives I ever hear about libertarians is people thinking they are for Socialism (which is historically, always by force) or just generally not knowing what Libertarianism really is.</p>

<p>Or those who believe you can&#39;t vote for third party because it will split the votes and hand it to the Dem or Rep that you don&#39;t like.</p>

<p>These are the only reasons I ever see given.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe you&#39;re referring to the mainstream media portrayal of the tea party. Yes, that faction took over the message, but earlier in it&#39;s existence it was a grassroots upwelling of populist candidates running for office. We largely don&#39;t support Palin. Just thought I&#39;d throw that out there for you. </p>
