<p><a href="http://truedemocracyparty.net/2011/09/vapor-fuel-system-tom-ogle-full-story/">http://truedemocracyparty.net/2011/09/vapor-fuel-system-tom-ogle-full-story/</a></p>

<p>&quot;...he had discovered his fuel system by accident; “I was messing around with a lawn-mower when I accidentally knocked a hole in its fuel tank. I put a vacuum line running from the tank straight into the carburetor inlet. I just let it run and it kept running and running but the fuel level stayed the same. I got excited. The lawn-mower was running without a carburetor and getting tremendous efficiency.”
The engine got so hot Ogle used a fan to cool it and was amazed when it ran 96 hours on the fuel remaining in the mower’s small tank.
He went from the lawn-mower to the automobile, converting a car in the same manner. Its engine started immediately, but the gas tank collapsed inwards. It took months of reinforcing gas tanks before he solved the vacuum problem.
But the car, without its carburetor and fuel pump, still had no acceleration. It couldn’t run faster than 20 mph. And the modified engine averaged only 8 miles to the gallon, and stalled after a few miles.
One time he crawled under the stalled car to examine its gas tank and found, “It was freezing cold, like an ice-cube. As I was sucking vapor out, it was acting like a refrigerator with liquid on the bottom and fumes on top.”
When he warmed the gas tank with heater coils, the miles per gallon sky-rocketed to over 100 and Tom Ogle never looked back.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pardon me, but that whole story is fucking stupid.  The energetics of gasoline engines are well known.   Gasoline only has so much energy available (admittedly it&#39;s quite a bit), and no matter how you vaporize it you aren&#39;t going to improve efficiency by a factor of 4 over a conventional motor.</p>

<p>Stories like the &quot;magic carburetor&quot; (of which this is a variant) exist because people like to believe conspiracy stories.  Many conspiracy stories turn out to be true, but also many of them turn out to be complete horseshit.  This is one of the latter.  If it were so easy to quadruple the energetic output of a gasoline engine, everyone would be doing it.</p>

<p>As an example, consider a similarly simple hack from the 1970s that yielded a much smaller result: when the Feds required seat belt warning buzzers in cars, folks rapidly learned how to unplug the sensors from the seats, turning off the buzzers.   If quadrupling your gas mileage were as simple as running a vacuum line into the fuel tank, every shade-tree mechanic in the nation would have done it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I call bullshit.</p>

<p>I work on small engines as a sideline to flying and have NEVER seen an external vacuum line EVER on &quot;a lawnmower engine&quot;...unless the engine was big enough to have Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV). That&#39;s about 20-24HP. Usually more. Hardly a &quot;lawnmower engine.&quot;</p>

<p>Even barring THAT and saying this was a &quot;one of a kind&quot; motor two questions arise:</p>

<p>How did the engine run without the correct fuel/air stoichiometry?</p>

<p>WHAT THE HELL got the fuel so cold (in the &quot;car&quot; he &quot;converted&quot;)??? If the tank was hot cold air or water would crush it. When this was in a car NOTHING should have pulled fuel temp that low.</p>

<p>This is nothing but an urban legend, sorry folks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tom ogle&#39;s invention was one of countless fuel vaporizer inventions that have been created. This knowledge goes back to the early 1900&#39;s. Every single one of those inventions were &quot;urban legends&quot; also? Did you watch the video or do any research of anykind?
you&#39;ve never seen an external vacuum line on a mower engine? I have. There&#39;s nothing complex about it.
what made the gas tank cold?
it&#39;s basic knowledge that vacuum drops temperature.
stochiometry? That&#39;s a big word. You mean fuel and air ratio? That is easily achieved with a simple adjustment valve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah stoichiometric mixtures. Yes, it&#39;s true that all modern car engines run a stoichiometric air-fuel mixture.</p>

<p>But they could actually run a lot leaner than this and get higher fuel mileage. Why isn&#39;t this done? Mostly because the leaner mixture burns a lot hotter and create nitrogen oxides as a by product. These compounds are bad for the environment. </p>

<p>If someone could come up with a decent way to eliminate NOx compounds associated with lean burn engines, we could all easily be driving around getting 80 or 90 mpg highway.</p>

<p>One other interesting possibility. Carbs and fuel injectors turn gasoline into a spray. This means the gas itself is still in the form of tiny droplets. The way the story reads. it might be possible that Ogle had found a way to heat the gasoline into a very rich vapor. Instead of small droplets, he might have reduced the gasoline right down to a sort of molecular fog.</p>

<p>This would probably burn far more efficiently than any carburetor of the day. Possibly much better than even today&#39;s high pressure fuel injection systems.</p>

<p>So a system that turns gasoline into a fog, burning at  a very lean fuel air ratio? Ogle might well have been getting fuel efficiency several times better than the factory mileage. In the early 70&#39;s, many cars only got about 20 mpg on the highway. Ogle might well have been able to achieve 70 or 80 mpg. I can see some exaggeration turning that into 200 mpg.</p>

<p>A couple of other things. Turning the fuel into a fog by heating it requires heating elements in close proximity to the fuel tank. Not something most car companies want to try (lawsuit potential).</p>

<p>The temperature drop with the fuel could easily be the result of a pressure drop. If Ogle was indeed turning the fuel into a molecular fog, and this fog had  a bit of pressure... that pressure would have dropped if the fuel was being burned faster than the fog was forming. Any pressure drop in a closed container has a temperature drop associated with it. Next time you cook with propane on a BBQ, look at the propane tank. Sometimes the pressure will drop fast enough that frost will form on the sides of the tank even in the summertime.</p>

<p>WHAT THE HELL got the fuel so cold </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vacuum boils and also freezes liquids simultaneously. He&#39;d have needed to create a complete vacuum to boil the fuel as it froze, which would be difficult, but it&#39;s a neat effect of vacuum on liquids.  I have no idea how that would improve mileage, but vacuum effects on water temperate and physical state are high school experiments everybody should have conducted at some point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This basically boils down to the fuel vapor molecule size.  Most modern engines spray gasoline as mist with droplets varying in size, but there is no requirement to spray mist.  A gas vapor is much easier to ignite too.</p>

<p>The modern car engine actually runs at a terrible efficiency until the motor warms up, after about 30 minutes. </p>

<p>This I could think of an answer for, the evaporation, expansion, and liquidification of chemicals that react to temperatures differently than water is the entire Bases of modern refrigeration. </p>

<p>So the effect of recycling the vapor, (liquid to gas and back again) could of turned the gas tank into an inadvertent refrigerator. </p>

<p>As to the rest of it, I have no clue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but NONE of those chems are in there by his own admission!!!</p>

<p>You would need, at the least, a liquefied fuel source that was COLD (think butane) and that would be SO fucking unsafe it would be mindblowing.</p>

<p>He&#39;s using no refrigeration so HOW can he get the EXHAUST of an IC engine to RUN COLD??? It cannot be done without intercoolers.</p>

<p>I want to believe and know you do too! But take it from me...this is bullshit.</p>

<p>And nobody has answered my question!!! SHOW ME a small Honda engine like he uses (to be generous let&#39;s say 3.5 to 6 HP) that &quot;has a vacuum tube&quot; anywhere on the engine. I have never, ever seen one in 22+ years unless it was used to automatically open a fuel petcock when the fuel valve senses vacuum. And I&#39;ve only seen THOSE on motorcycles and some large (&gt;24HP) Briggs engines.</p>

<p>Good luck looking...they don&#39;t exist. That engine is free from most emissions requirements so crank ventilation is not needed. Period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should take a class in chemistry before you start acting like a chemical reaction expert.   You clearly no nothing about chemical reactions when you think that you must have a cold fuel source for an endothermic reaction to take place.    Maybe before you act like you know anything about chemistry you should take a class because you do not even understand the chemical reaction that takes place in the most basic of reactions.   </p>

<p>You lack basic reading comprehension.  You say that no small honda engine like he uses would have a vacuum tube.  But since you cannot be bothered to READ the article Ill quote it for you.  “I was messing around with a lawn-mower when I accidentally knocked a hole in its fuel tank. I put a vacuum line running from the tank straight into the carburetor inlet.&quot;  No were does he say he had an engine with a vacuum tube.   HE SAYS HE PUT THE VACUUM TUBE THERE.  So how about you take 15 mins out of trolling and actually read the content.  </p>

<p>TL;DR  Your a troll who did not even read the article and knows nothing about chemistry.  </p>

<p>Science that you know is incomplete and down right false in many areas.
universities are stuck in a constrained mode of thinking. they&#39;re stuck in a very small box.
pride and prestige sadly gets in the way of the search for scientific truth.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard too many stories of corruption and deception in higher education, it got to the point where my faith in the education system was totally destroyed.</p>

<p>if you look into this far enough you&#39;ll come to realize how deep the deception goes. it was hard for me to believe at first, but the conclusions are inescapable.</p>

<p>That you&#39;re lumping ALL research groups from ALL universities into such a generalizing statement is, well, disingenuous. I do get that science-derived knowledge is incomplete and at times false, but isn&#39;t that a fundamental tenet of any knowledge-producing system/paradigm?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve heard too many stories of corruption and deception in higher education, it got to the point where my faith in the education system was totally destroyed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you elaborate on this corruption and deception? Have you worked in a lab where you&#39;ve seen this happen?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>pride and prestige sadly gets in the way of the search for scientific truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would agree that academia is bloated, inefficient, and will likely change drastically in the next century. However using phrases like &quot;search for scientific truth,&quot; to me, indicates an outsiders&#39; ill-nuanced view on an industry -- an armchair quarterback of sorts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the conclusions are inescapable</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are precious few conclusions that are &quot;inescapable,&quot; and DB Larson&#39;s claims are about as far from it as possible. Reciprocal theory has been tested, refuted, then supporters of it move the goalposts, and repeat.</p>

Edit 
That is to say it could be very widely used but isn&#39;t a miracle either,  I would expect a good improvement in say small engines for large vehicles though.  Probably cut quite a bit of wasted fuel use out of start and stop driving commuting which is a huge factor for drivers.</p>

They told him they can&#39;t use it because the economic system is not ready. It was proven to work but they said no, Back in 1960&#39;s and 70&#39;s. End of story just like that.

<p>with this kind of energy technology no one single person or group can benefit. money doesnt belong with it. that is how oil works. poeple are made to believe that there is scarcity in the world.
but this is not true. it all a lie.
it is free energy, energy to free people from slavery.
this technology cant be patented, owned, or withheld. it cant be used as a tool, as oil is, to control people.
it is the equalizer. it brings balance into the world.
No government or corporation would willingly bring such a thing into this world. 
they desire power over others, not freedom and equality.</p>

<p>the free energy tech is hidden because it would topple the monetary system of inequality to the ground.
No more money.
imagine that.
that is what has to happen.</p>

<p>Yes, once a technology is known, others will steal it or not pay royalties and licensing fees.  But there still is plenty of money and prestige to be made from being first, and being the inventor.  Wouldn&#39;t China or North Korea or Cuba just LOVE to be able to say &quot;see, our system is best, we produced this amazing new breakthrough, while the capitalist running-dog pigs couldn&#39;t do it&quot; ?

    <div class="md"><p>there&#39;s hundreds of stories about government suppression. A good example, look into Ralph Ring and Otis Carr. A documented case where the FBI Strolled right into their research lab and shut them down. The reason: &quot;this technology poses a threat to the monetary system of the United States.&quot; is that constitutional? gov. doesn&#39;t give a shit, they do whatever they want with no accountability.
That case alone should have made people stand up and say enough.
This shits out there and not hard to find. problem is people don&#39;t care and just like to live in la la land.</p>

<p>All engines are highly optimized nowadays and a loaded vehicle or towing Yada Yada even accelerating hard still uses a rich mixture that never changed. It got less rich and emissions controls were added but the fuel is still going in the cylinder.</p>
