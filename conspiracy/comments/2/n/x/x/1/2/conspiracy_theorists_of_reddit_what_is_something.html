    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve looked into it quite a bit, being a UFO nut.</p>

<p>Honestly, some of the evidence I&#39;ve seen was compelling, but keep in mind this was during JFK&#39;s time, a man that dies because he tried to save us from the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>Now, the kid that JFK &quot;randomly&quot; spoke to that when asked, &quot;what would you like to see America do?&quot;. answered, &quot;go to the moon&quot;, I&#39;ll bet he was a plant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t claim to know the intricate details of JFK&#39;s presidency or what knowledge he did or didn&#39;t have of the Apollo missions.  All I know is the evidence that&#39;s out there (or lack thereof) and the official story we were told.  Also keep in mind that all of the Apollo missions took place <em>after</em> JFK was dead so really what impact he had on the missions themselves was only preliminary in nature.  When you really look at it, there is actually very little in the way of evidence and there are numerous holes in the story.</p>

<p>For instance, here&#39;s a pretty easy one: the Moon is close to 250,000 miles away from Earth.  Assuming speed of light travel, the radio waves transmitting the communications between the astronauts and mission control would&#39;ve taken well over 2 seconds to be transmitted, received, sent back, received (roughly 1.25 seconds from Moon to Earth and then from Earth to Moon).  So when you listen to the audio, how is it possible that there is no delay whatsoever?  It&#39;s abundantly clear when you listen to it that there isn&#39;t any - it&#39;s as if two people are having a casual conversation over the phone.  The only pauses are natural pauses when someone is thinking of a response or has nothing to say.</p>

<p>It literally just isn&#39;t possible.  But if it is, please explain to me how.  And there are dozens (if not hundreds) of other anomalies like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No idea, maybe they cut it to make it more interesting?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say this; if we left a flag on the moon, how come I&#39;ve never seen a photo of the flag outside of that trip?</p>

<p>You would think it would be the most popular photo.  I mean, what else is there to take a picture of on the moon?  Not a satellite, not an armature astrologer, nothing.  We just have to have faith the flag is there.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I would think that this information would have gotten out at some point over the last 40+ years and as far as I&#39;m aware it hasn&#39;t.  Not sure why they would do this anyway as having the delays would have made it sound more authentic (if it in fact was) and would have prevented people such as myself from noticing the obvious absurdity of it.</p>

<p>And yes, the &quot;flag&quot; is suspicious as well although I would add that a flag being on the Moon in and of itself doesn&#39;t prove that a human stepped foot there, especially with all of the other unexplained and contradictory details.  If I can put on my tin foil hat for a second, I could easily see information about a flag being &quot;withheld&quot; purposely. Then, a few years from now (when more people are questioning NASA&#39;s official story say), we finally are given a better photo of the flag by NASA and this is used as &quot;definitive proof&quot; that we went to the Moon despite the fact that it&#39;s only evidence that <em>something</em> made it there.  A probe or unmanned craft could easily leave something behind.</p>

<p>NASA still does not have the technology to protect humans from the worst of it (certainly not 60 years ago), pretty much saying the Apollo 11 project was a fakery. Several videos discuss this, including some NASA and other experts: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpcpSGmMuZ0">here&#39;s one</a>.</p>

<p>Why did they do it? I&#39;m not even sure at this point but I don&#39;t think the &quot;why&quot; matters at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I don&#39;t believe in 95% of the conspiracies posted here.</p>

<p>There are actually very few I do believe in.  And I think the word believe is misused in this situation, there are very few conspiracies that I think are worth serious consideration, I think all theories are worth a passing consideration.  Which is what I do 95% of the time, I look at a theory, consider it, decide I&#39;m not interested or &quot;convinced&quot; and then I pass on it.</p>

<p>Sometimes when I&#39;m not convinced I&#39;ll see something new on that theory down the road, I&#39;ll reconsider it, and return to step 1.  Other times I may not be convinced but I find myself very interested, so I&#39;ll go out of my way to dig up more information on the people, places and events that are tangentially connected.</p>

<p>Being interested and convinced are two very different things.</p>

<p>For example I&#39;m very interested in the 9-11 theories because the event has major global ramifications, but I&#39;m not very convinced by them.  Of course I&#39;m not very convinced by the official story either.</p>

<p>Such is life.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is that I&#39;m not religious in my belief or disbelief of anything.  </p>

<p>If Satan sprang out of a lantern right now I wouldn&#39;t be shocked, my world view would shift on dozens of issues and I would return to step 1.</p>

<p>Likewise if we had found a monolith on the comet that was recently visited by the European space agency, I wouldn&#39;t be shocked.  My world view would shift on dozens of issues and I would return to step 1.</p>

<p>There is a fundamental difference between not caring and not being irrationally attached to certain ideas.  This gives me a flexibility of thought that causes most people to hate me or fear me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think most people view it as one group aggressively targeting another.</p>

<p>I do believe many people have prejudices and stereotypical views of certain demographics. When people are put into situations (often non-friendly) with a person from said group, tensions can escalate quickly.</p>

<p>For example, there is a white officer who has a stereotypical view of black people as being lazy, ignorant, rude, and uneducated. He may not pull black people over simply because of their skin color, but he will be far less tolerant of their resistance and back talk. Being that the officer is not fond of black people and finds the black driver &quot;acting in the stereotype,&quot; he is less likely to deescalate the situation and more likely to &quot;assert authority forcibly&quot;.</p>

<p>Many of us have been at family gatherings and seen people with such views, voicing them fairly loudly. You think police officers are exempt from having their own preconceived notions about people and acting upon them?</p>
