<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysander_Spooner">Lysander Spooner</a>, 1870</p>

<p>...In Europe, the nominal rulers, the emperors and kings and parliaments, are anything but the real rulers of their respective countries. They are little or nothing else than mere tools, employed by the wealthy to rob, enslave, and (if need be) murder those who have less wealth, or none at all.</p>

<p>The Rothschilds, and that class of money-lenders of whom they are the representatives and agents – men who never think of lending a shilling to their next-door neighbors, for purposes of honest industry, unless upon the most ample security, and at the highest rate of interest – stand ready, at all times, to lend money in unlimited amounts to those robbers and murderers, who call themselves governments, to be expended in shooting down those who do not submit quietly to being robbed and enslaved.</p>

<p>They lend their money in this manner, knowing that it is to be expended in murdering their fellow men, for simply seeking their liberty and their rights; knowing also that neither the interest nor the principal will ever be paid, except as it will be extorted under terror of the repetition of such murders as those for which the money lent is to be expended.</p>

<p>These money-lenders, the Rothschilds, for example, say to themselves: If we lend a hundred millions sterling to the queen and parliament of England, it will enable them to murder twenty, fifty, or a hundred thousand people in England, Ireland, or India; and the terror inspired by such wholesale slaughter, will enable them to keep the whole people of those countries in subjection for twenty, or perhaps fifty, years to come; to control all their trade and industry; and to extort from them large amounts of money, under the name of taxes; and from the wealth thus extorted from them, they (the queen and parliament) can afford to pay us a higher rate of interest for our money than we can get in any other way. Or, if we lend this sum to the emperor of Austria, it will enable him to murder so many of his people as to strike terror into the rest, and thus enable him to keep them in subjection, and extort money from them, for twenty or fifty years to come. And they say the same in regard to the emperor of Russia, the king of Prussia, the emperor of France, or any other ruler, so called, who, in their judgment, will be able, by murdering a reasonable portion of his people, to keep the rest in subjection, and extort money from them, for a long time to come, to pay the interest and the principal of the money lent him.</p>

<p>And why are these men so ready to lend money for murdering their fellow men? Solely for this reason, viz., that such loans are considered better investments than loans for purposes of honest industry. They pay higher rates of interest; and it is less trouble to look after them. This is the whole matter.</p>

<p>The question of making these loans is, with these lenders, a mere question of pecuniary profit. They lend money to be expended in robbing, enslaving, and murdering their fellow men, solely because, on the whole, such loans pay better than any others. They are no respecters of persons, no superstitious fools, that reverence monarchs. They care no more for a king, or an emperor, than they do for a beggar, except as he is a better customer, and can pay them better interest for their money. If they doubt his ability to make his murders successful for maintaining his power, and thus extorting money from his people in future, they dismiss him unceremoniously as they would dismiss any other hopeless bankrupt, who should want to borrow money to save himself from open insolvency.</p>

<p>When these great lenders of blood-money, like the Rothschilds, have loaned vast sums in this way, for purposes of murder, to an emperor or a king, they sell out the bonds taken by them, in small amounts, to anybody, and everybody, who are disposed to buy them at satisfactory prices, to hold as investments. They (the Rothschilds) thus soon get back their money, with great profits; and are now ready to lend money in the same way again to any other robber and murderer, called an emperor or king, who, they think, is likely to be successful in his robberies and murders, and able to pay a good price for the money necessary to carry them on.</p>

<p>This business of lending blood-money is one of the most thoroughly sordid, cold-blooded, and criminal that was ever carried on, to any considerable extent, amongst human beings. It is like lending money to slave traders, or to common robbers and pirates, to be repaid out of their plunder. And the men who loan money to governments, so called, for the purpose of enabling the latter to rob, enslave, and murder their people, are among the greatest villains that the world has ever seen. And they as much deserve to be hunted and killed (if they cannot otherwise be got rid of) as any slave traders, robbers, or pirates that ever lived.</p>

<p>When  these emperors and kings, so-called, have obtained their loans, they proceed to hire and train immense numbers of professional murderers, called soldiers, and employ them in shooting down all who resist their demands for money. In fact, most of them keep large bodies of these murderers constantly in their service, as their only means of enforcing their extortions. There are now, I think, four or five millions of these professional murderers constantly employed by the so-called sovereigns of Europe. The enslaved people are, of course, forced to support and pay all these murderers, as well as to submit to all the other extortions which these murderers are employed to enforce.</p>

<p>It is only in this way that most of the so-called governments of Europe are maintained. These so-called governments are in reality only great bands of robbers and murderers, organized, disciplined, and constantly on the alert. And the so-called sovereigns, in these different governments, are simply the heads, or chiefs, of different bands of robbers and murderers. And these heads or chiefs are dependent upon the lenders of blood-money for the means to carry on their robberies and murders. They could not sustain themselves a moment but for the loans made to them by these blood-money loan-mongers. And their first care is to maintain their credit with them; for they know their end is come, the instant their credit with them fails. Consequently the first proceeds of their extortions are scrupulously applied to the payment of the interest on their loans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my understanding:-</p>

<ol>
<li><p>True but that makes me assume you are simply hoping your tax evasion isn&#39;t discovered. I see no reason that you wouldn&#39;t be charged for tax evasion upon discovery of your nonpayment. </p></li>
<li><p>Assuming you are working legally, if you earn enough money to be eligible to pay tax and wilfully evade payment IRS records will show that you haven&#39;t paid. It would be extremely difficult to mount any kind of legitimate defence in the face of those figures. </p></li>
<li><p>Ignorance of the law is not an acceptable defence.</p></li>
<li><p>Not paying tax for political reasons is still evasion and a prison sentence is enforced regardless of subsequent payment. Ask Wesley Snipes or Lauryn Hill. </p></li>
<li><p>By living in the USA you live under the laws enforced by the US government, if you break a law you should assume that you will held accountable for your actions. Disagreeing with one of your country&#39;s laws is fine but it doesn&#39;t give you license to ignore it. </p></li>
<li><p>This is your ideology but it doesn&#39;t give you immunity from the USAs tax law.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I can understand someone disagreeing with a law or how their country is run but thinking that your political or ideological views gives you the right to break the law without consequence seems short sighted and downright foolish to me. It looks to me like an inefficient way for trying to effect change in your country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, it sill strikes me as a waste of your life. What change can you effect from prison? If you are a known figure then there can be something in this but as the unknown person you are it&#39;s throwing your life away cheaply. </p>

<p>Paying up once they proved your case isn&#39;t how it usually goes down either. In this case of wilful evasion it would be likely that back taxes and interest would be levied as well as a prison sentence. 
If you don&#39;t agree with the system of your home country that&#39;s fine but this action doesn&#39;t really do anything to change things in my opinion.  </p>

<p>4.) Whether or not I tie it to ethical considerations is irrelevant if they have no facts to support the legal opinion that their codes and laws apply to me. If they have no facts to support their claims that their codes and laws apply to me then my reasoning is just as irrelevant as their baseless claims against me.</p>

<p>5.) My location means that their codes and laws apply to me? What is the connection? </p>

<p>If they&#39;re going to claim that I violated their codes they must first produce facts that would suport their claim that their codes and laws apply to me.

<p>TITLE 26 &gt; Subtitle A &gt; CHAPTER 1 &gt; Subchapter A &gt; PART I &gt; § 2</p>

<p>§ 2. Definitions and special rules</p>

<p>(e) For definition of <strong>taxable income</strong> see section 63.</p>

<p>TITLE 26 &gt; Subtitle A &gt; CHAPTER 1 &gt; Subchapter A &gt; PART I &gt; § 63</p>

<p>§63. <strong>Taxable income defined</strong></p>

<p>(a) In general</p>

<p>Except as provided in subsection (b), for purposes of this subtitle, the term <strong>“taxable income”</strong> <em>means</em> <strong>gross income</strong> minus...</p>

<p>(b) Individuals who do not itemize their deductions</p>

<p>In the case of an individual who does not elect to itemize their deductions for the taxable year, for purposes of this subtitle, the term <strong>“taxable income”</strong> <em>means</em> <strong>adjusted gross income</strong> minus...</p>

<p>TITLE 26 &gt; Subtitle A &gt; CHAPTER 1 &gt; Subchapter B &gt; PART I &gt; § 62</p>

<p>§62. <strong>Adjusted gross income defined</strong></p>

<p>(a) General rule</p>

<p>For purposes of this subtitle, the term <strong>“adjusted gross income”</strong> <em>means</em>, in the case of an individual, <strong>gross income</strong> minus...</p>

<p>TITLE 26 &gt; Subtitle A &gt; CHAPTER 1 &gt; Subchapter B &gt; PART I &gt; § 64</p>

<p>§64. <strong>Ordinary income defined</strong></p>

<p>For purposes of this subtitle, the term <strong>“ordinary income”</strong> <em>includes</em> (NOTE: does not say <em>means</em>) any gain from the sale or exchange of property...**</p>

<p>TITLE 26 &gt; Subtitle A &gt; CHAPTER 1 &gt; Subchapter B &gt; PART I &gt; § 61</p>

<p>§61. <strong>Gross income defined</strong></p>

<p>(a) General definition</p>

<p>Except as otherwise provided in this subtitle, <strong>gross income</strong> <em>means</em> all <strong>income</strong> from whatever source derived...**</p>

<p>In review:</p>

<p>§63a - <strong>“taxable income”</strong> <em>means</em> <strong>“gross income”</strong> minus...</p>

<p>§62a - <strong>“adjusted gross income”</strong> <em>means</em>, in the case of an individual, <strong>“gross income”</strong> minus...</p>

<p>§61a - <strong>“gross income”</strong> <em>means</em> all <strong>“income”</strong> from whatever source derived...</p>

<p>§??? - <strong>“income”</strong> <em>means</em> ?????............... <em>Nowhere to be found in The Internal Revenue Code!!!</em></p>

<p>These are the only definitions in Title 26, the Internal Revenue Code, that include the word “income” yet none of them actually define the word <strong>“income”</strong>. The definition of the word <strong>“income”</strong> does not exist in Title 26. </p>

<p><strong>U.S. v. Ballard, 535 F2d 400, cert denied, 429 U.S. 918, 50 L.Ed.2d 283, 97 S.Ct. 310 (1976) - &quot;...the general term &#39;income&#39; is not defined in the Internal Revenue Code...&quot;</strong></p>

<p>It should also be mentioned that &quot;from whatever source derived&quot; (also used in Title 26) makes it abundantly clear that wages and compensation for services are not &quot;income&quot; but are a <em>source</em> from which one <em>derives</em> income. Example: One receives $100 as compensation for services. Then one invests that $100. Any profit that is derived from that $100 investment is &quot;income&quot;. </p>

<p>Thus sayeth Title 26 and the 16th Amendment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it doesn&#39;t. That&#39;s a patently false proposition. People break the law, every day, with impunity. Corporations evade taxes with no accountability. Politicians, the privileged wealthy, &quot;police officers,&quot; legislators, lobbysists, and civil servants disregard the law of the land whenever it suits them.  </p>

<p>The legislature disregards the Constitution. As has most every executive and leader of a nation. </p>

<p>Every day, these things happen. If the &quot;law of the land applies to everyone who lives in it,&quot; then why are so many of the people charged with creating and administering the law not held accountable? If those who are elected to legislate hold no good faith in the supposed social contract of our nation, then why should the people? </p>

<p>The &quot;law&quot; only applies to those unfortunate souls who find themselves inconveniencing those who are privileged to hold the power. There is no true &quot;law&quot; but what one perceives and believes. </p>

<p>A person might find themselves subject to arrest, trial, judgment, and imprisonment, but it doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ve submitted themselves to the idea of breaking a law. It doesn&#39;t mean that law is a true &quot;law.&quot; It means they were held at gunpoint, kidnapped, judged, and thrown away to a cell. The law only exists in the minds of those who uphold it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t claimed any. </p>

<p>Your statement is that the law applies to all and that&#39;s not true. I don&#39;t wish to make assumptions about your country of origin, but I&#39;d like to describe a way in which this is shown to be false in the United States. </p>

<p>When George W Bush signed bills into law, he often used an executive function called &quot;signing statements&quot; to exempt his administration from the law which he just signed. This was an abuse of what is considered, by most legal scholars, a ceremonial act. I can assume that the current president has used that precedent to his advantage, as well, since W was never held accountable. </p>

<p>Representatives within the U.S. congress exempt themselves from laws all the time when they draw up legislation. Lobbyists who help fashion legislation draw up exemptions for their employers and then encourage their respective representatives to make those exemptions into law.</p>

<p>Law enforcement officers break the law, every day, and are not held accountable to the &quot;law.&quot;</p>

<p>This notion of &quot;law&quot; is simply whatever set of rules a privileged class has the capacity to hold over a less privileged class of people. The law did not come from God. It certainly doesn&#39;t come from the &quot;people.&quot; It comes from a privileged class of elite rulers and their friends. It has mostly, if not always, been this way. </p>

<p>I hold about as much regard for most current law as I hold for the laws written in Leviticus in the Old Testament. It&#39;s my hope that, one day, most other folks will cast off the superstition of the nation or government in the way they&#39;ve cast off superstition of religion.</p>

<p>Yes, you are correct. If I don&#39;t follow the rules, they can do whatever they like to me. They can detain, judge, imprison, kill, seize any of my property, remove my children, ruin my name, and whatever else the current authorities wish to to. </p>

<p>Their capacity to do this, however, is not proof of their legitimacy. </p>

<p>Look, I don&#39;t want to argue with you. I&#39;m simply trying to get across a point to you that you are refusing. You don&#39;t have to agree with the sentiment, but it&#39;d be nice to acknowledge the reasoning behind it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a pretty conservative fella. I pay taxes. I use the library. I look after my neighbors and folks I meet. I wish to serve folks. It&#39;s in my nature. I&#39;m in a monogamous marriage sanctioned by the state. I carry life, health, and auto insurance. My children have nine digit codes that prove their legitimacy as citizens. Hell, even their vaccinations are up to date, mostly. It just so happens, I do these things either of my own volition or under duress for exactly the reasons you&#39;ve mentioned. </p>

<p>So, i behave according to this so-called &quot;law&quot; not because it is legitimate but because the reach and violence of the state is almost inescapable and it because, well, I&#39;m a decent, non-violent person. </p>

<p>If there&#39;s a law I follow, it&#39;s the golden rule. Do we need more?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have views on citizenship and law which I don&#39;t fully understand. If you are genuinely not paying tax then I commend your commitment to your ideals but fail to see your argument that the tax laws &quot;don&#39;t apply to you&quot; as being a good defence in a court which is run according to the established laws of the country, not your interpretation or definition of them. </p>

<p>I would recommend, if you haven&#39;t already, talking to an accountant and a solicitor ASAP to get fully qualified information on what you are getting into. </p>

<p>You may also want to look up, if you haven&#39;t already, articles on &quot;birthright U.S. Citizenship&quot;  which applies to you point 5 and &quot;tax protester statutory arguments&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1.) The U.S. Supreme Court defined citizenship as &quot;A member of a body politic owing a duty of allegiance in exchange for a duty of protection; these are reciprocal obligations.&quot; (<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/231/9">Luria vs. U.S.</a> paragraph thirteen) This means that they owe me a duty of protection if it&#39;s to be a meaningful relationship.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_v._District_of_Columbia">No duty to protect</a>. Warren vs. D.C.</p>

<p><a href="http://decisions.courts.state.ny.us/fcas/fcas_docs/2013JUL/3001010882012002SCIV.pdf">No duty to protect</a>. Lozito vs. NYC</p>

<p>They breech their supposed duty every day of the week.</p>

<p>They give us nothing and so I owe them nothing.</p>

<p>2.) I am not going to argue anything. I am not going to put up a defense. The burden of proof rests on the plaintiff. If they&#39;re going to accuse me of violating their codes and laws then they must prove, factually, that their codes and laws apply to me. That&#39;s not a defense - that&#39;s a request for evidence.</p>

<p>3.) I&#39;m not going to interpret laws or codes. If their codes and laws don&#39;t apply to me then I have no need or interest in interpreting them. If their codes and laws do apply to me then I will think onit. If they have facts proving that their codes and laws apply to me then I&#39;ll go ahead and think about interpretations; otherwise it&#39;s a waste of time.</p>

<p>4.) I&#39;ve spoken to lawyers, accountants, law students, paralegals and so on. They all tell me I&#39;m crazy, but I tested it out on a parking ticket (all legal controversies are structured in a manner that&#39;s basically the same) and I won. I&#39;m doing it again i a week or two. I&#39;m going to induce a more formal attack by smoking pot in public or something later on. I want a prosecutor. I want the full dog and pony show. I fought the law and I won. The next question is how to do it as effectively as possible in the shortest time possible.</p>

<p>And, yes, I&#39;ll be going pro se.</p>

<p>5.) The citizenship thing is irrelevant. If they want to call me a U.S. citizen they&#39;ll have to prove that I am a citizen. Which they can&#39;t do since they have no duty to protect.</p>

<p>6.) I&#39;m not interested in tax protest bullshit.</p>

<p>If they have proof that I owe them money then I&#39;ll give them money.</p>

<p>Until then I see no reason to give them anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I understand what you are getting at but what makes you think they will play fair? The US imprisons people wrongly every day for anything under the sun. What makes you think that the judicial system won&#39;t just squash you just to prove it can? You are putting a lot of faith in your interpretation of the law and that&#39;s fine but the law is upheld by humans. These are the same humans who enslaved, murdered, and beat one another since the dawn of human record keeping. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They will not play fair.</p>

<p>They will cheat. </p>

<p>They will lie.</p>

<p>That&#39;s their whole game.</p>

<p>The only defense, and I mean <em>the only defense</em>, I have is that I get to create a public record that anyone can look up for themselves. Expose their villainy and they become obvious villains. No one wants to play with a villain. So show them as the villains they are and fewer will want to play with them. Since I&#39;m using their own words against them the villains will want to minimize their exposure to public view. </p>

<p>The aim is to get them to withdraw before a trial manifests.</p>

<p>Look up the Bhumisparsha. Buddha was sitting under a tree and was tempted by every fear and terror. They all came at him. Rather than give in to fear he simply touched the ground. &quot;I am here.&quot; That is how I deal with them. They will hurl every unholy and horrible threat they can at me and I know it. But behind all of that is nothingness. All they have is the willingness to commit violence. If that is the source of their power then all I have to do is reject their threats as being meaningful. And suddenly they&#39;re common thugs.</p>

<p>Another way of looking at it is this way: even if they attack me, violate their own due process clauses and force an erroneous conviction I still win. I show them for the villains they are. And I create a public record of their treachery. And then everyone will know and fewer people will want to cooperate. It doesn&#39;t matter if they win or I win. I still win the point of exposing them for what they are.</p>

<p>And I&#39;d like to realy drive this point home:</p>

<p>Plaintiff bears the burden of proof. Not the defendant.</p>

<p>By calling them out I force them to prove their position. They&#39;re just people. The only difference between myself and them is that they&#39;re willing to use violence to support their position. Other than that they&#39;re just men. I do not bow to men.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t expect to be taken seriously when you say things like this.  40% of the budget goes towards &quot;defense&quot;, which is just more corporate imperialism.  Beyond that, you have corruption and grift which account for god knows how much.  Not only that, but you are essentially paying for and incentivizing people to make bad decisions in life through many social programs that result in only more dependency on the state.</p>

<p>I see.  Playing devil&#39;s advocate here, what about the following:</p>

<p>Your line of approach is that they have no evidence that you owe them money.  You don&#39;t think they can figure out some way to finagle around that argument?  Can&#39;t they say something like &quot;The state provides you with &#39;this, that, and the other&#39; service which requires communal/public financial support and cooperation from the plebeians to continue operating.  You <em>have</em> to pay taxes because you are using services the state provides that the public - which <em>you</em> are part of - uses.  It&#39;s not fair or legal for you to NOT pay taxes, yet use services (public roads, libraries, etc, etc) that exist <em>because</em> of taxes that everyone else pays.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1.) The line I&#39;m using is a purely Taoist line.</p>

<p>They&#39;re the energetic party and I am the water. If they come at me they expend energy. All court proceedings operate under this general concept: the attacking party must have reason to attack. Absent a reason to attack the attack must cease.</p>

<p>Offer no resistance other than to force them to adhere to their own rules.</p>

<p>All lines begin with halting all cooperation and all participation. The moment you stop communicating with them they become the acting party. You don&#39;t go to them. They come to you. Once they come to you this means you&#39;re in the position of power. You then have resting initiative. Like how in the game chess, if they position to attack you merely move to a more advantageous position in response to their move. Let them expend energy into a temporarily attacking pose; if your long game is better than their short game then you&#39;ve allowed them to set themselves up for a failure.</p>

<p>Let them attack first.</p>

<p>In legal proceedings the acting party has the burden of proof (this is why Bill Cooper failed when he tried to sue the IRS, by the by). Since the IRS has no evidence that their codes apply to anyone you let them hang themselves by merely calling out their lack of evidence. All due process errors stem from this request: &quot;where&#39;s the evidence?&quot;</p>

<p>If they fail to provide evidence (which must always be the case since they have none) you merely file a motion to dismiss based on their lack of evidence. You cannot be the one to make this assertion, however. You must induce this admission from them. So call them, with a witness and a full audio recording as well as a written recording, and ask them for their evidence. Use all of their deflections and non-responsiveness to show bad faith (due process error). Note that they say that tbey have no evidence. Use their own admissions against them.</p>

<p>Aikido.</p>

<p>Read Sun Tzu and I&#39;m actually mimicking him, but in a curt setting rather than on a battle field.</p>

<p>2.) &quot;Public services&quot; are not individually offered to me. I have no legally binding agreement with any municipal organization. If they have evidence of a legally binding agreement with a municipal organization then so be it, but absent any binding agreement this is mere rhetoric. It would be like me offering to cut you lawn, cutting your lawn without your approval and then demanding two hundred bucks for cutting your lawn on pain of violence. If you and I had no agreement then it doesn&#39;t matter if I cut your lawn. You don&#39;t owe me two hundred bucks.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that threats of violence are duress and always void any otherwise legally binding agreement. The very fact that they&#39;re threatening me with violence automatically voids what could be considered an agreement (not that there is any evidence of such an agreement).</p>

<p>This is why the Sun Tzu approach is effective. </p>

<p>You got to flow like water, my friend.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s a wonderful philosophy, but there seems to be an unsettlingly voluminous amount of evidence suggesting that the attacking party in this case is a covertly sociopathic one.  As such, their <em>reason</em> to attack may not necessarily be one tethered exclusively to either the rule of law or to the rules they set for the rest of the public to follow.  As a result, although it seems your argument is a valid one, I wonder what kind of shenanigans they may attempt (illegal or otherwise) if push comes to shove.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Even with what I said above, I fully agree with this line of reasoning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if your long game is better than their short game then you&#39;ve allowed them to set themselves up for a failure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Theoretically, this is 100% correct.  I guess, of course, the only problem with this is that they have billions of dollars worth of &quot;long game&quot;, and most of us plebs have, at most, a few short thousand dollars worth of it.  The game here isn&#39;t <em>all</em> about money, of course, and there are things that can be done that don&#39;t strictly involve financial expenditure, but the game of attrition is one that we plebs would have to be willing to REALLY commit to in order to fair well.</p>

<p>Read the rest of what you had to say, and can&#39;t upvote enough.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Beautifully-said.  Very good, intelligent rebuttal, sir.</p>

<p>Man, I can&#39;t give you <em>enough</em> encouragement.</p>

<p>That being said, I&#39;ll also impart the following information:</p>

<p>Are you familiar with the youtube channel <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/StormCloudsGathering">StormCloudsGathering</a>?  I would imagine you are, as many of the channel&#39;s videos have been linked in this very subreddit, and what seems like a lot of very relevant information is imparted regarding the nefarious state of affairs of TPTB that rule over this civilization.</p>

<p>Like I&#39;m sure many have, I&#39;ve wondered &quot;Who <em>is</em> that guy?&quot;  Who <em>is</em> the voice behind Storm Clouds Gathering?</p>

<p>Well, I just recently found <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ww5CM0jLBkg">this interview right here</a>.  I&#39;m listening to it now, and am just a touch over an hour into it.</p>

<p>I <em>very</em> much recommend you listen to it, as he starts talking about some of the very things that we discuss here (in a nebulous way, but still touches upon them).  I only recommend your listening to it just so you can get another perspective on another individual&#39;s experiences with tptb, and some of the reactions he&#39;s had as he works on &quot;pushing the envelope&quot; of the freedom that we should all have anyway.</p>

<p>I still champion and encourage what you&#39;re doing, and really DO wish more of us picked up the mantle with you, sir.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not opposed to joining you.</p>

<p>Namaste,</p>

I&#39;ve listened to one or two of his interviews and he&#39;s incredibly bright. To a large extent I agree with him, however the complexity of modern civilization as it exists seems incompatible with his ideas.</p>

<p>Then again, I&#39;m into anarchy and I&#39;m only a single step away from where he is. Not that I advocate smaller groups so much as I think all people should be allowed their own autonomy to decide with what they associate / participate. If they like large groups then they may join large groups. If they like small group then they may join small groups. The only issue for me is compulsory participation on pain of violence. I have no problems with Commies and Fascists so long as they don&#39;t force me into their bullshit. Let them have their petty kingdoms. Just leave me the hell alone.</p>

<p>Anyway, yeah, I&#39;m going to try and find a way to put these ideas out quickly.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to start writing them down tonight and organizing them. My old computer had a really cool faux anarchist propaganda piece that I edited last week. YouTube didn&#39;t like the music and so disallowed the upload. Too bad. Now I kinda want to do something like that again, but with this taxation thing in mind. Maybe I could make something fun to watch instead of boring to watch. Then again, maybe I&#39;ll just leave it as text for those who like to read.</p>

<p>Much to contemplate.</p>

<p>Well, don&#39;t make it <em>too</em> &quot;fun&quot; to watch.  Certainly don&#39;t choose style over substance - at least not with regard to important information like this.  I&#39;d prefer dry truth and information to colorful fluff any day of the week.</p>

<p>Also maybe just  read the text aloud for those that <em>don&#39;t</em> like to read.  Then they could just listen to what is said.</p>

<p>Things to consider...</p>

<p>Godspeed.</p>

<p>Well just make sure the info <em>really</em> makes sense to YOU.  If you can explain it in such a manner that you hear it and you go &quot;Yeah.  Yeah I get that.&quot; then I&#39;d imagine that might not be a bad litmus test for whether it might be passable or not to others as well.</p>

<p>I mean I&#39;m sure there will be some that won&#39;t like it, but hell...that&#39;ll be the case with ANY version of almost <em>anything</em> that ever gets publicly put out.  That&#39;s just the way things go.  I say just make an honest presentation that YOU feel good about, and those that are meant to &quot;get it&quot; will.</p>

<p>Honestly, I don&#39;t think you have too great a deal to worry about regarding the possibility of it reading like Kant.  And I don&#39;t say that because I don&#39;t think you&#39;re intelligent.  I say that because if you have at least some minimal graphic and audio representation along with whatever you talk about, it should be decent enough to not be &quot;absolutely unbearable&quot;.</p>

<p>I mean hell.  Think of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7dFvrYVRpg">Bill Still&#39;s work</a>.  I&#39;d say his stuff could be pretty damn dry here and there...and his video is LOOONG!  However, his data is absolutely <em>classic</em> and super well-respected nonetheless.</p>

<p>That entire paragraph boils down to : &quot;the code applies because the code says so.&quot; That&#39;s not extra-judicial. Evidence means facts presentable to the senses. Opinions written down by the court are not evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1.) I&#39;m only concerned with facts that can be entered into evidence. If prosecution makes arguments outside of the facts in evidence this counts as misconduct; possibly grounds for a mistrial. Legal citations cannot be entered into evidence. They can be used to interpret facts, but they are not extra-judicial facts [evidence].</p>

<p>All the U.S. Constitution talk in the world is irrelevant if it doesn&#39;t apply to me.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the factual connection?</p>

<p>2.) The W-2 form I filed out was between myself and my employer. I have no direct communication with the IRS. If my employer has communication with the IRS then that&#39;s their business not mine. I would add that the only reason my employer is having communication with the IRS is because of threats. If you do not communicate with the IRS they will make threats about closing you down or taking your business. Duress.</p>

<p>3.) Testimony of what? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not being hostile, mind you. It took me a year to get to this level of understanding. If I come off as haughty or clipped it&#39;s only because I&#39;ve been through these lines many times over with lawyers, paralegals and trolls. No lawyer has ever come back at me with relevant evidence. Only logical fallicies, unbacked assertions and legal citations. I know that my logic is sound and sometimes it comes off as &quot;a bit much&quot; to the uninitiated.</p>

<p>Without a doubt.</p>

<p>There will be a cost associated with taking that stand, but it won&#39;t be the end of the world.</p>

<p>In addition, if more people took such a stand, the policy would have to change. The last numbers I saw pegged IRS actions at 1200 a year or so. That is not many.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not a joke and it is not for the feint of heart. I have lost some sleep over this because I know very well that if the IRS levels its evil gaze on me I will be going up against one of the most corrupt and pitiless groups of people on the planet. They will not hesitate to destroy anyone and everyone if allowed to do so.</p>

<p>I am doing this on principle alone.</p>

<p>All of that said, once you understand that all legal battles are 1v1 fights it becomes clear. There are multiple stages to the fight (choosing the battleground, the weapons and the fighters). Then there is the fight itself. And then you can dispute the fairness of the fight if you don&#39;t like the call. The first thing to know is that whoever is the party initiating the fight has to prove their case. Plaintiff always bears the burden of proof. They thrust and I parry. I never thrust and I never take a hit (allow a baseless assertion to go un-objected).</p>

<p>In court you&#39;re basically on the losing end. The judge is supposed to act as a referee in this fight, however, the judge used to be a fighter (prosecutor). The ref will always give his fellow fighter a free pass. All you can realy do is pit the judge against the prosecutor and force the prosecutor to acknowledge he has no case and force the judge to recognize that the prosecutor has no case. If you&#39;re deft you just get them to withdraw their attack before it ever gets to trial. In fact the whole game is in pre-trial. Not trial. Sort of like how Sun Tzu said that the master wins without fighting. The best victory is when they merely withdraw without a fight (trial). </p>

<p>The way you do this is by inducing due process errors. Set up enough of these and you have a laundry list that can tie them up for ages with motions and writs. Make it as hard as possible for them to secure anything without violating due process (which is easy once you understand that they have no evidence that their codes and laws apply to you or anyone). All of the due process violations begin with calling them out on their lack of evidence of jurisdiction. After that they&#39;ll offer a cascading series of deflections and lies to cover for their lack of evidence. You don&#39;t fight them. You just smile, nod and ask them for their evidence. If they proceed absent evidence then they&#39;re making an arbitrary determination. If they say they have evidence, but fail to prove their evidence then they&#39;re with-holding evidence (misconduct). If the judge allows this then he&#39;s allowing misconduct which is, itself, misconduct and grounds for vacating the judge. </p>

<p>There are scores of permutations and I&#39;m still learning them in anticipation of the possibility that I am forced into the disquieting position of having to deflect their attacks. At which time Sun Tzu&#39;s wisdom will be one of two books ready-at-hand.</p>

<p>I would say three things:</p>

<p>1.) The real battle is not at trial - it&#39;s pre-trial.</p>

<p>2.) Motions are the power-moves. Oral statements are just how to get the necessary admissions to file a motion. What&#39;s the motion? A motion to dismiss for lack of evidence. From whom do you need this admission? Prosecution. The first thing you do is request discovery. Then you call the prosecutor - while recording audio and with a witness - ask for the evidence they rely on to support the legal conclusion that their codes and laws apply to you. After they throw sand in your eye ask if their refusal to answer is an indication that they have no such evidence. If they refuse to respond then you can still file a motion to dismiss indicating that they failed to provide discovery and have not presented evidence of jurisdiction. Get it in writing. Motions are how you get it in writing.</p>

<p>3.) Marc Stevens is a good primer. He&#39;s silly, disorganized and a bit of a zealot, however I&#39;ve used his method successfully. The method: just get them to back their assertions with facts. If they fail to provide evidence then file a motion to dismiss for lack of evidence <em>using their own admissions</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His &quot;model&quot; is not well described by him. He knows what to do, but doesn&#39;t know how to convey it. It&#39;s kind of like a chess master who knows about openings and knows why certain openings work, but hasn&#39;t yet organized his thoughts so that he can explain it to others.</p>

<p>I have his second book and it&#39;s painful to read. I know exactly where he&#39;s going with pretty much every sentence, however he&#39;s trying to both preach to the choir and give relevant information at the same time. Which makes it very hard to read. I&#39;ve dabbled in philosophy and analysis so I know how to read something convoluted. Others without my background will find his text to be little more than prattlings. Frankly I don&#39;t recommend his book to anyone other than the most die-hard anarchists.</p>

<p>I&#39;m currently toying with the idea of taking his concepts and formulating them into something digestible to the general audience. I think people should be able to defend themselves against bureaucrats and government officials. The only reason it took me so long to finally halt participation with tribute [Federal Income Tax] is because I didn&#39;t know of any good models. I know damned well that I&#39;m not the only one like me. I think it would be good to share this information with those willing to actually stand up for what is good and decent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The methodology is nothing more than calling them out on their lack of evidence. Literally everything follows from that basic question. In order for them to proceed they must force due process violations. There are a multitude of ways to deal with this only a few of which I know. I&#39;m still in the learning process myself. Being an autodidact is a double edged sword; you learn exactly what you want, but the cost is a lot of lateral drift. </p>

<p>My point is that there is no specific step-by-step approach because you&#39;re going to be dealing with a different bureaucrat every time. Like in chess: you must learn openings in general and understand principles in order to play at tournament level. Fortunately most bureaucrats are club players and so anyone with a greater understanding can bet them. They rely on intimidation - not logic. The moment you shift to logic you&#39;re already playing above their level.</p>

<p>But, yes, an understanding of what cases are and how they work would be useful.</p>

<p>As soon as I figure out the formal difference between a complaint and a case I&#39;ll be getting to work on a quite pamphlet on the subject so that people can defend themselves slightly easier in court. Hopefully I&#39;ll understand this within the week.</p>

<p>I went to the Tea Parties and the Occupy. Nothing. I went to rallies and protests. Nothing. I voted. Nothing. I briefly contemplated some kind of formal violent rebellion, but that seemed like an even worse path. And then, back in late 2010 I accidentally found myself researching psychopathy. Ever since then my model for dealing with government is like dealing with a cult headed by a psychopath. The only option is to avoid all contact and do everything you can you with-hold participation and cooperation. One person starts off a chain reaction. I&#39;m not the first person, so I&#39;m not that special. But I do count myself as one of those who does his part.</p>

<p>I thank you for the tip of the hat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My reflexive retort would be, &quot;Luck is for the ill-prepared&quot; - however I understand what you mean. There actually is an element of luck in that you don&#39;t know what kind of bureaucrat will attack you. It&#39;s possible you get a proto-psychopath rather than a full-blown-from-birth psychopath. If you only get a proto-psychopath then there&#39;s the possibility of getting the attack muted or withdrawn immediately. In this sense I accept your blessing.</p>

<p>Violence is the stock and trade of government.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t take unlicensed competition lightly, and they are far more prepared for that kind of battle than anyone else is.</p>

<p>Violence also strengthens an otherwise weak claim to legitimacy. Acts of violence are generally common law crimes that create victims who are justified in calling on the power of government for redress.</p>

<p>Anyone who encourages violence is working for the government, with or without the intention of doing so.</p>

<p>There&#39;s the outside chance that some idiot might misinterpret my paperwork as evidence of submission to their codes. Obviously this is not the case and I can go through it, but it&#39;s a lot cleaner if you&#39;re self-employed. Ideally I should find a way to start my own business.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been there man, I&#39;m telling you from experience its best to just acknowledge that its wrong and educate others. If you try to put your foot down on income tax, you are still paying sales tax, you are still paying tax on every single gallon of gas you buy, property tax, cigarette and alcohol tax, firearm and ammunition tax, do you have a drivers license? that was a tax. renewed the tags on your car? also a tax. Got a speeding ticket or busted for pot? Other forms of taxation. There are many other taxes, all of which we are forced to pay via threat of force from the government and their goons but theres no way to win through force. The best thing to do is keep educating yourself, and educate others. I recommend checking out <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/anarcho_capitalism">r/anarcho_capitalism</a>, as people like Spooner are often discussed, as well as the topic of taxation and government coercion, i think you would appreciate it, possibly more than this sub.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no evidence of that. Since the height of their power in the 19th century, there has been the rise of corporate banking, income tax, inheritance tax, World War I, the Great Depression, World War II and the Nazi confiscation of all their property in continental Europe (only some of which they got back after the war).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Usury has always been a problem, in all ages and empires. A small example from history:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When William the Conqueror arrived in England in 1066, he encouraged Jewish merchants and artisans from northern France to move to England. The Jews came mostly from France with some from Germany, Italy and Spain, seeking prosperity and a haven from anti-Semitism. Serving as special representatives of the king, these Jews worked as moneylenders and coin dealers. Over the course of a generation, Jews established communities in London, York, Bristol, Canterbury and other major cities. They generally lived in segregated areas by themselves. However, until 1177 only one Jewish cemetery was allowed to be established in London.</p>

<p>During the Middle Ages, usury, or lending money for interest, was considered a sin by the Catholic Church. Therefore, Christians were forbidden to work as moneylenders and Jews were called to that occupation and were able to set high interest rates. They played a vital role in maintaining the British treasury and, for a time, the Crown watched over the Jewish financiers and their property, though they also taxed them onerously. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can someone explain this part to me:</p>

<p>When these great lenders of blood-money, like the Rothschilds, have loaned vast sums in this way, for purposes of murder, to an emperor or a king, <strong><em>they sell out the bonds taken by them</em></strong>, in small amounts, to anybody, and everybody, who are disposed to buy them at satisfactory prices, to hold as investments. They (the Rothschilds) thus soon get back their money, with great profits.</p>

<p>That part in bold isn&#39;t very clear to me.</p>

<p>Does it mean they force the heads of state to sell bonds to the market to be able to pay back the interest for the massive loans?</p>

<p>What makes you think that? I&#39;ve never seen any reliable they have ever owned a significant number of shares of any of the member banks of the Federal Reserve. If they do, it&#39;s through several layers of institutional holdings, the trading of which is private, so there&#39;s no way to know whether they have divested themselves of shares or not.</p>

<p>Can you explain where Chart 1 comes from and what it means?</p>

<p>It&#39;s implied on the web page that it comes from <em>Federal Reserve Directors: A Study of Corporate and Banking Influence</em>, published in 1976.</p>

<p>Well, here is that publication: <a href="https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/docs/historical/house/197608hr_frdirectors.pdf">https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/docs/historical/house/197608hr_frdirectors.pdf</a></p>

<p>That chart is not from it.</p>

<p>If you look closely at the chart, it doesn&#39;t even make sense. There are businesses, people, and other things all mixed up. There&#39;s no explanation of what the lines mean.</p>

<p>Look at the very top of the chart: &quot;N.M. Rothschild , London - Bank of England&quot;. What? N.M. Rothschild is a large private investment bank. The Bank of England, on the other hand, is part of the British government. It has been since 1946.</p>

<p>Some of the lines appear to mean familial relationships, others directorships, maybe. Still others are mysterious. There are banks on there from different decades--&quot;National Bank of Commerce N.Y.&quot; stopped being called that in the 1920s and shareholders who died as long ago as 1920.</p>

<p>Can you explain the chart?</p>

<p>By the way, even if someone convinces all the big banks in New York to collude in their votes for control of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, they could only elect 2 of the 9 directors of the Bank. And that&#39;s only of 1 of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks. And most of the power of the Federal Reserve System is in the Board of Governors, who are appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate.</p>

<p>So, even if some foreign entity controlled <em>all</em> of the big banks in New York (which isn&#39;t true), that still wouldn&#39;t let them control the Federal Reserve System.</p>

<p>The Fed is a public utility owned by private interests. American currency is private scrip issued by private interests.</p>

<p>In 1928, the US Supreme Court ruled:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instrumentalities like the national banks or the federal reserve banks, in which there are private interests, are not departments of the government. They are private corporations in which the government has an interest.</p>

<ul>
<li>Yes it&#39;s from the 90&#39;s</li>
<li>No it&#39;s not HD</li>
<li>Yes it&#39;s long (3.5 hours)</li>
<li>No, it&#39;s not a waste of time</li>
<li>Yes, you&#39;ll want to take the pen and shove it up his backside by the time it&#39;s over</li>
</ul>

<p>...if you, or nearly anyone, can watch it without learning anything and uttering the words WTF I would be extremely shocked.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I foresee the government arguing (with success) that the obligation (to pay income tax) does not need to be explicitly stated or created by any Federal statute; and that the IRS, as an administrative agency created by Congress, is permitted through its code and rulings to take on quasi legislative and Judicial functions. They will then state that the basis for the obligation is grounded in the USC 16th Amendment which gives the government the power to tax, plus IRC Sec. 61 which defines gross income for tax purposes, and IRS Rev. Rul. 2007-19, which states, among the obligation to pay income taxes on income derived from providing services in exchange for pay, the penalties for not doing so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That entire paragraph boils down to : &quot;the code applies because the code says so.&quot; That&#39;s not extra-judicial. Evidence means facts presentable to the senses. Opinions written down by the court are not evidence.</p>

<p>Seen another way, Stare Decisis is not Rez Judicata.</p>

<p>Laws are legal opinions enforced by groups willing to kill for those opinions.</p>

<p>The fact that the opinion was written down doesn&#39;t make it any less an opinion.</p>

<p>Ask a lawyer and they&#39;ll tell you the exact same thing.</p>

<p>I know this because I&#39;ve asked lawyers.</p>
