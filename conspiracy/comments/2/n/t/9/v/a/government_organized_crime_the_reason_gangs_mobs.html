<p>You think they&#39;rd be hells angels rolling around if they didn&#39;t want them to be? You know how much drugs the Angels and the Cartels move? You know how much of thier black budget gets paid by that?</p>

<p>Governments needs to allow black markets. Large, organized criminal gangs can be used much like a &#39;civilian&#39; spy agency that the government can use plausible deniablility when the &#39;boys&#39; get caught doing shit.</p>

<p>Say, assassination for example. You could have one of your black ops spies do it, or you could pay off a hells angel $50k for the hit, and it&#39;ll look like a robbery gone bad. Ooops.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, more printing of money means less purchasing power of each individual unit of that currency, but there are many other variables in the situation. We (US) have used that money to build the largest military the world has ever seen and we have established bases around the world in nearly every country.</p>

<p>However, if you understand that the quantitative easing (QE) programs are just money printing schemes, the formation of the BRICS bank seems to make much more sense in context. Many countries are tired of holding their assets in USD and there is a slow, politically timed movement away from the dollar because of exact reasons you stated.</p>

<p>The US is printing money like crazy, which is why it is obvious to anyone who&#39;s aware that the US is in it&#39;s death throes. Normally you would want to avoid monetizing debt, but that is literally standard operating procedure for the Fed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm. What other variables are at play here? Just curious what you have to say. Also, Could you provide some sources linking the printing of money? No blogs, please. </p>

<p>Quantitative easing is not devaluing the currency by printing more money, but buying bonds from private financial institutions. this increases the money supply, but this money supply is from what is already on the market, not created out of thin air. </p>

<p>I&#39;m quite confused by your &quot;money printing schemes&quot;; please explain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, those bonds that are bought by the Fed are debt issued by the treasury so the money issued by the Fed through the QE programs is not what is already on the market. </p>

<p>Although the Fed will never officially refer to quantitative easing as &quot;money printing&quot;, that&#39;s exactly what it is. Also, the current zero interest rate policy artificially inflates liquidity and contributes to a misallocation of capital. I&#39;ll post some links later, I&#39;m at work right now on mobile.</p>
