        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello folks,</p>

<p>Thank you for your nominations and voting over the past few days to assist us in determining our new moderators. We&#39;re happy to announce that we have called an end to the vote, which has resulted in the addition of three new mods.</p>

<p>Please note that vote totals from the nomination thread shift upon each reload of the page (and that only users with at least one mod vouch were included in vote tallying-this excluded <a href="/u/not_jtrig">/u/not_jtrig</a>, who did not have any mod vouches. <a href="/u/sovereignman">/u/sovereignman</a> was also excluded as he, sadly, turned down his nomination.) As such, the following results were the most stable that the mod team was able to determine at the close of voting. We will now take <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2nhd2n/happy_thanksgiving_everyone_we_need_more_mods/">the thread</a> out of contest mode such that users can see the voting results for themselves (although, please note, that vote totals may continue to fluctuate as a result of voting continuing to occur subsequent to this announcement).  </p>

<p>Our three new mods are;</p>

<p><strong><a href="/u/orangutan">/u/orangutan</a></strong> with <a href="https://i.imgur.com/UZB2X6w.png">20 points</a></p>

<p><strong><a href="/u/Ambiguously_Ironic">/u/Ambiguously_Ironic</a></strong> with <a href="https://i.imgur.com/1Q6BJa3.png">11 points</a></p>

<p><strong><a href="/u/creq">/u/creq</a></strong> with <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vUvjzeW.png">11 points</a></p>

<p>The mod team is pleased to welcome these new additions, which will hopefully allow us to more promptly respond to modmails and arrange future AMA&#39;s; we also feel that they will all be able to successfully uphold the free flow of information as the core maxim of their modship. As always, other mods will keep an eye on the modlog and review the actions of the new mods over the first few months. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Now to more unfortunate news regarding the conspiracy to impersonate Mr. Gage during his AMA;</p>

<p>We were approached by a user who directed us to an ama in <a href="/r/911truth">/r/911truth</a> by the founder of Pilots for 9/11 truth, Rob Balsamo. Mr. Balsamo <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/911truth/comments/2nbg4b/i_am_the_founder_of_pilots_for_911_truth_ama/cmd2hpc">was asked about certain statements made during the supposed AMA by Richard Gage, and informed the users of that subreddit that he had spoken to Richard Gage, who declined ever having participated in an AMA on reddit</a>  </p>

<p>Upon hearing this information; the moderators of this subreddit immediately began to look into the situation. </p>

<p>The back story is thus;</p>

<p>One of our moderators spent a few weeks setting up <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2k7xng/hi_im_richard_gage_founder_of_architects/">an ama</a> with Richard Gage (Head of AE911truth), via user <a href="/u/ae911truth">/u/ae911truth</a>  (now deleted) who was, for months, misrepresenting himself as a representative of the organization.</p>

<p>The AMA was conducted under the username <a href="/u/Richard_Gage">/u/Richard_Gage</a> . Both accounts were deleted simultaneously when other users began to unravel the conspiracy after the statements by Rob Balsamo.</p>

<p>The user <a href="/u/ae911truth">/u/ae911truth</a> went so far as to provide members of our mod team with fake verification tweets and other email documentation; and while we feel terrible about falling victim to this impersonator, it is not our main concern.</p>

<p>Whoever was behind these two accounts engaged in behavior that was clearly designed not simply to mislead this subreddit (nearly six months ago they attempted to setup an ama on <a href="/r/911truth">/r/911truth</a>), but rather to attack and slander the reputation of Mr. Gage.</p>

<p>This is very disconcerting  and the lengths to which <a href="/u/ae911truth">/u/ae911truth</a> went to provide false verification has also forced us to raise our standards for what will be considered acceptable proof for AMA&#39;s in the future; which only complicates further the process of setting up these interviews for the community.</p>

<p>We want to be clear that this was not a short con; the user had been impersonating the organization for months and this is something we are taking quite seriously; which is to say, this reaches beyond normal reddit meta drama and directly impacts the reputation of an actual person.</p>

<p>We have held off commenting formally on this matter until the admins were given an opportunity to look into the situation; unfortunately they are not able to divulge any information surrounding this conspiracy.  </p>

<p>We have reached out to Mr. Gage and expressed our deepest sympathies for falling victim to this conspiracy. We also apologize profusely to you, the users, for this slanderous impersonation. Although we have just begun recruiting AMA&#39;s, we have now substantially raised the standards of proof for future interviews to prevent any further forgeries. </p>

<p>We extend a thank you to Mr. Balsamo for uncovering this conspiracy, and also to <a href="/u/NAM007">/u/NAM007</a> who alerted us to the statements by Mr. Balsamo.</p>

It&#39;s really amazing to what degree of effort the kids at <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> are willing to go to in their desperate attempts to make themselves feel good about themselves on the internet.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiratards">/r/conspiratards</a> say -</p>

<p><em>conspiracy subject matter</em>: gee that stuff would make me feel less powerful/less intelligent/less in control of my own life if it were true, so I better avoid and ridicule it to make sure I don&#39;t have to feel that way</p>

<p><em>conspiracy theorist</em>: I know! I&#39;ll just attack the people conveying and discussing the information! That way I can make myself feel better without ever addressing the actual issues! Hehehehe! </p>

<p>They really do exactly what they pretend conspiracy theorists are doing - they want desperately to feel intellectually superior, though they really aren&#39;t or are not willing to put the time in to BE intellectually superior -so they latch onto the official social narrative which is crafted precisely to give them the illusion of control over their lives/minds/intelligence - while trying desperately to make fun of and put down anyone who would suggest anything other than that which makes them feel good &amp; special(that being the official social narrative of world events that they believe in and use as a context by which to live by and ground their minds in while they go through the government-run life systems of high school/college/public jobs/etc).</p>

<p>No offense, but to some of us it is.  Is there a fox in the henhouse?  I would like to see these emails and tweets if at all possible.  As a member of the conspiracy community, I find it hard to believe that the mod team excepts us to trust based on concealed evidence.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your comment almost mirrors mine last night. There just may be a fox in the henhouse. And I thought the vote for mods should be suspended until we reinforce the foundations of this sub. Given the last threads for voting mods it seemed unusual this particular one was set to contest mode. I understand vote brigading and such. But sensor ing the vote is unusual for this sub on many levels. Perhaps it was a way to catch a fox or two? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The contest mode for mod nominations was put in place during voting solely as a mechanism to prevent vote brigading; we were concerned that outside groups from within the reddit meta, if given access to the numbers during the voting, may have been incentivized to coordinate offsite on certain irc networks in order to alter the nominations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one thing I couldn&#39;t get by was the mod vouch.  I mean... wtf was that all about?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The two most up voted nominations will become the new mods with one small exception. Nominations must also have at least one existing mod vouch for them, this is to avoid any fuckery that may be afoot from certain groups that like to organize voting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please note that vote totals from the nomination thread shift upon each reload of the page (and that only users with at least one mod vouch were included in vote tallying-this excluded <a href="/u/not_jtrig">/u/not_jtrig</a>, who did not have any mod vouches.</p>

<p>Seriously, what criteria qualified a &#39;vouch&#39; from a mod?  Knowing the person?  Liking the person?  Agreeing with the person?</p>

<p>Concealed evidence, concealed voting, mod &#39;vouches&#39;.  This shit is far from the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> I use to know.  What&#39;s going on here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, but we&#39;ve been talking for months about getting <a href="/u/Orangutan">/u/Orangutan</a> on board. *He provides great content and even helped set up a (legitimate) AMA that&#39;s coming up soon. I even nominated *him for mod ages ago before I became one. </p>

<p>I was definitely pleased when *him won outright. I know only a little about creq, but from what I know I believe it was a good choice. They wouldn&#39;t have been my pick, but again, creq&#39;s knowledge of reddit will be really useful. </p>

<p>And Ambiguously has been one of my favorite folks here for a while now, so I was also really pleased with that.</p>

<p>You never know what&#39;s going to happen with these mod nomination threads, and we always go into with a certain level of uneasy anticipation. The only slightly unexpected thing was not_jtrig getting high votes. I think we made the right call and vetoed that user (they never comment or participate in the sub).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As much as I like <a href="/u/creq">/u/creq</a> &amp; <a href="/u/ambiguously_ironic">/u/ambiguously_ironic</a> I believe it is a mistake to add anyone as a moderator with anything less than 5 years on reddit with the one account. 
As we&#39;ve seen with that debacle with the Richard gage AMA, those who have bad intentions for this sub are quite prepared to put in the hard yards to get in deep into The sub. If they&#39;re prepared to do months worth of work to achieve a false AMA, it&#39;s not a huge stretch of the imagination to say that they&#39;re prepared to do a year or so. 
This decision you are making today is a rash one, please consider a 5 year minimum. 
I am not meaning to offend anybody, but if I do, My apologies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% agree with you on that, I don&#39;t really know what the solution is especially when, for instance, our head mod hasn&#39;t made an appearance in months (as far as I&#39;m aware).

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2nhd2n/happy_thanksgiving_everyone_we_need_more_mods/">The two most up voted nominations will become the new mods with one small exception. Nominations must also have at least one existing mod vouch for them, this is to avoid any fuckery that may be afoot from certain groups that like to organize voting.</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem I see with that is that it still doesn&#39;t stop another sub from gaming the thing. The mod vouch really should have been called a mod vito to allow them to deny someone who has a questionable history from getting the position.</p>

<p>My other concern is with shadowbanned accounts. If we went by karma/history it makes it tough for people who have been shadowbanned in the past.</p>

<p>I guess it should probably be a combination of everything we&#39;ve mentioned, user votes, history/longevity/karma, and reputation in the community.</p>

<p>Where did the idea of a mod &#39;vouch&#39; come from?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This idea originated with the same line of reasoning behind the contest mode; with the amount of groups who exist both on and offsite with the sole purpose of attacking and subverting this sub, we felt it necessary to put in a place mechanisms which would prevent any manipulation of the voting or selection process. Both other subreddits and off site IRC channels have more than enough active online users to artificially manipulate a mod vote thread, and we felt this was a distinct possibility. </p>

<p>We had originally planned to go with a minimum karma requirement (either link or comment karma from within the sub); but concluded that a mod vouch system would be a bit easier to implement. Again, the idea behind both the vouch and the contest mode was to prevent the sub from being infiltrated by organized off site voting.  </p>

<p>I understand your desire to secure <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> from infiltrators, but I would like more specific answers.  Who was the first to suggest a vouch system, was it a unanimous decision (was there a vote) and what qualifies a &#39;vouch&#39;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I came up with the vouch system.</p>

<p>There is always concern that &#39;some group&#39; will try to infiltrate the mod team and use that position to vandalize the community or otherwise hurt it.</p>

<p>I honestly didn&#39;t think it would come into play, it was there in case some obvious fuckery was afoot and someone like bipolarbear0 got themselves voted into a mod position.</p>

<p>This user <a href="/u/not_jtrig">/u/not_jtrig</a> has literally never made a comment in our sub, or anywhere on reddit that I can see.  Who are they? What do they represent?  Anyone can post conspiracy related articles for months on end and earn sweet karma.  But who is this person? How did they get so many votes without ever having commented on anything anywhere?</p>

<p>The other proposed requirement that we didn&#39;t end up going with was a karma requirement.  Which would simply disqualify young accounts or frequently brigaded users.</p>

<p>I vouched for a lot of people, there was no secret requirement to earn a vouch from a mod.  Any mod could vouch for anyone for any reason.  And it seems to have worked out just fine.</p>

<p>What injustice do you perceive because of this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that is demonstrably untrue.</p>

<p>The community was asked to both nominate and vote on new mods, who became the new mods.  Right there are your standards.  The mod vouch insures that we don&#39;t invite in unwanted outsiders who like to organize voting.  </p>

<p>Not_jtrig didn&#39;t receive a mod vouch because they have literally never commented here.  All they do is post articles, which is fine, just not for a mod.  A mod is required to interact with the community and we had no basis with which to gauge how this user interacts with people.</p>

<p>Claiming the system worked is a leap in logic.  The system concluded and functioned, but did act as a true vote without outside/inside influence?  I don&#39;t know.  You hid the vote total during the vote, and imposed flimsy, opinionated standards.</p>

<p>After the recent debacle, how can you expect me to believe the vote was genuine?</p>

<p>THIS is the problem when you try to play gatekeeper.  Trust, out the window.  Even if your intentions were good.</p>

<p>No.  It&#39;s not the same thing.  Your vouch is influencing the vote, even if we can&#39;t see it.  Not only does it limit the debate to the chosen few, one mod is not a majority veto.</p>

<p>That&#39;s kind of the point.  We have a lot of inactive mods who are in very different time zones and we can&#39;t expect everyone to be present for a veto vote.  So we do it this other way around.   a vouch system, it works better with what we have here.</p>

<p>The system worked, it didn&#39;t fail.  You&#39;re unhappy with it, for that I&#39;m sorry but we can&#39;t please everyone all the time.  To even attempt to do so is an exercise madness.</p>

<p>What else can I explain? Why did we hide the votes?  Because when vote manipulators can&#39;t see the status of the vote they either don&#39;t do enough to successfully manipulate the outcome, or they do way too much and make it painfully obvious.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why we hid the vote, to give us the advantage in detecting anything strange.</p>

<p>Expect for the fact that anyone watching the sub can just influence the vote by brigading the vouched for people.  Don&#39;t you see that?  How does hiding the vote stop this?  It just makes it so the rest of us can&#39;t see it.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re perfectly fine with concealment and gatekeepers?  Odd for a conspiracy mod.</p>

<p>I had nothing to do with this AMA other than policing it for behavior standards.  This other mod would be able to answer those questions for you better.  I simply don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Other than the lack of clamoring, it seemed generally respectful and successful to me. Perhaps the timing of this AMA fiasco coming out soured your perspective. The mods have been discussing adding new members to the team for months now, the timing was just unfortunate.</p>

<p>Did this particular mod simply <strong><em>tell</em></strong> the other mods that he got that stuff, or was it shared and if so, what was provided?

<p>That&#39;s not the sense that I have. </p>

<p>According to him he&#39;s been researching 9/11 for over a decade but is very disappointed and is not a fan of Richard Gage or his organization and is also very disappointed with the 9/11 truth movement in general. </p>

<p>Although I don&#39;t think he was neccessarily in league with the one who perpetrated this hoax, that individual is also someone who&#39;s been following the 9/11 truth movement very closely from every angle, for years, and who is rather anti-truther, anti-Richard Gage. </p>

<p>This predisposed bias on the part of <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> is in and of itself sufficient grounds to call for his resignation as a mod. </p>

<p>He offered to resign, from what he told me, and I&#39;m flabbergasted that the other mods didn&#39;t accept his resignation.</p>

<p>How can you be a 9/11 researcher and not support our movement as the movement of the truth or Richard Gage and A&amp;E for 9/11 Turth as part of the leading edge of that spearhead? </p>

<p>It&#39;s INCONGRUENT, imho. </p>

<p>that Richard was indeed answering those questions &#39;correctly.&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I definitely made a mistake in that comment defending the AMA (which I&#39;ve completely retracted), I never said he was answering them <em>correctly</em>. </p>

<p>I was simply pointing out that your quibble with that particular answer seems to concern semantics. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>he claims we can compare a model of WTC7 with NIST&#39;s hidden model. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s where we disagree. Again, this isn&#39;t about me defending the imposter, but they <em>didn&#39;t</em> compare the WTC7 collapse with the NIST model. The statement seemed to be hypothetical, as I explained in the comment you linked.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You obviously don&#39;t know much about the 9.11.01 conspiracy if you allow fake Richard&#39;s definitions to stand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My error in judgement largely stemmed from knowing <em>too much</em> about the 911 conspiracy. </p>

<p>I disagree with the real Richard Gage. I think he&#39;s fulfilled a very important role in this debate, but he can only take us so far. I believe the mainstream 9/11 truth movement has been led astray. Although I don&#39;t believe Gage is responsible for this, I believe he has the power to get 9/11 truth out of its slump, and I don&#39;t think he&#39;s willing to do so.</p>

<p>Therefore, I went into the AMA <em>expecting</em> to be disappointed by the answers, and I was. </p>

<p>He even ignored the best question in the entire thread, and I publicly expressed my deep disappointment about that.</p>

<p>TBH, I happen to believe that the <em>real</em> Gage would&#39;ve been unable to <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2k7xng/hi_im_richard_gage_founder_of_architects/cliqpmh">address these questions</a> as well. The real Gage probably would&#39;ve ignored it or dismissed it, and I&#39;m basing this on what I know of A&amp;E for 911 truth and their previous stance on (brilliant) questions like this.</p>

<p>Again, I should never have defended the AMA in that one statement, but I <em>certainly</em> wasn&#39;t trying to convince people he was <em>right</em>. I very conspicuously expressed my profound disappointment elsewhere in that same thread.</p>

<p>I can understand why you&#39;re out for blood, but I have only so much left to give...</p>

<p>That&#39;s your problem with this situation. Once again, this isn&#39;t about you and me. You don&#39;t grasp the catastrophic failure you&#39;ve single handedly dealt to the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> community at large.</p>

<p>At this point I believe you are the enemy. You&#39;ve never pushed 911 that hard to begin with. Now you&#39;ve been caught red handed and no mods seem to &#39;care&#39; in the way that moderators should, plus the peanut gallery has virtually no say, except to stick up for your contributions.</p>

<p>This is a virtual reality set up much like the Bush administration. Gotta promote from within.</p>

<p>I noticed a new mod was all over that fake Richard Gage AMA. I noticed they were answering for fake Richard on roughly 20% of the questions. Those were the ones Richard &#39;sat out&#39; on. </p>

<p>Now, I know this mod knows 911 truth and 911 debunking backwards and forwards. I just don&#39;t know how it ties in to their new modship and the disastrous AMA. </p>

<p>The connections are there. </p>

<p>Orangutan should have called out fake Richard. ANY 911 TRUTH ADVOCATE COULD SEE THAT WAS A FAKE AMA!!!!!!</p>

<p>Why were the dissenting voices not heard? I mean, if namm and I are the only truth seekers who paid attention, what does that say about your modship? Or what does this say about the honeypot of an AMA that caught 2 people paying attention. 2 people, excluding every single mod, who weren&#39;t acting like sheep</p>

<p>E: Will the real Richard Gage ever come here for am AMA? NO. Not with you on the mod squad.</p>

<p>I have worked with Richard personally and that is a highly disrespectful assumption.  He would gladly and easily be able to counter those arguments. To label that wall-of-text as brilliant is hilarious considering it stems from ridiculous &quot;Judy Wood&quot; theories. What&#39;s your problem with AE911Truth? They are probably the most respected &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; in the game. Appearances at AIA conventions, 9/11 museum, C-SPAN, Fox, PBS, tours worldwide, millions of views online, full documentaries, confronting congressional staffers, funding legislative action for a new investigation, setting up billboards worldwide etc they have done more than any of us key board warriors combined. They have been doing real work for almost a decade. </p>

<p>This is why we brought this situation to the attention of the admins; as we very much believed that the user operating the <a href="/u/ae911truth">/u/ae911truth</a> and the <a href="/u/Richard_gage">/u/Richard_gage</a> account is a user who exists on the site (most likely within the reddit meta) under alternate user names. </p>

<p>The mod who was responsible for coordinating the AMA will certainly elaborate on what proof they were given, and why they believed the AMA to be legit; but I cannot speak for them. </p>

<p>Good, let&#39;s see it. Thanks.</p>

<p>Edit: Or, at the very least, tell us what the other mods have done to authenticate the voracity of that mod&#39;s story about it, which apparently involved an attempt by that mod to verify this &quot;Richard_Gage&quot; troll/shill, including twitter and email verifications.. ie: what email domain did it come from and what twitter account was used? That&#39;s easy enough to ask them to provide, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s safe to assume this &quot;user&quot; is a multiple. And has probably already had many other old accounts in place to default in case of emergency. Seamless transition. That&#39;s my concern with having inactive mods here that were once very active on reddit. I&#39;m not implying that they themselves would do anything nefarious. But reddit might. For the right amount. And I&#39;m not sure who the mod is responsible for coordinating the AMA but now is the perfect opportunity for them to explain. Most of you know me on some level and I&#39;m not one to rock the boat. But I am in some way willing to rock it given the current state of affairs. </p>

<p>So, you&#39;ve got no actual evidence, for one; except for some anecdotal bullshit.</p>

<p>More evidence of there being a core group of conspiracy posters (all just from this thread lol):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2ns0w9/new_moderators_and_an_announcement_regarding_a/cmgibxk">link 1</a> -- Obviously u/creq and nerf_gun_hero are part of the group I described</p>

<p>Honestly you surprise me with your dull arguments. I don&#39;t know what incentive you have to waste everyone&#39;s time but something something maybe you&#39;re working for the government. I was able to put together a mountain of evidence from a tiny thread using only my phone. I hope we&#39;re not relying on your pathetic investigation skills to crack the case on 9/11</p>

<p>Since I went to all this trouble I would appreciate it if you would respond with an admission of your ignorance or stupidity. Or you can just use a lot of bold letters and hand-waving to shout about why you think my evidence doesn&#39;t count. I know that&#39;s more likely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Here we are, and thank you for bringing it to light indeed. This being called out is quite an important revelation to anyone who uses this sub. Either as an individual seeking deeper truths, questioning current events, or a person posting. It ties into many aspects on many levels. Even the entire format of verification can be hoaxed if given enough time and effort. I prefer how James Corbett provided his verification. It was solid. He was able to answer questions in real time and by video. I say that if an individual asked to do an AMA doesn&#39;t understand current technology and is unable to be shown properly how to use the reddit format, and cannot provide verification that&#39;s solid; then I vote for them to not do an AMA here. Just my two cents. I didn&#39;t even ask a question in Gage&#39;s AMA because my intuition knew something was really off about it. </p>

<p>I think that a LOT of us felt that way. We were so hyped about it, in anticipation and then this stooge with a bad attitude shows up in the place of Richard Gage. </p>

<p>It really is quite hilarious too at some level, so I can understand why <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2ns0w9/new_moderators_and_an_announcement_regarding_a/cmgu2gu">this episode is being mocked in other areas of reddit</a>, but that&#39;s bad news too for the sake of the truth and what&#39;s right, so at another level it&#39;s not funny at all. </p>

<p>The mods have done well to post this stickied topic but at the same time, I haven&#39;t seen everything that needs to be considered so as to be certain that the sub can make a fresh start from a new base. </p>

<p>Therefore I think there may be a  certain mod (axolotl_peyotl) who was involved with this and bringing it to r/conspiracy who needs to resign their position as a mod of this subreddit, which doesn&#39;t preclude their ability to continue to participate here mind you, just not be a mod any more. </p>

<p>axolotl_peyotl. </p>

<p>He bobbled it, for a variety of reasons, and even though it might have been done unwittingly, at the same time there might have been a slight predisposed bias on the part of the mod in regards to the work of Richard Gage and Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth which made him the perfect mark let us say to bring about the ruse and then support it&#39;s outcome. </p>

<p>Therefore, for the sake of the absolute integrity and continuity of the moderation of this subreddit with a long history, he should step down even if only as an affirmation of that same integrity. Doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s entirely to blame or to be hung out to dry or banned, just step down as mod it&#39;s no big deal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Congrats to the new mods. And thanks to the current mods for allowing us users to see the votes out of &quot;contest mode&quot;. I was speaking with Axolotl about this lastnight. We also discussed making a statement from the mods on this serious issue, and if Richard was contacted directly from mods here. I&#39;m glad you guys did. I find it odd that the head mod here and at <a href="/r/911Truth">/r/911Truth</a>  is the same mod <a href="/u/illuminatedwax">/u/illuminatedwax</a> . This mod is also moderator of over 50 (some very popular) subs, and hasn&#39;t publicly addressed this issue with Richard Gage. Perhaps our newest mod <a href="/u/Orangutan">/u/Orangutan</a> can answer this question for me as they as well mod at 911Truth? I spoke with a current mod about this issue lastnight too.  I understand illuminatedwax isn&#39;t involved with many of the subs that are moderated by him/her. But this is a serious issue involving the credibility of both important subs.  I hope you will continue to keep us informed on relevant updates regarding this, and that we will not have to come to you for important informations on this matter. Or even hear about it in a users self post. In addition to all of the current news I am going to pose my question again about mods who&#39;s accounts seem to be inactive. <a href="/u/quantumcipher">/u/quantumcipher</a> and <a href="/u/Three_Letter_Agency">/u/Three_Letter_Agency</a>. I respect both of their past histories here and elsewhere. But it is concerning to me that their accounts have been inactive for quite some time now. Will they be removed and replaced by the new mods? Flytape and I were discussing this lastnight. There are potential &quot;security breeches&quot; that could occur with leaving inactive mods here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Lots of questions, and always seeking answers. And I&#39;d also add a big mahalo nui loa to <a href="/u/NAM007">/u/NAM007</a> for the important heads up. </p>

<p>This is true; and it is very disconcerting that wax has been unable to get <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> unbanned from <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a> (another sub that he mods). </p>

<p>From what I understand, quatum has fallen quite ill and Three_Letter_Agency is working on a book. We&#39;d like to reach out to them before removing them from the mod team. We certainly understand your concerns regarding the security of the sub and we appreciate your vigilance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply. Your answer is somewhat a mirror image of Flytapes. I&#39;m sorry to hear about quantumcipher. I proposed he be a mod in the last vote. I did know about TLA&#39;s book. I hope you do reach out to them. And I hope someone other than I is diligent enough to look into fine details like this. I&#39;m not sure what a diplomatic solution is to the situation with inactive mods. 900sins is another one. But these are back doors than can be easily entered by someone with knowhow. And given the recent event with the Gage AMA, I&#39;d be on high alert status as a mod. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was part of his reply to me on another thread</p>

<p>Me: Did you not notice something rather unusual or &quot;off&quot; about Richard&#39;s responses?</p>

<p>Him: Most definitely. In the interest of complete disclosure, having been researching 911 truth for over a decade, I&#39;ve never been a big fan of Gage and his message, although I certainly respect him.</p>

<p>Although I was disappointed with his answers, I&#39;m disappointed in Gage and the 911 truth movement in general so I wasn&#39;t surprised by that. I think that clouded my judgment.</p>

<p>Me: first and foremost being the INCONGRUITY of it.</p>

<p>Him: Obviously no one wants to be duped. We&#39;ve seen it all at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, mods and regular users alike. We&#39;ve been attacked elsewhere on reddit and the internet in general. We&#39;ve become hyper-vigilant to that kind of bullshit, and honestly it&#39;s slowed down dramatically from the past.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t appear to have been an attack on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, which is why it&#39;s so damn weird. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still not entirely sure what &quot;this&quot; was.</p>

<p>Me: I do not trust that you are on the right team.</p>

<p>Him: You could be right. Again, this was not entirely on me, but if someone needs to take the fall, I&#39;d be happy to. Internet stress like this is only worth it up to a point...</p>

<p>from the thread</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/911truth/comments/2npaby/off_topic_uaxolotl_peyotl_top_7_mod_on/">[Off Topic] /u/axolotl_peyotl, top 7 mod on /r/conspiracy is a compromised account.</a></p>

<p>Says he&#39;s still not entirely sure what &quot;this&quot; was... decade long 9/11 researcher, but never a big fan of Richard Gage and his organization..  dissapointed in him, his organization and the 911 truth movement in general..</p>

<p>INCONGRUENT is right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I certainly hope they will, although it is a holiday weekend so it is understandable that folks have other matters to attend to.</p>

<p>The only reason I have the ability to be here during literally every second of this is because I am quite ill, and am incapable of doing much else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the idea of a mod veto, as long as it was backed by  mod-majority with supporting evidence.  A veto combined with minimum standards would&#39;ve been a fine solution.  Maybe next time. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t you think the absence of a vouch is basically the same thing as a majority veto?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  It&#39;s not the same thing.  Your vouch is influencing the vote, even if we can&#39;t see it.  Not only does it limit the debate to the chosen few, one mod is not a majority veto.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not patronizing you, I&#39;m attempting to answer your questions. I have a feeling it was a failed venture before it began.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you start off pretentiously asking what &#39;injustice someone has perceived&#39;, it tends to put people on the defense.  Just sayin.</p>

<p>I disagree with the manner in which this vote was conducted.  It is a failed venture to attempt to sway my opinion from transparency to concealment, you are 100% correct.</p>

<p>I am not out to get you.  I am seeking an alternative system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% agree with you on that, I don&#39;t really know what the solution is especially when, for instance, our head mod hasn&#39;t made an appearance in months (as far as I&#39;m aware).  He could literally show up tomorrow, decide to say &quot;fuck this sub&quot; and remove us all as mods and delete every post and there isn&#39;t a thing we could do about it.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t seem right.  But again, not sure what the solution is for things like that - seems like open discussion is key to solving those types of problems.</p>
