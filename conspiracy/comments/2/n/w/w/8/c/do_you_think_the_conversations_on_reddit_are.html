<p>dude. this. I see this all. the. fucking. time. </p>

<p>I like to do this: I troll with some facts, and then round it out with some conspiracy ideas  (No Agenda show, anyone?) Attitudes are almost always the same -- outright derision. There&#39;s no room for growth, or at the very least, discussion of said ideas. Just &quot;no, you&#39;re wrong&quot; in so many ways. </p>

<p>Have you ever tried to explain to an Obamabot that Obamacare doesn&#39;t fix the problem of health insurance because health insurance is the problem? It only eliminates the barrier to entry (which still cost decent money!) I once suggested that Obama could be more effective with executive actions when it came to changing the shape of health insurance, and I was ridiculed on that. </p>

<p>guess how many people want to hug obama on his executive action for immigration? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The human shills are definitely on the increase. Thankfully, they&#39;re quite easy to spot. They will generally:</p>

<ul>
<li>Frequent subs that require very little specialist knowledge (music, movies, TV, etc.);</li>
<li>Accuse anyone who doesn&#39;t have a mainstream opinion of an event (9/11, Sandy Hook, etc.) of being ghoulish;</li>
<li>Talk to you like they&#39;ve got a PHD in critical thought and suggest that you&#39;re either stupid or a lunatic (or both) for not agreeing with their views;</li>
<li>Try and intimidate you with ridiculously bloated and condescending prose, generally in the way an adult would talk down to a petulant child.</li>

<p>Why would someone who disagrees with conspiracies be posting in r/conspiracy, though? Surely this is the one sub they <em>don&#39;t</em> want to be in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not always botting.  </p>

<p>There is a never ending supply of people who get their panties in a twist for one reason or another, usually when they&#39;ve been proven wrong or are over-emotional young adults.</p>

<p>This can manifest in many ways: stalking and downvoting all pf a user&#39;s comment history, copying and pasting irrelevant attacks based on a user&#39;s history, or even manipulating votes (like <a href="/u/unidan">/u/unidan</a> got caught doing) by using multiple accounts to influence public perspective.</p>

<p>I could be wrong, but most of the trolls fall into the category above, ie the petulant deceptive child mindset rather than automated bots.</p>

<p>But yeah, there are at least <em>some</em> bots doing similar things, just not on the same scale.  I hope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn’t doubt it if my posts in r/worldnews (and other major subs) are eyeballed and brigaded (most likely by humans!). Techniques seem to be: downvotes, comments using negative language which have nothing to do with my comment, stacking comments above mine which results in my comment being pushed down, the entire article/post being erased by mod or user...</p>

<p>Of course this isn’t happening every time I post a comment or link--but one day I think these techniques were used on me in 3 consecutive comments I made. A large part of it is the subjective enforcement of the rules which the mods in the larger subreddits censor the articles with. </p>

<p>Articles questioning authority (Pentagon, CIA) seem to be stricken from the record. I feel this is dangerous--imagine if the MSM had allowed more voices of dissent in the run up to the Iraq invasion in 2003.</p>

<p>In the same way people stare at downsyndrome kids, sure you don&#39;t have downsyndrome, but it is funny to laugh at them</p>

<p>There are very few people in the world who can make a funny Down&#39;s syndrome gag and my guess is that you are not one of those people. You&#39;d get booed off the playground for that one. Shameful display.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not always botting.  </p>

<p>There is a never ending supply of people who get their panties in a twist for one reason or another, usually when they&#39;ve been proven wrong or are over-emotional young adults.</p>

<p>This can manifest in many ways: stalking and downvoting all pf a user&#39;s comment history, copying and pasting irrelevant attacks based on a user&#39;s history, or even manipulating votes (like <a href="/u/unidan">/u/unidan</a> got caught doing) by using multiple accounts to influence public perspective.</p>

<p>I could be wrong, but most of the trolls fall into the category above, ie the petulant deceptive child mindset rather than automated bots.</p>

<p>But yeah, there are at least <em>some</em> bots doing similar things, just not on the same scale.  I hope.</p>
