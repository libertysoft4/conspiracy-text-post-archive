    <div class="md"><p>Seriously: how can anybody buy this? I&#39;ll never understand how you self-professed &quot;skeptics&quot; manage to suspend every facet of disbelief for the sake of letting yourselves get carried away with these unsubstantiated theories. Sandy Hook was staged? An entire town? All those lives? They went to the trouble of calling all those &quot;actors&quot; in and then gave them nothing to do? Thousands of corroborating reports? Did anybody actually die? There are too many loose ends, anybody can see this. Obviously Adam Lanza was, in fact, an Agent of Change who had been groomed since puberty by the NWO, unbeknownst to even his family (did his mother find out? Is that why she was killed? Probably, yes). Was the intense conditioning and the duality of his repto-humanoid transformation due to NWO reprogramming the cause of his gloominess, aloofness, paranoia, antisocial behavior? I can link several sources proving his huge behavioral shifts after puberty. I guess my only question is: what did Nancy see? Sandy Hook was a true tragedy and 27 victims lost their lives there. Don&#39;t you see what a small price the lives of 26 children are to the NWO? You don&#39;t think they&#39;ll go to those lengths to push the globalization of their Zionist agenda on us all? Wake up people. This shit is real. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the worst press violation occurred in August 1944, when due to procedural errors a nationwide Mutual Network broadcast mentioned the military creating a weapon in Pasco, Washington involving atom splitting. The Office of Censorship asked all recordings of the broadcast to be destroyed... That was not the first request for voluntary censorship of atomic-related information. Price noted in comments to reporters after the end of censorship that <strong>some 20,000 news outlets had been delivered similar requests</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>20,000</strong> potential leaks, which they were able to cap <em>temporarily</em>, by appealing to media patriotism, because there was a war on, and maintaining secrecy was clearly in national interests. Not the case with Sandy Hook. Of course, once the plan was executed,  details came out <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0806.html">the very next morning</a>. Not the case with Sandy Hook, where two years on, there&#39;s little or no objective evidence to support the hoax theory.</p>

<p>There were <a href="http://io9.com/secrets-of-the-manhattan-project-were-leaked-a-staggeri-1626524763">1,500 actual, investigated cases</a> of information leaking. Not the case with Sandy Hook. And that&#39;s not even counting the very successful acquisition of data by foreign powers - no country has made any allegations about Sandy Hook. </p>

<p>tl;dr The Manhatten Project leaked like a rusty sieve. It&#39;s radically different from Sandy Hook, but actually provides good evidence for why Sandy Hook was NOT a government op.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media clearly wasn&#39;t &quot;oblivious&quot;: I repeat, it took <strong>20,000 gag orders</strong>, with official government sanction which is just not possible in a case like Sandy Hook. And so instead, of necessity, the conspiracy there now must extend to cover every single media outlet, without exception, that was present, from CNN to the Newtown Bee - because it would only take one to break ranks and the game would be up. <strong>Not one has</strong>. In fact, I do not know of a single person who was in Newtown that day who supports the hoax hypothesis. The entire town must be in on it!</p>

<p>Yep, there is a ridiculous theory here, that&#39;s for certain. But it&#39;s not mine. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this is the case. I think that if any of it is staged almost no one involved knows it.</p>

<p>This is partly why the drills are important.
But if you read the Operations Northwoods document you will find plans in there in which people who appear involved in a conspiracy were actually being tricked by the conspirators. People who are involved don&#39;t always need to know it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the silhouette narration is new, but almost everything in the video looks like rehashes of things that have been posted before. Most of it is easily debunked.</p>

<p>I did learn one new thing from the video. The envelope that had the DNA on it from a convicted offender in New York was not found at either crime scene. It was sent through the mail, postmarked in New York two days <em>after</em> the shooting. The envelope said it was from Peter Lanza, but it was a hoax. It was one thing that was pretty mysterious, but now it&#39;s not.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the news report that&#39;s included in video: <a href="http://wtnh.com/2014/10/01/after-long-battle-for-access-sandy-hook-letter-offers-little/">http://wtnh.com/2014/10/01/after-long-battle-for-access-sandy-hook-letter-offers-little/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want me to believe this documentary is bunk, tell me what the claims are that are false. The documentary itself exposed the letter and spent very little time on it but presented a fuck ton of other claims. Can you debunk the entire documentary rather than cherry picking a claim that the documentary debunked itself?</p>

<p>Please start with the bing and google cache issue first then reveal why there is no evidence of almost 500 kids being evacuated and why the dead bodies were left in the school for a couple days. Then continue on with the claims the documentary presents. I eagerly await your post, I have a feeling it should be extremely long. Thank you kind redditor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have time to go into detail about everything today, because I have work to do, but some things are easily disposed of.</p>

<p>Sherrie QuestioningAll complains that she can&#39;t see any children being evacuated on the police dash cam tape. The fact that there are numerous sections blacked out on the tape wasn&#39;t a big enough clue for her. She&#39;s compares the timeline (provided by the Connecticut State Police) to the video tape (also provided by the Connecticut State Police) and finds that they don&#39;t match up. The solution is obvious: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1zprpi/they_lied_sandy_hook_police_dash_cam_video_does/cfw7t10">the camera on the clock was off by about 80 seconds</a>. In fact, if you dig through the police reports, <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-YeEgq5sO7NSVRLOFNjaGl1SlE&amp;amp;usp=sharing&amp;amp;tid=0B-YeEgq5sO7NeVkyUlhvNnlkZ0E">one of them says that</a>, &quot;The times reported on LT (MSGT) Michael Davis&#39; dash cam video were found to be off by One (1) minute and twenty-one (21) seconds. Therefore one (1) minute and twenty-one (21) seconds needs to be added to the times reported.&quot; Two of the other dash cams were off by smaller amounts.</p>

<p>The dates that are reported on the Google search page are often wrong. Lots of people found examples at the time (December 2012). In fact, it&#39;s easy to reproduce. Just go to Google, search for some news that happened recently, then use the Search Tools on the search result page to search for a custom date range that ends before the event actually happened. You&#39;ll find lots of web pages that seemingly could see the future: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Karageorge+Found+Dead&amp;amp;source=lnt&amp;amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A%2Ccd_max%3A11%2F25%2F2014&amp;amp;tbm=">https://www.google.com/search?q=Karageorge+Found+Dead&amp;amp;source=lnt&amp;amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A%2Ccd_max%3A11%2F25%2F2014&amp;amp;tbm=</a></p>

<p>So that date error isn&#39;t at all unusual.</p>

<p>The Bing cache date error shouldn&#39;t happen, but Microsoft has literally tens of thousands of servers for Bing, and <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-time-service-not-working-synchronization-fails-error">sometimes Windows Time Service doesn&#39;t work</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to police reports almost 500 kids were evacuated at 9:58am. Give or take a wrong clock by 1 or 2 minutes, is it conceivable to you that you can evacuate that many kids in less then a minute? The redacted video content was when a detective ran across the parking lot with a single kid. The other redacted content lasted less then a minute. You can&#39;t evacuate that many children in any time frame that has been presented even if the clocks were wrong by a minute.</p>

<p>The Windows Time Service link you conferred details a localized issue and does not refute any claim. Those are synchronization problems between a computer and internet time. Microsoft themselves issued a statement that the web crawler dates were correct. </p>

<p>Either way I don&#39;t believe the crawler issues are a smoking gun. But interesting anomalies. What else ya got?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what the police reports say. There are children and redacted adults crossing the parking lot from 9:56 to 10:22, at least. And the timeline only has a record of those who passed in front of the car. Since the sidewalk to the fire station was behind the car, most children probably went that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, thanks for the reply. A lot of those instances were single students and teachers crossing the parking lot without enough redacted content in the vid to verify them (even taking into account the wrong clock). Also, it doesn&#39;t make sense to me why they would go in the opposite direction of the firehouse just to stay on the sidewalk (behind the dashcam). But I can&#39;t say they didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>I guess one of the biggest hurdles for me was the amount of children and staff that evacuated without any pictures or evidence. Just seems like a shitload of kids not to get a picture. Anyways, thanks for the post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you do it for personal reasons, its profit. Anyone who continues to dig up this story definitely wants the truth because the whole thing stinks. Frankly I don&#39;t contest it much because 1) there are bigger fish to fry 2) they are coming for your personally owned firearms whether you like it or not.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t mean I question it. One could question ANY big story heavily covered by the Mainstream Media, because by the time it reaches that point its become a life of its own. If its separated from reality, it can be manipulated. There was also the rumblings of propaganda/lies now being legal on news programs. So there you have it.</p>

<p>The main thing <em>I&#39;M</em> concerned with is how modern conspiracy theory is mostly based off of what the Main Stream Media covers instead of back-alley forums and IRC rooms teeming with hackers or journalists that are sharing gathered intelligence, AKA true non-mainstream information that is legitimate, well researched, and thorough.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, &quot;info&quot; that reaches this far has two forms: true legit down to earth people who get wiped out before they can repeat their message enough times, either through threats, intimidation, professional sabotage, and &quot;suicide&quot;. These seem like nice people with spooky and sudden changes in luck.</p>

<p>The second form is a media outlet that unfortunately has to make its money just like any other media company out there. Because they need to maintain viewership to retain cash flow to fund the operation of the &quot;message,&quot; they have to pump out a 24 hour conspiracy news cycle and the &quot;bar&quot; for what they pass off as their original &quot;info&quot; craters. They lose credibility, they are attacked by the establishment as profiteers and fear mongers, and the world moves on. These are your infowars, your thecommonsenseblog, shtfplan, zero hedge, the list goes on.</p>

<p>So with Sandy Hook you get all the reactions you need, both from the mainstream and the independent media. The fact that the &quot;sense&quot; about &quot;Sandy Hoaxers&quot; is that they are all conspiratards just proves the point. For every 1 person a Sandy Hook video changes or convinces, it re-inforces 100 that the original story they heard is true. One could almost think the conspiracies are what gives the establishment its credibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TI are largely schizophrenics who latch on to this dangerous theory through the internet. The more they are mentally ill, the more they believe.</p>

<p>TIs may speak of hearing voices, but also see ridiculous &quot;hints.&quot; They see people making gestures towards them to &quot;trigger&quot; them. On youtube you will find tons of videos of &quot;TIs&quot; videotaping people just standing around scratching their nose or other things.</p>

<p>I have also seen videos of them video taping normal glares of light that they claim are from a machine of some sort, or dust that is a shadows people.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Sadly these people mostly likely do not seek help because of their illness. I mean the mostly likely people to also be in on &quot;it&quot; is a therapist or doctor. This leads to things like that FSU shooting.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a really horrible mental illnesss.</p>

<p>A lot of their stories seem to have parallels - can they <em>all</em> be making it up?

<p>That&#39;s a reasonable conclusion to make. </p>

<p>I browse <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and am skeptical of all conspiracies. Things skeptics like me always say, why hasn&#39;t anyone come forward? (usually when a person &quot;comes forward,&quot; its just someone writing BS on a blog site or just a unsubstantiated lie for attention)</p>

<p>But who&#39;s to say someone did try to come forward, but was called Schizophrenic and directed to a therapist. This is different because of how they might have evidence, but are viewed as delusional. (Saying all these people are following me, that they hear messages). The evidence might be actually real, but un-provable.</p>

<p>Either way at the moment it&#39;s speculation but an wonderfully terrible idea to think about.</p>
