        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi. I was able to understand that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a great place to gather conspiracy related news. But I am looking for a quite place to discuss my own conspiracy theories. As far as I was able to understand this sub has very strict rules that limit you from expressing your thoughts freely.</p>

<p>Right now I was able to find these subs:</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspirology">/r/conspirology</a></p>

<p><a href="/r/Collapse">/r/Collapse</a></p>

<p><a href="/r/conspirators">/r/conspirators</a></p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiratocracy">/r/conspiratocracy</a></p>

<p>The <a href="/r/conspirology">/r/conspirology</a> sub seems to be the best I have seen. It has a lot of info on the sidebar that really helps thinking, and has no restrictive rules to freely expressing myslef. I am thinking to post there right now. Do you know any sub that is better than those I have?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to discuss the jewish involvement in the world wide conspiracy. Also I would like to call a troll or shill whoever would disturb my logoc flow of thoughts from progressing.</p>

<p>As you see the rules do not allow me to talk me freely.</p>

<p>I also wonder why these rules were made here, if usually Reddit forums use the oringinal Reddit riles made by Aron, which are combined with the Goled Rule? Why there are additional rules here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can talk about any race/ethnicity/religion you want as long as you don&#39;t use slurs; but there will likely be trolls and shills trying to derail at every step.</p>

<p>The trolls/shills will do this in most any public subreddit which isn&#39;t private, though.  You can make a private sub, but then how do you get enough contributers?</p>

<p>You&#39;d have to ask the mods why there&#39;s so many rules.  Honestly, I wish the mods were more apt to ban here.  It used to be that way quite a long time ago but I think a lot of the prior mods got burnt out.</p>

<p>A big change started occurring when, for whatever reasons, the sub started worrying about its reputation within the larger reddit community; I would say that this mindset was a negative aspect from the get-go and is why we have so many restrictions now.</p>

<p>Again, these are just my opinions as I can&#39;t speak for anyone but myself and I must point out that there is far more to it than the oversimplifications I&#39;ve provided.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just the rules.  This place gets overrun by r/conspiratard users.  I&#39;ve read multiple discussions that get downvote brigaded after the post gets x-posted to r/conspiratard.  The r/conspiratards claim it&#39;s just another one of our &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;, but it&#39;s blatantly obvious when comments have a number of upvotes, the thread gets x-posted, all of a sudden the regular users here get downvoted to oblivion, and comments insulting or critical of users here get upvoted to the top.  Nothing&#39;s being done to stop it either, but rules have been put into place to stop us from calling them out and defending ourselves.  I&#39;m using this sub less and less, and I&#39;m also looking for alternatives too.  OP, let me know what you find.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, as I said, the best place I was able to find on Reddit is <a href="/r/conspirology">/r/conspirology</a> because they seem to be genuinely interested in allowing free discussions. I am not even worying about those conspiratads, I am just saying that here the rules are very weird, and do not allow free speech. On conspirology sub is the contrary, they are allowing any kind of free speech that help discussing conspiracies.</p>

<p>I also saw that <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> is not on their sidebar links, and they say do not trust nobody who is not listed there. Do you konw why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, like I said, there are reasons why I don&#39;t post on those sites, but plenty of real people do post there and post interesting things that are worth reading that you won&#39;t see here (and fewer longwinded YouTubes posted over there, thank ye gods and more astronomical/earth stuff). LOP was spun-off from GLP, so I wouldn&#39;t trust it, either, but still, some good people posting interesting things from time to time over there.</p>
