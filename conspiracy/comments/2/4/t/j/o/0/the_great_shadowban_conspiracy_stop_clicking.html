        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The admins claim that conspiracy <a href="http://i.imgur.com/QUHXjn7.jpg">&quot;brigades&quot; WAY more</a> than anyone else.  Let&#39;s just skip over the very loose interpretation they have about what constitutes brigading and instead focus on totes meta bot and other bots that post in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> when a thread is cross-posted elsewhere.</p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/24spur/why_are_there_so_many_people_in_this_sub_that/chae90c">Example of a totes meta bot post</a> </p>

<p>Every time anyone clicks those links and votes, they&#39;re subject to a shadowban.  Now take a step back and think about how often conspiratard x-posts material and generates one of those posts?  10-20 times a day?  More?  How many people have no clue that clicking those links and voting is a shadowbannable offense?  </p>

<p>Did you know that conspiratard banned all of those bots?  Probably for this reason.</p>

<p>I&#39;d ask that the person that created that bot stop posting direct links, or just delete the bot totally.  We know they do nothing but cross post to their sub.  There&#39;s no way to stop it, so just let them play their karma circlejerk games and report their bs to the admins when it&#39;s appropriate.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sending this thread to the mods to see if they have any input.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think the admins of this site haven&#39;t taken into consideration the creation of alts? If that were the case, someone who wanted to get their content to the top of the front page each and every time they submitted something, they could just open a hundred new browser windows and create a hundred new accounts. You yourself can test it right now -- create 2 or 3 throwaway accounts, after that they&#39;ll start getting shadowbanned automatically the second your IP address creates a new one. </p>

<p>The vast majority of anti-spam / vote manipulation / brigade punishment happens through algorithms, not the whims of an individual reddit admin. </p>

<p>Every time you click a link, your browser communicates to the server (re: reddit) that it came to that page by following a link. </p>

<p>When reddit&#39;s algorithm says &quot;hmm, sure is fishy -- 300 people followed a link from subreddit X to subreddit Y, and 75% of them downvoted the post&quot;? You&#39;re all going to get flagged for brigading. </p>

<p>The people who have alts on this sub are probably people who realize talking publicly about their bizarre theories could hurt their professional or private lives. An employer or a friend or a relative could see that they believe 9/11 was a Zionist conspiracy, so they want to keep things private. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not blaming you -- a number of people across a string of subreddits I follow have recently revealed that they know little about the site-wide reddit admin&#39;s job, their capacity/resources, etc. It is pretty confusing. </p>

<p>But if you think that a reddit admin is sitting at a terminal and saying &quot;hmmm, 400 of our site&#39;s 40B up/downvotes this year can be traced back to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, we should ban them&quot;? </p>

<p>That&#39;s magical thinking.</p>

<p>&quot;Do your own research man! I won&#39;t break down this complex situation in to easily understood points tailored specifically to this conversation to help you understand my point of view or the facts that support my case, I&#39;ll just make a vague reference to something sinister sounding. The truth is out there, only the sheep don&#39;t understand the true rulers of reddit. reddit&#39;s admins have never published the long-form source code of the website, we don&#39;t know what truly happens beneath the hood.

    <div class="md"><p>I took him offline for a while.  Started working on other bots and whatnot.</p>

<p>But I know that this is a problem.  First thing I noticed when I launched the bot was that both sides do the <em>same exact thing</em> in regards to <em>brigading</em>.</p>

<p>I think that removing bots will help, but it&#39;s kind of a double edged sword.  I don&#39;t want to sit here and argue with someone from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> because I know that they are probably set in their beliefs and it will just turn in to an argument.  If the bot shows me that there has been a cross post I know there is a chance that I&#39;m talking to a troll.  </p>

<p>But Ocolus_the_bot should be down.  If not, I&#39;m willing to take him offline.</p>

<p>Edit:  another solution would be to add disclaimers in the bots message stating not to vote on the links.</p>

If people want to go to that hate-group normally and find the x-post themselves, then they won&#39;t be vulnerable to the fuzzily-defined &quot;brigading&quot; infraction.
