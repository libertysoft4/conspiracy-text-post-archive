<p>Last night I had SHOCKING sleep. I&#39;m fairly sure I didn&#39;t sleep all night, and felt like my mind was whirring with the same thoughts over and over, which I can normally control. I actually felt pretty anxious because of it, and had a pretty crummy day yesterday.</p>

<p>On another forum a user posted about having a horrible time sleeping, and found that many people they went to Uni with also had disturbed sleep, and this person even started asking random people who also had poor sleep. The post was on abovetopsecret.com&#39;s front page, but I can&#39;t find it now. The first part of this title sans the bracket info was taken from it.</p>

<p>How did you sleep on the night of the 29th? I know this is a very unscientific way to go about things, but as I said before, it would be interesting to hear some feedback. </p>

<p>See if your personal disturbance matches up with magnetosphere disturbance.</p>

<p>I&#39;m disabled by vestibular nerve damage; I feel crappy everyday.My daily life feels like riding my imaginary mechanical bull, on my imaginary boat, on my imaginary roiling body of water - thus my user name.  I feel worse when under low pressure weather systems.  I noticed though when the weather was clear and I was still feeling extra aggghhhh that our magnetosphere was compressed or skewed at those times.  </p>

<p>I am making no claims just remarking on my experiences and observations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Numerous chemical sensitivities brought adult onset obstructive asthma with chronic sinusitis and bronchitis, leading to chronic BPPV (the otoconia, little stones in your inner ear system get pushed out of place), which in turn caused vestibular (balance system) nerve damage over time. The sinus issues always reacted (more swelling, pressure) during low pressure systems.  I think we all react to magnetosphere anomalies to some degree or another.  Observation allows for pattern recognition of what otherwise appears to be chaotic or random occurrences. I guess since I can&#39;t control how I feel (miserable), I try to understand everything that may contribute to it.  (sigh )</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maine, USA here. I slept very sound, in fact more so than usual. However, and I find OP&#39;s post very interesting now, the night of the 27th I went to bed and I could hear that damn humming noise again. 1st time in over a year. I actually got out of bed and looked around outside. Nothing was out there but, like the last few times I could hear it...no matter where I was. It sounds like it&#39;s off in the distance. Anyway, I went to bed and slept like shit all night. When I closed my eyes to try and sleep, I saw light through my eyelids as if there was a light on in the room. I was like wtf? I woke up a cranky bastard, went to work and hardly said a word to anyone all day. </p>

<p>Also, sometime ago, I ended up on some new agey kind of site...there was an article about mass sleep disturbance. They were saying that sometimes peoples sleep patterns change for several months after these &quot;events&quot;.</p>

<p>The most likely people to respond to this thread are people who didn&#39;t sleep well. </p>

<p>I am guessing that this will strengthen your belief that there is some global phenomenon that interrupted everybody&#39;s sleep. Now all you need are a couple of popular memes to explain it.  Already in this thread, people have mentioned the magnetosphere, and HAARP. </p>

<p>Now every time there&#39;s a solar flare that disturbed the magnetosphere, you can ask if people had trouble sleeping to strengthen the association in your mind.</p>

<p>This is exactly why we need science to tell true from false. </p>

<p>Wrong. Your theory is off if people here are reporting a different sleep pattern than other nights. So the whole confirmation bias you mentioned does not apply. I can&#39;t imagine a person who has chronic sleeping problems would respond to this thread. Bye.</p>

<p>And I agree. Everyone has a rough night every now and then and this sub has a considerable amount of subscribers, so it doesn&#39;t matter on which day one would ask &quot;did you sleep well last night?&quot; and the results are about the same.</p>

<p>I slept normally last night, didn&#39;t also hear anyone else near me complain of an abnormal night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct.  Anecdotal evidence can be a basis for further inquiry, but it&#39;s flawed science.</p>

<p>Science also has a brick wall up to prevent listening to much anecdotal evidence in some cases, such as citizens living near fracking wells who can light their tap water on fire.  Paid industry &quot;science&quot; shills declare it&#39;s merely methane and a common occurance.  </p>

<p>So I can see a divide on both sides.</p>

<p>Awful here in Ireland. Can&#39;t believe I just deleted all my lovely smooth sleeps, but this is definitely the worst in a while (recorded nightly with Sleep As Android) </p>

<p>Started tossing and turning around 0330 GMT. Not the most tired today though</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Similar scenario here in west Kerry Ireland last night! Full on internal dialogue for hours which I just couldn&#39;t silence! Freaky stuff. It&#39;s the 29th here tonight. I&#39;ll update in the morning for a bit of craic!</p>

<p>Edit: ok, worst nights sleep of my life just ocoured. A nightmare that I remember vividly (I usually never remember my dream) I wasn&#39;t the main character I was on some sort of medical looking bed completely unconcious while others we trying to wake me up with some peculiar looking syringe. Before they could empty this syringe into me they were shot dead. This was followed by the same man that killed them jamming another syringe deep into my chest. I woke up with crippling sleep paralysis with what felt like a huge weight on my chest, it felt like my heart was going to explode as I struggled to breathe. This was followed by the unmistakable sensation of static electricity pulsing through my head with an audible crackle! After finally breaking through the paralysis and gasping for a breath, I tried to force myself back to sleep which is where my night took a turn for the &#39;weird&#39;. As I shut my eyes these strange looking lines emitting a purple Hugh started aranging themselves paralel to each other at a slight angle and then further into much more complex shapes which culminated with what could only be described as &#39;x-ray vision&#39;?! I had to keep touching my eyes to make sure they were closed as I consider mysel to be a rational man. To my surprise they were shut tight however I could still see everything in my room. I don&#39;t really know what else to say other than I am slightly disturbed by the whole experience. As I read through this I&#39;m perfectly aware that it sounds a bit like ramblings of a mad man and I am not usually compelled to participate in any thread on social media sites, however, I can probably chalk this down to one of the most profound experiences of my 26 years on this planet and I&#39;m not sure there are many people I can share this experience with...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Several bouts of sleep paralysis, i could see even though my eyes were closed) i knewmthey were closed because when I moved my hand (which I could see) it moved at about a frame every 2 to 3 seconds. Now, people who have never experienced this let me tell you: youll be fully aware and able to think, feel, and also breathe and make decisions, but you are completley utterly powerless to move. At around this stage, (paralysis but conscious) you have to consciously &quot;will&quot; your mind to kind of....burst through the paralysis into conscious and able to move state. Heres where the weirdness occurred for me last night: after each attempt to &quot;burst&quot; through the paralysis, I would hear a clearly audible electric buzzing noise which would increase in intensity in correlation with how much you try to &quot;resist&quot; the paralysis. After the fourth break through attempt I succeeded in waking up (of course accompanied by a giant gasp for breath (like you see after people dive for a long time)). When I regained control  and blinked or closed my eyes, I could see geometric patterns (beween being 4 and 7 sided) with numbers next to the shapes, not unlike a schematic. They were animated, moving and blinking a light green and light blue color. The effect was similar to staring at a brightly lit sign, then looking away and closing your eyes, leaving the &quot;imprint&quot; in your field of vision.</p>

<p>I live in the mountains of Georgia and slept like shit, woke up 4-5 times and had a nosebleed.</p>

<p>Also had wicked vivid nightmares. All military in nature as well. Two involved fighting UN attempting to take a town, two were taking out a DHS installation with a small team and the last one was defending the same as the first town from looters. </p>

<p>I slept like shit last night too with more wicked nightmares. </p>
