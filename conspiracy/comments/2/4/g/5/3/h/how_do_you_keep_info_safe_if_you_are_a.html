    <div class="md"><p>Because in our society we have been conditioned to think certain subjects are a joke. That is how they have been kept secret. So when I try to give this info to people their natural instinct is to assume I am just a mental case. But that reaction is something that has been ingeniously crafted over something like 60 years at least... </p>

<p>Imagine if I was to try to tell people the tooth fairy is real. That actually might be easier to convince people of than the info I have discovered. It&#39;s not unlike how conspiracy theories and theorists have been demonized.</p>

<p>So because of this I am worried it may just get lost in the shuffle. Also.. this requires looking into many sources such as books and long documentaries. Few people will want to go to those lengths plus they are copyrighted so disseminating all that info is very difficult.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty tricky though... I would like to keep a low profile so people can get into this before it&#39;s discredited somehow. But by spreading the info I am announcing to the suppressors as well. But there may be no way to avoid that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah like some type of synopsis. I was planning on that but it&#39;s just tricky. This info is so big that if you say it people just can&#39;t comprehend it.

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine if I was to say that I discovered who killed JFK... I don&#39;t have one piece of smoking gun physical proof... but if you were to look through a bunch of evidence that was factual you could piece together what actually happened.</p>

<p>And this info is scientific.... but the problem is I am not a scientist.</p>

<p>So someone would probably say - then how do you know you are right - in my case when I made all these discoveries the proof was all over that the ideas I had were right. I mean it was so overwhelming it&#39;s unbelievable.</p>

<p>But the problem is to really understand it you have to go through all the info.</p>

<p>I feel like I am decades ahead of the rest of society... that&#39;s why I wonder if its possible for people to understand this.  I had something that allowed me to see it where others couldn&#39;t though. Something happened to a family member of mine who I trust completely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do your utmost to keep your anonymity, but realise that some people you will confide in will not be trustworthy (cf. Bradley Manning) and could turn you in. </p>

<p>Make sure you divest yourself of everything you know to multiple third parties, and do what Snowden and Assange are reputed to have done - create a &quot;doomsday cache&quot; - to be publicly released in the event of anything untoward happening to you. </p>

<p>Finally, a &quot;would-be whistleblower&quot; is much more at risk of being taken out, than someone who has already spilled the beans. Do not discuss your plans, and certainly do not threaten/blackmail anyone - to do so is to put your life in serious danger. If you think your anonymity is compromised, you will be safer going public as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Edit: If you want to post anything &quot;substantive&quot;  on reddit, use a proxy (to hide you IP) and create a throwaway account.</p>

<p>You have to put to pen to paper and write a synopsis of your theory. It seems to me that you are procrastinating, and I think it&#39;s probably because you are worried that your ideas are going to be difficult to put on paper. But unless you do this, you will stuck in your current predicament for ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you see I have tried to get help from people. But as I said it takes a long long time to fully learn all this. It took me years but I went through many dead ends and a lot of disinfo and misinfo. </p>

<p>I have tried teaching a few different people along the way. Some people get caught up in the disinfo as well so they can never see the truth. This is by design though.</p>

<p>So now I am feeling like I should just release the info the best I can. Like right now for example I would like to make a website but I have things preventing me from doing this. Everything takes so much time to learn... it&#39;s all about time. Which is why I knew I needed help. Surviving in society right now is a full time job as it is.... let alone trying to navigate the issues I am on top of it all.</p>

<p>I thought I could get some help but that is what I described about this being too unbelievable for people to even consider taking seriously.

    <div class="md"><p>I have tried to explain this before...  but the only way you could completely prove elements of my discoveries is to get people to spend money to test them.</p>

<p>My doubt isn&#39;t in my discoveries. It&#39;s in my ability to explain how I discovered them. I am a person who is GREAT at researching things and taking in information but I am terrible at conveying it to others.</p>

<p>Now take that issue and then apply it to one of the most complex and difficult things to explain imaginable.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like the only thing I am good at is research. So to get this info out I need help. But finding someone to help is impossible because of the stigmas attached to these subjects.</p>

<p>But when you think about it it makes sense. Because all this info is out there. Others should have discovered this. The reason they haven&#39;t is because of those stigmas. Because everything in our society is completely controlled.</p>

<p>Also, they use media/information control as a method to prevent getting this info out properly.. as well as many other things.</p>

<p>There are amny other issues with this as well.. things that have to be dealt with WHEN I release this info. too.</p>

<p>For example what if I release the info and there is little interest because people think it sounds nuts. But some people see it and take the info and use it for their own purpose to get money. Then it may even look like I am copying them before I can get my info heard. And they may even change the info. The government themselves could and will probably do this.</p>

<p>It&#39;s issues like this that make this so impossible to deal with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These things, simultaneously, and as widely and compellingly as possible (where applicable):</p>

<p>id directly post online. I&#39;d also send in the &quot;letters to the editor&quot; forums, and also package the core neatlyas a press release and send to busy reporters near deadline time. (by widely k mean worldwide. Both translated and not would go to everyone.</p>

<p>of course safe deposit boxes widely, time capsule, and every web storage possible. Hard drives, mine and anyone who said yes. </p>

<p>then, disguised. One, as a game (apps on all platforms, and online too), as a scene by a guide to future history by a character I made in sl, as a computer virus (that does not damage, but randomly displays the in for one paragraph daily, once daily), in the fine print for anything I made, as a YouTube rant, a support thread, an IRC chat (with myself if need be), private notes on all forums, social nets, etc.</p>

<p>I would submit it as poetry, as contest entries, as fan mail to people. I&#39;d make.a quiz AP and the questions would have the info as answers. I&#39;d recite the core out loud with parrots present, id hire a private detective and five him the info as facts of why I wanted his services. I&#39;d set it up to lost in the future at every possible site, id send jt with no address thru the mails so it would languish. I&#39;d do the I fo as a prepared speech for toastmasters, write it as a play and send it to producers, do an concept album, recorded, by as many names as would do it, and release the album on soundcloud, last fm, etc. I&#39;d send it to the dumbest scandle blogs as an &quot;expose&quot; of their pet hate. I&#39;d submit it as testimony at any forum I could (courthouse, a fake lawsuit;). I&#39;d confess it, id request it from the DOJ under freedom of I fo act (as if it were controversial). I&#39;d prepare it as a damning secret of various candidates for office (counting on human laziness to skim and share, with keywords to hook them in bold...id paint it on my house walls, put jt on a series of mugs and send as gifts, make it a recording to be read jf jm dead as &quot;here&#39;s what the heirs get.&quot; id submit jt thru lobbyists, congress people, etc, in tedioz detail tbouar would go u read, id self public and pay to get it on record at the library of congress, ix bury it widely near shorelines everywhere, and plant false rumors of treasure. I&#39;d sell it for ten bucks as &quot;the secret to (name the desire). I&#39;d make it the text of a subliminal app, id male it the &quot;code&quot; for se supposed open source app and put it on github, id use it as a patent application, id have seone sue me for stealing it ..</p>

<p>basically id get jt on record, on devices, on tv, and sk on everywhere I possibly could. I&#39;d try too  get several groups of people hunting it, jd have It formally residing az government info (and try to make them guard ir without really reading it) and so on. Anywhere I could, any country, form, venue, and language. I&#39;d lay some savants to memorize it too.</p>

<p>again, simultaneous publication where its possible, and ongoing as I found new ways. I would be very vocal about many of the places it was, but the ones hard.to guess would never be mentioned. Ways to find those if needed would be in many places, disguised as something valuable of a &quot;bait&quot; nature and also as itself, kept by people of principle (obscure a d famous)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. So ongoing...but that&#39;s me. I tend to do things sometimes more completely than need be. I don&#39;t think tho it would take years to scan the info ito a machine, then generate portions as wanted, or share them, or send to storage? I didn&#39;t of course give details as I assume people can (if they wanted) think on the various thongs and how using a particular venue would a actually work (or if).

<p>Isn&#39;t that what done by court reporters during lengthy trials? Publishers of encyclopedias and mamoth fanasy series? People making games and movies also answered this as if I had all the money and access in the world. Why? To put forth as many ideas as possible. I guess I felt that was what was being sought, a way or ways to do it. O think of publishing because I was an editor, coding because my son codes, courtrooms because litigation and court drams abound, politicians and spiteful types who blog secrets, and so on because..</p>

<p>Human nature, reverse psychology, etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a longtime fan of activism,assange, occupy (lived at, got arrested at, etc) but I randomly saw the question and simply posted what arose. I generally take the view )until presented with details) that a question like &quot;what would you do?&quot; and  &quot;how do people..

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s true but keep in mind one way for them to prevent the info from spreading would be to spread disinfo. So let&#39;s say I put out a kind of bibliography.
