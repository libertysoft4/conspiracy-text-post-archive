<p><a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a022793skilling">http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a022793skilling</a></p>

<p>Funny though how that info has gradually disappeared from the internet</p>

<p>And before you ask, the differences between a 707 and 767...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The maximum takeoff weight for a Boeing 707-320B is 336,000 pounds.
The maximum takeoff weight for a Boeing 767-200ER is 395,000 pounds.</p>

<p>The wingspan of a Boeing 707 is 146 feet.
The wingspan of a Boeing 767 is 156 feet. </p>

<p>The length of a Boeing 707 is 153 feet.
The length of a Boeing 767 is 159 feet. </p>

<p>The Boeing 707 could carry 23,000 gallons of fuel.
The Boeing 767 could carry 23,980 gallons of fuel. </p>

<p>The cruise speed of a Boeing 707 is 607 mph = 890 ft/s,
The cruise speed of a Boeing 767 is 530 mph = 777 ft/s. </p>

<p>So, the Boeing 707 and 767 are very similar aircraft, with the main differences being that the 767 is slightly heavier and the 707 is faster. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>. A three-page white paper, dated February 3, 1964, described its findings: “The buildings have been investigated and found to be safe in an assumed collision with a large jet airliner (Boeing 707—DC 8) traveling at 600 miles per hour. Analysis indicates that such collision would result in only local damage which could not cause collapse or substantial damage to the building and would not endanger the lives and safety of occupants not in the immediate area of impact.” However, besides this paper, no documents are known detailing how this analysis was made.</p>

<p>The other structural engineer who designed the towers, Leslie Robertson, carried out a second study later in 1964, of how the towers would handle the impact of a 707 (see Between September 3, 2001 and September 7, 2001). However, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), following its three-year investigation into the WTC collapses, will in 2005 state that it has been “unable to locate any evidence to indicate consideration of the extent of impact-induced structural damage or the size of a fire that could be created by thousands of gallons of jet fuel.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we have one report done by numerous engineers where the data is not made fully available vs two reports done by single persons where the data and the methods are both unavailable. One was done by a team of engineers with the assistance of computers to run the analysis while the other was done during a time when computers were very rare and not very powerful at all.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s a case of which analysis do you trust? The one done by two separate single persons who did not disclose any of their methods or data or the one done by a team of people who provided their methods but not all of their raw data?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said, it&#39;s a choice. I&#39;m just pointing out that the fact that the papers by the WTC designers have the same shortcomings that the NIST report is criticized for.</p>

<p>NIST is criticized for not providing all of its data and methods. Neither of the papers provided by the designers of the Twin Towers provided their data or methods. Both are subject to the same criticism.</p>

<p>The NIST report is suspected of having a vested interest in proving that the plane crashes and fires caused the collapse. The designers of the Twin Towers would also have a vested interest in proving that their building could survive a plane crash. Both are subject to the same criticism.</p>

<p>Personally I&#39;m more inclined to go with the report that had more eyes on the calculations, having done numerous complex calculations and knowing that having a second (or third or fourth or fifteenth) set of eyes looking over the analysis is more likely to find flaws in the calculations. A single misplaced decimal point or incorrect sign on a single variable could completely change the outcome of the calculation.</p>

<p>In light of this, I don&#39;t consider the papers put out by the designers of the Twin Towers to be conclusive proof that a plane crash and subsequent fires are incapable of bringing down the buildings. Engineers are humans too and make mistakes like all people. However with no data or methods available regarding how the designers of the Twin Towers came to their conclusions we have no way of verifying the accuracy of their reports. This doesn&#39;t mean that they were <em>wrong</em>, but we have no way of verifying that they were <em>right</em>. As such, I can&#39;t take it as proof of anything other than that they said it wasn&#39;t possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Computer animations are also very elaborate virtual representations of reality. They can also make use of values that are not realistic and allow buildings to behave in any way they want, especially in ways that are just impossible to happen in reality.</p>

<p>NIST may have done good computer animations but untill the data or values that were used in those <em>simulations</em> is publicly available and confirmed to be within realistic possibilities (<em>aka respecting the laws of physics</em>) then those models are useless as corroboration. No scrutiny = no validity.</p>

<p>The fact that they have locked up the <strong>models&#39; data</strong> behind <strong>national security concerns</strong> (<em>data pertaining buildings that no longer exist and there are no others like it</em>) is already a big warning flag of a cover-up.</p>

<p>This is simply data that contains the values of fires and structure strength belonging to buildings that no longer exist. How on earth are those a danger to national security?

<p>The building structures were modelled in SAP2000 using a structural database created from the original building design drawings. Then the aircraft impact was modelled using LS-DYNA, utilising NIST created and publicly available material models. They used FDS to model the fires created and all assumptions and variables used in the simulation are in the report. Finally they analysed the structural failure using ANSYS structural analysis software, which used the model created in SAP2000 and incorporated the damage modelled in the aircraft impact and fire simulations.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t see where the missing information is? Everything you need to recreate the report is publicly available.</p>

<p>AE911 even obtained the structural design drawings for WTC7 via FIOA. Have they created their own building model using this? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I understand, the user created break elements used could be created using the figures found in the truss and knuckle capacity calculations anyway. Pg 53/54 of Report 1-6C even has the mathematical model used to create the break elements. </p>

<p>Obviously the problem here is you might come up with different assumptions and there is no way of checking.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say that creating a model and simulating the collapse, or lack thereof would be the logical first step. Then they&#39;d either need to release the data for comparison or it would give a large boost to your credibility. </p>

<p>The most likely reason to me about why they&#39;ve been withheld is that you could maybe transfer them to the analysis of another structure and find an easy way to bring a building down. Who knows though.</p>

<p>As you can see from the citations on those reports, there were a hell of a lot of people involved in the analysis who would have had intimate knowledge of this data. Why would they keep quiet?</p>
