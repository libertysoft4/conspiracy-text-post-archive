    <div class="md"><p>Vote brigading, in theory, is organizing offsite or onsite to effect the votes of other content. For many years, this rule was enforced by the admins if you made posts such as &quot;Help me out here!&quot; or &quot;Support needed!&quot; when crossposting.</p>

<p>Recently, this has changed a bit; and simply following a link to another subreddit and engaging in voting can cause your account to be subject to a shadowban. Because of this, we recommend using redditlog or the np domain when crossposting. </p>

<p>The reason why there is controversy surrounding the enforcement of this rule is two fold;</p>

<p>Firstly, subs like bestof routinely vote briagde but the admins let it slide because it helps the site.</p>

<p>Secondly groups like srs/sa (srs= somethingawful goons for the most part) are allowed to brigade to &quot;control content&quot; as a reward for their help during project panda (if you wonder why the predditors tumblr was allowed to spread for 18 hours on reddit, it was because the admins wanted VA, PIMA and the creepshots founder gone, and they used the goons to do it). So that pisses people off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was an ugly situation.</p>

<p>PIMA was a reddit inc insider who turned on the Brooklyn mod cabals and leaked sensitive information tieing Alexis to the default mods IRL.</p>

<p>VA used to mod <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a> and <a href="/r/wtf">/r/wtf</a> among other defaults, until he <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ptsny/dear_internet_vigilantes_and_lynch_mobs/c3sc3dq">resigned</a> after watching masta take payola to turn <a href="http://imgur.com/a/S08Jt">this thread exposing what Chris Brown really did to his girlfriend</a> into <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ps8j6/here_is_the_police_report_with_the_details_of/">this barren wasteland</a>. </p>

<p>Both PIMA and VA were targeted in what was called project panda.</p>

<p>Project panda started with the SA goons creating a subreddit called <a href="/r/preteengirls">/r/preteengirls</a>. Then they filled that sub with CP and emailed Andersoon Cooper (about their own sub). Cooper was then directed by the goons to <a href="/r/jailbait">/r/jailbait</a> and <a href="/r/creepshots">/r/creepshots</a>, which he ran a story on.</p>

<p>Right after that story ran, a document started spreading around on reddit called the predditors tumblr. This tumblr doxxed VA, the creepshots founder and PIMA (although PIMA was only involved in creepshots because davack asked him to quell the flow of cp that was being raided there by the goons, also part of project panda).</p>

<p>This tumblr was what eventually got into the slimy hands of a gawker media reporter; who used it to get VA fired. His piece also lead to death threats against the creepshots founder. IN response, mods of all major subreddits permanently banned gawker from reddit (against the wishes of the admins).</p>

<p><a href="http://pastebin.com/R2gYZq32">Here&#39;s the mod chat where the mod revolted aginst the admins in response to the shady shit that went down over that 18 day period from when /r/preteengirls was created by the goons to when VA and others were doxxed.</a>.</p>

<p>The intention of all of this was such that reddit inc could throw its hands up in the face of a &quot;free speech problem&quot; and say &quot;We didn&#39;t remove anything, we simply bowed to internal pressure and instituted community standards.&quot; And now you know why srd called that incident doxxtober. </p>

<p>*Oh also, srs gets hands off treatment from the admins as a thank you for that incident. </p>

<p>**Also, let me make myself clear; I do not think jailbait and creepshots, while legal, were appropriate communities for this site. But that said, they way in which the admins chose to get rid of them (using doxxing) was fucked and wrong. </p>

<p>from Sporkicide[A] via <a href="/r/reddit.com/">/r/reddit.com/</a> sent 6 days ago</p>

<p>That post actually had nothing to do with the ban. You and hundreds of other users followed a link from <a href="/r/conspiracy/">/r/conspiracy/</a> into <a href="/r/Needamod/">/r/Needamod/</a> and you all voted/commented on what was linked. This sort of activity is considered a type of vote manipulation, and is against the site rules. If you can promise not to engage in this type of behavior in the future, I&#39;m happy to unban you.</p>

<p>User id strings are hex offsets, so it&#39;s possible you got caught up by accident; although what&#39;s more likely is that you commented in the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> post so the admin dolling out the bans threw you in. Either way, that&#39;s fucked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting; only once in the history of reddit have I seen the admins pull out user id strings to justify a ban, so you will probably never find out the answer sadly. To that end, I think they avoid using user id strings to justify bans for 2 reasons; </p>

<p>Firstly, it takes a good amount of time to translate the code into english that an end user would understand.</p>

<p>Secondly, in a situation when they are saying &quot;hundereds of users from one sub went into another&quot;; in order to back that up they&#39;d have to release the user id strings for all parties involved and that&#39;s territory they do not want to go into one bit, imo. </p>

<p>As an aside; I think the admins probably have a fascinating picture of reddit that they can&#39;t talk about. Because what they can do is easily chart people&#39;s alts and what not, so they know every network of power users and how they operate but they can&#39;t say a word about it publicly (most of the time; see Ian Chong and Saydrah as two big examples). </p>

<p>Eff&#39;s privacy badger also does that plus more privacy good stuff, I believe, but you may want to double check the specifics of it&#39;s effects.</p>

<p>(I figured it&#39;s worth linking because you can likely trust an EFF plugin to not fuck you over)</p>

<p>Available here.</p>

<p>Note: this won&#39;t make a jot of difference to your behaviour on reddit. They obviously have all your stuff logged there, but it may protect you from shadowbans after following an off-site link.</p>

<p>fwiw Brigading is pretty shitty IMO, but it&#39;s very true that enforcement is selective here and it&#39;s almost second nature to follow a bestof post and upvote good content. Try and avoid engaging in links where your response is negative - particularly if it is a dated post.</p>

<p>Disclaimer - somebody probably understands this stuff far better than me, and you should wait for them to clarify or dispute this advice before following it.</p>

<p>Vote Brigades are against the rules, they are seen as a cheap way to keep certain content down and spam the hot with pointless things that are unrelated.</p>

<p>Certain subs do it to so stop content that they disagree with from reaching &quot;hot&quot;. Usually they would be about the following (Israel, Anti Obama, Monsanto, GMOs Chemtrails and other stuff)</p>
