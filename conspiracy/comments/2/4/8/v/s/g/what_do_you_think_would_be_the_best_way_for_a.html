    <div class="md"><p>How about an interterrestial alien species, say one that has been directing our physical evolution for hundreds of thousands of years? </p>

<p>Something in our bodies that doesn&#39;t quite play by the same rules as everything else... maybe has a different copy of the playbook...  one that ensures its dominance by destroying any and all competition.... one that controls how our cells generate energy.... </p>

<p>It&#39;d probably reveal itself in every way possible, and still no one would believe it.  You&#39;d probably get a history of different manifestations of it revealing itself throughout the history of mankind... each a little different... but each mostly the same. </p>

<p>While I understand the futility of Utopia, every now and again it&#39;s healing to let go and consider What If...</p>

<p>Some former, (now ghosts?) frequent posters in here have admonished and encouraged me to remember humor, curiosity, discovery, perhaps fantasy, if you will!</p>

<p>Others <em>in here</em> explore media in all facets, be they <em>NEWS</em> or  HOllyWOOD sources and I just cannot swallow that pill! I&#39;m hard pressed to make it through my daily reality!</p>

<p>My silly Utopia would, by edict, probably see my shoes, my britches and jacket crumpled at the feet of my supervisors desk, because I despise his bigotry, hatred, ignorance so deeply, that I count days that I never have to see his face nor hear his voice. </p>

<p>He&#39;s a person that I loathe. Deeply.</p>

<p>Simply having exhausted every avenue to not have this person be a part of my work environment, I&#39;ve had to resort to some mind numbing acrobatics. </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t pleasant. Do I want him dead. No. I just want him to not be there.</p>

<p>I shudder to think</p>

<p>What it would mean</p>

<p>If the president wore pink</p>

<p>What would happen then</p>

<p>How would the world change</p>

<p>If thick became thin</p>

<p>And the world was rearranged</p>

<p>If the rains brought down the moon</p>

<p>And daylight was feared</p>

<p>If dogs became kings</p>

<p>And the Pope chewed gum</p>

<p>And hobos had wings</p>

<p>And God was a bum</p>

<p>If houses became trees</p>

<p>And flowers turned to stone</p>

<p>And there were no families</p>

<p>And people lived alone</p>

<p>If buildings started laughing</p>

<p>And windows cried</p>

<p>And feet started clapping</p>

<p>And out came inside</p>

<p>If mountains fell in slivers</p>

<p>And the sky began to bleed</p>

<p>And blood filled up the rivers</p>

<p>And prisoners were freed</p>

<p>If the stars fell apart</p>

<p>And the ocean dried up</p>

<p>And the world was one big heart</p>

<p>And decided to stop</p>

<p>If children grew up happier</p>

<p>And they could run with the wolves</p>

<p>And they never felt trapped</p>

<p>Or hungry or unloved</p>

<p>If cats walked on water</p>

<p>And we loved one another</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you see &quot;The World&#39;s End&quot; (the Simon Pegg movie ostensibly about bar-hopping, but actually about an alien race coming to earth)? Worth a watch if you haven&#39;t. I had trouble enjoying it because of all of the under/overtones. </p>

<p>I think mass media is a more likely option than crop circles, see also how the government seeds political stuff (like the healthcare law, and everyone on pretty much every 9pm show being an FBI agent) in modern TV shows. Would make sense for an alien race to follow the blueprint as it&#39;s proven to be effective.</p>

<p>Honestly I think they would avoid the mainstream media completely because they&#39;d know how controlled and censored it is. What are they gonna do, request an interview with Bill O&#39;Reilly? Lol that would be make a pretty bad first impression.</p>

<p>I think they would bypass the media completely and go for something more creative, like communicating via crop circles, or through some sort of publicity stunt on the internet, or through film like I mentioned.</p>
