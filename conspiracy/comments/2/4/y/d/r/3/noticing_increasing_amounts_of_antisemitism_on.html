    <div class="md"><p>Wasn&#39;t Lebensraum about giving a certain set of people a place to live, only it entailed removal of the current people who lived there? It seems as though Zionism differs only in method. How you place &#39;commie&#39; with these two I don&#39;t understand.</p>

<p>Judaism <strong>should</strong> have a homeland, as history has shown that their culture is unsafe from attack. That homeland has come at the detriment of others due to their insistence on religious grounds of it being located in a certain place. Fine, it&#39;s a done deal. However, to continue to expand by driving off the local populace, at least without just compensation, is wrong, and I firmly believe that saying so is not racist.</p>

<p>as a counterpoint to your argument, I don&#39;t consider myself antisemitic at all.  I have no problem whatsoever with Jewish people.  However I don&#39;t support Zionism, and I feel that as you put it &quot;just giving people a home&quot; is a very evil thing when you do it by killing, torturing, persecuting and displacing the people who already live there.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t think I am &quot;slinging mud&quot; all over your post though.  Seems your last statement is &quot;please agree with me here, if you don&#39;t gtfo&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certain groups get insulted in this sub all the time, people mock Christianity all the time. People have been indoctrinated that any criticisms of Jews is antisemitism. Also people see what Israel does to the Palestinians, for example, then those Jewish people are just being protected by &#39;Murica. I think you view people criticizing the Jewish elite as a hatred for all the Jewish people. We criticize America&#39;s elite, but it is not a criticism to the masses.</p>

<p>For the small amount of % of Jewish people they do take contain a higher percentage of influence in certain things like Hollywood. Also there might be some validity about discussing the Ashkenazian Jews (European Jews) are the ones that control Hollywood or people like Ben Bernaki being one. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone should hate jews, blacks, or whatever race because of race or culture, but I don&#39;t think a criticism to certain aspects of jewish influence makes it antisemitism. </p>

<p>Yes but do they claim Christians infiltrate and destroy society, control the government and media, steal our money and manipulate our political process? All while tied in with some racist notion that Christians aren&#39;t white?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well let&#39;s look at who runs the world finances, the Rothschilds, who claim to be Jewish. What is our current economic model of the world, to keep the masses struggling and an upper elite to dominate the world&#39;s finances. If money controls our politics, then yes the Rothschilds, Jews, are manipulating our political process. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think people have something against the average person who happens to be Jewish. It just happens that there is a significant influence from people who are Jews in today&#39;s society.</p>

<p>To ignore jewish influence on today&#39;s society is ignorant of you. The common joke amond comedians is don&#39;t make fun of the Jews or they will never work in Hollywood again. It is a joke, but there is some truth that the there is some truth. It comes down to sources people trust, like modern day jews being Ashkenazi Jews, or Khazars, so it may not be a real criticism against actual jews like the ones who should be in Israel or the Ashkenazi Jews who do occupy Israel and influence in today&#39;s society.</p>

<p>It is just a different perspective and I am not disputing that there are some people who are just racist, but I don&#39;t believe that is the case for most.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The USA and Israel pact has probably more to do with the negative view. There is a jewish influence in USA and around the world. Rothschilds have a tremendous influence in the money supply around the world. </p>

<p>If you believe it is just our government ruining America then yes, you should criticize the people in the government like the Irish descent you say. I believe that places like the federal reserve have more influence, who has had half of their presidents be jewish. I believe the people who are running the world are ones who claim to be Jewish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a few people here that are actually probably racists and I don&#39;t agree with it but you can&#39;t say if a Jewish person or a group of Jewish people does something wrong then it can&#39;t be discussed. It&#39;d be like saying that you can&#39;t criticise Muslims because a lot were slaughtered in the crusades, you can criticise a black man because of slavery and you can&#39;t say anything bad about Jews because of the Holocaust. Everyone is on an equal footing in my eyes and that means everyone is open to criticism regardless of historical horrors. I&#39;m also open to free speech and don&#39;t want to see this sub turn like the others where domains are banned because a group of people don&#39;t like it. That leads to the levels of discussion being narrowed so it doesn&#39;t even exist.</p>

<p>The down vote button is there for a reason and if you spot people being abusive or racist, report it to the mods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem and I don&#39;t really disagree with your comment that there is a little more racism here (from certain users) but it&#39;s a very small but vocal minority. People try and use that to accuse the whole sub of being racists. I&#39;ve been here for over three years under different accounts and I&#39;ve honestly seen less than ten bonafide racists that regularly post racist material. Then there&#39;s people that come here and post racist material for ulterior motives and that is to make the racism look worse than it is. That person (in one instance) was a moderator of several large sub-reddits.</p>

<p>There&#39;s racists here but there&#39;s also an effort by groups of people to make it worse. This sub is one of the most open in terms of allowed discussions and it should stay that way. Just down vote actual racism and call them out if you feel you should.</p>

<p>Racism of any sort is abhorrent. Worse, especially for people who fancy themselves &quot;free-thinkers&quot;, its presence in a person renders them much more controllable. Not as much as being fanatically religious, but more than not being artificially predisposed to it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not racist; <em>I have a black friend!</em></p>

<p>Here&#39;s how the Jewish virtual library (<a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Zionism/zionism.html">http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Zionism/zionism.html</a>) defines Zionism:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The term “Zionism” was coined in 1890 by Nathan Birnbaum.</p>

<p>Its general definition means the national movement for the return of the Jewish people to their homeland and the resumption of Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By that definition, it would seem like anyone of any religion or race could potentially agree with Zionism. Anyone who agrees the Jewish people (be it race or religion, I guess) should have sovereignty over Israel is a Zionist. Not all squares are rectangles, in this case.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not how the terms Zionism or Zionist are used in this sub.</p>

<p>What other group of people have a &quot;right&quot; to land <em>some</em> of their ancestors supposedly lived in thousands of years ago?

<p>I think you&#39;re confused about what racism is.</p>

<p>It&#39;s treating people differently - anything from &quot;labels&quot; to violence - because of their race.</p>

<p>I never did any such thing. You did.</p>

<p>Congrats on using the typical first denial though - projecting your own racism upon someone who suggests it&#39;s there.</p>

I didn&#39;t even factor that into my thinking of them as a person.  This is a witch hunt.  You did bring race into it. The thread was about race. I denied being anti Semitic and racist because I am not racists. Sure I note that my friend mike is black.  The same way I note my friend Scott is tall.  It&#39;s physical characteristics that you can&#39;t deny you notice.  But I do not treat or view anybody differently because of race or religion.

<p>Have you ever read or listened to Hitler&#39;s speeches?</p>

<p>The idea behind Nazism was to establish a &quot;fatherland&quot; for Aryan peoples.</p>

<p>These issues are far more complex than Nazi bad Zionist good.</p>

<p>Americans are both bad and good.  Israelis are both bad and good.  The Nazis were both bad and good.  There is no universal goodness no universal truth.  Perspective can change the color of the sky and size of the moon.  Our minds are feeble and we often can&#39;t wrap our heads around simple concepts.  </p>

<p>Why is it acceptable to blame the white man because he is white and in the majority but not okay to blame the Jewish guy?  Why is it okay to fight for same sex marriage but disgusting to fight for polygamy?  Why is it okay to consider race when hiring someone if they are a minority but bad to consider it if they are in the majority?  Why is it ignored and often up voted in <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a>, <a href="/r/wtf">/r/wtf</a>, <a href="/r/askreddit">/r/askreddit</a> etc etc when someone types something racist or offensive but in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> it is somehow proof that all 250,000 of us are huge racists?</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Perspective is a motherfucker.</p>

<p>Every day some genius comes along in mod mail here and moans bitches and complains about some offensive content.  They want us to remove it or ban the OP or censor the topic.</p>

<p>I&#39;m over it man.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Derisive slurs against people&#39;s race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, social order or creed are not tolerated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is how the rule reads, it doesn&#39;t say that offensive comments or posts will be removed.  It doesn&#39;t say that racists domains will be banned or that racists users aren&#39;t allowed.  If the OP can follow the rules then its allowed.  Nobody is forcing you to click the link.</p>

<p>You&#39;re giving the impression that you only enforce rules against people that disagree with you, but if someone breaks the rules by being as bigoted as you are, you do nothing.

<p>This is absurd guidance to give as a moderator.  You have to know that.  People come to this subreddit to discuss people abusing power, and they run into moderators that scour other subreddits banning people for what they say elsewhere on reddit, and only enforcing rules against people they personally disagree with.
