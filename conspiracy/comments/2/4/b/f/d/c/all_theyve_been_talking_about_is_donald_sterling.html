    <div class="md"><p>Or rather, what are they conditioning the masses for?  </p>

<p>I have a question.  How many posts do you see on Reddit that take the other side of the Sterling argument?  Answer?  Zero.  Try to find one.  In fact, I have personally tried multiple times, in multiple subreddits to start a discussion on the notion that Sterling is getting railroaded.  <strong>Every one</strong> got removed after about 5 minutes.  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/24b2im/why_are_only_antisterling_posts_allowed_on_here/">Here</a> is a link to my final try, you can see a discussion actually started before it was abruptly taken down by mods.</p>

<p>Clearly powerful people, through the media (Reddit included), only want the public to see one side of this.  They want the pitchforks to be out, and want to bring this &quot;restriction of speech&quot; to become normal.  Remember- this guy was secretly recorded in <em>his own home</em> (which is inherently sort of Orwellian).  The public overwhelmingly accepts punishing Sterling, regardless of how the evidence was obtained.  That&#39;s fucking crazy, and infuriating!  </p>

<p>And where does this go from here- especially given the technology capabilities of the Government/the NSA/people in power?  Will they eventually pass laws down the line that allow data obtained by covert surveillance to be proactivly (not a word?  I&#39;m using it anyway) used against people?  And the public will get behind it, because they have been ushered into the thinking by this?  If they can get people this enraged about merely something trivial like this old man not wanting his girlfriend to be seen in public with a black guy, imagine the next guy who drops the N-bomb?  I can see the masses now, falling all over themselves to give up more of our freedoms for fear of being called a &quot;racist.&quot;</p>

<p>No, I don&#39;t like where this is going at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets put this in perspective: </p>

<p>V Stiviano was associated with the LA Dodgers the year Magic wanted to buy them. Magic shows interest in Clippers. Sterling shuts him down. Then the Sterling Stiviano incident happens. </p>

<p>Coincidence?</p>

<p>What about Spike Lee. Notorious anti-white racists has made literally the same comments about his sugar mommas not being in pictures with white people.</p>

<p>Ever heard of Five Percent Nation? A movement where blacks view themselves as Gods and the Chosen ones while White are the devils. Who is apart of this cult? Jay-Z, other NBA stars such as Carmelo. </p>

<p>As Cuban said, the problem was the mess that Sterling made which lead to the 29/29 votes. Any owner who didn&#39;t unanimously vote would get slaughtered by the media. It has come to the fact that a conversation in private can be used to destroy and defame any individual. This is blackmail. All the owners know it. Scenario: Wealthy owner of one of the hottest markets and teams in the NBA. First year of a new commissioner. Sterling is known as a bigot and racist. NBA is a black dominant league. It was a long con in the planning. </p>

<p>What Sterling said was wrong but I am pretty sure everyone single one of us has made a &quot;racist&quot; comment in private. Forcing to sell the Clippers is wrong. This is the start of a long long ugly legal battle. </p>

<p>We are on the verge of the biggest race war we will witness. The Trayvon/Sterling recent media controversies is the beginning. Racists have been waiting a lonnnng time for this. Each major racist headline is moving up the chain into a bigger and bigger story. The irony is that each headline is a &quot;white&quot; (except George Zimmerman who was reported White initially&quot; vs a black man. What was the Trayvon Martin Zimmerman case? an overblown case that happens everyday. Where are the headlines where whites, asians, indians, and muslims are being tormented from racism from a black/latino? Fuck the media and their damn racism propaganda. Another distraction story to distract Americans from the Cold War we are in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m (pretty sure) i was watching daily show the other day and he was going on about sterling. i think he showed a clip of a news team in which one of the &quot;reporters&quot; (an older white man on the far left) claimed that sterling had told his girlfriend to record what he says because he has a bad memory. if one news team is saying it i&#39;m sure others are as well, so i&#39;m gonna guess that that&#39;s where people are getting it. edit: just sayin..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like I have to correct this every time I see it, so don&#39;t take this personally or as an attack--we have to start paying attention and stop flippantly saying &quot;NSA&quot; and filing the issue away every time there&#39;s a cyber anything or personal information siphoning. NSA isn&#39;t the only intelligence agency or corporate entity out there collecting people&#39;s data. But no one&#39;s asking about what the others are doing, and what they&#39;re doing with it. In fact, it&#39;s eminently possible that the NSA was thrown on the bus to take our eyes off the corruption ball. Look at the timing of the Snowden revelations for clues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Climate Change report came out with very distressing news. It was almost completely ignored by the major TV news media.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really understand this idea that every story is designed to distract you from some other story, but I guess that could be it. Big business doesn&#39;t want you thinking about the damage being done to the earth and the repercussions. We are, after all, a consumption driven economy.</p>

<p>People could easily just quit playing for the clippers or stop going to the games to line the guys pockets, but no...... we can&#39;t really take a stand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a reaction to our overall deep seated racism. We are racist, all of us, because anyone with eyes can see it. Unfortunately we have used our eyes for a very long time to good effect, thus we tend to take things at face value. Race for all intents and purposes are patterns that we recognize. We all have different interpretation of those patterns but they&#39;re there and pretending they&#39;re not there isn&#39;t going to make them go away, it just creates a reactionary denial of said perception. </p>

<p>It&#39;s why this is getting so much attention, race is still and always will be an issue, it is perceptibly obvious on every sense. The issue is glorified not so much because of it&#39;s negativity, but rather as an extraordinary denial of the fact. The extreme denial of it is the actual negative emotion we feel as a result of exposing our own inherent racism.</p>
