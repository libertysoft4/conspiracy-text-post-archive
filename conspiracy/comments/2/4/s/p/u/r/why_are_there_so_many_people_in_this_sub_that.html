You mean <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>[1] , <a href="/r/zog">/r/zog</a>[2] and <a href="/r/whiterights">/r/whiterights</a>[3] ?
I do see the crossover.
Personally I find it hard to take the opinion of a doxxing guy who got shadowbanned who made a stalker sub that was SUPER sad that only you used, who spends all his waking moment talking about conspiratard seriously.
This is a sub for making fun of theorists. But you personally see thgis as a place where we just love and defend Jews, right?
The thing is, if you were able to recognise anti-semitism and say &quot;This is anti-semitic&quot; whenever a literal holocaust denier posts, then we wouldn&#39;t have a leg to stand on when we say &quot;those guys REALLY tolerate anti-semites, don&#39;t they?&quot;
Instead you focus on how the other side uses the word &quot;anti-semite&quot; as if that&#39;s relevant.
Honestly it baffles me you wander outside <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>[4] considering you believe everything they tell you to 100%. What&#39;s the point?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, no. That&#39;s not quite how it works. The vast of majority of shill accusations are simply removed, regardless of who posts them. Occasionally, I&#39;ll issue a warning. Given the nature of this post, I decided a warning would be best, primarily to clarify why we have this rule to other users.</p>

<p>And as I mentioned prior, one is still free to discuss the existence of shills openly, programs such as JTRIG or JIDF tactics, or even perhaps call out other users as alleged shills who had posted in another sub. If you, on the other hand, decide to levy such an accusation against another user here in this sub, as the phrase is often over used and used without justification, and as we have a rule against doing so for that very reason, the comment will simply be removed in most instances. And again, a polite warning may be issued if one user is harassing another in the process, if the a user makes these accusations excessively and without justification, or in other rare instances wherein a mod considers it necessary to clarify their position in enforcing said rule, so that the users here are more aware of the reasoning behind it. </p>

<p>Some people here (not everyone) are concerned about vaccines based on evidence or research they have read which stated vaccines are potentially more harmful than helpful. It&#39;s more out of a sense of caution and debate than organized juvenile ridicule. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part I, this is my own research, you can self verify my sources if you want and see if any of these dots line up for yourself. Its also important to note that Vaccinations do kill children, its right there in the vaccination funds own stats <a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/statisticsreports.html">http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/statisticsreports.html</a>, so for every life it &quot;saves&quot; how many will be killed and how many will suffer your fate, a fate it was supposedly manufactured to prevent. That is not to say that vaccinations are not without their uses, but as the industry is now, well, you&#39;ll know if you read it out and check the sources for yourself, and form an informed opinion for yourself, you&#39;ll know that our consent on this issue is totally manufactured, as in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent">manufactured consent</a>. </p>

<p>Most people get their information on vaccination from propaganda from corporate, government subsidized mainstream media sites, you&#39;ve been lied to pretty hard and here&#39;s why, I&#39;ll try to explain it as expediently as I can, and there&#39;s a tons of info on vaccination production which I don&#39;t think you or anyone else outside of this subreddit, is fully aware off, to the excruciating detriment of us all. </p>

<p>Did you know, that the U.S. created <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court">Vaccinations Courts</a>, and a <a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/statisticsreports.html">Vaccination Fund</a> which can easily deflect lawsuits aimed at the Big Five Pharmaceutical Corporations. Not only that, in this government created, <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/01/sebelius-supported-by-figure-tied-to-fundraising-scandal/">corporate influenced court</a>, the United States Department of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services">Health and Human Services or HHS</a> for short can decide, a government apparatus, can decide what the cause of harm is to your person, instead of a normal court of law. This all flies in the face of the fact that the rates of Autism have exploded since <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html">2000 where 1 in 150 U.S. children had autism to now there being 1 in 68 children with Autism as off 2013</a>. In Canada for boys its worse!, <a href="http://www.autismspeaks.ca/about-autism/facts-and-stats/">1 in 42 boys will contract Autism this year, though for girls 1 in 189 will develop Autism as of 2014</a>!</p>

<p>There have been already cases which have obviously shown, by lawyers and doctors of victims that vaccination induced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy">encephalopathy (brain disease)</a> lead directly to Autism. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/post2468343_b_2468343.html">Not only has this been clearly shown in a court of law</a>, where HHS, a government body openly decided against damning evidence of medical professionals which clearly showed the direct link between vaccination and autism. They have repeatedly in every case said that vaccination do not cause Autism, only in this corporate judicial system is this nightmare possible.</p>

<p>What motivation does big pharmaceutical have for making shoddy drugs and selling it to the public? <a href="http://vactruth.com/2012/11/30/2011-billions-vaccine-manufacturers">Merck alone earns more then 1.5 billion dollars from child vaccinations, the other four each receive over a billion from the government</a>. Not only are they shielded by the vaccination courts, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/post2468343_b_2468343.html">the government also shields and buries cases which clearly have seen a direct causal link between vaccinations and Autism</a>. </p>

<p>People love to say stupid uninformed things like, vaccinations are solid science, or why would scientists and doctors kill us with totally defective pharmaceutical products? Vaccine drugs not even effective in preventing outbreaks, but are the actual sources of current day outbreaks themselves. Fact, vaccinations last only a few years, actual viral infection and normal body white cell response creates a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twch-T-n8Ns&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">life time of immunity from the virus itself</a>. Fact, most doctors receive <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/topics/health-concerns/vaccines/do-doctors-have-financial-incentive-get-their-patients-fully-vaccinated">financial incentives</a> from big pharmaceuticals to immunize your children with a full bombardment of drugs(vaccinations), often at birth or in the first critical months of their lives. Some people for some reason think Doctors and Scientists are morally superior beings, that is one of the greatest perceptual fallacies in North America. These people operate with the naive and blind trust of the public when in fact they&#39;re just human beings out to make a quick buck. Do these people care enough to actually research vaccination development? Probably not, arm chair citizen researchers know more about it then doctors because they&#39;ve actually done the research themselves. It should be obviously noted that doctors are not gods, the medical sphere is massive, specialization takes years in one specific study. Their knowledge and understanding of other medical fields is particularly acute and limited, it&#39;s not such a stupid idea that an internet researcher could know far more about drug vaccinations then a medical family physician, lest we forget <a href="http://tenpennyimc.com/2011/12/24/why-do-doctors-push-vaccines/">these people are financially incentivized to pump you and your kids full of drugs</a>. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the other kicker, vaccination production, vaccinations aren&#39;t made in just chicken eggs, they&#39;ve made from cows and monkeys as well. So what, farm animals, what&#39;s the problem there? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeMYl_UH8Mo">Bayer made a batch of vaccinations from HIV infected monkey&#39;s and sold it in the North American market, when it was discovered the FDA and the U.S. federal government allowed Bayer to sell the HIV laden drugs to other countries, countries in Europe, Asia and in Aids ridden Africa so that they could turn a back a profit on it. Why did they use HIV monkeys? because these African monkeys where cheaper to purchase then monkeys from other countries. Not only that not one person in Bayer was held legally responsible for this in the United States, yet in every other country they sold it in, their executives where hunted in the individual countries judicial system.</a> Here&#39;s the other problem, we cannot filter out the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1m3TjokVU4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">dna of these animals from which we create vaccinations, this means viral contaminates like HIV, madcow(prions), antibiotic super viruses can spread from animal</a> to vaccine to human. </p>

<p>Side note on antibiotic super viruses/bacteria: Pigs, chickens and cows are all given hormone boosters to quicken the development of muscle mass and milk production. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6oq7X5G2f0">Bovine growth hormone</a> has already been shown to be dangerous to humans who even eat or drink cow byproduct of any kind as the U.S. is the only G7 member to allow it for commercial use in the development of food product. Animals are also given huge amounts of antibiotics to keep them healthy in super <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_animal_farming">crowded, massive animal farms</a>,  like a gaint petri dish where if even one animal with a sickness develops <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2012/07/antibiotic-use-vaccines-factory-farms-creating-new-pathogens">antibiotic resistance</a>, it spreads quite a bit the group. Some of these animals are diverted and sold to vaccination development. The other fun fact is that <a href="http://healthvermont.gov/prevent/salmonella/salmonella.aspx">eggs are one of the primary carriers of salmonella food poisoning</a>, again since <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1m3TjokVU4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">vaccine developers have admitted to being unable to remove viruses or bacteria</a>, this crap can still get into pharmaceutical drugs. </p>

<p>This concludes Part I</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m afraid berries and drugs are not the same thing, one is heavily manufactured, in such that the scientists who do produce the drugs always notify the corporate end of any, undesirable effects. In every single case of litigation faulty drugs were sold with the full understanding of their defects, which were intentionally hidden, and that they could easily cause significant damage to the consumer. With a vaccination court and a vaccine fund, there is virtually no incentive for them not to release cheap and defective garbage into the market, these pharmaceutical CEOs are all chronic and greedy psychopathic liars, this is a risk that is being planted against us by the corrupt government with intentional malice and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent">manufactured consent</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is known that complications can happen, because of genetic diversity some people will have allergic reactions.  Of course, encepalopathy is very serious.  </p>

<p>However the statistics you posted showed that out of 1,968,399,297 doses, there were 1,300 compensable cases between 2006-2012.  That&#39;s less than 1 in a million.</p>

<p>So even given that such complications can happen, <em>it&#39;s still better</em> to vaccinate than to not vaccination.  Because the alternative is many more deaths or damages during outbreaks.</p>

<p>It is known that complications can happen, because of genetic diversity some people will have allergic reactions. Of course, encepalopathy is very serious.</p>

<p>However the statistics you posted showed that out of 1,968,399,297 doses, there were 1,300 compensable cases between 2006-2012. That&#39;s less than 1 in a million.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true, while only <a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/statisticsreports.html">1/4 of the cases before the vaccination fund were given compensation</a>, this does not account for the vaccination court, or the fact that people and their doctors are brainwashed against the association of vaccination to injury of their persons. The number of actual claimants given the extremely obvious, manufactured consent of the public could easily be in the millions. </p>

<p>The other thing that I was pointing out was that vaccination is not the cure all that people like to think it is, as exampled by Polio during its endemic period was treated heavily with the usage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDT">DDT</a>, it was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yagO9jngMWk">literally sprayed on every single thing imaginable</a>, this garbage is a known neural toxin, just like regular pesticides people spray currently on their front lawns in cities that&#39;ve yet to ban it. DDT also caused symptoms of Polio, which is unsurprising as both cause brain damage, also to note only one strain of polio is lethal, as it damages the brain stem. The other thing is that people with healthy diets, such as a <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/real-food/sugar-facts-myths-zmaz71sozgoe.aspx#axzz30zLmrF5X">no sugar</a> diet had extremely low infection rates, around and below 6% as shown here from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twch-T-n8Ns&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">30min-37min mark</a>, which compared to the 60% infection rates of sugar eaters is quite remarkable. Sugar is <a href="http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/health-effects-of-sugar">extremely detrimental to your overall health, white, brown, its all heavily processed sucrose, so that tidbit about it being an enabler of infection doesn&#39;t come as much of a surprise now...</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So even given that such complications can happen, it&#39;s still better to vaccinate than to not vaccination. Because the alternative is many more deaths or damages during outbreaks.</p>

<p>Who do you sue if you or your child get sick from contracting an illness from someone who didn&#39;t vaccinate themselves or their children?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Guess you&#39;re still not seeing the obvious, vaccinations while useful are not as necessary as you or the government&#39;s corporate, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent">manufactured consent</a> leads on. Outbreaks in polio and other viruses where brought on by poor sanitation, DDT(chemical insecticide based on Agent Orange), poor diets(sugar and processed foods). Same thing today as well, except the government can actually, and effectively contain and stop lethal outbreaks, such as SARs without a vaccine. All kids need are the basic one timer vaccines, measles, rubella, but even there I&#39;ve yet to adequately if at all research those, also doctors here informed me that the hepatitis shots are rather pointless unless you plan to travel to a brick nation or a third world country, along with this is the $1000 hepatitis C cure pill, sure not so cheap presently, but hopefully conveniently affordable in a few years. The point is that all this extra crap is unnecessary, flu shots aren&#39;t necessary, its total B.S. all you need is a system that keeps sick nurses and doctors out of the system when their ill, same for responsible employers, but this country does not value the well being of the individual or the employee, also it doesn&#39;t help the fact that<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/opinion/the-doctor-is-sick-he-will-see-you-now.html?_r=0">doctors are notorious for working while ill and being plague carriers themselves</a>.</p>

<p>The final and massively colossal problem is Autism, 1 in 68 as of 2013 for U.S. kids, <a href="http://www.autismspeaks.ca/about-autism/facts-and-stats/">1 in 48 boys, 1 in 189 girls in Canada will have it</a>, the explosive growth of this is directly attributable to vaccinations and the now annual vaccination rounds by those &quot;trustworthy&quot; pharmaceutical corporations. Suing won&#39;t even help you because the government is corrupt beyond redemption. It also costs a small fortune to rehabilitate children with low to mild forms of autism, let alone children with severe autism. Autism effectively destroys the economic capability of children with it, and makes them into an enormous financial liability to themselves in their economic prospects and to their parents, which is something that can severely impede them given that we&#39;ve had two depressions in the last thirteen years, one being 2001 and 2008, well unless you&#39;re involved in the military industrial complex, the banks, the hospitals or the insurance companies who now have a colossal new pool of insured suckers thanks to the unconstitutional Obamacare bill which forces people to pay for insurance, without a choice, a bill written by an active insurance executive now CEO in the medical industry, who goes by the name of<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/05/liz-fowler-johnson-johnson_n_2245367.html">Liz Fowler who worked on Democratic senator&#39;s Baucus&#39;s Finance committee</a>. </p>

<p>This argument is so over used and so distorted, I mean for christs sakes, people would surrounder their personal rights and obliterate the personal rights of others to a bunch of ultra corrupt oligarchs, and for what!? <a href="http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/06/breaking-obama-adminstration-scandal-hhs-employees-insider-trading/">So that government can force medicate on you on the behest of the pharmaceutical industry which pays them, when viruses and diseases are already easily kept at bay with just basic one time vaccinations?</a> The number of vaccinations you need are so minimal yet children are being bombarded with this garbage on an annual basis now despite the obvious show of information that vaccinations are detrimental to them in their earliest development years. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQsVTlMsQrI">On a similar note the yearly flu shot is becoming a round house joke</a>, even I became naturally skeptical prior to my awakening by the <a href="http://www.corbettreport.com/">real independent media</a>(just one great example) of how shitty the vaccination mechanization is. What I particularly remember was that <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/national-flu-outbreak-widens/">there&#39;s always a supposedly new flu variant every year and that pharmaceutical companies make a batch for every single year now, the whole thing is absurd and made me very skeptical of the industry for flu vaccinations</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was wondering if thimerosal alone was the problem, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be (as far as autism is concerned).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since 2001, no new vaccine licensed by FDA for use in children has contained thimerosal as a preservative and all vaccines routinely recommended by CDC for children younger than 6 years of age have been thimerosal-free, or contain only trace amounts of thimerosal, except for some formulations of influenza vaccine. Unfortunately, reductions in the numbers of children identified with autism have not been observed indicating that the cause of autism is not related to a single exposure such as thimerosal.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s something else, but it just doesn&#39;t seem likely to be because of vaccines.</p>

<p>It is definitely known, however, that older fathers increase the likelyhood of autism.  Weaker sperm, so IV also counts as a risk factor.  I know two men who became first time fathers in their 40s, and several couples who have had IV.  That, in combination with greater identification of autism (and what counts as autism) are more likely to explain the rise.</p>

<p>Really good stats/BBC video showing why the myth of effective vaccination as total rubbish, the decrease in infectious disease was directly attributed to poor health and sanitation conditions, Vaccinations in some cases caused an increase in outbreaks by destroying natural immunity and in some cases where there is occurrence, it&#39;s almost always in an economically depressed area, or an area where vaccinations themselves where distributed. </p>

<p>This is a weak premise, and not even a feasible explanation for the explosion of Autism since 2000, parents are having children later in life due to the severe economic disparity created by the banks in the recurrent deflations they cause. However this minority of aged parents is to small to explain the systemic spread of Autism, let alone the lack of anything hard to substantiate such a claim directly to autism. Vaccinations are given to a majority of children, <a href="http://childhealthsafety.wordpress.com/2009/06/03/japvaxautism/#000_Top_of_Page">the rise and fall of Autism can be directly traced to the distribution of it</a>. </p>

<p>Note on Asia Pacific and Chinese seafood which is sold as a majority of seafood product in North America, you do not want to buy it from China because obviously your asking for trouble, and second the radiation from Fukushima Daiichi is scheduled to hit our shores this year, in which there has been elevated levels of radiation detected already in the ocean water. The government is not reporting this to the general public to protect their regional ally in the Asia pacific as efforts progress to contain the Chinese military. All fish from the region likely contains traces of radioactivity from the failed reactors, even as early as of last year as Tuna migrates straight of the eastern coast of Japan where concentrations of radioactive materials are highest...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was making a comparative analysis to the typical intake of tuna consumption here versus the direct intravenous injection of the mercury based preservative into the blood stream at a significantly higher concentration. You&#39;re also correct to reference my own quote, mercury is not safe at any level, but people still like shrug it off with comparisons of other things as some sort of justification for its use in vaccination. Mercury in fish is quite the concern, I too have pondered consumption of tuna for some time, especially since almost all of it at local stores comes from &quot;Thailand&quot; which is basically the Asia Pacific, as well it doesn&#39;t help that the country is in the ecological shadow of China... </p>

<p>&quot;We don&#39;t think that demonizing those who choose not to be vaccinated is an appropriate response,&quot; states United Nurses of Alberta president Heather Smith, who also challenges the official view that flu immunizations are effective. Other nursing associations agree. The Ontario Nurses&#39; Association plans to file grievances against hospitals that require them to either become vaccinated or wear a face mask. In the U.S., National Nurses United, the country&#39;s largest organization of nurses, cites a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases study that found increased flu vaccination rates didn&#39;t lower death rates among the elderly, as is often claimed, or among any other age group either.</p>

<p>Stated National Nurses United president Karen Higgins last year, &quot;nurses, joined by many physician organizations and researchers, reject the notion that vaccination is a fail-safe solution to prevent the spread of the flu virus... there are health reasons why some elect not to be vaccinated. <strong>Some vaccine products have been withdrawn, as when Bell&#39;s palsy developed for many recipients</strong>. It has just been reported that 800 European children contracted narcolepsy, an incurable sleep disorder, after receiving the swine flu vaccine.&quot; The notion that the flu vaccine can be both ineffective and harmful, a CDC survey confirms, is common among health care workers.</p>

<p>Financial incentives for medical care workers to vaccinate:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/773399">http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/773399</a></p>

<p>Most doctors do not know anything about the real nature of vaccinations, they&#39;re just as brainwashed as the general public and not only that, their financially incentivized to believe and push this garbage on us.</p>

<p><a href="http://tenpennyimc.com/2011/12/24/why-do-doctors-push-vaccines/">http://tenpennyimc.com/2011/12/24/why-do-doctors-push-vaccines/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the beginning doctors are taught only the basic theories about of how vaccines work. They are told vaccines are safe and beneficial, and are directed to follow the ever-expanding vaccination schedules designed for children and adults. The vast majority robotically follow the recommendations, never questioning the safety or effectiveness of the directives.</p>

<p>Most physicians no doubt believe they are contributing to the health of vaccinated individuals and promoting the greater good of society. Few, if any, connect the deterioration of our nation’s health with the bloated vaccination schedule that now injects 40 doses of 16 vaccines into tiny bodies by five years of age. Indeed, more recently trained doctors may look at a truly healthy child as an anomaly. Their only experience has been treating children with diseases that are vaccine-induced but somehow thought to be part of “normal development.” When did doctors start believing that speech delays, sensory-integration disorders, asthma and eczema are normal parts of childhood? Why have doctors – and parents – accepted that attending OT, PT and speech therapy are “normal” parts of growing up?</p>

<p>There are not-so-subtle financial incentives that drive doctors to become vaccine pushers. I have read that pediatricians can earn a significant percentage of their income from vaccination, meaning, vaccines they push vaccines on their patients to keep a positive balance sheet. After all, a medical practice is a business, with sizable expenses such as malpractice insurance, staff salaries and rent. For physicians who are employees of a hospital system, there are fee quotas to meet so they can receive bonuses. Many of the vaccines in the inventory are expensive (for example, Gardasil and MMR) and some have very short expiration dates (i.e., flu shots and Flumist). Purchased vaccines need to be administered for costs to be recouped, and adding a shot, or shots, to a routine office visit generates more revenue. There is little doubt that financial pressures play a role in the thought process of those who push vaccination.</p>

<p>More:</p>

<p>Front line Healthcare workers know the B.S. of vaccinations first hand, 60% do not want to be harmed by these faulty drug products which they&#39;ve seen first hand cause the outbreaks they&#39;re supposed to prevent.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27214082/ns/health-cold_and_flu/t/even-health-care-workers-reject-flu-shots/#.U2hLJlfMenk">http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27214082/ns/health-cold_and_flu/t/even-health-care-workers-reject-flu-shots/#.U2hLJlfMenk</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Operating room nurse Pauline Taylor knows her refusal to get a flu shot is based on faulty logic.</p>

<p>But ever since she got sick after getting a shot a few years ago, she&#39;s sworn off the vaccine.</p>

<p>&quot;I rarely get sick. The only thing I could narrow it down to is that I had gotten this shot,&quot; said Taylor, who works at University Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City. &quot;I know that it&#39;s not a live virus. It just seemed pretty coincidental.&quot;</p>

<p>Such stories frustrate Dr. William Schaffner.</p>

<p>As chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University, he hears that kind of talk frequently and knows it&#39;s in part to blame for a surprising statistic — <strong>nearly 60 percent of health care workers fail to get a flu shot.</strong></p>

<p>That&#39;s despite recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that all health care workers get vaccinated, from hospital volunteers to doctors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there&#39;s more!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/lawrence-solomon/canada-vaccinations_b_4593168.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/lawrence-solomon/canada-vaccinations_b_4593168.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We don&#39;t think that demonizing those who choose not to be vaccinated is an appropriate response,&quot; states United Nurses of Alberta president Heather Smith, who also challenges the official view that flu immunizations are effective. Other nursing associations agree. The Ontario Nurses&#39; Association plans to file grievances against hospitals that require them to either become vaccinated or wear a face mask. In the U.S., National Nurses United, the country&#39;s largest organization of nurses, cites a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases study that found increased flu vaccination rates didn&#39;t lower death rates among the elderly, as is often claimed, or among any other age group either.</p>

<p>Stated National Nurses United president Karen Higgins last year, &quot;nurses, joined by many physician organizations and researchers, reject the notion that vaccination is a fail-safe solution to prevent the spread of the flu virus... there are health reasons why some elect not to be vaccinated. <strong>Some vaccine products have been withdrawn, as when Bell&#39;s palsy developed for many recipients</strong>. It has just been reported that 800 European children contracted narcolepsy, an incurable sleep disorder, after receiving the swine flu vaccine.&quot; The notion that the flu vaccine can be both ineffective and harmful, a CDC survey confirms, is common among health care workers.</p>

<p>Financial incentives for medical care workers to vaccinate:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/773399">http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/773399</a></p>

<p>Most doctors do not know anything about the real nature of vaccinations, they&#39;re just as brainwashed as the general public and not only that, their financially incentivized to believe and push this garbage on us.</p>

<p><a href="http://tenpennyimc.com/2011/12/24/why-do-doctors-push-vaccines/">http://tenpennyimc.com/2011/12/24/why-do-doctors-push-vaccines/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the beginning doctors are taught only the basic theories about of how vaccines work. They are told vaccines are safe and beneficial, and are directed to follow the ever-expanding vaccination schedules designed for children and adults. The vast majority robotically follow the recommendations, never questioning the safety or effectiveness of the directives.</p>

<p>Most physicians no doubt believe they are contributing to the health of vaccinated individuals and promoting the greater good of society. Few, if any, connect the deterioration of our nation’s health with the bloated vaccination schedule that now injects 40 doses of 16 vaccines into tiny bodies by five years of age. Indeed, more recently trained doctors may look at a truly healthy child as an anomaly. Their only experience has been treating children with diseases that are vaccine-induced but somehow thought to be part of “normal development.” When did doctors start believing that speech delays, sensory-integration disorders, asthma and eczema are normal parts of childhood? Why have doctors – and parents – accepted that attending OT, PT and speech therapy are “normal” parts of growing up?</p>

<p>There are not-so-subtle financial incentives that drive doctors to become vaccine pushers. I have read that pediatricians can earn a significant percentage of their income from vaccination, meaning, vaccines they push vaccines on their patients to keep a positive balance sheet. After all, a medical practice is a business, with sizable expenses such as malpractice insurance, staff salaries and rent. For physicians who are employees of a hospital system, there are fee quotas to meet so they can receive bonuses. Many of the vaccines in the inventory are expensive (for example, Gardasil and MMR) and some have very short expiration dates (i.e., flu shots and Flumist). Purchased vaccines need to be administered for costs to be recouped, and adding a shot, or shots, to a routine office visit generates more revenue. There is little doubt that financial pressures play a role in the thought process of those who push vaccination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part I, this is my own research, you can self verify my sources if you want and see if any of these dots line up for yourself.</p>

<p>Most people get their information on vaccination from propaganda from corporate, government subsidized mainstream media sites, you&#39;ve been lied to pretty hard and here&#39;s why, I&#39;ll try to explain it as expediently as I can, and there&#39;s a tons of info on vaccination production which I don&#39;t think you or anyone else outside of this subreddit, is fully aware off, to the excruciating detriment of us all. </p>

<p>Did you know, that the U.S. created <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court">Vaccinations Courts</a>, and a <a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/statisticsreports.html">Vaccination Fund</a> which can easily deflect lawsuits aimed at the Big Five Pharmaceutical Corporations. Not only that, in this government created, <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/01/sebelius-supported-by-figure-tied-to-fundraising-scandal/">corporate influenced court</a>, the United States Department of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services">Health and Human Services or HHS</a> for short can decide, a government apparatus, can decide what the cause of harm is to your person, instead of a normal court of law. This all flies in the face of the fact that the rates of Autism have exploded since <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html">2000 where 1 in 150 U.S. children had autism to now there being 1 in 68 children with Autism as off 2013</a>. In Canada for boys its worse!, <a href="http://www.autismspeaks.ca/about-autism/facts-and-stats/">1 in 42 boys will contract Autism this year, though for girls 1 in 189 will develop Autism as of 2014</a>!</p>

<p>There have been already cases which have obviously shown, by lawyers and doctors of victims that vaccination induced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalopathy">encephalopathy (brain disease)</a> lead directly to Autism. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/post2468343_b_2468343.html">Not only has this been clearly shown in a court of law</a>, where HHS, a government body openly decided against damning evidence of medical professionals which clearly showed the direct link between vaccination and autism. They have repeatedly in every case said that vaccination do not cause Autism, only in this corporate judicial system is this nightmare possible.</p>

<p>What motivation does big pharmaceutical have for making shoddy drugs and selling it to the public? <a href="http://vactruth.com/2012/11/30/2011-billions-vaccine-manufacturers">Merck alone earns more then 1.5 billion dollars from child vaccinations, the other four each receive over a billion from the government</a>. Not only are they shielded by the vaccination courts, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/post2468343_b_2468343.html">the government also shields and buries cases which clearly have seen a direct causal link between vaccinations and Autism</a>. </p>

<p>People love to say stupid uninformed things like, vaccinations are solid science, or why would scientists and doctors kill us with totally defective pharmaceutical products? Vaccine drugs not even effective in preventing outbreaks, but are the actual sources of current day outbreaks themselves. Fact, vaccinations last only a few years, actual viral infection and normal body white cell response creates a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twch-T-n8Ns&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">life time of immunity from the virus itself</a>. Fact, most doctors receive <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/topics/health-concerns/vaccines/do-doctors-have-financial-incentive-get-their-patients-fully-vaccinated">financial incentives</a> from big pharmaceuticals to immunize your children with a full bombardment of drugs(vaccinations), often at birth or in the first critical months of their lives. Some people for some reason think Doctors and Scientists are morally superior beings, that is one of the greatest perceptual fallacies in North America. These people operate with the naive and blind trust of the public when in fact they&#39;re just human beings out to make a quick buck. Do these people care enough to actually research vaccination development? Probably not, arm chair citizen researchers know more about it then doctors because they&#39;ve actually done the research themselves. It should be obviously noted that doctors are not gods, the medical sphere is massive, specialization takes years in one specific study. Their knowledge and understanding of other medical fields is particularly acute and limited, it&#39;s not such a stupid idea that an internet researcher could know far more about drug vaccinations then a medical family physician, lest we forget <a href="http://tenpennyimc.com/2011/12/24/why-do-doctors-push-vaccines/">these people are financially incentivized to pump you and your kids full of drugs</a>. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the other kicker, vaccination production, vaccinations aren&#39;t made in just chicken eggs, they&#39;ve made from cows and monkeys as well. So what, farm animals, what&#39;s the problem there? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeMYl_UH8Mo">Bayer made a batch of vaccinations from HIV infected monkey&#39;s and sold it in the North American market, when it was discovered the FDA and the U.S. federal government allowed Bayer to sell the HIV laden drugs to other countries, countries in Europe, Asia and in Aids ridden Africa so that they could turn a back a profit on it. Why did they use HIV monkeys? because these African monkeys where cheaper to purchase then monkeys from other countries. Not only that not one person in Bayer was held legally responsible for this in the United States, yet in every other country they sold it in, their executives where hunted in the individual countries judicial system.</a> Here&#39;s the other problem, we cannot filter out the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1m3TjokVU4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">dna of these animals from which we create vaccinations, this means viral contaminates like HIV, madcow(prions), antibiotic super viruses can spread from animal</a> to vaccine to human. </p>

<p>Side note on antibiotic super viruses/bacteria: Pigs, chickens and cows are all given hormone boosters to quicken the development of muscle mass and milk production. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6oq7X5G2f0">Bovine growth hormone</a> has already been shown to be dangerous to humans who even eat or drink cow byproduct of any kind as the U.S. is the only G7 member to allow it for commercial use in the development of food product. Animals are also given huge amounts of antibiotics to keep them healthy in super <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_animal_farming">crowded, massive animal farms</a>,  like a gaint petri dish where if even one animal with a sickness develops <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2012/07/antibiotic-use-vaccines-factory-farms-creating-new-pathogens">antibiotic resistance</a>, it spreads quite a bit the group. Some of these animals are diverted and sold to vaccination development. The other fun fact is that <a href="http://healthvermont.gov/prevent/salmonella/salmonella.aspx">eggs are one of the primary carriers of salmonella food poisoning</a>, again since <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1m3TjokVU4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">vaccine developers have admitted to being unable to remove viruses or bacteria</a>, this crap can still get into pharmaceutical drugs. </p>

<p>This concludes Part I</p>

<p>Front line Healthcare workers know the B.S. of vaccinations first hand, 60% do not want to be harmed by these faulty drug products which they&#39;ve seen first hand cause the outbreaks they&#39;re supposed to prevent.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27214082/ns/health-cold_and_flu/t/even-health-care-workers-reject-flu-shots/#.U2hLJlfMenk">http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27214082/ns/health-cold_and_flu/t/even-health-care-workers-reject-flu-shots/#.U2hLJlfMenk</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Operating room nurse Pauline Taylor knows her refusal to get a flu shot is based on faulty logic.</p>

<p>But ever since she got sick after getting a shot a few years ago, she&#39;s sworn off the vaccine.</p>

<p>&quot;I rarely get sick. The only thing I could narrow it down to is that I had gotten this shot,&quot; said Taylor, who works at University Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City. &quot;I know that it&#39;s not a live virus. It just seemed pretty coincidental.&quot;</p>

<p>Such stories frustrate Dr. William Schaffner.</p>

<p>As chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University, he hears that kind of talk frequently and knows it&#39;s in part to blame for a surprising statistic — <strong>nearly 60 percent of health care workers fail to get a flu shot.</strong></p>

<p>That&#39;s despite recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that all health care workers get vaccinated, from hospital volunteers to doctors.</p>

<p>And there&#39;s more!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/lawrence-solomon/canada-vaccinations_b_4593168.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/lawrence-solomon/canada-vaccinations_b_4593168.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We don&#39;t think that demonizing those who choose not to be vaccinated is an appropriate response,&quot; states United Nurses of Alberta president Heather Smith, who also challenges the official view that flu immunizations are effective. Other nursing associations agree. The Ontario Nurses&#39; Association plans to file grievances against hospitals that require them to either become vaccinated or wear a face mask. In the U.S., National Nurses United, the country&#39;s largest organization of nurses, cites a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases study that found increased flu vaccination rates didn&#39;t lower death rates among the elderly, as is often claimed, or among any other age group either.</p>

<p>Stated National Nurses United president Karen Higgins last year, &quot;nurses, joined by many physician organizations and researchers, reject the notion that vaccination is a fail-safe solution to prevent the spread of the flu virus... there are health reasons why some elect not to be vaccinated. <strong>Some vaccine products have been withdrawn, as when Bell&#39;s palsy developed for many recipients</strong>. It has just been reported that 800 European children contracted narcolepsy, an incurable sleep disorder, after receiving the swine flu vaccine.&quot; The notion that the flu vaccine can be both ineffective and harmful, a CDC survey confirms, is common among health care workers.</p>

<p>Financial incentives for medical care workers to vaccinate:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/773399">http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/773399</a></p>

<p>Most doctors do not know anything about the real nature of vaccinations, they&#39;re just as brainwashed as the general public and not only that, their financially incentivized to believe and push this garbage on us.</p>

<p><a href="http://tenpennyimc.com/2011/12/24/why-do-doctors-push-vaccines/">http://tenpennyimc.com/2011/12/24/why-do-doctors-push-vaccines/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the beginning doctors are taught only the basic theories about of how vaccines work. They are told vaccines are safe and beneficial, and are directed to follow the ever-expanding vaccination schedules designed for children and adults. The vast majority robotically follow the recommendations, never questioning the safety or effectiveness of the directives.</p>

<p>Most physicians no doubt believe they are contributing to the health of vaccinated individuals and promoting the greater good of society. Few, if any, connect the deterioration of our nation’s health with the bloated vaccination schedule that now injects 40 doses of 16 vaccines into tiny bodies by five years of age. Indeed, more recently trained doctors may look at a truly healthy child as an anomaly. Their only experience has been treating children with diseases that are vaccine-induced but somehow thought to be part of “normal development.” When did doctors start believing that speech delays, sensory-integration disorders, asthma and eczema are normal parts of childhood? Why have doctors – and parents – accepted that attending OT, PT and speech therapy are “normal” parts of growing up?</p>

<p>There are not-so-subtle financial incentives that drive doctors to become vaccine pushers. I have read that pediatricians can earn a significant percentage of their income from vaccination, meaning, vaccines they push vaccines on their patients to keep a positive balance sheet. After all, a medical practice is a business, with sizable expenses such as malpractice insurance, staff salaries and rent. For physicians who are employees of a hospital system, there are fee quotas to meet so they can receive bonuses. Many of the vaccines in the inventory are expensive (for example, Gardasil and MMR) and some have very short expiration dates (i.e., flu shots and Flumist). Purchased vaccines need to be administered for costs to be recouped, and adding a shot, or shots, to a routine office visit generates more revenue. There is little doubt that financial pressures play a role in the thought process of those who push vaccination.</p>

<p>They do. Some professionally, others are genuinely scared and when one puts forth an idea that contradicts their narrative they lose their shit. This is common for the average citizen because they have a self-serving life narrative and who are you to tell them they are wrong?</p>

I guess because instead of black lines, they put blank spots. Ugh.</p>

<p>In the threads, you see two opposing factions: &quot;don&#39;t even talk about it, shut up, kids died, have some respect&quot; and &quot;nothing happened, no one died, it&#39;s an elaborate hoax with crisis actors&quot; but no middle ground or anyone actually trying to get the State to release real information about what caused this. You&#39;d think that releasing information would be of utmost importance to at least the hoax-theory pushers. Or gun proponents. Or gun opponents. Or the community itself. The entire case is filled-to-the-brim with FUD.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your premise is full of fallacies, making it difficult to answer.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>People don&#39;t hate and ridicule &quot;all the common topics&quot; discussed here. You are making a broad generalization that you can&#39;t back up with fact. Using &quot;all&quot; is a common tactic of someone unwilling to look at the issue in detail. People have differing opinions on multiple subjects. I agree with posts here, and disagree with others. That is the common state for members of this subreddit. You saying &quot;all&quot; is a clear attempt to limit discussion of the real issue. </p></li>
<li><p>This subreddit makes the effort to attack/challenge many different areas of people&#39;s lives, unlike <a href="/r/planes">/r/planes</a>. The comparison makes no sense. This subreddit is here to create controversy. It makes no sense to be surprised that is does what it is designed to do. </p></li>
<li><p>That other subreddit doesn&#39;t exist just to mock this subreddit. Based on your claim, I went over there for the second time ever. There are only a few submissions referencing this subreddit. So, again, you are making an assertion not based on fact. A fallacious appeal.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Why would anyone spend their time knocking down ideas? That is what this subreddit does all day, every day. The real question is why are you so upset that people might have an opinion that differs from yours? </p>
