<p>There are real Christians in the world (not &quot;Christian zionists&quot; or Westboro Baptists) who have read and studied the Bible.  It appears you&#39;ve gotten your understanding of the book from the Zeitgeist movie, or something similar.  Again, no offense intended, but you probably shouldn&#39;t comment on a book you&#39;ve never read.  It makes you look, well, not very smart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(Non religious) Jew conspiracy theorist here who does not want to kill anyone.</p>

<p>There are two reasons why I would like you to stop referring to the &quot;bad Jews&quot; as just &quot;Jews&quot;.</p>

<p>First, even if some Jews believe in strange religious scripture, most don&#39;t. Most Jews in America are not particularly religious. It&#39;s like saying all Muslims must be put in camps because they all want to kill us. Actually only the daesh sort do.</p>

<p>The second reason is because it turns people away from good theories unneccessarily. Jews and non Jews alike. It makes you look nutty. And to be fair it is pretty nutty. </p>

<p>I suggest you think of a new term for the elite Jews you want to theorise about, other than &quot;Jews&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.</p>

<p>The Jews are the problem beause of the belief they hold, that &quot;Even the best of the Goyim should all be killed&quot;, each Jew must hold this belief to even be a Jew, the steadfast holding of this belief makes every Jew a psychopath.</p>

<p>To be a true Jew, the Jew MUST believe that &quot;Even the best of the Goyim should all be killed&quot;. This is right out of the Talmud, the main religioius book ALL Jews must follow.</p>

Let&#39;s go with that. Let&#39;s apply affirmative action to the whites trying to get into Harvard University that can&#39;t because Jews already took their slots. Lets apply affirmative action to the media, where white journalists are trying to get jobs, but can&#39;t because the media is wholly dominated by Jews. Let&#39;s apply it to the Supreme Court, and have a 2% Jew rule, so that the members of the court match the percentage of Jews in society. Let&#39;s make sure that whites get the contracts and government jobs and perks, and Jews only get 2% of them. It would work for me.</p>
