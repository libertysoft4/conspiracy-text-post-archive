        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Okay so here is a conspiracy theory about toothpaste and how it is being used to make money. We all know healthcare in the US isn&#39;t free so if you need to go to the dentist or doctors you have to pay, toothpaste is meant to help your teeth stay strong and fresh so we all use it. So if we all use it twice a day and there is something damaging your teeth in toothpaste then your teeth will have problems and have to pay to get them fixed. I live in the UK and have only had to get my teeth straightened (which was free as we have free healthcare), I&#39;ve never had a cavity dispite my sweet tooth and brush my teeth twice a day, so maybe it&#39;s only in American toothpaste as you have to pay to get them fixed when damaged. So what do you all think? Is toothpaste being used to damaged teeth so you have to go to the dentist and pay to get your teeth fixed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just provided a great example of how those who are uneducated spread the most mistruth and cause spread of an already growing epidemic (dental caries). </p>

<p>The articles you posted are terrible. Even the ones that make mention to genetics are related to people having different dietary preferences based on heredity (duh?). The simple fact that your diet habits are the number one influence on rate of caries doesn&#39;t change in that fact.  One of the articles you posted even mentions soft enamel... Ugh. Automatic discredit from any educated individual as there is no such thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good to know.  I&#39;ll go tell my dentist and orthodontist that he&#39;s full of shit.  I&#39;ll also tell my wife who brushes three times a day and religiously watches what she eats because of her massive amount of tooth decay, that the dentist is full of shit too.  I&#39;ll tell her its her fault that she gets teeth decaying from the inside out.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be happy to know that Reddit was there to help her out when every dentist hasn&#39;t known shit.  </p>

<p>So anonymous reddit username, what should she do to prevent these crazy different tooth decay problems? She brushes after every meal and flosses religiously.  Her teeth LOOK emaculate but then they start hurting, she gets an xray, and the center of the tooth is rotting out.  Now up till now she&#39;s been told its genetic, and our son has it as well and her father had it too.  But since thats bullshit and so rare that it shouldn&#39;t be common place to my ears, let me know what to do next. </p>

<p>Thanks! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Get the X-ray so i can see the decay from the inside out. I guarantee that&#39;s not how it&#39;s happening. Then we&#39;ll move on from there. Any dentist who says its genetic is being lazy and not wanting to help a patient modify their diet and hygiene. </p>

<p>You go to a PPO/HMO/DHMO dentist. They don&#39;t make enough off you to give a shit about educating you on dental disease. Thus are content with letting you believe it&#39;s genetics as a scapegoat instead of taking the time to educate and investigate why you&#39;re getting the problems you are. </p>
