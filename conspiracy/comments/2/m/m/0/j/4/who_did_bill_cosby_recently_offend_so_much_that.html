    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a theory that the weather underground was infiltrated by Larry Grathwohl.  During his time undercover they told him in meetings that they wanted a race war.  They wanted to take over America and sell parts of it to other countries like China.  Bill Ayers was one of those people in the weather underground.  The people in charge today have connections with Bill Ayers.  And the policies they create and the tone of race baiting in the media, knowing the media is tilted toward the socialists agenda (which is what the weather underground wanted also), and selling off America to other countries - IE Globalization - India, China, etc... allowing mexico free rein and open borders.  Watching them say they want a one world government and new world order.  It&#39;s hard not to think there is a real threat and coup taking place by these same people who share the same ideology.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s false, the term was in use long before Bush uttered it.  Look no further than one H.G. Wells, renowned author, member of the Cecil Rhodes Round Table Society, and head of British intelligence during WWII (somewhat little known fact).  He literally wrote a book called <em>The New World Order</em> in 1940, along with a bunch of others that either explicitly or implicitly dealt with the exact same subject such as <em>The Open Conspiracy: Blueprints for a World Revolution</em> and <em>The Shape of Things to Come: The Ultimate Revolution</em>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Your mistake is in not realizing that these are just two sides of the same coin, ultimately created, co-opted, and/or controlled by the same group of people.</p>

Wells was a socialist and did write a book called the New World Order, but that&#39;s not to be confused with the &quot;New World Order&quot; proposed by Bush. They are two different things.</p>

<p>Capitalism and socialism are two different, opposed ideas: One says that property should be privately owned and operated for profit, and the other says that property should be owned by workers and operated on the basis of need. Completely different ideas. </p>

<p>They actually aren&#39;t at all - have you read the book?  The idea is a One World &quot;socialist&quot; government controlled by a &quot;ruling elite&quot;.  The real life applications of these ideologies are nothing like the textbook definitions of the words.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware that what we have in America currently is neither capitalism nor democracy - this is what I&#39;m getting at.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Capitalism and socialism are two different, opposed ideas</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m aware that, in theory, they&#39;re two different ideas.  But, in practice, both are just ideologies used as tools by the same elite.  It&#39;s the hegelian idea of thesis + antithesis = synthesis.</p>

<p>Capitalism is the thesis, socialism/communism are the antitheses.  Look at what&#39;s actually happening and has happened in the real world instead of at the textbook definitions.</p>

<p>Citation? Don&#39;t see his name mentioned in the Wikipedia article. Why would H.G. Wells, of all people, want to get involved in some sort of imperialist organisation? H.G. Wells didn&#39;t like imperialism. </p>

<p>Recall my definition of capitalism- Private ownership of means of production, operated for profit. Indeed this is what you do have in America, more or less. A mixed market economy, like almost everyone else. </p>

<p>If what we have now is a dialectic synthesis of capitalism and communism (which it isn&#39;t), then presumably, from this new thesis, an antithesis will arise? Because that&#39;s how the dialectic works. </p>

<p>Unfortunately for this theory, what we have now is not a dialectical synthesis of capitalism and communism, but simply neoliberal capitalism, with mixed market economies. That&#39;s the model that has triumphed almost everywhere. Don&#39;t confuse that with whatever H.G. Wells was talking about in 1940. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you serious?  If it isn&#39;t on wikipedia it doesn&#39;t exist?  Literally 10 seconds on google would have confirmed the historical fact that he was a member of the Cecil Rhodes society.  Go ahead, try it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would H.G. Wells, of all people, want to get involved in some sort of imperialist organisation? H.G. Wells didn&#39;t like imperialism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you&#39;re misinformed about our friend H.G.  Like I said, he was the head of British intelligence during WWII and was a clear proponent of the NWO.  Just read a couple of those books I mentioned before yourself, you&#39;ll see the entire agenda for the future outlined as he saw it.</p>

<p>For example, in his first will he literally wrote of the desire to fund a secret society aimed at bringing about: &quot;...the extension of British rule throughout the world, the perfecting of a system of emigration from the United Kingdom and of colonization by British subjects of all lands wherein the means of livelihood are attainable by energy, labour and enterprise... and the ultimate recovery of the United States of America as an integral part of the British Empire.&quot;</p>

<p>He also described one world government as &quot;manifestly the only possible solution of the human problem.&quot;</p>

<p>This guy &quot;didn&#39;t like imperialism&quot;?  Really?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Indeed this is what you do have in America, <strong>more or less</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s that &quot;more or less&quot; qualification that you&#39;re glazing over but which really makes all the difference.  The collusion between corporate/state/banking power that we see in America, as well as all of the foreign influence we&#39;re subjected to, is nothing even remotely resembling the textbook definition capitalism.  But again, this is still just a label which isn&#39;t what we should be concerned about.  Bickering over definitions doesn&#39;t change the reality we find ourselves in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If what we have now is a dialectic synthesis of capitalism and communism (which it isn&#39;t)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The synthesis is the one world government.  We obviously aren&#39;t there yet and I never claimed that what we have now is a synthesis of these ideas.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what we have now is not a dialectical synthesis of capitalism and communism, but simply neoliberal capitalism, with mixed market economies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re so caught up on these word constructions and ideologies that you&#39;re ignoring the obvious staring you in the face which is that, quite simply, there is a self-proclaimed &quot;elite&quot; and then there is the rest of us.  There are enslavers and the enslaved and they&#39;ve been pushing their agenda forward for the last 300+ years (at minimum).  It isn&#39;t really much more complicated than that and the &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; are simply tools.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did Google it. The only reference to H.G. Wells and Cecil Rhodes was some Google books result where Wells is quoted as saying that he never met him. </p>

<p>H.G. Wells was never &quot;the head of British intelligence&quot;. H.G. Wells was a novelist, and also an outspoken socialist. The British intelligence service does not recruit outspoken socialists, not now and not then. Mi5 and 6 have had lots of director generals, but H.G. Wells was not one of them. 
The head of Mi6 during the war was Stewart Menzies.</p>

<p>I have read H.G. Wells. &quot;A Modern Utopia&quot; and so on. Wells was a socialist. Not an imperialist or a conservative. That quote that you&#39;ve written comes from <strong>Cecil Rhodes</strong>, who died in 1902. </p>

<p>Yes, H.G. Wells didn&#39;t like imperialism. You&#39;re confusing him with Cecil Rhodes. Wells did, however, believe in a world government, a very common belief among socialists in the early part of the 20th century. You&#39;re confusing two completely different people, one of whom was an imperialist, and the other of whom was a socialist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>nothing even remotely resembling the textbook definition capitalism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do we have private ownership of means of production and production for profit or not? Yes, we do. Therefore it resembles the textbook definition pretty closely. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>there is a self-proclaimed &quot;elite&quot; and then there is the rest of us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. And in America and the West, that self-proclaimed elite is capitalistic and not socialistic. </p>

<p>&quot;Left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; have meanings. I can&#39;t agree that they simply don&#39;t mean anything. The basic idea of the left is equality, and the basic idea of the right is hierarchy. </p>

<p>But you are right, I did misspeak when I said that quote was from Wells rather than Rhodes.  The point still stands though (if it can be shown that Wells was a member of the Rhodes Society).</p>

<p>On the one hand, you&#39;ve got Rhodes (who died in 1902, remember), and his Round Table council. Imperialist, capitalist businessmen. </p>

<p>On the other, Wells and the Fabians. Socialists, writers, political figures.</p>

<p>Rhodes: Let&#39;s have a world dominated by the British Empire and capitalism.</p>

<p>Wells: Let&#39;s have a world dominated by a socialist system and internationalism. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how you can say these huge differences don&#39;t matter. </p>

<p>If you want to talk about enslavers and enslaved, I&#39;d put Rhodes in one camp and Wells in the other. </p>

<p>The point I&#39;ve been trying to make is that it doesn&#39;t matter what terminology is used: liberal, communist, socialist, capitalist, etc.  The terms themselves <em>do not matter</em> when talking about the NWO.  What matters is the actions taken in their name and the end goal which, in all cases, is a one world government controlled by a small &quot;ruling elite&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As to the sources, I don&#39;t know. But I do know that this association of Cecil Rhodes and H.G. Wells is rubbish. Honestly, I&#39;m wouldn&#39;t lie or conceal the truth about this. </p>

<p>When one man (Rhodes) is a capitalist businessman, and imperialist, and the other (Wells) is a socialist internationalist, who is opposed to capitalist business and imperialism, how can you say that that difference doesn&#39;t matter? The two ideas are opposed. </p>

<p>I did read Well&#39;s &quot;A Modern Utopia&quot;, from about 1905, and there are lots of daft ideas in it, such as that recidivists and chronic drunks and gamblers should be put on an island. George Orwell critiques some of Well&#39;s more dated ideas in The Road To Wigan Pier and elsewhere. </p>

<p>But that has got nothing to do with the Bush &quot;New World Order&quot;, which meant that Russia had lost and American capitalism had won. H.G. Wells was a novelist. </p>

<p>I&#39;m saying that, in <em>this</em> case, the difference is entirely superficial because both Wells and Rhodes were members of the British &quot;elite&quot;.  <em>That</em> is the most important piece of information to keep in mind, not whether they publicly identified as a capitalist or as a socialist.  This is the same mistake people make today when they talk about US democrats and republicans being opposed without realizing that they&#39;re both working for the same people and pushing the same (ultimate) agenda.</p>

<p>When socialism and capitalism are both tools used by the same group of &quot;elites&quot;, and when the definition of the terms in no way match the reality of how they&#39;re being implemented, and when both ideologies are leading to a one world government ruled by the few, then the labels themselves become mostly meaningless - which has been my point all along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But H.G. Wells <em>wasn&#39;t</em> a part of the British elite. He was a novelist who happened to be a socialist. If you think the British elite is tolerant of avowed socialists, especially ones from ordinary middle class backgrounds like Wells, then you don&#39;t know much about it. He was looked down upon by the British establishment for his progressive ideas and for not having gone to a public school. He was not a politician and had not much power. He was just a man who wrote books, some of them good and some of them silly. </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t agree that the words capitalism and socialism are meaningless. The people that rule the world, and the ideas that rule the world, are definitely capitalistic, not socialistic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was a Fabian.  They are an &quot;elite&quot; society through and through and they always have been.</p>

<p>He was also close personal friends with <em>numerous</em> &quot;movers and shakers&quot; and members of the British establishment.  I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re getting his being an outsider from.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>And my point is that the people who rule the world (or who desire to) don&#39;t really care about names or ideologies outside of how they can be used as tools.  An example of this, again, are the Fabians.  Apparently a &quot;socialist&quot; society but if you look at some of their members and what they&#39;ve been involved in historically, it&#39;s pretty clear that this is simply a group of &quot;elites&quot; working towards a one world government.  The term &quot;socialist&quot;, in this case, is at best misleading and at worst meaningless.  We all get so focused on the terms that we ignore what&#39;s being done in their name and whether or not these things are consistent with the definitions of the terms.  They quite often aren&#39;t.</p>

<p>We&#39;re going to have to agree to disagree on this one I think.  Just keep in mind that any word that ends in &quot;-ism&quot; is a dogmatic ideology and almost every one of them was either directly created and/or later co-opted by the globalists I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<p>It&#39;s well known that certain sections of the left, as well as the right, 100 years ago, were in favour of eugenics. I just don&#39;t know what bearing that has on the modern world, at all.

<p>That&#39;s a very good example of the kind of thinking that happens when you just don&#39;t care what the terms &quot;socialism&quot; and &quot;capitalism&quot; mean. Believe it or not, the system we have now is called neoliberal capitalism.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right.  I try to focus, though, on actions instead of words.  By that I mean when someone claims to be promoting socialism, I look at what they&#39;re actually <em>doing</em> rather than at what they <em>would be doing</em> if it were true socialism.  People say Obamacare is socialist and I just have to lol and tell them to look at what it <em>actually is</em> as opposed to what it&#39;s <em>claimed to be</em>.</p>

<p>The current power structure in most of the world is elite vs. the rest of us.  That&#39;s it.  Throw out all of the word constructions, all of the definitions, and look at what&#39;s actually happening.  All of the religions and -isms are used as much as possible by these people as tools to further this &quot;us vs. them&quot; paradigm, to keep us all divided and fighting amongst ourselves, to keep us distracted, etc.</p>

<p>This is what I mean when I say the words themselves don&#39;t matter.  It isn&#39;t that they literally don&#39;t matter, or that they literally have no meaning, it&#39;s that they don&#39;t matter in the context of discussing the &quot;elite&quot; and the ways we&#39;re all being fucked over by them.</p>

<p>As an example, Bolshevism was funded almost completely by Wall Street and its allies.  It was a sinister parody of Communism, so to study <em>actual</em> communism is meaningless here if you want to understand what really happened - and it would likely only confuse you more.  I hope this makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A celebrity gets accused of unwelcomed forgotten sex years ago all the time. Cosby grew up in the 60s and 70s when drugs were everywhere.  Even if you beleive their completely unsubstatiated stories its pretty hard to say they didnt wsnt to be i  a star&#39;s bed if they were hanging out with him.  None of them accussed him of forcing them off the street at knife or gu point into his car or house did they?  No. So they wanted to be there near the star. But we aresupposed to beleive i the era of free love and drugs they were the few who wanted to be nesr him alone but NOT have sex with him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well according to another redditors post above Cosby apparently criticised black people in Ferguson so he didnt play along with the agenda to make black people the victims there and THATS why Cosby is getting the slapdown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What?  These allegations have been waged for decades.  It&#39;s more popular now because more people are on the internet now and more news media is desperate for ratings.  Hannibal Buress (a comedian) brought this shit up during a standup comedy routine a month or so ago so now it&#39;s getting mainstream traction.  Maybe Bill Cosby was a scumbag?  Who knows.  I don&#39;t see how this would tie into anything political.  Nobody really was talking about the guy until these charges came up again.</p>

<p>“Bill Cosby has the f—ing smuggest old black man public persona that I hate,” Buress said. “He just gets on TV — ‘Pull your pants up, black people. I was on TV in the ’80s. I can talk down to you because I had a successful sitcom.’ Yeah, but you raped women, Bill Cosby. So, brings you down a couple notches.”</p>

<p>Of course i knew about the no name comedian mentioning cosby but that would not be news worthy it self unless someone WANTED it to be.</p>

<p>However the reason above most likely IS the reason becuase Cosby isnt playing along with the news runners agenda of Ferguson victimization.</p>
