        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Many (if not most) sub-reddits are controlled by moderators who feel the need to heavily censor what is posted, to control the dialogue, it&#39;s all very authoritarian. However in this sub-reddit content is allowed to be posted, even stuff that only loosely seems to tie into conspiracies at first glance.</p>

<p>For example this post: <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2m4zqm/2yearold_taken_away_from_parents_because_they/">2-year-old taken away from parents because they used marijuana, resulted in being killed by foster mother</a> isn&#39;t directly about a conspiracy but ties into the child abduction conspiracy that is fostered through &quot;child protective services&quot;, the drug war conspiracy, and the general authoritarian police state we live in, and thus should stand.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve dealt with a lot of censorship in other sub-reddits, as this is not my first account. Some moderators have even demanded that I explain in minute detail why an article is relevant, even if it should be obvious - and a lot of the time they still disagree based on their own biases. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> doesn&#39;t seem to have this problem, and that&#39;s the reason it&#39;s one of the only sub-reddits I find worth reading and participating in.</p>

<p>Open discussion on controversial topics must be allowed for knowledge to spread. Thanks to the moderators for taking a more hands-off approach than many sub-reddit moderators who take an authoritarian, obsessively controlling approach that is detrimental to allowing people the room to breathe and learn.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Not only for their vigorous anti-censorship attitude, as you said, but also for their efforts toward the betterment of the sub by doing things like setting up AMA&#39;s and featured documentaries.</p>

<p>It was not overt censorship, it was intelligent censorship requested by the user base for the purpose of protecting <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> .</p>

<p>I have visited Dachau and Birkenau, and many more WWII sites such as bunkers and rail yards, etc.</p>

<p>The holocaust happened. The details? Now that is where there is still room for debate, as it turns out that many of the claims of numbers of people enslaved were exaggerated as were some other claims of what was done with their bodies, like the false skin lampshade myth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.</p>

<p>A couple months back there was an odd influx of anti-Semitic posts and conspiratards. Lately things seem to have cooled off. As you&#39;d noted, people have been strikingly friendly of late. I&#39;m glad I toughed through the lame year-long influx of bad-vibe attacks. </p>

<p>And while I see a lot of silly posts, I also see a ot more proper content lately. I think this is because people are very comfortable posting and not getting shit for posting about things that actually are on their mind.</p>

<p>No, but you stated this.</p>

<p>I can not determine whether or not those bans were a result of you actually violating rules, or the mods being corrupted, without any evidence to support either of those possibilities.</p>

<p>I only care about the validity of those bans because you use those bans to preface your argument and support your further claims.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That is the point of me &quot;telling it like is it&quot;, so that you understand why you stating that you&#39;ve been banned near a dozen times doesn&#39;t do much to help your case, as they could have been for entirely legitimate reasons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s a bit disingenuous because have you been here and seen people get banned?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have seen too much to be able to know what the whole of the situation is in any of those incidents.</p>

<p>I have seen enough to know that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is most definitely infiltrated, and that there are probably 2 or 3 mods who may be in on it, considering that <a href="/u/IlluminatedWax">/u/IlluminatedWax</a> is the only 6 year old mod, and everybody else is 1 year old or younger.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a member of reddit and on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for over 6 years, why the fuck aren&#39;t I a mod?</p>

<p>I am not corrupt, nor do I hide my &quot;agendas&quot;, and I use logical debate and rationality to argue my points, unlike all of the propagandist rhetoric shills that post responses that are logical fallacies and ad hominid attacks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s so ridiculous that people act like TPTB control reddit but somehow <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> roams free. Please.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree, and the agendas being pushed are more than obvious.</p>

<p><a href="/u/Mister_Dong">/u/Mister_Dong</a> is obviously and blatantly pushing the alien agenda, never before has a mod been given a special little image next to their name of stupid &quot;gray&quot; alien, which yet again are a part of establishment propaganda.</p>

<p>There is ZERO evidence for &quot;gray&quot; aliens, only clearly propagandist attempst to subvert peoples thinking like the forged area 51 alien autopsy video.</p>

<p>The problem is reddit, anybody can create a new account and start trolling/shilling/persona managing that account with 8 other accounts to spread propaganda/rhetoric/ideology/whatever.</p>

<p>Unless the mods take a harder stance and enact stronger rules ( only 3 link submissions a day to prevent link spamming and content burial, for example ), this sub will continue to be inundated by shills/trolls and their agendas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub is more tolerant of <em>some</em> topics. That makes it a better place to be than most other subs, which are so intolerant of original thought as to be unuseable.</p>

<p>However, there is still a strong Hasbara/JIDL presence here, which attempts to quell any real discussion of Jewish topics such as the Holocaust or Israel or Jewish power in America.</p>

<p>Comments or criticisms of the homosexual and vague-gender movements are met with a wall of hostility.</p>

<p>It is also difficult or impossible to comment honestly about race on this sub. Any politically incorrect comments about blacks are apt to be gang-attacked, or even banned, with no regard to the validity of the actual content.</p>

<p>Comments about problems facing whites are apt to be labeled &quot;white supremacist&quot;. There are many people who don&#39;t want whites to talk about white racial problems.</p>

<p>So, while this sub is more open than most on Reddit, it is far from a truly open forum for debate ... as those who have been banned multiple times under various names can testify.</p>

<p>&quot;Honestly&quot;? To me it&#39;s more like thinly veiled, and let&#39;s call it what it is, <em>racism</em>, that&#39;s the real snake oil you are trying to peddle here, so let&#39;s not sugar coat it. There are subreddits for white self-pity, disdain for other races and those types of race issues, subreddits you fully know about. Those subreddits are the place for that kind of thought exchange, not <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Putting that kind of hate in this sub is just an attempt to spread intolerant thought to a wider audience who by and large don&#39;t want to read it here. If that&#39;s what they want to read they will go to those subs. Personally I sometimes agree with what you are saying <em>until</em> is crosses over into intolerance and disdain for other races, beliefs or lifestyles. </p>

<p>If you want to debate your racial intolerance, homophobia and the poor white man&#39;s burden you know where the subreddits are for that. I think that is where that stuff belongs, (assuming it belongs <em>anywhere</em>) I hate seeing it in this subreddit, to me it is a complete turn off.</p>

<p>Kevin MacDonald has proven otherwise: <a href="https://archive.org/details/CultureOfCritique">https://archive.org/details/CultureOfCritique</a></p>

<p>As I said in the original post:</p>

<p>allowing people the room to breathe and learn</p>

<p>is what&#39;s important. And so censoring comments about the anti-white conspiracy or the anti-heterosexual and anti-family conspiracies which have been fomented through feminism, anti-white racism, and promotion of homosexuality over heterosexuality is ill-advised, as it prevents the users from learning and growing in their knowledge base so that they may understand the conspiratorial nature of social movements.</p>

<p>Syncretism /ˈsɪŋkrətɪzəm/ is the combining of different, often seemingly contradictory beliefs, while melding practices of various schools of thought. Syncretism involves the merger and analogizing of several originally discrete traditions, especially in the theology and mythology of religion, thus asserting an underlying unity and allowing for an inclusive approach to other faiths. Syncretism also occurs commonly in expressions of arts and culture (known as eclecticism) as well as politics (syncretic politics).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re trying to use my argument to disprove my argument. You say we talk about both, but posts regarding the bigger picture are buried under these symptomatic posts. </p>

<p>We already know the disease. We know the source of these symptomatic events. What this deluge of posts amounts to is a person having the flu, and talking about how much snot is coming out of their nose, instead of talking about how much bed-rest and chicken soup they should be having. Hundreds of posts about snotty tissues. A handful about the flu itself. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just driving people into an angry disenfranchised frenzy. Which would be more effective? A post with nationwide statistics about police brutality, or one video of a black guy getting beat up by a cop? One is informative, the other just stirs the pot. In the face of statistical context, the video of the guy getting beat up is white noise. And yet we are inundated with these singular cases, which provide no greater context. </p>

<p>They are all appeals to emotion. I do not deny that they deserve to be seen, but in this sub, they do not serve to prove a point. They are just confirmation bias. &quot;See? This is a symptom of the thing I said is happening, so it must be happening!&quot; Even if you&#39;re right, it&#39;s the same techniques used to delude the masses. </p>

<p>We must hold ourselves to a higher standard. We must bring our A-game. This sub used to be a place to seek information, but it has now become a breeding ground for an ideology, and click-bait for blogs to sell more advertisements. You see a lack of censorship, I see an unguided ship. </p>

<p>Sure they are.</p>

<p>But you are talking about a fundamental problem of Reddit. It is a democracy. It is based on votes. That is why the best articles rarely receive a great deal of up-votes. It is not a problem that can be solved by creating a new sub-reddit.</p>

<p>I do not know much about the history of the sub-reddit. I do agree there should be more discussion of the root problems and solutions, that is quite true. I do however realize that Reddit&#39;s format makes certain that articles that discuss such topics will rarely receive much attention -- HOWEVER, discussion of these topics can receive a great deal of attention in comment threads of articles that may at first appear to be merely circle-jerks. The comments are where the real information is spread.</p>

<p>I disagree that the disease or the source of the symptoms are well-known. They largely remain hidden and open to discussion.</p>

<p>I do agree there is a police state. It is a question of how deep the rabbit hole goes, and how far it went in the past.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In my experience that only results in moderators&#39; bias overruling the users&#39; opinion. I see no way that more moderation can help the content of this sub, the ability of the moderators to promote content is limited, all they can do is delete content. And so the only reasonable method is to allow the users to vote to decide what content is appropriate, because only the users can promote (up-vote) material, in most cases, barring stickys for example. Moderation is limited mainly to removing material, which isn&#39;t really needed in this sub - users can down-vote what they please.</p>

<p>Completely wrong, how ignorant are you?</p>

<p>A troll is just a random person looking to get a rise out of people, looking to mess with people for no reason other than their own personal amusement.</p>

<p>A shill is somebody who is pushing an agenda of some sort, or speaking on the behalf of others, all the while not even believing in what agenda or idea or product they are pushing, they are acting as an agent for a different entity.</p>

<p>A troll may be a shill, but straight up shills are not trolls, do not confuse the two.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It affects what submissions users are able to see on the front page of the new cue which is directly affected in a negative manner so as to hide new submissions.</p>

<p>You are straight up wrong, how ignorant are you on how this forum attacking stuff works? Seriously, are you new to the internet and Reddit?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ask yourself: do you ever go to the second or third page of a google search? How do you expect the average user to do the same for the new queue?</p>

<p>This is how people work based on how they have been conditioned which is why they engage in these techniques to keep important content off of the front page, because they know that the average person has been conditioned to look no further than the first 4 results thanks to the google effect of &quot;if it&#39;s not a top result then it&#39;s probably not even good&quot;.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I can absolutely attest to this. I have been suspicious of the voting here for a while and in the last couple weeks have made several posts exposing how the vote manipulation on reddit works. It almost made me decide to just throw my hands up and say &quot;fuck it&quot; and leave this sub for somewhere else. In the end I decided to gather evidence and let people know when topics are being manipulated and votes are being shaved. It seems when people know for sure a topic is being suppressed and upvotes are being kept artificially low they will fight to keep that topic on the front page <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2m6q95/why_does_monsantos_pr_team_get_a_free_pass_on/">like they did the Monsanto shills topic yesterday</a>. Despite having hundreds of upvotes removed it managed to stay on the front page all day yesterday.</p>

<p>You know something is really fishy when there are over 300 comments but only 220 points overall on the topic. </p>

<p>There are other ways the queues are manipulated and presented to users browsing the first couple pages of the main queue, and it really sucks. I wonder if there is a way a sub could just be left alone from the site wide censorship and vote manipulation policy? There should be at least <em>one</em> sub that is omitted from the censorship algorithm and upvote shaving process.</p>

<p>Anyway I am rambling now, I could go on and on about the broken voting here after this last 10 days or so of closely watching reddit vote manipulation. The voting on reddit is an absolute illusion and sham now IMO. I have more evidence than I could possibly post at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re being naive. Whatever is on the first page of the new queue has the highest chance of making it to the top. By submission flooding, you guarantee that your content is the most visible, and thus the most voted upon. A small amount of votes is all it takes to start a snowball effect, as people are more likely to upvote something that has already been upvoted, and to downvote something that has already been downvoted. That&#39;s on top of the low margin of upvotes necessary to make it to the front for this sub. </p>

<p>Reddit doesn&#39;t work off of votes, it works off of visibility and popularity. All you need to do is look at the front page of the sub, and see how a post with less upvotes is placed above a post with more upvotes. </p>

<p>You say that votes solve the problem, but the new queue is the one place where this is not true at all. Submissions are organized by time submitted, not by votes, so it is not at all democratic. This is why the new queue is so important. The very act of submitting so much content removes choice from the average user.</p>

<p>This is why moderation is necessary. A floodgate is needed. If we made it so that users could only submit 1-3 posts per day, then the quality of the sub would increase massively, and each submission would be properly viewed and voted upon. Furthermore, we see the same story submitted from multiple users and from multiple blogs, but they are all the same thing, so we get inundated with redundant content. This is another reason why moderation is necessary. </p>

<p>If you are submitting a large amount of posts, you are contributing to the problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would argue that you wish to control the content as well, by controlling the visibility of posts through mass submission. Is there really so much out there that you can&#39;t get enough said in 3 submissions per day? Or do you need to submit every single article posted on every single alternative news blog?</p>

<p>There&#39;s a word for that, and it&#39;s called karma whoring. Or, click-bait shilling. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example. Citizens United. Unlimited money to political candidates. That money buys air time. That air time increases visibility. That visibility buys votes. The more exposure, the more likely to get voted in. The little guy without any money won&#39;t get elected, because no one knows about him, and they don&#39;t vote for him. He could be the second coming of Christ, and it wouldn&#39;t matter, because no one knows him. This is why Citizens United was bad. Do you disagree?</p>

<p>Because if you agree Citizens United was bad, that it erodes away democracy, link submission flooding is the Reddit equivalent. He who is the most visible is the most powerful. </p>

<p>So you can drop your false indignation, because you haven&#39;t brought a logical counterargument to the table. Prove me wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The guy wants to stop people from posting submissions. There is absolutely no reason to stop people from posting submissions, and the number of posts that are submitted has very little to do with what ends up on the front page because almost every article that&#39;s posted that he wants to censor (like anything and everything to do with Israel which is his real goal to censor) has 1 or 2 net up-votes, while posts that make it to the front tend to have at least 10. If you can&#39;t see what he&#39;s trying to do I can&#39;t make you, but I&#39;m not stupid enough to fall for his shit especially when he&#39;s revealed elsewhere explicitly that he wants to limit posts about Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I&#39;m saying is that there is no reason why a person needs to be posting 10 things a day, every day. And flooding this sub with shit posts <em>is</em> a way to manipulate the content seen on this sub. I think the quality would be increased and more people would be inspired to post things if it were limited to 3 or 5 a day or something. For example, I rarely ever post anything because I think to myself, &quot;This will be buried and/or ignored anyway, what&#39;s the point of even posting it?&quot;</p>

<p>This problem would be limited slightly if there were less overall posts. It would also get people to think more about what they&#39;re submitting instead of just submitting 50 things indiscriminately. Do you see what I&#39;m saying?</p>

<p>If the content is there then that&#39;s obviously the only way to post all the relevant content.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen any users flooding the sub with shit posts.</p>

<p>The only real problem I&#39;ve seen is that some of the same stuff is reposted multiple times. Like the thing about drugs on Mitch McConnell&#39;s relative&#39;s ship or whateva.</p>

<p>I still see no valid reason to prevent people from posting as much as they like. The Reddit platform handles it just fine, as it always has.</p>

<p>Accusing another user of being a troll or shill can be viewed as an attack, depending on context. </p>

<p>According to rule ten, allegations of users being trolls/shills is not automatic grounds for banning.</p>

<p>It CAN be viewed as an attack, depending on context.</p>

<p>If your context actually supports that user being a shill, well then it&#39;s not an attack is it?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I do, and there is nothing in the rules against sending me a PM with a list of users here who you feel are trolls.</p>

<p>Please do PM me a list of users you feel to be trolls, I have a list as well which I have quite a few current users on who appear to be very active in posting a combo of semi-good posts and complete shit posts. I want to see if we view any of the same users as being shills/trolls.</p>

<p>The very act of submitting so much content removes choice from the average user.</p>

<p>A basic information control method employed by these users submitting too many submissions.</p>

<p>This is why moderation is necessary. A floodgate is needed.</p>

<p>I agree entirely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we made it so that users could only submit 1-3 posts per day, then the quality of the sub would increase massively, and each submission would be properly viewed and voted upon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again I agree, this seems to be the most logical solution.</p>

<p>It will not solve the problem entirely as users will just use multiple accounts, but it will at least require that further effort which will be too much for some, so it will stop those users at least.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, we see the same story submitted from multiple users and from multiple blogs, but they are all the same thing, so we get inundated with redundant content. This is another reason why moderation is necessary.</p>

<p>Yes, the absurdity of the nature of many reposts is just too much to handle.</p>

<p>I actually like this idea.  No extra moderation/deletion, just limits on how many posts a user can make.  This would increase the quality of the sub as well as making it easier to spot those posts that are being obviously manipulated (since there would be less total posts to sift through).</p>

<p>Hmm... I&#39;d actually like to have that implemented and see how it works out.</p>
