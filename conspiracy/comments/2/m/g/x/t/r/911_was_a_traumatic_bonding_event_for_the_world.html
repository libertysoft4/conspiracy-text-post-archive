    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t react to 9/11 simultaneously with other Americans as it played out that day on television. I was out of the country and away from television and internet. I heard about it on foreign radio but wasn&#39;t exposed to the video til days later. My first reaction was that people would be angry at the government and military for not defending New York (where I lived back then) and that the public would demand heads. When I returned to the States after the flying restrictions were lifted, all I saw was flag waving and desire for revenge against the outsiders. It all looked orchestrated to me. My initial questions about why the largest and most important city in the country was not adequately defended was never asked in the media, all questions apparently swept away by the flood of patriotism. I felt out of step with my countrymen, but no one wanted to look at it that way. When I brought up the question about the lack of planning for an air raid on New York, why weren&#39;t the planes intercepted, why weren&#39;t cockpit doors locked, people told me to support the president and military like everyone else and stop being anti American.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well when one of the planes didn&#39;t reach its likely destination (WTC 7) that was a goof.</p>

<p>Also, the fact they bombarded us with Bin Laden&#39;s face almost immediately, that was really obvious too.</p>

<p>And then they flew his family out of the country.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t exactly &quot;awake&quot; when 9/11 occurred, but I wasn&#39;t an idiot.</p>

<p>I remember reading something about some sort of &quot;energy&quot; surge detected <em>before</em> the actual event...like earlier that day or something.</p>

<p>Does that ring a bell for anyone?</p>

<p>Also, three buildings just vanished in front of our eyes. </p>

<p>For those in the know, it seems 9/11 was a debut of a type of <em>technology</em> as well as an event to usher in the &quot;New World Order.&quot;</p>

<p>It was also an occult &quot;mega ritual&quot; type event, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14utv0/911_was_an_occult_megaritual_the_numbers_of_the_4/">with the numbers of the flights and the actual floors where they impacted</a> having occult significance.</p>

<p>9/11 was a test, the ultimate divide and conquer strategy.</p>

<p>Part of the population was traumatized because of how blatantly obvious the lies were, and they simply shut down and became more complacent in their cognitive dissonance.</p>

<p>The other part of the population was also traumatized, but this time it&#39;s because they <em>recognized</em> those lies and could see just how extensively we&#39;ve been deceived.</p>

<p>The ripples of the 9/11 psyop will continue to echo until the perpetrators are exposed and the technology that was used is disclosed and put to humanity&#39;s benefit.</p>

<p>They made so many mistakes and were very careless and over confident.  Still it doesn&#39;t seem to matter much whether it came out eventually - the damage would be done quickly.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ukraine woke me up. They had to lie so hard to cover up the coup that it wasn&#39;t logically consistent with the evidence.</p>

<p>Then JFK&#39;s assassination made sense. Then 9/11 made sense. And that&#39;s the tip of the iceberg. It&#39;s the implications that are really mind-blowing.</p>

<p>use Bing and its &#39;similar image&#39; feature, find the high resolutions photos of MH17 wreckage, zoom in and look closely. fake photos or what. why so much photoshop with <em>documentary</em> news photos !?</p>

<p>there were a selection of photos of day two, where a group of twenty or so photojournalists were taken on a tour by the hooded mercs, the fototjournalists took a few self photos (of the group).</p>

<p>the same hooded mercs supposedly &#39;Russian&#39; were also photographed with the OESC people at the train station in Ukrainian territory. the same train station where the bodies were spirited off to, the Russian rebels have no train tracks.</p>
