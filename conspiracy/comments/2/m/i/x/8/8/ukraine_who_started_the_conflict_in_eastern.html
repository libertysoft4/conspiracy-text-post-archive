        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been collecting news for months now and decided to lay it out in chronological order for people who would like to know what&#39;s going on in Ukraine. 
I&#39;ve bolded the most interesting and important documentaries and news pieces.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The west and many opposition parties did not like Yanukovich since he was very pro-Russian. </p></li>
<li><p>These anti-Yanukovych people started &quot;maidan&quot; (a big demonstration on &quot;Maidan Nezalezhnosti&quot; - a large square in downtown Kiev). No matter that there was an election coming up soon...</p></li>
<li><p>Maidan was sponsored by the west since they wanted to put a pro-western person in power. </p>

</ul></li>
<li><p>Maidan is composed of a lot of neo nazis and fascist types. Not that regular Ukrainian people weren&#39;t involved, they were at a later stage, but most of the violence and early groundwork was done by these western sponsored groups. </p>

<ul>
<li>The real face of Ukraine’s Maidan “democrats” <a href="http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2014/03/28/sect-m28.html">http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2014/03/28/sect-m28.html</a></li>

</ul></li>
<li><p>The people controlling maidan wanted more Ukrainians on their side so they started to agitate the riot police so that the riot police would get violent and start attacking protesters. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Maidan Massacre: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nxCGWhHP-Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nxCGWhHP-Y</a></strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>After maidaners start killing police, the police start shooting at the ones who have weapons. The bought and paid for media then portrays this as the Yanukovych government killing innocent civilians.</p>

<ul>
<li>Provocateurs hired by the opposition attack maidaners to make it seem like the police is doing so in order to rile up the crowds and get people angry against the police.</li>
<li>The shooters from Maidan are most likely a provocation: <a href="http://nsnbc.me/2014/03/05/busted-leaked-phone-tape-eus-ashton-reveals-kiev-snipers-hired-maidan-leaders/">http://nsnbc.me/2014/03/05/busted-leaked-phone-tape-eus-ashton-reveals-kiev-snipers-hired-maidan-leaders/</a></li>

</ul></li>
<li><p>More Ukrainians get riled up and angry at the police and the Yanukovych government and more of them begin to support Maidan.</p>

<li><p>Maidaners start occupying government buildings, attacking police, throwing molotovs, etc. </p>

<li>Yanukovych gets scared and runs away to Russia. President has now been toppled.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Putin sees that a pro-western power has taken over Ukraine, and he knows they will want to put military bases into Crimea because it is a very strategic point. So he says fuck that shit and gets Crimea to hold a referendum to get out of Ukraine. Now many people will say that he invaded Ukraine and &quot;took&quot; crimea. Crimea wanted out of Ukraine back in 1991. Crimea also has the most Russian speakers out of all of Ukraine. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_sovereignty_referendum,_1991">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_sovereignty_referendum,_1991</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_referendum,_1994">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_referendum,_1994</a></li>
<li>During those 90&#39;s referendums, Ukraine didn&#39;t let Crimea separate. So what Putin did was literally bring democracy to Crimea and let them vote to get the hell out of Ukraine. </li>
<li>People say that Putin invaded, the green men, but what they forget was that there already were already 16,000 Russian soldiers in Crimea. Who&#39;ve been there for 15 years. <a href="http://rt.com/news/russian-troops-crimea-ukraine-816/">http://rt.com/news/russian-troops-crimea-ukraine-816/</a> Obviously this doesn&#39;t justify an invasion or war, but they didn&#39;t invade anyone. They just walked out from their bases to help the Crimeans hold a referendum without any intrusions or provocations.</li>
<li>This gives fuel to the Ukrainians and maidaners - PUTIN HAS INVADED!!! And so the propaganda machine starts. &quot;Russia is at war with Ukraine!&quot;</li>
<li>The east of the country: Donetsk and Luhansk regions are very pro-russia. Many people there consider themselves Russians. They obviously don&#39;t agree with this toppling of a democratically elected president, They themselves started their own demonstrations against the Kiev maidan and then against this new pro-western anti-russian leader who toppled a president they voted for.</li>
<li>The new people in power in Ukraines government use a lot of fascists/skinheads to do their bidding, so they send them to try  disrupt these new pro-russian movements and demonstrations starting up in the east of the country. The new government obviously don&#39;t want to get toppled like they just did to Yanukovych. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>March and April 2014:</p>

<ul>
<li>100,000 people march against the new Ukrainian government. against USA involvement and for Russia: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HYcJJFddI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HYcJJFddI</a></li>
<li>Right sector fascist skinhead types went to Kharkov to try to take city hall. They were captured: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa63IjsaWIk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa63IjsaWIk</a>  (Again this could also be a provocation by the Ukrainian government. They send in these people who take over government buildings, the government then says &quot;Oh look, terrorists are in government buildings, lets send in the army&quot;)</li>
<li>Huge fights break out in Eastern Ukraine between the pro-Russian people and the maidan/skinheads/right sector people: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPogEfsfsH8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPogEfsfsH8</a></li>
<li>Ultra-national right sector terrorizing Dnepropetrovsk: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwnwOk2pNs8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwnwOk2pNs8</a></li>
<li>Skinheads beating up a television studio manager: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBD42RxlS9I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBD42RxlS9I</a></li>
<li>Right sector skinheads beat up an opposition party member - right inside the duma (like the Senate in the US) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5FW4xirM48">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5FW4xirM48</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The skinheads and fascist anti-Russian people then  burn people alive in Odessa. The whole Odessa massacre was basically a false flag provocation. They made it look like pro-Russian people caused violence, when it was the pro-Ukrainian neo nazis and fascists that did so:</p>

<ul>
<li>Odessa Massacre was caused by a provocation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxRxdF3xp-U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxRxdF3xp-U</a></li>
<li><strong>The Odessa Massacre - What REALLY Happened <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4dJRnI-X8Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4dJRnI-X8Q</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>Independent report on massacre in Odessa <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yflMScowPfk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yflMScowPfk</a></strong></li>
<li>New Ukrainian government agent committing atrocities against pro-Russians in Odessa: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTAGcV6_o1w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTAGcV6_o1w</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMGPt2YMtU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqMGPt2YMtU</a> (the neo nazis even beat up firefighters so they couldn&#39;t go and put out the fire)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>People in the eastern part of the country see this new government and these rogue groups burning people alive, causing chaos in their country and understandably are pretty upset. They also begin to occupy government buildings and give a big fuck you to the new government.  The new government now gets really angry and sends in the actual army to go kill these civilians. Here are videos about that: Early may 2014: </p>

<ul>
<li>Ukrainian government forces killing civilians: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ6rLgnRv8Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ6rLgnRv8Q</a></li>
<li>More Ukrainian army killing civilians: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnPWrIr8LiE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnPWrIr8LiE</a></li>
<li>Bloody may 9 Mariupol: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-GiuwxrVDo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-GiuwxrVDo</a></li>
<li>Civilians blocking Ukrainian tanks in Mariupol and telling them to go home: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAG5TCW7QCU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAG5TCW7QCU</a></li>
<li> <strong>Large compilation of videos of the new Ukraine government starting killing civillians:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3MOEC5wL7U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3MOEC5wL7U</a></li>
<li>The civilians take up arms, begin organizing en masse and begin to fight back against the Ukrainian army by shooting down their helicopters and planes. The western media begins to call these people &quot;Russian soldiers&quot;. What they forget is that there is mandatory conscription in Ukraine. All males know how to shoot guns, and many know how to use RPGs, anti air rockets, tanks/btrs and other military assets. Where did they get their equipment? Army bases all over eastern Ukraine. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>It is now full on panic mode in Ukraine. These eastern Ukrainians are now called &quot;Terrorists&quot; because they are defending themselves from an army that wants to kill them for expressing their views.</p></li>
<li><p>When Maidan started, the maidaners were against the current government, they killed police, disrupted the city, occupied government buildings, and the Ukrainian people and the media were with them and cheered them on. When the East of the country did the same, when they said they don&#39;t want the current government, when they occupied government buildings; they were murdered, burned and hated on by the rest of the country while being called terrorists. You tell me if that makes sense.</p>

<ul>
<li>June 2: The new ukrainian government attacks civilians from an airplane: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bwLMw4138U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bwLMw4138U</a></li>

</ul></li>
<li><p>And that&#39;s basically the start of it. The ukrainian government uses Fascist neo nazi punitive batallions.</p>

<p>What shouldn&#39;t be forgotten is the admirable struggle that the Ukrainian people went through to achieve their revolution. I&#39;ve never seen a people so steadfast in their convictions and determination to see change in their leadership. Conspiracy theories only belittle the actual work and sacrifice made by those people, from simple minded people who only see their worldview in every single event.</p>

<p>It was a People&#39;s Revolution!!!</p>

<p>Your hypocrisy is showing. Funny how every conflict, since Afghanistan, Russia has only defended their civilians and military bases (Georgia + Crimea). Can the West say the same?  </p>

<p>Somehow people don&#39;t see that insidious subversive tactics backed by a small but effective physical presence to topple a duly elected government (which is exactly what the &#39;West&#39; did in Ukraine) constitutes an invasion. Is it really so hard to understand this tactic that has been used by the US to gain effective control over the markets of foreign countries for decades? The lack of insight into these matters within the general population frustrates me to no end. I guess propaganda works.   </p>

<p>One thing that we have seen in the last eight years of Mr. Putin’s presidency is his great support fighting for the Jewish community against anti-semitism. No other president in the world has come out so forcefully in such a radical way against 
anti-semitism.</p>

<p>Jews are a key part of the NWO. Putin is a Jew himself. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTnHcHsUNM0">So was Hitler.</a> When you know about the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130103231509/http://zioncrimefactory.com/jew-world-order/">JWO</a> you tend not to trust Jews. Fool me once, shame on you, and all that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because Russia saying they&#39;re anti-fascist and interested in protecting Judaism has no historical meaning, right?   Completely coincidental that millions of Jews fled to eastern Europe from German and Ukrainian Fascist? Where Jews held one of their biggest demographics before Israel, in Russia  </p>

<p>What&#39;s next, are we going to blame the collapse of the USSR on the Jews for leaving Russia for Israel? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, because millions of Russian solders left the battle fields of WW1 due to Jewish commands? Not by their own accord?</p>

<p>Do you know how the revolution began? Or do you simply think because Lenin had Jewish supporters, he&#39;s a NWO leader? Have a news flash for you. Bolsheviks didn&#39;t start the revolution. Lenin wasn&#39;t even in Russia when it began. </p>

<p>And if you think Stalin was a NWO conspirator, that&#39;s cute. </p>

<p>I&#39;m all for crazy tin foil hat theories. But if you&#39;re saying WW1 was orchestrated by NWO Jews to simply cause a Russian revolution a few years later by more NWO Jews, they either thought too hard or something went wrong. Russian politics and their economy was not that stable to begin with. Why start a global war just to break an already crippled country that can hardly defend themselves against the Japanese? Doesn&#39;t make sense. Unless the war had other intentions. </p>

<p>Not simply, but that was obviously part of it.</p>
