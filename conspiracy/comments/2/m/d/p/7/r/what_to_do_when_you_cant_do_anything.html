        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>What can we do?</strong></p>

<p>The question on everyone’s mind. First, I&#39;d say no one can tell you WHAT to do. Second, I think a general, rough, decentralized, leaderless, &quot;plan&quot; everyone can follow their way with their own skills, but that moves us in the same direction, is a good place to look for a &quot;solution&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>The elevator pitch</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>If dollars are power, why do we spend them so freely?</li>
<li>Disengage the thieves&#39; economy on all non-essential functions.</li>
<li>Deploy capital today on solutions for tomorrow that require no dollar inputs.</li>
<li>Spend free-time with loved ones while pursuing quality of life improving goals.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Some details</strong></p>

<p>Every day we pursue a lifestyle that revolves around spending. We go out to eat, see movies, play video games, buy cars, houses, talk on the phones, etc. All of the &quot;middle-class&quot; stuff. These very purchases are what fuels the very corporations (and government which it has corrupted) that most everyone complains about. </p>

<p>While you need a roof over your head and food in your belly, do you really NEED all of the other stuff? We spend so many hours &quot;making money&quot; while complaining about the destruction of the family unit - in the name of &quot;paying the bills&quot; or &quot;putting food on the table&quot;. While there are certainly those in such dire a position that all their money goes to living, many more are living with a lot more niceties than necessities. Would not you rather swap the amount time you  spend at your JOB with the time you spend with your LOVED ONES? Of course there is no &quot;career path&quot; that would support this thinking...</p>

<p>If we stop paying for all that middle-class crap and start instead  investing in ourselves (sounds cheesy, but it is true), maybe we could build a better life directly, instead of trying to buy one. A simple example of how you could redirect dollars would be to install a garden and/or orchard. You&#39;d be spending dollars and labor to put them in today, but in the future you&#39;d get dollar-free fruits (You&#39;ll need to labor yearly for them though, compost/trim/harvest - see permaculture for details).</p>

<p>If enough people installed gardens, we could bankrupt companies like Monsanto. Every dollar in food you grow is a dollar less that fuels this corruption.</p>

<p>Remember SOPA from a few year back? GoDaddy backed SOPA and reddit started a boycott on GoDaddy. People made &quot;How to Transfer Away from GoDaddy&quot; sites with simple instructions so non-tech people (GoDaddy&#39;s audience) could move to better solutions. What happened? GoDaddy quickly changed their tune, condemning SOPA, (a lie no doubt) the second their bottom line was threatened. Money talks, bullshit walks.</p>

<p>These are just simple examples. Everyone has specific problems in their lives they pay to fix. Find a way to fix it yourself - cut out the middle men. </p>

<p>My neighbor, a handy guy, was about to call the furnace repair guy a month ago when his furnace didn&#39;t come on. I pushed him to investigate it further and he had it working for under $20 and a few hours research online. He was beaming about his accomplishment all day (and little did he know, he sapped the money masters)!</p>

<p>Lastly, with all the time that you aren&#39;t shopping or sitting in front of the
YouTube (your time is more valuable than your dollar) you can now spend an increased amount of time with loved ones. Continue working together as a family/community to keep solving problems without dollars.</p>

<p>Maybe we can start this holiday season? What if a lot of us decided that we&#39;d rather spend the whole holiday with our loved ones and not spend any time or money shopping?</p>

<p><strong>I&#39;m already broke/unemployed!</strong></p>

<p>Time is your capital. You can learn online how to do so many things. I
mentioned permaculture before, but places like Khan Academy,  MIT Open Courseware, The Teaching Company, Gutenberg, bittorrent, and even YouTube have a load of educational material on anything you might be interested in. Forget a college degree, learn something and do it. Build a portfolio to show yourself off if it isn&#39;t something you can do alone.</p>

<p>You&#39;d also better know how to cook and be in good shape.</p>

<p><strong>Ideal Results</strong></p>

<p>As people stop participating in the thieves&#39; economy, big businesses will start to go broke. There may be government intervention/bail-outs, but there could never be a law forcing you to purchase without revealing the emperor has no clothes. As more companies go broke, people will be out of JOBS (don&#39;t worry, there is PLENTY of WORK to be done). Less economic activity. Basically a depression. </p>

<p>The world is moving away from the dollar already and this will probably play out over a long grind, but I suggest we pull the rug out from under &quot;the eCONomy&quot; today and take our pain, sort of like pulling off a band-aid quickly.</p>

<p>Yes, I suspect there will be extreme unpleasantness, but from this mother, innovation will rise. How many young people are wasting their lives away with MEDIA? What could they do in a real market? You hear about small farms and small business being bullied out of existence all the time. These are the people who are willing to put up with all the regulations. How many more would love to start a small business/farm but can&#39;t because of artificial barriers to entry?</p>

<p>Oh, what if it were OK to sell canned vegetables or run a small restaurant out of your kitchen? What if we didn&#39;t need a permit to handle used tires or accept waste human food (that you might use to feed animals or process into fuel/compost)? Communities taking care of each others&#39; best interests without the need for permits...</p>

<p>Removing the &quot;elites&#39;&quot; hold on global trade is the only way to even think about loosening their influence. Well, I can think of another, deadlier, way, but that almost assures a new set of &quot;kings&quot;. Plus who are the right heads to remove? Gov? lackeys. Fed? Primary dealers? lackeys. BIS? closer, but lackeys. Further still, if you aren&#39;t willing to give up your Netflix, do you really think you are going to revolt?</p>

<p><strong>Why not organize</strong></p>

<p>The Tea Party and Occupy Wall street are perfect example of how any kind of protest/march will not work. While both organizations had perfectly reasonable &quot;demands&quot; (gov spending reduction/money out of politics), they were spun by the media as gun-toting redneck idiots and hippies shitting up the park. Next some agent provocateurs get the &quot;movement&quot; some bad publicity and our fickle not-paying-attention public is swayed.</p>

<p>Movements like this would likely be more effective if the economy was in
shambles and the television couldn&#39;t explain the people&#39;s frustrations away.</p>

<p><strong>Global and domestic</strong></p>

<p>This was written for those in the USA of course. Anyone outside the USA can help by not buying the same stuff mentioned above. From what I see Hollywood and Wall Street have a pretty nice income from their non-domestic operations. Not to mention Lockheed and Boeing. Although the latter are often out of the public&#39;s hands.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong></p>

<p>GENERAL BOYCOTT on anything that doesn&#39;t improve the quality of your life and reduce your reliance on dollars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You got the right idea, bud. I&#39;ve started hobbies where the waste products are starting to fuel other hobbies (for example, I make homemade soup on the weekends to bring to work and in the process of making chicken and beef stock I noticed a buildup of far more tallow than I could cook with - so now it&#39;s used to make soap on an extremely small scale <em>for now</em>. Eventually spent grain from all-grain brewing will go toward baking bread. I&#39;ve tried to map up things that I enjoy (home cooked meals, victory gardens, and beer as a start) and turn them into hobbies that at least somewhat support each other). This month&#39;s project is a HAM-radio cert (but that&#39;s more for fun and possible networking in the future, so it does have an end-game goal in mind. Maybe I can start my Mesh when it warms up).</p>

<p>If you could multiply this strategy on a larger scale, you could possibly mesh a network of people to get her who have different degrees in expertise in various subjects and disciplines, you could build your own community, or at least a more supportive one.</p>

<p>But one of your first points I feel is by far the most important: take care of your body and mind, which will translate to a more positive experience for you and all those around you. How can you expect to be free of the petrodollar if you need petrodollars to pay for your high blood pressure medication? Get yourself right, at your own pace, but take care of yourself first. Move more, eat less. Try and eat as local as possible whenever possible, and if meat&#39;s your thing, try and not support factory farming. Focusing on building relationships with local farmers and producers is the best way of getting <em>out there</em> while simultaneously detaching from a lot of the &quot;middle class bullshit&quot; (I love this by the way) we have been sold to sell and buy.</p>

<p>Great Sat morning post - and I wish you the best of luck.</p>

<p>If anyone wants to talk more about the self-sustaining hobby idea, I&#39;m all ears.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think working on yourself, enjoying life, enjoyed friends and loved ones, is very important. It&#39;s easy to become very negative and not take care of yourself when you&#39;re focusing on all the evil in the world. I also think improving ones spirituality is key, as the occult &quot;elite&quot; are trying to keep us from being spiritual, they want to keep us confined to the material, limited, ignorant.</p>

<p>On the other hand, even though it often seems futile, I enjoy spreading the truth to others so that they may have the opportunity to learn and know, and I think this is a worthwhile pursuit in a world where it seems like you can&#39;t do anything about the evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with most of what you say. I like the idea of working less to spend time on what matters and avoiding consumerism. While I emphatically encourage a DIY spirit, I hardly think the local mr. fixit is a money master though..</p>

<p>The problem is that your approach(which is pretty close to my solution as well) is that right now it still would appear as withdrawing from society to the common american animal. Consumption is the herd tendency, it is &quot;easy&quot; and it is backed by popular opinion. Homesteading and things like that are challenging and require a complete human, wisdom and intelligence and a willingness to carve ones own path. This doesn&#39;t apply to most of the country and for now I think this type of response will remain niche. Hopefully enough of the down trodden wake up and put their frustrations to good use but for now I think you&#39;re probably ahead of the trends by about a decade. How frustratingly hilarious it is that the changes you propose need to happen NOW instead of in response to an even worse situation when it&#39;ll be too late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, you&#39;ve got to get the hooks the credit system has on you out of your mind.  I owe student loands and have the lowest credit rating, but it does not affect my self worth or self image, it only affects the kind of things I own and how difficult I am for debt collectors to find.  I didn&#39;t file tax returns the last 2 years and won&#39;t this year either, I will resist paying it and force them to expend resources to track me down.  </p>

<p>Anything that needs to know my social security number before doing business with me is part of the evil system.  Doctors who require insurance.  Asking me for my social security number is like telling me you have no idea what is going on and that you are trapped in the fantasy world of fake currency.  </p>

<p>I have chosen to invest in durable goods and a lot of easily transportable gear that would immediately skyrocket in value the minute the system collapsed.  I take it as a given the entire thing could crumble at any moment.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.</p>

<p>I spent years figuring out what was wrong and always felt bad when people would reflexively ask me what one can do to solve these problems. Only recently has the concept of disengagement been on my mind. Agorism / voluntaryism / anarchism. Basically no one owns you and you get to make your own choices.</p>

<p>Obviously it&#39;s better if you can do a job yourself instead of paying someone to do it for you. But if you have a job you really can&#39;t do by yourself, what about those local business owners who make a living off their trade? People like mechanics, plumbers, etc need money as well. Maybe your guidelines could be changed so that people should support local business instead of franchises. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep your eyes open for trash. There is a never ending supply. Millions if not billions of dollars of stuff goes into the trash yearly. Salvage can be fun, it&#39;s practical skill you don&#39;t really learn in many schools. The &quot;recyclers&quot; really do not do much except dispose of dangerous materials in a safe way.

    <div class="md"><p>i like the idea of community gardens, altho&#39; it may be difficult living in a colder clime, if i could afford it i would have a small green house,</p>

<p>i think ppl <em>should</em> not &#39;buy&#39; into the spending hype on holidays, i think it is up the the parents to inform their children (when they are young) about the true meaning of giving.  People have been programmed to automatically purchase things, and needlessly go into debt.</p>

<p>perhaps this year will be somewhat different, many are complaining about the price of food, &amp; not having a job or not making enough money on their job.</p>

<p>with all the stress put upon us, i agree with OP, stay healthy, stay focused, stay safe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought about what I would do in their position (People living in the U.S). It&#39;s not hard to decide a gathering place, where they&#39;ll be able to see if there&#39;s enough people for it to work. If not, then they can return back to where they came from and not engage the police. The problem however, is that if people take their guns and storm the administration centers, police stations, ect, then it&#39;s going to be a slaughter.</p>

<p>But if they don&#39;t do it, how likely is it that they&#39;ll die anyway? Even if they give up their guns? If you&#39;d rather avoid this, then you could simply leave the country. Those are you&#39;re two options.﻿</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m gonna take on the federal government all by myself, working within their unjust system of the courts. Perhaps I&#39;m going to claim I&#39;m a sovereign citizen, and then they&#39;ll put me in the loony bin. Sounds like a stupendous plan.</p>
