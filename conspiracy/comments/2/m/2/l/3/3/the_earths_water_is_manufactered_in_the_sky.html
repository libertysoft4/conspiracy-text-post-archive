<p>Hydrogen + Oxygen + Energy = Water</p>

<p>It couldn&#39;t get any simpler. Recent discoveries about atmospheric lighting which extends way up into the stratosphere, terrestrial gamma ray flashes, and an Ozone layer that seems to keep replenishing itself, no matter what we throw at it.</p>

<p>So, do you still believe that the water for the Earth comes from ice comets?</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve never seen, which there is good chance you are oblivious to these phenomenon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You didn&#39;t provide anything about how such water would be produced.  </p>

<p>Just because one thing is produced here doesn&#39;t mean everything can be produced here.  </p>

<p>Atmospheric lighting was predicted based on current knowledge we had back in the 1920&#39;s.  It isn&#39;t a new phenomena nor does it defy current scientific knowledge.  </p>

<p>Terrestrial gamma ray flashes are interesting, but are still not anything special that defies scientific understand of the earth.  Consensus appears to be that it is photons and electrons emitted from a storm creating the electrical field colliding with air molecules and other molecules in the atmosphere at high speeds.   </p>

<p>The ozone layer we already knew would replenish itself if we stopped putting cfc&#39;s into the air.  It was predicted, and they were correct.  Another known natural process. </p>

<p>All these things sit within the realm of known science and what current scientific knowledge allows for.  What you are saying sits outside that realm.  Without new evidence, there is nothing that indicates that water can be readily produced on the earth by its own natural processes.  Not to say we won&#39;t find that data at some point, or that it is impossible, only that we do not have anything to say it does.  And pointing out things that happen that are odd, is not evidence for it. </p>

<p>So yes, I still believe water came from comets early on, or possibly formed during the earlier years of our planets evolution through as yet undiscovered processes.  I do not believe we are currently making water on earth.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Upper Atmospheric Lightning. It&#39;s entirely new.</p>

<p>However, yeah, I&#39;m willing to believe that weather modification technology works because it was known by some before hand.</p>

<p><strong>Earth&#39;s water probably didn&#39;t come from comets, Caltech researchers say</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news008.html">http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news008.html</a></p>

<p><em>PASADENA -- A new Caltech study of comet Hale-Bopp suggests that comets did not give Earth its water, buttressing other recent studies but contrary to the longstanding belief of many planetary scientists.</em></p>

<p><em>In the March 18 issue of Nature, cosmochemist Geoff Blake and his team show that Hale-Bopp contains sizable amounts of &quot;heavy water,&quot; which contains a heavier isotope of hydrogen called deuterium.</em></p>

<p><em>Thus, if Hale-Bopp is a typical comet, and if comets indeed gave Earth its water supply billions of years ago, then the oceans should have roughly the same amount of deuterium as comets. In fact, the oceans have significantly less.</em></p>

<p>As for whether or not you believe it is currently being made. You only need to look to the Aurora Borealis and noctilucent clouds.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noctilucent_cloud">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noctilucent_cloud</a></p>

<p>Smell the air the next time it rains. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone</a></p>

<p><em>In appropriate contexts, ozone can be viewed as trioxidane with two hydrogen atoms removed, and as such, trioxidanylidene may be used as a context-specific systematic name, according to substitutive nomenclature.</em></p>

<p>That&#39;s two hydrogens to pair up with some oxygen somewhere down the line.</p>

<p>Weather technology is one thing.  Natural earth processes of creating water is something else entirely.  It would be fascinating if evidence was found to support this idea.  </p>

<p>Now, if you would be so kind as to provide any basis whatsoever for your idea that water originated on earth.  That is how you discuss issues.  You make a claim, you provide the evidence for why you believe that, and we discuss.  You don&#39;t make a claim out of no where and expect people to accept the claim of someone on reddit out of hand. </p>

<p><strong>Earth&#39;s water brewed at home, not in space</strong></p>

<p><em>But now planetary scientists in Japan suggest the oceans were actually &quot;home-grown&quot; - they may have formed because the young Earth had a thick blanket of hydrogen, which reacted with oxides in the Earth&#39;s mantle to form lakes and seas.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Water is essential for the origin and evolution of life,&quot; says Hidenori Genda from the Tokyo Institute of Technology. &quot;Why does water exist on Earth, where did it come from? These are fundamental questions for human beings.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>Scientists believe that just after the Earth formed, it was very hot and dry. Theory also suggests that millions of water-rich comets and asteroids bombarded our planet around 3.8 billion years ago, neatly explaining why oceans later appeared.</em></p>

<p><em>What&#39;s more, the ratio of deuterium - or &quot;heavy hydrogen&quot; because it contains a neutron in addition to a proton - to hydrogen in our sea water matches the value found in water-rich asteroids, suggesting a common origin.</em></p>

<p><em>But Genda and his colleague Masahiro Ikoma suggest another possibility. They say the Earth could have had a thick atmosphere of hydrogen, which reacted with oxides in the Earth&#39;s mantle to produce copious water.</em></p>

<p>But at least be honest.  I was responding to your posts.  I didn&#39;t go back and see you edited almost everyone of them to include the links I was asking for.  Everyone can see by the little star that you edited your posts and responses.  Every single one I responded to in my inbox had no links.  It is bullshit to add them later then claim I&#39;m just not watching them and I&#39;m ignoring them.  Its not true, thats a bullshit way to do things.  I&#39;m enjoying the video&#39;s now.  I never crapped on your theorys because you didn&#39;t have anything to crap on.  Like I said I find the idea fascinating, but at the time I said that, there was literally nothing but you saying something.  Nothing.  Now there is.  Thank you.  Its what I&#39;ve been hoping to get.  So far, its very interesting and raises some good questions. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll explain it to you, since you seem to be well versed in the art of crowd persuasion.</p>

<p>A hypothesis is nothing more than something waiting to be proven. It is different than physical proven phenomenon video taped by cameras. BTW. 1994 is new. This hypothesis is relatively new. There is no hot of the presses measurement that one can accurately gauge the freshness of these ideas. Which are totally based in the laws of chemistry, btw.</p>

<p>Weather prediction at it is, isn&#39;t accurate. There is no way you could measure this for accuracy. You can observe and wonder.</p>

<p>What else do you want from me?</p>

<p><strong>ACID CLOUDS AND LIGHTNING</strong></p>

<p><em>At around 60 kilometres altitude is a very thick cloud layer – a 20 kilometre-deep blanket surrounding the planet. It marks the limit between Venus’s lower and middle atmospheric layers. It is this yellowish layer that prevented for a long time Earth-based observatories and previous orbiter missions to see through.</em></p>

<p>These are the physics that build planets and their ecosystems.</p>

<p>There are no comets shaping the surface of Venus differently when compared to Earth. It&#39;s crazy nonsense to even entertain the comet theory building the water supply on Earth.</p>

<p>Atmospheric lighting was predicted based on current knowledge we had back in the 1920&#39;s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Somewhat, here&#39;s what it says on Wikipedia:</p>

<p>In ensuing decades, high altitude electrical discharges were reported by aircraft pilots and discounted by meteorologists until the first direct visual evidence was documented in 1989.</p>

<p>So apparently meteorologists are such idiots that they just said &quot;uh-huh, sure.&quot; to people reporting what should have been well known natural phenomena. They literally didn&#39;t listen until they saw visual proof, so that should tell you how &quot;smart&quot; those people are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ozone layer we already knew would replenish itself if we stopped putting cfc&#39;s into the air. It was predicted, and they were correct. Another known natural process. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which should further show to people that the Earth was designed to heal itself, just like the human body.</p>

<p>Just like the human body, it is unable to repair itself in certain ways when we do certain forms of irreparable damage to it such as blowing up mountain tops and caves and sink holes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Without new evidence, there is nothing that indicates that water can be readily produced on the earth by its own natural processes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps we should be doing this research then to ensure that we will never run out of water by ensuring the Earth always has the proper conditions to create it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So yes, I still believe water came from comets early on, or possibly formed during the earlier years of our planets evolution through as yet undiscovered processes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not believe that, as it is unproven and based on speculative observational research.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll believe it once they can prove it through a working model.</p>

<p>I see right through that bullshit every single time they try it.</p>

<p>I NEVER accepted their bullshit idea because I ALWAYS knew they have no evidence to support it, I never forgot, just like 9/11 being an inside job.</p>

<p>This is why I do not believe their macro-evolution theories, I have been presented absolutely zero solid evidence which confirms their theory of the evolution of the Giraffe, which is the most insane bullshit I&#39;ve ever heard in my entire life.</p>

<p>I have never been shown an actual explanation as to which animal it supposedly came from, how it went about deciding to evolve its&#39; neck to grow taller with the trees rather than just going to lower trees which is more logical, and how all of those structures evolved into their new structures.</p>

<p>I refuse to believe that which can&#39;t be explained but is still presented as fact, that&#39;s what I call bullshit.</p>

<p>That is the conspiracy, that the current &quot;scientific&quot; explanation of &quot;Water PROBABLY came from comets, even though we can&#39;t actually prove it&quot; is just that, unprovable probably wrong bullshit.</p>

<p>Again, this would be far from the first time where &quot;science&quot; has had to go back and re-update the theory with the actual correct information.</p>

<p>They used to think that stars were thermo-nuclear reactors, but they&#39;re not, they&#39;re spheres of plasma formed from gas and other space matter.</p>

<p>Most of these stars also emit radio frequencies and electromagnetic waves, which wasn&#39;t discovered until 1967.</p>

<p>So yes, this is a conspiracy in that the scientific community may very well be bullshitting with their THEORY on how water formed on Earth.</p>
