<p>I don&#39;t want the United States federal government to do anything else. They have done enough harm to the world already. The best way to curb fossil fuel consumption would be to give them <em>less</em> money, not more. </p>

<p>Or, maybe, to cut back on the stupid government sanctioned subsidies for non-renewable resources, and instead reallocate that wasteful spending towards renewable energy subsidies. That way you create more jobs in the renewable energy sector, cut back on pollution, and curb the contribution of man made carbon dioxide poolution. Also, cut the umbilical between OPEC and the auto industry, and allow for cars with 100+ MPGs to be manufactured. This is already a thing, but super efficient cars cuts into OPEC nations profits. </p>

<p>I bet there are over a dozen things, easy things, that can be done to better curb our pollution. For fucks sake, if we are talking about <em>cleaning</em> up our pollution, let that be a community service program designed to help illegal aliens with no prior violent convictions to expedite their nationalization. That would help the immigration process, it woukd lower the already stressed judicial services, and would clean up our nation all at the same time, all without spending absurd amount of extra money.</p>

<p>As with a lot of things, the solutions are simple, and easily obtainable. But, TPTB dont want the general population in on this secret because then they wouldnt be ablebtobjustify their extra taxes or their usurpation of powers and authorities.</p>

<p>Give less money to the government? So it should go to a private entity? Or are you saying we should do something else like end oil subsidies? I could get behind that!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main issue is whether the global warming is anthropogenic (manmade) or not.</p>

<p>The issue some scientists and people have with manmade climate change is that it has been proven that earth goes through cycles of warming and cooling, naturally. Also, CO2 is not the strongest greenhouse gas. In fact, 95% of the major contributions to the greenhouse effect is because of water vapor. Only 0.28% is because of humans additional contribution to the natural order of things, and a little more than half of that human contribution is because of human made carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>Yet, carbon dioxide is the &quot;culprit&quot; targetted by the media and politicians. Opponents to anthropogenic climate change argue that because of this, humans cant possibly be the main reason why our climate is changing.</p>

<p>They go further to point out that the illegit targeting of carbon dioxide by the media and politicians is only good for justification for their &quot;carbon tax&quot; laws they are trying (and i think they already succeeded) to pass, which is a setup itself, allowing a few select individuals to make a shit ton of money through the carbon credit exchanges.</p>

<p>Also, by demonizing carbon dioxide, the federal government has successfully duped the world to justify their nationalization of the energy industry, accounting again for larger profits for a select few.</p>

<p>This political trend, along with the scientific data of the real greenhouse gases contributions tend to make folks question the authenticity of anthropogenic climate change proponents arguments. Especially since they always seem to conveniently &quot;<strong><em>forget about water vapors role</em></strong> in climate change.&quot;</p>

I&#39;ve always known that AGW was a crock of shit, but in the early years of the quasi-religious cult of AGW, there was little resistance to the absurdities. Then, gradually, their lies and deceptions began to be exposed by skeptics, their computer models failed one after another, their prediction did not come true, and people began to realize that it was all a big lie, designed to control people and manipulate them for political power and financial gain. But lately the wheels have come off AGW, as we enter the 18th year with no global warming. I&#39;m eagerly looking forward to watching a stake being pounded through the black heart of this social vampire.</p>
