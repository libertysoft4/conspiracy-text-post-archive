<p>Malaysia Airline Flight MH17 crash in Eastern Ukraine - latest (credible) info</p>

<p>The plane that crashed was flying at 33,000 feet so it would need a sophisticated missile system to shoot it down, if it was shot down. <a href="https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/489793112378990592">https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/489793112378990592</a></p>

<p>There are unconfirmed reports from radar imaging that there was a Kiev military jet flying directly towards the Malaysian airliner in the general area when the airliner crashed, but I don&#39;t how many miles or km away from the passenger plane it was or what weapons it had. It may have been too far away.</p>

<p>Three days ago Kiev said the rebels did not have weapons that could shoot down anything at an altitude of 6.5km or higher. (You&#39;ll have to translate this article.) <a href="http://www.0642.ua/article/575833?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed">http://www.0642.ua/article/575833?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed</a>)</p>

<p>A good attempt at a rational analysis of what might have happened using Game Theory and other explanations. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/2aypva/flight_mh17_schiphol_kuala_lumpur_discussion_topic/cj020zd?context=3">http://www.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/2aypva/flight_mh17_schiphol_kuala_lumpur_discussion_topic/cj020zd?context=3</a></p>

<p>One from Western media with a heavy pro Western government bias (the Guardian) <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/17/malaysia-airlines-plane-crashes-ukraine-live">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/17/malaysia-airlines-plane-crashes-ukraine-live</a></p>

<p>One pro Russian from RT <a href="http://rt.com/news/173628-malaysian-plane-crash-ukraine/">http://rt.com/news/173628-malaysian-plane-crash-ukraine/</a></p>

<p>A comparison of the two versions of the evidence should be made.</p>

<p>N.B. The Western media and statements from the regime in Kiev are already full of lies about this plane crash. E.G this <a href="https://my.news.yahoo.com/ukraine-ministry-rebels-down-military-aircraft-044105335.html">https://my.news.yahoo.com/ukraine-ministry-rebels-down-military-aircraft-044105335.html</a></p>

<p>The rebels in Eastern Ukraine simply do not have any weapons that are capable of shooting down a plane flying at 33,000 feet, so this story is a complete hoax intended to fool the gullible and uninformed.</p>

<p>N.B. This article will be kept updated with credible evidence as it emerges.
Statements by politicians or media that cannot be backed up by hard evidence will not be reported - they are just distractions.
In the unlikely event that someone admits culpability (or their ally does) this will be reported.</p>

<p>US Intelligence Confirms Malaysian Jet Brought Down By Surface-To-Air Missile <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-07-17/us-intelligence-confirms-malaysian-jet-brought-down-surface-air-missile">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-07-17/us-intelligence-confirms-malaysian-jet-brought-down-surface-air-missile</a> </p>

<p>Kiev deployed powerful (BUK) anti-air systems to E. Ukraine ahead of the Malaysian plane crash <a href="http://rt.com/news/173636-buk-malaysian-plane-crash/">http://rt.com/news/173636-buk-malaysian-plane-crash/</a></p>

<p>This story needs to be investigated for veracity.
Translation of @spainbuca&#39;s twitter timeline. Says he works in Ukraine Air Traffic Control, saw the whole thing and that Kiev downed the plane.
<a href="http://slavyangrad.wordpress.com/2014/07/18/spanish-air-controller-kiev-borispol-airport-ukraine-military-shot-down-boeing-mh17/">http://slavyangrad.wordpress.com/2014/07/18/spanish-air-controller-kiev-borispol-airport-ukraine-military-shot-down-boeing-mh17/</a></p>

<p>N.B. The twitter account for @spainbuca was deleted at some point between 7/17 11pm ET and 7/18 11am ET.</p>

<p>The Wall St Journal reports that Manpads (as possessed by East Ukraine rebels) have a maximum height range of about 13,000 feet.
As above, flight MH17 was flying at 33,000 feet.
The civil aviation authorities had set a minimum height to fly over Ukraine of 32,000 feet (to be well out of range of Manpads). To hit a plane flying at 33,000 feet requires a sophisticated anti aircraft system such as the radar guided BUK system <a href="https://twitter.com/UjessU/status/489915499040751616/photo/1">https://twitter.com/UjessU/status/489915499040751616/photo/1</a></p>

<p>N.B. The motive for Kiev to mount a false flag attack on a plane would be to get the US to supply heavy weaponry, planes, missiles etc. and possibly even ground troops to mount an invasion of Eastern Ukraine.
Kiev has suffered a number of recent setbacks in their military campaign in Eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Putin has so far studiously avoided giving the US any excuse to launch an attack on Russia or become overtly involved in the civil war now raging in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Update 2
There are countless accounts in the media that it must have been the rebels from Eastern Ukraine that downed the Malaysian plane (as expected). These accounts do not hold water, or stand up to scrutiny.</p>

<p>There are bogus accounts issued by the Kiev regime that the rebels obtained BUK radar guided anti-tank missiles just in the last few days.
E.G. this article today
<a href="http://censor.net.ua/news/294220/v_snbo_zayavlyayut_chto_u_terroristov_est_voennaya_tehnika_sposobnaya_sbivat_samolety_na_bolshih_vysotah">http://censor.net.ua/news/294220/v_snbo_zayavlyayut_chto_u_terroristov_est_voennaya_tehnika_sposobnaya_sbivat_samolety_na_bolshih_vysotah</a></p>

<p>If such accounts had any credibility whatsoever, they would already have been reported in numerous Western media outlets.</p>

<p>If the rebels actually did possess an operational BUK radar guided anti aircraft missile launcher (which they don&#39;t) and the Kiev regime had reported (with any credibility) that the rebels had BUK anti aircraft missiles capable of shooting down a plane flying at 33,000 feet (or higher), the European aviation authorities would have been notified and no civilian planes would have been flying over Ukraine.
The guidance by Europe&#39;s aviation authorities (before the crash) was that planes could fly over Ukraine at a minimum altitude of 32,000 feet. This would be so they would be well out of range of Manpad shoulder held anti-aircraft missiles which have a maximum height range of about 13,000 feet.
The rebels do have a few Manpad type anti-aircraft missiles, but only a very few, otherwise we would have heard a lot more stories of downed Kiev helicopters and jets. As it is we have heard stories of 2 or 3 downed Kiev helicopters, about 3 transport planes and possibly 1 downed SU-25 fighter.</p>

<p>The whole premise that the rebels possess radar guided BUK anti-aircraft missiles that could have shot down a plane flying at 33,000 feet does not hold water or stand up to scrutiny.</p>

<p>Update 07/19 The mainstream media and Kiev now agree with the above assessment, so they have now changed their story. They are now saying that the rebels must have had considerable assistance from Russia to shoot the plane down, without presenting any credible evidence that Russia was in any way involved.  </p>

<p>Update 3
CNN says it&#39;s very unlikely that the Ukrainian rebels could have shot down the plane
<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/07/17/world/europe/malaysia-airlines-crash-missile/index.html?sr=tw071714bukmissles530pvodtopphoto">http://edition.cnn.com/2014/07/17/world/europe/malaysia-airlines-crash-missile/index.html?sr=tw071714bukmissles530pvodtopphoto</a></p>

<p>Extract from the above article:-</p>

<p>&quot;What seems unlikely is that pro-Russia separatists might have gained control of such a sophisticated piece of weaponry and used it to shoot down an airliner, Ryan said.
&quot;It takes a lot of training and a lot of coordination to fire one of these and hit something,&quot; he said.
Typically, a surface-to-air battery missile consists of a command post vehicle, a radar vehicle, several self-propelled launchers, loader vehicles and even more vehicles to carry new missiles to the batteries as necessary, according to Dan Wasserbly, Americas editor for IHS Jane&#39;s.
Ryan concludes then that if the plane really was shot down, a professional military force -- either on purpose or by accident -- was responsible.
&quot;This is not the kind of weapon a couple of guys are going to pull out of a garage and fire,&quot; he said.&quot;</p>

<p>Was flight MH17 diverted over Donetsk restricted airspace? It didn&#39;t follow it&#39;s normal flightpath.

<p>Ukraine air traffic controller suggests Kiev military shot down passenger plane

<p>It has now been confirmed that Carlos (twitter handle @spainbuca) is a real person who worked for Ukraine Air Traffic Control.
By both the above article and by an interview he did with RT.com on 8th May 2014
<a href="http://actualidad.rt.com/actualidad/view/127516-amenazar-controlador-espanol-ucrania-crisis">http://actualidad.rt.com/actualidad/view/127516-amenazar-controlador-espanol-ucrania-crisis</a></p>

<p>Ukraine&#39;s Security Service Has Confiscated Air Traffic Control Recordings With Malaysian Jet

<p>The Final Moments Of Flight MH-17: The Russian Side Of The Story
<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-07-18/final-moments-flight-mh-17-russian-side-story">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-07-18/final-moments-flight-mh-17-russian-side-story</a></p>

<p>Key points:
It was not safe to fly over the Donetsk / Lugansk region because the air traffic control infrastructure had been destroyed there.
So why was MH17 diverted to fly over that area when the previous flight paths took the plane south of the conflict region?</p>

<p>&quot;And finally, as RT reported, the national governor of the Donetsk region, Pavel Gubarev, admitted that while the separatists indeed are in possession of one BUK missile unit, it is not operational, and even if it was, it would be unable to reach a height of over 30,000 feet without central radar guidance which the Donetsk region does not have, once again suggesting that a Surface to Air Missile, if indeed one was used, came from the Ukraine side. Surely it will be very easy for international monitors to validate this report&quot;</p>

<p>The Tragedy of Flight MH17: Who Benefits?

<p>There is now a collective insanity and hysteria in the mainstream media (even greater than before) parroting the flimsiest of fake evidence that supports &quot;Russia did it&quot; while asking zero rational questions like :-</p>

<p>Who benefits?</p>

<p>Why was MH71 diverted to fly over a war zone? This couldn&#39;t have been done by Russia or the rebels.</p>

<p>Where did the Buk anti-aircraft system supposedly used by the rebels come from?</p>

<p>How was this supposed BUK anti-aircraft launcher linked up to a radar system in Russia? (It couldn&#39;t have been a radar system in Eastern Ukraine, the rebels don&#39;t have a radar system.)</p>

<p>If this had been done why haven&#39;t the CIA reported intercepted radio traffic between a BUK anti-aircraft missile launcher in Ukraine and a radar system in Russia?</p>

<p>Why did the CIA/Pentagon say that they obtained a lock on a radar system being activated in Eastern Ukraine when the rebels don&#39;t have radar (or at least not a radar system in Eastern Ukraine)? The only operational radar systems in Eastern Ukraine are possessed by Kiev forces.</p>

<p>Why is spainboca now incommunicado?</p>

<p>The case for Kiev having downed the plane is very simple:-</p>

<p>They had the necessary equipment and trained personnel to shoot down the plane.</p>

<p>They have the motive which is to provide the excuse to get the US to be more overtly involved in the civil war (which Kiev is currently losing) and to get the the US to provide heavy weaponry - planes, helicopter gunships, missiles etc. or even to provide ground troops for the invasion of Eastern Ukraine.</p>

He told me that it is impossible for a person of normal IQ to mistake a boeing for a military plane with the range in question, given that the crew had same scopes, cradles etc that we use here.
     The link has a Finnish major saying pretty much the same thing, that they should have recocgnized the plane as a civilian aircraft, but prolly thought that no civilian aircraft would fly over the warzone. </p>

<p>Also I&#39;d like to add that just a compulsory military service, even if it&#39;s for 10 years, even if you fought in wars, does not make you capable of operating the BUK-system. You need training for that. </p>

<p>Edit: back to the bordercontrol. Still the russian border is vast. Covered with rough terrain, thick woods and what not. You could sneak some arms yeah. But sneaking in something like a semi-advanced surface to air missile-system would hardly go unnoticed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m was just pointing out that all the other guns and weaponry doesn&#39;t necessarily need to be 100% Russian-supplied. I&#39;ve traveled across eastern Europe on trains with massive bags that were never checked. and also, it is more about getting the weaponry into Ukraine, not Russia.</p>

<p>In this day and age, I don&#39;t think it would be hard to find manuals/instructions on the internet. If there are instructions on how to make elaborate bombs, then why not on how to use weaponry?  Anyone with half a brain could get the knowledge they need. As I said in a different post, there is nothing to say some people weren&#39;t trained to use the Buk in their military service or during past military positions and are using that information now as rebels. Perhaps some of the rebels were highly ranked soldiers in the past. </p>

<p>All signs point to idiots who knew the basic operations but not how to identify what the target actually was, either military or commercial, and that they probably didn&#39;t think commercial passenger jets were flying over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link, that brings up a point I didn&#39;t even consider. These seperatists probably assumed passenger jets wouldn&#39;t fly anywhere near them. Something I also read on Wikipedia that&#39;s somewhat relevant:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking the same thing. The western world forgets that most boys in eastern Europe go through extensive military service, some longer than others. Fairly sure my family did 18 months. Also, some of those rebels look pretty old, my uncles fought in the civil wars there, there&#39;s nothing to say that they weren&#39;t former Ukrainian or Russian soldiers who had further training past their compulsory military service and have taken that with them. Everyone there knows what to do. Maybe if you chucked a random dude from the US onto one of those things, they of course wouldn&#39;t know how to operate it, and thats who is reporting this. We can&#39;t assume that they must have been trained to use it specifically for this particular war and for this occasion. </p>

<p>Also, not that this means anything, but I have had family tell me of their friends carrying away bombs and missiles that never detonated and keeping them as souvenirs lol. Not that this is the equivalent to taking a missile launcher, but in this instance it was easy to get massive weapons and bombs in war torn areas. Had the bomb gone off on them or where they took it or been used in another instance, it would have had foreign fragments and ultimately been blamed on NATO. Furthermore, Europe isn&#39;t like other areas of the world. You can cross borders and possibly not be intercepted, hell, I even flew in to one place and they were super shocked when I tried to leave because they had no record of me entering the country. You can take trains or drive and I never saw any baggage checked. It would be super easy for me to carry over &#39;military&#39; guns from other areas. Weapons don&#39;t necessarily have to come from governments alone. They are rebels, obviously they are doing their own thing.</p>

<p>Launcher? <strong>A fucking launcher?</strong> This isn&#39;t your typical bazooka. It&#39;s a complex out of <strong><em>FIVE MACHINES</em></strong> that work together to lock onto target. Any movement of such complex would immediately be spotted even on Google Maps.

    <div class="md"><p>The rebels did not have a radar system in Eastern Ukraine that could be linked to a BUK anti-aircraft missile launcher. </p>

<p>An operational radar system is required to hit a plane flying at 550mph at 33,000 feet up. </p>

<p>So the rebels BUK launcher would have had to be linked to a Russian radar system in Russia.</p>

<p>I have just updated my blog and the article here with further points, including discussing this exact question.</p>

<p>Emphasis mine:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>n a normal engagement, all three would operate as an integrated weapon system and crew of the CP vehicle are likely to have a good idea of the local air activity.</p>

<p><strong>However, a Buk launcher can also operate in stand-alone mode. Its built-in radar is normally used to track the target being engaged, but can be operated in a target-detection mode, allowing it to autonomously engage targets that were present in the radar&#39;s forward field of view.</strong></p>

<p>Although it has its own identification friend or foe system, this is only able to establish whether the target being tracked is a friendly aircraft. It is the electronic equivalent of a sentry calling out: &quot;Who goes there?&quot;. If there is no reply, all you know is that it is not one of your own combat aircraft. It would not give you a warning that you were tracking an airliner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are trying very hard to debunk the article, but this comment does not actually say anything at all (other than BUK can operate stand alone - it doesn&#39;t say what the maximum height is without radar).</p>

<p>BUK can hit targets up to 49,000 feet WITH radar.</p>

<p>Seeing as how you are so keen to pursue this story, maybe you have an explanation as to why the plane was flying directly over a conflict zone and at least several miles off the course of the previous 10 flights for this route for Malaysian Airlines. See the original blog link and the graphics and links contained therein of the radar tracking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its Ramadan, without a doubt the busiest time of the year for Malaysia Air which has its hub in a Muslim nation.  In the next two weeks, flights in and out of Malaysia will be fully booked and be at least 30% more expensive.  </p>

<p>Accounting may have thought that flying over a conflict zone could save fuel, time and fit as many flights on the route for the week.  </p>

<p>EDIT:   I retract my comment.  It seems as though the flightpath was supposed to be clear of the conflict zone but was diverted to avoid flying into a storm cell.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.co.id/a-fateful-thunderstorm-may-have-doomed-flight-mh17-2014-7/#.U8qv6EDCfU1">http://www.businessinsider.co.id/a-fateful-thunderstorm-may-have-doomed-flight-mh17-2014-7/#.U8qv6EDCfU1</a></p>

<p>so sad.. it looks like the pilot initially thought about going north of the conflict zone but changed his mind.  Maybe the thought his cruising altitude and the radar and personnel on the ground was adequate in discerning that his plane was civilian.</p>

<p>There were multiple civilian aircraft in that area at that time and throughout the day beforehand.  I highly doubt that just this one was routed off course deliberately to be blown up, more likely a terrible twist of fate.</p>

<p>It&#39;s probably ATC incompetence.  It&#39;s also just a tragic coincidence that it was Malaysia Airlines given MH370 in March - it could just as easily have been Etihad, Air India or anyone else in the area at that time.</p>

<p>The truth is easy to tell, there is only one version of it. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t know is easy to say (this is what the Russian government and now the Dutch PM are saying. Both are requesting a proper investigation is performed.

The rebel radar installations had been taken out prior to this event, so they are claiming it is technically impossible for the rebels to have done this even if you assume their one BUK launcher was operational.</p>

<p>Normally you have a dedicated command and control vehicle as well as a dedicated radar vehicle in a BUK battalion.  Jane&#39;s seems to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/18/world/europe/us-officials-say-they-suspect-sa-11-or-sa-20-missiles-brought-down-malaysia-jet.html?_r=1">confirm</a> the Russian version via the NYT.  The rebels apparently lacked this radar vehicle and only had a missile launcher.  The missile vehicle has 4 missiles and it&#39;s own less powerful radar with an upper limit of 30,000 feet.  </p>

<p><a href="http://times.altervista.org/ukrainian-army-shell-military-unit-near-donetsk-destroy-radar-stations/">Here</a> is a report about Ukraine military taking out the radar stations under rebel control.</p>

<p>The air space below 32,000 feet was restricted and the MH17 flight was at 33,000 feet so the rebels didn&#39;t do it apparently.  The question is then whether Russia did it, Ukraine did it, or it&#39;s some sort of higher level false flag.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t see any reason why Russia would.</p>

<p>The nett effect of Obama&#39;s Coup D&#39;Etat in Kiev is to drive Russia and China closer together faster and end American hegemony much earlier than would otherwise be the case. China and Russia have both accelerated their plans to end the USD as Reserve Currency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Option 1 </p>

<p>Kiev would settle for the US supplying the weapons to enable the ethnic cleansing of Eastern Ukraine, whether or not Russia had credible evidence to show that Kiev downed the plane. </p>

<p>This option simply requires the US government to keep spinning lies and for the US (&amp; probably European) media to stay silent on Russia&#39;s evidence. A pretty fair shot. See Iraq 2002/early 2003, Libya 2011, Syria 2011 to now and Ukraine so far.</p>

<p>N.B. Poroshenko has already committed war crimes in Eastern Ukraine by deliberately targeting civilians in civilian houses, so the possibility of the Hague is unlikely to faze him.</p>

<p>Obama has already committed war crimes too, so he won&#39;t have any qualms about committing some more (or supplying the equipment for more war crimes to be committed by somebody else).</p>

<p>Option 3</p>

<p>The Fascists are in Kiev, including pro Bandera Neo Nazi&#39;s. Not in the East. </p>

<p>You could accuse some of the rebels of being communists, because some of them undoubtedly are. The rebels are pro Russian and mostly ethnic Russian having being brought into the Eastern industrial part of Ukraine to Russify it, since Stalin&#39;s time. (I guess Stalin &amp; co thought that they could control non Russian peasants in the West of Ukraine with some starvation etc.) </p>

<p>So far there are no accounts of reckless rebel fighters. Over 200 innocent civilians, including women and children, have been murdered by Kiev with shelling and airstrikes, but there are no documented cases of a rebel killing or even wounding a civilian (they have only killed enemy combatants - Kiev&#39;s troops sent to invade East Ukraine against the local inhabitants wishes). </p>

<p>I guess there is always a first time for some recklessness from the rebels but it seems a low probability option to me. </p>

<p>A SAM (or similar) one or two person shoulder held missile launcher is only effective up to around 13,000 feet. MH17 was flying at 33,000 and could not of been hit by a missile from a shoulder held missile launcher.</p>

<p>I find them releasing that very unlikely unless absolutely necessary. Remember the last Malaysian flight, the one that disappeared. The U.S. refused to release satellite photos they had taken, citing that they didn&#39;t want to show what the resolution their satellites were capable of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Debunking the thunderstorm theory as to why MH17 diverted from it&#39;s normal flight path on 17th July. </p>

<p>The latest explanation for the plane diverting off it&#39;s normal route, offered by pro Kiev supporters, is because of thunderstorms in the path of it&#39;s normal route. </p>

<p>This explanation does not stand up to scrutiny. </p>

<p>MH17 was near Warsaw at 14:44 Ukraine time (EEST,  3 hours ahead of GMT).</p>

<p>It did not start it&#39;s diversion until it entered Ukrainian airspace (see above for maps of flight paths). </p>

<p>There were no thunderstorms in the Kiev area on 17th July. <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/UKKK/2014/7/17/DailyHistory.html">http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/UKKK/2014/7/17/DailyHistory.html</a> </p>

<p>There were thunderstorms in the Odessa area. </p>

<p>These thunderstorms ended by 13:27 EEST. I.E. well before MH17 entered Ukrainian airspace and thus there was no reason for the pilot to divert course because of thunderstorms. </p>

<p>The weather in Odessa on 17th July <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/UKOO/2014/7/17/DailyHistory.html?MR=1">http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/UKOO/2014/7/17/DailyHistory.html?MR=1</a></p>

<p>The reason MH17 diverted from it&#39;s normal path was not because of any thunderstorms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then why do Kiev keep changing their story and keep making stuff up that is easily discredited (like fake video&#39;s and audio tapes)? </p>

<p>The truth is easy to tell. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t know is easy to say.</p>

<p>You often get into an awful mess when you try to lie and Kiev has already demonstrated that it&#39;s not very good at lying because it keeps getting found out on it&#39;s lies (not that the lies are ever reported in the continually lying Corporate owned &amp; controlled M$M - only by alternative media).</p>

The audio recording where the separatists apparently claim responsibility has been very subtlely tweaked; basically, the original recording starts by stating that the plane &quot;was just shot down&quot;, but due to the way Russian verbs work it can be carefully edited to sound just like &quot;we just shot down&quot;.</p>

<p>It was explained yesterday by a native Russian speaker.  That recording is merely a news update between two friends and not an admission.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, you&#39;re using Kiev&#39;s weather, the storm that the flight was avoiding was probably in Zaporihzia.</p>

<p>Secondly, the distance between the two is about 500 km, that&#39;s quite the distance.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the distance between Odessa and Zaporizhzhia is about 200 km, again, quite the distance</p>

<p>Finally, the weather almanac for Zaporizhzhia says the weather was a Thunderstorm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly I am using ODESSA&#39;s weather. </p>

<p>Secondly Kiev was on / near the flight path and I was just pointing out Kiev didn&#39;t have any bad weather. </p>

<p>Thirdly the thunderstorms at Zaporizhzhia finished between 3pm and 3:30pm EEST (Ukraine time zone) EEST is 3 hours ahead of GMT. </p>

<p>This was the time that MH17 crossed into Ukrainian airspace. </p>

<p>Radar contact was lost with MH17 at 4:15pm EEST</p>

<p>According to your map the area with thunderstorms seems to have been moving NE from Odessa to Zaporizhzhia (and then possibly on into Donetsk). </p>

<p>So MH17 diverted north INTO the possible path of thunderstorms, instead of diverting further south towards an area where thunderstorm activity had finished 2 hours earlier. </p>

<p>MH17 could have flown straight over the top of Zaporizhzhia, as the thunderstorms had finished an hour before it got to that area.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we are down to the level of conjecture and supposition I think they probably got told by Kiev Air Traffic Control to fly over a war zone, but I have no proof or even evidence of that.</p>

<p>Kiev Air Traffic Control have confiscated the tapes of the ATC convo&#39;s before any neutral investigators could get hold of them. It&#39;s easy to doctor the tapes (although Kiev have done a very poor job of doing that sort of thing so far - it was easy to tell they were fakes). So we won&#39;t be able to treat this as verifiable / credible evidence.</p>

<p>Looks like Russia has / is going to get the black boxes so whatever the Russians say is on the cockpit tapes won&#39;t be believable either.</p>

<p>I would rather base my conclusions on verifiable hard evidence rather than any conjecture (as per my usual style on my other numerous blog articles). </p>

<p>More evidence is coming out all the time and it&#39;s not looking good for Kiev. (The original title of my blog article had a neutral title, it was started soon after the crash was reported - you can see from the URL. it was something like &quot;Malaysian airlines flight MH17 crash info&quot;. I changed the title a day or so later when it became more and more apparent that Kiev was responsible for the crash.)</p>

<p>It was extremely obvious (at least to me) that Bush/Cheney were spouting absolute garbage about why they wanted to invade Iraq.</p>

<p>The Kiev regime have already told countless lies about what is and has been going on in Ukraine already. They are not a credible source of info. </p>

<p>What did local people actually see? Ordinary people can be bribed to say things you want them to say. Kiev has bribed ordinary people already to give accounts and views that directly opposed more credible accounts. </p>

<p>The US and Obama have repeatedly lied almost continually, about Libya, about Syria, about Ukraine, among many other things. (Obama&#39;s no different to Bush/Cheney.)</p>

<p>Re: the radio recordings. These can very easily be faked (e.g. using/doctoring a recording of a convo by rebels discussing the downing of one of the transport planes earlier). A similar ruse was used as part of the justification for going to war in Syria after the CW in Damascus 2013. The CW attack was carried out by Islamic Extremists firing on rebel held positions. The Syria False Flag CW attack was probably engineered by the Turkish government (or via them).</p>

<p>The CIA and the Pentagon lie to the public all the time. </p>

<p>The CIA&#39;s BUSiNESS is lies and deceit (at least to anyone not in the White House and sometimes they lie to the WH occupant too). </p>

<p>No photo&#39;s of BUK&#39;s need to be faked - these could have been taken anywhere and it&#39;s a known fact that Kiev are using and deploying them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you on Iraq and the American public was incredibly stupid to believe that crap since it made no sense and conflicted with facts that the UN inspectors had found.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there were any signficant lies about the war in Libya.  I don&#39;t think there were significant lies in Syria especially since Obama has been avoiding US involvement there.  It is lucky that we don&#39;t have warmonger McCain as president since we would already be fighting at least two more wars.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think reports are lying about where and when they took Buk photos and I doubt that the CIA has planted as many reporters in as many countries press as this would require.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why the Libyan Civil War of 2011 Happened</p>

<p>Civil unrest in the East of Libya and thence civil war was instigated/encouraged by the CIA as a result of Gaddafi&#39;s announcement in 2006 that he was going to start selling oil in something other than US Dollars.</p>

<p>Libya was already on the target list of 6 countries scheduled for regime change by force, in the PNAC documents first published in 1997.
The other countries were Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iran.</p>

<p>Gaddafi was gaining some traction within the Gulf States and Black Africa for using the Gold Dinar in international trade, instead of the US Dollar.</p>

<p>Libya also had an independent Central Bank that was not under the control of the Federal Reserve / BIS system.</p>

<p>All of these things made Gaddafi a target to protect the petrodollar system and the power of large American banks.</p>

<p>N.B. in the middle of the Libyan civil war in 2011, when Gaddafi was still driving around Tripoli trying to stoke up support, the Islamic Extremists who were leading the revolt from Benghazi announced that they WOULD by setting up a new Libyan Central Bank, that WOULD come under the control of the Federal Reserve/BIS system. Normally people fighting a civil war are more concerned about winning the civil war, than announcing forthcoming changes to the set up of that country&#39;s Central Bank when and if the current ruler/leader is toppled.</p>

<p>If the &quot;rebels&quot; did ever manage to displace Assad, Syria would end up like Libya is now. A hot bed of violence between rival Islamic Extremist terrorist groups and a failed State.</p>

<p>The various Islamic Extremist terrorist groups are already murdering each other in Syria as they fight for scraps on what is increasingly the losing side.

<p>So Saudi Arabia wants to give the jihadists some fresh hope by supplying them with new heavy weaponry.
What will these people do with the anti aircraft missiles (MANPADS) that Obama is thinking of giving them?

Apparently some of them have already got US manufactured wire guided (TOW) anti tank missiles.

<p>The chemical weapon attack in Damascus August 2013, which provided the previous excuse for escalating America&#39;s involvement in the Syrian civil war, was undoubtedly a false flag attack by the Syrian &quot;rebels&quot; and was not carried out by Assad. This has been confirmed by the report from the UN Weapons Inspection team and the US government&#39;s own intel.</p>

<p>Needless to say Saudi Arabian, Qatari and Neocon interests in the Syrian war have nothing whatsoever to do with any humanitarian concerns.
They are about building a gas pipeline from Qatar, through Saudi Arabia, Syria and Turkey to Europe.
And they are about stopping a gas pipeline being built from Iran to Syria.
Syria is also on the Neocon path to Tehran.
Syria is merely the continuation of PNAC, the Neocon agenda published in 1997, which called for regime change by force in Iraq, Libya, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iran.</p>

<p>The Iran Iraq Syria gas pipeline and the Syrian conflict
This pipeline will run from Iran&#39;s South Pars gas field which is the largest in the world and exit on the coast of Syria or Lebanon. The deal for this was signed on 25th July 2013 between Iran, Iraq and Syria.</p>

<p>This deal is absolutely against the interests of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and Israel.
It is absolutely in the interests of Europe, Japan, ordinary Americans and the world in general, but not in the interests of those who control the American government.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia and Qatar are hoping to build their own gas pipeline through Syria and Turkey to Europe. Turkey because of the above plus the existing Ceyhan pipeline from the Caucasus (the Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan pipeline built by BP). Israel because of the large gas field found off shore in 2010, which they are naturally hoping to market to Europe.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia and Qatar appear to be falling out with each other, as they support rival Islamic Extremist terrorist groups in Egypt and Libya and the prospects for building their proposed joint gas pipeline through Syria fall apart.
Saudi Arabia has recently demanded that Qatar shut down Al-Jazeera in the Gulf.
Several Al-Jazeera journalists are currently being held in detention in Egypt. Just another political pressure point to add to the mix.</p>

<p>This deal between Iran, Iraq and Syria explains much of the Syrian conflict and the signing of the Iranian gas pipeline deal, explains much of the war escalation and urgency in August and September 2013. The American military machine was attempted to be co-opted to ensure that the deal does not go ahead. Either with Assad being toppled and replaced with an Islamic Extremist government that Saudi Arabia thinks it can control or Syria is divided into a number of small less powerful states with on-going sectarian and religious wars.

<p>Boehner has just stated that he is going to open a Congressional enquiry, which is to be chaired by Trey Gowdy.</p>

<p>The attack on the Consulate in Benghazi was the result of CIA gun running from Benghazi to Syria and one of the Islamic Extremist groups falling out with the CIA.</p>

<p>The murders in Benghazi and the gun running that caused it, should be as big a scandal as Iran/Contra - if not bigger. But I doubt very much if the GOP in Congress intend to go anywhere near the gun running, or the CIA collaboration with Islamic terrorist groups, or the involvement of the Turks and the Saudi&#39;s. So why don&#39;t we try and kick up a stink about it, by telling the GOP base?</p>

<p>Benghazi gun running is the real scandal - the red line and the rat line

<p>ISIS Unveiled: The Identity of The Insurgency in Syria and Iraq

<p>The results of the US backed funding of Islamic Extremist terrorist groups and the US invasion of Iraq</p>

<p>Iraq has been a bloodbath for a decade, it&#39;s economy and infrastructure have been ruined. Over 500,000 Iraqi&#39;s have died during the US occupation, millions have been displaced. Numerous major birth defects and other illnesses are being reported due to the US using depleted uranium in Fallujah. The US also used white phosphorus, which is banned as a chemical weapon under the Geneva convention.
N.B. Iraq was never &quot;pacified&quot; by a troop surge as the Neocons claim. The Sunni&#39;s were bribed with billions of US tax dollars to keep quiet for a while - but this bribe money has now dried up.</p>

<p>The CIA engineered civil war in Libya, in support of Islamic Extremists from Benghazi, has turned Libya into a bloodbath with various armed militias shooting each other. It&#39;s economy and infrastructure also lie in ruins. Libya&#39;s oil production has nearly been wiped out.</p>

<p>The CIA engineered Syrian civil war has turned Syria into a bloodbath with 140,000 (on both sides) killed. Syria&#39;s economy and infrastructure also lie in ruins. Millions have been displaced and have fled as refugees.
The Islamic Extremists (which comprise almost all of the actively fighting &quot;rebels&quot;) have been losing the war against Assad in Syria so they have now turned their attention back to Iraq with some major gains by ISIS including taking over $400m from Iraqi banks (we await further developments).</p>

<p>The US war against Pakistan has killed hundreds of innocent civilians with drone strikes including 170 children.</p>

<p>The civil war in Yemen where the US has used cruise missiles, cluster bombs and drone strikes in support of a corrupt dictator has turned Yemen into a bloodbath.</p>

<p>Boku Haram which is covertly funded and armed by the US proxy Saudi Arabia, via islamic extremists in Libya is murdering christians in Nigeria.</p>

<p>Mali&#39;s legitimate government was overthrown in a joint US &amp; French military coup in 2012 to be replaced by a puppet President trained by the US at military bases in the US.</p>

<p>The Afghan poppy crop which had been reduced by 90% with the Taleban&#39;s ban in 2000 is now greater than ever. More Afghans are now subject to drugs warlords (of which Karzai &amp; his brother are both major ones). Afghanistan remains a bloodbath and a hot civil war.</p>

<p>A semi stable government in Somalia was overthrown by Ethiopia in a US backed coup. Somalia is in chaos, with elements of this chaos murdering innocent civilians in Kenya.</p>

<p>More than 200 million more people now support Islamic Extremism than they did in 2005.</p>

<p>Ukraine has been turned into a civil war zone by a US engineered illegal Coup D&#39;Etat in Kiev. Ukraine is joining Iraq, Syria and Libya in the utter misery, violence, death and poverty that comes with US &quot;liberation&quot;.</p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t be quite so bad, if the nett result of all this US mega stupidity wasn&#39;t the ruining of the US economy and the very dramatic quickening of the end of the petrodollar system and the end of American hegemony to hand over the reins of power to a SE Asia dominated world, centered on China - with Russia, the Brics, Africa and South America as allies.</p>

<p>If anything, only the plane type is same. Nothing more.</p>

<p>People are saying that the two aircraft had very close serial numbers, and that this is proof of a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a hint: airlines normally order brand new aircraft of the same type in batches, and aircraft are built to order from scratch.  Malaysia Airlines clearly ordered a batch of 777s which rolled off the production line at pretty much the same time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The editor of Jane&#39;s Weekly agrees with me that the rebels do not have the capability of shooting down a plane flying at 33,000 feet.</p>

<p>I have got a bunch of stories coming out of Kiev and the Western media, trying to blame Russia, or the rebels, or the Russians helping the rebels for the crash. These are being discredited one by one. </p>

<p>The truth is easy to tell, there is only one version of it. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t know is easy to say (this is what the Russian government and now the Dutch PM are saying. Both are requesting a proper investigation is performed. I&#39;m not quite sure how a full and thorough investigation is going to be possible now, as so much evidence has now been tainted by Kiev and the rebels, but any neutral investigation is better than none). </p>

<p>When you start lying you often get into an awful mess and this is what Kiev and the US and European media have been doing.</p>

<p>We await further info, more info is coming out all the time.</p>

<p>My narrative is far stronger than the one being pushed by the Corporate owned and controlled mainstream media. It&#39;s also more truthful because I always try my best to avoid any lies going around and use best available evidence - unlike the M$M which lies constantly and continuously in order to push a propaganda agenda to deceive the unthinking and ignorant masses.</p>
