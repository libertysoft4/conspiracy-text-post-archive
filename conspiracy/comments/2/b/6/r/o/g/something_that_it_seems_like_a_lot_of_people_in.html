If you can disprove it then don&#39;t accept it as a good theory.  A lot of people seem to call me a shill or downvote people if they offer an explanation for a theory that goes against the &quot;conspiracy theory.&quot;  You need to try to disprove every theory or else you end up with a bunch of shit theories that are easily debunked and damage the reputation of any possible legitimate theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Ponds and Fleishman experiment reproduction attempts led by the same Dr. Steven E. Jones that&#39;s now a 9/11 whistler blower oddly(?) enough, didn&#39;t use enough heavy water.  In other words, the &#39;evidence&#39; debunking the initial experiment was cooked.  Plus NASA just did a symposium earlier this year looking into the possibility of LENR for future space craft.  There are over 30 companies right now that have already filed patents and working on the last stages of commercializing the reactors, they can&#39;t all be conmen and their inventions can&#39;t all be suppressed from the public, especially if the designs are open sourced and spread over encrypted internet protocols.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with what you&#39;re saying. 
To use an example, if I wake up and my car is totalled on the driveway, everyone can have a different theory. Jane could say she say Bob use the car at 10pm last night, he must have done it. John can say he&#39;s been having trouble with the neighbours, he thinks they did it. I can say little green men must have trashed it. I can say, feel, and think whatever I want, but if I&#39;m gonna try to sell this theory to someone, I better have seen something, have others who saw lights in the sky, have caught a video of the green men themselves. 
If you&#39;re gonna present a theory, you need to be able to support it in some way. It doesn&#39;t mean you will always be right, even if you have valid evidence. But it should be more than &quot;it must be&quot; with no reason why, and you should be prepared to hear opinions from both sides. </p>

<p>The thing with this sub, in my opinion, is the freedom to express you&#39;re opinion without being ridiculed. I have no right to pop in and post &quot;You&#39;re a fucking retard if you think that!&quot; And off I go. But I do have a right to start a discussion if I don&#39;t agree with your theory. I can present my evidence disproving your theory, and you can counter. </p>

<p>But screaming &quot;Shill!&quot; is just as bad as someone calling bullshit because they decide something is just stupid. </p>

<p>If someone doesn&#39;t want to hear opposite opinions, they&#39;re not gonna have a very good time on the internet</p>

<p>what 600 people, the SHES school was not a school in 2012. the cops own forensic evidence photos which show mold in the school prove that, that and the broken stair railings and other illegal problems for a school building.</p>

<p>they claim 480 students for the K4 grades, and that is a claim.</p>

<p>anybody who believe that SHES was a real tragic event, then they either are paid to, or they are lost to the world of sanity and reason.</p>

<p>the peoples/town of Newtown got $100 million from various sources, quite a lucrative day for that failing govt spook town.</p>

<p>and you have got to remember, most CT people only get interested when the MSM and the professional (but incompetent) propagandists promote an illogical story as gospel, otherwise nobody would bother with the story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Give me one example.  When I say that Sandy Hook wasn&#39;t a staged event I don&#39;t say it because that would be a harsh truth.  I say it because it doesn&#39;t make a single bit of sense and there is no evidence supporting that idea.  On the contrary, there is a lot that says that it wasn&#39;t staged.  Just because you can dream up a conspiracy doesn&#39;t mean it is worth believing.

    <div class="md"><p>The person making the claim has the burden of proof.  For example, I don&#39;t for a second believe that Sandy Hook was a staged event.  I&#39;ve read pretty much everything there is to read and I&#39;ve seen a dozen &quot;100% proof Sandy Hook was hoax&quot; videos.  (I also have the benefit of knowing someone who was/is friends with one of the mothers who lost a kid there).  However, here is why I never believed that theory even before I realize my aunt was friends with one of the mother&#39;s.  It doesn&#39;t make sense.  Nobody can explain to me how in a school that had 600 kids enrolled not a single parent or student came forward and said &quot;hey those people on TV saying they lost a child in the shooting.. we don&#39;t know who they are!  They must be actors!&quot;  Nobody (not a single person) has come forward and said that.  This S.H. was a staged event theory presupposes that there are only 2 options: either it&#39;s the official version OR if there is any inconsistencies between the official version and the evidence it was 100% staged.  That in and of itself is a false assumption.  </p>

Evidence that contradicts the official Sandy Hook story isn&#39;t evidence of a Hoax.  It is just as easily evidence of terrible journalism or multiple shooters or a space alien invasion.</p>

<p>the kids being evacuated did rather look like special ed students, kids that are not particular valued by society. some heartless DHS types might considered them disposable assets to be sacrificed for propaganda and maybe even ritual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My aunt lives in Maryland but she went to college with this lady and has remained friends with her.  In your example of the government coming to people to pay them off or scare them they would have to do this to 500+ families (if you are talking about kids enrolled in the school and their families) and the surrounding area.  Anybody who lived near the school would have to be paid off also.  What are the odds that every single person would agree to be paid off and get their identity changed?  Also, These people surely have friends and family who would wonder &quot;hey where do my sister from Newtown and her daughter go?&quot;  People can&#39;t just disappear.  That&#39;s easy enough to do with a single person who doesn&#39;t have any family.  Trying to pull that off with hundreds of people at the same time and nobody asking any questions or giving any resistance?  That is pretty much impossible.</p>

That sounds more reasonable than the idea that grieving parents are sometimes given xanax to help them get thru a rough patch?  This idea that &quot;these people don&#39;t seem as sad as I think they should&quot; is not evidence of a staged event.  Also the idea that the entire town was a government bought sound stage just in case one day they want to fake shoot up a school is also pretty far-fetched.  How does any of that sound more plausible than the official story?  People seem to be so committed to the idea that this was a staged event that they are willing to bend any piece of information they get with the intention of proving their already determined conclusion.
