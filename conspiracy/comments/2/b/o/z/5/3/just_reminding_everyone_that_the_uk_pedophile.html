    <div class="md"><p>Yes but these are not coincidences.</p>

<p>Journalists should take responsibility for their role in society, not to sell papers based on headlining news, but to keep the prevalent issues conciously in the minds of the masses until those issues are resolved.</p>

<p>Instead, it is used to conciously keep the minds of the masses occupied and arguabley over focused. we have an analysis paralysis when we look at the problems of the world and it is up to us to remain focused, as individuals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It will never get resolved if that is the outlook you take on it. You have already accepted defeat and therefore your defeat in inevitable. I have not reached a point where I see no solution to this problem.</p>

<p>What that solution is and the best one for everyone is up for debate, but there is no excuse for this to be a part of society, particularly to this extent, anymore.</p>

<p>It is obsolete and primitive behavior. Once people realize that our global &#39;society&#39; is nothing more than the consolidation of tribal principles, and predominated by a particular tribe with abhorent ideology, then we can start to build true society, based on enlightenment.</p>

<p>we must enable the illumination of truth to perpetuate change, even if we are the only one, even if there are immense obstacles, we MUST not stop.</p>

<p>why? because it is inside all of us to be the change we want to see in the world. What power does a judge or a politician have over you other than the power that you yourself have given them?</p>

<p>Judges and politicians and these tribes stand together united. Individuals stand against them and thus have very slow progress. There must be unity of the enlightened mind. A collective conciousness can, and will, bring light back into the direction of humanity.</p>

<p>I&#39;m choosing my battles wisely. This particular battle has been going on for ages and will never stop and will always be lurking in the corner. Its better to accept its happening so that people are aware of it and can protect themselves and people they love from getting sucked in to its destructive powers.</p>

<p>These and many other secret underground worlds are little known to the public. Just like the Skull &amp; Bones and the people running this country. There is also the The Saturnalian Brotherhood that is connected to all this. </p>

<p>There is so much to uncover and wrap your mind around. Once you do know what is the next step? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are just as many secretive organizations that oppose these organizations. I suggest you shift your focus from the negative groups to the positive groups and get into the game.</p>

<p>Choosing your battles wisely is definitely a wise move, but choosing to unify and fight as a group is wiser.</p>

<p>I agree that for the masses it might be better to accept certain realities so that they may protect themselves. But with understanding of these realities comes the inevitable choice about what you as an individual will do about it.</p>

<p>Apathy is the glove in which evil slips its hand and I think at this day and age, every individual has the potential to empower themselves. I think protecting yourself and your loved ones from being sucked into the destructive power is a short term band aid that will not manifest any long term change.</p>

<p>For every person that is unaware or unable to prevent themselves beeing sucked into the destruction, that destructive power grows exponentially.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>As for this statement, true, there are many many rabbit holes to go down but ALL, and I mean ALL holes lead to one single destination. The choice of action or inaction.</p>

<p>That next step is entirely up to you. Do what thou wilt. But the ultimate conclusion is exceedingly simple. There are ways to live your life that either indirectly or directly cause harm to other people, and there are ways to live your life that directly or indirectly benefit other people.</p>

<p>To choose to live in a way that benefits only you and those you care about is to be part an anchor holding back the progression of those who would do good and to provide ammunition and resources to those who would do harm.</p>

<p>Ultimately, there is only one battle and it is internal. Depending on which part of you wins that battle, we will see if you can see that every battle is the same and requires your attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I completely understand where you are coming from. You sound lost in the sense that you see the world for what it is but lack an outlet to adequately express the actions that would bring peace to the world, and thus to yourself.</p>

<p>I think if you can find peace in yourself, then you will find a way to bring peace to the world. With inner peace come unparalleled resolve and with that resolve you can join the ranks of doing SOMETHING, and that something really can be anything.</p>

<p>Its about creating critical mass, one drop of water into the cup at a time and on a long enough timeline the cup will overflow. I think the timeline for these events, and most of the detrimental groups extends back to the phonecians and the creation of language itself.</p>

<p>Though the cup has been filled a drop at a time, we have been on a long enough time line that the cup is begining to over flow. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a unifying flag to stand under or a grassroots infrastructure for you to join up with. Each person has their own path and the way you can help, hurt, or do nothing is entirely based on your own understanding of yourself and your capability.</p>

<p>Standing up and stopping it is not simple, but standing up is simple. It just requires internal resolve.</p>

<p>One thing that I can do, is post a thread similar to this every week. Just copy and pasting a reminder in something that takes one minute of my time and can help keep the problem and the story in the minds of whoever I can get to read.</p>

<p>This is helpful and to help is enough. Eventually like minds band together, the same way these evil groups have come together under their shared values, so must everyone else come together in shared values.</p>

<p>My values are courage, interconnectedness, and peace and I welcome anyone who wants to do anything whatsoever, big or small, effective or ineffective, that supports my values.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where do we &quot;step up&quot; to though? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no one that will tell you that but yourself. But look around, find someone doing something you support that you think is related to bigger problems, or if you dont see something, think of something and post it here.</p>

<p>Something is always better than nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You kind of just made my point for me.  When I said that the vast majority of people have no idea that a global pedo ring exists, what I was getting at is that informing these people, discussing these things without fear of repercussions, and reaching critical mass are the most important things.  &quot;We the people&quot; aren&#39;t currently in a position to step up and resolve this issue because the majority of &quot;we the people&quot; have no idea the problem even exists.</p>

<p>I agree with the rest of your post and I share those values - I feel like you took what I said before as being defeatist or pessimistic or something but that couldn&#39;t be further from the truth.</p>

<p>Keep fighting the good fight my friend, I&#39;ll be there beside you when push comes to shove.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah I see your point better now and I apologize I assumed a defeatist attitude in you. This is reddit afterall and tone and body language are quite hard to discern.</p>

<p>But i disagree, we the people are absolutely in the position to do something, and it doesnt even require them understanding the full extent of the evil corruption of such groups.</p>

<p>I look at things like the zeitgeist movement or the venus project and I see ideas for building a society that does not require all of the things that our current society embodies that gives power to the elites.</p>

<p>If we develop systems and communities that are self sufficient and self reliant then we can free people from their day to day stresses associated with whatever bullshit they have to deal with for the day.</p>

<p>First we must build a world that free minds support, and then we market that world as not only cheaper and more sustainable, but as a solution for the chain that is debt itself and the root of control over society.</p>

<p>We break the debt system, we break the system that causes people to feel obligated to live one way, and we provide alternative ways of living that enables free though and rationale observation.</p>

<p>This will start out small and slow but I&#39;d say the counterculture of the 60&#39;s made good headway. Now the millenials are picking up where they left off and the elites have gone too far in stressing the minds of their prisoners.</p>

<p>I do not think anyone needs to fight anyone to be perfectly honest. We just need to boycott any and all institutions that utilize violence. The elites rely on these institutions, and more importantly the acceptance thereof, to maintain and grow their power. They will of course try to not allow for such a boycott and will label such people with some kind of word designed to push people away.</p>

<p>But if we can just maintain the zen mindset and regardless of what other may do, control ourselves to never, ever react in violence. Then they have no power. They will be forced to assert their power overtly, fascisting, dictaroially, and brutally. Fear is all they know, they will turn to it in their time of need and utilize it to its most devastating effect.</p>

<p>In doing so they will reveal themselves and cause the very mass scale awakening they seek to oppress. All we have to do is build, design, anticipate, and plan for these outcomes in every region of the world, and welcome the refugees of the old world, into the new world.</p>

<p>There is no creature that can control the darkness. The darkness just is. By trying to control the darkness to their benefit the elites have already lost. It just doesnt feel like it because our individual lives are so short and we lack a fourth dimensional perception of time.</p>

<p>So my friend build, fight if you are forced to defend yourself, and then keep building. Build it and they will come.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then you need to look at something other than Google news. In the last week I&#39;ve seen stories about Lord Tonypandy and Cyril Smith being investigated for abuse in  the 70s or 80s, there&#39;s been the story about DLT being retried, there&#39;s been a story about kids in Grantham in the 60s being told not to go into Thatcher&#39;s dad&#39;s shop because he had &quot;wandering hands&quot; - I haven&#39;t searched or made an effort to find them, those are just the stories I remember seeing on one national newspaper&#39;s website. </p>

<p>Pay attention, people like you are why we are in this fucking mess, it&#39;s in the papers and you don&#39;t even see it. Why the fuck would the mainstream media cover a story if idiots like you aren&#39;t even going to see it?</p>

<p>I think we are disconnecting on the definition of MSN so please allow me to rephrase my point (which I felt was glaringly obvious) to &quot;in my opinion there is not enough coverage of this story in all the media and I think we should all do something to ensure the conversation stay prominent in the public domain&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>I would certainly agree that that would be a better way of making your point. Saying it has all but disappeared from the mainstream media simply isn&#39;t accurate. I would also suggest that however customisable Google News is, it clearly isn&#39;t finding the stories you are interested in.</p>

<p>I suspect that part of our disagreement may lie in the different ways we spell &quot;customise&quot; - if you are saying the story has disappeared from the US media you may be right, it certainly hasn&#39;t disappeared from the UK media.</p>

<p>Yeah.  And coming on here saying &quot;you&#39;ve missed the point&quot; doesn&#39;t seem like a very good way to get positively noticed.  Additionally, if what you just stated here was the point, then you&#39;re actually incorrect in saying I &quot;missed the point&quot; because there is nothing about what I initially said that precludes this point.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t hold your breath.  There&#39;s, again, a <em>reason</em> why this kind of crime gets continuously shoved down the memory hole.  It&#39;s because there are beings at the <em>very</em> top of the pecking order on this planet that put stories like this <em>in</em> there.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t to say that efforts to remind everyone shouldn&#39;t continue.  Of course not.  However, realize that there won&#39;t be any real coverage of the pedophile issues or many of the other horrible issues plaguing this planet on the MSM.</p>

<p>It has to be independently done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It will never get resolved if that is the outlook you take on it. You have already accepted defeat and therefore your defeat in inevitable. I have not reached a point where I see no solution to this problem.</p>

<p>What that solution is and the best one for everyone is up for debate, but there is no excuse for this to be a part of society, particularly to this extent, anymore.</p>

<p>It is obsolete and primitive behavior. Once people realize that our global &#39;society&#39; is nothing more than the consolidation of tribal principles, and predominated by a particular tribe with abhorent ideology, then we can start to build true society, based on enlightenment.</p>

<p>we must enable the illumination of truth to perpetuate change, even if we are the only one, even if there are immense obstacles, we MUST not stop.</p>

<p>why? because it is inside all of us to be the change we want to see in the world. What power does a judge or a politician have over you other than the power that you yourself have given them?</p>

<p>Judges and politicians and these tribes stand together united. Individuals stand against them and thus have very slow progress. There must be unity of the enlightened mind. A collective conciousness can, and will, bring light back into the direction of humanity.</p>
