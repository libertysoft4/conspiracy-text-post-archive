    <div class="md"><p>wow that greenbaum speech transcript was just one of the most disturbing things i&#39;ve ever read. before now i really had no idea how massive the scope of this shit was. i was very skeptical of the whole thing until something particular he said when he was taking questions. the way he answered a specific question really suggested to me that he was trying to describe something that actually happened, which was actually stored in his memory. it was right then that i was convinced he wasn&#39;t lying. some may be skeptical just because of how crazy the subject is. but the way he kind of spontaneously recalled and connected events suggested to me very strongly that he wasn&#39;t spinning a web. there was no storytelling component to his answer. even the way he kind of ignores speaking on the sensational aspects of the subject, only speaking about the professional aspects and specifics for treatment, you can tell he&#39;s not bullshitting anyone. i&#39;m really surprised to learn that there are PhD&#39;s out there who believe in this stuff. a lot of skeptics would probably try to claim that scientists think this stuff is a joke.. but here&#39;s one who&#39;s seen it himself, and holds lectures to encourage other therapists to see for themselves whether their patients are victims. i&#39;m really curious to see if there are any therapists other than him who have publicly stated that their patients exhibit these signs.</p>

<p>thanks for the wealth of information</p>

<p>To whomever is reporting, downvoting, or otherwise trying to conceal this post: WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?? You&#39;re protecting pedophiles, many of them sadistic murderers, so they can rape, torture, and often murder <em>children</em>. You are literally Aiding and Abetting Rape, Torture, and Murder. Of little kids.</p>

<p>Is it that worth a paycheck to you?? Get a little self respect and stop licking your master&#39;s boots. And if you still think you&#39;re a decent person, prove it -- go public with what you know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could be they are doing their jobs, but a journalist that puts his name on the line and exposes the depth of the scandal could really be putting his own life in jeopardy.  That&#39;s why you really have to have a lot of respect for people like Glenn Greenwald. </p>

<p>Also, if you remember, In the Rupert Murdoch hacking scandal, someone put out a hit job on one of the witnesses.  The witness was dead and gone before he could ever testify.  It goes to show there really is no courage without fear. </p>
