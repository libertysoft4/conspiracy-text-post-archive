<p>Seems to be pure Fearmongering 101...INFLATE the threat and fund some more Defense/Intelligence NOW!!!</p>

<p>The 2014 National Security Budgets of the U.S. and Russia are estimated at:</p>

<p><strong>FACT:</strong>  U.S. has gone over $1 TRILLION for 2014 (if the last $65 Billion goes through that Obama requested for Defense in early July goes through).</p>

<p><strong>FACT:</strong>  Russia’s 2014 National Security Budget is not even at $75 Billion</p>

<p>SO, the U.S. spends OVER 10X what Russia is spending on National Security in 2014. In fact, the additional $65 Billion Obama recently requested is almost the <em>entire</em> amount that Russia will spend for National Security in all of 2014. </p>

<p>CORRECTION: The Headline is actually</p>

<p><strong>COLD WAR II</strong></p>

<p><strong>The West is losing Putin’s dangerous game</strong></p>

<p>(I accidentally omitted the “II” after &quot;COLD WAR”)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The big picture and what most are missing is that the U.S. is an all but declared enemy of an independent and independently powerful Russian state, while many European countries, most important of which Germany, are not. The latter seek to coexist economically cooperatively with Russia while convinced of the reality of its respect for Nato and of its reciprocal acceptance of the current EU-configured order in Europe. It is only the Americans who do not seem to be accepting of this mutually sustaining reality as demonstrated in their representative to Ukraine&#39;s vivid declaration: &quot;Fuck the EU.&quot; Regime change has been the declared aim of the U.S. with regard to many countries, now the radicalism of such an approach is even more clearly revealed as it works to destroy the strategic and trade equilibriums of its allies (e.g. France and Germany) in its fundamental goal of preventing the emergence of a Russian counter-power to its hegemonic ambitions in Eurasia. The problem with such uncompromising intolerance to Russian strategic interests even within the latter&#39;s territorial vicinity (which is naturally that of an extensive power) is a very serious one indeed: global nuclear war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One important aspect of the the trade equilibrium was analyzed by whowhatwhy recently...I don’t think the U.S. and Russia would ever actually be crazy enough to go nuclear--but then again, supposedly there were U.S. Generals arguing for a first strike by the U.S. under JFK. As U.S. citizens we have very little knowledge of what goes on inside the Pentagon--supposedly the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has 10X the budget of the CIA and 100X the manpower. Even scarier is that, unlike the CIA, the DIA has NO Oversight by Congress. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you want to understand where the rubber meets the geopolitical road in the Ukraine war, you need to learn about the 1,480-mile South Stream natural gas pipeline.</p>

<p>The pipeline is core to the larger battle being fought over Europe between Moscow and Washington. It may even have been a motivation behind Russia’s annexation of Crimea. And if there’s a crack in the unified front between the U.S. and Europe over Russia’s role in Ukraine, South Stream is it.</p>

<p>Why does South Stream matter? It’s a $21.6 billion project to connect Russia’s gas reserves—the world’s largest—to Europe’s markets.  Europe relies on Russia for about 30 percent of its natural gas.</p>

<p>Any delays in finishing the pipeline—scheduled for completion in 2018—can only help Russia’s competitors in the international energy business.  And one player gearing up to challenge Russia in the European energy market is the United States.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re right about Putin winning.  They&#39;ve been trying to draw Russia into a war for most of this year and failing.  Cold War is they best they can do for now.</p>

<p>I wonder what is driving the US to desperately try to provoke war wherever and however it can.  There have been so many crises that have failed to be crises this year.</p>
