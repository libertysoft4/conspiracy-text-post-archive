<p>There are dozens of eyewitnesses who claim to have heard multiple explosions in the basements of WTC 1 and 2, also.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were explosions in the basements of the WTC. The question is what caused them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are eyewitnesses who claim they saw men &#39;working on&#39; the elevator shafts in the towers shortly before 9/11.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So? I&#39;ve seen people working on elevators.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are eyewitnesses who claim all bomb sniffing security dogs were removed from the towers in the weeks leading up to 9/11.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apparently, <em>some</em> bomb-sniffing dogs were removed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So if you choose to believe the Pentagon eyewitnesses then you must also choose to believe the WTC eyewitnesses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seriously? No, it is not a choice of believing every eyewitness everywhere at all times and never believing any eyewitness anywhere.</p>

<p>Eyewitness testimony must always and everywhere be evaluated for believability and accuracy. For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyewitness_testimony#Jury_guidelines">here&#39;s a checklist that someone has suggested that juries consider:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>How well could the eyewitness observe the thing he reports? Were his senses equal to the observation? Was his physical location suitable to sight, hearing, touch? Did he have the proper social ability to observe: did he understand the language, have other expertise required (e.g., law, military)?</p></li>
<li><p>When did he report in relation to his observation? Soon? Much later?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there additional clues to intended veracity? Was he indifferent on the subject reported, thus probably not intending distortion? Did he make statements damaging to himself, thus probably not seeking to distort? Did he give incidental or casual information, almost certainly not intended to mislead?</p></li>
<li><p>Do his statements seem inherently improbable: e.g., contrary to human nature, or in conflict with what we know?</p></li>
<li><p>Remember that some types of information are easier to observe and report on than others.</p></li>
<li><p>Are there inner contradictions in the testimony?</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>With regard to the plane hitting the Pentagon, we have a large number of independent witnesses who saw a large, familiar object (an airplane) fly near them in broad daylight and hit the Pentagon. They were interviewed a short time after the event (often the same day).</p>

<p>What possible reason can there be for ignoring their statements?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As much as I&#39;d love to see some IMAX-quality footage of the towers falling, if I only had one hour I think I&#39;d take a different approach.</p>

<p>One hour prior to the first hit, I&#39;d show up at the north tower and cause a ruckus. Make picket signs, get people off the street involved. (Am I allowed to bring cash to hire protesters in this fantasy?) Let people know their government is about to bring those towers down. Plant the seed. Get people out of there, pull fire alarms, call in bomb threats, whatever. Email as many news media outlets as I can, sending all the details we know today. </p>

<p>Then sit back and watch TPTB maneuver to fix their story.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter. To me it would still be more important to get people off the planes and out of the Towers. Forget about proving that it happened, I could save some lives. That has to come first, or you&#39;re as bad as they are.</p>

<p>I had said I&#39;d follow Larry Silverstein, but I read into it and he definitely lost somewhere in the neighborhood of ~3 billion USD. That kind of throws the whole insurance fraud thing out the window. </p>

<p>Has anyone given any credence to the official WTC 7 explanation? The TL;DR is that WTC 7 burned from the inside until it was a hollow, burned out husk and then collapsed in on itself. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last year I attended a lecture by William Rodriguez, last person out of WTC, he mentioned during the course of his presentation about <em>a section of floors that were off limits and maintenance personnel were given very strict orders that NO ONE was allowed to go there.</em>  He said when he was in the rooms <em>just under the restricted floors he could hear all kinds of noise above, to the point he was even scared.</em></p>

<p>Interviews of Rodriguez appear in the video &#39;9/11 Mysteries&#39;.</p>

<p>At 1hr20min, he says he heard <strong>&#39;heavy equipment&#39; noises on the 34th floor</strong> and did not open the door.</p>
