    <div class="md"><p>Everything is being set up for world war, thats for sure. </p>

<p>Yea, everyone talks softly (except for north korea, but hey, thats north korea for ya) but you can bet that with all these proxy wars goin on, and seemingly innocuous treaties that are in the works, something is being planned. The chess pieces are setting up on the board, and its just a matter of time until one side finds a lethal weakness in the other, and exploits it.</p>

<p>Lets go over some of the things that may be evidence towards this direction:</p>

<p><strong><em>America</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Since 9/11, there has been a plethora of new laws, regulations, and acts that serve the interest of the elite. They are hidden behind orwellian titles like &quot;the patriot act&quot; (the precursor to the NDAA i believe) which effectively eliminated habeas corpus, the right to a fair and speedy trial, by a jury of your peers. These class of acts take away the legal precedent set for centuries that was the maxim, &quot;innocent until provem guilty.&quot; Now, all that needs to happen for your indefinite detention, without wareants or notice to your kin, is the mere <em>suspicion</em> of being a terrorist or helping terrorists. </p></li>
<li><p>Obamacare: Destroying the middle class by hiking up health care premiums whilst decreasing effective coverage opens up vulnerabilities and increases the likelihood of bankruptcy. By eliminating the middle class, you create a much stronger and solid division between the rich (the elites) and the poor (everyone else). Tbis sets up much needed tension (from the elites point of view) in order to manipulate the masses into war, if need be. Through financial enslavement they have created a wilking, ignorant, and complacent populace to sacrifice.</p></li>
<li><p>Gun Control: By disarming the populace, you have a weaker defense, setting up for a more effective invasion. Not to mention, the UN small arms treaty could provide the exact medium inborder to get ue helmets and white vehicles onto american soil.</p></li>
<li><p>Immigration: Flooding the borders with illegal immigrants creats havoc within the justice system, providing justification for bigger government, i.e. DHS, which in turn will provide the elites with a larger standing army on our soil (which our fore fathers claimed many many times is a severe threat!!) larger than our military (in time, youll see). Also, by effectively opening the borders to a mass immigrantion invasion, you make it easier for terrorists to &quot;slip&quot; on by, setting up for a perfect false flag to get the poor folks all patiotic and shit and willing to go to war with whoever they are told is responsible for such a daring attack. (See 9/11 theories and the war on iraq)</p></li>
<li><p>Obama: The legality of his candidacy and thus his presidency provides just enough distrust within america to set the stage for martial law when/if enough folks get pissed off amd decide to do something about his reckless abandonment of constitutional responsibilities and for forsaking that precious document. </p></li>
<li><p>Martial Law: Once martial law is in place (which could happen in a million different ways), then america becomes a dictatorship, basically. Then, war is inevitable. It may begin only as a civil war, but thats the lethal weakness our enemies are waiting for. If its world war before civil war, at this point, then conscription woukd probably be reinstated, furthering the indentured nature of us peasants.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Russia</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>With allies like china and north korea and iran, they have the means, and the motive, to stir up trouble behind the scenes within america. A push over here, a tug over there, and america is fighting itself. Check mate. </p></li>
<li><p>Russias shit with the ukraine coukd provide evidence of this, as another proxy war on yet another front, russia and friends could be said to inconspicuously spreading our forces and attention quite thin, while never really investing too much on either front, saving his major chess pieces for the lethal attack. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>The Banksters</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>O the bankers! How thoughtful of them to make profits off the poor mans death. Orchestrating everything behind the scenes with the advantage of nonexistent geopolitical boundaries, they get to influence the game with no repurcussions. Theyll hide behind plausible deniability while insider trading will give them the tempo needed to stack the deck that is the world economy. Like a house of cards, the petrodollar is being stacked up and up. The higher the better, due to the increase of collateral damage to other nations, while russia and friends get to decide what the next reserve currency will be. Once the petrodollar falls, our economy tanks, immigration gets worse, people flip their shit, martial law, civil war, and checkmate.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>All of this is, of course, *</em>hypothetical***. I have a feeling everything is being geared for a russian/eastern victory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in if it&#39;s something effective like a boycott.</p>

<p>If an organized boycott of cable, cell phones, gasoline, fast food, cinema, professional sports, etc gets mass participation I&#39;d happily participate because this they feel.</p>

<p>But marching, it seems, does nothing anymore but make the people that participate in the march feel like they are doing something while TPTB just wait it out until said march is over.</p>

<p>TPTB aren&#39;t swayed by shame anymore. It used to be that they scurried from the lights like scared roaches but &quot;they&quot; aren&#39;t afraid anymore. It&#39;s not enough to JUST turn on the lights because they know we won&#39;t use our true agency to suffer and inconvenience ourselves in ways that force them to change.</p>
