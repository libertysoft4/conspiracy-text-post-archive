        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When a plane is destroyed over a war zone, the first assumption is that it was taken down by a surface-to-air missile. In this instance the Russian-backed Ukrainian rebels were the &quot;obvious&quot; culprits. Case closed, right? Wait a minute...</p>

<p>We learn that MH17 was deliberately put &quot;in harm&#39;s way&quot; by Ukrainian air-traffic control - taken over a war zone controlled by the enemy, at which point there was an explosion and it fell out of the sky. How convenient. </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t a (low probability event of a) remotely detonated explosion be ignored in favour of the obvious, but erroneous, assumption that the plane was shot down by the rebels? The answer is demonstrably, yes, it would.</p>

<p><strong>So, has anyone got any hard evidence that MH17 was taken down by a missile?</strong></p>

<p>N.B. Hard evidence does not include fancy graphics of the BUK missile system or media speculation about the movements of BUK mobile missile launchers - we know that both Ukrainian troops and rebels have them. I want to see hard evidence that that a BUK took down MH17, and if none is forthcoming, I think we should reconsider some of our assumptions about this event.</p>

<p>Bait and switch - false flag event to get UN into the Ukraine and on Russia&#39;s border. Probably hoping to affect BRICS in some negative fashion? We all know that starting WWIII would be quite profitable and would help at least decimate, if not annihilate world population.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve actually seen any evidence that couldn&#39;t be tampered proving a ground-&gt;air missile, nor air-&gt;air. But there is significant evidence to point to the plane being guided to a place it wouldn&#39;t have been normally, under any circumstances.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the globalresearch article goes into great detail on the very unlikely and impossible chance that it was the Ukrainian rebels that fired off the SAM at the airliner, they could only have seen it flying for 70 seconds, not enough time for the five minute warmup and targeting of a big SAM system.</p>

<p>and of course who benefits from the claimed shoot-down, not the rebels, not the Russians, Ukraine maybe, NATO maybe if they can incite war between Russia and Ukraine. (cash strapped Ukraine would lose, no doubt on that)</p>

<p>in the real world, everybody loses.</p>

<p>This is what the US military-industrial complex is hoping for, and actively working towards. </p>

<p>I am pretty sure the autopsy results (Netherlands) and the Black box analysis (AAIB/UK) are going to be withheld for as long as possible in the hope that a full scale conflict breaks out in Ukraine which NATO can get involved in. </p>
