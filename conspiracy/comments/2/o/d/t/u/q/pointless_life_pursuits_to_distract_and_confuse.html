<p>I have no money, so no one bothers me to try and get it.
I have no special skills or talents that can make money, so no 
one bothers me in order to use my talents.
I am not famous or special in the eyes of others, so no one trys

simply ideas of inclusivity and exclusivity that only cause 
disunity between the in-groups and out-groups.</p>

<p>the greatest puzzle of life is that everything you acquire and 
hold over the course of your life is lost. all of your beliefs, 
your relationships, your achievements, your possessions. all of 
it dissolved at death.</p>

<p>people know this.
yet people still strive after these things. its a form on 
insanity. clawing their way toward some hope of fulfillment in a 
temporary form.
This is the motivation of a economic society. this is why people 
work? climb the ladder to fame and fortune.
work everyday, build and build civilization without stopping to ask, why?</p>

<p>How can you ever achieve lasting fulfillment from temporary 
things or from existence in a body set to expire?</p>

<p>Yet people identify with their own temporary forms.
their complete sense of self is believed to be within a 
temporary form.
With this belief how can one not be afraid.
living in fear of certain annihilation.
knowing that everything they do and obtain will be lost.</p>

<p>and so we end up with this world full of fear, a society built 
around fear, which results in all of the violence and hatred 
that results. where people have to constantly defend their 
identity from annihilation. they are afraid to die. afraid to
let go of their things.
so we argue and fight and attack each other. </p>

<p>how can we find peace?
its so simple, yet people cant do it.
all we have to do is know ourselves, know who we truly are.
when you know who you are then none of those things matter.
to know that our identity is not in the temporary form.
the temporary form is only an expression of who we are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. Peace is simple.</p>

<p>All of what you&#39;re saying stems from a rejection of God. It is undeniable, even in modern science, that we and the universe are created by an eternal intelligence. Everything we have, especially what we eat, is all from Him. Instead of seeing it that way, we try to live without Him and work against each other for our own benefit... We should be working together for His benefit which in turn benefits us all.</p>

<p>This world cannot be in harmony unless we recognize our God and work to be in harmony with Him, for it is only harmony with God that can bring harmony within His creation. He&#39;s the one that created it, and He&#39;s the one that knows how it was intended to work!</p>

<p>He&#39;s also the only one that can save us from ourselves, and the only one that can save us from death. He&#39;s the only reason we&#39;re here at all and instead of being thankful, we piss it away to argue about who gets more of this or more of that. He will not tolerate our behavior much longer... and neither will creation.</p>

<p>We are unruly children in denial of the very solution to every problem we face because we don&#39;t want to accept the fact that we&#39;re not the top of the food chain. We should be absolutely grateful we&#39;re not at the top of the food chain.</p>

<p>Unfortunately as well as fortunately, I suppose, there will be no peace. We&#39;re on a runaway train falling off the side of a mountain. Thank God He sent His only begotten Son to offer us a gift of salvation through God&#39;s grace if we believe upon Him and are baptized in the blood of the lamb. He manifested here on Earth to show us the fallacy of our ways and save us should we realize He is right and ask Him for forgiveness.</p>

Most religious texts have some truth hidden in them, you just have to wade through a lot of excess and human error.
I don&#39;t support or align with any organized religion since they are always corrupted by human influence over time.

How can life exist without a creative intelligence?</p>

<p>actually its frightening to the individual ego.
people are actually afraid of who they really are.</p>

<p>God manifests itself in creative expression.
we are god expressing itself in order to know itself.

<p>Over a long enough timeline anything is possible. We know the building blocks of life are scattered throughout the universe and while its improbable that they combine randomly its not impossible. 1 billion years of random combinations will eventually produce the correct string for self replicating life. </p>

<p>Life is so amazing, you are the result of billions of years of evolution, just the perfect string of events leads up to us having this discussion. You are made of star dust, our sun is 3rd generation, this universe is amazing and the craziest part is there doesnt need to be a conductor! You are so unique that you are impossible, but again a long enough timeline in an infinite universe and you will happen. If that doesnt make you feel awe then nothing will. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;random combinations will eventually produce the correct string for self replicating life.&quot;</p>

<p>Your reasoning is flawed and I&#39;ll tell you why.</p>

<p>Modern mainstream science has a universal law called entropy. they teach it in school.
Entropy in summary is the reduction of a complex system into a more simple system, thereby &quot;liberating&quot; energy.</p>

<p>All of our known technologies are based on entropy. essentially the burning of fossil fuels, nuclear fission, etc.</p>

<p>Their universal law states that all energy can only go one direction!
AN entropic universe will eventually end up cold and dark with no life!</p>

<p>Modern science wholly ignores the thing called life. because they don&#39;t understand it or how it comes into being.
and it conflicts with their cold entropic theory of the universe.</p>

<p>life is the opposite of entropy. it is a creative, intelligent, self organizing energy that brings all life into being.
how else can seeds grow from a seed into a giant tree?</p>

<p>the &quot;law&quot; of entropy doesn&#39;t allow for self organization, so life could never randomly occur. 
science theory contradicts itself in a glaringly obvious way and no one seems to notice or care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been proven that life cannot arise without the hand of an intelligent designer. The simplest organism possible requires over three hundred parts to arise simultaneously in order to even exist, not to mention DNA itself is a language so complex we can&#39;t even read it. The universe cannot come from nothing, and the only solution to that is an inflation fallacy of multiverse upon multi-multiverse.</p>

<p>A chance based universe does not allow for anything to exist outside of time and space. We all share the same logic, but if we were just the product of chance and evolution logic wouldn&#39;t be possible. Your logic would be chemically different than mine in our brains and it wouldn&#39;t work. We all know it&#39;s wrong to rape children, and that&#39;s because morality is outside of time and space. It&#39;s a piece of God&#39;s nature. If we were the product of evolution and chemical processes, what&#39;s so wrong with me breeding slave children for my own sexual and murderous pleasure? They&#39;re just chemical accidents, right? Wrong.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve been duped without evidence, just a good argument. The evidence is so far in favor of a Creator it&#39;s undeniable. The fossil record is proof of global, catastrophic burial due to flooding and dating methods are so fallible it&#39;s laughable. You&#39;ve been indoctrinated into a worldview and need to go back and take a good hard look at the lens you view the world through.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Life isn&#39;t only impossible without a creator... the evidence lines up to support it. Evolutionism is provably wrong, we cannot date the Earth or rocks or the universe via scientific inquiry, and we cannot replicate life without life. I don&#39;t have to read the rantings of a vehement anti-creationism atheist to understand science and the universe. There is still not a single shred of evidence to propose the idea that life can arise without a creator. Not one, and far more evidence to the contrary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont need to be saved from anything. I live a good life and do no harm to others without needing to believe in him. I have not seen any evidence of a higher power and believe that life is just as rewarding without bending to arbitrary rules. </p>

<p>I find that many of his followers are some of the worst people I have met, I assume you mean the Christian God also?</p>

<p>There are too many religions to be confident that this one is more or less right than another, its all belief systems to get people in line with the societies they live in. Do you believe that people of other religions are bound for hell? What about the several hundred sects of Christianity? What about the several hundred versions of the bible? Is one more or less correct? </p>

<p>Too much ambiguity and not enough evidence. But again if it works for you more power to you, but again if Buddhism works for you or atheism or Judaism or any one of the thousands of religions out there more power to them also. </p>

<p>Im a very left brained thinker, I love facts and evidence. </p>

<p>Lets assume you were raised in a Jewish household wouldnt it be a fair assumption to say you would be here praising Yahweh? </p>

<p>God as you perceive it is most likely not real... How else would you explain the thousands of world religions? The insane stories and deaths in his name? You dont need God to be a good person is all Im trying to say, and you definitely dont need to be Christian to be a good person or find a path in life that makes you and the people around you happy. </p>

<p>Do you think people who dont accept Jesus or your God go to hell?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s the only one that tells us the beginning from the end. I wasn&#39;t raised Christian nor any other religion. Had I been raised Jewish I would still have had reason to question everything around me, and this is what I did. I thought critically and looked hard at all the facts and the evidence and drew the very last conclusion I was willing to accept: That the Holy Bible is the truth. Furthermore, the KJV is the most reliable in my language that has no err or contradiction.</p>

<p>There has been a conspiracy against God since the fall of man. Thousands of world religions have been propped up to muddy the water and conceal the truth. The largest Christian church on the planet is lying to their congregation, and is also pointed out in the very Holy book they profess as the synagogue of Satan.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to be a Christian to be a good person, no... but the Christian God is where morality comes from. Without him there is no such thing, because absolute morality is outside of time and space and is immaterial.</p>

<p>Hell is a second death. It&#39;s everlasting death. If you don&#39;t accept your God as the Most High, LORD of lords, then you&#39;re saying you will not harken unto His voice or obey His command. That&#39;s the original sin... disobedience to God. The punishment for sin is death.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all very simple and logical, as well as recorded. People from all faiths come to find the truth in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>I take issue with your statement that morality comes from a Christian God is founded on  your belief system, your faith, not logic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My eyes are opened by my faith. You think it&#39;s blindness because you can&#39;t see, nor do you want to.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say morality comes from my belief system. I said morality is from God and is outside of time and space, as is logic.</p>

<p>In a purely natural world born of itself there could exist nothing outside of time and space. Morality and logic exist because God is outside of time and space and he defines them. They are a gift from Him to us and witness to His existence.</p>

<p>Otherwise logic would be relative, which it is not. Same goes for morality.</p>

I like the term inversion. people lives are spent turned away from God. I don&#39;t know if you can always call it a rejection of god. I think sometimes people don&#39;t even know what they have done. They have just simply lost their way, not so much rejecting.
Anyway I guess that&#39;s what hell could be considered to be then. to turn away from god, live an upside down existence, where really all suffering is self inflicted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What evidence makes you think Jesus A. Ever existed and B. Is the Son of God. Who is God, and why would he create another son with magical powers to convince the other sons to follow? If we are all created in his image are we not all his &quot;sons&quot; (well, males at least, lol) and created equally? So what makes this son any better than the others? And where do females/ daughters fall in? Are females second class? How could they be when we know, that only females can birth. If God created Eve from Adam, wouldn&#39;t it be logical that the male is the one who &quot;creates&quot; the human and not Eve (the female). Why did he not &quot;create&quot; twins, one male and one female?</p>

<p>There are so many things wrong with Religion and the insanity behind such beliefs. I&#39;m spiritual, believe in a creator. But Jesus being the &quot;son&quot; of God, give me a break. If you do any research into the topic, you&#39;ll see it&#39;s probable the Romans were responsible for conjuring up this religion to qualm the Jewish revolts in occupied territory. I think you need to step out of bible study and do some intellectual research and open your mind to the possibility that what you&#39;re believing in could very well be against the creator. As goes with all &quot;religions&quot;. Each one thinks their messiah, rituals, etc etc are the only way into God&#39;s grace. I think it&#39;s foolish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are extra-biblical sources confirming Jesus&#39; existence. Jesus was the son of God and was God manifest in the flesh. We are created in his likeness, yes. He manifested into flesh to live a sinless life and show us a perfect example, then sacrifice Himself as the only perfect man in order to give us salvation in Him, as we are all sinners. It shows that only by God&#39;s love and grace may we be saved from damnation. Jesus knew what was coming, and He knew the times we are living in now back then. It&#39;s impossible for any of us to be righteous and none are. Not one. None of us deserve Heaven, but by believing upon Him we have a chance to make it.</p>

<p>He created Eve from Adam so that he wouldn&#39;t be alone. It also set a precedent for marriage that the two were one flesh and that the woman was part of the man, not the other way around.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not insanity. It&#39;s the truth. If you actually studied what you&#39;re arguing against you might understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, don&#39;t imply that I have not studied. I was born and raised a Catholic and went to Catholic schools from K-8. I&#39;ve learned plenty about the Catholic/Christian religion and am probably more versed in the intellectual arguments and logical fallacies you will find within. With that being said.....</p>

<p>The whole story of the Bible in which you speak of is that it was written many years later, by men who were not even of Jesus&#39; time. These are second, third, and some times forth hand stories of a figure. It is no different than the Greeks believing in the mythology that the Titans where defeated by the Olympians because the elders say so. It&#39;s mythology and and the intellectualism that actually existed, whether this man (Jesus) did exist, gets lost in magical fairy tales. Every story has a dash of truth, and I think this was the case. Do I personally think Jesus existed? Yes, I do. Do I think he was the &quot;son&quot; of god? No, he tapped into what God designed for all of us. We do not need to go through Christ, we need to tap into what Jesus tapped into. That is that we are all created in his image, with his knowledge. This is the key. God gave us minds to think. We are doing him a disservice by following group mentality of religion. God/ The Creator wants us to use the gifts he has given us, and that is within, the very being he created. We hold the key, we hold the knowledge, we need to tap into ourselves and our being to truly execute Gods plan. We do not need to believe that by praying to one man, or one messiah, or one imam that we will get into heaven.</p>

<p>Think about what you are saying. God says, you shall not have any other gods before me. Yet, you pray not unto him, but unto his son, Jesus. This is the very act of which God is saying you shall not do. Talk directly to him/her/it/wtf ever. You do not need to play telephone and go through a third party. This is the problem I have with all religions. Each one of you have a third party, why not just talk to him directly? He loves you and wants a relation ship. So... talk to it. This is like in middle school where my friend goes to the friend of a girl I like and says, I know someone that knows someone that like likes emily. Then emily&#39;s friend, goes to emily and says I heard from brad that he knows someone that knows someone that likes you. It&#39;s fucking childish and you are not tapping into what the creator/god has given you. You are not using your intellect he has given you to think for yourself and come to peace with your self, you would rather rely on ceremonies, rituals, and old paper to give you directions in this world. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but there are no directions and anyone telling you that there are, is a snake oil salesman. The idea is within you, the knowledge is within you, the power is within you. Because god has put it there. It is your mission as a human created by god to find it and tap into it.</p>

<p>That explains a lot. Catholocism is hardly reminiscent of Christianity whatsoever. They fall so short of Biblical doctrine that it is well within the range of blasphemy. I apologize if this seems overly critical or hurtful, but it is the truth. Revelation speaks of the Catholic Church as the Synagogue of Satan and calls the Papacy the Antichrist for a reason.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not playing telephone through a third party. Jesus, the Holy Spirit, and the Father are one. Jesus was the Father manifest in the flesh guided by the Holy Spirit. It is through Jesus&#39; sacrifice that our sins may be forgiven, and only God can forgive your sins. We must repent, accept Him, and be baptized!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yet you sound as though you don&#39;t even understand Christianity, and I don&#39;t think you do. Our salvation is not within ourselves... our salvation lies with God. That&#39;s the point. It&#39;s his mercy upon us that saves us, it&#39;s not our self-righteousness. None of us are righteous and all of us are damnable... nothing can change that except for God&#39;s mercy. He is the one who chooses who lives and who dies, so He gave us a choice.</p>

<p>God only asks that you repent of your sin and believe in Him, that He sent His son Jesus Christ to die for our sins so that we may be saved by His grace and purity, and be baptized in the name of the LORD.</p>

<p>You can do that and form a relationship with Him, or you can die an eternal death. It&#39;s logical. Obey the one who created you or you choose to be damned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, I&#39;m baptized, have said prayers, rehearse the same old shit you are spouting. It&#39;s all bullshit, and yes I understand Christianity pretty well. Can I ask you something? Who is the LORD? Why do I need to be baptized to be in good grace with him? Is he baptizing me or is a priest/pastor? Who gave that person power I do not have? Can I hop in my bath tub and baptize myself? No, I can&#39;t because the faith requires some one who is more &quot;learned&quot; in the belief then I am? Seriously? What makes a pastor more learned then me? Did you know most pastors and priests rob from the ministry? Give your tithe, allow me to bestow &quot;my knowledge&quot; and power on you, because in a book it say I have more power over you, you little man.</p>

<p>Christianity died with Jesus, and what you are believing in is man&#39;s word. Go ahead, follow man. Even though, the creator tells you not too. In my mind you are the antagonist, you are the very satan you wish to portray on others, because you are following mans rules, beliefs, and dogmas. I&#39;m following the mind the creator gave me. Put that in your pipe and smoke it. Wait you can&#39;t because you think it&#39;s wrong, put that in your bible and pray upon it. Good riddance child, you are lost and so far from the true words. I pity you, and so does your creator.</p>
