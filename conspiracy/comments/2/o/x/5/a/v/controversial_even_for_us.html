<p>We can speak freely about 9-11 truth here because the mods protect this space against people who would have it otherwise.  So when you see something you don&#39;t like, don&#39;t be so quick to become that guy who tries to shut down the conversation.</p>

<p>We can speak freely about Sandy Hook because the mods protect this space against people who would have it otherwise.  When you find something you don&#39;t like, don&#39;t be so quick to try and shut it down.</p>

<p>We can speak freely here about UFOs and Aliens, We can speak freely about CIA torture and Israeli aggression. etc etc etc.</p>

<p>This latest AMA (The announcement for Cole) that has so many feelings hurt isn&#39;t any different.  If something here offends you then YOU need to click on a different page, a different article or maybe even just take a break from reddit.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t fair for you to enjoy this space when the topic is something that you are interested in and then to flip a switch and make this space a miserable place when the topic moves on to something that you find offensive.</p>

<p>9-11 conspiracies are offensive to people.
Sandy Hook conspiracies are offensive to people.
Boston bombing conspiracies are offensive to people.
anti-government/military conspiracies are offensive to people.</p>

<p>So when you get offended, be careful not to become the troll that ruins your own favorite subjects.  And if you do become that troll, don&#39;t be offended a second time if you get removed from the conversation.</p>

<p>Some things are controversial, even for us.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question.</p>

<p>Because of my mutant mod powers, I have the ability to &quot;see&quot; comments from users that either are new or shadowbanned accounts.</p>

<p>These comments appear &quot;faded&quot; compared to normal users. If you&#39;re a mod in any sub, you can see them.</p>

<p>To prevent constant account creation and brigading in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, new users have to wait a few days before posting to the sub. After that point they&#39;re not restricted.</p>

<p>As mods, we can see these new users and their posts. I almost always approve these comments and posts, as long as the poster seems genuine.</p>

<p>However, if a comment is faded out and clicking the user name brings me the dreaded &quot;page not found&quot; screen, I automatically know the user has been shadowbanned.</p>

<p>At this point, I approve the user&#39;s comment (as long as it&#39;s appropriate, which it almost always is), and then I inform them of their situation.</p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty much the limit of what we can do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One side benefit of shadowbanning (if I understand this correctly) is that the banned user usually doesn&#39;t realize that it&#39;s happened. I would guess that it might take them a while before they realize nobody is responding to their comments.</p>

<p>This should delay them from setting up a new account for at least a little while.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s essentially a &quot;punishment&quot; that can only be given by the admins of reddit. </p>

<p>Users can be shadowbanned for a variety of reasons, and they generally have to do with breaking reddit&#39;s terms of service, such as brigading, doxxing, and other dastardly deeds.</p>

<p>I think sometimes IP addresses are blocked as well, so newly created accounts from the same location are similarly screwed.</p>

<p>Shadowbanned users can, however, message the mods of any subreddit. These messages are shaded with a reddish pink color that&#39;s really obvious. </p>

<p>The <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod mail is frequently spammed by shadowbanned users. </p>

<p>Sometimes, however, shadowbans are unjust or mistakes. Some users opt to contact the reddit admins, plead their case, and the bans can be reversed.</p>

<p>As it happens, certain &quot;types&quot; have been trying to get me shadowbanned for years now. </p>

<p>But since I haven&#39;t broken any rules, their efforts are just silly. The year+ worth of reddit gold I&#39;ve been given probably helps my account&#39;s standing as well.</p>

<p>I hope that clears a few things up. If I got anything wrong maybe someone will chime it and correct me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like in the film the Sixth Sense. For a shadowbanned user their account appears normal - they are able post comments and so on, upvote etc. However, nobody else can see them (or their comments) and if you click on a shadowbanned user&#39;s comment page you get &quot;page not found&quot;. In other words, it might take some time for a shadowbanned to user to even realise they&#39;re...dead. Mods, however, see dead people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;If it&#39;s free, you&#39;re the product.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve accepted this as well - the problem comes because reddit has a reputation (that it&#39;s worked hard to cultivate) of being user-driven where posts are voted on organically and peoples&#39; opinions are reflected in the vote totals for comments and posts.</p>

<p>But this is simply fiction.  It&#39;s not how the site works at all.  And in my opinion it says something about the admins that they allow so much corporate shilling and vote manipulation to occur.  Maybe I&#39;m imaging it but it&#39;s all seemed to have gotten worse since Aaron died.</p>

<p>Christianity is a false religion designed to destroy true spirituality. It is a religion designed to make the &quot;Gentile&quot; a slave who worships the Jewish false god Yahweh, a sacrificial lamb for his demonic lordship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That may even be the most likely interpretation. However, I tend to think of Yahweh and Ra as the same evil spiritual entity, who goes by many names.

<p>Astrology does interest me. And it seems that the &quot;elite&quot; are quite infatuated with it, and with the gods as well. Lots of things indicate that astrology/astronomy is a lot more important to our everyday lives than science might have us believe.</p>

<p>How familiar are you with ancient history/archaeology/politics (both greco-roman and far east)?</p>

<p>You sorta need to know the political systems of the past or else you just won&#39;t understand any evidence or specifics. If you&#39;re not aware that, for example: jesus is made up and mostly pagan, zoroastrian and political attributes (augustus + flavian dynasty mainly) etc. you&#39;re going to have difficulty understanding the political relevance. </p>

<p>The Gnostics were sort of the political equivalents to... truthers or maybe humanists! I say <em>political</em> as in how they operate not their beliefs. A tiny minority reformist group that stands <em>against</em> the accepted <em>immoral</em>, <em>unjust</em> etc. but is still sorta corrupt, filled with bullshit, money scheming etc. </p>

<p>Just as dogmatic as the rest, just not as <em>hazardous</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! Christianity in its early stages was a fairly populist movement of individual &#39;spiritual&#39; activity (or at least locally decentralized with an evangelical) but the establishment of the many archbishoprics around the Mediterranean later on created regional dogma, which was then polarized between East and West (Roman Catholicism).</p>

<p>By the schism, pretty much all dissenting sects not conforming to the dialectic were wiped out and their texts for the most part too.

    <div class="md"><p>Mmmyea exactly. Basically as you explained it, early christianity was actually a Caesarian cult trying to convince jews that the flavian dynasty were their messiah... as imaginable that didn&#39;t go down too well so they had to heavily change it&#39;s dogma in order for it to convert a large number of levantine people. However it was always just a roman controlled sect of generic judaism until much later when <em>someone</em> (before constantine, speculated to be a political body (oligarchs) linked to the old Mithras cult, based on political mannerisms and such there is a hint of some persian involvement too) completely changed it. They introduced new mythology, incorporating new rituals and beliefs based on other local religions (paganism, zoroastrianism, mithrazism etc.). This is also when their founder &#39;st. paul/saul&#39; and messiah &#39;Jesus (Yeshua)&#39; first appears (about 100-150ish years after their apparent existence, leading archaeologists to believe they were both made up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the moderators don&#39;t apply the rules equally to all users. I personally have been targeted and warned for BS twice. I started reporting a lot of users for personal attacks after I was told that even calling someone &quot;ignorant&quot; is a personal attack (if I do it at least), but they are almost never warned, even though their attacks are far more offensive, proving I was targeted specifically. The moderators aren&#39;t really doing their jobs. Worse, they&#39;re targeting users like me who they disagree with instead of applying the rules fairly. They are even changing the enforcement of the rules specifically to attack me. They also don&#39;t seem to believe they have any accountability whatsoever.

<p>Well, the moderators don&#39;t apply the rules equally to all users. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.  There&#39;s the quantitative application of some rules (where almost anyone will get the ban hammer if they do &quot;such and such&quot;) and qualitative application (where other factors get weighed as well and sometimes the ban hammer won&#39;t get dropped on one user where it would on another).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was told that even calling someone &quot;ignorant&quot; is a personal attack (if I do it at least), but they are almost never warned</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well...that&#39;s...weird, and I wonder if there is more to the whole situation than being warned simply for calling someone &quot;ignorant&quot;...because I myself can be a fucking <em>flllaaaaaring</em> asshole on here (lol), and even though I&#39;ve been warned before, I think I would have been banned a LOOOONG time ago if calling someone &quot;ignorant&quot; was a bannable offense...cuz I&#39;ve called many people a LOT more than just &quot;ignorant&quot;. lol</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but they are almost never warned, even though their attacks are far more offensive, proving I was targeted specifically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ohhh.  Wait a minute...I just noticed your user name.  I <em>think</em> you and I might have gotten into a bit of a &quot;spat&quot; not too long ago (if I remember correctly - which I may not, since there are literally SOOO damn many people that I get in online &quot;spats&quot; with) and I think I remember feeling that you were being pretty nit pickingly antagonistic...or something.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know.  Again, I don&#39;t really remember what the conversation was even about - and really I don&#39;t even care, in all honesty - but, if (again) I&#39;m even <em>vaguely</em> remembering correctly, I think your approach to conversations with other people on here is generally antagonistic in nature...even if you&#39;re not specifically calling people bannable things, you know?</p>

<p>As such, I think you might fall under the &quot;qualitative&quot; parameters I mentioned above.</p>

<p>That being said, the moderators AREN&#39;T by any means perfect, so it&#39;s not like I&#39;m sticking up for any individual in particular here.  I&#39;m just calling the shots as I personally see them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are even changing the enforcement of the rules specifically to attack me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a few immediate perspectives with regard to this possibility:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They are and that is indeed pretty fucked up.</p></li>
<li><p>They&#39;re not, and you&#39;re 1) a pretty shitty user, and 2) being a bit paranoid.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m not saying which one it is, as I don&#39;t know for sure myself (so don&#39;t get upset or offended, because I&#39;m <em>not</em> saying that the second option is necessarily the case), just saying that there <em>are</em> different sides to every story is all.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t feel it was your being &quot;blunt&quot; that was an issue.  I think it was something else - though I don&#39;t remember what.  It wasn&#39;t the bluntness.  It, I think, might have been either sarcasm or some snarkiness or whatever.</p>

<p>Either way, it&#39;s all good.  Not worrying about that at this point at all.</p>

<p>But one should definitely understand and keep in mind the law of balances.  If you have group A that takes advantage of group B for generations, and you want to make some attempt at <em>balancing</em> that horrendous <em>imbalance</em> that A was responsible for, then you actually <em>have</em> to institute various programs designed to RE-balance B in such a manner that they are now given opportunities that they weren&#39;t given before; opportunities that A might not get...but that&#39;s only because A <em>started off</em> in a position of power and authority that B never had ever <em>at all</em>.</p>

<p>Does that make sense?</p>

<p>It&#39;s, in one sense, imbalanced and &quot;unfair&quot; that B gets certain concessions that A doesn&#39;t, but the reason that B gets those particular concessions is because A is advantaged overall to an extent that B has <em>never</em> been in the first place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is one contentious topic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When one doesn&#39;t think about it too deeply, I guess it does and would seem like a contentious topic.  However, when one looks at the issue objectively, one understands more that there is a great imbalance that is trying to be re-balanced, and, as such, things end up being similar to how things are now regarding this issue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Others are leftism and the jewish question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know much - and don&#39;t care to know much - about the whole &quot;right&quot; v &quot;left&quot; thing.  I think it&#39;s all bullshit and they&#39;re both two hands on the same evil, manipulative machine.</p>

<p>And as far as the &quot;jewish question&quot;?...is that a topic that, as you say, you get &quot;fed up with the sheeple who...&quot;...who what?  Who talk about it?  Just trying to get an idea of what you mean here is all.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In a past life we may have been friends.  We can be friends in <em>this</em> life too.</p>

<p>No. The system does not rebalance anything. It punishes innocent people like me who never had slaves for being white. That is not justice. Justice is easy - the people are just stupid. Injustice is not justice no matter how you twist it, that should really be obvious.</p>

<p>The punishment you experience is likely almost nothing compared to that which many African Americans do as a result of the endemic, violent, oppressive, and institutionalized racism and slavery that was set in motion from as far back as the initial forming of the United States and is <em>still</em> very much existent today.</p>

<p>Not saying you or I or whoever else who isn&#39;t African American <em>doesn&#39;t</em> experience difficulty, but about the only race in America worse off than the African American race is the native population.  America is <em>still</em> an EXTREMELY racist country...in an extremely racist world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is not justice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What continues to happen every single day today to African Americans is even less justice - and it is a result of, again, the endemic violence and racism that they have been subject to since they arrived in this country.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Justice is easy - the people are just stupid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once the facts of a case are laid out, justice can indeed be or seem easy.  People often do seem stupid.  Things are pretty complicated, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Injustice is not justice no matter how you twist it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I cannot agree more, and what Europeans have been responsible for is an injustice that runs so multi-generationally deep that it will not and has not gone away just because a few decades have passed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that should really be obvious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is.  Very.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yet leftism still exists and it is a major problem especially for Redditards.</p>

<p>And so does rightism - or whatever tf one calls it.</p>

<p>Either way, it ultimately doesn&#39;t matter because we should ALL simply put aside our bs indoctrinated &quot;isms&quot; and come together as the ONE human race that we most definitely are.

<p>Okay wait a minute.  You don&#39;t think it&#39;s due to racism.  This implies, however, that you DO think that African Americans DO have it a lot worse than Europeans (just not &quot;due to racism&quot;).</p>

<p>What?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In one sense, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s valuable at all either.  I&#39;d prefer to not compare ANY racism of ANY people, as I feel we&#39;re all ONE PEOPLE AND ONE FAMILY.  However, I think it&#39;s even more important to make sure and <em>stomp racism out entirely</em> first...and you can&#39;t stomp it out without first ACKNOWLEDGING ITS EXISTENCE...and you can&#39;t acknowledge the existence of the horrible racism that exists against African Americans by spending too much if any time trying to make it seems like Europeans have it worse (!?!? Wut? lol).</p>

<p>No one&#39;s saying that Europeans don&#39;t have problems.  We ALL have problems.  However, in terms of the issue of racism in the United States, there are two groups that have had it worse than ANYONE - the natives and African Americans - and anyone even TRYING to say otherwise just...simply is NOT paying any attention to almost <em>anything</em> whatsoever.</p>

<p>Seems like a decent idea to me.  Of course there will be many that will get their panties in a wad about that.  <em>Good</em>.  That&#39;s likely an indicator that they want to be able to post whatever they want from sock puppets - preventing which is the whole point of instating that rule.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I enjoy questioning theories to test their merit under scrutiny. Some people aren&#39;t fond of that, but questioning is all part of an honest discussion. Scrutinizing is part of honest discourse. And anyone who questions the ideas here is called a shill or something similar. That is not ok because as soon as you start calling people shills,  the conversation can go no farther. If name calling is the first response, then the theory probably doesn&#39;t hold much water. Discussion is the key.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A point that needs to be made is the contradiction between the sentiments of &quot;up or down vote everything you see here&quot; and &quot;if you don&#39;t like it, go somewhere else.&quot;</p>

<p>I know there are content rules overall for the sub, and I understand that your post here is probably geared more towards the comments and the conversation, however the lines that still seem to exist (unwritten or overt) seem to me to be hurting the sub almost as much as the shills.</p>

<p>In my opinion, we need more detailed conversation. So when a post comes up that says something like &quot;9/11 was done by Echelon with holographic planes from satellites in outer space,&quot; down vote it sure, but put forth evidence in the comments to correct the person to a more likely theory.</p>

<p>If we just abolish every post that leans a little too far out there, those people (if they&#39;re NOT shills) will leave us, rather than be educated on the scientific method and realistic speculation. </p>

<p>tl;dr: If we get too overzealous, we&#39;ll likely lose members and end up looking like the neck beards we&#39;re trying to fight against.</p>

<p>This statement applies to two situations, if something is highly up voted and you don&#39;t like.. oh well! Go somewhere else! No need to shit up the comments section and spam the report button.  And the other situation is, if you are here in /conspiracy and all you ever do is down vote stuff (you know who you are) then why exactly are you here in the first place?  Go somewhere else.</p>

<p>I responded to that. I&#39;ll let the mods speak for themselves about warnings. It seems to me that you&#39;re just trying to find a reason to be angry. The mods already give trolls too much leeway. I personally think all trolls should be banned. </p>

<p>Rule 10.</p>

<p>This comment was 4 months ago, it had nothing to do with the Hitler documentary.</p>

<p>You&#39;re telling me that your main account was 2 years old but never made a comment until a 2 day period that started 4 months ago, and immediately started talking about how &quot;conspiracy really hates the Jews&quot; and you feel like this was unjust?</p>

<p>We ban these sleeper accounts all the time, we see them on a daily basis.  I think your whole story just unraveled before our eyes.</p>

<p>So since that isn&#39;t the account that got banned for &quot;politely voicing your concerns about the Hitler documentary&quot; would you care to keep listing your banned accounts so that we can get to the bottom of this unjust ban you keep talking about?</p>

<p>Why doesn&#39;t your story about being unjustly banned for voicing concerns about the Hitler documentary, match up with the actual events that took place?  Could it be that you&#39;ve had so many accounts banned here for trolling, that you&#39;ve lost track of which is what?</p>

We are complaining about you and axol_p pushing Holocaust revisionism by pinning an AMA at the top of this sub, right after faking a Richard Gage AMA, and you&#39;re the same mods who threw up a red hitler poster and hitler revisionist doc during 9/11. You banned multiple users including me for calling out these failures as mods. Your judgement is poor and the power you hold is too much for you and your buddy. </p>

<p>Discussing topics is different than pinning shitty holocaust AMAs after faking a Gage AMA. You cussed me out and gave me zero warnings before banning me and others. </p>

<p>I think I have done this in the past before, and I&#39;ve gotten  a lot better about that kind of thing. 
Just because I think something doesn&#39;t mean that I&#39;m correct because my ego tells me that I&#39;m right. 
I think a lot of people suffer from that. </p>

<p>Anyway, I will do my best to keep this kind of thing down on my part. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s essentially a &quot;punishment&quot; that can only be given by the admins of reddit. </p>

<p>Users can be shadowbanned for a variety of reasons, and they generally have to do with breaking reddit&#39;s terms of service, such as brigading, doxxing, and other dastardly deeds.</p>

<p>I think sometimes IP addresses are blocked as well, so newly created accounts from the same location are similarly screwed.</p>

<p>Shadowbanned users can, however, message the mods of any subreddit. These messages are shaded with a reddish pink color that&#39;s really obvious. </p>

<p>The <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod mail is frequently spammed by shadowbanned users. </p>

<p>Sometimes, however, shadowbans are unjust or mistakes. Some users opt to contact the reddit admins, plead their case, and the bans can be reversed.</p>

<p>As it happens, certain &quot;types&quot; have been trying to get me shadowbanned for years now. </p>

<p>But since I haven&#39;t broken any rules, their efforts are just silly. The year+ worth of reddit gold I&#39;ve been given probably helps my account&#39;s standing as well.</p>

<p>I hope that clears a few things up. If I got anything wrong maybe someone will chime it and correct me.</p>
