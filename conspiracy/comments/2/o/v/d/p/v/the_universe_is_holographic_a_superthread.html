        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey guys. I know I have been sneaking in <a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a> posts in here constantly to try and stir some attention to the theory. I decided to try and flesh it all out, and what it all means. If you haven&#39;t heard of this theory, please take some time to read this post. If you have and dismissed it, <strong>please</strong> bring up any points of contention to me.</p>

<p><strong>I am not doing this because I think everyone should know physics and because I want to be right. I am doing this because the implications of this theory address the main issues, the root issues, that are in psychonaut&#39;s faces. Mainly, that we are accidental meat-bodies in a disconnection from everything. And second, that we will never be able to have free energy due to entropy and newton&#39;s laws, where Nassims theory shows that the vacuum energy predictions of QFT are real and not bunk. See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_catastrophe">Vacuum Catastrophe</a> and that radiant energy is real</strong></p>

<p>I am going to attempt show the major differences between our current standard model and the fractal holographic theory to my understanding.</p>

<p>The main tenant of the theory is that space and matter are a light lattice of planck units. The planck is the smallest possible fluctuation we are able to conceive of and apply a distance to in physics. It has a know size and mass. It is a constant This is a quantization of the electromagnetic field. To imagine how small a planck is, if you blow it up to the size of a proton, the proton that this planck was a part of would stretch from here to alpha centauri. &lt;-- period is halfway between the size of the observable universe and the planck length. </p>

<p>The problem is, when you try and calculate how much energy of plancks would be in a cc<sup>3</sup> of space, when adding up planck units, you get 10<sup>93</sup> grams. This is absurdly high - so high, it has been called the worst prediction of physics. </p>

<p>What Nassim does is start with these spherical planck units as the basis for a light-space-time lattice that stretches in all directions. No empty space. </p>

<p>When he attempted to calculate how these quantized bits could give mass to the matter that we see around us, he unlocked or revealed a hidden property of the Universe, it is holographic.</p>

<p>If you add up the fluctuations that fit in the nucleus of an atom, in the proton, you get 10<sup>55</sup> grams. This is the mass of the observable Universe. It is holographically represented in the proton by means of planck fluctuations. </p>

<p>On this line, if you apply the holographic principle to the proton (that is, the surface area of the proton can fully represent the volume information) by simply dividing the surface plancks by volume plancks (think of the area as &#39;ports&#39; that pull through the mass of the volume), and multiplying by the planck mass, you get the rest mass of the proton, 1.602×10<sup>-24</sup> grams. <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2+*+%284.7116551*10%5E40+*+planck+mass%29+%2F+1.2804*10%5E60">Here it is on wolfram alpha</a> If you reverse the holographic principle, you can deduce the mass of Cygnus X-1 - starting with plancks, to get 1.683*10<sup>34</sup> grams. </p>

<p>Now the important thing is that this makes the proton a singularity, a black hole. <strong>Each bit of information that falls into a singularity is represented in each singularity (the information, or EM wave). via holographic information</strong> The singularities are in contact with each other through the superfluid, superconducting light lattice that stretches in all directions - as a standing wave. There is math to show this as well.</p>

<td>Space/Field</td>
<td>Nassims theory implicates a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfluidity">superfluid</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity">superconducting</a> lattice of spherical PSU&#39;s stretching in all directions. A recent article on scientific american <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/superfluid-spacetime-relativity-quantum-physics/">Would a superfluid unify physics?</a> A current model of this theory in the mainstream is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity">loop quantum gravity</a> Matter arises from this field through spinning into existence, giving it relativistic mass compared to the surrounding field. Electromagnetism is a fluctuation of the spinning plancks through this lattice.</td>
<td>The vacuum of space is empty, all matter was created instantly in a single moment, electromagnetism propogates through the vacuum of space. Quantum virtual particles can pop into and out of existence here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mass</td>
<td>Nassims theory shows that it is the spin of space that allows mass to arise. Everything is a harmonic oscillator, that looks like a dual torus of implosion and expansion. Not a solid sphere, but a resulting sphere from <a href="http://vacuumsingularity.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/u4bubble.gif?w=450">this</a> Matter is space, spinning and curling. Matter is light, spinning and curling</td>
<td>Unknown. We think that the elusive higgs field brings mass to particles, but we have yet to nail it down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Black holes</td>
<td>Einstein&#39;s field equation solutions that were found, were solved with the Schwartzchild solution. This solution showed that everything in space was part of a singularity curve that would eventually coallesce into infinity. In Nassims theory, almost every self-sustained system is either a black hole or a virtual black hole. However, these black holes are not the traditional funnel towards nothingness, they are an implosion/explosion towards (due to a twisting funneling that can be seen in the gif above) a single planck that is not spinning relative to the plancks around it, emulating a vacuum of space. This makes them stable, and from outside the event horizon could be a star (the white hole or radiation outwards), or a proton.</td>
<td>Singularity has lost its meaning, because the equations show that all matter is part of a singularity curve, there should be only one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dark Energy</td>
<td>In Nassims theory, dark energy is explained 100%, or the extra expansion/spin we see in the Universe. If you simply take a 10<sup>55g</sup> proton, and blow it up to the size of our Universe, you end up with the exact energy density to satisfy the dark energy force. This implicates that perhaps our Universe started as a proton in a high density other Universe, and popped out, causing massive expansion due to the pressure difference.</td>
<td>Unknown. We place an X in our equations equivelent to the fluctuations we see previously. Starting to be linked to the vacuum fluctuations of space.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gravity</td>
<td>In Nassims theory, gravitation has been literally linked to geometry of space. These spinning protons cause a tension in the planck lattice, causing dimples on the surface of a sphere, that causes flow towards it</td>
<td>Unknown <em>causality</em>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Strong Force/Quantum Mechanics</td>
<td>In Nassims theory, the strong force is simply another facet of gravitation at the very micro scales, due to the spinning proton. Two protons orbiting each other cause the exact mass to satisfy this force, 10<sup>14</sup> grams. If you spin the standard mass proton to the speed of light, you get the 10<sup>14</sup> grams, the perfect mass to satisfy this. Further, nuclear emission rates are characteristic of the time it takes for one orbital, as is the strong force interaction period.</td>
<td>Unknown. This is where most of Quantum Physics arises from, attempting to explain how such energetic particles like protons could stick together. So we came up with a force, mediated by &#39;gluons&#39; with the exact force to satisfy this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sacred Geometry/Phi Fibonacci</td>
<td>Literally the structure of space itself. These spinning plancks cause standing waves, that we can see in <em>cymatics</em> that make light vibrate geometry into existence. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGGvwkrDZNA">first fractal iteration of the lattice is a 64 tetrahedron grid from which the flower of life and metatrons cube can be extracted.</a> The platonic solids and molecular bonding angles are literally due to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZPtBwMLwAI">12 points of tension that arise in the proton.</a> The flower of life are the spherical plancks that are at each node of the geometry of the male geometrical structure - <a href="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/B7v7s1weUW8/maxresdefault.jpg">the temple of Osiris flower of life</a> is an <a href="http://vacuumsingularity.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/holo-flower-2.jpg?w=425&amp;h=398">exact match</a>.</td>
<td>Bunk, silly woo.  Pattern recognition</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Consciousness</td>
<td>This is getting into speculation, but this planck lattice makes up everything, and it is a hyper-instantaneous-information network. I&#39;ll let you speculate on consciousness taking the form of it&#39;s vessel.</td>

<blockquote>
<p>In theoretical physics, geometrodynamics is an attempt to describe spacetime and associated phenomena completely in terms of geometry. Technically, its goal is to unify the fundamental forces and reformulate general relativity as a configuration space of three-metrics, modulo three-dimensional diffeomorphisms. It was enthusiastically promoted by John Wheeler in the 1960s, and work on it continues in the 21st century.</p>

<p>First it means new technology that somehow harnesses the radiant vacuum energy is possible.</p>

<p>Second it literally means the entire information set of the universe is present at every point.</p>

<p>It means life isn&#39;t an accident, complexification is what the Universe does by saving it&#39;s state in a holographic storage media that is instantaneously entangled with all singularities.</p>

<p>It means consciousness is probably not local, but something intrinsic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, it&#39;s not meant that way. Your &quot;self&quot; is an illusion created by divide, by duality, by your human vessel. You&#39;ll go back into the oneness that is all, the eternal &quot;source&quot;, infinite awareness, the singularity. That&#39;s how I understand it anyway, but I haven&#39;t died so don&#39;t quote me on that ;) I&#39;m just speaking from my own learnings and experiences. To me, this has been proven to myself through introspection and the study of the numerous parallels between all of the different schools of thought of philosophy, science and religion, but I also acknowledge the fact that maybe I&#39;m wrong, maybe I&#39;m just a dumb monkey who can&#39;t know anything about anything and is in a perpetual state of self illusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The universe we see is a subset, a result of a larger reality, with an all encompassing consciousness? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand the implications of saying &quot;life isn&#39;t an accident&quot; - as in, life as we know it is just a by-product of something else? But if that something else is &quot;an accident&quot;, any subset of that would be too, right? </p>

<p>&quot;Ancients have known this for centuries&quot; is not a very strong argument to me: they didn&#39;t know about atoms, or the speed of light, or a universe with billions of galaxies ... wouldn&#39;t it stand to reason that without any of this knowledge they couldn&#39;t even begin to imagine to understand the true nature of things.</p>

<p>How could they understand reality better than those learned people today who don&#39;t accept this theory? Are they just stuck in one way of thinking? Aren&#39;t they used to dogma&#39;s switching based on new evidence? </p>

<p>It&#39;s thought that everything in the teachings (especially from Shakyamuni Buddha and other enlightened beings) can add up to specific sums.  For example by multiplying smell, touch, taste, hearing, sight, and consciousness by if they are painful, pleasant or neutral, and then by if this is happening externally or internally, then by past, present, future we get 108 feelings (6x3x2x3=108).  108 is very significant and uses the power of 9&#39;s.  They used to have a really good site on this but it&#39;s gone.  </p>

<p>Basically, if we look at the 108, found everywhere, including beads on a Buddhist mala...  </p>

<p>this is 1+0+8=<strong>9</strong>,<br/>
then 108/2 = 54, 5+4=<strong>9</strong><br/>
54/2=27, 2+7=<strong>9</strong><br/>
27/2=13.5, 1+3+5=<strong>9</strong><br/>
13.5/2=6.75, 6+7+5=18, 1+8= <strong>9</strong><br/>
6.75/2=3.375, 3+3+7+5=18, 1+8= <strong>9</strong>  </p>

<p>It goes on for infinity.  </p>

<p>Then we can go the opposite way..   </p>

<p>108 x 2= 216 = <strong>9</strong><br/>
216 x 2= 432 = <strong>9</strong>  </p>

<p>etc.  </p>

<p>The number 9 is used everywhere too, in temple architecture, astrology, and things like that.  Anyway, that was fun :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting stuff, but numbers like that don&#39;t impress me much ... it&#39;s easy to find repeating numbers and give them deeper meanings where there aren&#39;t any and it&#39;s a human condition to do so: </p>

<p>I was born on the 13th, lived in number 13, on my 13th birthday was a friday the 13th and on that day I happened to ride a skilift, sitting on number 13 ...</p>

<p>This does not mean there was anything special about that day. (Lived in room 413, 103 and another one of 4 digits that added up to 13. These don&#39;t mean anything) </p>

<p>Whether or not there is something special about the number 9 in ancient math, the point is that their math, therefor their knowledge, is still extremely basic compared to the math we use today to understand reality. </p>

<p>It is just incredibly hard for me to imagine that a more primitive human being from the past could have a better grasp on reality then so many today who work with all of our contemporary knowledge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What we perceive in our mind is our own personal interpretation of what we see around us.</p>

<p>As we understand better what everything around us is, what it&#39;s made of, what its properties are, what &quot;laws&quot; govern how all of it interacts, we are more capable of interpreting what is around us, what&#39;s in our mind is more accurate as a result. </p>

<p>These ancients knew a fraction of this knowledge in regards to understanding the reality around us. </p>

<p>Meditation is (to me) the mind contemplating itself, momentary cutting off from the outside world and becoming as introspective as possible. </p>

<p>If the mind is already warped by a personal interpretation, how beneficial can the meditation be to accurately understanding that perceived reality better? </p>

<p>Psychedelics play on what&#39;s already in the mind, not outside of it. It has completely different effects on you, depending on your current and general state of mind. If the majority of these experiences are obviously batshit crazy hallucinations, how could you trust any of the experiences, let alone an ancient? </p>

<p>They&#39;re already severely influenced by the local religion and the current witch doctor, then go on to drastically alter their mind states their entire lives, even enforcing it with regular meditation. </p>

<p>Does quantifying reality with math not improve our understanding of it? Is this not something that should give us far greater insight into that reality than anybody living more than 100 years ago or even less, let alone any &quot;ancients&quot;?</p>

<p>By no means am I trying to claim that I&#39;m in any position to know things better than anybody else, but surely the truly intelligent people of our modern society are far more capable than anybody who came before us? </p>

<p>This thread, this subject and related subjects are far above my head, I&#39;m just enjoying the thought exercises. </p>

<p>The point isn&#39;t about whether or not the average person knows more or not, rather: considering how little ancients used to know about their reality compared to what we know now about the macro and the micro universe today, does it not make sense that people today have a better opportunity to understand our reality better than anybody in the past?</p>

I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not an interesting idea, there are a lot of interesting ideas, but just because it&#39;s interesting and superficially compelling doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s true.<br/>
The problem isn&#39;t our skepticism and disbelief, the problem is you have attached yourself to an idea, and you identify with it. Once something becomes a belief and is incorporated into your worldview, you lose all objectivity in regard to that belief.     </p>

<p>He talks about how empty space &quot;isn&#39;t really empty at all&quot; ...</p>

<p>But I feel like that&#39;s a given and not really earth shattering. We know that light comes at us from all directions, we know that light can&#39;t just appear in our corneas from across the universe, so we know it had to cross that &quot;empty space&quot; to get here, we even know how fast, and we know it was arriving a second ago, will be a second from now and can calculate about how long that light will be crossing space to reach us.</p>

<p>The universe is full of light, getting pushed by the light behind it, following the light in front of it, everywhere ... so no, &quot;empty space&quot; is obviously not empty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t really address what I said about all this empty space being saturated with light. It is quite literally everywhere ... you cannot be anywhere in our known universe without being able to look in every direction and seeing some form of light. That light, is traveling to reach you, it is traveling through the &quot;empty space&quot; that&#39;s between you and where the light&#39;s coming from. </p>

<p>If that light didn&#39;t have something to &quot;travel on&quot; then it wouldn&#39;t reach us. </p>

<p>It still feels obvious to me that all this &quot;empty space&quot; is in fact not empty at all, otherwise the idea of light reaching us seems would be impossible.  </p>

<p>Now the important thing is that this makes the proton a singularity, a black hole.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using Haramein&#39;s number for the size of a proton, which is not actually the size of a proton, would be about ten-to-the-thirty-eighth times more massive than an actual proton. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation">Using known, and observed effects of Hawking Radiation, it would radiate approximately 445 million watts of power, which is enough to power around 50,000 average US homes</a> which is more than some of our largest theoretical nuclear reactors. Because of this, fundamental facts of thermodynamics would give the proton a temperature in excess of a hundred and thirty nine billion degrees. It would vanish due to Hawking radiation in one ten billion billionth of a second. This is, if it could stand up to its <a href="http://www.eftaylor.com/grsoftware/GravWaves17July06.pdf">gravitational collapse from gravitational radiation in just under a trillionth of a trillionth of a second</a></p>

<p>One could argue that these are just theoretical parameters of the proton, and can be argued, even though they have not yet. But there does exist an actual physical and experimental proof that the proton is not a black hole. In a Schwarzschild proton, we are able to assume that there is an event horizon of 1.32fm radius, and given the definition of an event horizon nothing that crosses this horizon can re-emerge. However, in a real proton there are small-dimensional points called quarks that create a charge distribution necessary for creating the electromagnetic effects of a proton. This also follows directly from General Relativity. This messes up our proposed way out of the mass problem, because if the full mass of the black hole is experienced at short distances, then any electron or other particle used to probe inside a proton would simply vanish, making the mass black hole grow slightly. This follows from the definition of the Schwarzschild radius, which is what Haramein has used. It&#39;s a space-time horizon. Beyond this horizon, all possible measures of time are directed spatially in, and only in. Out ceases to exist, except in the past. Yet many particle experiments, in particular all those that have involved deep inelastic scattering, make it clear that we can probe inside a proton. </p>

<p>For instance, he calculates that the gravitational bond between two protons is on the order of 7.49 x 10<sup>47</sup> dynes, which is about the weight of 90 billion trillion asteroids that wiped out the dinosaurs hitting earth, or 500 quadrillion earths stacked on top of one point... Even though we can break this gravitational bond experimentally with the force of one photon impacting the proton. </p>

<p>Like this one. In QCD, the strong force gets infinitely stronger at a distance, it would take an infinite amount of energy to knock a quark out of confinement. Sounds like a black hole right?</p>

<p>This would mean that you would need 500 quadrillion trillion quadrillion...to infinity, Earths on a single point  to knock a quark out.</p>

<p>And uh, theres no causality for the strong force. It&#39;s just an X. In Nassim&#39;s, it&#39;s obviously another facet of gravitation.</p>

<p>It does not matter how &#39;large&#39; something is, only that it makes sense.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We barely understand Hawking radiation on galactic black holes, and have zero idea what it would look like at the hadron scale. </p>

To me it implies that all of this is some clumsy accident. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if what you mean by a holographic nature you mean that the universe is a reflection of something else, something more pure. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure. </p>

<p>Recently I&#39;ve been getting into Kurt gödels theorems and their quite amazing, specifically the incompleteness theorem. </p>

<p>Anyway, The universe is a reflection of the monad, or source. 
It is in the mind of the all. 
Just because this isn&#39;t really real, it doesn&#39;t mean that it is any less fake. </p>

<p>People who are homeless are still going to be homeless. Kids who have went through satanic ritual abuse are still going to suffer from that abuse. I know you weren&#39;t trying to imply that we should take anything seriously because this is all just a big elaborate holographic dream, but this shit is real. It is happening. </p>

<p>It&#39;s something I see in the new age movement a lot. How we shouldn&#39;t worry, everything is fine because, &quot;all of this isn&#39;t really real&quot;. People why say things like that are about as stupid as you can possibly be. So stupid that it&#39;s disgusting. </p>

<p>Science hasn&#39;t really discovered a lot of the things ancient philosophers spoke of thousands of years ago. I wonder why that is. 
Plato was the first to suggest the idea of the monad when he introduced the allegory of the cave.</p>

<p>The four basic forces,  for example. Our modern mainstream Scientist with their million dollar grants are slowly but surely getting around to the idea that a fifth force bounds them all, a universal glue. </p>

<p>Occultist know this as the four elements, plus the quintessence. This was discovered literally thousands of years ago. </p>

<p>Granted, the universe is a reflection of something first, but this isn&#39;t anything new, really. </p>

<p>The math may have changed but the song remains the same. </p>

<p>The universe is full of light, getting pushed by the light behind it, following the light in front of it, everywhere ... so no, &quot;empty space&quot; is obviously not empty.</p>

<p>The main difference here that is attempted to be conveyed is that space = matter in this theory. Space spinning = mass. </p>

<p>This is the proverbial aether of science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about this, you can&#39;t experience nothing because experiencing is an experience. So whilst we do die, we never cease to experience awareness, because even &quot;ceasing&quot; is a something. It&#39;s a length of time, and time does not exist in &quot;nothing&quot; because then it wouldn&#39;t be nothing. Is any of this helping? Probably not. The overall point is that awareness is immortal.</p>
