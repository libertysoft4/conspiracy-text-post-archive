<p>There are so many different kinds of ETs and ET craft that your statement can&#39;t apply across the board.  That being said, <em>some</em> ET craft are said to use a TYPE of metal-like substance that can be seen as almost organic in nature.  It&#39;s nothing like humans on Earth are familiar with.</p>

<p>As such, ETs CAN use &quot;metal craft&quot; to navigate...it&#39;s just not any type of metal we know here.</p>

<p>Most UFOs may very well be of human origin.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not talking about or dealing with &quot;most&quot; UFOs, however.  I&#39;m referring to those that AREN&#39;T of human origin - and, regardless of how many <em>are</em> of human origin, there are definitely at least SOME that are most definitely <em>not</em> of human origin.</p>

<p>As Stanton Friedman is wont to say, &quot;There are many UFO sightings which end up being terrestrially explained.  This is about as useful as saying most isotopes aren’t fissionable or most people aren’t 7′ tall.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough.  Not taking it personally.  However, why refer to this example in such universal, unqualified terms?  All it takes is ONE bonafide example of a real ET craft, and literally every one of the thousands of hoaxed cases become moot.</p>

<p>And, again, there have been a <em>lot</em> more than just &quot;one&quot; bonafide example.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the only way I could see a craft like the one that crashed at Roswell being ET is if the ET&#39;s originated from within our own solar system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the fact that multiple military, industrial, and civilian personnel over the decades with credentials <em>greatly</em> outstripping any average pleb have come forward attesting to the veracity of <em>actual beings found in the crafts</em> just gets...conveniently ignored?  Wut?</p>

<p>And Rosswell Shmosswell for that matter.  Rosswell is but one example of a case.  There are MAAAANY cases and investigators with <em>great</em> credentials that have done very valid work showing the reality of ET existence in and around this planet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems impossible that a craft with the capabilities of that one could&#39;ve come from a different solar system or galaxy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really?  Why?  First of all, we don&#39;t actually, fully KNOW &quot;the capabilities&quot; of that craft.  Second of all, why would it seem &quot;impossible&quot; that it could have come from a different solar system or galaxy?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>not to mention the absurdity of an ET race being advanced enough to get to Earth and then crash landing like amateurs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a pretty bad straw man fallacy here, as we don&#39;t know the circumstances under which the ship crashed.  We don&#39;t know what kind of technology the military industrial community has.  We don&#39;t know what is hidden within the black project levels of development on this planet.  Additionally, there have been various reports about the electromagnetic disturbances caused by the power lines, etc in the area where the ship crashed.</p>

<p>My point here is that it simply shouldn&#39;t be assumed that there was no way the ship could have crashed on its own.</p>

<p>Either way, and again, I&#39;m not even super concerned with the Rosswell incident alone here, because even if Rosswell WAS/is a fake/hoax (which I don&#39;t think it is), it still doesn&#39;t do away with the investigation of all the other many, <em>maaaaany</em> cases that have taken place throughout recent history.  If only ONE of those cases is valid, then it just does entirely away with any argument about ETs &quot;never having visited here&quot;.</p>

<p>Maybe.  Do you have an example of one that you would say is indisputably <em>not</em> human in origin so I can investigate further?  You&#39;ve probably done more research into this subject than me to be sure but I&#39;ve never seen one that I could definitely say with absolute certainty, &quot;That <em>is</em> an ET craft.&quot;  The best I&#39;ve seen are ones where I&#39;ve been able to say, &quot;That <em>may</em> be an ET craft.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t discount the possibility though, let me make that clear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, why refer to this example in such universal, unqualified terms?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few reasons.  For one, that&#39;s probably the most &quot;famous&quot; and widely known example of a confirmed UFO.  It also is the one most closely associated with the MJ-12 documents in which they all but outright state that the craft is ET in origin.</p>

<p>If you actually look at the evidence presented in the documents, however, this doesn&#39;t really seem to be supported.  So I think it&#39;s highly significant if it could be confirmed that these documents purporting ET origin are a hoax - it would throw the entire subject into question.</p>

<p>The other side of this is that perhaps putting out disinformation like this deliberately keeps people (such as myself) off of the trail of legitimate ET presence.  So I can definitely see both angles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the fact that multiple military, industrial, and civilian personnel over the decades with credentials greatly outstripping any average pleb have come forward attesting to the veracity of actual beings found in the crafts just gets...conveniently ignored?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not ignored, no, just weighted against the evidence and other things I&#39;ve come across over the years.  There is almost no extent to which these people won&#39;t go to to disinform and deceive the public.  We&#39;ve read about Bluebeam, we&#39;ve heard Von Braun&#39;s and others&#39; comments about a fake alien invasion, it isn&#39;t like the entire thing is unheard of.</p>

<p>And <em>if</em> it&#39;s true that something like this is planned, then it stands to reason that seeds would have to be planted in the minds of the masses beforehand about the possibility of ET&#39;s.  Maybe shills are hired or assigned to deliberately lie about things they&#39;ve seen or done, maybe they&#39;re fooled into believing what they&#39;re saying somehow.  William Cooper is an example of this as he later in life came to believe he&#39;d been misled about ET&#39;s.</p>

<p>This is just speculation but I hope it will shed some light on where I&#39;m coming from.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Really? Why? First of all, we don&#39;t actually, fully KNOW &quot;the capabilities&quot; of that craft. Second of all, why would it seem &quot;impossible&quot; that it could have come from a different solar system or galaxy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on the MJ-12 documents.  The craft are described as reaching speeds &quot;up to&quot; 1200 mph.  It would take an absurdly long amount of time to reach Earth from somewhere outside of our solar system at these speeds.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the apparent uncertainty in the White Hot Intelligence document about whether the craft was ET or not.  In other words, what I&#39;m saying here is that I think it&#39;s <em>likely</em> that we would know an ET craft if we saw one.  Any craft advanced enough to reach here from the next galaxy would probably look far different from anything we&#39;ve seen before.  And this directly contradicts with the supposed ET body discovered in the craft - you&#39;d think that would have made it obvious that the craft was ET, so why the uncertainty?  Just seems odd to me.</p>

<p>Later on, the documents claim &quot;interstellar space travel is possible&quot; - but based on what?  A craft that flies at 1200 mph?</p>

<p>They also mention a &quot;series of coils and heavy magnets&quot;, the description of which sounds a lot like the Schappeller device developed by Nazi Germany.</p>

<p>The documents also mention a &quot;leaf book&quot; discovered in the craft.  Why would an advanced alien race from another galaxy have need to scribble notes in a leaf book?  That doesn&#39;t jive with me.</p>

<p>These are just some of the things with that case and with those documents that seem suspect, there are a few more too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a pretty bad straw man fallacy here, as we don&#39;t know the circumstances under which the ship crashed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know.  I&#39;m giving my opinion.  It <em>seems</em> absurd to me that an ET race could conquer interstellar travel at or near the speed of light and then crash land to Earth.</p>

<p>I think I hold the exact opposite viewpoint as you which is that if even one of the ET sightings is a hoax then it throws all of the others into question as well.</p>

<p>I also think we should be more concerned with the humans who have access to this technology (if there are humans who do).</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Do you have an example of one that you would say is indisputably not human in origin so I can investigate further?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Na.  Not really.  I mean, there&#39;s are the discussions Steven Greer had a few years ago with the panel of military and civilian professionals.  That alone should have been enough to let any real critical thinker understand that we are likely NOT alone on this very planet (to say nothing about the cosmos).  There are the hundreds of cases that Pulitzer Prize-winning, Harvard-educated, professor of psychiatry <em>at</em> Harvard Dr. John Mack studied (a great authority on the subject of ET contact who, incidentally, died under <em>very</em> mysterious circumstances).  Also very difficult to simply discount his studies off hand if at all.</p>

<p>Independent of all this, however, I&#39;ve had various personal experiences that let me know that we are very likely <em>not</em> alone on this planet in the least.  For this reason, I don&#39;t document all that much the information I come across - even when it&#39;s good and solid information - since I pretty much already know that ETs exist on this planet from personal experience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve never seen one that I could definitely say with absolute certainty, &quot;That is an ET craft.&quot; The best I&#39;ve seen are ones where I&#39;ve been able to say, &quot;That may be an ET craft.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a reason why most people haven&#39;t had a DIRECT experience of ET existence.  It&#39;s because there simply <em>is</em> indeed a very powerful and concerted effort to keep the reality of the phenomena from being understood by the vast majority of the population on Earth.  The best most people can do is say &quot;That <em>may</em> be an ET craft.&quot;</p>

<p>That being said, if you come across ENOUGH occasions and examples and studies where you say &quot;That <em>may</em> be an ET craft.&quot;, then the law of averages will tell you that at least ONE of those &quot;maybes&quot; likely is an actual &quot;IS&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t discount the possibility though, let me make that clear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alright.  Cool.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Still though.  Again, even if Roswell is 100% fake (which I don&#39;t think it is), then there are dozens of other cases which <em>aren&#39;t</em> fake...so &quot;meh&quot; on Roswell.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The other side of this is that perhaps putting out disinformation like this deliberately keeps people (such as myself) off of the trail of legitimate ET presence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep.  Most definitely.  Most people will just go &quot;Aw that was a bullshit example.&quot; and just throw it <em>all</em> aside as malarky.  Not a very good reaction, but it&#39;s what TPTB bank on happening with most...and that&#39;s what most people do, unfortunately.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not ignored, no, just weighted against the evidence and other things I&#39;ve come across over the years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But if you REALLY weigh it all against the REAL evidence, then you&#39;ll find that there is actually MORE evidence supporting the reality of ET existence on and about this planet than not.  Heck, just look at any one of the docs on Stanton Friedman.  He presents this argument decently well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is almost no extent to which these people won&#39;t go to to disinform and deceive the public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly.  It&#39;s a constant, non stop barrage of disinformation on the public.  And why?  Because the reality of ET existence is pretty damn overwhelming...so TPTB that wish to keep the public clueless about the subject have to work HEAVILY overtime to keep us ignorant.</p>

<p>So far, unfortunately, they have done a good job on most.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Based on the MJ-12 documents. The craft are described as reaching speeds &quot;up to&quot; 1200 mph. It would take an absurdly long amount of time to reach Earth from somewhere outside of our solar system at these speeds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That the craft was clocked at those speeds in no way indicates that this was it&#39;s <em>top</em> speed.  It indicates merely that this was the speed it was clocked at.  There is NO civilian aircraft that has ever flown at top speeds while equipped with passengers, let alone when it&#39;s below cruising altitude.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think it&#39;s <em>likely</em> that we would know an ET craft if we saw one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But why would you think it likely?  Especially if you think we might have never even seen a bonafide one in the first place?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any craft advanced enough to reach here from the next galaxy would probably look far different from anything we&#39;ve seen before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a very valid assessment though.  The majority of the UFOs sighted are indeed flat ovals - and this is no recent phenomena.  This has been the case from as far back as ancient and biblical times.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>this directly contradicts with the supposed ET body discovered in the craft</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, once one realizes that it&#39;s not that far-fetched that an ET craft can indeed be oval shaped, it&#39;s also not all THAT far fetched that the ET form can indeed take on a humanoid, bipedal shape as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They also mention a &quot;series of coils and heavy magnets&quot;, the description of which sounds a lot like the Schappeller device developed by Nazi Germany.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Germany was said to have attempted a lot of back engineering in this area.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These are just some of the things with that case and with those documents that seem suspect, there are a few more too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m certain there is, again, a lot of disinformation and misinformation that has been inserted into the Rosswell case to shake investigators off the track.  Lots of confusion to be sure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think I hold the exact opposite viewpoint as you which is that if even one of the ET sightings is a hoax then it throws all of the others into question as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But wait a minute...Why do that?  The actual fact of the matter is that if only ONE is real (and, again, a lot more than one are real) then it doesn&#39;t matter if 99% of the rest of them <em>are</em> indeed hoaxes.  What people are trying to find out here is if 1) ETs exist, and 2) if they&#39;ve visited Earth.</p>

<p>All that&#39;s needed is ONE example of that having taken place to settle the matter - and it doesn&#39;t matter if a million fakes came before and after it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just simple logic right there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I also think we should be more concerned with the humans who have access to this technology (if there are humans who do).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are indeed humans that do, and I think we SHOULD be very concerned about that - as those humans have a power over the majority that I&#39;m not sure should in fact be had.</p>

<p>Still though. Again, even if Roswell is 100% fake (which I don&#39;t think it is), then there are dozens of other cases which aren&#39;t fake...so &quot;meh&quot; on Roswell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe, like I said I would need to look at one of these more in depth.  For the ones I have (Roswell, Kecksburgh, and a couple others) there are in my mind <em>significant</em> problems with the evidence that make me suspect terrestrial origin.  But, admittedly, there is a lot more out there on this subject that I haven&#39;t delved into and, at the same time, I <em>have</em> delved somewhat deeply into human black ops and suppressed technology which perhaps biases me in the direction of terrestrial UFO origin.</p>

<p>Let me sum it up this way: if tomorrow it were claimed that ET&#39;s were attacking our planet, I would be far more inclined to suspect that humans were the ones behind it until it was proven otherwise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But why would you think it likely? Especially if you think we might have never even seen a bonafide one in the first place?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would reverse the question: why <em>is</em> it likely that an ET craft from a distant galaxy, which travels at/near/above the speed of light, would look like something a human made?  I don&#39;t know, this is just my opinion but I would think it would be obvious that, &quot;Hey, this didn&#39;t come from Earth.&quot;  Maybe not though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Germany was said to have attempted a lot of back engineering in this area.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They definitely had some crazy tech - whether they back-engineered it or developed it off of the backs of Tesla and others can of course be argued (as can where Tesla himself got these ideas and technology from).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The actual fact of the matter is that if only ONE is real (and, again, a lot more than one are real) then it doesn&#39;t matter if 99% of the rest of them are indeed hoaxes. What people are trying to find out here is if 1) ETs exist, and 2) if they&#39;ve visited Earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People are trying to find out what UFO&#39;s are.  If it were determined that most or all UFO&#39;s are human in origin and that the elite of this planet are hoarding incredibly advanced technology for themselves and using it to not only increase their control but also to fake the existence of ETs in order to fake an alien invasion in the future and bring about one world government... then that&#39;s pretty significant.</p>

<p>This is what I mean.  I think humans such as this, who would go to these incredible extents to deceive and control the rest of us, would hypothetically be the biggest threat the rest of us face.</p>

<p>All in all, I don&#39;t disagree with you or what you&#39;re saying necessarily (and, in fact, I think it&#39;s highly possible), I just don&#39;t share your certainty about the presence of ET&#39;s on this planet.  At least not in the physical sense - I think there may be something to the idea that certain ET&#39;s/UFO&#39;s are actually interdimensional in nature which would explain how some are able to seemingly appear and disappear at will, almost like they can choose to manifest in 3-D or not.</p>

<p>Interesting stuff to consider though regardless.</p>

<p>Oh most definitely.</p>

<p>I think you meant to say &quot;Hey, this <del>didn&#39;t</del> DID come from Earth.&quot; (i.e. &quot;This craft is NOT ET in origin.&quot;) right?</p>

<p>That being said, this seems to me to be a mistake in assessment - assuming that a craft is human-made because it&#39;s a spherical/oval metalloid object.  There isn&#39;t very sound reasoning in supposing that terrestrial human beings somehow have a monopoly on the oval/spherical shape that many of the ET craft that have visited this planet often (but most definitely not always) take.</p>

<p>Some definitely are.</p>

<p>Others are trying to find out more than just that.  Some are trying to get a handle on ETs themselves as well - not just their crafts.</p>

<p>Okay...One, TPTB <em>are</em> likely trying to do that very thing.</p>

<p>I would not disagree with this in the least.</p>

<p>One, I&#39;m not so supers sure that the beings that have <em>this</em> level of global control and power are strictly human.</p>

<p>Two, as much as I agree with what you&#39;re saying - that these beings (human or not) are a big threat to humanity - it seems actually to be a separate issue from attempting to assess whether or not ETs are visiting this planet.  I would say they definitely are, and there is, as you hypothesized, a <em>very</em> powerful consortium on this planet making sure and keeping this information under wraps.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not convinced that there isn&#39;t a LOT of validity in a good portion of the information found <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14utv0/911_was_an_occult_megaritual_the_numbers_of_the_4/c7gwqaz"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Fair enough - I guess my concern is more with preventing or being ready for a Bluebeam-type psy-op than it is with whether true ET&#39;s have visited or are visiting (or have been here all along).

<p>No I meant that the assumption I&#39;m making, which seems logical enough to me (maybe it isn&#39;t), is that a true ET craft, something from a distant galaxy that utilizes worm-hole technology and/or travels at the speed of light etc. - I would assume that it would appear pretty insane-looking to the naked eye if we were to see one close up.  I&#39;d have expected the guys who investigated the crash at Roswell, if it were one of those craft, to know immediately (or shortly thereafter) that it was not something that came from Earth.  The fact that they expressed doubt (even with having supposedly found an ET body onboard) and even after studying the craft itself... it just seems odd to me.</p>

<p>And then the way they described the technology sounding at least a little bit like other things that we know (or at least highly suspect) humans were capable of making around the same time?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Okay, say I accept that as being true.  Then what?  That wouldn&#39;t make a fake ET attack any more dangerous to the rest of us and I think <em>that&#39;s</em> the more pressing concern.</p>

<p>I guess what I&#39;m saying is this: suppose there are two classes of UFO&#39;s.  One man-made, one ET.  I think we should be more concerned with the man-made aspect of it, the ways the technology and the idea can and have been used against us, and to ensure that we would all be mentally prepared <em>if</em> something like that were to actually occur (and let&#39;s hope it never does).</p>

<p>Or are you saying that you think the ETs (or some of them) are sort of &quot;looking out for us&quot;?  I&#39;ve heard things like this in the past, like how they&#39;ve been documented consistently around nuclear and advanced weapon test sights and have caused equipment to fail, etc.  It would be nice if that were true for sure.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a fair concern, as one cannot count TPTB out of doing something nefarious involving ETs, etc.  I made two OPs relating to this very topic a while back (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/qx0ad/the_governments_fear_of_mass_panic_excuse_has/"><strong>1</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/vlsjp/wtf_an_alien_invasion_ff_becoming_more_and_more/"><strong>2</strong></a>).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely.  Fully agreed.  I hope you see how much I very much DO agree with that by the two different OPs on this subject I linked above.</p>

<p>This is a bit different than the topic we&#39;re dealing with here, however, and one shouldn&#39;t allow themselves to reject actual and real ET contacts because some of them might be/are manipulative ploys by TPTB.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a true ET craft, something from a distant galaxy that utilizes worm-hole technology and/or travels at the speed of light etc. - I would assume that it would appear pretty insane-looking to the naked eye if we were to see one close up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some ET craft just look like balls of light to the naked eye...and that&#39;s almost all some ET craft actually <em>are</em>...on the outside anyway.</p>

<p>Some ETs are likely so vastly different and dissimilar to us humans that you are right in thinking that we would scarcely even be able to recognize them as even <em>beings</em> in the first place.  This universe is <em>biiig</em> - much more vast than we can imagine, I&#39;m sure - and I wouldn&#39;t in the least doubt that there are beings that are far beyond anything our puny minds can imagine.</p>

<p>Some, however, have been said to be/are <em>very</em> similar in appearance to us.  Some are said to be almost indistinguishable from terrestrial human beings.</p>

<p>I imagine many craft are as &quot;out there&quot; as out there can get.  Many take the elliptical, saucer shape that is often depicted, however.</p>

<p>The other thing you have to keep in mind in all of this though is that the ET saucer shape has been depicted from as far back as we have recorded history.  This is a <em>very</em> important point here as it pertains to what we&#39;re talking about and your thinking that they might be TPTB ploys.  Some of them today likely <em>are</em> PTB ploys.  However, what can possibly be said for ET saucer shaped craft depicted in books and cuneiform tablets that are <em>thousands</em> of years old?  Were they government and PTB ploys too?  I think it stretches the limits of credulity to allege that, because some flying disk shaped objects were depicted before history even records there ever <em>being</em> a government (the way we recognize &quot;big government&quot; today, anyway) in the first place - much less a &quot;PTB&quot; secretly ruling over that government.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d have expected the guys who investigated the crash at Roswell, if it were one of those craft, to know immediately (or shortly thereafter) that it was not something that came from Earth.</p>

<p>And I believe it&#39;s said that this is exactly what happened.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact that they expressed doubt (even with having supposedly found an ET body onboard) and even after studying the craft itself... it just seems odd to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If your mind is stuck on one particular perspective or point of view only, and you are met with something that blows that perspective to smithereens, you might not quite acknowledge or be immediately willing to accept the truth of that paradigm-shattering truth either.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And then the way they described the technology sounding at least a little bit like other things that we know (or at least highly suspect) humans were capable of making around the same time?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Generally speaking, however, there&#39;s no other point of reference any human being has other than the times they&#39;re living in.  They can only describe things by referencing what they themselves know.  That&#39;s why the description of many ET craft during biblical times were described as &quot;fiery chariots in the air&quot;.  Again, you can only use the references of the time you live in to describe things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>say I accept that as being true. Then what? That wouldn&#39;t make a fake ET attack any more dangerous to the rest of us and I think that&#39;s the more pressing concern.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t make it any more dangerous, but it might cause many to NOT lose their damn heads as much or as quickly as they would if they knew or understood that it&#39;s NOT an ET attack that&#39;s occurring, but another b.s. false flag attack by TPTB right here on Earth.</p>

<p>Understand that ff attacks are meant to cause the citizenry to - in absolute and abject fear - bow down to whatever &quot;solution&quot; TPTB make in order to &quot;save the day!&quot;.</p>

<p>If the people have a better understanding about the truth of ET existence, then with that knowledge and understanding will come a dispelling of the fears that the MSM and the movies constantly drum up in the public.  Once that happens, then the public will be able to see a LOT more easily through any type of &quot;ET invasion&quot; ff ploy that TPTB might try.</p>

<p>Understanding the truth about the existence of ETs makes it LESS likely that any ff attack by TPTB will succeed - not less likely.</p>

<p>[Imagine, incidentally, how things would have gone if we could magically go back and we all knew BEFORE the 911 attacks everything that we know now.  Imagine how LITTLE effect those attacks - horrible and traumatic as they most definitely were - would have on the public.  Imagine what would have happened.  The people wouldn&#39;t have freaked out as horribly.  They (we) would have likely waged an immediate and all out assault - a straight up civil war revolution - right here in America on congress here, realizing that we were being attacked by our very own government.  Instead, because we were blind sided, and ended up bowing down like scared pigs to whatever TPTB said should be done in response.]</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Agreed - since, unfortunately, it seems the terrestrially-constructed ones are more likely to be nefarious than the REAL extraterrestrial crafts.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree that we should be very well prepared for the possibility of that type of chicanery.  However, denying the existence of ETs on and around this planet doesn&#39;t seem to help that preparation.  It seems that it indeed <em>hinders</em> that preparation on the population&#39;s part because it keeps people generally ignorant of the existence of ETs in general and, hence, the people will be all the more ignorant of what&#39;s actually going on if a FF &quot;ET attack&quot; were to actually take place by TPTB against the people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or are you saying that you think the ETs (or some of them) are sort of &quot;looking out for us&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of them are, some of them aren&#39;t.  Some of them are cool.  Some of them don&#39;t give a fuck about us.  Some of them are indifferent to us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve heard things like this in the past, like how they&#39;ve been documented consistently around nuclear and advanced weapon test sights and have caused equipment to fail, etc. It would be nice if that were true for sure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, we shouldn&#39;t confuse ET action of this type as an illustration of their &quot;caring&quot; for us.  I would say that&#39;s an indication of ETs caring for the REAL treasure here - Mother Earth herself; Gaia.  Some ETs may very well be like &quot;Hey.  Ya&#39;ll stupid human motherfuckers can do all ya&#39;ll want to each other.  We don&#39;t give a fuck about that.  But if you start up with this stupid nuclear technology bullshit, you might hurt Mother Earth herself, and THAT we cannot allow.  It&#39;s not about you little stupid human ants.  It&#39;s about saving the Mother.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is, but I read that and just think, &quot;That could so easily be disinfo.&quot;</p>

<p>For instance, we <em>know</em> that Harry Truman was a shill for the globalists/PTB - why are we trusting him here when he states with certainty that UFO&#39;s are ET?  If the man is a proven liar and stooge, everything he says becomes suspect.</p>

<p>Same with the NASA and Apollo guys.  I don&#39;t know your feelings on the subject, but I&#39;m wholly convinced that, if we <em>did</em> make it to the Moon, we didn&#39;t do it the way NASA told us we did.  So why am I now trusting NASA astronauts and engineers and whoever else when I&#39;ve already accepted that most of them lied completely about the Apollo missions?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s interesting that a lot of the people in that graphic who claim ET origin are the people I&#39;m talking about - seemingly a lot of the &quot;higher ups&quot;.  And then the lower level people almost unanimously state that &quot;The UFO phenomenon is real&quot; but they don&#39;t necessarily speak to an ET origin or not, just to the existence of the orbs or crafts themselves.</p>

<p>From THAT many people though?  <em>All</em> of it disinfo?  Seems retty unlikely to me.  The law of averages states that at least a few statements of this level of certainty from a group of individuals of <em>this</em> status in the community would very likely have at <em>least</em> some sort of significant validity.</p>

<p>100 &quot;shmos&quot; saying &quot;We heard cigarettes&#39;ll kill ya&quot; doesn&#39;t mean that much.</p>

<p>100 cardiac surgeons saying &quot;We heard cigarettes&#39;ll kill ya&quot; means <em>a lot</em>.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>While that&#39;s not a bad point, I don&#39;t think a very clean parallel can be drawn in applying one level of chicanery entirely across the board across all aspects of an individual&#39;s statements.  Martin Luther King Jr. was said to have been adulterous.  Gandhi was said to have been physically abusive to his spouse.  If one were to apply the shortcomings these individuals had in one area to the entirety of their character across the board, one would be almost entirely mistaken with regard to their true valor, honor, and worth.</p>

<p>Not saying Truman had any level of valor similar to Gandhi or MLK, but I think the point I&#39;m making here still stands and applies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the man is a proven liar and stooge, everything he says becomes suspect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is quite a bit too general, as it can be said that literally EVERY HUMAN BEING ON PLANET EARTH <em>EVER</em> has at one point or another in their lives been a liar and a stooge.  There are definitely mitigating circumstances that should certainly be considered when assessing how a person&#39;s character weighs in relation to any type of ET disclosure they may divulge.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That sounds about right to me as well.  I feel strongly that a big part of the reason why we either never went to the moon in the first place, or haven&#39;t been back in many decades, however, is because we were <em>warded off</em> by those already there.</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;m actually not so convinced myself after watching it, it strongly suggested there was more going on.  I&#39;ll need to look more into it all in the near future.</p>

<p>Heck, the issue with ANY sensitive subject on this planet is what you just correctly mentioned here.  Disinformation and misinformation agents run amok.  One has to be very discerning and very dynamic with their critical thinking in order to sift the wheat from the chaff and in properly navigating the very polluted waters of sensitive information.</p>

<p>What are you asking here? For a good UFO sighting or an explanation? Personally, I believe the UFOs are anti-gravity technology that the military is already using and aliens is a disinformation cover story.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Do you have an example of one that you would say is indisputably not human in origin so I can investigate further?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Na.  Not really.  I mean, there&#39;s are the discussions Steven Greer had a few years ago with the panel of military and civilian professionals.  That alone should have been enough to let any real critical thinker understand that we are likely NOT alone on this very planet (to say nothing about the cosmos).  There are the hundreds of cases that Pulitzer Prize-winning, Harvard-educated, professor of psychiatry <em>at</em> Harvard Dr. John Mack studied (a great authority on the subject of ET contact who, incidentally, died under <em>very</em> mysterious circumstances).  Also very difficult to simply discount his studies off hand if at all.</p>

<p>Independent of all this, however, I&#39;ve had various personal experiences that let me know that we are very likely <em>not</em> alone on this planet in the least.  For this reason, I don&#39;t document all that much the information I come across - even when it&#39;s good and solid information - since I pretty much already know that ETs exist on this planet from personal experience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve never seen one that I could definitely say with absolute certainty, &quot;That is an ET craft.&quot; The best I&#39;ve seen are ones where I&#39;ve been able to say, &quot;That may be an ET craft.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a reason why most people haven&#39;t had a DIRECT experience of ET existence.  It&#39;s because there simply <em>is</em> indeed a very powerful and concerted effort to keep the reality of the phenomena from being understood by the vast majority of the population on Earth.  The best most people can do is say &quot;That <em>may</em> be an ET craft.&quot;</p>

<p>That being said, if you come across ENOUGH occasions and examples and studies where you say &quot;That <em>may</em> be an ET craft.&quot;, then the law of averages will tell you that at least ONE of those &quot;maybes&quot; likely is an actual &quot;IS&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t discount the possibility though, let me make that clear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alright.  Cool.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>However, why refer to this example in such universal, unqualified terms?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few reasons. For one, that&#39;s probably the most &quot;famous&quot; and widely known example of a confirmed UFO. It also is the one most closely associated with the MJ-12 documents in which they all but outright state that the craft is ET in origin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Still though.  Again, even if Roswell is 100% fake (which I don&#39;t think it is), then there are dozens of other cases which <em>aren&#39;t</em> fake...so &quot;meh&quot; on Roswell.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The other side of this is that perhaps putting out disinformation like this deliberately keeps people (such as myself) off of the trail of legitimate ET presence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep.  Most definitely.  Most people will just go &quot;Aw that was a bullshit example.&quot; and just throw it <em>all</em> aside as malarky.  Not a very good reaction, but it&#39;s what TPTB bank on happening with most...and that&#39;s what most people do, unfortunately.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not ignored, no, just weighted against the evidence and other things I&#39;ve come across over the years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But if you REALLY weigh it all against the REAL evidence, then you&#39;ll find that there is actually MORE evidence supporting the reality of ET existence on and about this planet than not.  Heck, just look at any one of the docs on Stanton Friedman.  He presents this argument decently well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is almost no extent to which these people won&#39;t go to to disinform and deceive the public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly.  It&#39;s a constant, non stop barrage of disinformation on the public.  And why?  Because the reality of ET existence is pretty damn overwhelming...so TPTB that wish to keep the public clueless about the subject have to work HEAVILY overtime to keep us ignorant.</p>

<p>So far, unfortunately, they have done a good job on most.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Based on the MJ-12 documents. The craft are described as reaching speeds &quot;up to&quot; 1200 mph. It would take an absurdly long amount of time to reach Earth from somewhere outside of our solar system at these speeds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That the craft was clocked at those speeds in no way indicates that this was it&#39;s <em>top</em> speed.  It indicates merely that this was the speed it was clocked at.  There is NO civilian aircraft that has ever flown at top speeds while equipped with passengers, let alone when it&#39;s below cruising altitude.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think it&#39;s <em>likely</em> that we would know an ET craft if we saw one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But why would you think it likely?  Especially if you think we might have never even seen a bonafide one in the first place?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any craft advanced enough to reach here from the next galaxy would probably look far different from anything we&#39;ve seen before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a very valid assessment though.  The majority of the UFOs sighted are indeed flat ovals - and this is no recent phenomena.  This has been the case from as far back as ancient and biblical times.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>this directly contradicts with the supposed ET body discovered in the craft</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, once one realizes that it&#39;s not that far-fetched that an ET craft can indeed be oval shaped, it&#39;s also not all THAT far fetched that the ET form can indeed take on a humanoid, bipedal shape as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They also mention a &quot;series of coils and heavy magnets&quot;, the description of which sounds a lot like the Schappeller device developed by Nazi Germany.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Germany was said to have attempted a lot of back engineering in this area.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These are just some of the things with that case and with those documents that seem suspect, there are a few more too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m certain there is, again, a lot of disinformation and misinformation that has been inserted into the Rosswell case to shake investigators off the track.  Lots of confusion to be sure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think I hold the exact opposite viewpoint as you which is that if even one of the ET sightings is a hoax then it throws all of the others into question as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But wait a minute...Why do that?  The actual fact of the matter is that if only ONE is real (and, again, a lot more than one are real) then it doesn&#39;t matter if 99% of the rest of them <em>are</em> indeed hoaxes.  What people are trying to find out here is if 1) ETs exist, and 2) if they&#39;ve visited Earth.</p>

<p>All that&#39;s needed is ONE example of that having taken place to settle the matter - and it doesn&#39;t matter if a million fakes came before and after it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just simple logic right there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I also think we should be more concerned with the humans who have access to this technology (if there are humans who do).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are indeed humans that do, and I think we SHOULD be very concerned about that - as those humans have a power over the majority that I&#39;m not sure should in fact be had.</p>
