    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s very interesting, but I find that most people who &quot;know a lot about sports&quot; also fall into a category of mainstream propaganda. </p>

<p>I can only speak for people in my area, but relating to Chomsky&#39;s anecdote about callers on a sports talk radio network....it&#39;s all BS. Most callers are just parroting the same stats they&#39;ve seen on ESPN or any major sports network. They are just spouting the same trite nonsense that has become the &quot;sports talk show&quot; wherein caricature talking heads &quot;disagree&quot; with each other in fake debate. The truth is, they actually know very, very little about <em>playing</em> the sport, especially at the highest level. In fact, most of them have never played the sports they hold so dearly.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually <em>exactly</em> like world affairs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t that essentially the point? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, no, I think Chomsky&#39;s point was: people are willing to <em>feel</em> like they believe in having their &quot;own opinion&quot; on certain aspects of sports. Like questioning a coach&#39;s decisions, or questioning a player&#39;s abilities. </p>

<p>However, he doesn&#39;t account for how many people <em>also</em> question their political leader&#39;s decisions, or question their abilities. Ever actually listened to Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck? Coast to Coast? Alex Jones? </p>

<p>While some of those don&#39;t fit into &quot;mainstream&quot; the fact is, people still are programmed by others telling them their opinions. People internalize that knowledge that is spoken to them (propaganda) and make it their own opinion. Then they call in to blab about it. It doesn&#39;t change the fact that they aren&#39;t thinking for themselves, be it about sports, world affairs, gardening, music, whatever the fuck people are &quot;blabbing&quot; about. </p>

<p>IMO, it&#39;s not that people know too much about sports, and not enough about world affairs, it&#39;s that people believe what they are told, no matter what the topic. </p>

<p>Edit: Re-read your posts, and I agree. I misunderstood. Leaving this post, regardless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>pretty interesting, but for me, it&#39;s not that I want to live in a fantasy world as much as it is that I can&#39;t ever tell who is telling the truth and who is blowing smoke up my ass.  That is why I don&#39;t know a whole lot about international affairs, it&#39;s just too damn hard to tell who&#39;s giving you real info.  But some of it also does stem from the fact that I don&#39;t feel like I can impact much.  The only way IMO to make a difference in the world is to obtain a ton of power and wealth.

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s why we feel a revolution is close: the government is getting arrogant. They are slipping up- showing their hand.

    <div class="md"><p>i can understand how one would feel that way, it might be possible,</p>

<p>the fact that domestic abuse is not new &amp; happens everyday- everywhere, and is made known, even moreso because of social media, any &quot;celeb&quot; is gonna be &quot;blasted&quot;, i don&#39;t think that because someone makes &quot;X &quot;amount of money they should get a&quot;get out of jai free card&quot; because the man is a sports professional,</p>

<p>abuse probably does occur more often with women of color with a household income way less that what these guys make, imo it doesn&#39;t make it less horrible because of her skin color, (which is not to say that it doesn&#39;t happen with white people, it does) when this happens (to anyone, every one <em>should be</em> speaking out), is it because ppl have become desensitized to violence? does it matter if liquor or drugs were involved? is it relevant that his <em>job</em> is to knock down another man?</p>

<p>the bottom line is that domestic abuse should not be accepted - at all - 
i wonder if the reason the laws aren&#39;t tougher is because white males are at the top of the food chain? </p>

<p>NFL dominating the news isn&#39;t going delay war.</p>

<p>edit: sp</p>

<p>also: i wonder it makes a difference if a person <em>has been</em> abused by a SO (verbal abuse, pushed, slapped, hit, beaten) as opposed to someone who has never been in toxic relationship, to understand why this is getting so much notice. </p>

So therefore anything you do that I don&#39;t find enjoyable would be wasteful as a hobby.  To me, smoking pot as a habit is wasteful.  I smoke it for pain relief.

<p>Considering his status, yes its a pretty huge deal. </p>

<p>Is war more important? Yes.  But its not like thats gonna be on the news.  Obama says its not war, they parrot it, and in the end no one knows its escalating quickly any way.  Sports news isn&#39;t taking the place of real news.  That would imply we would get real news. </p>

<p>You know the violence that occurs over illegal drug trade, not saying you partake in it or that it should be illegal in the first place. Bitcoins were traded for <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5927379/the-secret-online-weapons-store-thatll-sell-anyone-anything">weapons/drugs</a> not too long ago. As you know bitcoins can be purchased with another currency, so not very hard to obtain. Not saying bitcoins are bad though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“The world is like a ride in an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it you think it&#39;s real because that&#39;s how powerful our minds are. The ride goes up and down, around and around, it has thrills and chills, and it&#39;s very brightly colored, and it&#39;s very loud, and it&#39;s fun for a while.</p>

<p>Many people have been on the ride a long time, and they begin to wonder, &quot;Hey, is this real, or is this just a ride?&quot; And other people have remembered, and they come back to us and say, &quot;Hey, don&#39;t worry; don&#39;t be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride.&quot; And we … kill those people. &quot;Shut him up! I&#39;ve got a lot invested in this ride, shut him up! </p>

<p><em>Look at my furrows of worry, look at my big bank account, and my family. This has to be real.&quot;</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s just a ride. But we always kill the good guys who try and tell us that, you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok … But it doesn&#39;t matter, because it&#39;s just a ride. And we can change it any time we want. It&#39;s only a choice.</p>

<p>No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money. Just a simple choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love instead see all of us as one. Here&#39;s what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride. </p>

<p>Take all that money we spend on weapons and defenses each year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would pay for many times over, not one human being excluded, and we could explore space, together, both inner and outer, forever, in peace.”
― Bill Hicks</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That itself sounds like a better reality. I&#39;m tired of being chained down, mentally and socially. We are just slaves.. that&#39;s it. I want to live in a world where I can make a difference. This world is brainwashed into overcoming authority, why is there always a need to overcome authority? Oppression? This world is a broken record with leaders turning into tyrants, over, and over, and over again. I&#39;m tired of that. I just wanna explore and make a difference as in a discovery, or to simply have the freedom to be where I want to be, do what I want to do without anyone telling me I can&#39;t.</p>

<p>That will never be possible in this world. They cheated and drugged us into stupidity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol this is totally off topic and a rant but the NFL is really just a show- all the players are doped up because that&#39;s what people like to see and they crave it. I never fully understood why someone could say &quot;we won&quot; when they did jack shit to help out the &quot;team&quot; other then in helping full fill their massive contract payouts. If someone enjoyed sports, I don&#39;t see why people wouldn&#39;t try to be involved in ACTUALLY PLAYING.. unless of course they are disabled or something or the sort. When looking at events, I feel like i&#39;m distracting myself heavily when I watch tons of fitness channels and powerlifting meets n stuff on youtube and the sort and compare it to those who watch sports or other useless shows on television, but then i reassure myself that I&#39;m actually doing something for my own self improvement rather then hollering at a tv with a bowl of chips, my buddies and some beer :P</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not a good argument for anything.  Lots of thinks are distractions from social issues of the time.  Who says I&#39;m obligated to focus on them all the time? Who says people can&#39;t multitask? Its not like I ignore whats going on because I watch sport.  This isn&#39;t an either or situation like you are making it out to be.  Anything you enjoy doing, as a hobby, is by default not a waste of time since the point of the hobby to glean enjoyment from something.  </p>
