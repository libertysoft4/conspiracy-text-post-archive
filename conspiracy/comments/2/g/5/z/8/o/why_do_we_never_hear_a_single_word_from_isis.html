        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Considering, firstly, that they have many English speakers among their ranks, and presumably some of them have Internet access, why do we not see a single trace of them?</p>

<p>How is it that their sole communiqués with the western world come in the form of poxy beheading videos?</p>

<p>Surely such a &quot;well funded, well organized&quot; military/political movement has a PR department. When the world started hating on Israel recently during their Gaza death party, out came the JIDF shills in full force.</p>

<p>But we hear not a peep from ISIS at all.</p>

<p>Can anyone explain why? I&#39;m really curious.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not implying that that is what you meant, but I see a lot of people seriously discounting the fact that a person can make decent propaganda videos and still be a terrorist. The two are not mutually exclusive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>okay for the sake of argument... The equipment that was given to them was from desert storm/desert shield and during the Soviet invasion in the early 90&#39;s.  More recently they received our first gen. shit that we used in 2003.  (by the way fun little fact... that first gen equipment from 2003 WAS the leftovers from desert storm/desert shield.  back to topic.) we gave them this because it was so wrecked from our use.  I know this and can say this because I was there in 2003 using it and I was there in 2006,2007 and 2009 when we gave the same stuff to them.  So yes I do (REALIZE) it was well documented and that was done that way so when weak minded sheep aka the average us citizen hears in the news a us made missile was used against us, people like that think yeah we gave them some shit back in the day, the whole time not realizing the we still are funding them so our government can take more rights away from us to provide us with more false securities. so now they can say look at that threat do what we say and we will protect you... BULLSHIT!, it is our own government we need protected from fuck isis, they pose no threat to us, they are just shiny things to occupy our minds so the government can keep doing what it wants. rant over. sorry i got a little carried away </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t believe they&#39;re actually hardcore though, because the beheading videos were so unimpressive. I guess it&#39;s reassuring that they&#39;ll go so far as to prance around obstacle courses for us, but are a bit too squeamish to do anything <em>actually</em> horrific.</p>

<p>I suppose it could be that there are two ISISes, a real, actually brutal ISIS that&#39;s small and of negligible concern and the fake CIA/Mossad ISIS that MSM is trying to make look so fearsome but because they&#39;re not really allowed to kill anyone has to make silly videos and talk a big talk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That link is an 898MB file btw.</p>

<p>I&#39;m aware that there are quite a few very provocative videos from them (that we see during the MSM news montages), but I&#39;m talking about online discourse -- posts in forums, posts here on reddit, 4chan, anything.</p>

<p>I guess I haven&#39;t looked at forums on the TOR network, but surely someone who had and had interacted with them would at least post a screenshot.</p>

<p>I mean, why not have a dialogue with them (if they are real)? Couldn&#39;t the power of our collective persuasion mitigate their rage?</p>

<p>I could possibly accept &quot;cultural divide&quot; as a reason if there weren&#39;t apparently so many volunteer fighters from the west.</p>

<p>somebodys idea of a joke !? (cat recipes I could understand)</p>

<p>is this how they are recruiting all the lolzcat females to go fight/fuck for them !?</p>

<p>instead of &#39;Dey Took Our Jaaarrrrbs&#39; its &#39;Dey Took Our Wimmin&#39;</p>

<p>one way to rile up and motivate the average dumb teen male to sign up and go fight the imperial war, rescue the wimmin...</p>

<p>its a age old time proven system to get sex starved teens and older men to go and fight, the system was used against the native Americans, stories in newspapers (and pulp novels) of captured white women needing rescuing from savages.</p>

<p>soon you get hordes of &#39;white knights&#39; with the urge to kill the savages and rescue the grateful white women.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I&#39;ve found much more of it now. I think the source of my confusion was the assertion that ISIS is a big threat to the west on western soil. For me, it followed that if that was the case, they would be interacting in western media -- reddit/4chan/tumblr/western media blog comment sections etc.</p>

<p>Turns out they only give a shit about the middle east and they only talk about those topics (and mostly in Arabic).</p>

Why these men don&#39;t even try and put up a fight with their captors.  Might as well at least try and defend your people and go out with some dignity, right? </p>

They do mock executions all the time, so for weeks they march you force you into a ditch yell shit then pick you back up and leave, its just one day they really do fucking kill you. </p>

<p>Could have been beaten to piss prior. Everyone who resisted was already killed etc etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it crazy to think that perhaps they recruited someone who may have gone to film school? Or perhaps just someone with camera/video editing software know-how? Part of the CIA&#39;s involvement with radical Islam included teaching them how to effectively recruit. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not implying that that is what you meant, but I see a lot of people seriously discounting the fact that a person can make decent propaganda videos and still be a terrorist. The two are not mutually exclusive.</p>
