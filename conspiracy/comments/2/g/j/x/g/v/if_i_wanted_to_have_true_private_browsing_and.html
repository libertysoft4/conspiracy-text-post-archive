    <div class="md"><p>The entire internet is vulnerable to surveillance one way or another, unless you are communicating with true end to end encryption, with a privately (probably given over in person.) Anyone monitoring you would then have 3 choices. 1) Crack the encryption 2) Infect your computer 3) Break into your home/place where you keep your computer and copy the hard drive to either get the data or the encryption key.
This would only work when you can get a encryption key across to someone reliably, probably in person.</p>

<p>Security on your computer, use a bios encryption that means that they can&#39;t even boot into bios without the passkey, then an encrypted OS (a linux distro.) This means that the only way they can break in is 1) Brute force - v. difficult 2) Find the passkey/force it out of you 3) Break the software - find a bug or use one they inserted before it was even distributed to you 4) Use physical methods to monitor the flow of electricity in your computer, on your monitor etc (it is very possible.)</p>

<p>Obviously I haven&#39;t tried this or I wouldn&#39;t be here on an open conspiracy site where they could track me from XD</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Step 1 buy a laptop second hand with cash. Make buying arrangements over payphone.</p>

<p>Step 2 make sure to cover the laptops built in cameras.</p>

<p>Step 3 install a fresh copy of the OS with no personally identifying material on it.</p>

<p>Step 4 find open WiFi spots away from any ryp of surveillance cameras. No Starbucks McDonalds etc. Go driving around suburbs and such and piggyback on WiFi you find. Never use the same WiFi signal more than once if you are doing anything nefarious.</p>

<p>Step 5 if war driving for WiFi does not appeal to you buy a pay as you go cellphone. Again with cash. Preferably again from a second hand source like Craigslist. Next up set up the data plan and use tethering through the phone to give you an internet signal. Remember that the cell phone has built in cameras and GPS tracking as well. Do not stay in one place for extended periods of time and avoid using in places with surveillance cameras just assume that any surveillance camera is connected. Be prepared to switch Sim cards and phones as often as you can.</p>

<p>Step 6 TOR for all your anonymous internet needs for one more final step to anonymity</p>

<p>Step 7 when not using anonymized laptop and equipment remove batterys and store somewhere preferably not connecting to you personally.</p>

<p>Lastly keep using the internet at home like you normally would. Don&#39;t do anything with your normal internet that would bring undue attention to you. If you try to remain anonymous all the time you only put a giant target on you. In the times where everyone is databased and profiles if you drop off the face of the internet its a huge flag. Better to blend in and only be anonymous selectively.</p>

<p>remove the cam from the motherboard. also remove the mic and speakers, if you don&#39;t know why, find out. also remove bluetooth/3g/lan/wifi if present and unused. add micro-switches to both sides of the wifi aerial circuit if you want to keep or use the capability. buy a stand alone battery charger a spare battery and never connect the laptop itself to the mains or to anything else that is connected to the mains like a printer or amplifier. get a suitable anti-static faraday bag and then all you need to do is dream up a way to always keep it with you or a <strong>very</strong> safe place to hide it when not in use (do not trust locks)</p>

I visited the University of Cambridge a while ago and they were demonstrating wirelessly intercepting a screen from a decent distance away. It was low quality and black/white but enough to see what was going on. It was a fair distance away, so even then you probably aren&#39;t 100% safe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah the remote viewing of screen content is old hat, 20years old or more, they can can get a full clean screen but they have to know where and when to look for it and you not take any precautions to thwart it. like the window vibration  laser listening trick, embassies and tech co&#39;s pass pink noise direct to the windows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless they&#39;ve done some extra installation, that should have no effect. I would be highly surprised if pc power supplies had a secret module to inject a lan signal into your pc (and override all security), I think that&#39;s going a little too far. I think lan over power network usually only works up to your fusebox (and on the same phase), so any device planted would have to be inside your house.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if I assume you&#39;re right (got any more detail to show me?), the only thing you would theoretically need an independent power supply for is the mobo and cpu, you could maintain some things, such as fans on the mains still. The simplest method would be to go through a storage device though, which would act as a regular, tacking in mains (whatever that may actually entail) and outputting power that is definitely normal. (You don&#39;t even have to assume the conversion device isn&#39;t malicious, as long as it comes through a battery the two systems should be isolated from signals.)</p>
