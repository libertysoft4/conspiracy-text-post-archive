        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Modern medicine is so hopelessly invested in treating disease, there is almost no effort to actually find the root causes of disease. Many of the chronic, degenerative, autoimmune diseases &#39;officially&#39; have no known cause, but unofficially the causes have been known for a long time. Going to present a mini series of health for those that are interested. Why go on a run to raise money for big pharma when they won&#39;t address the underlying causes ?</p>

<p>Section 1 is about root canals.
The basic root canal procedure is as follows, drill off the top of the tooth, scoop out the living parts, attempt to sterilise and then rebuild the tooth.
<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Root_Canal_Illustration_Molar.svg">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Root_Canal_Illustration_Molar.svg</a></p>

<p>Problem 1
Root canals are presented as having a fairly simplistic structure, a single canal for each root that needs to be cleaned. They use files to remove the infected parts <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Pulp_tissue_removed_during_endodontic_therapy_by_a_size_20_broach_file.jpg">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Pulp_tissue_removed_during_endodontic_therapy_by_a_size_20_broach_file.jpg</a>
The problem is root canals frequently have complex structures, making mechanical removal of all the dead infected material impossible -&gt; <a href="http://i.imgur.com/tSto4T6.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/tSto4T6.jpg</a></p>

<p>Problem 2
The material (gutta-percha) they use to seal the ends of root canals shrinks upon cooling, leaving enough space for bacteria to to escape from the root tip.</p>

<p>Problem 3
While dentists focus heavily on attempting to clean and sterilize the canal there is a much larger part of the tooth which is essentially hollow that has shown scientifically impossible to fully sterilize in a patients mouth, the dentin -&gt; <a href="http://i.imgur.com/qKxjrGv.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/qKxjrGv.jpg</a> Each tooth has approximately 2 miles of dentin tubules that come off the central canal and project outwards towards the enamel. In a healthy tooth these tubules are filled with fluid that pushes outwards, protecting the tooth from bacterial invasion. In a dead/root canalled tooth, bacteria are free to multiply completely unhindered.</p>

<p>Problem 4
When a tooth dies the living part becomes necrotic and gangrenous. This necrosis pours out of the end of the tooth and frequently kills off the adjacent bone. Quite often it doesn&#39;t matter what you do in the way of sterilization to the tooth itself, that infection will be forever present in the surrounding bone. If you get frost bite and your fingers go black and die, antibiotics and other potions aren&#39;t going to bring your fingers back. The same applies to the bone around a dead tooth. Dentists believe simply doing a root canal and using antibiotics the bone will grow back healthy. This is what frequently happens -&gt; <a href="http://i.imgur.com/5HsrdnK.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/5HsrdnK.jpg</a> That would probably look normal on x-ray also. You can&#39;t bring back the dead.</p>

<p>In the 1920&#39;s there was a lot of research done in the safety of root canals. They found that, the only way to sterilize a tooth is to boil it for 30 minutes. No known chemicals no matter how powerful or toxic could fully penetrate to the dentin tubules to achieve full sterilization. Countless animal experiments were done on animals where they would take a tooth from someone that had died of some disease. They would attempt to sterilize it, then place the root tip or part of the tooth under the skin of a rabbit. The rabbit would get the same disease and die. They took the tooth out, repeated and got the same result with hundreds more animals.</p>

<p>One of the founders of the American endodontics society spent his whole life teaching about root canals. He then discovered this research done in the 1920s about the safety of root canals. He then destroyed his entire lifes work to warn about the dangers of root canals. He wrote a book about it which you can get here -&gt; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Root-Canal-Cover-George-Meinig/dp/0916764095">http://www.amazon.com/Root-Canal-Cover-George-Meinig/dp/0916764095</a> (The guy is dead, in case you are worried I am promoting his book.)</p>

<p>Maybe you are wondering about the modern research on root canals ? Well it&#39;s almost non existent. I did find this in a journal about implant failure. Implant surgeons couldn&#39;t understand the high failure rate of implants when sat next to root canalled teeth. They wrote this paper on it -&gt; <a href="http://i.imgur.com/bSEWcv3.png">http://i.imgur.com/bSEWcv3.png</a></p>

<p>There is a well documented video on the safety of root canals here -&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRrlgYqtDjM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRrlgYqtDjM</a> (yes the animation is hideous) </p>

<p>Personally for me the problem is informed consent. Patients don&#39;t want to lose teeth, and dentists want to bill for the treatment. The problem is patients don&#39;t know they are extremely bad for your health. If they did, the educated and informed individual might make a different choice.</p>

<p>TL:DR
Root canals are impossible to sterilize, and they pour a river of toxic crap into your body 24/7. They have been linked to many chronic and degenerative diseases.</p>

<p>If a dentist wants to make bank, why would they recommend antibiotics instead of charging the big dollars for procedures? </p>

<p>If I were a dentist and I wanted to fill my wallet i&#39;d say no to antibiotics because there&#39;s the chance they might work, wait till OP&#39;s jaw nearly falls off and then start adding a couple more digits to my bill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who works in the dental field, exams and x-rays pay absolutely nothing compared to real procedures.  If you get a patient in for an exam, x-ray, and send them to get a prescription, you are making about $43 if you are a participating dentist in their insurance networks (Delta pays $28 for an exam, $15 for an x-ray). $43 for 20-30 minutes of chair time is absolutely nothing.  A single root canal pays $450-650 for 1-2 hours of chair time. If you also do a post and crown on that tooth you can add $900 to that ($208 and $671 respectively again with Delta&#39;s schedule).  Subtract lab fees, which are usually a couple hundred unless you are a less scrupulous office that ships overseas, and that 1-2 hour of chair time is worth far, far more than &quot;just pack your schedule with patients and get through the list as quickly as possible.&quot;</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t even begin to touch on the higher cost procedures. Implants cost thousands ($4-5000) per tooth.  Cavitation like the OP had costs thousands.  The high end procedures cost a fortune and make a fairly decent amount of profit for the dentist or oral surgeon.  That also doesn&#39;t touch on specialists. If you go to an endodontist to get the same root canal, you can add upwards of $1000 to the prices I listed if they aren&#39;t in your insurance network.  A single procedure will eat every dime of your insurance maximum for the year and will still leave you with a huge bill out of pocket if you go to the wrong specialist or don&#39;t have the right one in your area (many don&#39;t have participating specialists within hours of them).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But to be fair, you make barely any money off the big procedures anyways, and very often lose money on the intensive stuff. It&#39;s simply not possible to run a general dentist office and do major intensive procedures, you lose every time.

</blockquote>

<p>If you live on a Coast or in the Southwest US, you would do yourself a great service by asking your dentist where they get their crowns, bridges, and dentures processed.  There are plenty of less scrupulous dental offices, and medical offices in general, that have no problem sourcing the material from China, Central America, etc. at a fraction of the price. This includes supplies too which are another big area where offices cut corners on costs to boost profits as part of the American cult of profits above all.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the office I work for sources our supplies from a product supplier right here in the Midwest that is mostly American made goods. Our crowns and bridges are manufactured about an hour and a half away upstate and our dentures are manufactured about 20 minutes from where I am sitting right now. It costs upwards of 10x more than shipping to China would, but its worth not putting lead-based dentures and porcelain over lead crowns into patient&#39;s mouths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are a nut. If i solely wanted to profit I wouldn&#39;t fix cavities I&#39;d wait till they got huge and you needed pulp therapy / crowns...Or for the infection to spread into bone / soft tissue facial planes.</p>

<p>Actually shit lets rip out those teeth and put in some implants... personally I&#39;m getting a root canal and keeping somewhat the feel of natural teeth in my mouth, and I&#39;m a dentist. If you wanted to really know instead of just posting anecdotal info, you whould find people actually educated and who understand the field to comment with you. Do a survey of dentists to see if they would get RCT or extraction.... This is a joke, but good fear mongering / conspiracy to get ppl&#39;s attention. Its an intersting style of writing</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dentist here. This is bullshit. Antibiotics don&#39;t do a damn thing long term if you haven&#39;t eliminated the source if infection. Once you do that with either extraction or root canal therapy antibiotics aren&#39;t needed unless the infection has spread outside of bone to surrounding tissues (swelling). Ive never met a Dentists that didn&#39;t know this.</p>

<p>Also about your comment that there is no current endodontic research. What do think l be learning at the advanced endodontic 2 day seminar I&#39;m going to this weekend?  The particular speaker emphasizes which sources were used and highlights the research that goes into the info presented.</p>

<p>Also the cavitation surgery you spoke about is more commonly called curettage and it is he standard of care to perform curettage after every extraction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So they do specific pathology on the bone after RC therapy ?  Maybe they even extract the teeth and cut them in half at certain time periods after treatment to find out what&#39;s growing inside them ? They don&#39;t just rely on x-ray to say, oh look the infection looks like it&#39;s gone ? Surely not ..</p>

<p>Most dentists have no understanding of the limits of x-ray. You could have a hole so large you could stick your finger inside of it, and it might not show up on x-ray. I know you must be reading this thinking, yes this guy is full of shit. I would think that.</p>

<p>But have a look at this it&#39;s my cavitation and that&#39;s exactly what happened.

    <div class="md"><p>Typically we expect bone to heal within 6 weeks after root canal therapy. Some people heal faster/slower than others and it&#39;s not out of the question for infection to persist months after the procedure. We monitor endo treated teeth with clinical exam and yes, x-Ray. Combine those findings with any patient symptoms to determine success/failure. If it looks fine on the 2D image and the patient is symptomatic we can refer to specialist for cone beam ct and/or retreat.  If it looks fine and the patient is not symptomatic we are thinking success but keep monitoring the patient/tooth in future. Could a low grade infection sit there invisible to xray, clinical exam, and without any symptoms? Sure. Is it going to be detrimental to the patients health? No. At some point if it progresses to the point where we can diagnosis we will fix it hopefully before it progresses to a point where it does affect patients health. RCTs don&#39;t always work but have about a 85-97% success rate.</p>

<p>Those pictures tell me basically nothing if I don&#39;t know the history of the tooth. And I CAN see the defect on the 2D image. It looks like an extraction site that hasn&#39;t healed yet. Again, I&#39;d need context here.</p>

<p>Can you find me a Dentist that thinks 2D images show the whole picture?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you&#39;ve described about RC is anecdotal, it&#39;s not based on science. You&#39;ve no idea how long they stay sterile, what bacteria or fungi are growing in there. What systemic effects this kind of infection could cause. What exactly is going on in the bone around the teeth. Science has shown in cadaver studies that the bone around these teeth is chronically infected in 90+ % of cases, regardless of x-ray. I am not totally against RC, but patients aren&#39;t given informed consent. They do not know the full dangers of retaining a dead tooth.</p>

<p>As for my cavitation pictures, the x-ray and MRI were done roughly 18 months after I had my horizontally impacted wisdom tooth and the adjacent molar extracted. I also had CT done at the same time (i can post the pictures later) of the area by the surgeon that extracted my wisdom teeth, and he couldn&#39;t see anything at all. It only showed up really on the MRI. Cavitations were first described by GV Black, and then basically forgotten about, however they exist and are surprisingly common. Seen a shadow where a tooth was extracted 1 year previous? It&#39;s probably a cavitation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a dentist, and this just isn&#39;t true. There are very strict guidelines for prescribing antibiotic treatment and for the most part, they are not needed in dentistry unless fever or swelling are present. We treat the source of infection- the necrotic tooth- with root canal therapy. Do some teeth fail due to complex root anatomy? Yes. But it is an effective treatment modality? You bet. The statistics on success far outweigh the statistics on failure. That my friend we call the risk/benefit ratio. Also, enucleation and excision of tissue is a very pervasive procedure in dentistry. Wound debridement is medical school 101. Remove source of infection and allow the bone to remodel or the soft tissue to fill in. Watch your sources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on how you define success. Even a necrotic tooth with no RC might fall under your clinical definition of success. They don&#39;t all blow out in abscesses. Will that tooth be a source of infection in the body ? Of course. You know bone abscesses cause infarctions ? That&#39;s generally not something that can be fixed, once the blood supply is constrained the tissue just dies. Have you ever even seen a jawbone cavitation ? Do you know what one is ?

It was also completely invisible to x-ray, completely invisible to CT, but showed up like a sore thumb on the MRI. I even sat in the hospital and waited to see the head of the maxillofacial department about it. He just wrote it off as &#39;normal&#39; and refused me treatment. The European president of the IAOMT operated on it. He basically saved my life.</p>

<p>There is more to learn than what you were taught in dental school. Could you ever imagine in your wildest dream that a hole that big could be invisible to x-ray ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically yes. The &#39;cleaning&#39; is actually similar to how an implant surgeon prepares the socket after an extraction. Why regular dentists don&#39;t do this for extractions is an interesting question</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once the tooth root has been extracted, it is imperative to thoroughly debride the socket walls. This is best undertaken with a surgical spoon curette. This part of the procedure should not be rushed; each area within the extraction socket needs to be curetted and all remnant periodontal ligament tissues removed from the socket walls. This has the added advantage of inducing some bleeding (increased vascularity) into the socket. Occasionally, you may note that the extraction sockets fails to show much in the way of vascularity (such as in the mandibular arch) and this may necessitate the need to use a very small round bur to carefully perforate the cortical place within the extraction socket. It is important to invoke bleeding into the socket as a good blood supply is required for good wound healing. </p>

<p>Basically they cut down to healthy bone until it starts to bleed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now you lost your tooth right? And the wound healed over but you don&#39;t have an infection on your jaw bone because of this procedure? </p>

<p>I have been postponing a root canal for over a year. I got everything done but the last half of the operation. I made them do it in two parts because I was having complications with the numbing shots. They said if I didn&#39;t come back within 3 months then I&#39;d be in horrible pain and yet it still feels fine to me 11 months later. To be honest, it never hurt and I repeatedly told them that it was only my wisdom teeth that cause me pain regularly, both in the tooth and jaw. </p>

<p>I sometimes hope it&#39;s because I use novamin toothpaste that my 1/2 root canal operation has lasted so long but realistically I&#39;m probably just causing myself a heap of trouble down the line. I am seeing a new dentist next month and I&#39;m thinking extraction might be best but again I don&#39;t want to lose the tooth as it has never caused me pain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I looked into this subject a while back. This was actually the first thing that led me to distrust Big Pharma so much. </p>

<p>The worst part is it doesnt stop there. Oral hygiene, according to some of the articles i read, could be implicated in many diseases, throughout the body. The issue, as you have pointed out, is the incubation of bacteria that are all over inside your mouth. Most of the bacteria are good, offering a symbiotic relationship to us. These typically grow freely, and take up much of the space and &quot;food&quot; needed for the bad bacteria to grow, keeping the bad bacteria in check. </p>

<p>When this balance is thrown off, the bad bacteria get a chance to multiply freely, producing toxins that then get absorbed into your body. Sublingually, this can go straight into your blood stream and affect your entire body, causing systemic issues. </p>

<p>This was one of the issues brought up about fluoride, as well. By killing off all the bacteria in your mouth, you are essntially wiping the slate clean, allowing for fresh competition of the good vs bad bacterium. Most of the time, the good bacteria wins. But sometimes the bad ones win, even if for a moment. This can cause a lot of issues, that are then &quot;diagnosed&quot; as other ailments. Not all of the time, but sometimes.</p>

<p>In the case of the root canals you are mentioning, of anyone is doubting OP, id recommend further research. It really is stunning. </p>

<p>As an anecdote, all my life i have only brushed my teeth as needed. Typically once a day. I also drink a full glass of water just before bed, and right when waking up. I also drink water (and swish it around) after <em>every</em> meal and snack (even after drinking soda or other sugary drinks like juice, even after i drink milk). </p>

<p>I have done this my entire life, and have never had a cavity, never had any form of periodontal disease, and never had gingivitis or halitosis or issues with my gums. </p>

<p>Everyone else that i know who brush their teeth the &quot;recommended&quot; three times a day, have had at least one cavity in their lifetime. Of those whom i know, the ones that dont drink water as i have described it, also have other oral issues, such as halitosis, inflammation of the gums, etc. </p>

<p>Everytime i visit my dentist, they are very happy, and always say, &quot;you must brush your teeth often!&quot; Imagine their shock when i remind them that at best i brush my teeth only one third of the recommended amount of times. </p>

<p>It wasnt until i started smoking cigarettes that my gums started to show a little bit of inflammation.</p>

<p>But anyway, OP, right on. Good post!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>again, someone who doesn&#39;t hve actual education trying to draw conclusions by reading a few incomplete anecdotes on the internet.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t brush and remove the biofilm, more of the &#39;bad&#39; bacteria begin to dominate. Hence when you brush and &#39;wipe the slate clean&#39; you allow the good bacteria to be in higher levels. Hence why you brush - and there&#39;s a reason you brush 2x a day. It takes 12-24 hours for the bacteria to start shifting balance to mroe Gram negative bacteria (bad bacteria). SO you wipe the late clean about every 12 hours to allow G+ to remain the dominant species. </p>

<p>Your practice of brushing 1x a day and drinking water is sort of a substitute - you allow the G+ to remain mostly dominant, drinking the water after meals help wash away the sugars that are foods to the G- bacteria who produce acid - so less is produced. Also prevents dry mouth especially at night, saliva has a natural protection effect</p>

<p>You see, there are studies conducted by folks who have degrees in this field and have studied this stuff their entire life. I drew my conclusions from those, not anecdotes. <em>(Admittingly, i did provide my own anecdote, as i hope you noticed. That was in an attempt to provide further reasoning for my own opinion, not to state as fact or to serve as recommendation to others my personal oral hygiene practices.)</em> These are the studies and opinions that i have decided to respect over the profiteers&#39; opinions. Poor oral hygiene does, in fact, effect a poorer state of health overall, if left unchecked. Also, with people who have a less robust immune system, this issue is compounded further. </p>

<p>Your next two paragraphs were very informative, and i appreciate the depth you offer.</p>

<p>Thanks for correcting me, here. I guess my claim of whats recommended was outdated (correct me if im wrong, but it <em>used</em> to be recommended three times a day/after each meal, right?)</p>

<p>I can assume you have some background on this subject, but due to your arrogance, i cannot respect further discourse with you if you choose to nurture that negative attribute. </p>

<p>If you choose to abandon that arrogance, id like to know why you believe OPs post is, &quot;total bullshit for so many reasons.&quot; Surely, if there are so many reasons, and keeping in line with the assumption that you have some background on the subject, you shouldnt have any trouble explaining in detail why you believe this.</p>

I&#39;m only responding to you because you don&#39;t sound quite as far gone as many of the people posting, but we&#39;ll see. None of the procedures purported by the IAOMT, IABDM or &#39;holistic dentists&#39; are supported by any credible science. None of what&#39;s claimed about RCT&#39;s leading to x/y/z holds water against any scientific scrutiny. This kind of &#39;dentist&#39; exists to target a particular population and make bank off of them with scare tactics, gotcha terminology (natural, mercury-free, non-toxic, etc), and trust that they make quite a bit of money off of it all. The quackwatch summary on it is pretty good:  <a href="http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/holisticdent.html">http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/holisticdent.html</a></p>

<p>As per your anecdotal experience, it&#39;s not surprising. There&#39;s plenty of data showing that you only &#39;need&#39; to brush every 1-2 days to maintain health, though I wouldn&#39;t recommend it. Brushing technique is an extremely important factor, and it may very well be that your brushing technique is exactly where it needs to be. You could also have a low caries risk diet, good salivary flow, etc. There&#39;s so many co-factors that go into your risk of developing dental disease. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting read. I found a few lines i thought were good enough to look into:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Dr.] Price also performed poorly designed studies that led him to conclude that teeth treated with root canal therapy leaked bacteria or bacterial toxins into the body, causing arthritis and many other diseases. This &quot;focal infection&quot; theory led to needless extraction of millions of endodontically treated teeth until well-designed studies, conducted during the 1930s, demonstrated that the theory was not valid [1,2].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Founded in 1999, it advocates holistic dentistry, <strong><em>organic farming</em></strong>, raw (unpasteurized) milk, and many questionable dietary strategies. It also opposes fluoridation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That second one was referring to that association of holistic dentists or whatever. I included it to indicate to you the things that put me off in such debates --- whether coming from the &quot;theorists&#39;&quot; side or the medical establishments&#39; side. What im specifically indicating is their mentioning of organic farming, lumping such practice into the others, and categorizing all of them as &quot;dubious.&quot; While ibmay agree that some are quite dubious, organic farming is going to be a tough one to convince me. Not to mention, its quite the strawman, as it isnt relevant towards the dentistry. </p>

<p>Anywho, i looked into some other articles. Heres one from aae.org:</p>

<p>The next two quotes are from <a href="http://www.aae.org/patients/treatments-and-procedures/root-canals/myths-about-root-canals-and-root-canal-pain.aspx">HERE</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>endodontic treatment confined to the root canal system produces much less trauma and a much lower incidence and magnitude of bacteria entering the blood stream.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As recently as 2013, research published in JAMA Otolaryngology—Head &amp; Neck Surgery, found that patients with multiple endodontic treatments had a 45 percent reduced risk of cancer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given this, as well as some other things ive found in my hour long investigation today, motivates me to revisit my position on this subject. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>They mentioned a &quot;reduced&quot; risk of cancer, and other diseases. Contrary to the theorists position, i was interested. This quote is from a more recent publication, and along with that, a more modern knowledge in this field of study. Being from 2013, the statistics available to them shoukd he expected to he quite different from the previous articles ive looked into. Thus, they should reflect the phenomena inherent in scientific studies, wherein such procedures are optimized, made to be more efficient and safe. This is something i feel both sides of the argument are missing from their analyses of the other.</p></li>
<li><p>I never knew that the claim against root canals stemmed from the early 20th century, a statement supported by several sources, i have found. There is a pattern beginning to emerge, here.</p></li>
<li><p>For the sake of brevity, ill surmise that the sensationalism contained within both sides of the argument stem from the difference in the era of which each sides argument arouse. In the case against root canals, we would be foolish to believe our practical knowledge of such, and our skill level thereof, would indeed bring about many contradictions and issues related to the procedure. But as science evolves, as well as our understanding of medical practices, i guess it would also be foolish to believe these things were never figured out and expounded upon, and thusly improved. In the case of the current root canal procedures, im on the fence, to be honest. Im not particularily passionate about the specificities regarding this subject, as i have always had good oral health. But nonetheless, i am open to further investigation and research. But not without contigencies.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You see, i deeply distrust Big Pharma. Sincerely. It is, to me, one of the best examples of corruption one could present. Thats not to say there arent good docs out there. I believe there are many truthful, good doctors. Who patently are concerned for the wellbeing of others. I see three different types of doctors:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Corrupted. They are concerned with their own affluence, and peddle tests, procedures, and pharmaceuticals purely for profitable reasons. They tend to be in collusion with politicians and government officials (mainly from the FDA). </p></li>
<li><p>Corrupted-subsidiary. These are the doctors who have become indoctrinated by the first category. They truely wish to do good by others, but because of their mentors, they peddle the same things unknowingly helping the first category to increase their profits only. I sympathize with these doctors, because they do harm (sometimes) when they truely believe they are doing good.</p></li>
<li><p>The Anathema. I empathize with those doctors who are chastised for standing up against the unethical mentalities of the first category. They are chastised for placing people before profits, and they truely are concerned for the wellbeing of others. Typucally, their pay reflects this, but thats not always the case.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Coming full circle, now. I have not rwad a single article for or against root canals thst did not include ad hominem (directed towards the other group), strawman arguments, or other logical fallacies to support their claims. They are both vague with details, and when asked, typically respond with something like, &quot;It took me x amount of yrs to lesrn this, and to understand it. There is no way i can explain it to an uneducated person like yourself in a way that you will understand, too.&quot; </p>

<p>That is my main concern on controversial arguments such as this. And, as it so happens, BiG Pharma uses this ideology all the time. They usually spend more time discreditting others than supporting themselves. If we continue to live in a world where this is okay, we all fall. </p>

<p>So i am left to my own device, choosing for myself whst to believe based on my own research. I will never trust big pharma as long as they are in cohorts with the FDA, and as long as they continue to be more concerned with profitting than disseminating wellfare. </p>

<p>This is why i am now on the fence. If you care to include any other inciteful sources or trinkets of knowledge, feel free. I try to remain open to opposing views, as that is the only way ,imo, to evolve and optimize ones position in any regard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I will address the reasons in a bit later, not much time now. I did quickly google search and came across this article
<a href="http://www.hugginsappliedhealing.com/root-canals-toxic.php">http://www.hugginsappliedhealing.com/root-canals-toxic.php</a></p>

<p>This article refers to a lot of the claims made in the post. 
First of all, the goal of root canal therapy is not to make teeth 100% free of bacteria (aseptic), it is to reduce the bacterial load.</p>

<ul>
<li>This concept is used in many aspects of medicine. Many goals of therapy are to keep bacteria levels below a threshold level so they cannot overcome our own bodies natural defenses. Glance around about bacteriostatic vs bacteriocidal antibiotics and treatments</li>
</ul>

<p>-In RCT, you remove the source of infection. clean and shape the canals and reduce bacterial loads. You then fill the tooth with inert material and seal it. No one is saying that it will remain a perfectly sealed environment and bacteria from surrounding structures wont ever seep back into the canal. In fact I think the research shows that the seal at the apex is compromised within a few months, and the coronal seal is more important. My understanding is that the resident bacteria and bacterial makeup is kept within check as long as external substrates from the oral cavity aren&#39;t introduced, hence why if the coronal seal is intact they showed that bacterial loads were in check and it was more non pathogenic bacetria that did make its way into the canal. If the coronoal end seal breaks, than saliva and all of that worse bacteria has the opportunity to invade -&gt; leading to a <em>failed root canal.</em></p>

<p>The stats in that article are not statisticaly significant. The sample sizes are way too small, and they talk about how x bacteria was found in x percent - of course. There are thousands of differnet types of bacteria in your mouth. Hundreds have been implicated in different pathological processes (some are seen in cavities, some in soft tissue issues, some in nerve infections, some seen in all of them etc) -&gt; thus they would be expected to be seen...
If the article made a claim that all ALS patietnes had a specific bacterial genome makeup that would warrent further study (not conclusion). As in if they found that 100 ALS patients had the same levels of bacteria 1,2,3,4,5 and none of bacetria 6, etc etc (very complex makeup that is similar enough), then maybe. Picking and choosing to make statements about the top 15 common bacterias involved in these varying pathologies does not mean a thing</p>

<p>So RCT (root canal) removes the pathogenic bacteria in the canal and seals the tooth, preventing the reintroduction of new pathogenic bacteria within the canal. The procedure is not completed in an totally sterile environment (such as a surgical operating room).</p>

<p>edit: If you had a combined perio-endo lesion than its imperative to treat both conditions otherwise pathogenic bacteria can easily reach the apex and infect the canal system. Again its most important to keep the bacterial loads in check, not completely absent</p>

    <div class="md"><p>About a year and a half a go I went to the dentist for the first time in over ten years. Other than some scale build up around the gum line she picked off with a dental pick easily she was amazed at how good my teeth were. I told her flat out I floss daily, but brush maybe once a day otherwise. I do as you do, rinses and the odd xylitol based mouth wash rinse. I haven&#39;t had a cavity since I was still a pre-teen. I fear the possibility of  my dentist informing me I need a root canal, but take a sick satisfaction in knowing one day I&#39;ll get to tell a former coworker &quot;I told you so&quot; when I told them to research the health implications of the procedure before getting his own done. </p>

<p>Tell them &quot;I don&#39;t want to get a root canal.&quot; It seems the fact you&#39;re asking the quoted question here and not telling your dentist how you feel is what led to <a href="/u/hack_jealousy">/u/hack_jealousy</a>&#39;s edit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I don&#39;t think there are any great solutions to missing teeth. Leaving a gap might cause the adjacent teeth to shift into that spot, which may or may not be a problem. As for implants, they can potentially create a window from the outside world, directly inside your body. Natural teeth aren&#39;t connected directly to the bone, they are connected to the periodontal ligaments. These same ligaments cushion the bone and also act as a bacterial seal protecting it. The dentist that treated me wrote this about implants .. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/hB1M3VA.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/hB1M3VA.jpg</a> The same guy used to place them for 20 years.</p>

<p>Root canals were created based on bad science, and because dentists are not doctors, very few doctors ask patients about root canals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, but I would doubt you could reverse dementia even if you can remove all infections. Some damage is irreversible. If you get your legs blown off, they aren&#39;t coming back. There is definitely a strong link to heart disease and cancer though.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not uncommon for the elderly to get even mild infections that cause symptoms of dementia, the dementia will reverse when the infection is cured. Example: urinary tract infections are well known to cause symptoms of dementia in the elderly.

<p>Mother in law suffered this. Every time she started acting strange we knew she had a urinary infection. Pure, Organic cranberry juice cleared it every time and her mental capacity would return to normal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on how you define success. Even a necrotic tooth with no RC might fall under your clinical definition of success. They don&#39;t all blow out in abscesses. Will that tooth be a source of infection in the body ? Of course. You know bone abscesses cause infarctions ? That&#39;s generally not something that can be fixed, once the blood supply is constrained the tissue just dies. Have you ever even seen a jawbone cavitation ? Do you know what one is ? Here was mine -&gt; <a href="http://imgur.com/a/92WQC">http://imgur.com/a/92WQC</a></p>

<p>I went all over the country trying to get someone to fix that. It was almost large enough to stick your finger inside. It was also completely invisible to x-ray, completely invisible to CT, but showed up like a sore thumb on the MRI. I even sat in the hospital and waited to see the head of the maxillofacial department about it. He just wrote it off as &#39;normal&#39; and refused me treatment. The European president of the IAOMT operated on it. He basically saved my life.</p>

<p>There is more to learn than what you were taught in dental school. Could you ever imagine in your wildest dream that a hole that big could be invisible to x-ray ?</p>
