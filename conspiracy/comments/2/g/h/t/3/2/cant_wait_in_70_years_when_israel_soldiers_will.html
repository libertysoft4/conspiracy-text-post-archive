<p>looks like the chinese and russians are a good candidate. putin war against russian jewish oligarchs is known. part of the people who are at war with putin now is made of rich jewish clans. they may win against putin or they may lose but if is one army they can fear is not some arabs beheading camel riders but the russian army.</p>

<p>I have yet to see a single reason why I deserve execution! Having divergent political views is something that conspiracy theorists are supposed to respect. I thought you guys were all about finding the truth, and yet, you would murder me for having a differing point of view.</p>

<p>I think that the real criminal policy here is yours: murder those who have different views than my own.</p>

<p>Unconscionable and unjustifiable. Truly, you&#39;ve put your foot in your own mouth, my friend. Think hard before you reply, please.</p>

<p>I certainly doubt Israel assembles portable rocket launching stations on top of, or under, or in schools and densely populated areas either.</p>

<p>But in my opinion, everyone who does not live in Israel or Palestine should just delete their comments and go home.</p>

<p>Preferably only people who are fighting this war should post.</p>

<p>People who actually know.</p>

<p>Because the mainstream media only reports the &quot;interesting&quot; stuff not the details.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s always lies, usually it isn&#39;t, but sometimes it turns out to be &quot;lying via withholding&quot; because they only skimmed details off of the top.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I lied.</p>

<p>If we saw any bodies in the Gaza event, there were marked few deaths of &quot;uniformed soldiers, Hamas Terrorists&quot;. </p>

<p>(I do not watch MSM/News...)</p>

<p>We saw a few pissy bottle rockets fired from Gaza and one or two unconfirmed deaths in Israel.</p>

<p>Watching The Iron Dome as a Joke?</p>

<p>Sure. </p>

<p>Star Wars.</p>

<p>Pop Bottle Rockets.</p>

<p>Israel creamed Gaza, again! </p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>You either care about innocent people that had nothing to do with this or you condone Genocide. </p>

<p>Israel, Hamas, USA do not give a nano fuck about Gaza! </p>

<p>I do!</p>

<p>These are the images from 2008 - Israel Slaughtering innocent people:</p>

<p>I&#39;m not offended. I&#39;m telling you the big bombs and  monies line the pockets of the Elite and fuck all the rest. </p>

<p>They Run and Hide...</p>

<p>Hmmmm? </p>

<p>Hamas? Mossad? </p>

<p>Cripps Blood?</p>

<p>ISIS? ISIL?</p>

<p>Follow the money.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t really give a piss squat pee-diddle if you can&#39;t understand, at this point!</p>

<p>Bottle rockets.....</p>

<p>ISRAEL:</p>

<p>White Phosfferrooussss NOPE! NOPE! NOPE! </p>

<p>DEPLETED URANIUM!!!!!!   NOPE! NOPE! NOPE! </p>

<p>Targets of Gaza in 2008 were largely ignored due to the <em>Presidential</em> event... Yes! You know! Wipe out some &quot;pesky&quot; Gazans!</p>

<p>Meanwhile thousands of American Troops were deployed with ammunition grade weapons full of depleted uranium and those pesky little toy soldiers shot that shit all over Iraq and themselves. </p>

<p>A few people were running around with their hair on fucking fire!</p>

<p>History will repeat this story, crazy as it sounds: One Black Chick and one White British Dude got a few people gathered and they were shot at, they were attacked, they were beat down because they wanted to Feed and Save Paestine!</p>

<p>Now you:</p>

<p>gram_her_knot_sea</p>

<p>Give me your story of Gaza, in perfect language!</p>

I am making two statements. 1) israeli soldiers caused massive destruction. 2) israeli soldiers only killed a small number of people.
