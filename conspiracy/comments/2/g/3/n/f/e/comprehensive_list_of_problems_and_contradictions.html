        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>-------------------------------------------------------THE AIRPORTS</p>

<p>19 alleged terrorists (to be referred just as terrorists from now on) were able to avoid hundreds of airport CCTVs, except 3.
Of those 3, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLEqjpHVPhM">one of the recordings</a> (which will be named Dulles from now on) that was only <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5485376/ns/us_news-security/t/sept-panelcriticizes-dullessecurity-screeners/">released in 2004</a> poses a serious problem:</p>

<p>At least until the date of the 9/11, all of the CCTVs available (including the Pentagons&#39;) only recorded at 1-5FPS and had timestamps while the Dulles was recording at +12FPS(if I am not mistaken) and has no timestamp.</p>

<p>The airports, which the terrorists used, have hundreds of CCTVs that cover the entrances and all of the public areas, yet only 1 camera from 2 airports (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLEqjpHVPhM">Dulles</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNVWpjOjLe0">Portland, Maine</a>) were able to capture 6 of the 19 terrorists.
The airplane victims were also never captured by the airport CCTVs. In contrast, here is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5Ie1uLT5AA">constant tracking via CCTV</a> of the navy yard shooting using all the CCTVs that captured the shooter outside and inside the building.
Somehow the Logan airport failed to record a single victim and/or terrorist.</p>

<p>--------------------------------------------------------THE HIJACKS</p>

<p>Every pilot and co-pilot is instructed with transponder squawk codes, one of them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UZiQUNl76M&amp;t=46">-7500-</a> is the code for <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=57d_1392620694">hijacking</a> and it takes 3s to input and send.
Despite having 4 pilots and 4 co-pilots, not one of them sent out the 3s squawk as they were instructed to.
The alleged Flight11&#39;s FDR shows that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzR-q0ijbV0&amp;t=251">the airplane was too high</a> to have struck the lamp posts.
Todd Beamer, one of Flight93&#39;s passenger, described the hijack occuring as he was speaking (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/5Vx2cxf.jpg">at 9:43 AM</a>) when in fact this event had already happened <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93#Hijacking">~20 minutes earlier.</a></p>

<p>--------------------------------------------------------<strong>THE CRASHES</strong></p>

<p>-------------------------THE PENTAGON-------------------------------</p>

<p>Only 2 cameras recorded an object crashing into the Pentagon, one recorded only a flash.
The 2 cameras that recorded the object show a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/EvtM7nN.jpg">white smoke</a> coming from the object that the Flight77 could not have produced:</p>

<p>Engine damage from lamp-posts impact: Not possible, airplane engine smoke produces a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KhZwsYtNDE">thin and dark smoke</a></p>

<p>Fuel leaking from tank damage or engine damage: Not possible, it didn&#39;t catch fire when the airplane exploded, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/dJkv2XB.jpg">the lawn has no jetfuel burn marks.</a></p>

<p>Contrails: Not possible seen that the humidity levels were not enough, corroborated by the lack of those on both airplanes that crashed into the twin towers</p>

<p>Condensation: Not possible, same reason as contrails</p>

<p>Rocket/missile-like smoke: Strongly resembles the smoke produced by <a href="http://i.imgur.com/WXrH3vv.jpg">missiles/rockets</a> and <strong>might</strong> explain why Pentagon personnel stated that they noticed the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Even+before+stepping+outside+I+could+smell+the+cordite">smell of cordite</a></p>

<p>These 2 cameras have all frames perfectly synchronized -including the moment of the high speed explosion- except the one where the object enters the frame. According to the cameras, the airplane existed in 2 different places in the same moment of time.</p>

<p>-------------------------THE PENNSYLVANIA---------------------------</p>

<p>Despite the entire airplane allegedly plunged into the ground, one of the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/CvyJNQw.png">engines jumped to a considerable distance from the crash site.</a> This engine was attached to the same airplane as the other one, diving at the same speed as the other one and hitting the same ground as the other one, yet one of the engines was buried and the other landed far away for no reason.</p>

<p>The engine that was buried under the ground was <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4IcZzuY.jpg">compressed along it&#39;s length under ~3 and half feet of dirt.</a> This engine had a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/r0dxyQB.jpg">clam shell</a> of considerable proportions, but for some reason not one part of that shell is present in the previously linked photo of the engine.</p>

<p>There were debris found at such a distance from the impact point of the airplane that it could not have been covered from its explosion, this path of debris suggests that the airplane was actually <a href="http://i.imgur.com/dmTLqpx.gif">flying on the opposite direction</a> and not the one officially told. This also fits <a href="http://i.imgur.com/TF5vSXo.png">Val MacClatchey&#39;s testimony of the plane path.</a></p>

<p>Val MacClatchey&#39;s famous photo poses a serious problem, it displays a mushroom cloud that is <a href="http://i.imgur.com/P0bEagi.jpg">consistent with an explosion and not with a jet crash.</a> When an airplane crashes it produces a long column of smoke, not just a mushroom cloud. The lack of typical airplane crash aftermath smoke has also been confirmed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frtqTM5rUes">another witness.</a></p>

<p>In contrast with Flight 93, here is an airplane crash of a Boeing 737-200 of 17,November 2013 that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koUV3xRIraU">nose dived</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatarstan_Airlines_Flight_363#Crash">70º</a> and still had plenty of <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2509388/Video-shows-Boeing-737-plane-crash-Russia-killing-50-people.html">easily identifiable airplane parts</a> and <a href="http://rt.com/news/kazan-crash-live-updates-876/">both engines were found in the same location.</a></p>

<p>Here you can see more airplane crashes comparisons with Flight 93 and see how unique Flight 93 was. <a href="http://killtown.911review.org/flight93/crash-comparisons.html">http://killtown.911review.org/flight93/crash-comparisons.html</a></p>

<p>----------------------------------------------------------THE CALLS</p>

<p>There are 2 calls that contradict the offical version of events; the before mentioned <a href="http://i.imgur.com/MkjKRCV.png">Todd Beamer call and Jeremy Glick&#39;s.</a></p>

<p>Todd Beamer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flight 93 hijack occured at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93#Hijacking">9:28</a></p>

<p>Todd Beamer&#39;s call describes the hijack about to happen at <a href="http://intelfiles.egoplex.com/2001-09-11-FBI-FD302-lisa-jefferson.pdf">9:43</a></p>

<p>Flight 93 crashed at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_93#Crash">10:03</a></p>

<p>Todd Beamer&#39;s call made with an airphone last for <a href="http://i.imgur.com/MkjKRCV.png">3925 seconds.</a> It last 45 minutes <em>after</em> the plane had already crashed.</p>

<p>Lisa Jefferson also confirms that the call was not lost: <a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/Inspiration/2006/06/I-Promised-I-Wouldnt-Hang-Up.aspx?p=2">&quot;We didn’t lose a connection because there’s a different sound that you use. It’s a squealing sound when you lose a connection. I never lost connection, but it just went silent.&quot;</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jeremy Glick:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Call starts at 9:37</p>

<p>Flight 93 crashes at 10:03</p>

<p>Call lasts for 7565 seconds, placing the end of the call at 11:41. It last for 1 hour and ~38 minutes <em>after</em> the plane had already crashed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These calls were made from the airplane&#39;s airphone destined to two different interfaces: One was to the GTE&#39;s assistant landline telephone, the other was to a cellphone.</p>

<p>These calls could not have remained connected by a system mistake because airphones charge per time, the system was built to only count the time the client is connected in order to avoid overcharging him by allowing calls to &quot;stay connected&quot; when they were not. The fact that they also disconnected at different times rules out any possible system fault which, if possible, would at best disconnect both calls at the same time since they would have &quot;disconnected&quot; at the same time, the time of the crash.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://pilotsfor911truth.org/ACARS-CONFIRMED-911-AIRCRAFT-AIRBORNE-LONG-AFTER-CRASH.html">ACARS data also corroborates the above,</a> seen that the only possible explanation for the calls to remain connected after the airplane crashed is that the airplane from where the calls came from never crashed in the first place.</p>

<p>--------------------------------------------<strong>THE TOWERS&#39; COLLAPSES</strong></p>

<p>-------------------------SOUTH TOWER--------------------------------</p>

<p>The section above the airplane impact zone tilted and then fell vertically, violating Newton&#39;s First Law of Motion in which a body in motion (rotation in this case) tends to stay in motion unless acted on by an outside force. In this case <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcQOODryBDw">this was the expected movement of the top</a> if it was simply collapsing.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the top section tilted and was only ~30%(33floors) of the building it was still capable of destroying the remaining ~69%(76 floors) completely, directly violating Newton&#39;s third law.</p>

<p>-------------------------NORTH TOWER--------------------------------</p>

<p>A problem with this collapse is that despite the fact that the top section fell vertically and almost symetrically, it can be clearly identified a concentrated destruction almost as fast as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKYW89xEYg0&amp;t=26">debris fall occuring on the right face of the building.</a></p>

<p>Sharing the exact same result as the South Tower, the North tower also violates Newton&#39;s third law by an even larger margin. The top section was only 15.45%(17 floors) destroying the intact <del>93%</del> 83% (92 floors).</p>

<p>According to NIST, WTC1 fell only 28% longer than pure free-fall:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The upper section of the building then collapsed onto the floors below, within <strong>12s</strong>, the collapse of WTC 1 had left nothing but rubble.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/wtc_draftreports.cfm">NIST file NCSTAR1 section 2.9</a></p>

<p>If it was free fall it would have been 9.32s without air resistance, meaning that <em>-according to NIST-</em> all floors provided a resistance that add up to 2.77s (12s - 9.32s).</p>

<p>Below the collapse area there were 95 floors.</p>

<p>2.77s / 95 floors = each floor being destroyed in <strong>0.029s</strong></p>

<p>29/<strong>1000ths</strong> of a second.</p>

<p>According to NIST, each floor -composed by concrete and steel- was being destroyed as fast as the impact between a stick and a cue ball.</p>

<p>Despite the top being only ~<strong>16%</strong> of the building (weaker and lighter), the result was still a perfect vertical gravity assisted downfall destruction of the remaining <del>93%</del> 83% perfectly intact structure (<em>stronger as well</em>) defying yet again another law of physics -Newton&#39;s third law- in which a smaller and weaker body cannot destroy a bigger and stronger body.</p>

<p>For example: for every floor of the <del>93%</del> 83% destroyed another floor of the 16% has to be destroyed. If Newton&#39;s third law had been respected, the building would be standing with ~75 floors, not 0.

<p>-------------------------TOWER SEVEN--------------------------------</p>

<p>Building 7 was hit by the debris <a href="http://i.imgur.com/wvNAAty.jpg">from one of the collapses</a> which caused fires and facade damage, one easily identified <a href="http://i.imgur.com/1E4Wrej.png">top to bottom gash.</a></p>

<p>Despite the presence of <a href="http://i.imgur.com/REuXNXp.jpg">large quantities of smoke,</a> there was never discovered any floor completely engulfed by fire, only partial fires and only on a few floors. The presence of<a href="http://i.imgur.com/LEeo3dH.jpg"> soot in the windows</a> are the indicator of <a href="http://i.imgur.com/OZ16WEX.jpg">fires that were already extinct.</a></p>

<p>The only fires that last long enough and could be responsible for the building to collapse were only on <a href="http://i.imgur.com/H25G67L.jpg">3 floors</a> and they were only partial small fires.</p>

<p>For a better comparison on the dimensions of WTC7&#39;s small office fires, here you have an example of <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RckrL1M.jpg">normal office fires</a> (or just plain office fires) and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KeOLtCQ.jpg">extreme office fires</a> (or <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8t40Tdw.jpg">infernos</a>).</p>

<p>By the time that the collapse initiated <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/news-section/41-articles/761-fraud-exposed-in-nist-wtc-7-reports-part-1.html">there were no more fires near the vicinity of the section that was appointed as the collapse failure initiation.</a> This means that the building started the collapse for a reason other than fire.</p>

<p>Despite public belief, the building did in fact collapse with sudden onset of free-fall (<em>18 visible stories in 3.9s</em>), there were no stages. A better explanation is provided below.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPwwcXF_V0c&amp;amp;t=4536">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPwwcXF_V0c&amp;amp;t=4536</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2011/07/11/video-analysis-of-nists-claim-of-a-5-4-s-collapse-time-over-18-stories-for-wtc-7/">http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2011/07/11/video-analysis-of-nists-claim-of-a-5-4-s-collapse-time-over-18-stories-for-wtc-7/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sharpprintinginc.com/911/index.php?module=pagemaster&amp;amp;PAGE_user_op=view_page&amp;amp;PAGE_id=207&amp;amp;MMN_position=616:616">http://www.sharpprintinginc.com/911/index.php?module=pagemaster&amp;amp;PAGE_user_op=view_page&amp;amp;PAGE_id=207&amp;amp;MMN_position=616:616</a></p>

<p>There was also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrnmbUDeHus">a loud explosion</a> that occurred right before the penthouse collapse. That explosion cannot possibly be from any structure &quot;snapping&quot; or &quot;failing&quot; because you would hear in that same video the rest of the building collapse as well, which you do not. If you cannot hear the entire building collapse then that explosion couldn&#39;t possibly be from a column failing.</p>

<p>In contrast with the WTC7 building, here you can see the other buildings that were hit with exponentially bigger forces (hit directly by the towers&#39; debris), some which under larger fires and did not globally collapse:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/IG6zNy9.png">WTC3</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ajG1Eln.jpg">WTC4</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/W7wPbQJ.jpg">WTC5</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/pN4Humj.jpg">WTC6</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/vSKVhSB.jpg">Deutsche bank building</a></p>

<p>And here are buildings that suffered extreme office fires and did not turn into a pile of ruble:</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/compare/fires.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/compare/fires.html</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>To end this list I would like to make a question which isn&#39;t meant to seek an answer but purely to make you ponder:</p>

<p>If you weren&#39;t aware of which buildings collapsed that day; Which one of these two buildings would you say turned into a pile of rubble: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/CXyRBH9.jpg">WTC5</a> or <a href="http://i.imgur.com/H25G67L.jpg">WTC7</a>?</p>

<p>PS: For any debunker that tries to answer/debunk the question even though I clearly stated that I am not looking for an answer but to make people ponder:</p>

<p>Remember that NIST has already stated that the structural damage was irrelevant and that the building would still have collapsed without any damage:<a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/21ubl5/people_trying_to_debunk_911/cggtw3u">http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/21ubl5/people_trying_to_debunk_911/cggtw3u</a>.</p>

<p>The argument of pointing out how much smoke there was on the other side is also irrelevant for 1 reason: smoke is not fire. For both pictures I only show the actual fires in both buildings and not the smoke coming out from either one.</p>

<hr/>

<p>A huge thanks to a former redditor for this comprehensive list.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Edit: after 8 hours, there are only two comments that question anything I&#39;ve posted. Let&#39;s see what the &#39;debunkers&#39; had to say:</p>

<p>A. Someone likened WTC1 and WTC2&#39;s controlled demolition to dominoes toppling over. I don&#39;t need to address this claim, as it is without merit.</p>

<p>B. Another person tried to prove that visual pictures of WTC7 having small, local office fires was false according to verbal testimony. Yet, with hundreds of cameras/camcorders pointing at the aftermath of that day (remember, WTC7 spent 7 extra hours being photographed before it was demolished), the poster can&#39;t provide one picture of their verbal proof, whereas I have shown, with <em>visual proof</em>, that there were only small, localized fires in WTC7.</p>

<p>&quot;The process was marred by &quot;serious flaws that call into question the capacity of the tribunal,&quot; Malcolm Stuart, director of Amnesty&#39;s Middle East and North Africa program, said. &quot;In particular, political interference undermined the independence and impartiality of the court.&quot; [61] The specific concerns raised by Amnesty International included the status of the trial as a &quot;Special Trial&quot; (unconstitutional according to the Iraqi Constitution), political interference in trial proceedings by the removal of a judge mid-trial, exclusion of members of the defense team at points in the trial, assassination of multiple members of the defence team, and the closure of the trial before the defence team had completed presenting its legal case.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee reacted guardedly to the death sentence, saying such verdicts should not appear to be &quot;victor&#39;s justice&quot; and should be acceptable to the people of Iraq and the international community. In a statement, he said &quot;such life and death decisions require credible due process of law.&quot;</p>

<p>etc. etc.</p>

<p>Like, what can you possibly even be suggesting with this? If the gov&#39;t wanted a coverup, I&#39;m pretty sure they could have convinced the FBI to updated Bin Laden&#39;s rap sheet!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point was that if the SITE video was enough evidence to charge bin laden with conspiracy, they would have done so. To hunt someone,  the fbi needs a warrant.  To get a warrant the court needs to see evidence. There was never a charge so there likely either want evidence or there wasn&#39;t evidence that they were comfortable examining.</p>

<p>But I never said anything about a government conspiracy. My point was that these videos that SITE keeps finding are clearly not considered admissable evidence.</p>

<p>&#39;Israel has announced it will pay university students to circulate pro-Israeli information on social media networks, without having to identify themselves as working for the government.</p>

<p>The move was publicised in a statement from Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#39;s office, the Associated Press reported. Students will receive scholarships to &quot;engage international audiences online&quot; and combat anti-Semitism and calls to boycott Israel, it was alleged.&#39;</p>

<p>Look where were at now with ISIS, a few months ago they were a faction group of Syrian rebels who were taking over towns in Iraq, now after a couple American beheadings and moving in on American oil interests they are all of a sudden a threat to homeland security.</p>

<p>Right I agree that the American people are sheeple being led to war by propaganda. If you look at every recent war it&#39;s clear that the ruling elites count on 80-90% of Americans being very, very stupid.</p>

<p>This is what I take issue with. Yes the beheadings were used to propagandize the war, however there were a number of videos that were being shared as well.  They do show what is allegedly ISIS just butchering people left and right.  This to me is the only legitimate reason there could be behind attacking them-to stop a genocide.  However I do find it very, very convenient how it just happened to be a Christian group who was threatened right before the announcement of the bombing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Almost every one of these things have been debunked (seriously, proving it is/isn&#39;t falling at &quot;free fall speed&quot; doesn&#39;t mean anything. Even if it was a controlled demolition it wouldn&#39;t fall at free fall speed. Same if it just collapsed.)</p>

<p>But I&#39;ll take to the 45 degree angle myth</p>

<p>Those happened during cleanup. <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LJyBuANVkQ4">video here</a>. The pylons they were working on were 55-60 tons. They were on unstable ground, and they needed to control the way the pylons fell. Instead of cutting straight across they made the cuts at a 45 degree angle to be sure they fell into the pit like they wanted. If they cut straight across and the rubble shifted that could knock it in a different direction and possibly kill workers down on the other side, or kill the cutters themselves.</p>

<p>Much of the &quot;thermite residue&quot; stuff is complete bs. People misidentified the residue from the cuts made during the cleanup, and other people who know nothing about what they are talking about said a lot of bullshit to support a thermite theory that never had legs to begin with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try to understand. With all that insulating material, you don&#39;t need large fires. You just need small fires, and fresh air can make its way down through small cracks quite easily.</p>

<p>Do you think a pottery kiln requires a heat source that&#39;s at 2400F? That&#39;s insane. It needs a heating element and lots of insulation. The heat energy is trapped and so it gets hotter and hotter. MUCH hotter than its heat source.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t know how the term &quot;office fire&quot; applies here (except obviously you want to make it sound like a pile of papers and upholstery or something). That building had gas lines under it, it had tons and tons of drywall, paint, wooden furniture, probably backup generators with massive diesel fuel tanks... there was no shortage of flammable materials in that rubble pile.</p>

<p>In terms of gas lines, wouldn&#39;t those be shut off? As for the drywall, paint, furniture, etc., why weren&#39;t they pulverized like most of the concrete and largely dispersed in the dust cloud?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also read that the thermal hot spots should have moved throughout the rubble as they used up available fuel sources, but temperature readings showed them staying in the same place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree. The idea is that a very powerful &quot;super&quot; thermite was used in the demolition of the building to cause it to fall, rather than it falling under its own weight after the planes hit. </p>

<p>It definitely is a hard idea to swallow, but the fact that they found those pools of metal, and they were still thousands of degrees in temp weeks after 9/11. That&#39;s what gives me pause, that and old videos taken in the 80&#39;s of the engineers of the building discussing how it was constructed to withstand a direct hit from a plane, if it ever were to occur.</p>

Oh, and then Obama&#39;s administration kicked that 30 day up to indefinite. So yeah, a permanent suspension of constitutional rights if you are deemed a &quot;threat to national security&quot;, the definition of which is entirely up to the government.

But there&#39;s more too, what about the multibillion dollar contracts for military spending, political careers, middle eastern power-shifting, perpetual commitment and presence in the middle east (we call it &quot;War on ISIS&quot; now)... and truly like dozens and dozens of other BIG shifts/investments/policy changes/procedures and political and military actions that are DIRECTLY the result of 9/11? NONE of the aforementioned would have been possible if the events of 9/11 hadn&#39;t happened. Snagging a harddrive and throwing it into a canyon somewhere would not have resulted in any of that shit. </p>

<p>Again, I am not even BROACHING the topic of &quot;conspiracy&quot; or controlled demolition or any of that. I am simply addressing your question about potential reasons/motives for this kind of action as opposed to just deleting some files. There is a LOT that happened because of buildings falling down, that would NOT have happened if a computer or two went missing. </p>

If they wanted to use it as some political reason to invade Iraq then wouldn&#39;t they <em>want</em> more people to know about it?

<p>Assumptions</p>

<p>This metric is meant to represent a model at equilibrium. Therefore it represents a snapshot of 51% of the incentive to miners at the current price and current transaction fee levels. The idea is that miners are willing to invest in the network as long as it is profitable to continue doing so. We assume the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rational Actors:We assume all mining participants are rational actors and strictly pursue profit maximization. We ignore all other motivations, including political, emotional, and reputational. All other heuristics and biases are ignored.</li>
<li><strong>Static Variables:We assume that the variables in the model are static, and therefore represent a &#39;snapshot in time&#39;. There are no growth forecasts for either price or transaction fees.</strong></li>
<li>Perfect Competition:We assume that all miners and potential attackers have access to the same technology, resources, and information. There is no technological advantage for any party that would exclusively decrease mining costs or otherwise acquire mining equipment faster.</li>

<p>&quot;We walked over by number Seven World Trade Center as it was burning and saw this 40-plus story building with fire on nearly all floors.&quot; - FDNY Lieutenant Robert Larocco</p>

<p>&quot;...Just when you thought it was over, you&#39;re walking by this building and you&#39;re hearing this building creak and fully involved in flames. It&#39;s like, is it coming down next? Sure enough, about a half an hour later it came down.&quot; - FDNY Lieutenant James McGlynn</p>

<p>&quot;walked out and I got to Vesey and West, where I reported to Frank [Cruthers]. He said, we’re moving the command post over this way, that building’s coming down. At this point, the fire was going virtually on every floor, heavy fire and smoke that really wasn’t bothering us when we were searching because it was being pushed southeast and we were a little bit west of that&quot; - FDNY Deputy Chief Nick Visconti</p>

<p>&quot;Then we had to move because the Duane Reade, they said, wasn&#39;t safe because building 7 was really roaring.&quot; - FDNY Chief Medical Officer Kerry Kelly</p>

<p>&quot;At this point Seven World Trade was going heavy, and they weren&#39;t letting anybody get too close. Everybody was expecting that to come down.&quot; - Firefighter Vincent Massa</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These comments still don&#39;t address how a steel framed building &quot;fully involved in flames&quot; would fall down due to fire. Up until that day, there were, as far as I&#39;m aware, no incidents of fire bringing down steel framed skyscrapers. </p>

<p>There are however a number of well documented cases of steel framed buildings of a similar construction to building 7 burning like raging infernos (check the images in the original post), sometimes for more than 24 hours, and remaining standing.</p>

<p>If fire was really a serious threat to steel framed skyscrapers you would expect a lot more incidents of collapse and a concerted effort by the international construction industry to develop &quot;fire proof&quot; steel. In fact you could argue it&#39;s EXACTLY steel&#39;s ability to withstand fire and remain structurally intact, that has lead to its adoption as the high-rise construction material of choice from Tokyo to Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>None of this official &quot;fire&quot; theory holds up. It&#39;s totally illogical.</p>

<p>Bringing the credibility of a public institution into question over their &quot;verbal&quot; testimony is simply a distraction away from the fundamental premise and flawed science at the heart of the building 7 &quot;fire collapse&quot; debate.</p>

Thank you so much for posting. Doesn&#39;t sound like much of a fire up top. I worked with plasma torches &amp; I could never understand how office/paper fire weakened anything to cause a collapse.

    <div class="md"><p>Who said they&#39;re lying? The whole fucking city was exploding as far as many were concerned, the world itself might have been on fire for many of the witnesses of 9/11. These were firefighters who were rushing to the scene of an airplane crashing into a tower full of people, knowing that hundreds of lives had already been lost and that thousands more were about to be lost if they couldn&#39;t act quickly enough. They were panicked just like any normal person would be, albeit with the training to try and remain calm, but this wasn&#39;t just some office fire or house fire, this was a motherfucking attack on our soil on a scale we&#39;d never experienced before. Who can blame them for getting some details wrong?</p>

<p>The other thing to note is that eyewitness testimony is historically inaccurate and flawed, mostly because people witnessing a terrifying event are viewing it through a lens of fear, but also because our memories as humans are often faulty.</p>

<p>This movie presents a mountain of evidence that implicates Israel and many non-Israeli Jews in 9/11 and other false flag operations.  Watching all of it will leave you with no doubt about who was responsible for 9/11.  However, even watching bits and pieces of this film is highly educational and recommended.</p>

<p>Sayanim
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>

<p>&quot;Sayanim is a term used to describe Jews living outside Israel as foreign citizens that volunteer to provide assistance to the Mossad. This assistance includes facilitating medical care, money, logistics, and even overt intelligence gathering, yet sayanim are only paid for their expenses. No official number is known, but estimates put the number of sayanim in the thousands. The existence of this large body of volunteers is one reason why the Mossad operates with fewer case officers than fellow intelligence agencies. Ostrovsky&#39;s claims have not been verified from other sources.&quot;</p>

<p>1) Why the fuck did building 7 fall!? </p>

<p>2) Where the hell is all the wreckage from the crash in that Pennsylvania field!? Where&#39;s all the plane debris from the Pentagon hit!?  Planes my ass.  Soft soil my ass. Give me a break. The Commission said that the field&#39;s soil was &quot;soft&quot; so when the planes hit the ground they sunk in like quicksand/jelly... oh man, I hate it when the gov&#39;t thinks we&#39;re that stupid.  The phone video showed MH17 in Ukraine going into a nosedive.  It didn&#39;t sink into the ground. Is Pennsylvania ground that special?  For fuck sakes... </p>

<p>3) Why did the Bulgarian embassy staff (as well as other offices/people) told not to show up for work that morning? </p>

<p>4) Pristine unburnt passports that supposedly belonged to the terrorists were found at the Pennsylvania crash?  Oh come on! </p>

<p>Anyways, I&#39;d like to thank the OP for posting about those phone calls. I had no idea about them. A call lasting more than 45 minutes <strong>AFTER</strong> the crash?  Wow, the gov&#39;t must think we&#39;re really stupid... </p>

<p>1) Why the fuck did building 7 fall!?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After just a 5 second google search punching in your questions, I came up with <a href="http://www.debunking911.com/pull.htm">this</a>.</p>

<p>From the website:</p>

<p><em>&quot;Conspiracy theorists say World Trade Center 7 is the best proof for controlled demolition because it wasn&#39;t hit by airliners and only had a few fires. They also claim that there was a confession from the building owner who said he &quot;pulled&quot; it. But this is deceptive because while building 7 wasn&#39;t hit by an airliner, it was hit by the large perimeter columns of the Tower collapse. It was 400 ft away but the towers were more than 1300 ft tall. As the tower peeled open, it easily tilted over to reach building 7. Below is evidence showing that conspiracy theorists are wrong.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>He then proceeds to go into sourced and fairly detailed arguments refuting the popular theories.</p>

<p>Honestly people, just do 2 seconds of research on the opposing side.</p>

No one&#39;s here for your entertainment for &quot;rebuttal&quot;. You fucking coward. Do some actual research, instead of listening to your own ego. Guys like you need to suffer more in life in order to see the truth. You&#39;re probably a keyboard desk jockey passing time by trying to be funny.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not anything.  I&#39;m just trying to make sense of what is a fact and what isn&#39;t.  I have watched <em>Loose Change</em> and read lots of 9/11-related stuff, but I don&#39;t ever recall hearing anything about the Bulgarian Embassy before.  I&#39;m not here to troll, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking.</p>

<p>Are you referring to the Bulgarian embassy in New York City or are you referring to the US embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria?  I&#39;m assuming that you mean the first.</p>

<p>I did see that both 6 Sep and 22 Sep 2001 were Bulgarian national holidays, so I could see the embassy being closed on those days.</p>

<p>If you have any source for that info, I&#39;d be interested.  Maybe it&#39;s real, or maybe it&#39;s a rumor like Jews being told not to go to work that day.</p>

<p>I did find this in the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/ten-years-ago-today-countdown-911/story?id=14191671#all">ABC timeline of 9/11</a>.  But there&#39;s no mention of how long they were closed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>August 30, 2001:  The State Department announces that American embassies in Bulgaria and Romania will be temporarily closed because of an unspecified terror threat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.state.gov/dpbarchive/2001/4752.htm">Here</a> is the US State Department briefing on it.</p>

<p>As far as I can determine, they were only closed that one day, 30 August 2001.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see. Thanks.  No further source information I can provide you with.  I know I read stuff like certain companies/organizations went to work as usually that day, with loved ones saying that their partner/spouse acted normal, whereas (as Loose Change mentioned) some offices were closed that day (possibly due to FEMA exercises happening that day too?).  Who knows...</p>

<p>Anyways, I&#39;m more of an observer, keeping an open mind about things, and then discern what&#39;s plausible, what&#39;s real (at least in my mind with sound facts), and what&#39;s just outright stupid.  </p>

<p>Cheney authorized shootdowns AFTER flight 93 was down. And even though it&#39;s pretty obvious that the information about multiple shootdowns already having happened is just wrong, this gets interpreted as &quot;proof they shot down 93&quot;. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>What the hell is with conspiracy theorists and your cryptic threatening bullshit. I love the vague, dark shit you guys type to make it sound like what you&#39;re saying has weight and importance. Believing that flight 93 wasn&#39;t fucking blown up doesn&#39;t make me subject to the big government take-down that you believe is <em>obviously</em> gonna happen and you&#39;ll be the heroes who warned us before it was too late. Not everything is some fucking shadow organization trying to take over the world. You don&#39;t need pictures of fucking bodies to prove people died, for fuck&#39;s sake why would they take pictures before fucking <em>checking the wreckage for survivors and checking the bodies for vital signs.</em> and you don&#39;t need the <em>perfect</em> images of a plane crash to prove it&#39;s a crash and that it didn&#39;t blow up. I&#39;m fine arguing points, but it&#39;s the apocryphal, cryptic bullshit that you guys spout like what you just wrote is what fucking annoys me to no end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really, it&#39;s mostly to wake sheeple up to start thinking for themselves.  We might be wrong about a specific occurrence, but I doubt we&#39;re wrong about everything.  Shortly after 9/11 the US went to war with Iraq(again).  Can you answer why?  It was Osama that funded the attack right?  Bush Sr. wasn&#39;t the one that started the Gulf War just 10 years prior?</p>

<p>Afterwards the PATRIOT act was put into place where more of our rights were stripped from us, and the government has the power to kidnap anyone they want on suspicion and just classify it as terrorism.</p>

<p>The government is not looking out for the people, they&#39;re looking out for their own wealth.  They will try to perpetuate any war they can to continue the military industrial complex, if they don&#39;t have a reason to go to war with the unlucky country, well, they&#39;ll just make one to get the people to jump onboard.</p>

<p>If the US really cared about human rights/justice they would do something about Israel/Palestine.</p>

<p>Like was stated, the US has not fought in a defensive war in 70 years.  To the countries we invade, we are the terrorists.  It&#39;s all a matter of perspective.  </p>

<p>The government does not have the wealth. They are puppets of the ones in control. Read The Economic Hitman to understand how those in charge are coerced. The US government is no different. Their choice is clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hitler burned the Reichstag and set up a Dutch communist with learning difficulties (Marinus van der Lubbe) as the fall guy.  He was found guilty and guillotined in Leipzig prison.  The Gulf of Tonkin incident was reported the way the American government wanted to report it.</p>

<p>Both of these are a long way from coordinating four plane hijacks and causing the destruction of two landmark buildings in the busiest city in the world, destroying a third building in the same complex and also hitting the Pentagon, all with the world watching on 24 hour news channels and the internet.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re saying 9/11 was an inside job then there were way more moving parts, a much greater margin for error and the need for hundreds if not thousands of complicit actors and a greater number of tacit actors than in either the Reichstag fire or the Gulf of Tonkin incident. </p>

<p>I have no trouble with believing just about any government would sacrifice a few thousand of its own citizens if the cost benefit analysis recommended it but that still doesn&#39;t mean 9/11 was an inside job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They had flight training.  Alarm bells were raised when they didn&#39;t seem interested in the take off and landing procedures.  That was what led to  FBI agent Harry Samit being tipped off about Zaccarias Moussaoui (sp?)</p>

<p>I also believe they could have taken over the planes with box cutters.  These were fanatics so cutting up a few air crew members would not have been a problem for them and since pre 9/11, there had never been anything like 9/11, the passengers would have assumed that these were standard hijackings and they should do as they were told.  (Look what happened to Richard Reid and Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab when they tried to set off explosives in shoes and underwear post 9/11.)</p>

<p>If this was a false flag attack, I find it harder to believe that something so complex and intricate with so many moving parts and so many necessary personnel could have been conceived, planned and pulled off in broad daylight and somehow there have been no drunken or deathbed confessions of involvement or foreknowledge from any of the participants.  This is the Federal govt.  They just aren&#39;t that good at their jobs.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know whether you subscribe to MIHOP or LIHOP but if it&#39;s MIHOP then even if this was hypothetically put forward in some darkened conference room as a plan, I can&#39;t see it ever getting past the &#39;back of an envelope&#39; stage because of all the things that could potentially go wrong and expose the plotters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright.  Well, it&#39;s really just the stunning success of the thing that blows my mind.  I mean, they hit both buildings in just the absolutely perfect way to make them collapse.  And then, the debris from the buildings fell in just the perfect way to strike fires in building 7, which (according to NIST) caused the floors to expand in the perfect way to cause the first-ever fire-induced progressive collapse of a steel structure.  Also, a student pilot rated as &quot;poor&quot; by his instructors managed to fly a 757 just a few feet above the ground at full speed-- a feat called &quot;nearly impossible&quot; by many commercial pilots.  It would be much more difficult to do that than to land the airplane.</p>

<p>So much went so right for those hijackers, if the official conspiracy theory is true, that it rises to the level of &quot;extraordinary evidence&quot; for the existence of Allah.</p>

<p>Have you read the NIST report on building 7?  It states that if the building had been brought down by a explosives, it would have to have made a sound of 130 to 140 dB from a half-mile away.  It gives no explanation for why it would have had to be so loud, or what materials they were supposing had been used, or why other, quieter materials couldn&#39;t have been used.  They completely ignore multiple newscasts of explosions prior to collapse, and they ignore many eyewitnesses.  This is their excuse for not even looking into the possibility that explosions brought down the building.  They don&#39;t explain why building 7 is the only steel structure ever to collapse from floor expansion.  They didn&#39;t even look at any physical evidence.</p>

<p>Reading <a href="http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/factsheet/wtc_qa_082108.cfm">this report</a>, it seems more plausible that Allah pushed the building down than what they say happened.</p>

<p>So, if the official conspiracy theory is true, we should all probably convert to Islam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, haven&#39;t read the NIST report as sciences and physics are not my expertise.  I wouldn&#39;t know enough to comment authoritatively on the various pro and con arguments.  I know a lot of people looked at the footage of building 7 collapsing and said it &#39;looked&#39; like a demolition and they &#39;thought&#39; they heard explosions but that&#39;s not proof in and of itself.  How many of these people are experts in commercial or military demolitions or structural engineers who can give an informed opinion?</p>

<p>Remember that documentary those two French guys made of firefighters who went into the WTC on 9/11?  There&#39;s a harrowing part where they are in the lobby and they can hear the jumpers from the upper floor impacting.  If they hadn&#39;t said what those noises were, I&#39;d never have known that&#39;s what I was hearing hence I am unconvinced by witnesses use a frame of reference to say what they heard/saw.</p>

<p>I am a student of history and politics though and find it interesting to see how governments act through third parties (eg stories of Hamid Karzai being a CIA contractor back in the 70s/80s) as well as how &#39;false flag&#39; operations were run in the past to justify Hitler becoming Fuhrer, Japan&#39;s invasion of Manchuria etc so we know these things absolutely happen.  These were singular events though - an act of arson, an attack on a train and so on.</p>

<p>We know Bush had Iraq in his sights from day one so if they wanted a false flag op to get the nation/world behind that, why go to all this trouble and then have the hijackers be largely Saudis - a nation allied to the Bush administration&#39;s interests?  Why not frame Iraqis?  Why do something which means you end up in Afghanistan as well chasing Bin Laden?  That&#39;s why it doesn&#39;t scan to me - it was an incredibly complex set of moving parts requiring a cast of thousands but what exactly was the initial goal from inception?</p>

<p>As for WTC 7, I can see the symbolic impact of crashing into the Twin Towers but what is the supposed rationale for bringing down building 7?  I&#39;ve read some arguments about there being a CIA office in building 7 so it had to be brought down to cover up the evidence of a conspiracy but that doesn&#39;t make sense so presumably there are other motives assigned for this.</p>

<p>I&#39;m certainly not going to propose any alternative conspiracy theories, or attempt to explain the motives of people I don&#39;t know who may or may not have had any involvement in the actual conspiracy.  My point is only to say that the official conspiracy theory is something like saying a guy who has never picked up a cue stick in his life shot his first break and sent every single ball into a pocket.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link again. I read that factsheet but I still can&#39;t find any reasonable motive ascribed for bringing down WTC7.  I don&#39;t think it was a demolition though.  You can see on the footage that a penthouse or roof structure collapses first and then the rest of the building falls a few seconds later.  I&#39;m no expert but I looked up some footage of controlled demolitions and they were much noisier too.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take one aspect of the conspiracies attached to 9/11 - that the Pentagon was hit by a missile.  If you follow that then you have a plane full of crew and passengers being diverted elsewhere and then the plane the crew and the passengers being disposed of and never seen again.  At the same time, a missile was fired at the Pentagon and a cast of actors and prop people assembled to sprinkle pieces of aircraft wreckage around the grounds for the media to see.  Ignoring the WTC strikes, the planning and personnel and resources required for this aspect of the operation alone and to keep it quiet is massive.  </p>

<p>Is that explanation really more plausible than the idea that a hijacked plane hit the Pentagon?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, NIST wouldn&#39;t be involved in an investigation of motives.  What I found most interesting about the factsheet was that they stated that structural damage did not contribute to the collapse, nor did the heat of the fires.  They said that collapse occurred due to expansion of the steel flooring, even though similar buildings (which they listed) burned longer and did not collapse.  They didn&#39;t even have any major recommendations on improving existing buildings to prevent collapses in the future (aside from improving insulation requirements, which were already good enough to prevent collapse from office fires in all buildings, world-wide prior to building 7).  It was, basically, a freak occurrence, according to NIST.  It&#39;s literally as if Allah himself pushed the building down.</p>

<p>I know any explanation other than the official conspiracy theory presents enormous challenges.  But who is better-qualified to meet the challenges of such an act?  The entire US government secret operations infrastructure, or 19 dudes from Saudi Arabia with minimal training?</p>

<p>It&#39;s like Morgan Freeman&#39;s character says in the Batman movie, when confronted by a blackmailer: you think this guy does all this horrible, violent shit...and your plan is to challenge him?</p>

<p>I know, for me, if I had any intimate knowledge of these kinds of secrets about people who did these kinds of things, I would keep my damn mouth shut.  I wouldn&#39;t risk my family&#39;s safety just so I could be branded a lunatic and dismissed by virtually everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can buy a freak occurence more than a controlled demolition.  A lot of unprecedented things happened that day.  I can&#39;t give you much more than that because I am not clued up enough on physics, architecture to give an informed view.</p>

<p>Again, if it was brought down as part of a conspiracy, what was the reason?  Who put the explosives into WTC7?  How long would it take to rig a building of that size and could you do it without anyone who works there day to day noticing?  No one died in WTC7 so there would be hundreds or thousands of people able to testify about unusual activity in the weeks leading up to 9/11.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The entire US government secret operations infrastructure, or 19 dudes from Saudi Arabia with minimal training?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That right there is what makes me think it was 19 guys plus whatever planning and logisitics was supplied by KSM&#39;s group.  You said, &#39;entire&#39; secret operations infrastructure.  Even with a smaller group, do you really think there would be no-one who balked at the idea of killing 4,000 people on American soil and lying to the world?</p>

<p>Government employees (in any country) are just not that good at their jobs and rubbish at keeping their mouths shuts.  Every new person who has to be brought into the loop is a potential leak.  We&#39;re talking thousands of people who were willing to go along with this and keep their mouths shut.  </p>

<p>No-one was approached and declined to participate?  No-one who did participate ever had an attack of conscience or spilled the beans whilst drunk or made a deathbed confession?</p>

<p>You also need all emergency responders to conveniently ignore anything they see that makes what happened look like anything other than the official story.  Look how many NYFD guys died at the WTC?  Surely they would be screaming from the roof tops if they had any knowledge that contravened the official story.</p>

<p>My problem is that the conspiracy theories seemed designed to fill in the gaps/anomalies but if you take the theories then you have to discard a lot of the accepted version of events and construct an even more outlandish set of conditions to make those theories work.  </p>

<p>The government does have a case to answer - their job was to protect the country from all enemies both foreign and domestic and by any stretch 9/11 represents a catastrophic failure of duty and many fingers have been pointed at the CIA (especially by the FBI) for dropping the ball with regard to monitoring active AQ cell members and not sharing their intelligence.  </p>

<p>I think ultimately we each have our views here and we aren&#39;t going to change each other&#39;s minds. In any case it has been good to have a civilised discussion and not get called a Zionist shill or disinfo agent. :)</p>

<p>Have a good one!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re asking me to defend some stance, but I don&#39;t know what happened.  I have no theory.  I do know bullshit when I smell it, though.  The idea that 19 Saudis with minimal training managed to simultaneously hi-jack 4 airplanes, crash 3 of them successfully into their targets, and crash two of them in such a way that they not only completely destroyed their target skyscrapers, but also took out another skyscraper a block away through some freak occurrence that has never happened before and will never happen again is 100% bullshit.</p>

<p>Anyone who even thinks about it for a second would know on the face of it that it is utter nonsense.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe the people who defend the official conspiracy theory are shills.  The first rule of business is to protect your investment.  Most people invest a great deal of faith into the idea that the people who make it to the very top levels of our government and the people who work for them, doing stuff that we will never, ever know about, are basically good, responsible, unselfish people who would never betray our trust.  We depend upon that notion for our sense of hope in our lives.  Of course, when some joker comes along, telling you that all this faith and hope of yours is poorly invested, you&#39;re going to get defensive about it.  Believe me, I know.  I spent years defending the official story.  I had a lot at stake.  I was a Soldier for 10 years, and I did two deployments in Iraq.  I hate to think that the people who sent us over there were anything less than saints and geniuses.  However, when I tell the story in the simplest possible terms and try my best to hear it as if I had never heard it before, it just seems too obvious to me.  It&#39;s bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well we are on the same page there regarding governments.  I think if they decided the best way to achieve a goal was to lose a few thousand civilians they&#39;d do it.  It&#39;s a widely held belief in the UK that the Allies knew the Luftwaffe were going to bomb the English city of Coventry in WW2 because they&#39;d cracked the Enigma code.  They had two choices - evacuate Coventry and potentially let the Germans see they&#39;d broken their codes or let Coventry burn and preserve a potentially war winning advantage.  Coventry burned.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t trust someone like Dick Cheney or Tony Blair to tell me the right time (UK redditor BTW).  Can&#39;t speak for Bush as he always seemed like Cheney&#39;s puppet unfortunately.  These men lied about WMDs and the imminent threat Saddam posed and they were found out and that will be their legacy.  Blair&#39;s reputation couldn&#39;t get any lower over here.  Could they be found out over that but manage to keep their involvement in a much larger conspiracy secret?</p>

<p>I just think in this case there were far too many moving parts.  You were a soldier and I am sure you had officers and colleagues who were nailed on professionals as well as those who couldn&#39;t find their arses with both hands shoved down their trousers.  My experience of large bureaucracies is that they are hopelessly inefficient and indiscreet so everything needed to orchestrate 9/11 couldn&#39;t have been kept quiet that easily. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know that the hijackers expected the Towers to fall.  I think they just planned to hit them.  It was a symbolic strike.  The fact they fell was a bonus for them.  They took advantage of non-existent security on America&#39;s internal flights to hijack the plane and then did something unprecedented which was a one off.  If anyone even looks shifty on a plane now the rest of the passengers flatten them.</p>

<p>I understand now that you aren&#39;t proposing another theory but you don&#39;t like the official story.  However if the official story is a lie then someone must have an idea of what the truth is and have a cogent analysis with a conclusion that points to a more plausible explanation and I haven&#39;t seen one to date that explains why WTC7 was brought down.  WTC5 was also sufficiently damaged and needed pulling down but that one doesn&#39;t seem to get much attention.</p>

<p>Thanks for the heads up on the NYFD retiree.  I&#39;ll look out for that thread.  However, one guy is a statistically insignificant sample size.  It&#39;s a bit like the AE911truth group.  There&#39;s 2,000 of them which sounds impressive until you realise how many registered architects and engineers there are in the USA alone (I did the numbers a few years back when I started to look at this a few years ago and it&#39;s a pretty small sample).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So offer a plausible explanation or motive for bringing down the building and I&#39;ll happily take a look at it.</p>

<p>Nothing wrong with saying the argument doesn&#39;t make sense.  If the argument there were incriminating files in the building then demolishing the building doesn&#39;t make sense when you can shred and burn paper or use magnets, microwaves or even hammers to destroy hard drives.</p>

<p>Demolishing the building creates a scenario where the destruction of evidence is a circumstantial accident, an act of God. Destroying evidence in any of the ways you just listed would be perceived as just that, destroying evidence, and would raise the appropriate questions among the public. That&#39;s one extremely obvious distinction between the two scenarios which I hesitate to believe that you ignored willingly. You&#39;re just being a contrarian, the question is, why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically I am just thinking it through and it doesn&#39;t scan.</p>

<p>If you think 7 was a controlled demolition then there has to be a motive.  So people looked at the building occupants and saw one floor had govt offices including a CIA office and concluded 7 was brought down to hide evidence. Really?  </p>

<p>If there was evidence to hide, they could have been shredding away and smashing hard drives everyday and we would never have known.  It&#39;s what public and private sector offices do everyday - shred old files, recycle drives etc.  </p>

<p>So assuming this damning evidence existed and was in the building down the road from the twin towers, you still have the logistical problem of rigging a building for demolition while it&#39;s in use and having those explosives remain stable despite fires raging on various floors for several hours.  </p>

<p>It just isn&#39;t a plausible explanation.</p>

<p>It is an absolute must watch and by far the best 911 documentary available.</p>

<p>September 10, 2001: Donald Rumsfeld reports $2.3 trillion missing from the Pentagon.  All evidence related to this was destroyed in the attack on the Pentagon.</p>

<p>Also, all evidence related to the ENRON scandal was destroyed in WTC 7.  </p>

<p>Those are just a couple reasons.  There were so many reasons, from the insurance pay-off to the wars that put Iraqi oil back in petro-dollars and revived the global opium trade.  They did an extraordinary job saving as many people as they could.  Normally, you&#39;d expect anywhere from 30k to 50k people to be in those buildings at the time of the attacks.  </p>

<p>Why don&#39;t any of the thousands of people who had to have been involved in this come out?</p>

<p>Some have, and died.</p>

<p>But, really...If you were complicit with a government that killed 3,000 of its own people...Would you stick your neck out and say anything?  Would you risk the lives of your family just so you could be called a lunatic and dismissed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I usually get recommendations to watch this or that movie so I googled her and the first hit was that she had been debunked by Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth but aren&#39;t those were the guys who proposed the controlled demolitions theory in the first place?  Does this mean there&#39;s two factions of conspiracy theorists who oppose each other?  </p>

<p>I just had a few points I wanted to raise as a starting point with someone who believes a controlled demolition brought down WTC7.  I can post them if you like.  You might have valid counter points anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>  OK she appears believes in some kind of invisible free energy beams brought down the Towers so she&#39;s not likely to have much to say about controlled demolitions with explosives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks but I wanted to talk to someone who believes explosives were used to bring down Building 7 in a controlled demolition.  </p>

<p>In any case I looked this woman up and she&#39;s getting slammed by debunkers and truthers so I don&#39;t think I need to watch this documentary.</p>

<p>In the interests of balance I looked up the Hutchison effect and it was tough to find anything that wasn&#39;t a conspiracy theorist or debunking site.  The broad facts appear to be that John Hutchison (who has no formal scientific background) claimed to have produced all sorts of incredible effects in his apartment using surplus military equipment but neither he nor anyone else has been able to replicate these effects.  He released some footage of his experiments which was later admitted to be fake.</p>

<p>Since you are a proponent of this effect I assume you know all this and I&#39;m not sure why you would think this is the most plausible explanation.  Unless you&#39;re just pulling my leg of course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup a smaller and weaker body cannot possibly destroy a larger and stronger body. That&#39;s exactly why a soft lead bullet has never ever penetrated hard steel before... Oh wait. You seriously have no understanding beyond a 10th grade level of physics. Try this for a thought (or physical would be fine too) experiment: hold a bowling ball at arms&#39; length above your chest. Then let go of the bowling ball from the same height and tell me if you feel any difference in applied force. But no, must violate Newton&#39;s third law right? Your bogus application of Newton&#39;s first law is even more offensive to my sensibilities... Because if gravity acts downwards, why would the floors tend to fall downwards? Fuck me, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A building is not a solid block, it&#39;s a composition of it&#39;s parts that are strongly bounded together, but nonetheless start behaving in ways that may seem erratic, at a glance at least, at failure.</p>

<p>Consider an apartment building that&#39;s had a couple of it&#39;s support beams knocked out on, say, the second highest floor in the building. Even supposing all the other beams were not affected by whatever it was that knocked these beams out, they are now supporting, each of them, a fraction of the load that the missing beams were. What&#39;s worse than this is that the few support columns nearest to the missing ones are supporting more weight than the others, so the sudden increase in load is not evenly distributed either.</p>

<p>Everything that&#39;s built or manufactured that could potentially injure people is made with certain safety factors in mind, but this is also balanced by cost effectiveness. So you may have a support beam capable of supporting 1.3 x it&#39;s expected load, say, but maybe not twice as much as it can reasonably be expected to bear because that&#39;s unnecessarily costly. So when these beams are removed, you risk having these beams start to fail too.</p>

<p>More likely though, and for similar reasons, the floor above these beams will start to fail as the beams start pushing through them. This is because the floor has effectively increased it&#39;s force with regards to how that weight is distributed across the beams.</p>

<p>So now you have a floor that&#39;s being punctured below by support beams which are dealing with an increased weight. Of course, once the floor starts to break apart, like any solid material that has a portion of it cut out, the integrity of the whole floor becomes diminished. That is to say, it&#39;s more likely to start cracking and coming apart since it&#39;s already experienced the beginning of failure. Eventually the floor collapses.</p>

<p>Now you may think that this is the weight of one floor of a building falling onto the rest of a sturdy structure, but it&#39;s not. Not really. It&#39;s the weight of this floor suddenly added to the weight of the floor below it. There is no whole building, really, to think of. When failure in a machine or structure occurs, just a small change can have very quick and very dramatic effects if they are outside of the scope of that structures normal conditions, the ones it was designed for.</p>

<p>So you have the floor below not only doubling it&#39;s load, but also taking the brunt of collision force which effectively increases it&#39;s weight hugely (in that weight is just a force, and this is compounded by the acceleration given by gravity). It&#39;s also, again, very possibly going to be uneven in some substantial way.</p>

<p>Once one floor falls in a building, it is not unfathomable at all to imagine the rest below it coming down also. At least for several stories, but it can be critical by no stretch of the imagination, and these floors that are falling can additionally and conceivably knock out other support beams on their way down as well, which would increase the scope of the catastrophe.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a really interesting documentary on the Sampoong Department Store collapse that goes into this pretty well. I can&#39;t remember the name of it, but it&#39;s accessible, and you may find it interesting too if you have time for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, thank you for taking up the mantle and engaging in a debate with me. Let&#39;s work this through and figure out who we can decide is correct.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to address your first point, not because I don&#39;t think it could have merit, but you&#39;ll have to be more specific. My hypothesis is that a building can collapse if a few support beams are removed. You&#39;ll have to explain to me why you think this violates conservation of momentum.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why you think a pancake collapse is not possible. I mean, you know the term, so you must know there&#39;s some precedent for this type of failure. And you&#39;re also not really explaining how whatever it is you&#39;re trying to say has been proven false has been proven false, so I suppose I&#39;m supposed to take your word on it?</p>

<p>If you have part of an upper floor collapsing in a building, it doesn&#39;t have to all fall symmetrically to cause a straight down collapse, since this progressive type of failure, at no point during it&#39;s failure, is likely to be heavy enough to affect the moment at the base of the building substantially enough to have it tip over. This isn&#39;t Jenga, everything is going to be crumpling and breaking apart on the way down. You can&#39;t imagine it as the floor that&#39;s collapsing to be falling down slanted (which I can only imagine as the way you&#39;re seeing it), thus causing all the building above it to be tipped slightly in one direction. Once failure starts occurring, the increased stresses that result from it are going to cause the pieces, the jenga blocks themselves, to start breaking apart. It isn&#39;t this idea that violates any concept of conserving momentum, but the idea that a building would start moving, as a whole, and rotating at some point to tip over before it&#39;s internal components started to fail.</p>

<p>&quot;Impossible&quot;, &quot;ludicrous&quot;, &quot;invalid&quot;; these are the words of someone arguing who doesn&#39;t know how to make their point. A lot can happen in structural failure, and indeed we have seen whole buildings collapse straight downward, without planned detonation, that are not being contested. To imply that this idea is so absolutely ludicrous that it doesn&#39;t merit further explanation neglects a very basic knowledge of the history of these failures, if nothing else.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll have to explain to me why you think this violates conservation of momentum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is very basic science, it is one of the most powerful laws in physics and you want me to explain how it applies to everyday objects?</p>

<p>This does not bode well for any sort of meaningful discussion, but here you go...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The law of momentum conservation can be stated as follows. For a collision occurring between object 1 and object 2 in an isolated system, the total momentum of the two objects before the collision is equal to the total momentum of the two objects after the collision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Newton&#39;s Third Law states that the interaction forces are equal and opposite.  In a collision between two objects (the top of the building alleged to have crushed the rest of the structure) both objects experience forces that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Such forces often cause one object to speed up (gain momentum) and the other object to slow down (lose momentum)</p>

<p>To really dumb this down for you, the impact of the falling <em>block</em> could never destroy the lower section of the healthy building, it certainly could not destroy the building, maintaining a constant acceleration.</p>

<p>It does not make any sense in science and is the reason why it has NEVER been officially explained.</p>

<p>If you disagree with this, please provide me a source.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean, you know the term, so you must know there&#39;s some precedent for this type of failure</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know the term, NIST even tried to use it at one point, they dismissed the idea, so have truthers.</p>

<p>So you will need to give me a source for this precedent in a steel framed building, not a concrete reinforced building.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and indeed we have seen whole buildings collapse straight downward, without planned detonation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source? for a steel framed building, not a concrete reinforced building.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To imply that this idea is so absolutely ludicrous that it doesn&#39;t merit further explanation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that it has happened only three times in history, all three on 9/11 and that there is no evidence for what you are saying, i would say that is pretty ludicrous.</p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t the official investigation investigate HOW all three buildings collapsed, instead of stopping at the initiation of collapse, again, this is not how  severe structural failures are investigated and is the reason why a new independent investigation is needed.</p>

<p>I will wait for these sources</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, if you&#39;re going to put me down for asking a question, you should probably make sure that you&#39;re explanation is pretty air tight.</p>

<p>First, I didn&#39;t ask what the conservation of momentum is, I asked what in my argument you felt violated this concept, which you did not make clear at the outset.</p>

<p>Second, the fact that you believe a collapsing building can be assessed as two objects (the portions of the building above and below the point of failure) when applying your belief in this law is not just misguided, but wildly inappropriate. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The conservation of momentum does not negate the effects of gravity. Momentum can be increased in a body if that body is subjected to the acceleration caused by falling. It&#39;s why we have the concept of potential energy, and why your argument is flawed right from the start.</p></li>
<li><p>The smaller body was not falling on a larger body. Heavy parts of a structure were falling and causing failure in other parts of that structure. It is possible to oversimplify a concept to a point where the physics of the actual scenario don&#39;t fit your conceived model, and the idea that the bottom of this building failed as one single block is observably untrue and theoretically inconceivable.</p></li>
<li><p>While the upper part of a building could not destroy the lower part by weight alone all at once, it can, very realistically, continue to destroy floors below it, compounding both it&#39;s weight and velocity on the way down. If you think eventually these floors will get slowed down because momentum must be conserved, you really have no clue how that law is applied, and how it doesn&#39;t work with an object that has a constant acceleration, like, I don&#39;t know, gravity, applied to it.</p></li>
<li><p>Do you know why skyscrapers are made with steel instead of concrete? Because steel is lighter while being able to support more. The reason this is necessary is because the skyscraper would otherwise collapse under it&#39;s own weight or have to be built pyramid shaped. This should clue you into the idea that skyscrapers are still very much fighting a constant battle of collapsing under their own weight, and a small trauma can in fact cause a huge issue. Why does it matter if a building you see collapse is primarily steel or concrete? Do you think steel benefits from some special laws of physics that exempt it from failure?</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact that it has happened only three times in history, all three on 9/11 and that there is no evidence for what you are saying, i would say that is pretty ludicrous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wish I could address these statements, but they are once again, too vague. The fact that it has happened only three times in history? What is &#39;it&#39;, exactly? The collapse of buildings? And what am I saying that requires evidence, also? I&#39;d be happy to provide whatever it is I&#39;m capable of, so long as you point it out in my argument.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why you believe the investigation wasn&#39;t thorough enough, but I would say that the planes flying into the building is a pretty good indication of a causal factor, but I otherwise agree. Of course a thorough investigation should have been involved, I&#39;m just not sure that it wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>EDIT: Here is your <a href="http://www.physlink.com/education/askexperts/ae602.cfm">source</a> for why I disagree with you. From the physics forum:</p>

<p>&quot;But as is observed in the question, there are many times where momentum is apparently <em>not</em> conserved. I can name two more obvious cases, with less &quot;complication&quot; (i.e. rolling): A ball drops from a height, and gains momentum. A ball of putty strikes a wall, sticks and stops. These all apparently violate conservation of momentum.</p>

<p>However, these problems are all apparent. Momentum is conserved only for a closed system. In all these cases, there are external forces. But, we should also be able to find where the momentum went. It turns out, in all these cases, the body which needs to be included to let momentum be conserved is the earth. When a body drops from a height, it gains momentum down, while the earth gains the same momentum up. Since the earth is very massive, you can not observe its motion in reaction. Same goes for a ball rolling downhill. And, in the case of putty ball hitting the wall and stopping, the momentum is passed onto the earth, which is again, not observable.&quot;</p>

<p>Do you want me to grab this out of a textbook as well, or are you fine with this explanation?</p>

<p>I&#39;m confused. Do you want me to start sourcing physics textbooks? And I mean that really, because I will if you want me to. You know that gravity is just a form of acceleration, I mean you&#39;ve hinted at that knowledge in your other post. You must know that velocity increases as a constant acceleration is applied to something, unless you don&#39;t know what acceleration is. You must also know that as one floor is suddenly added to another floor that the weight on that first floor increases. What is it exactly you need a source for?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sorce that a small trauma can cause a huge issue, in a steel framed skyscraper</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, why does it matter that it&#39;s steel framed? Steel is stronger, it doesn&#39;t have any magical, physics defying properties. I&#39;m going to answer this comment along with the comment saying that only three times in history have we seen skyscrapers collapse due to fire. I am fairly confident that the number of skyscrapers being hit by commercial airliners is also fairly low. If you want to know why we don&#39;t see it more often, it&#39;s because skyscrapers are designed with safety provisions for small office fires, but not for huge fucking jets flying in the windows. If you want to know why that makes a difference, it&#39;s because fires burn at different temperatures. There is no universal temperature for all fires. Different material has different ignition points, but if you exceed that ignition temperature, that shit is still very much going to ignite.</p>

<p>If you want sources on how fire can burn at different temperatures, I can provide those, on request.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because it does not explain HOW any of the buildings collapsed.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure the explanation is that a plain flew into the building, and the secondary explanation regarding &quot;truthers&quot; claims is that too much of the population is not scientifically literate.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Right, if it was a controlled demolition yes, otherwise no. Keep up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. Just no. Conservation of momentum does not apply to anything that has a constant gravitational acceleration. Controlled demolition or not, if something is falling, you have to include Earth as part of your conservation of momentum, otherwise and functionally speaking, you can not consider momentum to be conserved. Period.</p>

<p>Let me break it down for you, I feel like this point is important to convey clearly. I&#39;ll use sources too.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Momentum, by definition, is just mass x velocity. <a href="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/momentum/u4l1a.cfm">Source</a></p></li>
<li><p>Force, by definition, is mass x acceleration. <a href="http://zonalandeducation.com/mstm/physics/mechanics/forces/newton/mightyFEqMA/mightyFEqMA.html">Source</a></p></li>
<li><p>Weight is a type of force, defined as mass x acceleration due to gravity. <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/mass.html">Source</a></p></li>
<li><p>Acceleration has to do with the change in velocity. In other words, if an objects velocity isn&#39;t increasing, then it will not have a positive acceleration. <a href="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/1DKin/Lesson-1/Acceleration">Source</a></p></li>
<li><p>The law of conservation of momentum states that the momentum will remain constant no matter what until and unless any external force comes into action. <a href="http://physics.tutorvista.com/momentum/conservation-of-momentum.html">source</a> </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, put all of these very basic physics definitions together, and what can we conclude about falling bodies? Well, since acceleration due to gravity is positive (in the downward direction), then anything subjected to gravitational forces must have a constantly increasing velocity when unsupported (falling objects). What this amounts to is that falling objects colliding into each other do not experience a conservation of momentum because momentum is only conserved for a closed system. <a href="http://www.physlink.com/education/askexperts/ae602.cfm">Source</a> These objects would have a constant gravitational force acting on them which is constantly increasing their velocity. This is what acceleration is; it&#39;s an increase in velocity. What you&#39;re effectively suggesting by trying to ignore this is that falling objects have a constant velocity, which is not only objectively untrue, but it&#39;s one of those concepts in physics which you should have had a sense of by now just by being alive and looking at the world around you.</p>

<p>To be plain then, and so there is no confusion about what I&#39;ve just said, momentum is not conserved between falling objects that are colliding with each other, because falling objects are being acted upon by an outside force. </p>

<p>Now, with regards to your question about the fire, this is going to get a bit more technical, so straighten up and perk your ears up. I want to make a point, before I get started too, that not every law in physics is observable from your living room. Some things you only start to learn and understand by real studying, and from experiments that extend beyond the range of what you see in every day life.</p>

<p>Now, steel is an alloy that can be described basically as a composite of iron and carbon <a href="http://web.utk.edu/%7Eprack/MSE%20300/FeC.pdf">source</a>. It undergoes different phases depending on the material&#39;s temperature, detailed by the <a href="http://www.calphad.com/graphs/Metastable%20Fe-C%20Phase%20Diagram.gif">iron-iron carbide diagram</a>. Steel starts to change from ferrite and pearlite to austenite at about 723C <a href="http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/MSE2094_NoteBook/96ClassProj/examples/kimcon.html">source</a>. Ferrite has a yield strength of approximately 280 MPa <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrite_(iron">source</a>), where austenite has a yield strength of about 200 MPa <a href="http://www.asminternational.org/documents/10192/3473958/05231G_Sample.pdf/7c5e4830-b443-4c71-a8c8-1a85c5b39dc5">source</a>. The yield strength is the measure of stress which can be applied to a body before it permanently deforms <a href="http://www.engineersedge.com/material_science/yield_strength.htm">source</a>, so the stronger something is, the greater yield strength it has. Commercial jet fuel, Jet A, can burn as hot as 1030C in open air <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_fuel">source</a>, well over the temperature to change the phase of steel from ferrite/pearlite to it&#39;s weaker form, austenite. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because outside of 9/11, steel framed building collapses are unprecedented and a plane never hot WTC7, so that invalidates your other point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First off, my other point isn&#39;t invalidated just because you have another example to draw from. I think what you meant to say was &quot;You&#39;re right about the other towers, but what about WTC 7?&quot; Secondly, you know what else is unprecedented? Planes flying into skyscrapers. Believe it or not, but that may be a factor in all this (unless you can cite other examples of office fires being started with a truckload of jet fuel). </p>

<p>I know what you&#39;re thinking, but I&#39;m not going to address WTC 7 until you can either discredit what I&#39;ve just said or admit you&#39;re wrong and don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. Let&#39;s not hop from one thing to another too quickly now.</p>

<p>P.S. It&#39;s amazing to me that you can tell me to keep up, presumably with a straight face, when I&#39;ve been trying to explain conservation of momentum to you for my last three posts with no sign that even the smallest part of those explanations are starting to seep in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe I should&#39;ve been more accurate and said that as falling objects gain momentum downward, the Earth gains momentum upward, but if you&#39;re looking at the falling objects without considering the planet, as I&#39;ve said many times before, you can not consider momentum to be conserved.</p>

<p>You clearly have no clue how this law is applied. I&#39;ve cited sources, where you&#39;ve cited... That if I told someone else this, they&#39;d laugh at me? Objects accelerate as they fall.

    <div class="md"><p>No need to sling around insults, I&#39;m trying to explain basic fucking physics to you and this is the first time you seem to recognize this idea in any way. </p>

<p>Momentum is only a factor of mass and velocity. If you&#39;re increasing the mass with an increasing amount of load being added to lower floors over time, and increasing velocity with a constant acceleration, then momentum is going to be increasing over time.</p>

<p>The world trade center is not fucking proof of any physical laws, and you can&#39;t begin to understand what happened in these events, regardless of what that might be, without going back to these physical principles and really investing yourself into understanding the circumstance.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t say. They are not designed, however, to withstand jet impacts. This isn&#39;t an argument, and the argument is not that a building could not conceivably stay standing either, it&#39;s that it could conceivably, and dare I say likely, collapse in the way that it was observed to when a jet did hit it.</p>

<p>EDIT: And for the record, the argument &quot;skyscrapers are designed to stay standing&quot; doesn&#39;t work for the circumstance of a plane hitting it unless you also believe that a controlled detonation couldn&#39;t bring it down, or any other physical catastrophe, because, apparently, skyscrapers are designed not to collapse. It&#39;s fucking stupid to dismiss an argument on these grounds.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The official theory produced by NIST is flawed, not mine</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there&#39;s simultaneously no official explanation, and the official explanation is flawed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Great, get a source that agrees that fires can cause a steel framed skyscraper to completely collapse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I then explained how heat effects the integrity of steel with 7 different sources, ranging from pHd papers to explanations on easy to understand physics forums, and apparently this level of amateur explanation was so far below your supreme intellect that you couldn&#39;t even address it without lowering yourself.</p>

<p>Or, you know, you&#39;re full of shit and don&#39;t know how else to respond.</p>

<p>You also said,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Right, if it was a controlled demolition yes, otherwise no. Keep up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In direct response to my comment trying to explain in what way momentum is conserved with regards to falling objects. Because you apparently believe that the method used to make those objects fall has some bearing on how they gain or lose momentum. I am pretty sure you have no fucking clue what momentum is.</p>

<p>I would love to quote more of what you&#39;ve said, but most of it is just dismissive vitriol, based on claims that you&#39;re too smart to answer sourced explanations on why you&#39;re wrong, which you are evidently too bullheaded and ignorant to even think about and question for even a fraction of a second.</p>

<p>But I get it. It&#39;s much safer to dismiss an argument than to put your own forward. This would&#39;ve been a lot easier, I&#39;m sure, if you actually had any fucking clue about the &quot;science&quot; you keep referring to so confidently.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This behaviour was not observed at either WTC1 or 2.
Your theory, that the floors above the floors that were weakened by the impact of the airliner fell on the floor below, which started a chain reaction, so that the floors “pancaked” all the way down, does not make any sense, for a few reasons.</p>

<p>Both buildings accelerated towards the speed of gravity, without any loss of momentum, we are led to believe that no part of the building provided any resistance, the upper floors could not have fallen through them at the same speed as they would fall through air, only one theory can support that statement, controlled demolition, thus, the conservation of momentum is violated, if you are to believe the official reports.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the falling portion gains mass and momentum</p>

<p>Explain how this is even possible in a steel framed building, especially, when the evidence suggests the majority of the mass of the building, <a href="http://www.sharpprintinginc.com/911/images/photoalbum/8/1303767239_wtc1south3.jpg">was ejected outside of it&#39;s footprint</a>, it is even officially documented that a 300 ton section of WCT2, was found lodge in another building, over 120 meters away.</p>

<p>So if mass was taken away, which was clearly seen and both buildings were designed to withstand it&#39;s own weight several times over, how in your head are you making sense of this?</p>

<p>You are choosing to ignore basic science or you are ignorant, or you are trolling.</p>

<p>Natural weakening, bending or crushing because of fires, (as per the official report) there would be enormous forces of interaction with the structure bellow, if you do not agree there would be an interaction, then you are choosing not to believe in Newton&#39;s third law...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Formally stated, Newton&#39;s third law is: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The statement means that in every interaction, there is a pair of forces acting on the two interacting objects.

<p>This is why a new investigation is needed, the official version of events <strong>IS</strong> proved false by basic science reasoning, logic and common sense, not that you have a lot of this as you think Jesus is the best, but most normal, rational people can comprehend.</p>

<p>Allah is the greatest, Jesus was Allah&#39;s dog.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the dominoes aren&#39;t different sizes, what part of that don&#39;t you get? The only force acting on the dominoes is the initial bit of force on the very first one, and gravity. They will never destroy each other. If I shoot a baseball at a wall which has greater mass and density the baseball will be destroyed before the wall is.

    <div class="md"><p>Y&#39;all really need to stop parroting the third law of motion bs here. It just shows how little understanding you have of physics.</p>

<p>To try and keep it simple, this stuff would only really apply if the two parts of the towers were solid non hollow pieces not sections of floors stacked one over the other.</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t crushing the whole building at once, it&#39;s compressing one floor at a time very quickly.</p>

<p>You have the top part falling, and gravity acting on it. It hits the floors below them and compresses them (this compression also forces debris outward which accounts for another pointless theory about stuff flying out as it fell. To get a better idea, slam your hand down on an egg. The egg will be compressed and go outwards)</p>

<p>That adds to the weight slamming down and compressing the floors more and more and more. When cleaning up they found 14 floors compressed into a space less than 8ft.</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t crushing the whole tower at once as more supports give way more weight is coming down and more pressure being applied from the top.</p>

<p>What is throwing people off is that the process seemed to Happen rather quickly, but it didn&#39;t violate the 3rd law.</p>

<p>Only people that don&#39;t properly understand the third law and physics think that this violates the third law</p>

<p>Think of it kind of like pressing in on an accordion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re really mixing up your comparisons. The OP refers to the tower as two parts (top and bottom). When it collapses, he says that the top &#39;destroys&#39; the bottom.</p>

<p>I was using the same terminology, except my top was a single domino. The bottom was the rest. By &quot;destroy&quot; I meant the tower collapses. By a single domino.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, the top portion of the tower is made lighter than the base and midsections, the construction is less dense, and the portion which falls encountered almost zero resistance, completely out of line with what we know about building collapse from non-demolition examples. Only in controlled demolition could the top portion collapse and provide enough force to buckle every single layer beneath it as rapidly as it did. The building collapse should have slowed down as it neared the bottom as the material met with greater and greater resistance, but it didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>The analogy of dominoes is flawed because each and every one of those dominoes was placed WITH THE INTENTION OF COLLAPSE. Do you honestly think that someone would engineer a skyscraper to the same standards as a pyramid of dominoes?</p>

<p>Just a last question to help me clarify what you truthers are saying: Let&#39;s say one single floor did buckle for whatever reason (Floor x). All 16% or whatever of the tower falls down a floor, landing on the floor beneath it (Floor x-1). Do you believe that the weight and momentum of all the floors above floor x falling on floor x-1 is not enough to buckle it? Is that what you&#39;re saying?</p>

<p>A 1.5 meter domino tower structurally share more similarities to a 400 meter steel scyscraper than you can imagine. There are incredible forces in play here. It&#39;s not like steel is rigid and unbreakable when severeal million newtons of force act upon them.</p>

<p>Further, the debris from the towers collapsing was flown incredible distances, perhaps had these dominos somehow flown into another room of the house you&#39;d have a case.</p>

<p><em>Now</em> we can talk about Newton&#39;s laws of motion. Again, incredible forces in play. If a brick hit an incline from 400 meters of height, it would get propelled at great speed outwards. Now imagine this happening thousands of times. </p>

<p>It&#39;s basic physics; the structurally sound bottom portion of the towers had 3-5 times redundancy (it was capable of holding 3-5X the actual weight of the tower above it), so it should have been more than capable of stopping the towers&#39; full collapse.

<p>For the north tower, the top 10 stories would have been equivalent to <em>80 stories</em> worth of weight when falling.  In the south tower, the top 25 stories would have been equivalent to <em>200 stories</em>.</p>

<p>No they didn&#39;t. The statement claiming that was a theoretical statement made in a magazine article in 1964, we&#39;ll before the buildings had been built and well before any advanced modeling capabilities had been invented, and it was in reference to the perimeter columns only. </p>

<p>Designed in 1964, and not for the kind of catastrophe they experienced that day. One of the surviving designers said exactly that.

<p>Yes, most buildings are susceptible to collapse when thousands of tons of debris rain down on them, severing the fire suppression system and igniting fires on over a dozen floors that burn out of control without a drop of water for 7 hours.</p>

<p>Outside of 9/11, that scenario has never happened even once, so I think your worries are a little wasted. </p>

<p>The collapse models have been done by other engineers who came to the exact same conclusion as NIST.

<p>They were worried that doing so posed a security risk. </p>

<p>They did release something like 2000 pages of information including all the structural details of the building, blueprints and details on all assumptions used in their model. Anyone with training and an ANSYS system can model the collapse for themselves. </p>

<p>Aside from NIST, collapse models were done for the AEGIS insurance case by 5 trained professionals, and they all came to the same conclusion. </p>

<p>I love that you tell me a domino tower is nothing like the WTC, then you link me a video with <a href="http://youtu.be/8DOnAn_PX6M?t=3h15m11s">this</a>. A fucking tower of snow. Which is one big solid mass, unlike the WTC. The dominos have so much more in common with the actual WTC than both colliding cars and a tower of snow. I think you fail to realize that.</p>

<p>Also, lets imply the logic of the &quot;physicist&quot; in your video to the domino tower. One domino fell, then one more domino should have fallen in the domino example.</p>

<p>I would also like to state that the third law of motion is only applicabale when there is no forces doing work on the system. That is, if all forces acting on the system is perpendicular to the motion. Gravity is doing hell of a lot of work on this system, so you can&#39;t just throw around Newton&#39;s laws and think they will apply to your simplified versions of the system.</p>

<p>That is physically impossible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. Reference: About 20 different video angles of the WTC collapse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is absolutely nothing connecting that tower of dominoes together structurally.</p>

<p>Friction. Let me repeat myself: Upscaled to the size of WTC, the friction between dominos will be more or less the same as the bolts connecting the joints in the WTC.</p>

It&#39;s composed of lots of secured joints which, under the circumstances, were nearly irrelevant in the whole collapsing. You won&#39;t stop the innitial 30 stories falling with small bolts ssecuring the joints. Look up static vs. dynamic stress. </p>

<p>You say I can&#39;t upscale a kicking motion into the force of the plane hitting the building yet you say right after that I&#39;m too stupid to understand the laws of up scaling and you can compare an unsecured domino structure to a secured steel reinforced building? According to your logic, cement, nails, joints are all pointless and there is no difference between secured and unsecured structure, which is by far the dumbest thing I&#39;ve heard anyone say about this event. Why don&#39;t you build your next house by just stacking bricks then and don&#39;t join them together with any adhesive or reinforcement?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But anyways. You realize that&#39;s the securing the WCT isn&#39;t the same as cementing a tower of bricks?</p>

<p>Yes I do realize that, the towers were secured with steel columns and concrete, so it is far more stable than just cement and even less likely to collapse. And you also realize that a stack of dominoes isn&#39;t anywhere near as valid as a comparison to a secured concrete and steel reinforced structure?</p>

<p>The laws have been broken if you prescribe to the official story you dumb ass, 15 floors cannot destroy the rest of the undamaged structure and at almost free fall speed with what appears to be very little resistance. The potential energy used to construct the top 15 floors can only transfer to the kinetic energy to destroy another 15 or so floors, this is the law of conservation of momentum. There has to be an external source of energy to pulverize such a reinforced and secure structure completely to the ground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know you&#39;re clawing for arguments when you debunk a joke I made about the conspiracy theorists argumentation.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s ignore that from here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to your logic, cement, nails, joints are all pointless</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. In a building secured to support static forces, the cement, nails and joints are all pointless from the moment they get anywhere from 15 to 30 stories with kinetic energy, not only potential, (dynamic load) upon them. The  joints aren&#39;t secured to withstand that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why don&#39;t you build your next house by just stacking bricks then and don&#39;t join them together with any adhesive or reinforcement?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will build my house with enough support to withstand the walls, roof and some weather. Not 30 stories of steel and concrete falling upon it. You realize that this is what they did in the WTC.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the towers were secured with steel columns and concrete, so it is far more stable than just cement</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, upscaling. If you had a WTC sized block of bricks bound with cement, it would be more stable than the WTC. The WTC wasn&#39;t solid, it was built for electrics, plumbing, offices and halls. Lots of open space inside the building. Are we talking big blocks, yes, steel and concrete is more solid. Are we talking brick WTC vs. the hollow WTC, brick WTC is more stable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the law of conservation of momentum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False, you dumb ass. That&#39;s Newton&#39;s third law of motion. You can&#39;t apply that in the way you want to, you have to bring gravity into the mix. Suddenly it&#39;s not an isolated system, and it becomes extremely more complex than &quot;15 stories only destroys 15 stories&quot;. Gravity is doing work on the system <em>all the time</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There has to be an external source of energy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gravity is an external force, and it results in the top 15 stories having a lot more potential energy than the next 15 stories. Ie an external source of energy. That&#39;s your argument gone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The comparison may as well be made. Buildings are designed and built with safety factors in mind that take into account all the forces that the building might undergo during it&#39;s lifetime. People have to go to school and study extensively how to design a building that won&#39;t collapse under it&#39;s own weight alone. It&#39;s not correct to imagine that because buildings feel sturdy that they can withstand any kind of trauma and remain relatively in tact. </p>

<p>OP states that Newton&#39;s third law is violated because 15 floors destroys more than 15 floors. In my video, 1 domino destroys how many other dominos? You are using the terms of physics wrong, and that makes you sound less serious than your bullshit theories already does.</p>

<p>Stop using laws which doesn&#39;t apply to prove your points, and you might have a chance at being taken seriously. Reading the physics wikipedia page and jerking each other with two laws you think applies doesn&#39;t qualify for analyzing a building collapse, maybe you should get some education before calling people out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. I&#39;m gonna stop reading this very long-winded lunacy to ask one very important question.</p>

<p>You claim in this that two of the planes didn&#39;t crash, and imply that none of the victims on the planes were ever on the planes.</p>

<p>But we have seen interviews with practically every one of their families. There are people from all over the world who knew people that claim, as you would put it, that their family members or friends were on one of those flights.</p>

<p>So, if they weren&#39;t on the plane, and they didn&#39;t go back home (since we have not heard a single person come forward to say they were on Flight 93), then where did they go?</p>

<p>You are supposing a conspiracy of not just hundreds, but thousands or even millions of people, all of whom are so invested in the lie that not a single person has broken ranks.</p>

<p>As for the top portion of the towers taking down the bottom 2/3, have you ever seen a karate demonstration? They stack high stacks of tiles or brick, with pencils in between. The fighter punches through the top tile, which resists then falls onto the second tile, combining with the fist to punch further down. The same thing happens here, only the floors of the tower are much heavier than a tile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol - that&#39;s hilarious.  I was thinking the exact same thing about breaking boards.  I had to do it in TKD and that&#39;s why they use spacers because most people can&#39;t punch through five inches of solid pine but five one inch pine boards with a space between each board is a different matter.  I am sure a physicist (and I am definitely not one of those) could explain it in a more lucid fashion.</p>

<p>I have exactly the same issue as you in that literally thousands of people would need to have been actively and tacitly involved across all levels of the government, military, law enforcement and emergency services and public office in order to pull it off.  That&#39;s before you get into the broadcasters, publishers and private companies who were also apparently involved in some capacity or other.  It&#39;s virtually inconceivable that it wouldn&#39;t leak in some way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can vouch for this. I used to work CCTV systems.</p>

<p>Back around that era there were really no high bandwidth solutions as most footage was saved to magnetic strips or VHS tapes. They had to be at this frame rate and low resolution to be effective compromise between length:quality otherwise could you imagine the cost of how much physical storage you&#39;d need?</p>

<p>It&#39;s only been recently where CCTV have moved from analogue mediums into digital mediums. Had the 9/11 attacks happen today I can assure you that we would have 1080p 30FPS footage of that plane hitting the pentagon. </p>

<p>This footage from the Pentagon is pretty standard for that era of CCTV. The only way we would ever see more is from different angles. People need to remember that certain technologies were still very primitive in the early 2000s as digital transfer mediums such as IP hadn&#39;t really caught on yet. </p>

<p>how can you say this is disinformation when she has reliable sources for everything? hutchinson effect is a thing, hurricane erin is a thing, alaskan magnetic field activity on 9/11 is a thing, 80% of the towers not even hitting the ground is a thing.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I have not made any outlandish claims, claims for which there is no evidence at all.</p>

<p>My opinion on the collapse of the three towers is based on the available evidence, that does not violate basic laws of science and engineering and also does not require oneself to perform mental gymnastics to believe an impossible scenario</p>

<p>She is someone who is poisoning the well, she releases adverse information about 9/11 with the sole intention of discrediting and making way for ridiculing everything the truth movement stands for, which is finding out the real truth about what happened.</p>

<p>Go to a hate group on reddit, like conspiratard and you will see things like..</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>truthers are so stupid, they believe in the no planes theory/no building theory/directed energy weapons/nukes etc etc</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is a well know way to ridicule a whole group of people, if you are not aware of this then make yourself familiar with argumentum ad hominem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, this is a poorly constructed argument. The reason the &quot;debunkers&quot; are not coming here to refute every piece of evidence you&#39;ve given is not because they&#39;ve been pummeled down by your mountain of persuasive arguments, it&#39;s because you don&#39;t have any, and you&#39;re not supporting any of your claims. It&#39;s simply not worth the leg work.</p>

<p>Let me explain this though. In your first point, you wonder why, of the alleged 19 hijackers, only 3 were caught on CCTV. Don&#39;t you know why though? One of the hijackers worked in security and switched the tapes, programmed with a new time stamp. I&#39;ll link a video below of a CCTV tape showing a man walking into a room below with subtitles that validate my point. Prove me wrong. Dig up videotapes showing that this man was not both security and part of a terrorist organization. Show me evidence of why timestamps can&#39;t be changed.</p>

<p>Do you see the issue? Why should anyone even go through the trouble of refuting claims that have no substantial sources or backing to support them whatsoever? You literally posted a shitty out of focus image of a blue sky to support your claim that jet engines don&#39;t emit white smoke. This was your source. A picture of the sky. Well done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t believe anybody is still buying the controlled demolition nonsense 13 years later. Its be debunked since the beginning. Here are just a a extremely small smidget of analysis detailing the progressive collapse of the towers </p>

<ul>
<li>(Analysis 1)[<a href="http://www.911myths.com/WTCREPORT.pdf">http://www.911myths.com/WTCREPORT.pdf</a>]</li>
<li>(Analysis 2)[<a href="http://www.911myths.com/WTCREPORT.pdf">http://www.911myths.com/WTCREPORT.pdf</a>]</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem with conspiracy theorist is that the overwhelming majority of them would not be able to understand not one thing from those analysis. Its way above their head from an intellectual standpoint. they do not understand the math, the calculus, or the physics. This can be expanded to a bigger educational problem US where we are like last in developed nations when it comes to Math and science. There is great scientific ignorance in the United States, so when something of controversy like 9/11 comes around and involves so much math and physics just to explain the reasons why it collapses, it goes way over peoples heads; and leaves a lot of room for people to bullshit because they don&#39;t understand the math and physics. There is a reason why PhD Physicist and hundreds of thousands of engineers aren&#39;t outraged over the towers collapsing. . .its because they understand how it happened and know there was nothing fishy about it. . .<strong>when you do the math</strong>. But conspiracy theorist don&#39;t know math, they just know lingo, senseless lingo that is.</p>

<p>I mean just use your head here, do you know how much TNT would be needed to implode a building like the World Trade Center? a <strong>SHIT TON</strong>. It would be fucking obvious if it was a controlled demolition, everybody would&#39;ve heard it, you wouldve seen it. And the workers in the towers wouldve seen it, and probably even smelled it. And on top of that even if we gave that asinine theory any weight, if there were explosive devices in the Trade Center, it wouldve exploded when the plain hit it right then and there and cause a domino effect of explosions from the other explosive devices and collapsed the tower right then and there.</p>

<p>If you say &quot;no&quot;, or say something like &quot;Yeah, my question is why are you guys so stupid&quot; (or questions similar to that) then that means to me your just here for laughs at other people&#39;s expense.

But then again, after reading most of your posts, your just a plain old meanie who likes hurting people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, tell that to the assholes above &amp; below me making fun of the other redditors.  Sure sure.  </p>

<p>Most of the posters here who posted their questions or thoughts on what might have happened get down voted, as well as being made fun of.  Fuck it.  </p>

<p>Some people are just asking some honest-to-goodness questions about what actually happened on 9/11.  And some are providing some key insight thanks to their various backgrounds in physics, science, and/or technology, and they share that info to the community/world.  This leads ordinary people questioning the official line of 9/11.  </p>

<p>The official story &amp; the 9/11 Commission did not tell the truth, and as you can see, people are tired of being lied to.  Just like with any lie, if the truth came out, or if a lot of evidence of an &quot;inside-job&quot; were actually disproven, then this issue would&#39;ve <strong>died years ago!</strong>  It&#39;s still going on, just like the controversy of how JFK died.  Fuck it, people are tired of this New World Order.  </p>

<p>And to top it off, we now see the fruit that were born from 9/11 today in our world; evil atrocities, power vacuums leading to new civil wars, constant warfare in the Middle East, sudden burst of Arab Springs!?, and the hijacking of constitutional liberties &amp; rights of the people.  WMDs my ass.  Soft soil = planes sinking into the ground my ass.  No luggage, no bodies, but pristine terrorist passports found at the Pentagon which belonged to the terrorists, my ass! </p>

<p>Staying the high-ground, sticking to your morals, being good &amp; fair, and trying to seek peace... all of this is being washed away, and it&#39;s no wonder why a lot of nations now distrust the US, and/or each other.  The whole system  is falling apart.  Heck, climate change has been pretty severe too, but who cares, right? </p>

<p>So many people have died, and for what!?  Oil? Big corporations? Military Industrial complex wishing to sell more arms? A war based on false pretenses is totally evil in my books.  Soldiers (men &amp; women) are human beings, not just drones to go off to some god-forsaken place to die.  Non-interference of other nation&#39;s livelihood should be the most basic law of laws built into the world, but it&#39;s not. Spying, taking advantage of one&#39;s resources, planting false flags, ruining good politicians by smearing them in the lame-stream-media, and so on and so on.  </p>

<p>Fuck them.  And fuck those who make fun of people seeking the truth. </p>

<p>Of course some of the info put forward by some truthers are questionable, but that&#39;s not what I said, nor mentioned, in my post that you responded to.  There <strong>ARE</strong> some very legitimate questions that make the ordinary Joe question about what actually happened on 9/11.  </p>

<p>Again, I hope those people mocking others for asking some important questions could politely present their point of view. But alas, I&#39;m asking too much, cause this is the Internet.  Everyone&#39;s a Keyboard Kommandar. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re actually closer to the truth than you might think.  9/11 was a classic false flag inside job.   I believe it was conducted in two phases and I’ll break it down for you:</p>

<p>Phase 1</p>

<p>1) Prep WTC 1,2 and 7 for controlled demolition using ‘discreet’ explosions while all three buildings are in normal use.  (NB - Demolition charges must be able to withstand impact of planes and/or fires burning in the target buildings.)  WTC 3,4,5 and 6 just need to get messed up a little along with some buildings in the WFC but let’s just go for complete destruction of the big three on the day to avoid arousing suspicion.</p>

<p>2) Frame 19 Iraqi hijackers and use this as pretext to invade Iraq.  (Wait, we framed Saudis?  Dammit Jerry, you had one job! ONE JOB!)</p>

<p>3) Fire cruise missile at Pentagon and claim it was an American Airlines flight which will be diverted elsewhere and arrange for all passengers, crew and plane to ‘disappear’ as it were.  Also ensure prop wreckage is prepared ahead of time to be dropped at the Pentagon as part of the cover up.</p>

<p>4) Collect voice samples from anyone likely to fly on United 93 in order to fake phone calls with the families.  Fake a crash site at Shanksville and ‘disappear’ the plane, crew and passengers elsewhere.  </p>

<p>5) Warn Mayor Willie Brown not to fly.  He must be protected at all costs.</p>

<p>6) Inform the BBC ahead of time and make sure they have full scripts and timetables of pre-meditated mass murder.  </p>

<p>Phase 2</p>

<p>7) Make sure the NYPD, NYFD, FAA, NIST, FEMA, Popular Mechanics etc are all briefed with the official story.</p>

<p>9) Don’t tell anyone else, (especially Alex Jones - that guy is a loudmouth).</p>

<p>8) Check numbering.</p>

<p>That’s what happened and if you say different you are a Zionist shill, sheep, dupe of the conspiracy , disinformation agent etc.  Personally I like disinfo agent because that sounds like something where I’d get a cool ID card, a sharp black suit and a ray gun although being a Zionist shill probably pays better.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To the asshole below me, did you even read the OP&#39;s info on top?  No.  Think about it.  If it really did crash, where&#39;s the clam shell for the turbine? Duh!?  Where were all the bodies? No photos cause it was too graphic, huh?  Maybe all the bodies got sunk into the ground too, right?  Geez, you stupid dumb fucks need to wake-up before it&#39;s too late.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I usually get recommendations to watch this or that movie so I googled her and the first hit was that she had been debunked by Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth but aren&#39;t those were the guys who proposed the controlled demolitions theory in the first place?  Does this mean there&#39;s two factions of conspiracy theorists who oppose each other?  </p>

<p>I just had a few points I wanted to raise as a starting point with someone who believes a controlled demolition brought down WTC7.  I can post them if you like.  You might have valid counter points anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>  OK she appears believes in some kind of invisible free energy beams brought down the Towers so she&#39;s not likely to have much to say about controlled demolitions with explosives.</p>
