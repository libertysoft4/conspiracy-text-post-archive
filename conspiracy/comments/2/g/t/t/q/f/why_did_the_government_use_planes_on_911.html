        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a>, I&#39;ve been wondering, since they had already blamed Al-Qaeda for the bombing in 93 that used a truck bomb, why not just use a larger bomb? I mean obviously the buildings were rigged with explosives on 9-11, but why even use the planes? Why not just say that Al-Qaeda used an even bigger bomb?</p>

<p>By using planes, it seems to me that they were making the official story just that much more unbelievable. Anyone who looks into it can obviously see how impossible it would have been to bring those buildings down with planes. If it had only been explosives, it seems it would have been harder to disprove the official story simply because it seems much more plausible that explosives could bring down the towers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess that makes some sense, but I figure the stocks would have tanked even without the planes. Plus the largest sum of money made on the whole thing were the invasions with the military-industrial complex and international bankers cashing in big with those. The stock manipulations seem small in comparison. Perhaps too small to be worth it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well wouldn&#39;t the fear multiplier still be there? I think its just the sheer fact that america was attacked on such a scale and so many people died. In fact if they had used a truck bomb then couldn&#39;t they push the propaganda against ground travel. Imagine checkpoints along all major highways checking for bombs. Or restricting licences by requiring an oath to Obama or something like that. I think those kinds of things would step on our rights even more than the current restrictions on plane travel.</p>

<p>We agree with you 100%, but look at how many people <strong>still</strong> (to this day) stand by the official narrative. They could have said the Mothman did it and people would believe it. Fuck if I know why people are that dense...</p>

<p>That said, there&#39;s a lot of ways for &quot;traditional&quot; ways to fail. For example, a car bomb might not be able to get close enough, not strong enough, and only localized damage (need to destroy the &quot;core&quot;), or just get found out ahead of time. The skies are wide open, nothing to stop their plan (especially when NORAD stood down).</p>

<p>It also gives them a way to condition us to these &quot;safety checkpoints.&quot; This is part of enforcing the police state, don&#39;t be surprised if you see TSA checkpoints at malls, major highways, etc. Each crisis they use only furthers the agenda of a totalitarian rule.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it would be a harder sell to the public, especially considering the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_World_Trade_Center_bombing">Feb 1993 WTC bombing</a>. And maybe their insurance policies (Larry Silverstein) don&#39;t cover car bombings but the planes can be considered &quot;acts of god&quot;?</p>

<p>I&#39;m in full agreement that the planes idea was pretty dumb. There are sooo many holes in that story, but hey people still bought it.</p>

<p>Here is something that I find <strong>very interesting</strong> regarding the 1993 WTC bombing (from Wikipedia):</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The plan was that if the bomb truck was parked at the right place, the North Tower would fall onto the South Tower, collapsing them both.</strong> However, the tower did not collapse, according to Yousef&#39;s plan, but the garage was severely damaged in the explosion. Nevertheless, had the van been parked closer to the WTC&#39;s poured concrete foundations, Yousef&#39;s plan might have succeeded.[15] He escaped to Pakistan several hours after the bombing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The plan already failed and a &quot;bigger bomb&quot; isn&#39;t that easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course not, but people really don&#39;t tend to think scientifically about the matter. Also, the planes stories were very emotional and were far better propaganda than a simple car bomb (again).</p>

<p>Remember how they showed all the supposed calls and texts from the plane, people talking with their loved ones in their final moments. Then you had the heroic PA flight passengers &quot;fighting the hijackers&quot;. The sad videos of people jumping to their deaths, etc. It was a goulash of sorrow, horror, anger, and vengeance. It was a story they could keep going and going with all the content and death.</p>

<p>Also the controlled demolition wouldn&#39;t be able to work in the same fashion. If a bomb exploded at the bottom, why would the top floors start exploding in a rhythm? It would be too much a giveaway, but with the planes it could &quot;make sense&quot; (I use that term very loosely here).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For a controlled demolition to work, the building has to fall straight down into a neat pile (via freefall). To achieve such, the building can&#39;t just have the foundation destroyed.</p>

<p>Without freefall the building could (and easily <em>would</em>) tip over. That is not their goal, they wanted to systematically and neatly destroy three (technically four if you include the Pentagon wing) structures and call it a day. Bring out the boogeyman and 10 years later we&#39;re still buying the same story.</p>

<p>The WTC 7 building really is the smoking gun that it was all a sham. If anything it proves that however careless they might have been, it still worked GREAT. That says more about the public than it does those in power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We could go back and forth about what is &quot;more obvious than what,&quot; but at the end of the day they were very successful.</p>

<p>They did eliminate the chance of getting caught. The entire administration classified everything related to it and it was never properly investigated. Any attempt at a &quot;commission&quot; was a kangaroo court and obstructed.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been saying the same 9/11 truth stuff for years (basically we don&#39;t know exactly what happened but we do know the official story is little more than a fairy tale).

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good question that&#39;s worth thinking about. My conclusion is that if they used straight-up explosives it would be very hard to keep a thorough investigation on the buildings being performed, and also since the same methods as the 1993 bombing would be used, the government would receive blame because they failed to catch the same thing twice, with catastrophic consequences.</p>

<p>I honestly think this was a classic case of a misdirection tactic, that is to focus everyone on the planes so that in their sense of disbelief, they will forget about how much explosives it takes to crumble massive structures like the WTCs. It worked on many of us for quite some time, after all. Instead they could claim this was an unforseen event that caught them off-guard. They took a big gamble, and in the chaos afterwards, got away with everything. For now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess that makes sense, but I&#39;ve just always thought that if they&#39;d used a large bomb, any investigation that had been performed probably wouldn&#39;t have been able to find anything out of the ordinary. Even if they found extra explosives/thermite they would easily just explain it away as from the bomb. Case closed. That and since they&#39;d already gotten away with framing al-Qaeda with the 93 bombing, no one would suspect that it wouldn&#39;t be Al-Qaeda again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but it draws peoples&#39; attention away from the basement, even looking back at it. Relatively few people know about the theft, even if they know the airplanes were an inside job. I do think that number would be higher if it&#39;d been, say, a truck bomb. I think more people would make that connection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>more dramatic.  sure.</p>

<p>but i think it was mostly driven by the need to make it look like an &quot;outside&quot; attack.  </p>

<p>that is to say, <strong>if it was a bomb inside the building, larry silverstein could/would have been held accounting by the insurance companies for &quot;poor security&quot;.</strong></p>

<p>it needed to be an event that larry silverstein had (decisively) &quot;no control over&quot;, otherwise larry silverstein wouldn&#39;t be able to collect his insurance money, and &quot;rebuild&quot; (consolidating 2 outdated buildings worth of real estate into one modern, premium building).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think because with a plane, when its in the hands of a terrorist, there is nothing that can be done besides shoot it down. No one person can stop a plane in flight. Trucks filled with explosives gotta jump over a lot of obstacles to get to their destination. </p>

<p>A truck bomb big enough to take down the WTC from the base would have to have a massive amount of explosives I think. That much explosives (3 buildings worth) should be able to be accounted for. On a side note: I read somewhere that the explosives used in the WTC buildings were laundered through the filming of Michael Bay&#39;s Pearl Harbor movie which came out months earlier. Real subtle guys... </p>

<p>And then once you have that much explosives, you got to sneak it in there somehow. Any random security guard check could blow the whole operation. I personally just think it would be a lot harder to take those buildings down with truck bombs at the base. </p>

<p>None of it makes any sense when you really think about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a really interesting question. Let&#39;s start by pointing out the fact that the &#39;attack&#39; was obviously meant to specifically take out WTC1, WTC2, and WTC7, leaving the surrounding buildings (meaning non-Silverstein buildings) relatively unscathed. Why did they want to avoid damaging or collapsing other buildings? Well, those building owners are going to want insurance settlements, and those insurance companies are going to want physical evidence. The more people poking around in the rubble, the faster the whole thing falls apart. So, they pay off Larry Silverstein; he gets a huge insurance payout and doesn&#39;t make any noise.</p>

<p>In order to achieve this, the buildings needed to come straight down into their footprints, which, as we saw, is what happened. A bomb big enough to take out both buildings, plus building 7, would have taken out most of Manhattan along with it. Having New York City essentially wiped off the map would cause global chaos due to the impact on financial markets. They weren&#39;t ready to deal with that (and still aren&#39;t). Even if huge bombs went off in the basements and the buildings were subsequently brought down from the bottom up, there would have been no way to disguise the controlled demolition. If the supposed collapse had been explicitly caused by a bomb, then investigators would have specifically had to test for explosives, and that would be a big fucking problem. It would have been very difficult to explain the presence of several types of explosives, <em>especially</em> nano-thermite. Even though WTC7 came down in a classic controlled demolition, this collapse was overshadowed by the falling of the two larger towers, and further hidden by the media. </p>

<p>In the minds of those who planned this, the plane crashes provided a plausible reason for the buildings to &#39;collapse&#39; (obviously, as this is the story they have stuck to for 13 years). The planes were really just theater, a distraction. I&#39;m sure they probably considered missiles, but that would have raised too many eyebrows, and more importantly, without the jet fuel fires there would be no plausible cause of the heat required to weaken the steel. Since most people really don&#39;t have any frame of reference for a building collapsing from the top down, they were able to push the &#39;jet-fuel weakened steel, pancake collapse&#39; story line. Another benefit to bringing down the buildings the way they did, as opposed to bombing them, is that the steel columns were severed into nice manageable pieces, and the concrete was pulverized. This allowed them to get the evidence off site in a hurry. Within 18 days of the attacks, 130,000 tons of mostly steel had been removed from site and shipped to China. Basically, while everyone was still in shock, they got as much evidence as possible offsite.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR Mainly for logistical and plausibility reasons. A bomb would have been too big and required tests for explosives, a missile wouldn&#39;t have caused enough fire, and a straight up controlled demolition would have been way too fucking obvious.</strong></p>

<p>My two cents on the topic doesn&#39;t even begin to address how the use of planes allowed TPTB to expand the security and surveillance state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the whole point of using planes as cover was to get money to some person (be it the TSA president or whatever their leader is) or some corporate CEO, why not just give them a deal making guns for the inevitable invasion of Iraq instead of making x-ray detectors for the TSA?</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is it makes no sense to use that cover of the planes, even if there was some backroom deal. It just made that backroom deal more likely to be found out.</p>
