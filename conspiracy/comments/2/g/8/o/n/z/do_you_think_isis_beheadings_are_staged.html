    <div class="md"><p>I think they were objectively manufactured to be both &#39;fit for broadcast&#39; and &#39;unfit for broadcast&#39; in a sense that they are either informed as to what the limits of western palatability allows, or were edited post-hoc to allow their broadcast (not on TV you understand, I mean the original uploads)....</p>

<p>I have huge doubts about britboy being the executioner, and I consider it a PR stunt. As to who directed the piece of media, I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>They are either savvy, or informed or the data is being vetted before release by a separate source.</p>

<p>I think you could feasibly survey the narrative of the media and correlate it to the tweets of ISIS dikheads on the ground given the time and interest and willingness to follow all those pricks and what it entails, but I don&#39;t fancy that job.</p>

<p>I cannot for the life of me figure out why they would edit out the actual beheading. Perhaps because it takes to long with a knife? Why are they using a knife? </p>

<p>The videos bring up a lot more questions than something like that should. Or at least it brings up the wrong questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well... I guess what I&#39;m saying is that they really killed him for the movie. Yes, it was staged in the sense that they brought a camera out to the desert to film a scripted monolog then did some video editing but they also decapitated human beings... kinda hard to fake that. Not impossible, but I think the dude is dead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you CAN fakr a beheading. See hollywood. Also in foleys video there is 0 blood. They use a small knife thwt doesnt look that sharp, looks like a prop knife. Then after 2 &#39;cuts&#39; it skips to black and you see a body on the ground.</p>

<p>I dont really know, but all other beheading videos ive seen were way more gruesome. People were screaming and crying. Foley doesnt let out a single tear or scream.</p>

<p>And the fact the video is cut up like yhat (no pun intended) really makes me question the integrity of it all.</p>

<p>Sorry about your mate. It doesnt matter what happend..people died. And thats the worst part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure.  The first video definitely had some questionable elements to it, they cut the video right as they start to slit his throat, and when they show the body later the arms and legs are shaved which is weird.  I saw some video&#39;s detailing what was strange and how they could have been staged, but I still think they could have been real.  The biggest thing for me is the fact that they cut the video feed at all.  I&#39;ve never seen a beheading or execution video do that.  Instinctually that&#39;s the biggest thing that makes me wonder.  Also, as many people point out, there is no blood in either video, he goes to cut the throat and it appears he is slashing, but usually there would be some blood gushing out very quickly so that is pretty suspicious... but again I&#39;m not sure.</p>

<p>either by Scott Creighton, Reuters, or RT.com</p>

<p>somebody could be suckering Obama and the US into war in the the middle east.</p>

<p>they are dumb enough in washington to fall for this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>go look at my comment in that thread, the second picture has massive ELA, all those white bits are jpeg errors from the copy/pasting process, the palettes do not match up when composite pictures are made.</p>

<p>the first one has less errors, but still some evidence of copy/pasting.</p>

<p>you can see the same errors on most MSM MH17 pictures from the Ukraine, some are subtle, some are blindingly obvious and sloppy pictures.</p>

<p>journalists and editors use Adobe Photoshop for their composite picture sessions, its crap, or they are trained to use it on easy mode.</p>
