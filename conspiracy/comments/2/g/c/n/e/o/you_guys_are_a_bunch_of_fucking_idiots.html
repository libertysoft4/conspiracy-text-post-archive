    <div class="md"><p>You fallaciously accept the actions of individuals in our midst and generalise into degrading the community, based solely on this false projection you interpret as communitive group think.

<p>It&#39;s rather childish and naive, don&#39;t you think? To suppose matters you have no practical knowledge of, to denigrate others you haven&#39;t even explored, to limit yourself with such a simplistic policy of hierarchy and importance.</p>

Who are you to say some of the people that come here do not whole-heartedly believe in half the stuff posted here as much as we pay attention to how these people come to their conclusions therefor learning a new way of thinking. Instead of being stuck in the same mindset and try to learn a new way of thinking? Yet you better yourself by believing people you know nothing about are idiots? You&#39;re right i do disagree with it. Even the dumbest person on the planet has a different perspective of something and knowing that perspective may not improve your idea on the subject but can more or less increase your way of thinking about others.
