        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let&#39;s be rational about this.<br/>
The latest beheading was justified by the ISIS as payback to England<br/>
for colluding with the USA to destroy ISIS.<br/>
Seriously, what&#39;s the logic behind it? &quot;I&#39;m going to kill a white dude to further<br/>
incite other white dudes to come here and kill me.&quot;<br/>
Even for a radical muslim, that makes absolutely no sense at all,<br/>
if the goal is to PREVENT western nations from attacking.<br/>
It seems, as if ISIS wants the west to invade (again) and wage war on their soil.<br/>
Well, why would ISIS want that? It is not beneficial for muslim locale,<br/>
however it is very beneficial to western oil corporations.  </p>

<p>So, the members of ISIS are actually western agents, posing as radical muslims,<br/>
to give western countries a pretext to invade and wage war in the Middle-East.<br/>
Therefore, we should ignore all beheadings by ISIS and let them go,<br/>
to prevent us from playing ourselves straight into the hands of the oil corporations. </p>

<p>There are freemasonic fingerprints all over Ferdinand&#39;s death, not to mention the Zionist/Rothschild Balfour Declaration as a major factor in both world wars.</p>

<p>They wanted a war to scare the world into accepting a &quot;League of Nations&quot; as well as an Israeli state.</p>

<p>Neither ended up working out, so they created the conditions for another, even more devastating war. They succeeded that time, getting their United Nations and Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that ISIS has murdered a lot more folks than just those three. I watched the videos of them killing hundreds of young Muslim men, though I wish now that I hadn&#39;t. The point I was trying to make, is that the Government is trying to drum up support for a war with ISIS based on the purported beheading videos. Which is three people. Why are they not trying to drum up support for was where many, many more people have been murdered. I just don&#39;t understand how any sane person can conclude that those three lives taken in those videos are worth more than the thousands of deaths occurring all over the region. Or that somehow those lives are worth going to war over but all the other lives are not. It sickens me </p>

However, the speculation I made before this one was that the Estonian  police agent was kidnapped by FSB agents before the FSB confirmed their involvement. My statement rustled a lot of jimmies, but eventually I was vindicated.<br/>
So, I&#39;ve got that going for me, which is nice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all seems so convenient. Remember when they wanted to bomb Syria last year and the public came down hard on the idea? So now we get a beheading a week to try and turn the message around and FOX News and others are gleefully banging the war drums every quarter-hour. </p>

<p>Plus, giving weapons and training to Syrian moderates? Is there such a thing? What about the reports that these journalists that are being beheaded may have been sold to ISIS from these so-called moderates?</p>

<p>Also while I am at it. I wish I never hear the words, &quot;Islam is a religion of peace&quot; ever again. I even heard David Cameron lead with this line this morning and it must be some kind of cruel joke. </p>

<p>I say, declare you far fetched theory proudly and without equivocation. The truth stands on it&#39;s own. It needs no disclaimer on the outset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because it will obviously bring about the very opposite effect. The West is more powerful than the mid-east therefore does not feel intimidated. This behaviour by &quot;ISIS&quot; and the media coverage only encourages further war and destruction in mid-east-- this is the zionist agenda.

<p>&quot;We gonna bomb a country full of random brown people, based on the assumption that then, no more brown people will randomly attack us?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If ISIS were legitimate, they&#39;d make a video stating that they had no quarrel with the West (even if they really did) and that they just wanted to control their own lands, free from colonialism. Any beheading they did would be kept on the down low for now.  </p>

<p>And Bush and Cheney lied about a lot. The idea that all these wars are design to decrease attacks on the West is insane. They are trying to stir us all up against one another with false flags and indiscriminate killing. They want instability.</p>
