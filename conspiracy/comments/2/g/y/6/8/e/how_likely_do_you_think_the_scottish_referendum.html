    <div class="md"><p>I think that it was rigged but not in a typical change the votes way. I think that the political and behavioural scientists who are the brains behind the decisions were certain that they could produce a no vote through manipulation of social and traditional media and the deployment of well timed fear mongering. I think if the ability to manipulate the outcome was in any doubt then a referendum would not have been offered.</p>

<p>This whole story reminds me of something said in a Simpsons episode (I think), it went along the lines of &quot;the secret of a good sitcom is that at the end of the story everything returns to normal&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you meant your second sentence to be the other way around.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve said this several times. Scotland already has its own parliament and its own government, and the pro-independence SNP are currently in power. The Scots were completely responsible for all aspects of the referendum, London played no part in it. </p>

<p>There needs to be a credible argument as to why the SNP would rig the referendum to get an outcome they didn&#39;t want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure it can, if you have a very opaque vote counting system like electronic voting machines, where only a handful of individuals know how the machines were programmed. </p>

<p>But I seriously don&#39;t think it&#39;s feasible with a tried and tested paper ballot system which has multiple public vote counts and cross-tallies, and which is scrutinised by interested local activists <strong>from both parties</strong>, and independent observers, throughout the entire voting process. Everybody, including the local activists would have to be in on it. </p>

<p>The system was designed to make fraud as difficult as possible. It&#39;s not perfect - I would like to see the issuance of postal ballots tightened up, for instance, but I honestly believe the system we have of counting votes, is the fairest and safest system there can possibly be.</p>
