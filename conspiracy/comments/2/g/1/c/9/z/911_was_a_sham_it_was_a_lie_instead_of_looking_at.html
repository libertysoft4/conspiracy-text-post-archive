    <div class="md"><p>I am going to be transcribing the key points of the video here. This post will be constantly edited till I finish watching the video. <del>Help me find sources and maybe we can make a difference.</del> <strong>EDIT:</strong> all the sources for the video are in the video&#39;s description.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>September 1991 - George H.W. Bush and a number of bankers and people in intelligence, finance a $240 billion dollar covert operations war chest (called Project Hammer) that were scheduled to come due on September 12th, 2001.</p></li>
<li><p>Project Hammer was mainly used to finance a cover economic operation against the collapsing Soviet Union, where &quot;unknown&quot; Western investors bought up much of the Soviet industry, with a focus on oil and gas, crashing the Russian economy, looting its central bank, orchestrating the &quot;great ruble scam&quot; and a number of other clandestine operations meant to keep Russia from ever competing with the U.S. as a world super-power.</p></li>
<li><p>Several agencies were collecting and compiling evidence on Project Hammer up until 9/11. This included the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), which was moved to the outer E ring of the recently renovated section of the pentagon that was hit on 9/11. </p></li>
<li><p>DIA E.P. Heidner of ONI said they had been investigating the crimes associated with the plundering of Russia. 39 out of the 40 people who worked in those offices were killed on 9/11, including ONI&#39;s entire chain of command.</p></li>
<li><p>Many passengers on Flight 77 held &#39;top secret clearances&#39; and were connected with Pentagon black operations.</p></li>
<li><p>Agents of ONI were also investigating financial transactions linked to securities being managed by those security dealers in the world trade center that were also targeted.</p></li>
<li><p>31% of the 125 fatalies in the Pentagon were from the Naval Commander Center that housed the Office of Naval Intelligence. </p></li>
<li><p>41% of the fatalities in the Twin Towers came two companies that managed U.S. government securities: Cantor Fitzgerald and Eurobrokers.</p></li>
<li><p>There were three major securities brokers in the World Trade Center: Cantor Fitzgerald, Eurobrokers, and Garbon Inter Capital. Cantor Fitzgerald was the largest securities dealer in the U.S.</p></li>
<li><p>Fire and explosions reported in the World Trade Center: under the FBI offices in the North Tower on the 23rd floor, fires on the 22nd floor at 8:47, explosions and fires reported at Garbon Inter Capital on the 25th floor and basement of Tower 1. Shortly after, at 9:03, Flight 175 hit the South Tower- directly beneath the floors in which Euro Brokers was situated. In all these cases, the explosive, fire destruction consumed the offices in the several floors above, destroying files and trapping victims.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> had to stop to go shopping</p>

<p>continuing</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Building 6 was destroyed by an explosion that took place before either tower fell. This secondary explosion took out a portion of the building which just happened to include the El Dorado Task Force&#39;s offices. </p></li>
<li><p>The El Dorado Task Force was an inter-agency money laundering watchdog group responsible for coordinating all major money-laundering investigations in the U.S. In the immediate aftermath of September 11th, these groups would be redirected to investigate terrorist financing. </p></li>
<li><p>FEMA photographer and 9/11 whistleblower Kurt Sonnenfield testified to entering the U.S. Customs Vault in the basement of WTC 6, which was found completely empty and left with the door wide open. All of its contents appear to have been looted during the attacks. There is also evidence that gold was being looted from the vaults beneath WTC 4- there were several early reports of a 10-wheel truck packed with stolen bullion, caught fleeing WTC 5 when the vehicle had become stuck on a collapsed ceiling brace, forcing the driver to flee the scene.</p></li>
<li><p>Fireproofing &quot;upgrades&quot; on the exact floors coinceding with failure and impact in the towers. Suspicious power-downs and evcuation drills.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed that people make fun of folks on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for calling people shills at the drop of a hat, and while I&#39;m sure that some of the trolls or others on here <em>are</em> paid to cause problems or disrupt conversation, I think it both cheapens the term to use it so casually and tarnishes our image/credibility if we <em>appear</em> to assume that every contradictory opinion or troll is a shill.</p>

<p>What can we do about this? Too, there are undoubtedly people on here who pose as caricatures of conspiracy theorists to become sort of living straw men, so even if the user base on the whole is acting sensibly with the use of the term, there would still be shills/trolls throwing it out wantonly.</p>

<p>Pulling out a standard &quot;You&#39;re dumb&quot; response is like putting a giant blinking neon sign that says &quot;I&#39;m here to do a job and I just checked another box on my time-sheet.&quot;</p>

<p>Wait, why am I telling you how to do your job better??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to consider the question of whether they had valid reason to believe the President&#39;s own life was in immediate danger. In a post-9/11 environment it&#39;s easy to assume an instant &quot;the country is under attack&quot; response. But these attacks were something of a surprise, and not necessarily indicative of a personal assault. Was the President evacuated from wherever he was when the Unabomber blew something up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure they do have an escape plan in the presence of a <em>proximate, known and immediate</em> danger - say, a guy with a gun shooting in a motorcade crowd. Whether or not planes flying into buildings thousands of miles away from the president qualifies as an immediate danger is up for debate.</p>

<p>Certainly implying sinister foreknowledge on behalf of the Secret Service has its own logical pitfalls for the average conspiracist. If the president&#39;s bodyguards were in on it who <em>wasn&#39;t</em> told of this plan, the greatest and most secret false flag in human history? Surely to make it appear authentic the Secret Service <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> be told, right? </p>

<p>Seriously, from the view of the shadowy conspirators supposedly behind 9/11, what is the value of telling the Secret Service about the plan in advance? I&#39;ll answer for you: none. </p>

<p>Therefore like most conspiracist tropes, this fails at the first level of cursory scrutiny.</p>

<p>I also think that George gave orders to his staff that they weren&#39;t to interrupt the event. I bet he even used the words or very similar words to the effect, I don&#39;t care what it is. I don&#39;t want to be interrupted. Whatever it is can wait till this is over.</p>

<p>In my mind it explains that look on his face. He didn&#39;t want to have been told about the attack. Once he was, HIS PLAN had been changed. He was mulling over the consequences of this. That&#39;s the confused look on his face.</p>

<p>He just sat there. His body language didn&#39;t even give the slightest hint that he really wanted to spring to action as it should have. He was just told that The Nation was under attack. The commander in chief should be at minimum seeking more information to properly assess the situation. Instead he spent critical minutes just SITTING THERE.</p>

<p>That should have gotten him impeached. We had video proof that he was unfit for office. </p>

Its baffling to see people still don&#39;t believe this after all the evidence that&#39;s been revealed to the public. Now with the NSA leak, Ferguson incident, and net neutrality constantly being threatened, makes me honestly believe are country has been moving towards a police state, if it already isn&#39;t in the early stages. Add that with economically issues, it just becomes so obvious. Yet most of us are too distracted by television, movies, sports, video games, etc. to even give it a second thought or aren&#39;t concerned enough. The government knows this too and uses it, making the people who want to fight it pretty much futile too. It&#39;s a really bad situation.</p>

<p>In your report, you note that the NSA picked up intelligence on three of the 9/11 hijackers in 1999. Can you broadly describe this?</p>

<p>Several times in 1999, the NSA analyzed communications that involved individuals who, after 9/11, we came to find out were hijackers. They analyzed communications involving an individual named &quot;Khaled,&quot; who turned out to be Khalid al-Mihdhar; Nawaf, who turned out to be Nawaf al-Hazmi; and finally, I think in late 1999, they had the name Salem, who was Salem al-Hazmi. The NSA knew that those individuals were connected with a suspected terrorist facility in the Middle East—one tied to Al Qaeda efforts against U.S. interests.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s pretty significant information. Unfortunately, at least in the beginning, the significance was not recognized. It was not immediately passed on to other members of the intelligence community. And it makes one wonder: Had we been able to realize how significant that was, put it together, and get it to the agencies that could have made use of it in time, would there have been a different end to the 9/11 story?</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://archive.org/details/abc200109110831-0912">Here&#39;s a recording of ABC&#39;s Good Morning America on 09/11/2001</a>...w/ co-hosts Charlie Gibson and Diane Sawyer. At 23mins into the recording (8:54am), Diane begins interviewing ABC correspondent Donald Dahler, who is &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Dahler">reporting live via telephone from his apartment just blocks away a few moments after the first plane hit the towers</a>&quot;.</p>

<p>SAWYER: &quot;Don, where are you and what do you know?&quot;</p>

<p>DAHLER: I&#39;m about 4-5 blocks just north of the WTC...and about 10-15 minutes ago there was loud sound...I can only describe it as <strong>it sounded like a missile, not an airplane</strong>...and it was definitely not the sound of a prop airplane, or anything like that.</p>

<p>SAWYER: And, am I right, are you a pilot?</p>

<p>DAHLER: Well...I grew up on military bases and I know the sounds of jets, and I&#39;ve been in war zones and heard these different kinds of sounds...<em>it was perhaps a jet</em>, but it could have been a missile as well.</p>

<p>GIBSON: Could you give me...was it a whining sound, Don, or what?</p>

<p>DAHLER: Yes, it was a...it was high-pitched, but it a whooooshing sound, not like a prop plane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What he &#39;clearly&#39; said in the interview was that &quot;<strong>it sounded like a missile, not an airplane</strong>&quot;.  (note* the ellipses are used to show some [irrelevant] gaps in the recording) Also, I&#39;m not offering Dahler&#39;s testimony as any &#39;proof&#39; of a red-flag operation. I simply think it odd that it&#39;s literally the very first report from the scene broadcast on national tv. That&#39;s a mighty impressionable first impression, in my esteem. Furthermore, he starts walking it back almost immediately, pleading that he doesn&#39;t want to cause undue alarm, lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was a kid (4th grade) and that stuff happened. I didn&#39;t understand. As a teen I ignored people who said &#39;the attack was fake&#39; because human lives were lost and using archaic logic of mine, people dead, there was an attack (by mysterious people I couldn&#39;t understand). Now as an adult I finally understand the false flag attacked that happened. Nevertheless human lives (not just American) were lost. It doesn&#39;t matter to me what difference in culture; everyone fights and wages wars over things, ideals, wealth, resources, etc. just trying to survive. </p>

<p>The problem I have with that website, is it is obviously pushing an agenda, it quotes 20 people who may or may not have seen a plane of some sort, but there is a further list in the sources of around 70 people that did see a commercial airliner before impact.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11 was committed by trained mice, not men. The fact is planes never hit the twin towers, they are still flying to this day and have not landed. The fact that you saw planes hit the twin towers on video was just an optical illusion mixed with a mass hallucination. Hundreds or Thousands of mice who were given vaccines and GMO foods were being controlled by the Illuminati and chewed through the steel supports of the twin towers (using mutant powers from the GMOs), starting fires as they started chewing through electric cables. The twin tower attacks were an attempt to destroy financial firms that tracked debt in order to try to prevent Hostess, the company that made Twinkies and other snacks, from having to pay their debt. Unfortunately there were copies of their loans and notes and they went under. Twinkies are the favorite snack of the Illuminati and helped in the legal defense of Dan White who murdered Harvey Milk, a openly gay political leader in San Francisco. This crime was ultimately used along side the Brady Campaign (another Illuminati plot) to initiate sweeping gun bans including several &#39;assault weapon&#39; bans. If you want to blame someone don&#39;t blame our government, blame the Illuminati that has been attacking our government seizing control where it can.</p>

<p>Every 9/11 truther has heard this argument a million times.  And every 9/11 truther has laughed a million times.  The claim is pure assumption; it assumes the U.S. government is incompetent, disorganized, and unable to pull off an operation of this magnitude.  It also fails to account for the fact that, when we talk about the &quot;government&quot; being involved, we&#39;re not talking about the dysfunctional jackasses in Congress.  We are talking about organizations like the CIA and Military Industrial Complex.  You think the wealthiest, most technologically-advanced government entities this planet had ever seen, which also employ some of the best &amp; brightest minds this planet has to offer, couldn&#39;t possibly fool you or the population as a whole?  That&#39;s <em>adorable</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s lots of reasons to think there was a conspiracy behind these events but there&#39;s few concrete pieces of evidence to show that such a conspiracy actually existed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So?  Are you aware that a terrorist by the name of Timothy McVeigh was convicted largely on <strong>circumstantial evidence</strong>?  Very few &quot;concrete pieces of evidence&quot;, no witnesses placing McVeigh at the scene, but convicted by a court of law nonetheless.  That is why the government brought in Joseph Hartzler to prosecute the case, because he was well-known for building solid cases on <em>circumstantial evidence</em>.</p>

<p>People come in here all the time crying about &quot;physical evidence&quot;, like they want one of us to produce a handwritten letter written in blood from Dick Cheney n&#39; Pals, giving a full confession.  Funny how there is plenty of legal precedent for the acceptance of circumstantial evidence, but when it comes to 9/11, all the Official Story Fanboys want you to produce &quot;concrete physical evidence&quot; in the form of a smoking gun.  Nope, they can&#39;t accept the literal <em>mountain</em> of circumstantial evidence that suggests the official story is horseshit.  They&#39;ll only accept &quot;concrete, air-tight physical evidence&quot;!  That&#39;s fucking <em>adorable</em>, too.</p>

<p>The physical evidence for a 9/11 inside job is even more profoundly dwarfed by the physical evidence for an AQ terrorist attack </p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists string together little anomalies and theories to bolster their story and package them in a 2 hour Gish gallop youtube video. If someone went to the trouble of putting together a youtube video outlining the evidence in favor of the official story, it would be ten times as long and 100-times better sourced. </p>

<p>Then why hasn&#39;t anyone done so?  Better yet, why hasn&#39;t NIST provided us with their data inputs so that we can run their models ourselves and see if they stand up to scrutiny?</p>

<p>No, you would actually find anomaly after anomaly that go against the official story.  Youtube videos are not the main source of information, they are just summaries to use as launching points.  Just as mainstream news is not, and should not be, a main source.  To really research something, to build a base of unbiased facts, and to actually learn things, you must go through the act of &quot;discovery&quot;, personally subjecting yourself to all evidence available and forming your own opinions.</p>
