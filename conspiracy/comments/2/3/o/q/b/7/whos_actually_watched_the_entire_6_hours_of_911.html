I understand confirmation bias, but if you assume (i) she&#39;s either in a plane actually being hijacked, or (ii) she&#39;s in some hangar someplace with no idea why she is being asked to lie to her husband, then list all of the phrases it sounds like she is saying, and cross-reference them to each of the the above two scenarios.</p>

<p>They could have diverted them elsewhere and landed and allowed phone calls for some reason (amp up the storyline).  It explains the lack of any engine noises/screams.  Who knows, it&#39;s just one of 10000000 things that doesn&#39;t add up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not two conflicting things...it&#39;s two separate possibilities: </p>

<p>A. She is on a plane where angry/yelling Arabic men have just stood up together, stormed the cockpit, killed the pilots with box cutters and hijacked the plane....OR</p>

<p>B. She was removed from the plane by men (possibly wearing masks), escorted into some building (or the jet could have taxied into a hangar where she and the other passengers were removed), and taken to a room. If it was a planned government act, the people carrying this out would want to keep the panic to a minimum, as having uncontrollable, screaming people would create a situation that is less stable.</p>

<p>So which one fits based on the call?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the McGurk effect has a visual component so it (or anything similar) isn&#39;t relevant.</p>

<p>What is relevant is a form of confirmation bias. As I wrote in this thread in another reply, she is either: (i) on a plane actually being hijacked, or (ii) in a hangar (or some unknown place) afraid and having no idea why she (or the woman speaking) is being asked to lie to her husband, or who the people are who are holding them captive.</p>

<p>You need to conform what she could be saying to what makes sense in one the above two scenarios.</p>

<p>Further, listen carefully to the woman explaining to her husband about the hijacking and how she &quot;really hopes&quot; to talk him again. Listen to the whole message carefully.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume she was aboard a plane where only moments ago, Arab men yelling orders in a foreign language (or English with middle eastern accent) had just stood up, violently killed the pilots with box cutters, and hijacked the plane. If her call was a secret attempt to call their loved ones, I&#39;d think she would sound absolutely terrified or hysterical. </p>

<p>Instead, she says in a more unsure (but definitely worried) tone, &quot;I really hope I will talk to you soon&quot; (or something to that effect).</p>

<p>Just try it as an exercise...using everything you can glean from her call...her words, her emotional state, and her tone of voice, which of the above two scenarios fits better?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that her manner is strange for the alleged situation. Another thing that always gives me pause about her call is when in the beginning she says, Babe, I need you to listen very carefully (etc) it&#39;s very measured and odd and emphasizing... I&#39;m not sure what, but communicating something to  her husband. If I&#39;m not mistaken, he was a police officer at the time and she had been until about 3 months prior when she became a flight attendant. Of course, her LEO experience would enable her to remain calm as well.. I&#39;m curious what her husband thinks now that some years have passed especially, though I would never ask him of course, don&#39;t hit me reddit :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In once of the articles I posted today, there are credible theories that some, if not all of these callers, believed they were part of a training exercise.</p>

<p>There is a transcript of another call from a passenger...he begins:</p>

<p>&quot;Hello Mom? This is Mark Bingham...&quot; as if he was told roughly what to convey to her (or a relative) and he was trying to get it right and was nervous</p>

<p>...because in any situation, I mean even one where there are terrorists aboard your plane, you don&#39;t call your mom and begin the conversation by telling her your full name. (??)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After pondering these phone calls and the mystery as to where the callers were located (if not in the air), I remembered that people were talking in forums 4 or 5 years ago about fake passenger lists, flights that never boarded not took off, and the complete absence of any videos from the airports showing any passengers boarding the planes. I decided to see what I could find. There is a lot of info on this topic, but the ultimate disposition of it is debated.</p>

<p>So there is no possible final and completely conclusive answer as to where the passengers went, there has been a lot of hard work, and deep digging by people and pilots, and subsequent partial conclusions. One solid one pertains to a Delta Flight having all of the passengers from the two flights that actually were recorded as taking off being quarantined at the Cleveland Airport. This much is been concluded with diligence.</p>

<p>From here, we don&#39;t know what happened.... whether some were killed, or some were made up, or if some were offered new lives and compensation....it&#39;s hard to imagine. But it doesn&#39;t sound as grisly as we have been suggesting here in this thread.</p>

<p>Start with this article (below), then search for &quot;9/11 Passengers&quot; and read the first forum post that comes up at &quot;letsrollforums.com&quot;...keep going if you care to after that and post if you want to share...This whole passenger issue is a really interesting area.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a great video...had not seen that before. The sad thing is, it doesn&#39;t stand well on its own to the dumbest of sheeple because in my experience, you have to explain to them why Building 7 matters; how its controlled demolition destroys the whole official narrative of the Twin Towers destruction.</p>

<p>But I like it because it is more <strong>conclusive</strong> (not circumstantial) then the other 4 minute classic from 5 years ago by Michael Corbett called <em>9/11, A Conspiracy Theory</em> which is still great, if only for it&#39;s sarcastic and scathing presentation. Plus, it was really the first of its kind (despite the date of upload, I remember seeing it in early 2009). EDIT: maybe not...because it has info about the SEAL raid of Osama...And that was 2011 I think.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure everyone has seen the video I refer to, but just in case:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rumsfeld and Bush were both out of the loop during the attacks while they should&#39;ve been making decisions on whether to shoot down flights 77 and 93. Even if you buy the official narrative how can you not be furious at these clowns? Why was Bush allowed by secret service to sit in the school? He knew America was under attack before going into the classroom. Letting Bush read about goats put himself and the whole school in danger. While the FAA is freaking out about several possible hijackings (thanks a lot war games/radar blips) our commander in chief is reading to children where itwas known he would be for days in advance.</p>

Its remarkable more people don&#39;t care about the war games - they perfectly hindered any chance at shooting down the planes. What are the odds on 9/11 that most of our air defense are away from the northeast, some are participating in hijacked airplane drills, and radar screens are filled with fake hijacks that screwed up the response time of the only fighters we did have?</p>

<p>And of course, it lacks that oh-so-elusive pot of gold that truthers have been searching for: evidence</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really. </p>

<p><em>The New Pearl Harbor</em> is essentially 6 hours of <em>circumstantial</em> evidence.  You&#39;ve never heard that word, obviously, so I highly recommend you look it up and read about it.  You&#39;ll find that - surprise! - there is more than one category of &quot;evidence&quot;.</p>

<p>No &quot;truther&quot; that I&#39;ve ever met expects to find a handwritten letter, in blood, from Dick Cheney himself, outlining all involvement in 9/11 by the U.S. government.  &quot;Truthers&quot; are well aware that the <em>direct</em> evidence is long gone.  They are also well aware of the fact that <em>destroying evidence/tampering with evidence is fundamental to a successful cover-up</em>.</p>

<p>Conspiratards like to pretend that there is a &quot;lack of evidence&quot; to support the claims of &quot;truthers&quot;, when that couldn&#39;t be any further from the truth.  There are <em>mountains of circumstantial evidence</em> that plainly suggest there is much more to the story than the official version of events; mountains of reasons why the official story does not make logical sense and should be rejected.</p>

<p>And before anyone attempts to discount circumstantial evidence or suggest that it is neither acceptable nor admissible in a court of law, keep in mind that Timothy McVeigh was convicted of a terrorist act primarily on <em>circumstantial evidence</em>.  Truthers may not have <em>direct evidence</em> at their disposal, but that only matters to anti-truth conspiratards who simply don&#39;t understand &quot;evidence&quot;.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstantial_evidence#Validity_of_circumstantial_evidence">Validity of circumstantial evidence</a></p>

<p>A popular misconception is that circumstantial evidence is less valid or less important than direct evidence.[2][citation needed] This is only partly true: direct evidence is popularly, but mistakenly, considered more powerful. Many successful criminal prosecutions rely largely or entirely on circumstantial evidence, and civil charges are frequently based on circumstantial or indirect evidence. Much of the evidence against convicted American bomber Timothy McVeigh was circumstantial, for example. Speaking about McVeigh&#39;s trial, University of Michigan law professor Robert Precht said, &quot;Circumstantial evidence can be, and often is much more powerful than direct evidence.&quot; [3] The 2004 murder trial of Scott Peterson was another high-profile conviction based heavily on circumstantial evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, where&#39;s the evidence you ask?  Well, here&#39;s 6 fucking hours of it, in a well-organized documentary, complete with sources from both mainstream news and non-mainstream news, and everything in between.</p>

<p>correct.</p>

<p>at the very very least, those 19 cavemen had inside help from some group or faction.</p>

<p>is that credible, YES.</p>

<p>those 19 cavemen defeated NORAD and the whole of the North American defense network that day.</p>

<p>is that credible, NO.</p>

<p>&#39;but we were running drills doing the exact same scenario that the hijackers used that day...&#39;</p>

<p>is that credible or is that statistically likely, NO.</p>

<p>then theres the Anthrax link to Atta and one women who died in Florida, that blows the official story of the October Anthrax attacks out the water. or it was version 1 or 2 of the story, then the story changed...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly... here is more simple analogy. I have a pair of dice and tell you they are normal, and not weighted.</p>

<p>If I roll a 7 once, it means nothing as rolling a 7 has a probability of 1/6. You would believe that they are normal dice.</p>

<p>But what if I roll a 7 ten times in a row (the probability of which is &gt;1/60,000,000), how sure would you be that my dice are weighted? Given the odds, would you honestly have any doubt that I was lying? No. But your evidence that they are weighted is entirely circumstantial.</p>

<p>Look at each of the irregular/unusual events which happened on 9/11 as getting a 7 from a roll of dice. Now think of the probabilities of all those irregular/unusual events happening at the same time.</p>

<p>This is why I laugh at any <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> who says I am a &quot;coincidence theorist&quot;. All of the different anomalies aren&#39;t coincidences. No way in hell.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible you&#39;re <em>misinterpreting</em> the end of that phone call?</p>

<p>I&#39;m 37 years old and I&#39;ve never heard the expression &quot;it&#39;s a frame&quot; used in all my life.  It&#39;s certainly not a commonly used phrase.  The phone could be faintly picking up the voice of someone in the vicinity.  It could be static.  It could be crosstalk.  It could be the receiver brushing against her shirt and making a sound that resembles whispering.</p>

<p>Certainly nothing you&#39;d call &quot;pretty substantial&quot;.</p>
