<p>This post is about finding a few <strong>USEFUL</strong>, descriptive labels for persons who identify with the standard, given narrative.</p>

<p>There&#39;s really no such thing in our culture right now.  There&#39;s no <em>widely</em>-usable word or phrase that describes a person who believes the gov/media narrative presented to them.</p>

<p>If there was, that&#39;d be good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do see people get shut down all the time with those labels. And mostly, it&#39;s the people too &quot;noble&quot; to adopt those tactics themselves who end up getting shut down, while label-happy ignoramuses roll right over them. So, no, turning the other cheek is not a real solution. These terms are not falling into dis-use for the unwillingness of a few people to respond to them. If we could get a huge number of people to do that, it might be different, but I&#39;d like to hear how we do that. </p>

<p>So, I&#39;m not seeing a real solution here. Which means I&#39;m relegated to continuing with the one I&#39;ve mentioned. As are others. Unless you have a better idea...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a difference between accepting the standard narrative as the best possible description of what happened after skeptically researching the incident and just blindly believing the standard narrative no matter what.  That distinction is almost always lost in this forum, and the opinions of the former dismissed as if they were the latter.</p>

<p>Until that problem is fixed, and it is acknowledged that people can legitimately come to conclusions other than those presented as part of the conspiracy theory, it will be tough to have a substantive conversation about the incident between those two types of people.</p>

<p>Yes, there is a third type that blindly believes what they read, and I recognize that is what this post purports to be about.  But it is not possible to lump all people who disagree with an alternative theory into that group, and putting a name on it will not help in pushing good discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Busy person with a busy life.&quot; If the goal is to spread critical thinking, we have to resist the divisiveness and labling. </p>

<p>However, I actually embrace &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; when talking to people just because it&#39;s disarming to people and takes the sting out of the anti-critical-thinker propaganda. &quot;Well, I&#39;m kind of a conspiracy theorist, so, I really think...(insert some absolutely plausible theory that most critical thinkers, even mainstream news watchers, would agree is possible here)&quot;  And let&#39;s be honest, most of us here don&#39;t have anything too &quot;out there&quot; and most of the things we believe that are counter to what TV news is feeding has a good bit of documented proof, more documentation than what the Cable TV news is spewing, for sure. :(</p>

<p>I&#39;ve met like-minded thinkers who get really mad at me for using the label (I wouldn&#39;t use it if I knew they were like-minded thinkers before I shared my views, but you don&#39;t ever know who you&#39;re talking to). They say things like, &quot;You and I are not conspiracy theorists at all! We&#39;re critical thinkers!&quot; and I agree with them 100% -- however, people whose only news access is mainstream propaganda don&#39;t react the same way, and I think they then can take this label, this &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; and not apply it to some government-media-created boogeyman if you use it while taking to them...instead it reminds them of that person they had a pretty good and interesting conversation with and they&#39;ll be less likely to swallow the propaganda. They may not agree 100% and they may even get angry with you (man, don&#39;t talk to my father about Syria, haha), but they&#39;ll take a lot of what you say to heart and you&#39;ll learn a little, too, about where they&#39;re coming from.</p>

I&#39;ve noticed that when I discuss things unfolding in the world with some people they freeze up and shut down when I point out that it appears &quot;country x&quot; did this or that instead of sticking to mass media talking points. I give people the benefit of the doubt and ease it off for them, but it got me thinking, so I called my best friend who is NOT into conspiracy related research. I asked him if I was the &quot;crazy conspiracy theorist&quot; amongst people we know. He laughed and said &quot;yeah, but you&#39;ve also been about a month to a year ahead of all those people who think that. Why do you think I listen instead of telling you to shut up?&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy Theorist isn&#39;t a very useful term. It&#39;s use can be pejorative, but isn&#39;t always. It&#39;s just the best understood term we have to express the idea of a group of people inclined toward believe in a conspiracy or some conspiracies. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a problem with language.</p>

<p>Labeling isn&#39;t especially useful in either direction really.</p>

<p>The best term I can think of that is an accurate opposite to <em>Conspiracy Theorist</em> is <em>Conspiracy Skeptic</em> - I would say that is a useful descriptor, but perhaps it&#39;s not very pejorative if that&#39;s your aim?</p>

<p>If you can think of a better term than <em>Conspiracy Theorist</em> for, well, conspiracy theorists then maybe you could also take that approach? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh come on. Let&#39;s not be naive! This is about semantical labeling and frankly, no amount of skullduggery. Why should we play &quot;fair&quot; when it is a concept that others fail to even grasp? Please. This is exactly why they laugh at us, call us names and don&#39;t take &quot;conspiricists&quot; seriously. This IS a political battle with all the trimmings. If you are too frail, why join the battle? Gird your loins and expose the farcical illegitimacy of the those that hide behind veils of secrecy and deception! Call em out! Call them the pathetic, mindless lemmings that never grew up and only became food for the wolves, because if they cannot question and doubt and assert, that is what they are.</p>

With that said, many of the conspiracies in this subreddit need some careful examination too. I&#39;m tired of constant and repeated lies and nontruths being upvoted.

Carefully tread mate: you&#39;ll end up neck bearded in a basement with cheetos and forums for a life. No matter the conspiracy you buy: its not important to most. Sorry, but that&#39;s life.

<p>You are your ill toolers, masters, &amp; owners help.</p>

<p>You seek to label me &quot;schizophrenic&quot; for the same reason long ago language was continually seeded by the illete with babelish BS to label things like ancient Greek lyric LYRE playing oracle interpreters as LIARS to lay slander upon such more legitimately caring wandering ministering minstrel shepherds.  </p>

<p>What you label schizophrenia &quot;splitting of the mind&quot; exposes your fear of my full knowing the root assembly s<em>witch</em>es, marks, &amp; languages that build the many core programming languages the cause humans to not be mere mammalian animals. One must split the mind of duality &amp; re <em>craft</em> it fully spherical &amp; whole.</p>

<p>I am a disabled feral hermit self learned idiot savant. I have wisely feared all humans since birth &amp; began my school ending shall not learn from their untrustworthy teaching that led me to extreme truancy starting even before my kindergarten years. I know you are a schooled &amp; tooled child of the ill machine. I am not sure <strong>I hope you</strong> stay safe barking like a dog @ people you weakly attempt kick whilst crying &quot;schizophrenic&quot; to ill masters that have abandoned you unless they can milk &amp; bleed you.</p>

<p>if you&#39;ve seen a lot of crap on youtube you have a strange taste in film-making because the disinfo bullshit is easy to skip past. if you take in a ton of good information and are incapable of joining the quality dots in a logical manner there isn&#39;t much hope for you. don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re not alone.</p>

I got more. Point is, are you trying to educate others about what is really going on (that the media likes to downplay), or are you just another self-proclaimed genius babbling about secret cabals and bohemian groves and remote controlled airplanes who automatically converts any &quot;whatevs, dude&quot; in to a &quot;sigh, he just dosen&#39;t get it&quot; reaction superiority complex until you can retreat back to your echo chamber internet forum where everyone agrees and you can intelectually fellate each other like two bedbugs snug in your rug, queer for each other, the real world outside be damned?</p>

Any adult not capable of their own critical thinking and research who then instead accepts anything said to them by a perceived &quot;authority&quot; figure as fact or truthful is akin to an ignorant child. For instance, when a parent perpetuates a lie like Santa Claus for years, a child usually, up to a certain point, willfully believes what they were told as truthful. The child in this case is ignorant of the fact that Santa Claus is a fairy tale and put way too much stock into believing their perceived &quot;authority&quot; figures, the parents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Almost everything you write there could equally be written by skeptics about conspiracy theorists. That&#39;s clearly a matter of perspective. </p>

<p>The term Conspiracy Theorist basically has two uses - one is practical and useful; a term to broadly categorize people who are predisposed to a belief in conspiracy theories (or a conspiracy theory) - the other is less useful; a pejorative term used discredit or deride people based on their beliefs. </p>

<p>Unfortunately I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to practically separate them.</p>

<p>Why not focus on the content of what people say, rather than the words they use? If someone uses the term conspiracy theorist to disparage and dismiss you then you can simply ignore them and write it off if you want, but if they&#39;re using the term in a practically and logical way to try to reasonably engage in discussion then recognize that and either choose to engage or not, but recognize the use of the term for what it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I like where you&#39;re going here, but I think &quot;child&quot; isn&#39;t the right word because kids are so much smarter and such better searchers for truth than adults are.</p>

<p>For one thing, it&#39;s interesting to think about the lengths to which adults go to hide the truth from kids - once they know that a certain thing is not real, they spread it to all of their kid-friends! They never adamantly hold onto the lie, but instead share knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason why I used the term &quot;child&quot; is because they are more likely to be prone to look up to &quot;authority&quot; figures. It is in a child&#39;s nature to depend on their parents for survival. It should not be in an adult&#39;s nature to replace their parents with some other perceived &quot;authority&quot; figures. </p>

<p>In other words, I was not attempting to disparage children but instead attempting to describe how most adults have never truly become adults through age. Instead most adults tend to retain a child-like mindset where they look up to some perceived &quot;authority&quot; as necessary for their own survival. In turn most adults who have replaced their parents with some other perceived &quot;authority&quot; figure will likely accept anything told to them by their newly obtained parental figures as truthful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean you could call them sheep</p>

<p>But it&#39;d do you little good as those people probably will never believe the thing you said even if it was a rational thought. People tend to purposefully go against ideas that go against their core set of beliefs or ideas that would upset them to know to be true. </p>

<p>For example, if it turns out that an alien attack was responsible for 9/11, people would label it a conspiracy theory even if it&#39;s a reputable source. It would upset people to not only have been lied to by the government they know to be a nurturing provider of truth, but also that aliens were to blame. I believe it wouldn&#39;t even garner a second thought and most everyone would shrug the conclusion off as false.</p>

<p>I think there&#39;s a word for the act of going against the bitter truth but I don&#39;t know what it is. One of vote for an explanation! </p>
