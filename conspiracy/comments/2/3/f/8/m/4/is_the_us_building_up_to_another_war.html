<p>The military industrial complex is too big and powerful to willingly dismantle itself once it is no longer needed.  </p>

<p>When the last &quot;enemy&quot; is destroyed, the elite and state will redirect the war machine internally to quell dissidents, which it will call &quot;terrorists&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Disclaimer: I am not an economist.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The federal reserve creates 60-85 billion new dollars every month devaluing the dollars that you see having value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, it&#39;s called inflation and it&#39;s happening at <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=us+inflation+rate">about 1.5% per year</a>. That&#39;s not actually that much.</p>

<p>You say $60-85 billion like it&#39;s a lot, and to a normal person it is, but not compared to the total amount of money there is. Currently the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/Releases/h6/current/default.htm">M2 money supply of the US (cash, checking accounts, savings accounts, etc.) is about $10 trillion</a>, and there&#39;s still a lot of stuff that that doesn&#39;t measure. So per year, that&#39;s only a <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=85+billion+*+12+%2F+2+trillion">0.5%</a> increase in the total money supply.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How can you accurately determine how much value they actually have?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can&#39;t do it with 100% accuracy. You can&#39;t really do that with anything. That&#39;s fine though. The US dollar is quite stable, so it&#39;s pretty easy to get an accurate estimate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sure, they can be exchanged today to acquire goods and services but what happens when they stop? They will stop and it will happen very rapidly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you mean &quot;when they stop&quot;? When you can&#39;t exchange dollars for goods and services? What makes you think that will happen (anytime soon)? What makes you think it will go quickly?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I agree we can look around and see all sorts of similar monetary systems that are doing fine</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not just &quot;fine&quot;, but fine <em>without wars</em>. Your whole argument was that the entire economy is based around war. Clearly, and you seem to agree, there are other economies very similar to ours that are fine, <em>and they&#39;re not at war</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but can you show me an old one? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, not totally sure what you mean? An old money system? Like bartering, which would be completely impractical in our economy?</p>

<p>I&#39;m also curious what <em>you</em>, personally, think would be a better alternative to what we have now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire Iraq/Aghanistan war has only ever been for the US to control oil (and thus control China&#39;s economy) and control the Soviet Union&#39;s former territories to ensure Russia remains in a weakened state. But now China is building thorium power plants and Russia is starting to absorb Crimea and Ukraine the US needs to change tactics.</p>

<p>This &quot;new&quot; upcoming war is just a continuation of the only war the US has ever been in. It needs to ensure it stays the world&#39;s only true superpower whatever the cost.</p>
