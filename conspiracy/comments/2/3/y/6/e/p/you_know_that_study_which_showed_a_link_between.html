<p><strong>Sources of Funding:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Financial support was provided by the French InterMinisterial Mission for the Fight Against Drugs and Addiction (MILDT, Mission interministérielle de lutte contre les drogues et toxicomanies), and by the French drug agency (ANSM, Agence Nationale de Sécurité des Médicaments).</strong> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The study design also makes no sense at all. They looked at a database of health complications reportedly related to drug use over a 5 year period, 2, 000 of which (only 3% of the total database) were <em>reportedly</em> related to marijuana complications. </p>

<p>Only 35 of the reported marijuana related health problems were cardiovascular complications (2%). 21 of those people who had heart complications also smoked tobacco, most of them heavily. Many of them had other health problems associated with higher risk for heart problems, and the association between marijuana and the cardiovascular complications is completely speculative in the first place.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really a worthless study, doesn&#39;t tell you anything. In fairness, though, marijuana does increase your heart rate, so logically if you already have heart problems you&#39;re probably at a higher risk for a heart attack if you smoke. But it&#39;s the same for sex or exercise -- if you have heart problems you&#39;re at higher risk for a heart attack during those activities too.</p>

<p>Even the researchers themselves note; &quot;The 35 cases described must be compared with the 1.2 million regular [marijuana] users in France&quot;</p>

<p>As someone who has been to Paris, I can say that EVERYONE smokes cigarettes in France, well most everyone.  They practically hand out packs of cigarettes to tourists at the airport.  </p>

<p><em>If you hate cigarette smoke and you are going to Paris France, you are gonna have bad time.</em></p>

<p>Plus, pot smokers in Europe tend to mix their weed with tobacco. </p>

<p>But MJ is also a vasodilator. So it increases your heart rate and dilates your blood vessels. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong. I&#39;m no doctor. But doesn&#39;t the VD effect counter any negative cardiovascular effects. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup.  Inhaling burnt paper or burnt dried tobacco leafs is not good for the lungs.  For this <em>study</em> to be more scientific they should only look at edible Marijuana.  Or only Marijuana users who smoke out bongs/glass.  And Marijuana users who only smoke weed, not combined with tobacco.</p>
