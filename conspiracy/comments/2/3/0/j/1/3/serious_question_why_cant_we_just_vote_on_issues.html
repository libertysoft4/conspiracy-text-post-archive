        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I understand the reasoning behind the current democratic system&#39;s creation. But our modern society has advanced to a point that finally makes it possible to hear the voice of every citizen. What would America be like if it were ACTUALLY run by the will of the people for the people, and not by out of touch politicians who oftentimes put themselves ahead of the needs of their country?</p>

<p>These politicians get elected by promising change to citizens who feel powerless in a confusing and corrupt system. It&#39;s commonplace and expected that politicians will say one thing and do another. Lying to voters is so standard that it&#39;s not even taken seriously anymore, now it&#39;s a joke. </p>

<p>So why do we need them? Why do we need people to &quot;represent&quot; us? Instead of putting names on ballot sheets, why not put choices and issues that are only implemented with a majority vote? If we have ATM machines on every block, why not voting booths? </p>

<p>The current system of politics is outdated and unorganized and we can&#39;t even trust the politicians to follow through on their word. </p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s cause we don&#39;t trust ourselves to make the right decisions. Maybe we think the majority of us aren&#39;t educated enough to guide the nation. But it&#39;s clear that too much power has concentrated into too few hands and Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely. Maybe it&#39;s time we started trusting each other to do the right thing, rather than hoping a hero in Washington will swoop in and save us all. </p>

<p>What do you guys think?   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks dude - This is super helpful and informative. </p>

<p>The page does bring a lot into perspective. 
&quot;Direct democracy was not what the framers of the United States Constitution envisioned for the nation. They saw a danger in majorities forcing their will on minorities&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s a good point. There needs to be protection for minorities. </p>

<p>&quot;Pure democracy cannot subsist long nor be carried far into the departments of state – it is very subject to caprice and the madness of popular rage.&quot; - John Witherspoon </p>

<p>This is also a good point. The public opinion is easily swayed by sentiment and emotion.  </p>

<p>There are certainly downsides, maybe not a system as drastic as full direct democracy. But if the people had more of a voice we probably wouldn&#39;t be seeing instances like what&#39;s currently going on in at the BUNDY RANCH. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really think our problem is direct versus representative democracy, or that our problem is purely the political system. I think a representative system could work if it was just as easy for a farmer or teacher to participate in the political process as it is for an investment banker or oil company executive.</p>

<p>When you have people with the power to buy a cable news company and control the debate, <em>no</em> kind of democracy will work. Decentralizing wealth is the only way to decentralize power.</p>

Reddit could be used as a good test model, something similar that allowed politically active people to weigh the pros and cons and make an informative vote. Having an executor instead of an executive. Someone that could only act on the peoples will. they would be chosen at random with specific instructions on what to do. Severe penalties for not following the rules, and such. The internet age is perfect for such an idea, as it has never really been tested with todays tech. sorry thinking outloud...</p>

<p>Look into Kropotkin&#39;s work, especially &#39;Mutual Aid&#39;, Emma Goodman, Hakem Bey (ask for more if you&#39;d like) </p>

<p>Every political structure has shown those with power exploit it one way or another. (Communism, socialism, democracy, all names for the same thing) The only way to have a completely uncorrupted system requires decision making power to be equally distributed. </p>

<p>This, of course, requires an educated populace. </p>

<p>There is an old Confucius quote that says &#39;the purpose of the government is to make itself obsolete.&#39; Because it teaches the people to govern themselves. Our western world does the opposite, raising dependent children into dependent adults. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really like what you&#39;re saying here. </p>

<p>That&#39;s an excellent point. The key is education. I&#39;m sure the majority of Americans agree that a strong education system needs to be a priority, but it currently receives less than 3% of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/2013-taxreceipt">Federal Tax Receipt</a> and tests show students are performing <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/how-us-students-compare-internationally/2013/12/02/7183ad9c-5ba8-11e3-bf7e-f567ee61ae21_graphic.html">comparatively lower</a> than other developed nations. </p>

<p>And the rising cost in higher education is certainly getting out of hand. </p>

<p>So a better educated populace would be more equipped to handle the responsibilities of self government, however a better education is difficult to attain under the current system. Something&#39;s gotta give. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to plug my idea for an opt-in scalable representative democracy:</p>

<p>A piece of legislation gathers signatures to come to a referendum.</p>

<p>You can choose to vote directly on the legislation, not vote at all, or you can &quot;give&quot; your vote to a trusted third party. This third party can be a friend of yours, a family member, or a politician, or a celebrity, a philosopher, a historian, a scientist. That third party then has the option to use the vote, opt out, or transfer it to another person who <em>they</em> trust.</p>

<p>So you have 5 friends and 4 of them don&#39;t really care about politics, so the 5th can be given their votes, now she has 5 votes. She can use them directly or transfer them to someone else.</p>

<p>To prevent fraud anyone casting more than, say, two hundred votes would have to make their voting record public.</p>

<p>Edit: to expand, this would be a nuanced system ideally accessible from people&#39;s mobile devices. Referendi would be tagged based on the issue, environmental, foreign affairs, economic, whatever. You could divide your representatives so I have Dan Carlin casting my foreign policy votes, and Kucinich on domestic policy maybe.</p>

<p>An important element of this system is that you cannot refuse the responsibility of having a vote transferred to you, you can choose not to vote, but you can&#39;t turn down the responsibility.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a true shame that the difficulties of today&#39;s voting system keeps a significant portion of the populace from weighing in on issues. A higher voter turnout, resulting from a more convenient system, might make a huge difference on the politics of today. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a short excerpt from an essay I was working on. Also, Im telling every high school kid that wants to use what I wrote for their essay that if you do you will get caught if your teacher uses plagiarism checking software. </p>

<p>The dual system of direct democracy and representative democracy was initially intended to prevent law makers from abusing the established system and creating unnecessary laws that do more harm for the common citizen than good. However, the nature of modern politics has rendered the use of direct initiatives as a system for use funded by politicians’ campaigns and special interest groups. Direct initiatives, also known as propositions, only require a simple majority rule to become law unless the proposition concerns the issue of raising taxes of which a two-thirds super majority must vote for the bill.  The passage of Proposition 13 in June 1978 reduced the property tax for homeowners and represents successful use of direct democracy by the citizens (18). However, direct democracy does not always represent the entire opinion of California due to the lack of voter turnout. Laws passed through direct democracy can also have a negative outcome for the state even if the majority of voters agree with the proposition. This can result due to lack of foresight by voters who demand immediate remedies to the issues at hand and also because propositions cannot be corrected and critiqued like legislation by the governing bodies. (39). </p>

<p>The dual system of democracy is a paradoxical element in Californian government that ultimately prevents proper management of the citizens’ needs. Although voters need to choose elected officials in order to make the state run, they also have established many restrictions on legislators and the power they have to create change. For example, budget restrictions limit the amount of money that can be utilized for certain programs. Of the 209 billion dollar budget in 2012, 35% of the overall budget remains fixated for education and 28.5% for Health and human services (104). More than half the budget has already been utilized, and with additional commitments on the budget, this leaves little funding for politicians to use to fix key issues.  California is politically and economically dynamic, but the denomination of state revenue remains static. This money can be budgeted differently every fiscal year so that the main problems that California faces can be remedied.  Minor tax increases, until the deficit is repaid, would be a viable short-term solution, but the super majority rule prevents taking this avenue to increase state revenue. Californians choose to pay lesser taxes in the short run, while still forcing an enlarged budget that cannot satisfy public demand. The government, over the course of time, becomes underfunded and will go into a deficit (145). </p>

<p>In addition to the paradoxical policies plaguing legislative power in the Californian government, California has and will continue to have an ever-increasing population (from 38 million in 2012 to 50 million by 2025). The increase in population affects demand for housing, state highways, schools, and prisons, negatively resulting in inflated costs for these necessities. Due to this inflation, the Californian government’s budget will not be able to provide these public commodities at the rate needed. This further worsens issues regarding housing, traffic congestion, student’s performance within schools, and costs to maintain an increasing prison population. (145-146). 
The reason why the cost of living in California continues to stay high even with the economy in shambles falls back to the simple economic principle of supply and demand. Many people want to stay in California, but the amount of real estate available is not enough to satisfy the supply, which results in higher prices for the houses that are available. However, if legislation is put into effect to order the creation of new homes and low-cost public housing in underdeveloped areas, then the value of surrounding homes will decrease slightly but this will also generate revenue for the state via taxes. On the individual level, those that are affected by the decrease in the value of their homes will react negatively towards the creation of more housing and may want to repeal the act. However, in the long-term, California will see larger gaps between rich and poor and increased rates of homelessness because the cost of living in California will be much higher. If California is able to build more homes at a steady rate that does not affect the rates of property value too heavily then this may be a possible solution to the rise in population. However, with increased homes come an increasing number of vehicles due to the large distances between locations of interest that many Californians enjoy.</p>

<p>California’s roads are over utilized with almost 50,000 miles of road due to reach the end of its life. With 7.4 billion dollars being spent annually on repairs, the lack of new innovation for new transport will create problems for travel, tourism, and will negatively affect the environment. Due to the enormous size of the state, it is a requirement to possess an automobile in order to move locations in California. With only 5% of the state participating in public transit, California has the potential to become a breeding ground for respiratory illness by 2025 if conditions are not improved regarding forms of travel. The main issue in dealing with public transit is to defeat special interest groups that lobby to put a stop to public transit because it will negatively impact car sales. Once this issue has been overcome, California may move in a more progressive and green direction (147). However, even with the creation of a form of public transportation, there will still be a rise in car sales due population increase that will impact the efficiency of highways. To counter this, Californians will need to allow the governing body the power to allocate funds towards building more efficient highway systems that are able to stand the tests of nature and time.  </p>

<p>By 2025 the majority of Californians will consist of Latinos, and with the Latino population’s continuous decline in graduation rates and test scores, California’s future may include an education gap which may lead to gaps in the socioeconomic agenda. Long-term effects may include homelessness and increased crime rates, which will further result in the decreased availability of funds to our government. The lack of infrastructure for schooling has set California on a path for socioeconomic disaster. If the costs for education cannot be subsidized, those families that operate on base-line poverty will not be able to have educated children, which will result in multiple generations of unproductivity, which is ultimately bad for GDP.  Additionally, if the population is not educated, then the passing of legislation may not be fully understood and legislators may try to take advantage of the system or through direct democracy a vote on a proposition by the uneducated may effect them negatively.  The lack of education and socioeconomic disparity will lead to desperation for food and money that will give rise to an increase in crime (147-149).</p>

<p>Currently, 15.7 billion dollars every year is placed in the budget to treat criminals in California. On average, the upkeep costs for a single prisoner is approximately 40,000 dollars. If the amounts of prisoners increase, then a larger portion of our tax dollars will be used in ways that will never benefit the common good of the average citizen. Either the cost of incarceration needs to be heavily decreased or the laws that place individuals in jail for petty crimes need to be revisited and amended in order to decrease the amount of money being spent each year on criminals. By keeping people out of prison, there will be an increase in the demand for jobs and with proper legislation jobs have the potential to be created and revenue earned (145).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But democracy in any form is &quot;mob rule&quot;.  </p>

<p>Despite all of the lip service paid to it... a democracy is not a very good political system.  But that is why you hear two terms in politics... REPUBLICans and DEMOCRATs.  We were conceived as a Republic (which contains elements of a democracy) but it is the features of the being a Republic that make it the most beneficial for everyone.</p>

<p><em>A democracy is nothing more than mob rule, where 51% of the people may take away the rights of the other 49%.</em> —Thomas Jefferson</p>

<p><em>Democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their death.</em> —James Madison</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it allows it but after this enlightenment period is over, the majority may choose <em>not</em> to oppress the minority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True an I cannot deny the existence of technology that bridges the gaps between the technical then-and-nows.</p>

<p>So then the question becomes what would be a proper way of synergizing the power derived from technological connectivity of the people with the power of elected representation? Somewhere somebody is going to be doing something for many people, an lets not forget the amazingly built fundamentals that got us here in the first place an still work today. </p>

<p>Of course this is just an observation of our abstract speaking so no argument really intended. Even in the wild the dead are not neglected, if one were to take a perspective of our previous to current myriad systems ending their life span it would be foolish to deem them unworthy of proper observation even if just out of humanic respect. </p>

<p>So, since we are socially not at a point where we can feasibly educate our populations to collectively run a state in a generation or two there is still promise in lower forms of infrastructure being made highly efficient with the idea. </p>

<p>But then we come down to oppression of the minority, again. The amount of people required to run even the higher forms of local government still is and will become smaller with each figurative advancement through implementation of sustained efficiency knowledge growth interval. So while the majority of people would probably like to &quot;take their jobs&quot; and replace the whole thing with something better and more efficient, they want to keep their jobs they spent their life achieving and protect the very idea of it in the first place, which is also honorable and respectable. </p>

<p>Eventually, after a bunch of bullshit is written we just get down to the eventual outcome of any discussion dealing with making society more efficient. Efficiency kills jobs and we never gave a shit until it became a problem that we have become so damn good at everything, even if its just the amount of people required to run a fast food chain.</p>

Sadly a commander in chief is required, and many many bureaucrats to carry out the business decided on by democratic vote. So in my hypothetical pure democracy the people vote on every law, but there are still elected and non-elected government employees as needed.</p>

<p>These representatives would be more like code-enforcers than decision makers, like policemen not congressmen.</p>

My other strong belief is in self-government. People should be able to determine their fates locally, as individuals of a community they can feel a part of. Not as subjects of some distant autocratic entity.

<p>And no one&#39;s to say we wouldn&#39;t still have the opportunity to be educated on each major decision. Politicians are presented with briefings for each of their decisions before they commit. We could still have leaders for people to get behind, people who are qualified. </p>
