    <div class="md"><p>No, if you are a responsible service provider and you use SSL and you use OpenSSL (if you are are a responsible service provider YOU USE SSL site-wide; not necessarily OpenSSL), you updated your openssl version and rotated your SSL key and told users about the flaw. </p>

<p>Reddit is irresponsible in that it&#39;s 2014 and they STILL can&#39;t manage site-wide SSL. But they&#39;re responsible in that they realized that they do use OpenSSL on their servers and use SSL (god, i hope) when they accept your password, if not your session key) and they updated their version of OpenSSL and rotated their SSL keys and told everyone about it. If you logged out and in again during the likely 4-12 hours they were vulnerable with your password (i.e., not with a session key, which is likely vulnerable...all the time...), there&#39;s a remote possibility that someone using the exploit might get your password...but the likelihood is really, really remote. </p>

<p>Do you have any proof that specific accounts were hacked? And that they were hacked using heartbleed? (Of all the things to use to glean individual account credentials, that&#39;s just silliness - for Reddit, running a cracker like John the Ripper with a good password list or just sitting in a coffee shop or university sniffing traffic would be faster and more effective.)</p>

<p>That does not mean that someone stole your password using the heartbleed flaw and used it to log in and shill. It&#39;s so much easier just to guess your password, ESPECIALLY SINCE PRETTY MUCH NO ONE EVEN ACCESSES REDDIT USING SSL BECAUSE REDDIT SUCKS AT PROVIDING USERS WITH BASIC SECURITY.</p>

<p>You&#39;re more exposed by the fact that Reddit is not secure at all than you are by this specific bug. Not to say that this bug isn&#39;t a big fucking deal - it is - just not to Reddit, which was never really all that secure to begin with.</p>

<p>I&#39;m done arguing with you because obviously you are too fragile and butthurt to do some basic research to back up your ridiculous theory - so fine, it&#39;s true: the magic heartbleed fairies stole your passwords and they&#39;re shilling under your account name and Reddit even admitted to it by being precautionary and asking you to change your password like every other affected web site did!

<p>I see.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You were reported for allegedly harassing this user. After reviewing your post history, I see I was in error in regards to the &quot;shill&quot; accusations, having mistaken you for another user who had made similar statements.</p>

<p>Still, I see two seperate instances, in another thread, wherein you attacked this particular user. I also see he attacked you once in response. All offenses were removed and you were both warned prior, accordingly. </p>

<p>So, I&#39;m going to have to ask that you simply avoid attacking other users, in general. </p>

<p>In regards to the post above:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Says the person who has been a Redditor for six days.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>isn&#39;t quite a violation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m glad you confess we shouldn&#39;t take you seriously either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>could be a violation but is so minor I&#39;m going to leave it, and again just ask that you refrain from attacking other users as you had prior, in another thread, and suggest (not demand, but ask) that you and the other user simply avoid interacting with one another if possible, as you clearly can&#39;t seem to agree on much and one or the other appears to typically escalate the situation unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Thank you for understanding. </p>
