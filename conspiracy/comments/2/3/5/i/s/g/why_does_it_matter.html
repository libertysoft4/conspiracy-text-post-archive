        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve always been a tad confused about something with regards to conspiracy theories and those who are intensely concerned with them. Why exactly does it matter to you, or in the long run at all? If the United States/Western World at large is controlled by a global conspiracy, and always has been, why is it of any real concern? All that means is that the standard previous behavior of human beings is still prevailing today - its in our nature to exist in totalitarian systems (dictatorship, monarchy, tribal chiefdom, etc.) --- so what exactly is the big deal if we haven&#39;t advanced beyond that? Are you mad at being lied to and told that you have &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;a vote&quot; ? Leaders have always lied to their subjects. All in all, being concerned with conspiracy theories, to me, simply seems like an escapist delusion - one dedicated to the fantasy notion that if we aren&#39;t already &quot;free&quot; then somehow doing something differently will magically erase the human drive to power and create a &quot;free&quot; society..... As people who regularly browse this reddit, maybe you can give me an answer to this; Why does it matter if your being spied on and lied to? Is something about your life uncomfortable and miserable that you need to blame the government for your failings? What is it that makes you so concerned?</p>

<p>Yes, because I have the right to choice &amp; belief.

<p>Well, it&#39;s my personal opinion that those in the highest of these positions are abusing their power, &amp; ultimately their actions do have bearings on everyone below them, my involvement is to simply stay informed, speak my mind, &amp; consider <em>all</em> opinions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Taking serious time to consider <em>all</em> opinions is frankly a waste of time and resources. In the day and age that we are in, with widespread access to the publishing technology known as the internet, its very easy to come up with opinions whether based in reality or not. We live in an era where the truth is subjective, so seeking it out is sort of pointless and archaic. You can&#39;t find the complete and unadulterated truth when the world is full of competing interests manufacturing evidence to support their points in an effort to be right. Pragmatics are all that&#39;s left and in my opinion, it is entirely not pragmatic to concern one&#39;s self with any aspect of government other than those that <strong>directly</strong> effect one&#39;s self (i.e. knowing if something you are doing or want to do is illegal or not).</p>

In any regards, your explanation to my question seems the most reasonable, you are simply curious, when it comes down to it.

<p>Not true. Lack of research does not mean it is good for you. GMO foods are invasive. The fact that don&#39;t let you choose whether you want GMO or not, shows that they already know what people would pick. Pharm drugs are usually more dangerous than we understand now. </p>

<p>Hahahaha! I&#39;ve worked in behavioral health all my life and the reason there are more cases of depression and autism is because up until about the past 20 years, almost everyone was hateful and adverse to psychiatric/psychological treatment. We still have this same problem today - people weren&#39;t diagnosed with autism before because their parents just called them a retard and beat them... and they weren&#39;t diagnosed with depression before because they were too afraid to admit what they were dealing with. That&#39;s like saying agencies that report on murder rates cause the numbers of murders to go up because before they started recording it there weren&#39;t any recorded murders.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>FYI, the smog factor in most places in the US has been decreasing due to state laws an initiatives to reduce emissions. Also, global warming isn&#39;t a thing - its climate change and the government you think is conspiring to cause it is the source of laws trying to slow it down - we don&#39;t live in China. As for the ozone layer - that&#39;s 100% the fault of developing countries - CFCs, the cause of that, have been banned in all of Europe, the US, Canada and Mexico -- its the Chinese government and other stupid developing nations that aren&#39;t giving a fuck.</p>

<p>First of all... most of the things about global warming and effects of smog are highly debatable. Secondly, it is not 100% the fault of the developing countries - we had our share of destroying the planet and we didn&#39;t give a shit. Now they feel like its their turn, and we are all of sudden telling them not to do the same things we did... even though our economy highly benefited from it and that&#39;s what made us developed. So obviously they don&#39;t want to listen to us. It is our fault for not having studied it before we used it when we did in the past, and not all on them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The government would have no interest in putting people who do nothing  against it into FEMA/concentration camps. If REX 84 were to be enacted as a real thing, then only people who are running around on conspiracy websites talking about rebellion are going to end up in FEMA camps, not people who mind their own business and go on with their life. Here&#39;s a prime example; the Stasi didn&#39;t torture or arrest people in East germany who didn&#39;t go out to protests or try to escape over the wall - everyone who appreciated what they had and didn&#39;t try to attack the government was left alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My last sentence is complete fact; I am an avid collector of East German memorabilia and have studied East germany at the university level. The very fact that you said &quot;Russian or German&quot; history when referring to East Germany leads me to believe you aren&#39;t very well informed on the subject of East German politics, culture and history. The Stasi utilized a combination of spying, imprisonment, and what was known as the zersetzung (german for &quot;decomposition&quot;) technique to target those deemed as subversives; and such people all did something that made them get labeled as subversives - they watched western media, communicated with western foreigners, actively spoke against the government, plotted to escape, assisted escapees, etc. --- Governments never have an interest in randomly declaring people who have not done something against their interest subversives - for example, everyone on the FBI ADEX list had done something to get on there - it may have been small, like protesting certain government actions - but they still did something to get on there. People who have no problem with a government do not get targeted unless that government is based on racism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t need to be part of the ruling class to live life comfortably; you simply need to not antagonize/attack the ruling class. We don&#39;t live in serfdom times, we live in modern times where its actually a lot easier and cheaper to make human beings comfortable. Like in East Germany, those who were supportive of the system were provided with comfort, despite not actually being part of the ruling class (i.e. not being in political positions, high ranking party positions, or high ranking positions in the NVA and Stasi).</p>

<p>If you were a run-of-the-mill citizen in the DDR (Deutsche Demokratische Republik), who did their job and never made much of a fuss, you were rewarded. You were given a decent salary (which could buy you whatever you wanted including soft drinks and alcohol), a free home, free water, free electric. You were free to go to clubs and party with friends, and you were protected from injury by free state healthcare. It was those who were so bad at their jobs that in a capitalist system they&#39;d be fired - who were assigned to the dilapidated homes that had rats and had to use a hose to get their clean water inside.... but even they were able to get food and healthcare, they just had dirtier, older homes.</p>

I am not really asking why people are curious, I fully understand curiosity, as I said in conversing with Canadian_POG up above; its those who have a rebellion outlook when it comes to this stuff that I&#39;m actually confused about. I&#39;m trying to ask if there&#39;s any group of people who are as intensely concerned as some of the people here are that aren&#39;t actively experiencing paranoia and/or delusion.... and if so, what is making them get to the point that they are at, why are they so focused on a philosophical position that they are willing to risk themselves and their comforts for it?</p>

The majority of people I have met concerned with this stuff were psychotic or experiencing paranoid personality disorder. Also, if you really studied psychology, you need to go back to school - because your understanding of projection is archaic and Freudian -- Freud&#39;s theories have been discredited by nearly every contemporary school of thought - the real route of projection is the false-consensus tendency -- its not a denial of a trait in one&#39;s self but a conscious recognition of a trait in one&#39;s self that is assumed to be true about others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In response to some of the &quot;why does a slave want to be free&quot; responses to what I said, I&#39;d like to say this. The majority of serfs had no intentions of &quot;being free&quot;, it wasn&#39;t until the bourgeois/trader class decided they wanted to live like kings that serfdom began to end. A slave, historically, has been someone who was denied the basic needs of life; that is forced to work with no benefit from said work. Regardless of whether or not we are spied on, or our government is controlled by a shadow government - we, unlike slaves, are comfortable, provided we take a measure of what we have. Even the poorest of people in this country, speaking as someone whose been there and who has worked to help such people, have access to food (foodstamps and food pantries), shelter (homeless shelters, work programs, etc.), clean water (basically free at any public water fountain), some degree of medical care (mandatory emergency room treatment, medicaid, medicare). So, I ask again, considering you have everything to make your life comfortable and the opportunity to find even more things to satiate your desires for entertainment and comfort; why does it matter what our leaders do?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tax slavery and wage slavery are two different concepts. You do have the opportunity, however, to rise above both of them. You have the opportunity to become wealthy enough to pay someone to get you every tax loophole available to the point where you barely pay anything or are refunded everything that you do pay. Just look at GE. Genetically modified organisms are just as natural as anything that isn&#39;t - we&#39;ve been manipulating the genetics of plants since the dawn of agriculture through selective breeding. The only reason any GMO is bad is because of particular bad business practices. Monsanto is not a good company, that doesn&#39;t mean GMOs are all bad; Genentech makes wonderful GMO foods that are actually BETTER for you than organics. Also, organic farming has a greater impact ecologically - it requires more land for the same food yield, and uses plant based pesticides that encourage the evolution of more virulent pests (i.e. excessive pyrethin use leading to pyrethin-resistant bugs).</p>

<p>So your solution is to chase your way through the system, so that you can continue to cheat the system and the hard working people like the rich already do? Do you really think I would side that? I do have a heart you know and I am not a psychopath. Besides this &quot;become rich so you can do things&quot; is what makes the world how it is now. It is not working above the system, it is doing what everyone else is already trying to do.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not true. There is only certain extent to which we can modify things naturally. GM allows you even greater freedom to switch things around, and we can&#39;t claim that the effects are going to be the same in the end. We don&#39;t have the research to make that claim. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Monsanto is not a good company, that doesn&#39;t mean GMOs are all bad; Genentech makes wonderful GMO foods that are actually BETTER for you than organics</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do hate monsanto but that&#39;s not my only thing against GM products. First, things have to be well researched before it is used publicly - that&#39;s just basic scientific approach to new found things. Secondly, people should be given the choice. Label it. It isn&#39;t ask for much. Why worry so much if it is good for you?</p>

<p>There is a difference between what is &quot;good for you&quot; and what is &quot;good for profit&quot;. There is a big difference between the two. Even though there is a lot of common ground, that doesn&#39;t mean it is the same exact goal. </p>

<p>GM pesticides cause other plants to die and prevent all sorts of animals from eating it. That to me is scarier than regular pesticides and their harm. Regular evolution along with pesticides is expected because that&#39;s how nature works. They adapt to pressures of the environment. </p>

<p>Yet, this is the first time I am hearing this argument. If instead of arguing against GMO labeling completely, they could have made it known that they just want to put in more detail than just a label - then that would be great. I have no issue against it. Make that known, instead of fighting against GMO labels completely. However, this doesn&#39;t seem like what they are arguing against publicly at all. So do you mind citing this claim of yours?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, organic farming, even ignoring pesticides has a greater ecologically impact - it destroys more wild habitats by requiring more land for lesser yields.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ecologically impact of using old farming methods is not going to be anything beyond controllable. Secondly, there is enough yield to feed people and the idea of this &quot;over populated&quot; planet thing is not really based on facts. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s frankly rather idiotic, the levels at which people ignore the fact that organic food producers are themselves linked to and operating with multinational corporations and running their own special interest lobby, just like Monsanto does.</p>

<p>Then fight that part. Make it known that you want to put more information in, rather than take all information out. People won&#39;t fight that. I find it hard to believe that since you are the only person who has argued that before. </p>
