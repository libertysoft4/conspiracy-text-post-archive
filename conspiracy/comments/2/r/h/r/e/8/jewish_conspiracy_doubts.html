    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m still pretty open to the idea.  I think that the prevalence of the idea is aided by isreals dominance of America&#39;s political scene, which is, quite honestly, statistically obscene.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you have to believe &quot;Jews are ebul&quot; just to look at the facts and realize they have a strong grasp on American government and media.</p>

<p>Just to kick the hornets nest: in order to explain jewish dominance in the worlds political, financial, and media scene you are obligated to be an &quot;Ebul racist&quot;.  There is no other reconciliation of reality.</p>

<p>I&#39;m certainly not proposing as certainty Jews are evil or or trying to dominate the world, but statistically speaking there is no other coherent explanation for their domininance of the aformentioned arenas of power.</p>

<p>To put it succinctly: there is either <em>demonstrable difference in general intelligence between the races</em> or <em>we are arbitrarily ruled by Jews.</em></p>

<p>Demonstrably yes and obviously not, but there is a third explanation as to why a distinct group can achieve disproportionate level of power and wealth, and the freemasons are the most obvious example. </p>

<p>If part of your &quot;duty&quot; as a freemason is to covertly assist other freemasons at the expense of non-freemasons then, as a group, you can achieve disproportionate influence over time. Freemasons give each other business, hire and promote other freemasons to key positions in organisations, ignore and cover-up fraud and other crimes committed by fellow Lodge members (in the case of masons within the police or the judiciary), help pass legislation that suits other freemasons etc etc.</p>

<p>In the UK there are multiple official and unofficial &quot;networks&quot; that operate. It is easier to get a lucrative job in the City if you have family connections, or if you went to the right private school (aka &quot;the old school tie&quot; network). In the public sector, your career will progress more rapidly if you are member of the somewhat sinister, crypto-masonic organisation called Common Purpose. Huge numbers of police officers are masons or members of Common Purpose, for instance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Jews have their own conspiracy just like every mafia. I don&#39;t really blame them for this because every religious group seeks to expand their power and influence. The Hare Krishnas would take over the world if we were to let them.</p>

<p>The problem is that they took over the US. Now we&#39;ve got a situation like my dog driving a semi.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not really anything particular to them that put in this situation they&#39;re destroying the world, I&#39;m pretty sure if you put any single-interest group in charge of the world&#39;s superpower they&#39;d eventually blow the place up. It needs a diversity of interests in power to prevent anything extreme happening.</p>

<p>But, we don&#39;t. They&#39;ve captured it now and they intend to use it to accomplish their lame-ass goals. Like a delusional bully whom everyone smiles at but then secretly grimaces at when they&#39;re not looking, Israel&#39;s existence is so precarious literally because of the extremely bad characters of its inhabitants.</p>

<p>If this were a master race, they would have worked out how to bring peace, prosperity and friendship to their otherwise peaceful neighbours in the region. But, they don&#39;t. Why? lol I don&#39;t even know.</p>

<p>So, in answer to your question, I do think there is a Jewish conspiracy, but I stopped caring about it because like the image of my dog in the truck earlier, in that situation you just kind of laugh and watch what happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most world views I find are overly simplistic. Contrary to popular belief, &quot;Jews&quot; are not the overlord of the world. For example, Free Masonry and all of its  related factions is much more influent and insidious than the &quot;Jews&quot; everyone talks about. Not to mention there are many other factions and organizations of various sizes  throughout world societies having different influences, whether it be organised crime or even corporations.</p>

<p>Right, it&#39;s the WASPs - i.e., &quot;Freemasons,&quot; not the Jews.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why virtually every politician, from the liberal Democrats to the conservative Republicans, votes for everything Israel wants, from aid, to defense, to votes in the UN.</p>

<p>Because WASPs, not the Jewish lobby.</p>

<p>In fact, there is no such things as the Jewish lobby, AIPAC is a conspiracy theory, and Haim Saban and Sheldon Adelson are a figment of your imagination.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the Freemasons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1773 – Mayer Amschel Rothschild assembles twelve of his most influential friends, and convinces them that if they all pool their resources together, they can rule the world. This meeting takes place in Frankfurt, Germany. Rothschild also informs his friends that he has found the perfect candidate, an individual of incredible intellect and ingenuity, to lead the organization he has planned – Adam Weishaupt.  - See more at: <a href="http://humansarefree.com/2013/10/the-complete-history-of-freemasonry-and.html#sthash.6xcJTT5e.dpuf">http://humansarefree.com/2013/10/the-complete-history-of-freemasonry-and.html#sthash.6xcJTT5e.dpuf</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was honestly hilarious how cringe worthy it was....  You lied about being Jewish on the internet so I would bet that is mostly fiction as well.  </p>

<p>I could be wrong though, maybe anti-semetic conspiracy nuts pull crazy pussy.  Looking through your history it sure seems like you&#39;re a pretty cool ladies man.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Man, back in the day, Craigslist was like hook up central. I guess it’s Tinder now. Girls who posted online were basically DTF, so you know, being a guy living in New York and making a pretty good salary, well, I raped and pillaged like a fucking Viking. Don’t deny it, you would too.</p>

<p><strong>TOTALLY NOT A GUY LYING ON THE INTERNTET.  LIKE, FOR REAL, THIS WAS MY LIFE, TRUST ME. I AM AWESOME</strong>  btw has anyone noticed these Jews are just getting <em>out of hand</em> lately?</p>

<p>Edit #2:</p>

<p>So, heh, I actually fucked three women over the course of 24 hours once</p>

<p>Dude I take back everything, you are so fucking cool I want to be just like you.</p>

<p>Edit 3:  I take back my take back.  You are a shitty writer.  It&#39;s like you don&#39;t know any adjectives other than &quot;amazing&quot; and &quot;awesome.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The funny part is - you are absolutely obsessed with me. You&#39;re the one reading my stories. I&#39;m barely even talking to you.</p>

<p>I think that you are Jewish, and you are fantasizing that I&#39;m some big blonde Nazi and you&#39;re diddling to the idea that I&#39;d whip you and make you lick my leather boots, huh?</p>

<p>Dude - no judgement no shame, but I&#39;m not into stalag, got it?</p>

<p>Oh and your blog, that is still pretty funny as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just spectacular avoidance of the question once again.  Remarkable.</p>

<p>All you ever had to do was explain why you lied about being Jewish and I would have stopped bothering you.  It doesn&#39;t offend me, I am just insanely curious as to why an obvious anti-semite would even try to lie like that.  Just boggles the mind is all and was hoping you could maybe help me understand with some kind of an explanation, but you avoid the question with such masterful skill what can I do...</p>

<p>Edit:  I gave it a read and I gotta say, no wonder you can&#39;t write for shit yourself.  No subtly, just throws everything right in your face.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, obviously you don&#39;t <em>have</em> to do anything, my point is that is why I was bothering you.  I hope you&#39;re just trying to be a dick and continue to avoid that fact that you&#39;re a racist anti-semite who pretends to be Jewish to justify said anti-semitism on the internet, and you&#39;re not really so retarded as to think I was implying I am some all-powerful being you must obey or else. </p>

<p>You must be particular sad person to lie so much about your life on the internet.</p>
