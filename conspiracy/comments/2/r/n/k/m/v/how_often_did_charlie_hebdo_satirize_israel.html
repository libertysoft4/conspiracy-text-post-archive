I got into a debate today at work with a colleague who hinted that she thought that Charlie Hebdo, because they did not satire Israel was more of a part of the propaganda machine than an actual objective satirical publication.  Hence my Google search and this question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Am I alone in finding them as insulting as possible without being funny or astute. Satire is usually directed at those in authority in ways that subtly undermines that authority and provokes genuine thought.</p>

<p>This seems to only fulfill the insulting part of satire nothing else. It seems like going out of your way to insult a mob family because they are evil which is fair enough in simple terms - but it seems dangerous without being particularly valuable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At a personal level, you can make whatever jokes you want, but when it goes public, everything changes. This is not about freedom of speech, is about how offensive the speech can be. It&#39;s sad it went so/too far, but allowing those cartoons to be published in the first place, shows there is a problem at the core of the french society. Shouting the &quot;N&quot; word in african american people faces will be simply stupid, not a proof for freedom I can express. The jewish aspect of this biased attitude, which media avoids because of the &quot;holocaust&quot; scarecrow, it&#39;s worth more attention. If you reverse the places and put french immigrants in Iran, let&#39;s say, they wont like any jokes made by any institution backed by the local laws, and they will ask authorities to step in (to say the least). Freedom of speech is a fundamental value that only civilized societies can understand, support and respect. You can admit that all the muslim part of the world needs and is experiencing a big change at the moment, but pushing its people buttons wont help at all. By contrary, it will create involved or collateral victims. The french society in general and french media in particular needs a different approach of this matter, reconsider what &quot;humor&quot; really is, otherwise a war will have only loosers. Many of them. Muslim extremists see only one resolution, as long as french society wont try to find common ground with all the muslims world, and that includes all kind of media too. Making fun of muslim values is stupid and childish specially because nobody likes the consequences we&#39;ve seen today.<br/>
And media is a business before is anything else, so that magazine was created to appeal to a certain type of consumer, that will pay the money to get amused by other people drawings, about some culture they were to busy to understand and listen to.</p>

<p>Kind&#39;a reminds me of the FBI &quot;finding&quot; all the hijackers passports on the streets of New York (in near pristine condition) on 9/11.  Way too &quot;convenient&quot; for reality.</p>

<p>...further, I am sure it has <strong><em>NOTHING</em></strong> to do with the fact that France recently it&#39;s support of Palestine as a State:</p>

<p>nahh... nothing to do with that ;)  ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They planned it so meticulously that they went to the wrong house first. Duh.
Also planning and execution are two very different things. I don&#39;t find it very hard to imagine that they had other things on their mind than to check the contents of every pocket and every niche of the car when they left.</p>

<p>Or let me put it differently: you want me to believe that the CIA/FBI/Mossad meticulously planned staging a mass murder commited by 2 muslims in order to serve ther political agenda, precisely prediction the reactions of billions of people around the world... and yet they couldn&#39;t come up with a better idea of how to reveal their identity than placing a fake ID in the getaway car? </p>
