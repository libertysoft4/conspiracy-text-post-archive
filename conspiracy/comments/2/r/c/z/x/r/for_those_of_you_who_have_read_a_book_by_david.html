<p>But for the past few years, I&#39;ve been noticing the current events, and more and more often I&#39;m saying to myself &#39;you know, he really was right all along!&#39;. Just recently, i&#39;ve come to the conclusion that David Icke was probably right about the universe being holographic in nature.</p>

<p>It seems he&#39;s right about everything except the reptilians (yet!). Either Alex Jones was right when he said that the reptilians were the turd in his punchbowl, or we need to closer inspect the bloodline of the royal family.</p>

<p>its pretty clear most of the people they accuse of being them are disgusting human beings and its easier for people to believe they aren&#39;t human and hence can act that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I enjoyed his book. In many cases, he provides logical speculations (though, i consider them only <strong><em>speculations</em></strong>), that explain a lot of things that conventional thought fails to consider. He was also where i originally found out about the 223 genes found in the human genome that shouldnt be there, as they arent found anywhere else in the animal kingdom (that we know of) and all of them arose at the same time, and in evolutionary timeframes, overnight. This means that we did not directly evolve from chimps. I have also found other studies conscerning this as well, which have speculated lateral gene transmission from microbes like viruses and bacteria, which doesnt happen at such a magnetude naturally. This hints at some sort of intelligent genetic manipulation within our evolution. Lloyd pye has written stuff about this in mote depth.</p>

<p>In other sections of his book, Icke talks about frequencies and vibrations, amd how different lifeforms take upon different vibrations and thereby live amonvst us, kind of in different dimensions. He uses recent quantum theory in some of his explanations, and i dig that.</p>

<p>But what makes him controversial is the fact that his claims are often not quantifiable, nor backed by any studies as our technological aptitude has not met the level of competency nor do we have the understanding of the interworkings of our universe in order to design and then conduct tests to figure if he is wrong or right. Couple this with his seemingly farfetched claims, e.g. &quot;shapeshifters&quot;, and you get the very definition controversy. </p>

<p>Its good entertainment. And its good food for thought. Do i beljeve him? Sometimes. He does provide some sources and uses some verifiable facts (such as for some of his claims about 9/11) that can be verified, then he speculates further. It could be he is right on the money. It could also be hes bat shit crazy. We just do not know because science, or rather our current understanding of science, does not allow us to know either way (yet). </p>

<p>You dont read much about this subject, do you? There are lots of folks who make this claim.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>From the studies ive read, they arent even sure if it happens on any magnitude, though there has been evidence to suggest that some microbes have, indeed, passed their genes along to humans. The studies noted that there are possibly about forty genes where this has occured in humans, over our species lifetime of existence. Theybalso note that this is a thing in other members of the animal kingdom as well, humans arent exclusive to this. But, as for 223 arising roughly at the same time and overnight? There is just no precedence in any of the genetic records we have to date. Its a scientific enigma.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I didnt know that you were familiar with icke on a personal level. </p>

<p>You seem like one of those people who demand to see a degree next to ones name before you admit they know something about anything. Degrees dont mean shit. Albert einstein, one of the greatest minds to ever have existed, did much of his biggest stuff on his own research on his own time. Without a formal degree. </p>

<p>Just because Icke isnt a genecist, or a theoretical physicist, doesnt mean that he knows &quot;precisely zero&quot;. </p>

<p>And this leads me to ask you, <em>what do you know?</em> And why are you even commenting on a thread that you are obviously ignorant about, and why do so in such an arrogant fashion? Is there something constructive youd like to provide, or are you purposely trying to be derisive?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>However controversial he may be, and for whatever reasons, you gotta give the man credit where it&#39;s due. </p>

<p>David Icke has been talking about elite pedophilia and satanic cults LONG before anyone was onto it; At least 20yrs ago. He was calling Jimmy Saville a pedo back in the early 90&#39;s as well as many others, and interestingly, not one of the many high profile people he has accused of pedophilia have ever tried to sue him. </p>

<p>If you are not into the reptilian stuff then skip it. It&#39;s not enough reason to disregard his enormous amount of research and information. He covers 9/11, politics, education, medicine, wars, corporations, financial institutions, spirituality &amp; the holographic nature of the universe. </p>

<p>People seem to like to either &#39;love&#39; or &#39;hate&#39;. I think you can dip in and out of his work and just appreciate the information you&#39;re getting and decide if it&#39;s true without worrying too much about which side you fall on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a general comment... But something I wish I understood earlier was that we don&#39;t need to agree with everything ANYONE has to say. We can pick and choose. For example the whole reptilian thing a little too much to swallow? Set it aside and embrace the many things Icke says that are more accessible. </p>

<p>Or take Alex Jones, I believe he is part of the Illuminati&#39;s &#39;revelation of the method&#39;. All he does is spread fear and offer no solutions. The answer to 1984 is 1776? WTH? Thanks a lot Alex. But at the same time most of what he says is right on the money. The people you have to watch are those who give you 95-99% truth. It is like Jesus said, beware the leaven, just a little spoils the whole lump.</p>
