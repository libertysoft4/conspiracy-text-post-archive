        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Before I get into this, I will first claim that the average American is receiving a dose of fluoride between ~5mg - ~10 mg, depending on your specific situation. If you disagree with this, please <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2r25tt/10_fluoride_facts_you_should_know/cnbqert?context=3">see my post here</a>. That dosage will be an important figure further into this: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=its-time-to-end-the-war-on-salt"><strong>Salt is not bad for you</strong></a></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodised_salt">In the U.S. in the early 20th century, goitre was especially prevalent in the region around the Great Lakes and the Pacific Northwest. David Murray Cowie, a professor of paediatrics at the University of Michigan, led the U.S. to adopt the Swiss practice of adding sodium iodide or potassium iodide to table and cooking salt. On May 1, 1924, iodised salt was sold commercially in Michigan. By the fall of <strong>1924</strong>, Morton Salt Company began distributing <strong>iodised salt</strong> nationally. There was a gradual increase in average intelligence of 1 standard deviation, 15 points, in iodine-deficient areas, 3.5 points nationally, but also an increase in deaths of older people in iodine-deficient areas due to <strong>hyperthyroidism</strong>.</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/REDs/factsheets/0087fact.pdf">Cryolite (fluoride) was first registered as a pesticide in the U.S. in <strong>1957</strong></a> (Still widespread use)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/REDs/factsheets/0176fact.pdf">Sulfuryl fluoride (food warehouse fumigant) was first registered in <strong>December 1959</strong></a> (Still in use. EPA just proposed a phase-out because of the anti-fluoride advocacy group Fluoride Action Network)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/sulfuryl-fluoride/evaluations.html">(Sulfuryl Fluoride leaves residue) Proof</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_fluoridation">by <strong>1960</strong> water fluoridation had become widely used in the U.S</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>By this point, everyone&#39;s thyroid is getting hammered with fluoride, but obesity is not a problem because of iodine supplementation in salt</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=its-time-to-end-the-war-on-salt">...Nevertheless, in <strong>1977</strong> the U.S. Senate’s Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs released a report recommending that Americans cut their salt intake by 50 to 85 percent</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://freakonomics.com/2013/07/23/the-history-of-obesity-revisited/">We found that child obesity rates were low and stable among children born in the 1930s, 40s, 50s, 60s, and <strong>part of the 70s, and then rose rapidly through the 1980s and 1990s.</strong></a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.slweb.org/galletti.html">ABSTRACT: Prolonged administration of a <strong>daily dose of 5-10 mg. of fluoride</strong> to patients with hyperthyroidism may cause clinical improvement <strong>together with a significant fall in the level of plasma protein-bound iodine</strong> and a reduction in the basal metabolic rate.</a> (This dose easily achieved in the US today, see <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1r920i/government_recommends_lowering_fluoride_levels_in/">my post here</a> )</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19201548">East African immigrants to Scandinavia are admitted to mental hospitals far more frequently than native Scandinavians. Most of these patients are admitted for psychosis, commonly ascribed to problems adapting to the new culture. However, psychosis is also known to be associated with hyperthyroidism, and the high frequency of psychosis among East Africans in Scandinavia may at least in part be due to hyperthyroidism rather than cultural problems. Large areas in East Africa are notorious for high natural concentrations of fluoride in water and plants. <strong>Fluoride inhibits the production of thyroid hormones. To maintain normal thyroxin levels the body increases the capacity for thyroxin production. Goitre is caused by such a compensatory mechanism, and endemic goitre is widespread in many high-fluoride areas, even where dietary access to iodine is adequate. When people from such areas arrive in a low-fluoride area, their elevated capacity to produce thyroid hormones may lead to hyperthyroidism</strong> and subsequently to psychosis.</a></p></li>

</ul>

<p>((It appears that both Hypo and Hyper-thyroidism are caused by fluoride intake, which causes hypertension/high blood pressure (other causes contribute), and the presence or absence of iodine (iodized salt intake) determines which side you fall on. Obesity appears to be caused by fluoride intake and iodine deficiency(the epidemic, not necessarily obesity for any one person). Obesity is not a cause of low intelligence, but low iodine combined with high fluoride intake causes both Obesity and mental deterioration. <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01985204">Clinical trial on iodine and obesity in progress</a>))</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget the Pineal gland where it accumulates also gets disrupted in its ability to control your sleep wake cycle and hormone balance. </p>

<p>&quot;The Hypothalmic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis – The pineal gland, through its production of melatonin and its effect on serotonin, affects many neuroendocrine functions. Reduced melatonin, through various pathways, disrupts cortisol rhythms, and significantly impairs the sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. As well, one study has shown a reciprocal relationship between the pineal and pituitary gland, so that if the pineal is impaired, it affects the pituitary. This has a whole cascade of effects on the other glands and hormone production&quot; Anything that disrupts the pineal is going to affect the HPTA axis and your hormones. Wonder why people are suffering low testosterone and are unwilling to resist domination? There you go. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you on &quot;superfoods&quot; every week or so I seem to learn about another one, and even if there is some truth to them, as you allude nothing is a cure-all. Here&#39;s a bit of anecdotal evidence from my own experience. I&#39;m sure you have heard the musings of some who claim fluoride calcifies the pineal gland, which is difficult to prove short of an autopsy. I purchased chlorella and spurlina powder last year after reading about their &quot;superfood&quot; status but only mixed both a handful of times because they taste so terribly even when diluted in a smoothie. About five or six months ago I read an article claiming a Chinese study shows chlorella was used as a treatment for skeletal flurosis which reignited my interest in it. I for a few days in a row mixed this awful tasting stuff with distilled water, cacao powder, and chocolate whey powder in an effort to help with the taste and by day three I started having the most vivid and lifelike dreams. I honestly cannot tell you the last time I had such dreams prior to that, and since then I notice after a chlorella mix (veggie smoothie, or the mix I described) I seem to have dreams of some kind, whereas normally they are far more infrequent. There is something to it but I&#39;m not 100% sure what it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HFCS is also being used as a sinister agent to delivery Mercury in small quantities over time.</p>

<p>Per WaPo:</p>

<p>MONDAY, Jan. 26 (HealthDay News) -- Almost half of tested samples of commercial high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) contained mercury, which was also found in nearly a third of 55 popular brand-name food and beverage products where HFCS is the first- or second-highest labeled ingredient, according to two new U.S. studies.</p>

<p>HFCS has replaced sugar as the sweetener in many beverages and foods such as breads, cereals, breakfast bars, lunch meats, yogurts, soups and condiments. On average, Americans consume about 12 teaspoons per day of HFCS, but teens and other high consumers can take in 80 percent more HFCS than average.</p>

<p>&quot;Mercury is toxic in all its forms. Given how much high-fructose corn syrup is consumed by children, it could be a significant additional source of mercury never before considered. We are calling for immediate changes by industry and the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] to help stop this avoidable mercury contamination of the food supply,&quot; the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy&#39;s Dr. David Wallinga, a co-author of both studies, said in a prepared statement.</p>

<p>In the first study, published in current issue of Environmental Health, researchers found detectable levels of mercury in nine of 20 samples of commercial HFCS.</p>

<p>And in the second study, the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP), a non-profit watchdog group, found that nearly one in three of 55 brand-name foods contained mercury. The chemical was found most commonly in HFCS-containing dairy products, dressings and condiments.</p>

<p>But an organization representing the refiners is disputing the results published in Environmental Health.</p>

<p>&quot;This study appears to be based on outdated information of dubious significance,&quot; said Audrae Erickson, president of the Corn Refiners Association, in a statement. &quot;Our industry has used mercury-free versions of the two re-agents mentioned in the study, hydrochloric acid and caustic soda, for several years. These mercury-free re-agents perform important functions, including adjusting pH balances.&quot;</p>

<p>However, the IATP told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that four plants in Georgia, Tennessee, Ohio and West Virginia still use &quot;mercury-cell&quot; technology that can lead to contamination.</p>

<p>IATP&#39;s Ben Lilliston also told HealthDay that the Environmental Health findings were based on information gathered by the FDA in 2005.</p>

<p>And the group&#39;s own study, while not peer-reviewed, was based on products &quot;bought off the shelf in the autumn of 2008,&quot; Lilliston added.</p>

<p>The use of mercury-contaminated caustic soda in the production of HFCS is common. The contamination occurs when mercury cells are used to produce caustic soda.</p>

<p>&quot;The bad news is that nobody knows whether or not their soda or snack food contains HFCS made from ingredients like caustic soda contaminated with mercury. The good news is that mercury-free HFCS ingredients exist. Food companies just need a good push to only use those ingredients,&quot; Wallinga said in his prepared statement.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/26/AR2009012601831.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/26/AR2009012601831.html</a></p>

<p>Number five on the list behind As, Cs, Po, and Pu.</p>

<p>&quot;The poisonous qualities of mercury have long been known about thanks to the self-sacrifice made by early dentists and hatters – apparently the phrase “mad as a hatter” comes from the fact that mercury was used in hat making resulting in high levels of dementia.</p>

<p>One of the things that makes mercury dangerous is it can be absorbed through the skin. In addition mercury also evaporates quickly making inhalation a real danger.
Another worrying feature of mercury is its ability to build up in the food chain, particularly seafood. This is because evaporated mercury eventually ends up in the sea or lakes.</p>

<p>The most noticeable effects of mercury poisoning are neurological. All the senses may be effected, along with coordination and muscle strength. Memory is also likely to be affected.</p>

<p>Sufficient doses of mercury are likely to be fatal as Emperor Qin Shi Huang of China found out when he took several pills intended to give him eternal life!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Started iodine supplements since I have hashimotos. Been eating eat only organic in hopes of controlling my thyroid symptoms. Going great so far. Doctor says they think if you get your iodine levels up that you won&#39;t need thyroid medicine. Did a iodine study took an iodine tablet and then collected urine for 24 hours. Results said I should take it. But I know with hashimotos it sometimes hyper and others hypo.I stayed hypo before taking thyroid meds. And I only feel better when my tsh is near zero. But now with iodine I can tell my thyroid is off from the symptoms I experience. So going back for blood work to see if I can stop my cocktail of thyroid meds. Cytomel, tirosent and armour... Its the only combo I found where I felt half way decent. But again with hashimotos what works one year may not work the next.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. I did a lot of research on iodine supplements when my mother was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and found that <a href="http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/nascent-iodine-detoxadine.html/?a_aid=52ddd0496ed29">this one</a> seems to be the best on the market. It&#39;s <em>not</em> made from seaweed/kelp (which may now be contaminated with Fukushima radiation) and isn&#39;t in an alcohol base (vegetable glycerin, instead).</p>

<p>I started taking it with her about a year ago with dramatic results. Within about a month she was almost 100% better. For me, the &quot;detox period&quot; lasted about 5 days and was really uncomfortable. I had terrible mind fog and couldn&#39;t sleep as my body was kicking out the fluoride, bromine and chlorine. After a week or so, I felt amazing. I could almost feel my IQ increasing, and I felt physically younger. In hindsight, I realize that&#39;s how most people <em>should</em> feel. It&#39;s only because of these toxins that I had become used to feeling like crap all the time.</p>

<p>No exaggeration, nascent iodine has changed my life for the better. People really should try it if they haven&#39;t already. Especially those of us in fluoridated communities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think cutting out fluoride from water is enough. You&#39;ll probably absorb at least a half milligram per day from using toothpaste, even more from certain foods. But, it is a lot cheaper than most people think. A decent water distiller is about 200 bucks, but costs only cents to produce a gallon (it really depends on how much you pay for electricity in your area, but it&#39;s cheap.) That is much cheaper than buying gallon jugs of distilled water, or any kind of water. If you&#39;re paranoid about distilled water being bad for you, you could use cochydro like I do. I also use it to make a lot of teas, but DO NOT drink black/green tea. Those contain so much fluoride. </p>

<p>To answer your question, I wouldn&#39;t know. My mother gave us spring water as kids, and I&#39;ve always used distilled water. Fluoride also isn&#39;t the only thing you need to worry about in tap water, but I&#39;ll save that for another post I suppose. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Halogen facts from another thread I wrote:</p>

<p>Iodine is a touchy subject among some medical professionals if one does enough research. The only thing seem to be agreed upon is it is an important trace element and prevents goiter, the dosing amounts or how it should be distributed to the populace are usually subject to debate.</p>

<p>Regarding getting the RDA prescribed by NIH via salt in the diet, per Harvard:</p>

<p>&quot;Most Americans take in more sodium than they need. Almost all of it comes from salt. But here&#39;s the rub: between 75% and 90% of sodium in the average American&#39;s diet comes from prepared or processed food, and most food companies don&#39;t use iodized salt. The so-called hidden salt in processed food is a great place to start trimming sodium from your diet, and cutting back on it will have little effect on your iodine intake.</p>

<p>To get all your iodine from salt, you would need more than half a teaspoon of iodized salt a day. That&#39;s two-thirds of the daily allotment of sodium (1,500 milligrams) recommended by the American Heart Association.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletters/Harvard_Heart_Letter/2011/June/cut-salt-it-wont-affect-your-iodine-intake">http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletters/Harvard_Heart_Letter/2011/June/cut-salt-it-wont-affect-your-iodine-intake</a></p>

<p>WebMD adds:
&quot;Iodized salt is now the main source of iodine in the American diet, but only about 20% of the salt Americans eat contains the micronutrient, Dasgupta says.&quot;
&quot;Dasgupta and colleagues recently tested 88 samples of iodized salt and found that 47 of them, or 53%, did not meet the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#39;s recommendations for iodine levels.
Iodine levels tended to decrease in individual containers with exposure to humidity, but light and heat had little effect.
The findings are published in the latest online issue of the American Chemical Society journal Environmental Science and Technology.&quot;
&quot;Iodine is important in the production of thyroid hormones and critical to normal brain development in newborn infants and children. Iodine deficiency is the leading preventable cause of cretinism in the developing world. And at least one study suggests that children in developed countries born to iodine-deficient moms may have an increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/news/20080201/can-us-shake-iodine-deficiency-risk">http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/news/20080201/can-us-shake-iodine-deficiency-risk</a></p>

<p>Thus, many Americans may be iodine deficient if they expect to get their RDA in their diets through iodized salt alone.</p>

<p>I&#39;m prepared to be wrong but all of the halogens have antibacterial properties from what I can remember.</p>

<p>Per NIH:
&quot;Although very high levels of fluoride (0.16-0.3 mol/L) will kill bacteria, there is little evidence that fluoride causes dramatic changes in the number of species found in plaque or their relative concentrations.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2179326">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2179326</a></p>

<p>So it can kill bacteria in the proper concentrations but there remains little evidence it affects changes in the number of species or concentrations of plaque. Ha.</p>

<p>I&#39;m more concerned about the long con of dumping a neurotoxin into the water supply at 0.8-1.2mg/g with no recourse by the citizenry while NOT also including cheap benign vitamins such as C even at a similar low dosage.</p>

<p>&quot;“Fluoride seems to fit in with lead, mercury, and other poisons that cause chemical brain drain,” Grandjean says. “The effect of each toxicant may seem small, but the combined damage on a population scale can be serious, especially because the brain power of the next generation is crucial to all of us.”&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/fluoride-childrens-health-grandjean-choi/">http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/fluoride-childrens-health-grandjean-choi/</a>
I also love this:</p>

<p>&quot;People with levels between normal levels and those required for skeletal fluorosis tend to have symptoms similar to arthritis.[1]&quot;
So somewhere between something which previously only existed in certain parts of nature -so normal being none excluding outliers- and severe being skeletal fluorosis, one might suffer from symptoms of arthritis. They are all but saying <em>fluoride tends to cause arthritis symptoms</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halogen">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halogen</a></p>

<p>EDIT: I was in another thread which led me to a paper: &quot;Curcumin attenuates neurotoxicity induced by fluoride: An in vivo evidence&quot;. Evidently mice were dosed with F (120 ppm) daily for 30 days and then treated with Curcumin. The reason I include this here is because this is further proof fluoride is a known neurotoxin to science but sure we&#39;ll dose you nearly a mg/gal every day for your whole life you&#39;ll be fine, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh yeah, and the iodized salt that they sell has no iodine in it. even if it did, its not a high enough dose anyway.
iodine sublimates rapidly out of the salt when exposed to the atmosphere.</p>
