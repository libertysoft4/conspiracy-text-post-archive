<p>Everytime you simply put two heights here, the tangent drops downs to..sea level.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, the formula you posted calculates the maximum line of sight over the sea, and that&#39;s exactly what it is designed to calculate (notice that the provided image is measuring visibility from a ship at sea to a landmark on the shore). If you want to calculate the visibility range between two landmarks with elevated ground between them, the formula does need to be modified, but not in the way you&#39;ve described.</p>

<p>Rather than adjusting the height of your landmarks, what you actually want to adjust is the radius of the Earth. In <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/HorizonDistance.png">the formula you provided</a>, you can see that the R term represents the radius of the Earth at sea level. There&#39;s an error in units there, as the radius is claimed to be in Mm, but in order for the formula to be correct the radius must be provided in kilometers (the radius of the Earth is ~6378 km at sea level). With the units corrected, the formula should read as follows (with the result and all variables given in km):</p>

<p>Visibility Distance = Dl + Db = (sqrt(2 * R) * sqrt(hl)) + (sqrt(2 * R) * sqrt(hb)) = sqrt(2 * 6378) * (sqrt(hl) + sqrt(hb))</p>

<p>With the formula corrected, you&#39;ll see that the results match the <a href="http://members.home.nl/7seas/radcalc.htm">visibility range calculator</a> you provided ([edit] The calculator actually uses a radius of 6378.155 km).</p>

<p>Now, to account for elevated ground between the two landmarks, you need to add the ground elevation to the radius of the Earth at sea level. You also need to make sure that the two heights of your landmarks are measured from the elevated ground level.</p>

<p>For example, let&#39;s say your two landmarks are two towers of height 400m and 600m (above ground level), and your ground level is 200 meters above sea level.</p>

<p>In this case, your calculation becomes:</p>

<p>hl = 0.4 km</p>

<p>hb = 0.6 km</p>

<p>R = (6378 + 0.2) km</p>

<p>Visibility Distance = sqrt(2 * R) * (sqrt(hl) + sqrt(hb)) = sqrt(2 * 6378.2) * (sqrt(0.4) + sqrt(0.6))</p>

<p>Visibility Distance = sqrt(2 * 6378.2) * (sqrt(0.4) + sqrt(0.6)) = <strong>158.9184 km</strong></p>

<p>By modifying the formula in this way, you&#39;re calculating the visibility range with the tangent dropping to ground level instead of sea level. Keep in mind that accounting for ground elevation doesn&#39;t actually make much of a difference, as the elevation of the ground above sea level is tiny compared to the radius of the Earth. For example, the most elevated city in the world (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_towers_in_the_world">El Alto</a>) is at an elevation of 4.15 km, which is only 0.065% of the radius of the Earth at sea level. Also keep in mind that this calculation does not account for refraction of light in the atmosphere, and in reality refraction allows for greater visibility ranges than a straight line tangent.</p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Since the elevations are provided above sea level, and the ground is 5000m above sea level, I subtract 5000m from each height to obtain height above ground level.</p>

<p>Ha = Height of viewpoint A relative to ground level = (5000m + 2m) - 5000m =  0.002 km</p>

<p>Hb = Height of target B relative to ground level = 5000m - 5000m = 0 km</p>

<p>Now, I add the ground level (5km) to the radius of the Earth at sea level:</p>

<p>R = Radius of Earth at ground level = (6378 + 5) km = 6383 km</p>

<p>Visibility Distance = sqrt(2 * R) * (sqrt(Ha) + sqrt(Hb))</p>

<p>Visibility Distance = sqrt(2 * 6383) * (sqrt(0.002) + sqrt(0)) = <strong>5.0529 km</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good :) But you should have also subtracted in your previous example :)</p>

<p>hl = 0.4 km
hb = 0.6 km</p>

<p>600 m - 400 m = 200 m so the elevation above the ground is 200 m :)</p>

<p>Now, we have 200 m and 0 m.</p>

<p>So the visibility distance is <strong>50 km</strong> </p>

<p>No. If the height of your objects are given relative to sea level, you subtract the ground elevation from both values to get their height relative to ground level. In my example the heights were already given relative to ground level. There is no need to subtract one height from the other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And you did the very same thing I did.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your calculation works out to be almost the same as mine in the special case where one of your objects is exactly at ground level. Even in that case, you are not actually accounting for the increased radius of the Earth at ground level correctly, although the difference in results is insignificant. In all other cases where both objects are elevated above the ground, your method does not correctly apply the provided formula. This is why I gave you a different example than the one you provided.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s modify your example to demostrate:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have two points (A and B) located on a flat terrain (5000 m above sea level) Elevation of point A is 5000 m above sea level. Elevation of point B is also 5000 m above seal level. We stand in point A, our height is 2 m. What is the distance between point A and B ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We both agree that the answer to this problem is <strong>5.05 km</strong>. Now, what happens if we put a post 1m high at point B, and calculate the distance at which it can be seen by the 2m tall observer at point A?</p>

<p>Using my method (exactly the same calculation as before, except Hb is now 0.001 km):</p>

<p>Visibility Distance = sqrt(2 * 6383) * (sqrt(0.002) + sqrt(0.001)) = <strong>8.626 km</strong></p>

<p>The result is larger, as should be expected since the object being viewed is taller. Now, applying your method of subtracting the two values, and using the sea level radius of the Earth:</p>

<p>R = 6378 km</p>

<p>Ha = 2m - 1m = 0.001 km</p>

<p>Hb = 0 km</p>

<p>Visibility Distance = sqrt(2 * 6378) * (sqrt(0.001) + sqrt(0.000)) = <strong>3.571 km</strong></p>

<p>According to your method, the visibility distance went down. Does it make sense that a point on the ground can be viewed from farther away than a 1m tall post? No.</p>

<p>No. In your new example you&#39;ve fixed the position of point B at a distance of 5.05 km. The maximum range at which it would be visible over open sea therefore has no impact on its distance from point A (which is obviously 5.05 km).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That it doesn&#39;t matter if there is ground or sea between. If there is ground it doesn&#39;t matter what its elevation is. Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, if you set two points at fixed positions, the distance between them doesn&#39;t depend on the material in the space between them. That has nothing to do with what you originally wanted to discuss, which was maximum visibility range of landmarks over the horizon. You seem to be confused about what exactly you&#39;re trying to calculate.</p>
