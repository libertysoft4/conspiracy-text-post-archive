<p><strong><a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/ctrl@listserv.aol.com/msg84247.html">USS Cole in Aden - Another USS Liberty?</a> .. Copyright Joe Vialls, October 15, 2000.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>October 12, 2000, the State of Israel attacked USS Cole upon entry to Aden Harbor in South Yemen, the second time Israel has attacked an American ship in international waters, after the 1967 attack on USS Liberty.</p>

<p>The attack was a &quot;false flag&quot; operation, designed to drag America into the Middle East conflict on the side of Israel .. militant Arabs allegedly standing to attention in a small rubber boat seconds before impact, never happened. </p>

<p>There was no rubber boat and there were no militant Arabs, one moment the USS Cole was making a slow approach to her mooring, the next the engine room exploded, killing six crew members and vaporizing another ten or eleven. </p>

<p>Damage was massive, with a 20 x 40 foot hole in the hull, main engines destroyed, bulkheads torn apart, and severe damage inflicted on the keel .. microscopic fragments recovered from the site, indicate USS Cole was hit by a television guided <a href="http://i.minus.com/ilOZ5DchCLkGA.jpg">Rafael Popeye 2</a> anti ship missile.</p>

<p>Designated AGM 142B by the US military, it has never been purchased by American forces. The only nations currently known to possess and use this missile are Israel, Turkey and North Korea. </p>

<p><a href="http://911review.org/Wget/winterpatriot/jerome-hauer.html">911 Review.org: Meet Jerome Hauer, 9/11 Suspect Awaiting Indictment</a></p>

<p><strong>John O’Neill February 6, 1952 – September 11, 2001 - O&#39;Neill was a three decade FBI veteran who started as a clerk in 1972.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>He became an agent in 1976, and went to New York as Head of FBI Intelligence about a year after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, he led the FBI investigation of the October 12, 2000, terrorist bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen.</p>

<p>He retired August 2001 at age 49, to become chief of security at the World Trade Center with Silverstein Properties, after the New York Port Authority had granted a 99 year lease of the Twin Towers and four other buildings to Silverstein in April of that year for an estimated $3.2 billion.</p>

<p>During his investigation of the USS Cole attack blamed on Abu Nidal the leader of the infamous Black September terror organization, O&#39;Neill talked openly with other field agents that he suspected Abu Nidal was Mossad. </p>

<p>Barbara Bodine Jewish US Ambassador to Yemen when the USS Cole was attacked, started an intense political battle to oust O’Neill, she wanted to control the investigation, and resented the fact that there were hundreds of FBI personnel in the country.</p>

<p>She complained to Madeleine Albright US Secretary of State, that the FBI was overly aggressive, Albright took the matter up with the upper echelons of the FBI, finally going to the Zionist Jewish FBI Director Louis Freeh, who removed O&#39;Neill from Yemen and in July 2001 O’Neill resigned from the FBI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>September 11, 2001, Jerome Hauer was Managing Director of Kroll Associates.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A well established security firm serving clients in the military and the US government, in the 1980s Kroll was known as the &quot;CIA of Wall Street,&quot; because of the sorts of the people it hired, and the sorts of tasks they were assigned.</p>

<p>Kroll was in charge of overall security for the entire World Trade Center complex, at Hauer&#39;s behest, Kroll had hired John O&#39;Neill, his first day of work would be on September 11, 2001.</p>

<p>O&#39;Neill had resigned his post as Deputy Director of the FBI, during the summer very unhappy with the Bush administration&#39;s head in sand approach to terror, after investigations into the attack on USS Cole had been blocked.</p>

<p>John O&#39;Neill was sure Abu Nidal was an Israeli intelligence asset, who was getting the blame for the job on the Cole, he knew FBI investigations into Nidal&#39;s links to Mossad had been shut down in the summer of 2001.</p>

<p>He also would have known that Osama bin Laden would have been incapable of inflicting the amount of damage the US suffered on 911, if the conspirators were hoping to spread a Big Lie about Osama bin Laden, they would have had to silence John O&#39;Neill, and what better way than to entomb him at the scene of the crime?  </p>

<p><strong>Hauer and Dan Rather @ CBS News, were the ones who started the Osama bin Laden did it mindset!</strong> <a href="http://www.dockersunion.net/vb/showthread.php?24-John-O-Neill-Jerome-Hauer-Anthrax-and-the-Myth-of-Osama-bin-Laden!&amp;p=43#post43">John O&#39;Neill, Jerome Hauer, Anthrax and the Myth of Osama bin Laden!</a></p>

<p>Daphne Jackson should be charged with capital conspiracy ..</p>
