<ul>
<li>Terrorist attacks</li>
<li>Passenger jets getting blown up</li>
<li>Wars breaking out everywhere</li>
<li>ebola scares</li>
<li>global warming</li>
<li>great recessions</li>
<li>School shootings</li>
</ul>

<p>The media hypes the shit out of all these things as a means of making people more and more afraid of the world around them. They want to create a mentality in the population where people say &quot;OMG, how is the government going to protect us from the scary world around us?&quot;</p>

<p>Which is the mentality the government needs in order to do the things it would otherwise never be allowed to do. </p>

<p>I mean, think of how much media coverage the ebola thing has gotten and not a single person in the US has gotten sick on US soil. I&#39;m not saying it wasn&#39;t a story but it was blown WAY out of proportion simply to reinforce this ongoing narrative of scaring the public. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is exactly what they are doing. The easiest way to dominate a people is for said people to turn over their freedom to you. The only time people will do that is if they are scared and poor. </p>

<p>If they are self sufficient (ie. have money) and aren&#39;t scared, why in the world would they turn over their freedom to someone else?</p>

<p>You need them desperate (ie. poor) and scared... this creates a yurning for someone to &quot;save them&quot;... that&#39;s when you can step in and take away all their freedoms and they will actually thank you for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One world government is a forgone conclusion in my opinion. The only question is whether it will be a coallition of the willing or whether one country will rule over all. </p>

<p>Right now the US wants to rule over all. Which isn&#39;t a surprise, since the US has so much debt that they can never pay back. If they can disperse that debt across the world, they can then manage it. </p>

<p>The creation of the brics bank suggests that we might ultimate have a two-world government, with Russia, China ruling over one half and the USA ruling over the other. </p>

<p>But there is zero question in my mind that the game being played right now is one of world dominance and spheres of influence. </p>

<p>We get 100s of hours of news about ebola (which is next to no threat to anyone in the US) and we get hardly any coverage on stuff like the CIA spying on the congress. </p>

<p>You must have a short memory. When Snowden blew his whistle the government were cast in a very bad light. Or what about SOPA? Occupy Wall St? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>By presenting the people with spooky stories, they will seek comfort and defence - Of which the government can provide. </p>

<p>If people keep getting lied to by their leaders, they&#39;re not going to suddenly trust leaders on a global scale. </p>

<p>By presenting the public stories about Snowden, SOPA, Occupy etc. These things erode the public trust in authority figures. It doesn&#39;t make any sense for the government to want to do that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, for people only watching mainstream TV news, they are fed the narrative that results in them saying, on Occupy: &quot;Ugh, dirty, spoiled hippies.&quot; Tea Party:  &quot;Ugh, weird old racist white people.&quot; And with the Palestinians, &quot;Ugh, terrorists.&quot; On SOPA: &quot;What&#39;s SOPA?&quot; On Snowden: &quot;Spying is what intelligence agencies are supposed to doooo. Snowden&#39;s a traitor anyway.&quot; </p>

<p>Thank gods for the Internet, but we still have a lot of people only getting their news from mainstream sources. When I have a conversation with a lot of people in the real world about what&#39;s going on in the world, I get a lot of the old &quot;Ugh, $stereotype-I&#39;ve-been-fed. Where are you getting this stuff, anyway? I haven&#39;t heard that.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s right in front of you. The fact that there is some &quot;wonder drug&quot; for Ebola that doctors apparently felt was worth trying on humans without much trial and all it took was two Americans getting Ebola for it to become public. Think about all the people in West Africa dying, but just because these two people (<em>who are incredibly brave and honorable for going to Africa to try and fight the outbreak, don&#39;t get me wrong</em>) happen to have been born in the USA, they get access to it. If it&#39;s safe enough to risk putting it into two American citizens without a trial or control subjects, it&#39;s safe enough to be in West Africa.</p>
