    <div class="md"><p>Only thing that had my head spinning was blatant disinformation spread throughout the documentary. I have actually reviewed documents regarding 9/11 instead of just watching a documentary, and, honestly, this was not that good. For instance, the documentary implies that the Pentagon footage of the plane crashing into the building was edited. The narrator then claims that an object in a frame is the tail of the plane, and that despite the frames from the two different cameras being from the same exact time, the plane is in a different spot. This is completely inaccurate. What the narrator calls the tail of the plane is actually a building in the background and is in every other frame, and the part of the plane the narrator calls the exhaust is actually the nose of the plane.</p>

<p>I could go into more details about inaccuracies and blatant omission of information, but this was so blatant because the person who made the film is showing you the footage of the two cameras and somehow you were tricked into believing what he said instead of looking for yourself. Absolutely incredible. </p>

<p>e: I was expecting the downvotes, but go ahead and verify the contents of the post yourself. Rewatch the Pentagon part of the documentary, for instance, and actually look at the footage instead of accepting what the narrator says as truth. The idea that the videos are out of sync which implies a hoax is completely inaccurate because the narrator is misleading the audience and telling the viewer that a building that is in the background in every frame is the tail of the plane, which, of course, is not true. And what the narrator calls the &quot;exhaust&quot; is nothing more than the nose of the plane, as seen in the other camera which again puts the cameras back in sync. You fell for disinfo, don&#39;t downvote me because you were duped. </p>

<p>Final edit: For the record, I&#39;m a &quot;truther&quot; myself but believe that the Pentagon was hit by a plane. Mainly because the only way the story from a truther perspective makes sense is if a plane hit the Pentagon. I&#39;m not trying to &quot;shill&quot; this thread, but there are better documentaries on 9/11 (and I have seen countless, I&#39;ve been interested in 9/11 since it happened when I was younger). Look at the victims on the site of the Pentagon and you&#39;ll notice it&#39;s overwhelmingly from the Naval offices and the budget department. Passengers on the flight included individuals who worked in the budget department in the Pentagon. The only way the narrative of some sort of conspiracy works is if we assume that the target was deliberate, which would mean the passengers on the plane would have had to be real victims as well. The strangest thing about this line of thought is that it matches up with other documented facts, such as the budget department investigating trillions of dollars that were unaccounted for. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The resolution of the video is so low it could be stay puft marsh mellow man rolling by. The pentagon could end any &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; over night as to what exactly hit the building by releasing the videos. But the fact they choose not to says it all really. My favourite part about the pentagon is the fact the Bush administration claimed they could have never invisioned such an attack. Whilst back in reality only a year previous they had done this drill,

    <div class="md"><p>The resolution of both videos is high enough to determine what the documentary calls the &quot;tail&quot; of the plane in one video as proof of a video hoax is nothing more than a building present in all frames. I think it&#39;s clear throughout the released content and the photographs that the damage resembles an airplane. At this point, I have to wonder why there has been so much misdirection to minimize the importance of the passenger list of the plane, which I now believe is likely a deliberate disinformation campaign. It&#39;s too suspicious for the people on site to be overwhelmingly in the budget and naval investigation departments, which happened to also be some of the Pentagon personnel on board of the flight. By completely disregarding the casualties on board, discourse in the conspiracy community neglects to connect the passengers to the overall event. If there is a conspiracy, we have to assume that the targets were deliberate, and if we assume the targets are deliberate, we have to assume the Naval and Budget department was the target. Strangely enough, this thought process alone eliminates the idea that it was something other than the plane that hit the Pentagon, because targets who were not at the Pentagon that day were on the flight that hit the Pentagon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? I don&#39;t think anyone is arguing a plane didn&#39;t hit the pentagon. The problem is the evidence doesn&#39;t fit that of the hijacked Boeing airliner. One can only assume the target was deliberate, because no one would pull off such an insane maneuver, to hit a part of the building that would cause the absolute least death/damage, and hit the only part that had recently been reinforced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I&#39;m so used to people thinking it was a missile that hit the Pentagon. What evidence implies that it was something other than the Boeing airliner? Despite the video&#39;s claim that the damage does not match up with the impact a plane would cause, the first floor of the building was severely damaged and the impact would fit an airplane the size of flight 77. And we certainly know that it had to be a plane, because the insane maneuver did happen, unless there are people (most likely those who contend it was a missile) who contend that the lightpoles knocked over were done after the incident occurred. We seem to agree that the target had to be deliberate, which, again, based on the passenger list, reinforces that it had to be flight 77. Interestingly enough, remote controlling an airliner was possible, and the technology was created by SPC, and for about 15 years, the CEO of SPC International was Dov Zakheim, who later went on to be part of the Council on Foreign Relations during the Bush administration and Comptroller at the Pentagon</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a side note the trillions of dollars aren&#39;t unaccounted for per se, that quote is out of context. Basically the DODs transaction system is so poor between different departments that it is near impossible to track without years of extensive work. So they aren&#39;t missing trillions just trillions are unauditable due to a poor transactions system and lack of consistency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s the difference between unaccounted for and &quot;cannot track&quot; as Rumsfeld said? It seems clear that this is not solely due to an &quot;inability to share information from floor to floor&quot; as some sort of technical error, rather, the Pentagon, as to be expected, was involved with fairly high cost black budget operations that is &quot;off the books&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey okay this gonna be a bit long and I will clarify if something doesn&#39;t make sense. Basically the DOD has to go through an independent audit and am internal audit. The internal audit is complete but the external( independent) needs to verify those numbers. So basically what happens is a team of auditors will need to come in and verify the numbers and this is where the issue lies. The auditors need to be able to say the numbers are correct, called reasonable assurance. This basically states that while the numbers are not correct to the penny they are correct within a range of material misstatement chosen by the auditor. What the auditors cannot do right now is provide reasonable assurance for a variety of reasons. Mainly because while documentation may be there, the auditors need more proof. Let&#39;s look at a few examples:</p>

<p>Fuel expense: so the DOD says it used X$ of fuel. The auditor needs to verify this, it can look at shipping records that is a good start. Purchase orders etc. But determining actual fuel used is really hard. Do military vehicles have odometers? Do servicemen record when vehicles were filled and mileage? Since the auditor cannot prove materiality no assurance is provided.</p>

<p>Inventory: usually a physical inventory provides best assurance, so a sample size can be used. The problem is usually how long it takes for the auditor to actually count everything, remember since the audit is independent they cannot always rely on what the DOD says.</p>

<p>Auditors also use %s to judge if an account is correct. So if they judge an account is 2% misstated and that is above their threshold, that account is unnaccounted for. This could be billions of dollars in an account.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t quite know for sure but a final problem may be how they account for destroyed and lost equipment. Thinking about the amount of equipment they may lose during combat I wonder if they have systems in place that can accurately track it for the auditor.</p>

<p>Plus many other reasons but from my experience in audit trying to do one of this scale would be impossible to account for. Were talking about trillions of assets, expenses, revenues. It would be hard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So your contention is that the trillions of dollars unaccounted for were not a total of a trillion, just multiple accounts with billions of assets tied to it, and only a few grand were unaccounted for, but the entire account is &quot;unaccounted&quot; for? Whether or not this is the case, that does not erase the strange coincidences that occur around the unaccounted for trillions, such as the budget and naval investigation wing being wiped out, as those were most of the casualties and the wing hit by the plane. The situation just becomes stranger when you consider that people on the plane were employed by the Pentagon as a budget analyst, which, at this point, does not seem like a mere coincidence. Couple this with the fact the comptroller in charge of investigating the unaccounted for trillions was the CEO of a company who developed the ability to remotely control aircraft and the unbelievable maneuvering of flight 77, and suddenly you have conflicts of interests in every direction and a story resembling a Hollywood film. These sorts of coincidences don&#39;t just happen on a daily basis and it&#39;s not worth discrediting the possibility of internal corruption to cover up illegal activity, especially since it&#39;s documented, despite the 9/11 Commission&#39;s claim, that there was advance knowledge of a terrorist attack. </p>

Whether it was coincidence or malice I don&#39;t think anyone will be able to say for certain but maybe time will tell.

<p>Something is clearly whispered. Some say she said, &quot;you did great&quot; others thinking, &quot;Let us pray&quot; and to me,  &quot;Its a frame&quot;.</p>

<p>But the phone call on the video seems to be cut short. Check out this version of the call which seems to be unedited. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiX7mNV4ab0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiX7mNV4ab0</a></p>

<p>Seems like to me, and this is purely speculative, that after she says, &quot;its a frame&quot; she drops the phone, you can here a &quot;sorry&quot;. Scrambles to pick up the phone and then it ends. </p>

<p>To me, it seems like someone was there monitoring the phone call. And as she handed the phone back without turning it off, she drops it and apologizes to whoever she was handing it to. Almost seems like it was intentional to drop it before handing it back to her captors. Her last act of civil disobedience. She is a hero. </p>

<p>Another thing to think about: How did she know about the 9/11 towers being struck with planes if she was in the air at the time? We&#39;re there news feeds on the plane? Doesn&#39;t seem likely. Even if others had contacted their loved ones, was news spreading among the passengers? Just seems really fishy. </p>

<p>granted it seems there is almost no background noise that one might expect from a plane, that portion of a call is muddled with noise and is already of a terrible quality. i feel like maybe it&#39;s people searching for something they have convinced themselves it&#39;s there.</p>

<p>further other people say it sounds like &quot;you did great&quot; and to me it sounds like someone says &quot;sorry&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have gone all over the spectrum on my beliefs around 9/11. I had finally rested on the the theory that it was hijackings by saudi nationals an that it was allowed to happen because of massive lapses in intelligence by the FBI &amp; CIA. I believed that to think otherwise was to be a tinfoil wearing loon. That the government is not capable of carrying out such a large scale attack on itself without people talking. The same reasoning I have used to justify that the moon landings are real, that to cover something that massive up would be next to impossible because someone would eventually spill the beans. But after watching this I feel like my whole world view has been turned on its head. I watched the whole thing in 2 days and I have to say its one of the most matter-of-fact doc&#39;s on the subject I have ever seen. I am blown away at how they dismantle the debunkers B.S. excuses point for point using science. When I search around the net, the same debunker B.S. still permeates, people touting the company lines that steel would be weakened from the intense heat yet they have proven that jet fuel burns at temperatures much lower than would be needed to melt the steel. Then when they get into the construction of WTC and how even the designer was on record saying the building could withstand the impact of a jetliner, well to me thats the nail in the coffin. These werent lego buildings. They were built to withstand pretty much anything that might accidentally happen to them yet watching that footage of them crumple like they were made of sand, that was the kicker for me. I must have replayed it about 50x. To deny that detonations were not used is to be willfully ignorant of facts. Has anyone read Behold the pale horse? What are your thoughts on the book? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the fucking fuck. This made complete fucking sense on a scientific level. I double checked all the fire data about steel having just taken a materials engineering class going over melting points and phase diagrams of steel and having taken a calculus driven physics classes the physics and engineering claims are fucking undeniable. </p>

<p>Does anybody have a good/solid video like the above that explains the events set into action by 9/11. I&#39;m talking about thorough information with refutes built in of analysis that goes beyond the headlines?</p>

<p>The videos suggested below me seen fucking redundant and useless when superior information is presented in a more compelling manner. I want to see a video that takes on the actions that happened after. Because I&#39;m willing to bet there is a geopolitical string of actions not apparent just by looking at the Iraq/Afghanistan war. </p>

<p>It&#39;s videos like this that gives credence to the notion of conspiracy going beyond tin foil hats and illogical arguments. No body can watch this video and not see the gains that were made for the cost. It&#39;s apparent why the actions that took place needed to happen, from why WTC needed to be taken down, and why only a small amount of the pentagon was damaged. How we needed an Alamo story to get us to optimistically go to war. And why we needed this cover to go to war, and commit massive troops. It makes sense who benefited from these actions and it makes sense as to the motivation of accosting human life. </p>

<p>Proud to be a member of this subreddit. Thanks for not making us seem like tin-foil hat wearing crazies who are foaming at the mouth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should read the book &#39;The New Pearl Harbor&#39; by David Ray Griffin. I could be entirely wrong, but without having watched the doc yet (I&#39;m at work), I don&#39;t think Dr. Griffin had any role with this film, aside from his own books of the same title being arguably the most comprehensive works on 9/11 and the resulting War on Terror. The book had two editions: the first book <em>The New Pearl Harbor: Disturbing Questions About the Bush Administration and 9/11</em> was published in 2004, while the second <em>The New Pearl Harbor Revisited: 9/11, the Cover-up, and the Expose</em> was published in 2008 after the 9/11 Commission Report was published.</p>

<p>While there are many avenues to consider when discussing the <strong>point</strong> behind 9/11, the biggest motivator is control. Why the Middle East? For natural resources, as was explained in the 1998 Project for A New American Century, a think tank that consisted of some of the most prominent members of the soon-to-be George W. Bush administration.</p>

<p>The other control is over people. The &quot;9/12 Mindset&quot; that has been referenced endlessly since 9/11 is a measure of fear. The fear of terrorism has lead to the creation of the biggest homeland security apparatus, defense budgets, global military campaigns, private military and security industry, and militarized law enforcement in the world, with the stated mission to stop terrorism. But the 13 years since 9/11, &quot;terrorism&quot; has gone from being defined as acts of violence intended to persuade a populace or society toward a given political, moral, ethical, or social ideology, to meaning anything that threatens the establishment/status quo, and the U.S. Department of Justice has published manuals for military and law enforcement that defines terrorism with terms such as &quot;conspiracy theorist, conservative, constitutionalist, environmentalist, military veteran, gun owner, libertarian, anarchist, socialist, communist, organic farming, homesteading, prepper, anti-war, anti-Federal Reserve,&quot; among many other terms that are largely associated with disenfranchisement, opposition to and lack of faith in the federal government, the monetary system, and the political parties. Labeling opposition as terrorists opens the doorways to an emerging police state where dissent, even verbal, can be legally construed as a crime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have not read the books yet (top of my reading list, though btw), I would say that there has to be something deeper than geopolitical control of oil resources and the 9/12 mindset. It leaves to many questions unanswered as to why just oil in that region when other places have a little less mature oil that is easier to get at. The remaining oil for that region is not that accessible. And it still does not explain Russia, and Israel well in that oil equation (Unless I&#39;m missing something, in which case please point me in the right direction). </p>

<p>I actually found it incredibly digestible considering it&#39;s length. The narrative format is nicely punctuated with questions as summaries of specific events of interest.</p>

<p>IMO this is, to date, the definitive 9/11 doc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree it gives the basic information that is well refuted and no extras. It raises the right questions and steers you along a path of further investigation. </p>

<p>For example it talks about the inability for those alleged to pilot the aircraft to the degree of excellence that it was. It did not go into the drone theory (highly controversial). It talked about facts of the attack, the mechanism of how the destruction took place (demolition not fire/gravity). It leaves out the really conspiracy stuff like the tenants of the WTC and their role in the conspiracy, it picks at the really surface level stuff that is obvious and undeniable. The owner of WTC bought it 4 months before attacks, insured it for a butt-load of money, the buildings suck due to Asbestos, too expensive to demolish and rebuild, ignoring the fact the city would never let an asbestos filled building be even demolished. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;drone theory&#39; is not that controversial, dov zakheim (of PNAC) ran a company that made the technology at the time. &#39;pod theory&#39; <em>is controversial</em> and i am not sure exactly why, since the &#39;pod&#39; makes a hole, its own hole, on the face of the tower when it hits. shadows and optical illusions don&#39;t do that......</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMayTWzOGY0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMayTWzOGY0</a></p>

<p>the reality is the &#39;pod&#39; is actually the closest thing we have to a smoking gun that the planes were modified or switched and hence proof the official story is b.s.</p>

<p>and i suspect that is why it gets so much <strong>controversy</strong>. use your eyes.</p>

<p>when you master the media you master the message. name any mainstream news source that has done anything other than read government press releases re: 9-11, or 7/7, for the last 13years? i can&#39;t think of one. maybe the shills can find an example to strawman my argument but i think we all know how little the media has done to probe 911. we especially know, since when you do probe it, yourself, applying some intelligence, it doesn&#39;t take much more than an hour or two to realise the official version is <strong>total bullshit.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m surprised there has not been a tidy list released of all the questions asked throughout the documentary.  What stands out about this documentary is the clear way it asks a question before beginning a new segment.  I&#39;ve searched but could not find one.</p>

<p>Once a list is made it could be put out there for people to see in easy formats.</p>

<p>It would be good to start the ball rolling and interesting to see if some or any of the questions can be debunked.</p>

<p>911 is the number we call to when we need help with something big and police/ambulance/firefighters need to be there. </p>

<p>If the USA really did plan the whole thing, then they must be planning something huge if they put it on a day like 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First time I&#39;ve seen this ever, and it was great. I watched a part a day over three days. It honestly raised some questions that I had never heard addressed or even thought of for that matter. The similarities between Pearl Harbor and 9/11 are absolutely stark and do point towards a deliberate lapse in intelligence and defense. </p>

<p>There were two points that I feel the documentary should have included. In other documentaries there were points about WTC-7 housing documents regarding ~$200 million dollar embezzlement involving an electric company and even information about who the core beneficiary of 9/11 is/was. Even though each aspect had a lot of depth, investigation and notable sources, I still would&#39;ve liked to see most of an analysis of &quot;post-9/11 America&quot;. Because that is where I truly believe the proof is in the pudding about a deliberate lapse in America&#39;s fundamental policies and procedures.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s sad to think, that if for arguments sake it was the ploy of a terrorist organisation, all of the changes in foreign policy, domestic policy, the enabling of the Patriot Act and complete justification of the NSA did exactly what terrorists would have wanted to happen to Western Society.  </p>

It was a personal tragedy for many families who lost someone, but in the larger view, we lose many more people to traffic accidents every year. The second, and greater embarrassment, is that we out of cowardice we acquiesced to the Patriot Act, the imposition of a police state with only a pretense of improved protection.

<p>remember, there are some conspiracy theorists would say that Pearl Harbor didn&#39;t happen the way we were told, so it&#39;s possibly accurate.  </p>

<p>in that it was an event that catalyzed a nation to support a war effort against Germany and Japan, I&#39;d say it&#39;s apt enough.</p>

The remaining oil for that region is not that accessible.
