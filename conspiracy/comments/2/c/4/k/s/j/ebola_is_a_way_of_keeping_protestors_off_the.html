    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ebola_outbreaks">It has &quot;spread&quot; several times before</a>, so thats nothing mew. Bit what is new is its scope. As of July 20th, about ten days ago, there were over 1200 cases with 673 deaths (giving a 56% mortality). The high amount of cases is unprecedented, bit the fact thst its an outbreak is not.</p>

<p>But regardless, i have always suspected ebola would eventually be unleashed to the public somehow. Though this current outbreak, in my opinion, seems to be natural. But thats not to say they camt facilitate its spread.</p>

<p>But anyways, why do you feel it will ne used against protestors? Is that a theory of yours? Or is there some source you have that made you come to that conclusion?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the other outbreaks were much smaller, this is the biggest and it&#39;s still growing.  The timing is perfect, as soon as protesters are about to orchestrate a coup, you scare the people back to their houses with an Ebola outbreak in the area i.e. people will then feel compelled to stay away from crowded areas.  Imagine if Ukraine had done this when their government was under siege, they would still have the old leaders in power.  Ebola is a tool, a highly effective one, it can be used to control the people through their fear; Ebola gives the shepherd complete control over his flock.</p>

<p>I put the emphasis on &quot;can&quot; because just because it is possible doesnt mean it is happening at the moment. I wont deny it, i just wont claim it as fact. Its certainly possible, and yes, it would be terrifyingly efficient as a tool used in such a manner as you propose.</p>

<p>Of an infectious disease?  Throughout human history, just about 100%.  This era is the most free of diseases of all sorts, ever.  We have so few that a disease that has killed ~700 people in 7 months, in africa of all places, makes international headlines and gets everybody&#39;s onions in a bunch.  </p>

<p>Even so, if you&#39;re concerned about ebola, you&#39;d better not think about the diseases that kill hundreds or thousands of times as many people every year as ebola has since its discovery.</p>

<p>Also what gave you the idea that anyone cares about protestors this millennium?  That&#39;s been designed out of the system for decades now.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Look at what the &#39;protestors&#39; did in Ukraine, look at what the &#39;protestors&#39; did in Libya.  &#39;Protestors&#39; are sometimes real and other-times being used as a means for regime change, often by another nation.  The US regularly uses this tactic on it&#39;s targets, who&#39;s to say that Russia wouldn&#39;t try the same on a Western nation, especially during a time when trust in the Western leadership is at an all time low.</p>

<p>Also of note is that one of the head doctors who was &quot;on the front lines fighting the outbreak&quot; <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/29/health/ebola-doctor-dies/">died at Kenema Government Hospital</a>.  He was no small fry either - the article describes him as one of the world leaders in treating hemorrhagic fevers.</p>

<p>It appears that both George Soros and Bill &amp; Melinda Gates have provided funding to the hospital/lab.  And we know what their thoughts on &quot;population control&quot; are...</p>
