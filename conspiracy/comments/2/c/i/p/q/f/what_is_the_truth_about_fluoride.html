    <div class="md"><p>many ppl now believe fluoride isn&#39;t beneficial to health,
not only is it in tap water, but also naturally in foods:</p>

<p>you&#39;ve no doubt heard how the population has been &#39;dumbed down&#39;? many think it is <em>because</em> of the fluoride we have been ingesting (not realizing what it&#39;s doing) because we&#39;ve been told it&#39;s &quot;good&quot; for dental health,</p>

<p>in the end i think it makes sense to not to eat/drink chemicals, but that&#39;s my opinion - you can remove fluoride from your drinking water, 
the link below is one i purchased a water pitcher from, some ppl like the distilled water system, it really is a personal decision, </p>

There has to be something to the rumors/studies we have seen.  I don&#39;t use it anymore, I use organic toothpaste and filter my water.  If it is bad for us, it could be that this topic has been treated like several others, where doctors are basically brainwashed into believing something is good or not dangerous to people.  Then, later it is discovered that the conspiracy &#39;nuts&#39; were right and it is bad.  Biggest idea is to follow the money, who stands to gain from fluoride being in everything?  Who is profiting from it?  Johnson &amp; Johnson or one of the other conglomerates?  They have their own set of lobbyists pushing fluoride products.  I don&#39;t know, this is a difficult and highly argued subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fluorosylicilic acid is a waste product from fertilizer production. Fertilizer companies researched ways to efficiently dispose of or utilize it. They were interested in previous research which evidenced fluorides as beneficial to tooth enamel when applied TOPICALY. They cited naturally occuring fluorides in a few water supplies as evidence that all water supplies could be safely fluoridated.</p>

<p>TLDR1: Fertilizer companies had a financial interest. They arrived at a false conclusion that drinking fluorides was safe and beneficial to tooth enamel. Drinking fluorides has been shown in the following decades to have no measurable beneficial impact on tooth enamel.</p>

<p>And so, fertilizer companies began efforts to lobby for water fluoridation, in an attempt to sell their fluorosylicilic acid waste to municipal water facilities.</p>

<p>Even still, water fluoridation may not have come to be.  But then came the Manhattan Project, accidentally leaking fluoride waste into New Jersey lakes and water supplies, killing off many species of fish. There was likely to be a controversy of nuclear proportions. They scrambled for a solution, and found one in the research and lobbying of fertilizer companies. They championed water fluoridation as a modern health miracle, and streamlined the start of nationwide water fluoridation. Fluorine became a celebriy overnight, and suddenly the story of fluorides polluting New Jersey&#39;s water supplies (at a level now &quot;shown&quot; to be safe and even BENEFICIAL) became a joke and disappeared.</p>

<p>TLDR2: The Manhattan Project accidentally spilled fluorides into water supplies in New Jersey. When looking for solutions, they discovered flawed research that claimed fluoride wastes in water was a safe and beneficial situation, so they endorsed it to makebtheir own mistake wash away.</p>

<p>As it turns out, Grand Rapids, Michigan was not the site of the onset of a breakthrough in dental health. The Lancet Journal has recently redefined fluorosylicilic acid as a neurotoxin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fluoride is a &quot;by product&quot; or &quot;waste product&quot; of several industrial processes, mainly aluminium production. The distinction is key. If it&#39;s a waste product it&#39;ll be a huge blow to the industry as they&#39;ll have to deal with disposal, however if it&#39;s a by-product that they can sell they&#39;ll make even more money. The industrialists were very powerful with deep pockets and they hired an expert at PR.</p>

<p>The addition of fluoride to the American water supply was implemented by the master propogandist Bernays. Look him up, his career resume includes campaigns to get more women to smoke cigarettes and to overthrow the democratically elected government of Guatemala for the united fruit company, clearly the guy would have no ethical qualms about doing something harmful. </p>

<p>As for the medical effects, the effect of fluoride on teeth was first seen in areas contaminated by Aluminium waste. These areas were correlated with reduced cavities, but also the effects of fluoride toxicity. Bernays and his team were successful at pitching the idea that cavities could be reduced by municipalities buying fluoride. Like his advocacy of cigarettes, the harmful effected of fluoride were ignored.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s the most reasonable explanation for why so many places fluoridated their water. There is strong evidence now that flouride can decrease IQ, and calcifies the pineal gland.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A study in 1997 concluded sodium-fluoride exposure has i&#39;ll effects on rodents.</p>

<p><strong>From the study</strong></p>

<p>Sodium–fluoride administerd to rats cause alterations in neuronal and cerebrovascular integrity. Rats administered with 0.5 ppm (or .5 mg per liter) of fluoride exhibited a greater susceptibility to illness and had a higher mortality rate after 52 weeks of exposure.</p>

<p>These animals revealed a significant reduction in the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20554850">neuronal density</a> (number of cells) in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus">hippocampus</a> on the left hemisphere in the brain. Lowered IQ is a result of this.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fluoride-class-action.com/wp-content/uploads/varner-1998-chronic-administration-of-aluminum-fluoride-208.109.172.241-health-brain-varner-1998.pdf">source</a></p>

<p>Also the EPA allows up to 4mg of fluoride per liter. Much of the toothpaste sold in the United States has 1 mg of sodium fluoride. These are considerably higher doses than what was given to rats that were affected by a very low dose.</p>

<p>There are two types of fluoride that can be in your water.</p>

<p>Sodium fluoride is a toxic byproduct of several industries and is added 
to many municipal water supplies in the United States.
Sodium fluoride is hazardous to your health.</p>

<p>Calcium fluoride occurs naturally in many water sources and is not
