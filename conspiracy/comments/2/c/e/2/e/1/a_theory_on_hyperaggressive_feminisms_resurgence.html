        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With all the political correctness insanity currently spreading, I&#39;d like to put forward a theory.  Feminism as a tool of the monied interests. </p>

<p>Political times are volatile to say the least.  One trip through <a href="/r/conservative">/r/conservative</a> or <a href="/r/liberal">/r/liberal</a>, for example, will prove this beyond a doubt.  </p>

<p>Anyone who lived through the Vietnam era, in America, will recognize the combination of political turmoil, hostile conflict and a hyper-aggressive feminist movement.  </p>

<p>Was it the time and age itself that led to the cultural revolution?  The natural order of progression as a species?  Or was it something else?  </p>

<p>On May 21 1979 <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Village_Voice">The Village Voice</a> carried an article by Nancy Borman entitled <em>Gloria Steinem and the CIA</em>. See <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/ctrl@listserv.aol.com/msg02217.html">here</a>.  <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redstockings">Redstocking</a> feminists purportedly came across connections between Gloria Steinem and the CIA.  <a href="http://bfeldman68.blogspot.com/2007_08_12_archive.html?m=1">See here for alleged details about that</a>. Allegedly, Steinem was bankrolled by the agency. Including Ms. </p>

<p>Now for arguments sake, I&#39;m going to assume that the reason the CIA would want 1960s feminism to run amok is distract,  divide, conquerer.  Antiwar protests are problematic.  The CIA wouldn&#39;t want the protests against the war to continue or grow.  Too much money involved in war.  Peace is broke.  Also, there was the whole drug smuggling thing.  Money again.  Split the group with aggressive one-sided ideology. </p>

<p>Which brings me to my point.   Hyper-insane feminism has returned, worse than ever, under the Social Justice Warrior banner.  Promoting segregation; living by the ubermensch/untermensch mentality; thought policing; the whole nine.  </p>

<p>Why has it come back?  Well, if we assume for arguments sake that some/all of the above is true, there could be only one reason why it&#39;s back.  Money is threatened. </p>

<p>But where&#39;s my proof?  My proof is more philosophical, in that it is based on where it is showing up.  Not simply that feminism exists.  Nothing wrong with feminism.  Anything can be co-opted and corrupted.  Where are the hot spots.  Colleges (anyone ever meet a college student that didn&#39;t know everything? Combine that with thought policing authority), internet (anonymous influence), atheism (atheism+, anyone?).  </p>

<p>...and Occupy.  </p>

<p>Does anyone remember <a href="http://uproxx.com/tv/2011/11/oh-so-this-is-why-some-people-hate-occupy-wall-street/">this</a>?  <em>&quot;Ketchup&quot;, the female-bodied person...</em>  Why in the hell would Occupy choose to not put it&#39;s best fucking foot forward?  Because a group of people with an ulterior agenda got involved and managed to some their way into the spot somehow.  To paraphrase InternetAristocrat, once the SJWs got involved it shifted focus and diverted it&#39;s attention to &quot;inclusiveness&quot; and setting up &quot;no rape zones.&quot;  There went the community binding agent- our economy.  </p>

<p>This is about the time that the msm started to pay attention.  But what did we see on TV.  Pot smoking bongo circles, dreads and &quot;no rape zones&quot;.  The entire original message, the whole fucking point, was gone.  This was now the face of Occupy.  Drugs and rape. And rape.  Did I mention rape? </p>

<p>I remember watching a video where a zuccotti park resident said in back to back statements that the rape zones were necessary to provide a feeling of security, but that no one hour raped that they knew of.  </p>

<p>WTF is that shit?  What message are you sending? </p>

<p>The Colbert spot simply snuffed out the last ember of hope to reach a large audience with its message.  It didn&#39;t matter what she (&quot;Ketchup&quot;) said after her introduction.  Normal TV viewers tuned her out after that.  </p>

<p>What feminism (read as &#39;social justice&#39;) did to the movement was, divide it internally (those focusing on the economic issues vs those with an agenda), paint it as full of rapists who rape so much there needs to be designated zones of safety, and full of jobless druggies.   Then finally kill it with the &quot; I don&#39;t know what the hell a &quot;female-bodied person&quot; is, so this movement isn&#39;t for me &quot; appearance.  SJWs defeated the greatest threat to Wall Street ever.  </p>

<p>And with that Wall Street won, and the theft of our economy continued.  Now under the protective banner of &quot;-isms.&quot; </p>

<p>TL:DR - Feminism helped save Wall Street. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or, you know, being a female that was born in the 80s, hit adolescence in the 90s and watched the explosion of hyper-sexual females (Brittany, Xtina, that Kardashian thing) and the simultaneous birth of the angry white man-child, I&#39;d kinda say &quot;hyper feminism&quot; is the result of (a) parents &amp; educators expecting highly career-minded women, (b) men expecting pornography-programmed libido, (c) society expecting irrational consumer and personal hygiene behaviors and (d) the medical/pharma industry expecting women to stay sane &amp; healthy while throwing drugs &amp; hormones at every &quot;problem&quot;. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t think it&#39;s hard to be a woman these days? Go ask a pre-teen, teenage, 20something, 30something and post-menopausal woman what it&#39;s like &quot;these days&quot;... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. I&#39;m a few years older than you, I feel like I somehow hit the lottery. Out of college during the dot-com boom and while I dealt with a lot of sexism, it&#39;s not nearly as awful as what I&#39;m seeing happen to the young women I know now are dealing with. It&#39;s a mighty motivator to continue to find a way to stay self-employed, that&#39;s for sure.</p>

<p>Although I am really beginning to doubt the first part of your (d) - middle-aged women are disappearing from our lives at a record pace, thanks to the US medical industry. Firstline treatment for a lot of &quot;pain diseases&quot; (some as easy to fix as a vitamin deficiency or food allergy, but with horrible symptoms that just get lumped into a word like &quot;fibromyalgia&quot;) is straight to the opiates. Side effect addiction, side effect cancer, side effect suicide. I&#39;ve lost two loved ones to this that I know of, probably more as people keep things hush-hush when there&#39;s a suicide. </p>

<p>A serious natural resource disappearing before our very eyes. We&#39;re losing so much, so many reasonable thinkers who should be in the prime of their lives, making a difference. We&#39;re losing so much wisdom! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then wtf was the point of feminism? According to them it was hard for women when they spent most of their time in domestic deeds and their family was their life. According to you it&#39;s hard for women now when they&#39;re expected to and are encouraged to go out into the world and pursue careers of their choice.  When will it not be &quot;hard to be a woman&quot; then?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think even women know and just like to think that they have it hard. I&#39;ve noticed women are drawn to the victim mindset. Feminism can keep moving aggressively but I guarantee most women still won&#39;t be happy and I&#39;m starting to think that women can&#39;t truly be happy for a sustained period time, all other things the same. Something mentally will always get in the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understand what feminism is. I suspect you don&#39;t care, but feminism is strictly the quest for equality of the sexes. We&#39;ll never get it, humans suck, both men and women, so I assume the movement will always exist and will always need to exist. </p>

<p>For some reason, the notion of simple equality causes some men to go ballistic, I&#39;m not quite sure why; a wise older woman once clued me into why so many of the wonderful men we know occasionally went inexplicably batshit when a woman succeeded (a lifetime homemaker and fabulous mother; she could have run companies, too, but chose to care for her family--which is part of feminism, too. This misguided notion that, if you&#39;re a feminist, you must believe that all women must work, that&#39;s bunk. It&#39;s equality, pure and simple): &quot;It&#39;s just insecurity. That&#39;s what&#39;s behind it all.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the equality part and I&#39;m for it, but often it&#39;s derailed and its pursuit is not always done honestly (see he recent wage gap claims). Also it&#39;s not always men who complain about women, it&#39;s other women. If a woman is propped up for some achievement, you will quickly see the feminists of tumblr or some blog out to bring her down in some way or say some shit like &quot;women shouldn&#39;t be expected to do this, this is a bad message for the average woman!&quot;.  On the other hand if like in your example, some career woman decides to forgo her career to support her family, there will be outrage from them over that.</p>

<p>Anyways, what I&#39;m talking about is solely the happiness of women, which regardless of the status/progress of feminism or of women&#39;s ever-expanding role outside of the home, seems to either be staying at the same levels or decreasing. I don&#39;t think women can truly be happy on an individual level or as a group. There will always be &quot;something&quot; missing if you talk to them that would make them happy again. This is seen even in long term, stable marriages and it&#39;s backed by the drastic differences between male and female anti-depressant use. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know any men that are truly happy on an individual level or as a group? Because I sure don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Can you cite the male vs. female anti-depressant use being higher and/or being caused by women being the only unhappy ones? Depression is often caused by nutritional and other deficiencies and antidepressants are the firstline response of most doctors - but you need to go to a doctor and admit to being depressed to get one prescribed. </p>

<p>I never said discrimination was solely men&#39;s fault, it&#39;s weird how guys seem to jump to thinking they&#39;re being blamed when you mention the &quot;F&quot; word. That women sabotage women is no secret and no reason for feminism to disappear - rather a reason for it to continue to exist. Both men and women perpetuate bullshit, I actually would go so far as to say ALL men and women perpetuate bullshit - even if you try to treat all people equally, it just doesn&#39;t happen. Women are as sexist, racist, ageist, heightist, etc as men. Which is why it&#39;s good to realize it, because we can go, &quot;Oh, shit, my bad, sorry&quot; and fix it vs. digging deeper in. Most women (and men) I know don&#39;t give anyone shit for women (or men!) choosing to work or stay home and take care of the kids. It&#39;s a financial and personal decision.</p>

<p>I would exempt tumblr or some blog from the discussion, it&#39;s irrelevant and a bad excuse to throw feminism out with the bathwater - all about page views, not improving people&#39;s daily lives (well, I guess it improves the publishers&#39; lives).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t seen much real &quot;hyper aggressive feminism&quot; out in the real world. I have seen some shit, though. I dealt with a lot of discrimination, sexual harassment, and beyond that -- but I did pretty well for myself despite all of that and I had a LOT less to deal with than my mother had to deal. Unfortunately, from what I&#39;m observing, young women now have way more sexism to deal with than I ever did. We&#39;re actually going backwards, which is depressing as fuck. </p>

<p>Feminism is resurging because people got lazy and mistreatment of people based on gender, race, age, and even height (!) has gotten really overt (you tall, young white men who may have the world at your feet in the workplace now, prepare for age discrimination in the workplace - because I&#39;m watching my father&#39;s generation go through that, and it&#39;s tough). And the young men growing up today never cease to shock me, the things coming out of their mouths towards women, young and old. Just, what the fuck, dudes. Would you talk like that to your mother? Oh, you would? Jesus. I would blame their parents, but you gotta stop blaming parents after you leave home. But that&#39;s honestly my hypothesis as to where it&#39;s coming from. You didn&#39;t disrespect an elder or a woman when I was a kid or else you couldn&#39;t sit for a week. I don&#39;t think a lot of kids have to deal with that anymore (thank the State, I guess, and the fear of losing your kids for a spanking, just nuts). Lucky for the kids at that point in time, and parents, too, because what parent really wants to spank a kid? But it&#39;s turning out kind of horrible for society as a whole--and tough for boys when they leave the roost and find the world doesn&#39;t kow-tow to them the way their mothers did.</p>

<p>Edit: By &quot;Real world&quot; - I mean not Internet. I do see aggressive &quot;fuck you&quot; feminism on the Internet, but I think it&#39;s actually the opposite of what you&#39;re saying - the toxic stuff pushes people away from feminism without even understanding what it is (like those poor girls who say they&#39;re against feminism because they want to be stay-at-home moms, which indicates they don&#39;t even know what feminism is or why it exists), thus making everything even better for those sexist rich guys with the stupid aprons running around playing fuck-the-world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Preface: Let me go on record again (I mentioned this in the post itself).  There is nothing wrong with fighting for equality.  Nothing wrong with feminism, per se.  The problem arises with the co-opting and agenda steering.   There&#39;s nothing wrong with equal work for equal pay.  There&#39;s something drastically wrong with policing thought, no matter how offensive the thoughts and ideas are.  Offense is subjective. </p>

<p>Black panthers and feminist organizations got infiltrated.  Panthers at least recognized this fact and dealt with it.  Feminists couldn&#39;t every admit that they were/are being used.  </p>

Don&#39;t go at them full blast with what you&#39;re saying up there, because they hear that, they&#39;re not going to be honest about things--but, as an experiment, steer the conversation towards some modern example of abuse (unfortunately, there are too many) and just listen receptively to what they might say about it. You&#39;ll be shocked. And maybe sickened. You know why there&#39;s a lot of talk about rape? Because there&#39;s a lot of fucking rape. </p>

<p>stratified, with any cause you get various levels of obsession and concern.</p>

<p>at the top there are the hyper focused and combative types, they want their group to win no matter the cost.</p>

<p>then theres the more rational and real world types, this tends to become the mainstream, but ideas and concerns from the top level will percolate through the mainstream.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re wrong.   Very way hell and gone wrong.  </p>

<p>The renewed interest of and by women toward working to protect women&#39;s rights -- our individual liberty and equal right under law -- is a direct backlash from and response to the Republican right-wing-nut campaign to impose primitive theocratic &quot;traditions&quot; that make women subservient to men and little more than obedient housekeepers and baby making machines.</p>

<p>The actual owners of the GOP brand are the greediest of the wealthiest of the investor class -- a permanent minority without a &quot;follower class&quot; to give them political clout at the polls needed to effect their pro corporate anti actual human person agenda.  The Republican courting of &quot;values voters&quot; -- religious zealots that can be moved by single issue political campaigns --  is in trade for those votes.  </p>

<p>Republican &quot;leadership&quot; -- and I use that term loosely -- have abandoned the libertarian wing of the Republican party -- abandoned  support for actual individual liberty and equal right under law for individual persons.  Now, to a Republican, freedom only seems to apply to their money -- the unregulated pursuit of profits and the untaxed hoarding thereof.  Even the gun freedom supported by Republicans seems to be more about profits for the military industrial complex than freedom.  The Republican version of religious freedom -- because they refuse to include freedom FROM religion -- is pathetic and results in a pro-theocratic tyranny platform.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What feminists refer to as &quot;patriarchy&quot; was actually a system that held women up on a pedestal, saved them from working themselves to an early grave and gave them the freedom to develop their own interests, such as poetry and literature, etc.  Feminism has destroyed the family unit, killed countless children, and made it so women are now forced to work to support a family.  But hey, that&#39;s &quot;equality&quot; right?  That&#39;s what you get.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a woman, I strongly disagree.  </p>

<p>Granted, yes, perhaps some women may have been put &quot;on a pedestal&quot; -- when the men in their life were in that mood and/or if the men in their lives could afford to hire help. </p>

<p>Especially before modern appliances, most women had child after child after child while their bodies never really fully recovered -- they did not have the time off to recover.  </p>

<p>Most women worked from sunrise to sunset and beyond --  all day long doing all the work needed in the home -- much more so if they lived on a farm --  cooking and house cleaning and mending and sewing and working in the garden and canning and feeding livestock and milking the cow and churning butter  -- AND  they were on call for crying babies 24/7.   They wore themselves out.  When hubby came home, they were also on call to serve and service him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, if hubby was a farmer, then, yes, he&#39;d do some of the more strenuous farm work -- but not usually all of it.  The women would hoe the garden and pick the veggies as well w/babies in tow.  If not a farmer, then hubby would usually work his &quot;day job&quot; and come home and relax w/newspaper and expect to be waited on.</p>

<p>Most women didn&#39;t drive until WWII or have money of their own -- many never did.  Many women married very young and without much education, often, though certainly not always, to older men and usually not without the approval of their family.  </p>

<p>There was usually no time and/or no money for other interests or opportunity to socialize -- except, of course, religion, church, weddings, funerals, baptisms, christenings and the like.</p>

<p>Most importantly, they usually had little choice in what they could do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its called read a fucking history book.  Women were respected and given priority status in society.  Men fought in wars to protect the women and children, they didn&#39;t send the women out to die.  The whole idea of &quot;women&#39;s equality&quot; is propaganda used to rile up half of the population.  Women have always been the other half of men, as in the ying-yang concept, each has its own strengths and weaknesses and are utilized in society as such.  Women and men are fundamentally different and societies in the past have known this and had the men working the hard labor and women at home tending to the children and the garden at home.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never heard of him, but a brief search on him indicates no, I probably wouldn&#39;t have read him even if I had heard of him.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll let you go back to thinking that the olden days were perfect happy places where menfolk treated ladyfolk like goddesses and those ladyfolk who couldn&#39;t done be getting them some manfolk just killed themselves in good stead, making both the manfolk and the womanfolk happy again.</p>

<p>But if you can take a few minutes to let me know your sources on this weird Utopia of the past where men and women treated each other with universal respect, I&#39;d appreciate it. I mean, an alternate history might make my day, it&#39;d be good to read something <em>positive</em> for once, even if it&#39;s a fairy tale. Still can&#39;t believe this is what they&#39;re teaching y&#39;all in schools these days, though. Maybe go visit a nursing home and talk to the folks there if you can&#39;t find the right book. A good education and would be a pretty positive learning experience for you and would make someone&#39;s day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its funny that you&#39;re trying to belittle me by assuming that I&#39;m some sort of backwoods hick.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re assuming that since women didn&#39;t own property and didn&#39;t have jobs that they were somehow repressed.  Which is funny.  Men wanted to shield them from that responsibility and stress.  Yes women worked at home, they were happy there, women are nurturers BIOLOGICALLY, the mother of the family was not &quot;expected&quot; or &quot;forced&quot; to work at home, they chose to because that is, biologically, what they knew they were best suited for, biologically.  Imagine the women working and the men at home, you know <em>breastfeeding</em> children.  Oh yeah, that&#39;s something that can happen.  But oh, that&#39;s repression right?  Biology?  Forced gender roles right?  Hunter-Gatherer societies repressed women by forcing them to stay back at the teepee and supervise/protect the children while the men were out attempting to catch food.  REPRESSION!!!!!</p>

<p>A good example of this, is my SO.  She is all feminist hoorah, women&#39;s studies type, that is, until we had a child.  Now she wants me to be the sole breadwinner, she says she would rather not work and stay at home and get this, she used this word &quot;NEST&quot;.  I must be REPRESSING her, and holding her down because she wants to mother and tend to the home right?  Dumb prick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re confused and you still don&#39;t know what feminism even <em>is.</em> Equality is about choice. If you want to stay home, bully for you. If she wants to stay home, bully for her. Feminism is about being able to do that, having the freedom to do either. Being forced to stay home and take care of kids (newsflash--100 years ago, not all women were able to marry or have kids, just like today) is not some awesome utopia. Choosing to stay home is.</p>

<p>Sounds like you have some personal stuff that is affecting your understanding of what we&#39;re discussing here and ability to not resort to namecalling, so I&#39;m out. Good luck.</p>
