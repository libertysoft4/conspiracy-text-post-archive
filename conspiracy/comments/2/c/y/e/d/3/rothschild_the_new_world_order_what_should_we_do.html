        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Is everyone ready? I suppose that question is rhetorical.
Humans are the great &quot;explainers&quot; of the universe. We make sense out of things that do not require explaining. We create an answer for a why when there is no why. We only see in 3-Dimensions. We live linear lives in accordance to &#39;time&#39;. Everything that happens, happens and that&#39;s the way it is.</p>

<p>Most of the world has been run by the rich for quite some time now. It can date back hundreds of years, if not more, where rich families like the Rothchild&#39;s or the Rockefeller&#39;s came to the throne of Earth. For a Rothchild... depopulation is nature.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t get into how America&#39;s economy is being ruined because of the privately owned Federal Reserve or if there are outer world connections with the government - Rather, I&#39;d like to address the civilians of the world. Where do we come in? Must we submit to the New World Order or can we recognize the idea known as &#39;hope&#39;?</p>

<p>America should be recognized as the threat to the entire world. America is a Warmongering country in search for resources that are still left on this planet and when America gets denied, they invade. When America recognizes someone with power in the country as a threat, they eliminated them. (JFK) When America needs support of it&#39;s own country to go to war, they create an inner threat. (9/11)</p>

<p>I want to throw this up for discussion. All opinions welcome but I&#39;m hoping for serious responses. The reason I don&#39;t make this thread &#39;serious&#39; is because even though some ideas sound ridiculous, it is still important to have an open mind and remember anything is possible.</p>

<p>If you believe the corruption in America is real, then what do you believe civilians should do, if they can do anything? When the New World Order comes, where do you think depopulation will take place? Do you believe that there is a concept of &#39;good&#39; and &#39;evil&#39;, and if so which do you believe our future holds? Are you aware America has built concentration camps? Are you aware America&#39;s space program is a joke especially after learning about solar energy use which it has been known for years? Any feedback of relevance to this post works too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We wait, we talk, we spread information, we love each other.  We treat others how we would like to be treated.  </p>

<p>And when the time comes, we meet up in a big group, go to their mansions, drag them out by the hair, and string them up in a tree by their necks.  Then we hold a constitutional convention, re-ratify our amendments, hold a new election, and dissolve all mass media corporations.  We know their names, we know where they live.  We just need a catalyst.</p>

<p>By the people, for the people.  I&#39;m doing everything I can to make this happen in my lifetime.</p>

<p>&quot;God forbid we should ever be 20 years without such a rebellion. The people can not be all, and always, well informed. The part which is wrong will be discontented in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive. If they remain quiet under such misconceptions it is a lethargy, the forerunner of death to the public liberty. We have had 13 states independant 11 years. There has been one rebellion. That comes to one rebellion in a century and a half for each state. What country ever existed a century and a half without a rebellion? And what country can preserve it&#39;s liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? <strong>The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.</strong> It is it&#39;s natural manure.&quot;</p>

<p>Elections are part of the rulebook set by the enemy to ensure they always win the game, sooner or later, it&#39;s beyond vulnerable... however you are spot on about the constitutional convention, but think outside of the box when you get there (actually start now), you need something that can&#39;t be corrupted, by design, and elections are everything but that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m surprised that so few people mention Iceland in these threads. Their banking system experienced one of the biggest crashes by any country ever. The people revolted and took back their country (they actually forced their government to resign).</p>

<p>Obviously the western media have tried to keep a lid on this as they don&#39;t want us knowing that it can be done, and I am almost certain that if Iceland was a Central/South American country, the the US government would have tried their hardest to obstruct this (like they (successfully) did with Chile, Guatemala, El Salvador, etc.). I think our problem (UK &amp; US), though, is that our economies and political systems are so inherent to the global corruption (Rothchilds, Royal Family, etc.) that taking back our countries might prove to be an entirely different kettle of fish to Iceland.</p>

<p>As for dealing with the aftermath of the impending collapse, I would recommend researching basic survival skills (the SAS books are really good for this) and also what happens in times of an economic collapse (I would recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Modern-Survival-Manual-Surviving/dp/9870563457">The Modern Survival Manual: Surviving the Economic Collapse</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/When-All-Hell-Breaks-Loose/dp/142360105X/ref=pd_sim_b_1/277-4927776-1437629?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;refRID=1JZVKRXF380H86K037AY">When All Hell Breaks Loose: Stuff You Need to Survive When Disaster Strikes</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Iceland is one of the finest examples of how it should be done..  but when one really start diggin into the facts and actually listen to the people of Iceland, you realize that nothing has changed.. Absolutely NOTHING..  It just started all over again, and new individuals have taken over where the others left..  Unfortunately there&#39;s a lot of disinformation and fake rumors about what happened in Iceland.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe we should disband the federal government, <a href="http://youtu.be/YNg_rgbIQZs?list=UUwziJkP7NJzkaJs2bHmyKVw">I would suggest a massive act of civil disobedience,</a> and just resume governance on localized levels. I&#39;d push for a blockchain-type currency, whether it&#39;s Bitcoin or some other version, something transparent, and a blockchain model towards governance. No more voting since it is rigged. Everything has to be transparent and public and available online. No more forced taxation or licensing for plumbers and fishing or shit like that.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I&#39;d push for a stateless society, since I concur with Arundhati Roy when she said, <strong>&quot;Flags are bits of colored cloth that governments use first to shrink-wrap people&#39;s brains and then as ceremonial shrouds to bury the dead.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen.. you should start looking in the right direction.
Yes you are getting VERY distracted by the main stream media..  BUT you are also getting distracted from &quot;the real deal&quot;, when getting sucked into the rabbithole of fustration/fear/anger of why these things continue to happen. Look where Michael C. Ruppert ended, deeply sucked into depressions and anger. I have lost a LOT of friends myself when trying to tell them whats going on in the world.</p>

<p>Even if one of us found the magic solution and the world found out about the truth of the &quot;elite&quot;, I&#39;m a afraid that a new and possibly even bigger problem would occur over time. Remember natural law..  and law of attraction.</p>

They would get nothing out of wiping most of us out or putting us under total control they already have half the money in the world and it gives them all the power in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What we should do is try to be happy and ignore these people and their &quot;power&quot;.
People will always suffer, if not at the hands of a Rothchild than some other guy, even if we deconstruct all of the social and economical power we&#39;d just move the oppressor closer to home.</p>

<p>But if you really really want to fuck with them, just be close to them, what they hate is people being around them, be like Alex Jones and haunt them where ever they go, peel away the layers between us and them, humanize their security, erode their loyalties until the only people they can trust are like them, emotionless robots filled with a quiet distaste for humanity.</p>

<p>If you want to fuck with their system than just opt out, go off the grid while on the grid, if they evict you squat your own house, banks don&#39;t have people to live in your home, if the police come to evict you just leave and come back later, force them to commit amazing amounts of passive man power to trivial tasks.
Involve your local community, not in a political sense but more like a neighbourhood watch that protects you from the police by coming out of their homes when they are forcing you out of yours.</p>

<p>If you desire a more proactive and violent course of action just kill cops, do it quietly and without drama, don&#39;t give them a means to spin it, poison is very bland and uninteresting news wise at least compared to gun or blade violence, it can be placed into food and drink, even on your drivers licence, (wear gloves) poison is easy to obtain if you&#39;re creative and even if they don&#39;t die making them sick and mistrust the public is really all you&#39;d need.</p>

<p>At the end of the day America is just people who participate and condone in the system, we just need enough of them to abandon the idea of America and embrace a world view without borders and oversight from above.</p>

<p>All their power is your power, you use their money, fly their planes, drive their cars, live in their homes, go to their jobs, without you the whole thing falls apart.</p>

<p>But that brings us back to the first part, the best revenge is to live well.
Its never been a matter of what we should do, its always been about what we should stop doing.</p>

<p>These people thrive on the idea that we all together can stop them but the truth is that we as individuals acting autonomously according to our own ideas create a far more damaging environment, a mass of people is easy to manipulate but the individual acting out of personal motivation is far more difficult to mold and shape into a willing slave.</p>

<p>The individual is the only one who holds the key to their chains.
Emancipate yourself from mental slavery, none but ourselves can free our mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch and wait, learn and educate. Prepare yourself mentally and physically, prepare your friends and loved ones as much as possible. Build honest relationships with those around you, so as things escalate you will have a community you can rely on and that will rely on you.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let yourself be locked in to a single concept of how things will play out in the future. It is an ever changing landscape at the moment as our understanding of the situation develops, make varied plans to protect your interests from the many different scenarios that are possible within your lifetime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s not just the US, it&#39;s also the UK (working together) </p>

<p>there was a study that proved that some of the wealthy become less caring, &quot;How Wealth Reduces Compassion&quot;,</p>

<p><a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-wealth-reduces-compassion/">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-wealth-reduces-compassion/</a></p>

<p>so in that sense it is &quot;evil&quot; to allow others to suffer (&#39;let them eat cake&#39; &amp; die),</p>

<p>i think depopulation has <em>always</em> been happening, we&#39;re just aware of it now, in the past not many ppl ever questioned the reason for wars, pandemics, or &quot;natural&quot; disasters. </p>

<p>imo corporations dictate why we pay for energy, imagine having <em>free</em> clean energy? corp&#39;s can&#39;t reveal the cures for diseases because the pharmaceuticals wouldn&#39;t get paid &amp; the point is to allow ppl to die, </p>

<p>realizing there&#39;s so much that is wrong, there is no simplistic resolution;
the world <em>may be</em> reaching a tipping point, my opinion is we should:</p>

<p>demand that are foods not have unnecessary chemicals (stop Monsanto)</p>

<p>stop drinking/eating fluoridated foods (that seems impossible), i think that detoxing out bodies will effect how we think; about others including animals &amp; the earth,</p>

<p>curtail the constant use of antibiotics, promote other ways to boost the immune system,</p>

<p>people have to be more involved in the process (we have become lazy) <em>of being aware</em>, we have been made passive by zoning out watching tv, we DON&#39;T read anymore &amp; believing the lies (how to overcome the &#39;brainwashing&#39; would start with changing diet &amp; we know how difficult that is, McD&#39;s would go out of business),</p>

<p>reducing chemical use &amp; pollutants will help repair the environment,</p>

<p>i really do think ppl will revolt, but we can&#39;t win fighting against <em>the Machine</em> with their <em>new</em> weapons (electronic, bio) that will be (are now being) used against us, it will be an ongoing battle, at moment i don&#39;t think we&#39;re prepared at all - up till now conspiracy theorists <em>were</em> thought &#39;nuts&#39; funny how things change (can&#39;t hide the truth),</p>

<p>i too believe anything <em>is possible</em> &amp; that the good will overcome the bad </p>

<p>we have to accept the fact that if it&#39;s taken this long for us (finally) knowing we&#39;ve been used/abused &amp; lied to - we won&#39;t be able to <em>undo</em>  it all quickly, BUT, we&#39;ve taken &#39;the first step&#39; and it&#39;s a big one that is long overdue, i&#39;m patient but i&#39;m hoping the pace will step up, because it seems like everything is hitting the fan.</p>
