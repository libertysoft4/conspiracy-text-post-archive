<p>edit: <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2012/09/27/press-tv-tragedy-of-us-police-training-by-israeli-companies">The US then trains their police by Israeli methods and imports the latest/greatest oppression techniques to the US, which explains the rise in police brutality.</a> Unless something very unusual happens to stop it, we&#39;re going to see what&#39;s happening in Gaza happen in the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve got my own theory on this. </p>

<p>As everyone knows, The USA is a very religious nation. But a lot of American Christians aren&#39;t exactly sophisticated thinkers. As a result, they equate the modern day state of Israel with the Israel of the Old Testament. In their minds, Israel can do no wrong because the Bible says they&#39;re the good guys.... or something like that.</p>

<p>There are a lot of people with this perception. A lot of people who vote for the politicians that claim to uphold their views and share their values. The politicians eagerly pander to these voters because that helps them hang onto their jobs at election time.</p>

<p>The Israeli political leadership is well aware of this situation and they milk it for all it&#39;s worth. </p>

<p>If you want another example to compare this to, think about the influence of the Cuban community in Florida. It&#39;s not that many people. But they can help a presidential candidate win Florida at election time. So, a small group of people can exert a huge influence on US foreign policy. In this case, maintaining a ridiculous economic embargo for over 50 years.</p>

<p>Now keep this in mind as you consider the effect that tens of millions of conservative Christian voters can have when it comes to US policy towards Israel. It starts to make sense how this country can do whatever it wants, possess undeclared nukes, and get all manner of aid and military assistance at taxpayer expense.</p>

<p>No.  They think Israel&#39;s rise is prerequisite to the return of the Messiah.</p>

<p>Some think the third temple needs to be built before destruction will rain down on Israel.  Others think the Messiah will build the third temple; still others regard the Dome of the Rock as the third temple and think the Messiah will build the fourth.  This stuff goes on and on, but none of it is interested in Israel&#39;s well being but rather Israel as a tool.</p>

<p>Things get really strange when you move into various Pentecostal, Mormon, or other sects created by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFXFij2qgwc">British intelligence</a> and responsible for a lot of silly provocation in America.  Pat Robertson is the most famous example; his mother is Gladys Churchill (of Winston Churchill line), the House of Marlborough.  Interestingly, the House of Marlborough was Clinton&#39;s primary financial benefactor (via Pamela Harriman) while also controlling his most prominent &quot;opposition.&quot;  The House of Marlborough is the line of William of Orange, the foreign invader with Venetian backing that toppled the English throne (which is what provoked the American revolution in the first place), but now they own US presidents.  Top kek, murca.</p>

<p>Good point.</p>

<p>It&#39;s still the whole religious angle though. This is what keeps people from seeing that modern-day Israel is just another country.... instead of some sort of special case. This is the kind of thinking that helps create a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel is a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2c1gj5/the_western_elites_and_governments_are_not_merely/cjb1lq6">canard</a> that was established for several reasons.</p>

<p>In the above link, I reference Mazzini networks and widespread national subversion.  Albert Pike wrote a <a href="http://www.rense.com/general80/pike.htm">letter</a> to Mazzini where he said,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the &quot;agentur&quot; of the &quot;Illuminati&quot; between the political Zionists and the leaders of Islamic World. The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel) mutually destroy each other. Meanwhile the other nations, once more divided on this issue will be constrained to fight to the point of complete physical, moral, spiritual and economical exhaustionWe shall unleash the Nihilists and the atheists, and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil. Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction, anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out in the public view. This manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are many layers that you&#39;ll graduate through in comprehending why Israel was created.</p>

<ul>
<li>it was a simple deal made with Jewish bankers in return for financial support in WW1, re: Balfour accords</li>
<li>the British wanted a stronghold in the Middle East close to the Suez canal (see, Suez Canal crisis of 1956 - this was and remains a strategic economic choke point you want the ability to control)</li>
<li>the British wanted to foment Islamic radicalization in order to justify intervention / toppling regimes as it morphed from overt to covert control of the world (Brzezinski publicly advocates this in the past, comforted by the fact that no one read things before the internet; the ME states were also intentionally created with sectarian divides to make them unstable)</li>
<li>the British oligarchy is the manifestation of the masonic orders, who often use the Jewish canard as a shock absorber when the people revolt.  For example, freemasons were widely blamed for WW1 afterwards and Hitler&#39;s primary rhetoric rising to power was anti-masonic rather than anti-Jewish, but rapidly shifted upon seizing power; anticipation of a similar resurgence of anti-masonic sentiment needs a strengthening of the Jewish position to the point of being capable of absorbing another sufficient blow to distract the masses</li>
<li>the freemasons which control society want to engineer an &quot;end of days&quot; scenario that fulfills religious prophecy but with no savior showing up at the end of the play (or a controlled one that delivers a more severe mind fuck), thereby destroying their primary opposition in the world, Christianity and Islam.  They&#39;ve been quite successful in pitting the two against each other; encouragingly, this is fading but unfortunately it is being supplanted by anti-Jew rather than anti-masonic sentiment</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>According to some theories, back in the early 20th century, our economy tanked. Our country went bankrupt, amd needed help. Super wealthy bank owners formed a group amongst themselves to bail out the american government. This is also when the federal reserve was created, and it is posited that the owners of the fed were the ones who bailed our government out. </p>

<p>It follows that they struck a deal where if they were to bail out our government, they would be rewarded with the authority to print our money. And, as the saying goes, &quot;control the (flow of) money, you control the people.&quot;</p>

<p>At least, this is according to some theories...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the answer to this question lies in the ecceltic answers in this thread.</p>

<p>Having read down the list I found some detailed and confident answers, some joking answers, and some answers that were just stated as if fact and then repeated to reinforce the sentiment.</p>

<p>Is this not the root of the problem? A lack of clear unified understanding?</p>

<p>It would be interesting to poll the world and see just how many seperate and distinctly confident answers arise. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not that anyone really has anyone on anything at the end of the day. For my money, it is the lazy and incomplete pursuit of truth combined with the immature mind and moral weak individual that has caused this conflict and undoubtedly, every problem of a similar nature throughout all of history.</p>

<p>The problem is choice.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure politicians have the freedom to speak against Israel, but they will likely face a powerful opposition for doing so. Thus, the USA keeps good relations with Israel because of the deep roots that Jews have in the country.</p>

<p>I have found through both science and spirituality that often the simplest most obvious answer is the most true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s a combination of right answers in this thread.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is always a combination of answers when applying different perspectives to the same problem. This does not mean that the root nature of the problem itself is a result of combinatory variables but rather that all these complications stem from a root source.</p>

<p>I think that root source is choice. Not just of politicians and world leaders, but on an individual level and a massively global scale. </p>

<p>Here all of us are, chit chatting about it, doing our best to make sure everyone knows what we know, and I&#39;d like to believe that there are some of us working to manifest change. But there is an overwhelming sense of inaction for the most part.</p>

<p>I see revolutionary mindsets and informed fact based opinions and I see these sentiments confined to the mind. Perhaps it is just my mind that feels so paralyzed and not everyone elses, but no one has yet to show me a clear path of action that follows has justified means and justified ends and principles that I embody.</p>

<p>There are of course many many things that we can all do to help with many many things, but I see no focus. I see the same scattered dis-unity as I see on reddit.</p>

<p>After much historical, philosophical, personal/first hand, scientific, psychological and spiritual/religious reading, the only conclusion I can make that offers me a step towards world peace is the boycott of war and the complete dissociation with those individuals and groups that choose to participate in any way, shape or form.</p>

<p>This is of course terrifying because it then automatically relegates one to the victim role if we operate from a place of fear based behavior. If we are not prepared to fight then those that will, will most likely fight us. To steal from us, or because they dont like us, or for whatever reason.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter though is that this is the only clear path to world peace. Either we all decide to just stop it, to let go of the past and live in the present that promote a future of harmony, or those of us who non-violently oppose let go of this world and try to live as best we can, ultimately dying out under the weight of numbers.</p>

<p>Everyone has freedom, whether they feel it or are aware of it is another issue, but the power to choose act/live in a certain manner is 100% our own and impossible to take from us. therefore it must be deluded and muddled to the point where we do not trust ourselves and therefore do not trust those around us, and particularly those that are far away from us.</p>

<p>I maintain that the root problem is choice.</p>
