    <div class="md"><p>I believe that Hamas, or at the very least individuals of the region acting on their own accord, are indeed shooting rockets at Israel.  But I think the crux of the issue is this: these rockets, the few of them that are fired, are of poor design, rarely hit their mark, and almost always get blown up by the Iron Dome.  Israel in turn uses this as an excuse to launch <strong>full scale war</strong>, and retaliates by launching dozens of missile and artillery strikes back to where the rocket came from, killing not only the person who launched the rocket, but also the entire city block he was living in, men, women, and children, thusly creating MORE <em>&quot;terrorists&quot;</em> - or in other words, more people seeking revenge for the wrongful death of their loved ones against a terroristic apartheid state.  </p>

<p>If the same happened here at home and the Mexican Army killed my family because a terrorist was living down the street shooting rockets over the border, I&#39;d become a &#39;terrorist&#39; too, and I&#39;d do my best to seek revenge for their deaths against Mexico.  I&#39;m not sure why this is such a hard concept for a lot of Americans to grasp.</p>

<p>Because the media never focuses on why someone would potentially be willing to blow themselves up - it&#39;s only ever about the act. The first issue is too difficult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They weren&#39;t necessarily &quot;in control of them&quot;.  They funded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mujama_al-Islamiya">Mujama al Islamiya- a Muslim Brotherhood Organization</a>, as a divide and conquer strategy around the Fatah dominated PLO.</p>

<p>The reason for the current conflict is Hamas has been doing a pretty good job for the past year and a half at keeping terrorism down- which make Israel look bad.  And Hamas just signed a deal with Fatah for a unity government that would be recognized by the international community.</p>

<p>This whole thing is about delegitimizing Hamas and systematically destroying Gaza&#39;s civilian insfrastructure.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I think we can agree that all of these conspiracies can&#39;t all be true at the same time, but I think it is crazier to think  the world is like this by accident and that no one in power would even think of lying or cheating or covering things up to maintain power or get more money.</p>

<p>I honestly can&#39;t believe so many people don&#39;t believe in any conspiracies.</p>

<p>Someone (here? I can&#39;t remember) asked if there are any opinions that you have that you would be reluctant to share out loud in company, and if not, how did that happen?  You just all by yourself coincidentally arrived at the same conclusion as every other single person, or you have been programmed and conditioned from birth.</p>

<p>Along that line, here is the reasoning I go by, which is a corollary of &quot;follow the money&quot;.</p>

<p>Banks only make money when they loan money and the best way to loan money is to loan to countries and countries only need money to blow crap up and start wars.  Therefore, start as many wars as possible and loan to both sides and sell both of them weapons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m thinking the &quot;rockets&quot; are mostly propaganda. Most are nothing but sirens with Iron Dome lighting up the sky and making boom sounds while the Israelis huddle in their bunkers and curse their attackers. Some are fired by Mossad. A few fired by Hammas.</p>

<p>I think the real goal of Israel and Palestine is to research how to control and exploit population to maximum effect without causing a revolt -- physical/military control of the lower caste and mind-control of the upper caste to justify it. I&#39;m trying to extrapolate how this will play out within the US.</p>

<p>Our [New York Times] photo editor went through all of our pictures recently and out of many hundreds, she found 2 very distant poor quality images that were captioned Hamas fighters by our photographer on the ground. It is very difficult to identify Hamas because they don’t have uniforms or any visible insignia; our photographer hasn’t even seen anyone carrying a gun.</p>

<p>I would add that we would not withhold photos of Hamas militants. We eagerly pursue photographs from both sides of the conflict, but we are limited by what our photographers have access to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I think Israel Haters and Israel supporters buy too much into their news.</p>

<p>I think the world needs to be more concerned with how Hammas is getting these rockets because the sources I believe are foreign countries trying to influence and escalate the situation. Its a war that&#39;s being fought in Palestine but the players are much bigger and broader than the small region.  </p>

<p>Its hard for me to swallow all the civilians being killed in Palestine, but at the same time, tunnels are not defensive mechanisms and continually shooting rockets randomly into a country is horrifying even if the damage and loss of life is extremely minimal. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve read articles for over a decade how these terrorist groups operate in hospitals and schools to shield them from attack.  They really do this. The rules of engagement have changed once again, and the media is behind the times.</p>

<p>Oh they bombed a UN school, its Genocide! Oh but no one was killed, it doesn&#39;t matter 90 died that day. Oh but you see there&#39;s been 3 schools that were housing rockets. Oh.... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>there are a number of militant groups in gaza, and they are probably all firing rockets.  It&#39;s basically a protest.  When Israel does something particularly violent, they fire rockets into israel.  The purpose doesn&#39;t seem to be to kill or destroy, but to let the citizens of israel know that they are unhappy.</p>

<p>Clearly, if Hamas had been interested in killing civilians.  They&#39;d have been using these &quot;terror tunnels&quot; to target civilians before operation protective edge started.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe rockets are being fired but that they aren&#39;t really comparable and that Hamas had a hand being put where he is by the US/Israel so that Israel can justify genocide by saying they&#39;re targeting Hamas. </p>

<p>If all they really wanted was to kill Hamas then I see no reason why they couldn&#39;t send in highly organized and well armed ground troops to get them. They don&#39;t have to use bombs to accomplish their goals and in fact if Hamas are really as slippery as they make them seem it would likely be a much more effecient and PR friendly way to accomplish their goals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you may need to do a bit more research. Hamas is not a person, Hamas is a militant organization that was democratically elected to power in Palestine. They are said to be a terrorist organization by many countries (Canada, US, Japan, EU, UK, Egypt, etc.) but Iran, Russia, Turkey, and China don&#39;t view them as a threat.</p>

<p>The main issue that Palestine has is that they were forced to give up land after WWII and the Allied powers used the Palestinian land to give to the Jews (the survivors of the Holocaust had nowhere to go, and they were given their &quot;holy land&quot;). The Palestinians will not let go of the fact that their land was taken from them.</p>

<p>But then again, I do live in America. I wonder what the Native Americans would say.</p>

<p>I can see why you would think I was implying it was a person. I said him at some point instead of &quot;them&quot;...brains a little slow today. Tis Monday and I am at work. I have edited the post you saw for clarification. But I would think that identifying a militant in person and tracking them would be a lot easier then bombing a general populace trying to kill militants. Militants are armed I would think, so they&#39;d kinda stand out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rocket attacks do seem like a page right out of 1984, don&#39;t they?</p>

<p>It&#39;s also possible that Israel&#39;s leaders have simply engineered a situation that ensures there will be a continual terrorist threat. Intentional or not, that&#39;s the end result of their policies. It would be more surprising if there <em>weren&#39;t</em> violent militants in Gaza, considering the circumstances. The fact that they have chosen to attack in a way that seems to only benefit their enemy could be attributable to human error, or a lack of faith in the effectiveness of non-violent resistance. They want blood for blood, who doesn&#39;t? It&#39;s a hard cycle to break out of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I might have said something like &quot;We&#39;d love for the rockets to stop, but we can&#39;t control everyone.&quot; rather than, &quot;Meh, we want Israel to stop.&quot; 
My problem with supporting one side or another is all I have to do is go back a couple more years to be more upset at one, over the other. If I go back to day one of the handover, I can&#39;t go with the initial, and continual aggressor, whether or not they are losing, badly. Still, I don&#39;t like the way Israel is conducting some of their operations. I find it hard to pick a side, and be willing to stand on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel <em>is</em> better at it. You know why? They have the fourth strongest military in the world (backed mostly by American money). I don&#39;t know Hamas&#39; ranking but I&#39;m guessing it isn&#39;t anywhere near the top. </p>

<p>That makes it even more fucked up. A couple aluminum tubes filled with gunpowder get launched into Israel and they launch a full-scale war in retaliation. This beside the fact that Israel stole the fucking land to begin with. But don&#39;t forget, Israel is just defending itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you don&#39;t trust anything that is reported then why do you believe that Israel is even attacking Gaza?</p>

<p>Furthermore, if these attacks were staged, you&#39;d think that they would make them seem to be more effective in order to garner some kind of international support rather than fake the absolute disproportionate number of casualties we currently see which is causing international uproar.</p>

<p>But then again, that would require some common sense to think through, rather than just blindly coming up with ridiculous theories simply because they go against the existing narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a good point. If Israel/Mossad were secretly behind Hamas, and firing missiles at Israeli settlements, then the casualty rate would be higher to better justify invading Gaza. </p>

<p>Most news reports Palestinian deaths, and generally condemns Israel&#39;s actions. If most news is pro-Palestinian, then surely the conspiracy here is the Western World trying to reduce public support for Israel?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not justifying Israel killing civilians, but surely a conspiracy is when governments/organisations are convincing people of something to further their own cause? If so, then why is everyone reporting Israel as merciless killers of innocents?</p>

<p>I can see why you would think I was implying it was a person. I said him at some point instead of &quot;them&quot;...brains a little slow today. Tis Monday and I am at work. I have edited the post you saw for clarification. But I would think that identifying a militant in person and tracking them would be a lot easier then bombing a general populace trying to kill militants. Militants are armed I would think, so they&#39;d kinda stand out.</p>
