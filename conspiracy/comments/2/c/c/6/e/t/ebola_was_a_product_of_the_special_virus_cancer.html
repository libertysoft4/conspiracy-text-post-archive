<p><a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ebola-conspiracy-theories-spreading-fast-3929922">Ebola conspiracy theories spreading fast as outbreak travels round globe - was deadly virus created in laboratory?</a></p>

<p>A brilliant book was written on this subject nearly 2 decades ago called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Emerging-Viruses-Nature-Accident-Intentional/dp/0923550127">Emerging Viruses: AIDS and Ebola: Nature, Accident, or Intentional?</a></p>

<p><a href="http://blackherbals.com/Emerging_Viruses-Aids_&amp;_Ebola.pdf">Here&#39;s a pdf</a> of the first 100 or so pages (can anyone find the full text online?)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.whale.to/w/ebola.html">Here&#39;s an interview</a> with Leonard Horowitz, the book&#39;s author, back in 1995.</p>

<p>From the interview:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A secret cancer virus program was conducted between 1962 and 1974 by researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in co-operation with biological weapons developers for the dept of Defence, and in those documents it shows very clearly that what those researchers did was that they took things like the Simian monkey virus (SV40), and they essentially extracted the DNA out of it and they infused it with other types of nucleic acids like RNA from cat leukaemia, from chicken sarcoma, and that created a mutant, a new kind of germ, which still had a difficult time infecting humans. </p>

<p>They were not emerging from the wild, so today the Blacks have been blamed for AIDS. The gays have been blamed for AIDS. The monkeys have been blamed for AIDS &amp; Ebola, and you know what? That is a bunk, complete bull. </p>

<p>The truth of the matter is that the NCI researchers in co-operation with a narrow network of virologists who are being paid by the Dept of Defence to investigate these types of viruses, and the viral vaccines made from them. </p>

<p>Their biohazard and containment in their facilities were abysmal, and just like the recent Texas outbreak of Ebola, the other outbreaks---we have had monkey AIDS outbreaks over half a dozen times in the major vaccine production labs, as well as the research labs---the reason for this is because once you create these viruses they are very easily transmitted from one animal to the other in these facilities, and that as I see it is where viruses are emerging from.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.astrofreaks.net/2013/01/31/how-ebola-aids-cancer-were-created-in-the-cia-labs/">Do yourself a favor and watch this excellent lecture called The Exploding Autoimmune Epidemic</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The biggest thing is the history lesson, which starts with how we all as children were injected with a polio vaccine (or given orally) which was made with monkey kidney tissue, and we were basically injected with unknown numbers of “monkey viruses” many of which cause cancer.</p>

<p>This was the start of the “cancer epidemic” in the US. The whole thing was swept under the rug, and in trying to find a “cancer vaccine” they developed a cancer weapon, and other viruses as weapons… HIV etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For more extremely well-sourced information on this topic, I can&#39;t recommend this book enough:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Virus-Vaccine-Contaminated-Government/dp/0312342721">The Virus and the Vaccine: Contaminated Vaccine, Deadly Cancers, and Government Neglect</a></p>

The Birthplace of AIDS and the Kaposi&#39;s Sarcoma Epidemic</a></p>

<p>It seems that we fucked with nature, and now we are suffering the consequences.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a dentist, by the way. He has provided no conclusive evidence. The idea that he is the only person I should listen to on this subject is preposterous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q: Do you believe that the Ebola virus evolved in the wilds of Africa, and have you heard of the NW strain found in several monkeys imported into Texas?</p>

<p>A: Yes, indeed. They published studies, for example, John Landon who was director of Litton Bionetics had taken what was called Rabdo virus, or rabies type of viruses, called rabdo viruses simian...they had the contract for being the number one person to tell us what type of viruses these were. </p>

<p>As I said before they were recombining, they were mutating, there were different combinations so it was very difficult to understand which was which. Well he himself, we have published his statement to a conference, late 1960’s, shortly after the Marburg virus outbreak, the mother of Ebola, which broke out in 3 vaccine production facilities simultaneously in 1967, in Europe. </p>

<p>Shortly thereafter he gets up in a symposium and says &quot;I believe that this Simian Virus is man made&quot;. That is a quote, and so you have the worlds leading expert at the time who had the contract for the NCI to tell all other doctors what types of viruses they are, saying this, so it is not just me saying this. </p>

<p>But then, what happened was in the Special Cancer Virus Programme book, John Landon says that he took 18 Simian monkeys in about 1965/66 through 1970 this experiment ran, and he inoculated 18 Simian monkeys with rabdo virus simian which again all, most of the leading experts, the consensus was that the Marburg which was the mother of Ebola, that that originated from Rabdo virus Simian. </p>

<p>Here was a study, John Landon took 18 Simian monkeys, inoculated them with rabdo virus simian and then 9 of them died and 9 of them he said were transferred. Now everyone that has seen the movie outbreak knows that the monkeys that lived developed antibodies to the infection, and those were the monkeys that were very valuable to vaccine development and those were the monkeys that were shipped off to the vaccine development labs, so I actually cite in the book the most plausible study which gave rise to the first Marburg virus outbreak in 1967.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The idea that he is the only person I should listen to on this subject</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you bothered to check out the links (or read the books), you&#39;d find that he gets his information from <em>numerous</em> respected scientists and doctors.</p>

<p>Horowitz didn&#39;t come up with this theory, he just fleshed it out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He has been caught lying about the Acer AIDS claims.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source? I know he wrote his first major book on the subject, but that was in the early 90&#39;s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He claims H1N1 is designed to cause sterility, and SARS can be treat with homeopathy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What on earth does that have to do with this premise, which has an incredible amount of evidence to back it up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Horowitz is so full of shit it&#39;s not even funny.  He used to claim to be a doctor.  In fact he was a dentist.  Now he hawks &quot;healing crystals&quot; from his website.</p>

<p>A lot of the stuff he dug up was true and very disturbing but it was not possible for us to engineer viruses in the late 1960s when Ebola was first encountered in monkeys.</p>

<p>There have been numerous very scary diseases circulating in Africa since time immemorial.  Bats and monkeys harbor numerous very dangerous pathogens, most of which (the vast majority) we haven&#39;t encountered yet.</p>

<p>If you want three very well researched and credible books surrounding this subject, get Plague Warriors, Lab 257 and Operation Paperclip.</p>

<p>Horowitz has some interesting stuff but by being a pathological liar he cheapens his own message.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire premise is flawed here-- a bioweapons program in 1962-1974 wouldn&#39;t have the capability to develop transgenic viruses  from nucleic acids alone because a critical gene amplification technique (PCR) wasn&#39;t even invented until 1983. Furthermore, it&#39;s not possible to do that kind of sophisticated research before that time period because a separate critical component, reverse transcriptase, wasn&#39;t even discovered at all until 1970. Without knowledge of reverse transcriptase, it&#39;s not possible to understand why a virus like SIV is an interesting bioweapons candidate. </p>

<p>Also, the language used in the quoted piece is absolutely idiotic and shows that there&#39;s no understanding of the science at any point: &quot;they essentially extracted the DNA out of it and infused it with other types of nucleic acids like RNA from cat leukaemia, from chicken sarcoma, and that created a mutant, a new kind of germ,&quot; If you were to take some random SIV DNA and then try to add random RNA to it, you&#39;d get nothing. Biology doesn&#39;t accommodate for that kind of absurdity, and the understanding of the science wasn&#39;t progressed enough for fine control at the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if it&#39;s true, nothing is going to be proven enough to have any actions taken. Personally I believe our Government created quite a few bio-Weapons. Like Limes disease, it happened when we obtained Nazi scientists and offered immunity if they agreed to move to the US and continued their work. Except at that time they didn&#39;t have an unlimited black budget for fool-proof laboratories. From my understanding the usually just stuck them on an island, which obviously doesn&#39;t work considering Mosquitos, birds and people coming and going. It&#39;s very sad but no surprise to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should definitely check out this book:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lab-257-Disturbing-Governments-Laboratory/dp/006078184X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1406911789&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=room+257">Lab 257: The Disturbing Story of the Government&#39;s Secret Germ Laboratory</a></p>

<p>From amazon:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Strictly off limits to the public, Plum Island is home to virginal beaches, cliffs, forests, ponds...and the deadliest germs that have ever roamed the planet. </p>

<p>Lab 257 blows the lid off the stunning true nature and checkered history of Plum Island. </p>

<p>Based on declassified government documents, in-depth interviews, and access to Plum Island itself, this is an eye-opening, suspenseful account of a federal government germ laboratory gone terribly wrong. </p>

<p>Lab 257 takes you deep inside this secret world and presents startling revelations on virus outbreaks, biological meltdowns, infected workers, the periodic flushing of contaminated raw sewage into area waters, and the insidious connections between Plum Island, Lyme disease, and the deadly West Nile virus. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And a review:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reading an official press release from Plum Island is fairly benign. What&#39;s not easy is to read, however, is the litany of diseases handled incompetently there: Ebola, Marburg hemorrhagic fever, foot-and-mouth disease, Rift Valley fever virus, anthrax, plague, Entebbe, Zagazig 501, typhoid, diphtheria, E. coli, AIDS, polio, Japanese encephalitis, swine flu, mad cow disease, virulent influenza, Coxsackie B-5 virus, louping ill, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Newcastle disease, vesicular stomatitis virus, contagious ecthyma, Nairobi sheep disease, and anthrax. </p>

<p>Not all of these viruses have been contained. And that doesn&#39;t even take into account the various other test tube concoctions that cause encephalatic brain seizures, massive hemorrhaging, blindness, and death. Scary stuff, right?</p>

<p>Indeed, it&#39;s easy to make connections between Plum Island and three major disease outbreaks (West Nile virus - 1999, Lyme disease - 1975, Dutch duck plague - 1967). </p>

<p>When looking at a map that displays the number of Lyme disease cases in the US, the results are staggering. There is a heavier concentration of Lyme disease within a small radius of Plum Island than anywhere else in the U.S., which doesn&#39;t come as much of a surprise when considering they bred and infected deer ticks and Lone Star ticks by the thousands.</p>

<p>How exactly would anyone &quot;refute&quot; this material? The author just makes claims without providing any evidence. How do you refute opinion?</p>

<p>I can refute his claims that he has a skin cancer cure. He had to pull those claims when they were found false. I can refute his claims he can cure SARS. He makes a lot of claims associated with products he sells, but he has absolutely no evidence.</p>

<p>So how would one &quot;refute&quot; an unsubstantiated claim? That would be like me telling you the government killed all the unicorns because their blood cured cancer. Now refute my claim.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed you post things like this a lot. Just general stuff with no backing, then say &quot;prove it is wrong.&quot; It doesn&#39;t work like that. When you make incredible claims, you have to provide the evidence.</p>

<p>I&#39;d add that name calling someone who can&#39;t defend themselves is petty and childish. It&#39;s like you called out someone in a wheelchair, knowing they can&#39;t get up.</p>
