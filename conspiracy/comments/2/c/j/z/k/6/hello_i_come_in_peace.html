Honestly, you&#39;d be casting pearls before swine. It stinks like a set-up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a fellow host of the show, it&#39;s not a set up or anything of the sort. This is nothing but an attempt to get someone else&#39;s side of the story. We want to know why you believe what you do and what evidence you have to support your theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it would be much more important and relevant to sort out your own house and find out why your fellow sub-group members launch so much unwarranted vitriolic attacks at r/conspiracy. You see there&#39;s NOTHING for anyone here to gain by assisting you and the main essence of this is why you feel it so important? People are well-tired of the bait and switch game done by MSM propaganda houses, only to end up ridiculed, dismissed and attacked so why should anyone trust you? Maybe you&#39;d be taken more seriously if you weren&#39;t associated with them at all.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you do a show and interview the people who attack us at r/conspiratard and suss out what the source of their problem is? </p>

<p>Also, no one should trade precious dignity to go on a show from an insulting launch point called r/conspiratard! It&#39;s a bit like asking an Asian to accompany you to a Fu Manchu film festival and have them explain why they feel outraged. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also &#39;Pupup&#39; what you posted 6 days ago at conspiratard makes me call horseshit on your sincerity. Remember this crap? &quot;I think it would be kind of fun to have a podcast that discusses what conspiratards are saying and dissect their claims, kind of like what we do here. We could have the same people every week or we could change it up and have different members speak each episode.</p>

<p>Either way I think it would be cool to go over the things that r/conspiracy is freaking out over, possibly even having one of their members on the show. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watergate: Republican officials spied on the Democratic National Headquarters from the Watergate Hotel in 1972. While conspiracy theories suggested underhanded dealings were taking place, it wasn’t until 1974 that White House tape recordings linked President Nixon to the break-in and forced him to resign.</p>

<p>The Tuskegee Syphilis Study: The United States Public Health Service carried out this clinical study on 400 poor, African-American men with syphilis from 1932 to 1972. During the study the men were given false and sometimes dangerous treatments, and adequate treatment was intentionally withheld so the agency could learn more about the disease. While the study was initially supposed to last just six months, it continued for 40 years. Close to 200 of the men died from syphilis or related complications by the end of the study.</p>

<p>Operation Northwoods: In the early 1960s, American military leaders drafted plans to create public support for a war against Cuba, to oust Fidel Castro from power. The plans included committing acts of terrorism in U.S. cities, killing innocent people and U.S. soldiers, blowing up a U.S. ship, assassinating Cuban émigrés, sinking boats of Cuban refugees, and hijacking planes. The plans were all approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but were reportedly rejected by the civilian leadership, then kept secret for nearly 40 years.
| Author James Bamford, “A Pretext For War”, discusses the declassified “Operation Northwoods” documents revealing that in 1962 the CIA was planning to stage phony terrorist attacks on the US and blame it on Cuba to start a war: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IygchZRJVXM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IygchZRJVXM</a></p>

<p>1990 Testimony of Nayirah: A 15-year-old girl named “Nayirah” testified before the U.S. Congress that she had seen Iraqi soldiers pulling Kuwaiti babies from incubators, causing them to die. The testimony helped gain major public support for the 1991 Gulf War, but — despite protests that the dispute of this story was itself a conspiracy theory — it was later discovered that the testimony was false. The public relations firm Hill &amp; Knowlton, which was in the employ of Citizens for a Free Kuwait, had arranged the testimony.  It turned out that she had taken acting lessons on request of the CIA and was actually the niece of a major politician in Kuwait.  Nayirah was later disclosed to be Nayirah al-Sabah, daughter of Saud bin Nasir Al-Sabah, Kuwaiti ambassador to the USA.  The Congressional Human Rights Caucus, of which Congressman Tom Lantos was co-chairman, had been responsible for hosting Nurse Nayirah, and thereby popularizing her allegations. When the girl’s account was later challenged by independent human rights monitors, Lantos replied, “The notion that any of the witnesses brought to the caucus through the Kuwaiti Embassy would not be credible did not cross my mind… I have no basis for assuming that her story is not true, but the point goes beyond that. If one hypothesizes that the woman’s story is fictitious from A to Z, that in no way diminishes the avalanche of human rights violations.” Nevertheless, the senior Republican on the Human Rights Caucus, John Edward Porter, responded to the revelations “by saying that if he had known the girl was the ambassador’s daughter, he would not have allowed her to testify.”</p>

<p>Operation Mockingbird: Also in the 1950s to ’70s, the CIA paid a number of well-known domestic and foreign journalists (from big-name media outlets like Time, The Washington Post, The New York Times, CBS and others) to publish CIA propaganda. The CIA also reportedly funded at least one movie, the animated “Animal Farm,” by George Orwell. The Church Committee finally exposed the activities in 1975.</p>

<p>The Iran-Contra Affair: In 1985 and ’86, the White House authorized government officials to secretly trade weapons with the Israeli government in exchange for the release of U.S. hostages in Iran. The plot was uncovered by Congress in 1987.</p>

<p>Not that this is a bad thing but July 20, 1944 Conspiracy to Assassinate Hitler:  Among another 20 some odd attempts, this one was one of the largest conspiracies involving hundreds of loyalists in the highest echelons of Hitler’s inner circle.  Near the end of WWII, things were rapidly going south for Germany and the time seemed ripe for guilt-ridden Nazi officers to assassinate Hitler and overthrow his government. Colonel Henning von Tresckow recruited Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg to join the conspiracy in 1944.  The plot to take out Hitler and then all of his loyal officers was called Operation Valkyrie.  The plan was to use the Continuity of Government Proceedings during an assassination on Hitler’s life to take over full control of the government in Germany.  The assassination would be blamed on the Nazi SS and therefore allow Stauffenberg to take full control of all aspects of the government.  It almost worked.  In July 1944, Stauffenberg was promoted so that he could now start attending military strategy meetings with Hitler himself. On more than one occasion Stauffenberg planned to kill Hitler at such a meeting with a briefcase bomb, but he always held off because he also wanted to take out Hitler’s two right-hand men, Hermann Goering and Heinrich Himmler. On July 20, he went for it anyway and exploded a bomb inside Hitler’s conference room with a remote detonator. Hitler survived only minor injuries.</p>

<p>Operation Ajax: For years, Britain had a spiffy trade deal with Iran regarding their prodigious oil fields. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company was basically a giant money machine for the Anglo half, while the Iranian half got shafted. That all changed in 1951 when Iran nationalized the AIOC and the Iranian parliament elected Mohammed Mossadegh as Prime Minister. Mossadegh was relatively secular, something that pissed of Iranian clerics, but he was also very nationalistic.  He was a democratically elected, pro American figure but the West saw his nationalizing of the oil fields a communist move(something Mossadegh thought was the right of the people to profit and pay for services in the country with).  Those oil fields were under the control of British Petroleum, but unfortunately Mossadegh overruled this long standing business control.  The United States sent Kermit Roosevelt, FDR’s nephew and CIA coordinator in to figure out the mess.  The best he could come up with was to confront Mossadegh and have him overthrown and this was accomplished by bringing in what the agency refers to as “jackals.”  The United States backed the return of the Shah of Iran, one of the most brutal dictators the country had ever seen and intentionally overthrew years before with the democratic leader, Mossadegh.  Until 1979, that is, when a pissed off Iranian populace finally revolted and replaced the monarchy with an anti-West Islamic Republic.  The result was a violently anti-American revolution lead by the Ayatollah Khomeini which overthrew the Shah and took hostage US Embassy workers, many of whom were involved in the plot with Kermit Roosevelt that installed the Shah.  The planning for the Coup took place largely in that embassy, but Americans were told this was due to the rise of radical Islam and rise of democracy hating Muslims, which of course was far from the truth. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi-JiM0Ox_8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi-JiM0Ox_8</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mdeoktnv8ko">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mdeoktnv8ko</a></p>

<p>Operation Snow White:  Some time during the 1970s, the Church of Scientology decided that they’d had enough.  Apparently, the Church of Scientology managed to perform the largest infiltration of the United States government in history. Ever.  5,000 of Scientology’s crack commandos wiretapped and burglarized various agencies. They stole hundreds of documents, mainly from the IRS. No critic was spared, and in the end, 136 organizations, agencies and foreign embassies were infiltrated.</p>

<p>Operation Paperclip: Operation Paperclip was the code name for the 1945 Office of Strategic Services, Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency recruitment of German scientists from Nazi Germany to the U.S. after VE Day.  President Truman authorized Operation Paperclip in August 1945; however he expressly ordered that anyone found “to have been a member of the Nazi party and more than a nominal participant in its activities, or an active supporter of Nazi militarism” would be excluded.  These included Wernher von Braun, Arthur Rudolph and Hubertus Strughold, who were all officially on record as Nazis and listed as a “menace to the security of the Allied Forces.” All were cleared to work in the U.S. after having their backgrounds “bleached” by the military; false employment histories were provided, and their previous Nazi affiliations were expunged from the record. The paperclips that secured newly-minted background details to their personnel files gave the operation its name.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The New World Order:  This popular conspiracy theory claims that a small group of international elites controls and manipulates governments, industry and media organisations worldwide. The primary tool they use to dominate nations is the system of central banking. They are said to have funded and in some cases caused most of the major wars of the last 200 years, primarily through carrying out false flag attacks to manipulate populations into supporting them, and have a grip on the world economy, deliberately causing inflation and depressions at will. The people behind the New World Order are thought to be international bankers, in particular the owners of the private banks in the Federal Reserve System, Bank of England and other central banks, and members of the Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission and Bilderberg Group.  Now, although this conspiracy theory was ridiculed for years, it turns out that the Bilderberg does meet and requests no media coverage.  They receive no media coverage.  The world’s elite meet every year and it goes largely unreported, for what?</p>

<p>[efoods]Discussions at the meetings include the economy, world affairs, war and in general, world policy.  After the financial collapse, the Bilderberg played a key role in proposing that the world prepare for a new world order and have a standard world currency.  This was propsed shortly after by almost all attendees of the Bilderberg meeting.  During the 20th century, many statesmen, such as Woodrow Wilson and Winston Churchill, used the term “new world order” to refer to a new period of history evidencing a dramatic change in world political thought and the balance of power after World War I and World War II. They all saw these periods as opportunities to implement idealistic or liberal proposals for global governance only in the sense of new collective efforts to identify, understand, or address worldwide problems that go beyond the capacity of individual nation-states to solve. These proposals led to the creation of international organizations, such as the United Nations and N.A.T.O., and international regimes, such as the Bretton Woods system and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which were calculated both to maintain a balance of power as well as regularize cooperation between nations, in order to achieve a peaceful phase of capitalism.  In the aftermath of the two World Wars, progressives welcomed these new international organizations and regimes but argued they suffered from a democratic deficit and therefore were inadequate to not only prevent another global war but also foster global justice.  American banker David Rockefeller joined the Council on Foreign Relations as its youngest-ever director in 1949 and subsequently became chairman of the board from 1970 to 1985; today he serves as honorary chairman. In 2002, Rockefeller authored his autobiography Memoirs wherein, on page 405, he wrote:</p>

<p>“For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents … to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as ‘internationalists’ and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure – one world, if you will. If that’s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.”</p>

<p>Thus, activists around the globe formed a world federalist movement bent on creating a “real” new world order. A number of Fabian socialist intellectuals, such as British writer H. G. Wells in the 1940s, appropriated and redefined the term “new world order” as a synonym for the establishment of a full-fledged social democratic world government.  In the 1960s, a great deal of right-wing conspiracist attention, by groups like the John Birch Society and the Liberty Lobby, focused on the United Nations as the vehicle for creating the “One World Government”, and contributed to a conservative movement for United States withdrawal from the U.N.. American writer Mary M. Davison, in her 1966 booklet The Profound Revolution, traced the alleged New World Order conspiracy to the creation of the U.S. Federal Reserve System in 1913 by international bankers, who she claimed later formed the Council on Foreign Relations in 1921 as the shadow government. At the time the booklet was published, “international bankers” would have been interpreted by many readers as a reference to a postulated “international Jewish banking conspiracy” masterminded by the Rothschilds and Rockefellers.  American televangelist Pat Robertson with his 1991 best-selling book The New World Order became the most prominent Christian popularizer of conspiracy theories about recent American history as a theater in which Wall Street, the Federal Reserve System, Council on Foreign Relations, Bilderberg Group, and Trilateral Commission control the flow of events from behind the scenes, nudging us constantly and covertly in the direction of world government for the Antichrist.</p>

<p>After the turn of the century, specifically during the financial crisis of 2007–2009, many politicians and pundits, such as Gordon Brown, Henry Kissinger, and Barack Obama, used the term “new world order” in their advocacy for a Keynesian reform of the global financial system and their calls for a “New Bretton Woods”, which takes into account emerging markets such as China and India. These declarations had the unintended consequence of providing fresh fodder for New World Order conspiracism, and culminated in former Clinton administration adviser Dick Morris and conservative talk show host Sean Hannity arguing on one of his Fox News Channel programs that “conspiracy theorists were right”.  In 2009, American film directors Luke Meyer and Andrew Neel released New World Order, a critically-acclaimed documentary film which explores the world of conspiracy

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think much belief is necessary to analyze power structures, be a critical thinker and do research. Forming beliefs gets you none of the way, but a simple hypothesis and research will get you some of the way. Some things that interest me that I have done research on are the conflicts of interest in the FDA, the medical community and the foodsystem at large.  Also, I am very interested in the FOIA documents that have come out of the CIA dealing with Huxley, Wasson, Leary, Hubbard and the other MKULTRA subproject 58 folks.  I am very interested in the corporate media and what they do not report, who owns them, and why they are the way they are.  I also enjoy a nonpartisan critical political perspective. Propaganda is something I&#39;ve done a large bit of research on, and probably what I understand the most clearly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, <a href="/u/ghostmitten">/u/ghostmitten</a>.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve spoken some about the early Christians and their eye for power structures. Because of your mention of critical thinking, I&#39;m wondering if you&#39;ve ever explored critical theory?</p>

<p>Also, what kind of research have you done on propaganda? I&#39;m familiar only with, most overtly, Chomsky&#39;s (i.e. <em>Manufacturing Consent</em>).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have read about critical theory, mostly about Chomsky like you.  The most intense study of critical thinking  I&#39;ve done was learning and practicing &quot;the Trivium&quot; which is a systematic method of research/criticism.   </p>

<p>The research I&#39;ve done on propaganda has mostly been looking at it&#39;s examples and researching the history of how it&#39;s been used and how it works. It mostly works by subverting the rational processes and attempting to keep people in group thinking, emotional thinking and fallacious thinking.    </p>

<p>To me critical thinking is when someone makes a claim you haven&#39;t heard, you do research and think through it before you adopt it as truth.  It means that when you encounter new stuff, you think &quot;how is this bullshit?&quot;.  Not because everything is bullshit, but because you don&#39;t want to be fooled.  When you get down to it, any company that can condition you to want something irrelevant with propaganda, and get you to buy it is practicing mind control. The less controversial term would be manipulative lying.   </p>

<p>Most of us, I believe, subscribe to some theories. Some of us subscribe to none but still immerse ourselves in the discussions thereof. </p>

<p>Does it not occur to you that there have been real world conspiracies, documented and admitted, that we would be interested in?</p>

<p>MKUltra? Bay of Pigs? Even JFK had a plan come across his desk to stage attacks and blame it on Cuba/Communist sympathizers?</p>
