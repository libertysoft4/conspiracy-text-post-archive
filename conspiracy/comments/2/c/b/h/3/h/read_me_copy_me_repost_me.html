Every one of you that stand by our side have our deepest gratitude. This is a window into one of the most tragic events of our lives. We did not come to the decision to be as open about this quickly. The bottom line is that the only thing that matters to us is that the truth of what happened be brought to light so that we can do our best to prevent it from happening to someone else. After the email is a safe link where the entire text can be downloaded as a .pdf file. Please help us spread it. The power to affect real change lies in the voices of the many.</p>

<p>Hello, My name is Jeremy Sweat. I live with my wife Ginger and our two small children in Mason County, West Virginia. On June 24, 2014 the WV State Police Special Response Team shot and killed our dog. The WVSP were searching for a man named Jonathan Jeffers, who they allege shot at an officer while he responded to a domestic violence call. Mr. Jeffers fled from the police and ended up in the woods near our house. </p>

<p>We live in a very rural, and secluded area near Milton, WV. My wife Ginger was at home with our two small children, RaeLee and Avery. The morning of the 24th she noticed a local sheriffs vehicle in our driveway. She let me know, and I made the decision to call the sheriffs office as this was way out of the ordinary. They noted that I called, but didn&#39;t provide any information as to why they were on our property. Over the next two hours, the police presence increased, including a helicopter flying overhead. I called the sheriffs office again to make sure they knew that my wife and children were home. At that time they explained that they were actively searching for a fugitive, and they would alert the officers that my family was inside our home.</p>

<p>At approximately 1pm my wife put our oldest daughter down for her daily nap in the nursery. When she came out she noticed 6-8 men dressed as soldiers come out of the woods and into the gravel road in front of our home with a K9. Our dog Willy Pete, a six year old beagle/basset mix was asleep on his pillow right outside our front door, and directly beneath the window that Ginger was watching from. The K9 unit was barking when Ginger watched Willy Pete get up and leave the porch toward the officers. Ginger watched as one of the men raised his rifle towards Pete. She immediately ran outside to the top of the steps of our porch and began screaming for them to not shoot our dog as he would not hurt them. A shot was fired and Ginger saw a plume of dust come up from our yard between our dog and the officers. My dog being very afraid of guns (we live in an area with a lot of hunters) immediately turned around to run for Ginger, who was still desperately yelling for them to stop when they fired 3 more times. Willy Pete ran behind our house while Ginger ran through it to the back door. She saw Pete on the ground gasping for air and watched him die next to our air conditioning unit.</p>

<p>Moments later an officer came into our house. Ginger was literally in the floor sobbing begging to know why they had killed our dog. He responded &quot;Ma&#39;am we couldn&#39;t let our dogs fight. We are dog people too. Where is your shovel so we can bury him.&quot; Ginger told them I was on the way home and she wasn&#39;t going to do anything until I got there. I arrived approximately 15-20 minutes later to a veritable sea of police officers and vehicles. My wife was on our porch screaming and so upset I couldn&#39;t even understand what she was saying. I was screaming at them asking why they had killed my dog when I heard Ginger say they had shot towards her and the house (our younger daughter was in her chair in the living room by the window). I asked them why they would shoot at our house when the person I found out later to be the one who killed our dog grabbed my arm and cursed at me saying id better calm down before I got myself into trouble. Almost immediately they were asking me where my shovel was, and that they would do us the service of burying the dog. I told them I would help dig the hole, but I couldn&#39;t bear to look at my boy like that. Ginger and I gave statements to one of the officers and I began digging my dogs grave. The officers finished the hole and buried my dog. Before they left one of them came in and made an attempt at apologizing for what they had done. Ginger confronted him by asking why they shot towards her and our house. His demeanor instantly changed, and he left immediately. Several days later the WV State Police offered us a voucher from the Humane Society for a dog from a local shelter. We respectfully declined.</p>

<p>Being on a very limited income, saying that we couldn&#39;t afford an attorney to represent us would be an understatement. We decided to use the only tool that we felt we had available and made efforts to get our story on local news media and the internet. Almost immediately we received an outpouring of support. The WV State Police were obviously unprepared to handle the backlash and decided to make statements through their Facebook Page. These comments included the statement that reports of the dog being shot as it was running away were &quot;completely fictitious&quot;, and insinuated that we were inciting violence towards the police. All we did was ask for an investigation into the shooting. Based on these statements we decided to do the unthinkable and dig our dog up to have a necropsy performed. Several days later the WV State Police issued a lengthy press release as can been seen <a href="http://www.wchstv.com/newsroom/eyewitness/140630_26222.shtml">here</a>. This press release is almost entirely false as it pertains to the killing of our dog. They claim that Sgt. S.T. Harper shot Willy Pete three times within 3-5 feet as Pete continued to advance. However, we are in possession of a necropsy report which clearly shows our dog only has one entry wound and no exit. This means that by their own admission they must account for the other two bullets that are not in our dog.</p>

<p>The WV state police are absolutely responsible for where we stand today. Ginger and I are left with the heartbreaking loss of our loyal dog that we watched born into this world. Ginger will live the rest of her life with the horrific image of him running desperately to her for help. We have had our sense of security taken from us, and even worse my families lives were endangered when that officer made the terrible decision to shoot at my dog. Thankfully our children and my wife were spared. The damage they inflicted on us is not something that will soon be repaired. We will one day have to teach our children about what they do when they are in trouble, and we want to tell them like our parents told us, you pick up the phone and call 9-1-1. Unfortunately, I wont be able to teach them that without the specter of these events flashing through my mind.</p>

<p>Ginger and I have always been respectful of law enforcement, and refuse to give any credence to anyone who threatens violence against anyone brave enough to do their job. Ginger and I want our girls to be proud of the message that we leave behind. That message is that you stand up for what is right, even when it is against seemingly insurmountable odds. We have retained the counsel of Richard B. Rosenthal, General Counsel for The Lexus Project and Maxwell Hiltner of Mills, Mills, Fiely &amp; Lucas. We intend to pursue federal action against the WV state police seeking an injunction to require officers be trained on how to handle encounters with domesticated animals as well as establish a requirement for independent oversight of future incidents. Nothing can give us our sense of security or our precious family member back, but we can take solace in knowing that we did what was necessary to prevent this kind of horrific event from disrupting another families life. God forbid the next time something like this happens the consequences could be infinitely worse. </p>

<p>Since this happened to us last month we have become aware of just how often this happens in our country. The WV state police have only kept records for 4 years on dog shootings. Based on those records they have killed 15 dogs including Willy Pete. Sgt. S.T. Harper is responsible for three of them. This is one police agency in WV in 4 years. We shudder to think of the numbers once police agencies all across the country are considered. Our Facebook page receives information on a new incident almost every day. Please do whatever is within your capacity to help us spread our story. We are sending this email to any and everybody that we can think of. If you have invested the time to read this far I beg of you to please support our cause by sharing our Facebook page. Please do not hesitate to contact us directly at [<a href="mailto:Justiceforwillypete@gmail.com">Justiceforwillypete@gmail.com</a>](<a href="mailto:justiceforwillypete@gmail.com">justiceforwillypete@gmail.com</a>), or respond directly to this email. You can reach Richard Rosenthal at [<a href="mailto:Richard@thedoglawyer.com">Richard@thedoglawyer.com</a>](<a href="mailto:richard@thedoglawyer.com">richard@thedoglawyer.com</a>) and Max at [<a href="mailto:Mhiltner@mmfllaw.com">Mhiltner@mmfllaw.com</a>](<a href="mailto:mhiltner@mmfllaw.com">mhiltner@mmfllaw.com</a>).</p>

<p>Again we beg of you to assist us in any way possible.</p>

<p>Thank you, </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am sobbing with grief and rage for your family has had to endure during this irreparable tragedy. I am so sorry for the loss of your furry family member. 
I can&#39;t imagine what it must been like for your wife to have seen that. Oh wait, I can. It&#39;s called empathy and unfortunately, we don&#39;t see much of it as of late. </p>

<p>&quot;Empathy is the ability to mutuallyexperience the thoughts, emotions, and direct experience of others. It goes beyond sympathy, which is a feeling of care and understanding for the suffering of others. Both words have similar usage but differ in their emotional meaning.&quot;</p>

<p>Here is how I practice genuine empathy. As uncomfortable and painful as it can be, I literally visualize myself in the the other persons shoes. I visualized my little chihuahua running towards me for help and being shot down. I actually felt the pain and despair that would follow seeing that. I have had friends and relatives suggest I am an empath. This makes sense as I have always mirrored the moods and/or feelings of others around me. I&#39;ve actually felt physically drained after being in the presence of someone who is especially negative or histrionic. So being genuinely empathetic comes naturally to me. 
Anywho, this isn&#39;t about me so I&#39;ll get to the point. IMHO practicing empathy on an individual level can drive non-violent revolution as a collective. The individual is empowered by the empathy and compassion in the support system. The indifference of our current societal structure will be the death of us if we don&#39;t make changes as an individual. Being aware of the truth of what&#39;s going on in our respective countries and the world as a whole are essential. But we can incite action to back up the discontent if we sprinkle it with a little empathy.
Again, this is just my opinion for what it&#39;s worth. </p>

<p>You go in china, the police are really nice peoples, they help you, if they are behind you in car, you dont have this bad feeling in the stomach, here in america, every time a cop is behind you in car, you have this odd feeling in the stomach and you know you in trouble. In america we are all suspects and even when we arent, we still are because they rigged the law. And unless the people stand up as a whole (which wont happen any time soon bc they make sure we are all divided) and face the gov. the new laws they made, the militarization of the police force and all. nothing will change.
