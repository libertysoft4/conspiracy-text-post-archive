        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think there&#39;s a lot of FUD going around on both sides, multiple conspiracies to galvanize hatred and polarize opinions. Both Hamas and Israel both agree that Hamas fired first, targeted civilians, and kept firing after Israel warned them several times. Why is it Israel&#39;s fault in the eyes of many? I have not seen a logical argument. Israel has been established since before I was alive and most of it&#39;s people were born in to Israel. Most attempts to bring peace and a fair compromise have been thwarted by Muslim leaders.</p>

<p>It may seem like I&#39;m Israel sided, but if there is a logical reason I&#39;d really like to know. I am willing to change my mind on any subject given new evidence.</p>

<p>Right now it just seems like a lot of hate speech is coming from the pro-hamas and Hamas themselves calling for the death of all Jews, justifying horrible crimes, etc. How can I take them seriously while they are being so hateful and racist?</p>

<p><em>UPDATE</em> 
1)It was thought that Israel fired first with an airstrike that killed 2 teenagers in gaza response to the murders of some Israelis during the talks on peace/blockades. 
Hamas claimed responsibility for those Israeli deaths and mocked the victims and their families, so technically Hamas fired first. 
2)We also found out that Israel, near the end of the talks, found a active tunneling operation that was creating tunnels for the purpose of attacking Israel in civilian areas. It was confirmed as a 100% a Hamas operation. 
3)When asked to use non-western non-jew-owned media to prove Hamas fired rockets we did and found video of them setting up rockets next to apartments, schools, community centers, and hotels. We found Hamas officials issuing ultimatums claiming responsibility for the attacks. We found many bodies of casualties around rocket sites had marks on their wrists and ankles, signs that they were bound there. There are photos of people with mental illness or developmental disorders being chained near rocket sites.</p>

<p>After investigation it looks like the rocket sites are generally unmanned so people in the surrounding area that see these tents go up should report the launch site before it launches in order to prevent an airstrike. In several cases Israel has given good warning to people but not in all cases. Seeing rockets being set up should be their warning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the death numbers are related to firing back on missile sites. Seems pretty much like defense and not offense to me. Hamas is launching missiles from populated areas, therefore Hamas is selecting the targets for Israel. Ya the numbers suck but didn&#39;t Israel get launched on for a very long time before they retaliated? I seem to remember day after day during Hamas launching into Israel and Israel asking them to stop and warning them. Offering them deals.</p>

<p>Is Israel forever supposed to hide in shelters and never come out because firing back might hurt the civilians that support the enemy?</p>

<p>Maybe the civilians of Gaza should take up arms against Hamas. Drive them out.</p>

<p><em>edit</em> BBC and Al Jazeera are reporting that between 500 and 700 of the &quot;civilians&quot; killed were actually non-uniformed members of Hamas(~580), or Jihadists(approx 110) making them a non-civilian casualty.
The UN is reporting 1400 people total were killed. ~900 civilians is still way too high for my tastes but since I&#39;m not a military commander I&#39;m not sure what could be done to prevent it without spending tens of dozens of lives in a ground campaign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They make shit up, and when they get caught in a lie they ask you to do hours of research and give them 1000 sources from Muslim media then change the topic to &quot;but did you see their conditions and reasons why they would be launching rockets&quot;</p>

<p>We went through and only found videos of Hamas, not Jews, setting up rockets under tents and transporting weapons and non-uninformed soldiers in ambulances. We all saw Hamas live on tv and on record claiming the rockets won&#39;t stop unless &lt;insert ultimatum here&gt;. Sure seems like Hamas is claiming responsibility and if they can seek an ultimatum they seem to think they have control over weather the rockets will launch or not.</p>

<p>We indulged them and found media that was not western controlled and got international sources from Russia, UK, Turkey, Iran, India, Pakistan, and Palestine itself all claiming that Hamas launched the rockets.</p>

<p>The problem with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is people try to believe what they want to believe way too much, instead of looking at facts, logic, and reason. </p>

<p>I&#39;m asked for sources over and over to prove a point that everyone knows as truth and 90+ percent of the world agrees on while they have no proof but faked photos, photos that don&#39;t prove anything, accusations that Jews blew up the twin towers and other laughable claims...</p>

<p>Now there&#39;s claims that &quot;oh ya it was Hamas but Hamas was created by the Jews to attack themselves&quot; This shit is getting stretched quite thin. I&#39;m not talking about just this sub thread either there are a few in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and a few all over the rest of reddit.</p>

<p>In the end they probably know they are wrong and maybe they were paid by Hamas to spread FUD and gain young minds support around the world. Or maybe they are just epic trolls or mentally ill. But no matter what they can not be taken seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After reading several Muslim owned news agencies here is what I get for a time line of events.</p>

<p>Israel blamed Hamas for the June 12 kidnapping of three teenage settlers in the occupied West Bank. These killings broke up the talks on the blockade and restrictions.</p>

<p>Bodies were found on July 1, Hamas was suspected of the murders.
Hamas mocks the dead and their families.</p>

<p>An Israeli Air Strike on a Hamas target also killed two innocent civilian teenagers.</p>

<p>Hamas vows revenge and launches a series of attacks including rockets.</p>

<p>I got this out of gulfnews (UAE), Russian owned news organizations, UK owned news organizations, UN releases and comments, Fars News Agency (Iran) they all said that said Hamas fired tons of rockets but in response to Israel&#39;s single airstrike. I could not find one instance where they denied Hamas fired tons of rockets. A lot of places never mentioned that any rockets were fired, and only displayed the death toll and pointed comments but the lack of a denial is evident. </p>

<p>So there may have been a unjust and overkill first strike by Israel, I&#39;d have to research it more to figure it out. This still doesn&#39;t excuse Hamas when many of their rockets are falling short and hitting people in Gaza. It still doesn&#39;t excuse Hamas for targeting civilians in general and calling for genocide. It just looks like I finally am starting to understand the WHY of these events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>United Nations Relief and Works Agency had a few words to say about who fired the rockets. &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter if Hamas fired the rockets first or if Hamas asked Jihadists to fire the rockets. Hamas was behind the firing of rockets and is now continuing the rocket attack.&quot; The UN documents go on to say that after several rocket attacks a airstrike on a home that killed 2 teenagers caused Hamas to declare all Israeli citizens a target and called for a genocide against the Jewish people.</p>

<p>The UN had some words about how Hamas presents itself as well. Hamas has stated that it would not identify it&#39;s spokespersons and they appear masked even when making official announcements. This is not how a people wanting statehood should act. They should be professional, not shady as hell.</p>

<p>A letter from Hamas addressed to to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated that they had attacked Israel in response to the breakdown in communication regarding the blockades. Now Here I can see a bit of reason why they are mad. I would be mad too. A lot of these people have family and business on both sides. These blockades are not unique to Israel, though, Egypt and other surrounding entities also blockade them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s well known that Hamas has reached out to Hezbollah, petitioning the Lebanese-based terror group to help fight Israel and kill Jewish people inside and outside of Israel. If Hamas has not been fighting Israel then why would it claim it has been waging war on Israel and needs help fighting Israel.</p>

<p>Found this surfing Al Jazeera and gulftoday.ae and BBC. Same story with all these topics with all 3 news agencies.</p>

<p>I can find tons of videos like this, hundreds, of people Identified as Hamas from sources out of Russia, India, Palestine, Gaza itself. I also watched the Hamas ultimatum over the weekend where Hamas took credit for the attacks on live tv. You still have not had one source posted, nor can I find one source from gaza, palestine, or surrounding Arab countries that dispute these events.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried, I looked. Maybe it&#39;s just not reported in English I said, so I had shit translated.</p>

<p>According to Hamas&#39;s own websites/accounts it seems like they kicked a bee hive and expected bees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The difference in quality of munitions is a factor. Hamas has glorified fireworks compared to the top of the line munitions we give Israel. This is why the casualties are so lopsided. </p>

<p>Just wanna say that I don&#39;t support Hamas, obviously. I support those non combatants caught living in the ghetto known as Gaza, who get the best weapons made in the world dropped on them. Those are children. And when Israel kills scores of children seeking shelter, the perpetuate they next generation of Hamas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a good point, if someone is conducting war with primitive equipment they still are conducting war. Intent is intent. I just happen to be wondering how many of those non combatants support Hamas and was anything done to help them flea the area as the conflict escalated?</p>

<p>This is one thing we should have documented. Where was the UN and what did they do to protect these people. Did Israel do it&#39;s best to warn them?</p>

<p>I can&#39;t really find much sauce other than reporters saying that they were warned and that UN resources were seized by Hamas.</p>

<p>They warn them by dropping leaflets, but it&#39;s not like they can go anywhere when hospitals, schools, and other traditional shelters are potential targets</p>

<p>If anything, Stephen Harper (Canadian Prime Minister) went of record saying we are their biggest friend. Our official government position is that the settlements are illegal and an obstacle to peace. </p>

<p>What disappoints me about the &quot;dialogue&quot; is that criticizing Israeli &quot;foreign&quot; policy is not choosing sides.  There are better ways this situation could of been solved. </p>

<p>Also, pointing to the shamefully high civilian death toll doesn&#39;t automatically make one pro-hamas. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Both Hamas and Israel both agree that Hamas fired first, targeted civilians,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No they don&#39;t. It&#39;s now believed that Israel fired first - but what does it matter? Pointing fingers as an excuse for committing atrocities is wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is it Israel&#39;s fault in the eyes of many? I have not seen a logical argument</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only people playing the blame game are the ones firing the rockets on both sides. The innocent victims are being hit by bombs and rockets from both sides and they just wish everyone would stop fighting. Hamas isn&#39;t fighting on their behalf. It is fighting for existence of Palestine, and they don&#39;t care how many Palestinians get sacrificed in their quest. And Israel is happy to oblige. The reason people outside Israel are getting upset is because we see the gross imbalance of firepower being used. Hamas is being suicidally provocative with its attacks on Israel. They are totally ineffectual and have only killed three civilians so far despite thousands of rockets being launched towards Israel. The Palestinians themselves are more likely to be hit by &#39;friendly fire&#39; than the intended targets. That&#39;s because the weapons Hamas has are little more than fireworks. The weapons which Israel retaliates with, on the other hand, are precision guided mission specific munitions which are designed to kill civilians -such as flechettes - which are illegal under international law, but used by Israel anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the Israeli&#39;s kill more Palestinians in one morning than all the Israeli&#39;s killed in rocket launches in the past 15 years. Yes, a rocket launch is a threat, but the death numbers are so far out of proportion to the actual threat of the rockets, considering Israel&#39;s defenses (Iron Dome, etc.). If one considers the obvious ethnic chauvinism of Israeli Jews/Zionists, one sees that they can justify anything - murder, slaughter, lies and extortion.  </p>
