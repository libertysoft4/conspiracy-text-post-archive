<p>Anyone just kind of take it all in and think, maybe not in 10 years, maybe not in 20, but sooner or later this shit is going to stop. Humanity always finds a way to find the breaking point, and when those flash points arrive there is <em>always</em> a whole lot of violence, social upheaval. There will be a changing of the guard folks, and I&#39;m actually optimistic that it will be sooner then later.</p>

<p>By the way, I went ahead and backed up my claims with sources in case any nay sayers wander into this thread spouting bullshit and lies. Feel free to click on any single claim I make and be routed to a &#39;respectful&#39; source of journalism which word for word backs me up.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guerrilla warfare is powerful, it&#39;s worked against the United States before in Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan etc. I&#39;m not so sure the American military would be so easy to coerce into fighting the people anyways. Likely we would see a kind of military take over of the country like what happened in Egypt, where the military doesn&#39;t fight the people, or fight the government, but rather just sit back and protect the people from paid mercenaries or brutal police. I still have tremendous faith in our military and its leaders, they simply do what they are told, but they too have a breaking point. </p>

Stories of true <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pis3veqKl8k">courage</a> are always the best ones. It appears to be the set and setting of our story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People like to ridicule the Boomers and sometimes deservedly so, but the anti-Vietnam war movement of the sixties was the last time the people of America seriously threatened the powers that be. Student activists were a major part of that. Where is today&#39;s Mario Savio? Savio was a classics major who could express powerful thoughts in an articulate way. Today he would probably be studying for an MBA or a professional degree and be saddled with so much debt that an arrest record for civil disobedience would destroy his life. People on this subreddit would do well to study what happened back in the sixties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but the 60&#39;s didn&#39;t just come from nowhere. It took a while for the roots to develop and there were plenty of chest pains and signs of turbulence before a real cultural revolution broke out. OWS shouldn&#39;t be looked at as a failure, it should be looked at as a giant stirring from a long slumber. The anger, energy, and passion is all still boiling underneath the surface and it will surface again.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 27 years old, trust me, something is happening in our country. My brother went to UC Davis, he was there when they pepper sprayed all those kids. He said the night of that incident, 2000 students stood outside the Dean&#39;s office in the parking lot holding candles. They formed a column and were completely dead silent, all staring directly at her, as she walked to her car with a look of utter awe. Those kinds of things don&#39;t make it too the major media outlets, but they are happening. Also, don&#39;t think that we are just glued to our cell phones, or are distracted by other things. You never know when that kid looking at his cellphone is reading Noam Chomsky. The internet has given our generation an extremely valuable resource to protest and learn of injustice in a way the 60&#39;s could never imagine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw that vigil at UC Davis. It was inspiring. I slept at Zuccotti Park and had to walk past a gauntlet of 100 NYPD revving the engines of their fucking bikes as I went past them. Goons. That was the first time in my adult life that I really woke up to just how much of a police state the US has become which would have been heartbreaking but the people at OWS were like this collection of the best this country has to offer. I left there knowing that the Goons will win battle after battle, but they can&#39;t stop real Americans even if those Americans don&#39;t get on TV or in newspapers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly do not think we will ever see a revolution unless living conditions become unbearable for the majority of Americans. The problem is that a revolution needs a leader and with today&#39;s tech, a leader can be quickly neutralized. If you do not think a revolution needs a leader, look how easily the Occupy movement was subverted. They started out with a coherent message and a goal, which quickly became multiple messages and multiple goals, until finally nobody knew what the hell they were doing there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main issue is that for a &quot;revolution&quot; to be truly &quot;revolutionary&quot; the underlying idealogy must be more powerful than the original leaders of it.</p>

<p>Look at Communism, for as bad as it is it was able to spread because the proles rightfully hated their shitty masters. They didn&#39;t need Lenin or Trotsky to lead them, because at the end of it they were all willing to walk into their elites&#39; mansions and shoot them. Same for the early US, joe blow dirt farmer was pissed off that he had to pay for the French-Indian war through a tax on a common drink when Westminister had told them otherwise before. Today there is no real idealogy that can unite people, other than a common distrust of authority. This can manifest as anarchism but the problem is that the average person is unwilling to devote time to their civic duties, especially local ones. We live in a country where someone will buy up from one tract house to another hundreds of miles away. Until people commit to an area, either through volunteering to (as they should) or by force (specifically poverty) they won&#39;t be intersted in keeping local politcans accountable. And if you can&#39;t keep your Mayor or Sheriff to behave, your Assemblyman or Senator sure isn&#39;t either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It also needs a defined goal as well.</p>

<p>I think the occupy movement was made to discredit protestors and anti-government speech.</p>

<p>1.) It had no leader</p>

<p>2.) It had no defined goals besides &quot;corporations are bad, do stuff&quot;</p>

<p>3.) It had almost no planning or serious operation; people in tents will just make the whole movement look stupid.</p>

<p>Anonymous is the same thing; anyone can claim that &quot;Anonymous did that!&quot; because by nature you don&#39;t know who they are... a government agency could do something, and then blame anonymous and nobody would know any better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that a revolution can occur unless there is a person or group of people with the will and courage to openly challenge the corporate state. They would need clear and achievable objectives like audit the Fed or absolve all student loan debt. More importantly, they would need their message to be spread by a national media outlet or to go viral on the internet.</p>

<p>Russell Brand has openly advocated for revolution, but he’s treated like a fool by the mainstream media. No one is perfect, and any person or group of people who rise to public awareness will face similar threats or worse.</p>

<p>That’s why most people who do take action work silently and anonymously to subvert the corporate state. Their efforts are of a different kind, but these people do exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I have to admit that has been my own personal solution to the stress of being aware of what is actually going on in the world, in a way.  I have turned more towards the arts for expression since I cannot talk to anyone in my circle about this.  They are totally bought in.  I love them too much to alienate myself for a &quot;cause&quot;.  So, art and self-expression is a solution.  I have also left the corporate world to work for myself and thereby have more control over the ethics of what I do for a living.  You&#39;re right.  I do apologize.  Little steps add up to a march.  Peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This shit will stop when people get pushed around enough in a small enough amount of time. When you boil a frog, you turn up the heat slowly so it doesn&#39;t notice.</p>

<p>In other words, people only care about what the government does when it has a sudden and direct impact on their lives. Wonder why nobody cared about gun control until the mid 90s? Because before then nobody ever thought that the feds would actually start banning certain firearms. Now in 2015 California has effectively shadowbanned handguns for the next few years while the handgun roster goes into the 9th circut.</p>

<p>Same with privacy and the govenment in general, people will take a stand when they feel threatened. As gens XYZ age and have every single forum post, facebook like, and tweet come back to haunt them in middle age the demand for privacy will grow. </p>

<p>But as for actual conflict, it&#39;s situational. Europe has screwed itself over by importing Muslims that will only multiply and radicalize in the coming decades, China is entering a depression right now as is Russia. Here in the states we have a huge student loan crisis which will drag the economy down long after we&#39;re dead. In California you have a seccessionist movement (Jefferson) growing traction, though it&#39;s against the state government and not against the feds. The biggest source of conflict in all of this is cosmopolitan areas vs rural areas, especially with cities that have huge amounts of poverty/wealth inequality and have to turn to draconian measures just to keep the lid on. Meanwhile rural areas will be dragged behind them until people there make an organized stand. This is when things will come apart.</p>

There are so many things that <em>could</em> happen within most of our lifetimes that would really shake things up. I mean there&#39;s AI, Quantum Computing, 3D Printing, Cryptocurrency, Virtual Reality, Nanotechnology, Robotics,  and a great deepening of knowledge of the Cosmos, just to name a few. Sometime soon, there will have to be a huge breakthrough in one, or all of these magicks.

<p>I think the occupy movement was made to discredit protestors and anti-government speech.</p>

<p>1.) It had no leader</p>

<p>2.) It had no defined goals besides &quot;corporations are bad, do stuff&quot;</p>

<p>3.) It had almost no planning or serious operation; people in tents will just make the whole movement look stupid.</p>

<p>Anonymous is the same thing; anyone can claim that &quot;Anonymous did that!&quot; because by nature you don&#39;t know who they are... a government agency could do something, and then blame anonymous and nobody would know any better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main issue is that for a &quot;revolution&quot; to be truly &quot;revolutionary&quot; the underlying idealogy must be more powerful than the original leaders of it.</p>

<p>Look at Communism, for as bad as it is it was able to spread because the proles rightfully hated their shitty masters. They didn&#39;t need Lenin or Trotsky to lead them, because at the end of it they were all willing to walk into their elites&#39; mansions and shoot them. Same for the early US, joe blow dirt farmer was pissed off that he had to pay for the French-Indian war through a tax on a common drink when Westminister had told them otherwise before. Today there is no real idealogy that can unite people, other than a common distrust of authority. This can manifest as anarchism but the problem is that the average person is unwilling to devote time to their civic duties, especially local ones. We live in a country where someone will buy up from one tract house to another hundreds of miles away. Until people commit to an area, either through volunteering to (as they should) or by force (specifically poverty) they won&#39;t be intersted in keeping local politcans accountable. And if you can&#39;t keep your Mayor or Sheriff to behave, your Assemblyman or Senator sure isn&#39;t either.</p>
