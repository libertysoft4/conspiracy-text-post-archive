    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, but on a &quot;balance of probabilities&quot; scale, I would say it this particular hit was unlikely to have been ordered by Putin. </p>

<p>We know Putin has no qualms about eliminating those he deems &quot;traitors&quot;, be they journalists whose investigations threaten him (Politkovskaya) or FSB agents who defect to MI6 (Litvinenko). But this clumsy, very public mafia-style hit on a political opponent is too blatant, too obviously going to be blamed on him (by the Western media). For me this is another MH17 scenario - a crime committed by western intelligence agencies to be pinned on Putin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure the Litvinenko hit was very clumsy, very public. If it was Putin, then it can be assumed he would do the same with Nemstov, since he&#39;s already shown he doesn&#39;t care about being covert. And since Nemstov is in his home turf, it could very well be that if Putin ordered it, he didn&#39;t care about how obvious it was.</p>

<p>I know that agencies like CIA and Mossad have done a lot of dark things in the past, but considering events right now, I just don&#39;t see any reason that they would take out Nemstov. </p>

<p>Also, consider this. It&#39;s Putin&#39;s home turf, where he controls the media. He doesn&#39;t care what the rest of the world thinks of him and Russia, as long as they&#39;re scared. This means he could just spin the assassination whatever way he wanted at home, putting the blame elsewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>the Litvinenko hit was very clumsy, very public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dropping polonium into the target&#39;s tea in a swanky hotel might have been in plain sight, but it wasn&#39;t clumsy. It took some inspired detective work to determine that this was what happened. I don&#39;t think there are any previously recorded assassinations using polonium, so the FSB agents, Lugovoy and Kovtun reasonably assumed that their modus operandi would not be discovered.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a judgment call. If you know that the CIA and Mossad are inordinately fond of false flag type interventions in which innocents get murdered, then they are the joint prime suspects. Other intelligence agencies (French DGSE, Mi6/SIS) tend to have stricter internal guidelines - but still possibles. Putin/FSB are obviously on the suspects list, because they have previous, and can&#39;t be ruled out, but I still think it very unlikely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah because the country under his leadership doesn&#39;t have numerous examples of the same thing happening to other dissenters.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mindset that Putin can do no wrong. It is a <em>seriously messed up</em> political system and this doesn&#39;t excuse the &quot;West.&quot; This might not be Putin, but randomly calling it some Western attack to make Putin look bad is just as presumptuous as saying it was Putin. Nemstov recently was terrified he was going to be murdered. Was he a part of the conspiracy too? </p>

<p>It is unlikely that there will be a transparent, impartial investigation. There hasn&#39;t been any precedent in similar affairs in Russia in the past. There has been precedent for extrajudicial and judicial crackdowns on dissenters of the status quo that Putin and his associates. </p>

<p>As I said before, there is a significant precedent for this kind of thing happening with ties to the Kremlin. Yes, it is in the Wests interest, but that is not in itself evidence of their complicity. Unfortunately innocent until proven guilty isn&#39;t a reality. People are naturally going to suspect the organization is part of a corrupted oligarchy in the country and with the past precedent to do so. </p>

<p>The one way that they could vindicate themselves in the eyes of their critics would be to have an independent and transparent investigation into the incident. It is unlikely this will happen and even more unlikely that a positive suspect would be identified. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Underestimating the Russian mindset as usual.</p>

<p>You think ahead, you know this guy will become a thorn in your side and you know that at some point you&#39;re going to have to remove him.
So you say &quot;at some point in the near future there will be a false flag of this nature perpetrated against me.&quot; Which Putin is on record as saying two years ago.</p>

<p>Then  when you need to you whack the guy, right on your doorstep.
Naturally everyone goes apeshit pointing the finger right at you, this is expected. Then you merely wait until cooler heads (such as those in this thread) start to say &quot;well surely he wouldn&#39;t be stupid enough to whack the guy on his own doorstep, knowing full well everyone will blame him... besides he said two years ago a false flag of this nature would be perpetrated against him, I don&#39;t buy that he did it, but of course the west is jumping on this opportunity to blame him, it is just too convenient to be credible...&quot;</p>

<p>You are saying he wouldn&#39;t be stupid enough to do it on his own doorstep... I say he is SMART enough to do exactly that.</p>

<p>...and that my friends is proper conspiracy math.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Either way we will never know the real truth.. We all know Obama is fudging numbers who is to say Putin is not fudging his approval rating numbers? Remember everyone has a price or something that can be used to blackmail them. But that is just playing devil&#39;s advocate.  </p>

<p>I dont believe Putin would risk everything he has done in the last years by putting a hit out on this man.. I believe it was something else entirely. (what that other issue is that cause him to be gunned down no idea though) Putin is trying to get away from the Rothchilds family banking cartel. Thats why Nato is trying to ruin them because we are backed by this banking cartel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, but on a &quot;balance of probabilities&quot; scale, I would say it this particular hit was unlikely to have been ordered by Putin. </p>

<p>We know Putin has no qualms about eliminating those he deems &quot;traitors&quot;, be they journalists whose investigations threaten him (Politkovskaya) or FSB agents who defect to MI6 (Litvinenko). But this clumsy, very public mafia-style hit on a political opponent is too blatant, too obviously going to be blamed on him (by the Western media). For me this is another MH17 scenario - a crime committed by western intelligence agencies to be pinned on Putin.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll not speak for others but believe that many in here would never <em>parrot</em> Putin is Pure! </p>

<p>Myself, I just don&#39;t see this as something Putin, nor his minions would have done and honestly they will figure out a way to <em>shape the narrative</em> as the NWO desires.</p>

<p>Putin didn&#39;t lose any sleep over this assassination, anymore than American Presidents lose sleep when TPTB assassinate allied Dictators. </p>

<p>When TPTB take down Assad, all bets are off and Iran will be <em>naked</em>. </p>

<p>We&#39;re all in the grinder, globally, while these Psychopaths Rule over these corrupt Leaders.</p>
