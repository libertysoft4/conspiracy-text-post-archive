<p>The thing is, right now, we don&#39;t have the ability to do shit. We are the majority, the 6 billion and a half that are slaves to the system. The minority, the people who have control of the monetary system, they are the ones with full control. <em>They</em> are the ones allowing poverty to happen, this is their agenda and plan. They are living in the utopia they helped create and mantain, the rest of us are in the other side of the spectrum in the dystopia... What <strong>we</strong> have to do is wake the fuck up, raise awareness of what is happening, how the world works and what&#39;s wrong with it. Billions everyday are passively living their existence slaving away, most of them without a real purpose other than keeping the system alive, just imagine what we all could do focusing on the collective evolution of mankind.</p>

<p>As you said we have all the tools and resources for it, we know it&#39;s possible. The first step is spreading the word...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;d agree that there is no political will to solve exponential population growth. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>overpopulation is a lie</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The numbers don&#39;t lie though, or are you saying that there isn&#39;t 7 billion people currently living on this planet and that future projections are wrong? Short of colonizing another planet or creating cities in the ocean, continued population growth will eventually cause living space problems. It already is in poorer parts of the world. </p>

<p>Are you saying that the elite want the population to continue to grow to unsustainable levels in order to create problems that they then can solve via military means? </p>

<p>BTW, I do agree that we have the ability to feed, water and shelter the whole human race. But unfortunately we absolutely won&#39;t though and people are not going to stop pro-creating and world consumption rates are going to go through the roof. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the numbers of ppl are a lie, infact, it&#39;s probably short. But that doesn&#39;t matter, cause if we used the planet wisely and justly for all, we could supply 70 billion ppl with life styles equal to that of lower class americans. And it&#39;s not like it would take total communism, the rich could still have thier nicer car and larger plot of land. idc 2 be honest, but when someone (like some tele-priets) has a 200 room house and 14 jets while supposively being a public servant...idk, it&#39;s all fucked up.</p>

<p>They want to convience ppl that there are too many ppl so they&#39;re more apathetic to the death counts to come. Soon it will be &quot;well, lest it wasn&#39;t me!&quot; mentality that&#39;s already setting into the world mind set.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry it took me so long to respond. </p>

<p>The thing is, I&#39;m in agreement with you that we have the space on earth, and yes it&#39;s probably true that we could fit everyone into an area the size of Texas, of course that would be silly, but it speaks volumes about how badly the world is organised on a social, economic and political scale. </p>

<p>But of course, this is not going to happen and the fact of the matter is is that by 2050 the population is expected to be at roughly 10 billion and by the end of the century over 14 billion. This <a href="http://www.susps.org/images/worldpopgr.gif">graph</a> ought to at least slightly concern most people, whatever goes up, must, or will come down. There is an issue with how fast the population is growing, especially since the industrial revolution. </p>

<p>The fact of the matter is is that the world population is going to continue to grow, and one day, without the right leaders, it&#39;s going to cause serious problems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m not trying to sell you anything, I&#39;m unsure of what your not buying. </p>

<p>There are 7 billion people on the planet, right? There will be roughly 3 billion more by 2050, and another 4 or more by the end of the century. </p>

<p>The population is increasing, and without the political will (i.e. as long as the world remains as corrupt and backwards as it is today, which I suspect it will), population growth is going to be a serious issue. Population goes up, demand for resources goes up, particularly finite resources. </p>

<p>The population might be sustainable now, but it&#39;s not going to stop growing is it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, that video and this Reddit <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1a0876/eli5_is_overpopulation_of_humans_really_dangerous/">comment</a> has reduced my panic levels lol. I will reconsider the argument. But if your interested, the motivation for this post came from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umFnrvcS6AQ">lecture</a> I linked to in this post, it&#39;s a bit dated, but it&#39;s worth a listen, no BS, just maths and facts, I assure you. </p>
