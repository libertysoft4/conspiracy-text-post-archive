The moment I clicked submit, I checked the &#39;new&#39; tab and my post wasn&#39;t appearing. I thought I might&#39;ve made a mistake, so i resubmitted it with a different source.</p>

<p>This time I was able to see my post in the new tab for a second, but after not even a minute I refreshed and it was already gone.</p>

<p>Then I searched for any other Edward Snowden posts on <a href="/r/todayilearned">/r/todayilearned</a>, and found there are exactly zero to be found.</p>

<p>It&#39;s clear to me the mods of TIL are deliberately censoring Edward Snowden posts on <a href="/r/todayilearned">/r/todayilearned</a>. I&#39;m not sure why they would do this, I just thought I&#39;d post this to let everyone know reddit censorship is very real.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>1)</em></strong> It is by now a &quot;public secret&quot; that if you post negatively about certain topics, especially the NSA, the moderators will removed or moved it to an obscure sub-Reddit.

<li><p><strong><em>3)</em></strong> Reddit is a privately owned firm. They employ people. We call those people Reddit Moderators. The Moderators do what they are told to do. It works exactly like any other branches of the corporate owned media. No need to pretend otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>4)</em></strong> Every single year the USA government spend at least $ 80 billion to keep the NSA running. The NSA employs 1000&#39;s of people who´s only job it is to influence the public debate and consensus. The Reddit Moderators are a part of that. No need to pretend otherwise.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All the time, we see posts critical of the current US hegemony getting removed or people getting their accounts shadow banned. The Intelligence Community has a firm grip on the mass media. No Need to pretend otherwise.</p>

<p>I was just saying that the other guy&#39;s post is factually inaccurate and implies that <em>all</em> mods are paid employees of reddit and/or working for the NSA to influence public debate.  Which is totally untrue (although it most likely is true for <em>certain</em> mods/subreddits/etc.)</p>

<p>I did read that last comment, but you said &quot;moderators are not paid by reddit...though I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if certain ones in key positions are.&quot;   My comment was regarding gov&#39;t workers manipulating reddit.  Maybe I don&#39;t think of gov&#39;t interests as the same as actual gov&#39;t workers.  </p>

<p>And I honestly don&#39;t believe you really think that he meant , EVERY SINGLE MOD.  I think you dramatized what he said.  I get it, he said &quot;the reddit moderators,&quot; but I&#39;m 100% sure he didn&#39;t mean &quot;ALL.&quot;  To point that word indiscretion to point out that it was&quot; factually inaccurate&quot; was a little over the top.  I don&#39;t think anyone here thought he meant &quot;all&quot; moderators where gov&#39;t shills.</p>

<p>Regardless of what he <em>meant</em>, what he actually <em>said</em> was that &quot;moderators are paid by reddit&quot;.  This is just a factually incorrect statement, period.  If reddit worked the way it&#39;s claimed to, not a single moderator would be paid.  Now, of course, it most likely doesn&#39;t work that way, and some mods most likely are compensated to manipulate and push various agendas, but I was just pointing out that the other guy&#39;s comment was misleading from where I&#39;m sitting and I&#39;ve seen him copy/paste it in multiple places with the same inaccuracy.</p>

<p>When will any mod address who &#39;david chandler&#39; was, as it pertains to the fake richard gage ama.</p>

<p>It seems a certain moderator wants to take out the most important members of the 911 truth movement. </p>

<p>Every time the question is brought up, the user who asks the question is either banned or their comment is erased.</p>

<p>Please address the claims others aren&#39;t willing to talk about.

    <div class="md"><p>the main issue isn&#39;t the reddit admins, its the sub mods.  There are also companies that buy high karma accts.  Also, there are companies where you can buy votes, in increments in the thousands.  </p>

<p>The problem is the cognitive infiltration element.  And as the Snowden leaks told us, there are gov&#39;t agencies that specifically target social media, and we all know how readily that happens on reddit.  Its something that just really can&#39;t be stopped.  </p>

<p>I believe there are mods in several subs employed by the NSA, but not so sure if reddit admins are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um...no, not so fast. When and under what circumstances have 0 tolerance policies ever worked before, at all? Everyone&#39;s definition of what a &quot;shill&quot; is, is going to be at least slightly different, in most cases probably <em>very</em> different. Discretion is always a necessary tool towards fair policing. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand why people never seem to mention that a power check against the admins absolute power would go a long way towards solving a lot of the problems we all complain about. How about introducing a democratic element into how the admins are chosen?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t thinking that normal users like you and I would vote. That would be awesome, but anyone can have multiple accounts, and then what you said is very correct. So my next idea was that mods would vote about things, publicly, but then again, a lot of mods are obviously corrupt, but it becomes easier to see what they are doing and hold them accountable. Several ways that could be done.</p>

<p>Genuinely curious, what would be the basic design of a system that wouldn&#39;t need admins? A type of &quot;open source&quot; reddit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shill - sorry...<em>chill</em> out for sec...</p>

<p>What&#39;s your definition of a shill? Seriously, let&#39;s see if we can even find agreement on that. For me, that definition would have include very technical things, like duplicate comments and posts etc, but only those things. If someone&#39;s obviously taking the time to write out responses, even if it seems pretty clear they are a shill, I wouldn&#39;t argue for banning them.</p>

<p>I think there are better ways of defeating those accounts than your eloquently worded &quot;banhammer&quot;.</p>

If the article or post is.too hyperbolic it draws opposing voices, if it is sensible it usually draws voices of agreement.

    <div class="md"><p>Shill - sorry...<em>chill</em> out for sec...</p>

<p>What&#39;s your definition of a shill? Seriously, let&#39;s see if we can even find agreement on that. For me, that definition would have include very technical things, like duplicate comments and posts etc, but only those things. If someone&#39;s obviously taking the time to write out responses, even if it seems pretty clear they are a shill, I wouldn&#39;t argue for banning them.</p>

<p>I think there are better ways of defeating those accounts than your eloquently worded &quot;banhammer&quot;.</p>
