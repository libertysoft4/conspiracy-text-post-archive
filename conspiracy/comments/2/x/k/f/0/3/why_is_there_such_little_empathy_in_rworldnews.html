        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A militia is the natural response to oppression, stop the oppression and you&#39;ll guarantee peace, only through Israels continued illegal expansion will you continue the war. Israel is the more developed country granted but they sure as hell are not the bigger people in the situation in Gaza. </p>

<p>For the people who are going to scream anti-semite I leave you with this: why can the jews have a Jewish state, the Christians have theirs so why can&#39;t Islam have theirs? It&#39;s not because they&#39;re religious beliefs conflict with the western ideology of capitalism, debt and interest is it?</p>

<p>My Muslim friends (yes you can have them) give the interest they earn each year to charity, why? Because they don&#39;t believe in interest, that is the difference between the Jewish and Muslims one wants you to pay them interest the other doesn&#39;t and would only give it away.</p>

<p>Keep your allies close and your enemies closer, hit it on the head there Israel</p>

<p>Down vote this, it&#39;s what I expect. JIDF are a go; we are but goyim to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the people I know are Protestant Christians (including myself) and yet they think all Muslims are horrible terrorists. I remember being taught to love and care for all others as if they were all my closest neighbours, and I do. I try my hardest, even with the ones that name names and disrupt my education, and yet I fail to realise why everyone hates Muslims so much. Every Muslim I&#39;ve met so far had almost identical morals to me, followed a similar religion than me, and actually had a heritage that was located much closer to the holy lands than me (I&#39;ve got dutch/boer heritage). All in all Muslims are very nice people, and are actually open to see the world through other peoples eyes, unlike most westerners. Muslims have faced horrible living conditions simply because of America&#39;s anti Muslim propergander. I don&#39;t think this is right, and yet like most; I can&#39;t simply do a thing to stop it.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not &quot;merely&quot; doing that, right?  You know that.  That&#39;s why you caveated your post with an acknowledgement that you&#39;ll be downvoted.

    <div class="md"><p>I know, I am guilty of a bit of generalisation. </p>

<p>This society hurts; because for someone who views everyone indifferently and completely equal, every death in the pursuit of material gain is a complete and utter waste. Looked at from the perspective of a more advanced sentient being having stumbled upon earth our global society is feudalistic in nature and so utterly destructive it has no rightful place in the ecosystem of the planet; we are essentially an invasive species, a parasite, no better than a cancerous tumour. </p>

<p>The most terrible terrible truth is that we are a sentient tumour which knows what&#39;s it&#39;s doing and has the choice to do otherwise; we know the last thing left for us is changing the entire thing but we&#39;re all so scared we&#39;re gonna have less afterwards than we do now so nothing is done. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I guess I can&#39;t appeal to your empathy, so, I&#39;ll try a different way.</p>

<p>You keep using the &quot;truth&quot; but, I feel like there exists some lateral interpretations to your statements.</p>

<p>With the difference between Jews and Muslims, I&#39;ll use the fact that it&#39;s absurd to claim that Jewish people don&#39;t donate huge amounts of money.  It&#39;s as equally absurd to believe that your small cross-section of Islamic friends represent all Muslims.</p>

<p>Additionally, it&#39;s not like banks in the middle east that practice Sharia Banking are entirely non profit and altruistic in nature.  They make money off investments and trading like any other banking institution, they just can&#39;t charge interest on loans.</p>

<p>Also, your assertion that Palestine is the only Islamic state in the world is flawed.  Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, these are all, in name, Islamic republics.  While you use &quot;truth&quot; as your shield, it should be obvious there can be, at the very least, differing interpretations.</p>

<p>Ahhh but that fact alone if it were applied to our banking system in West would benefit the majority of the population; if applied to countries...</p>

<p>I have never stated palestine is the only Islamic state; it would be incredibly ignorant to say they are, not just because of the countries you&#39;ve mentioned, but because you need to aknowledge the non-muslim inhabitants. Regardless though, they are not a recognised state.</p>

I remember being taught to love and care for all others as if they were all my closest neighbours, and I do. I try my hardest, even with the ones that name names and disrupt my education, and yet I fail to realise why everyone hates Muslims so much. Every Muslim I&#39;ve met so far had almost identical morals to me, followed a similar religion than me, and actually had a heritage that was located much closer to the holy lands than me (I&#39;ve got dutch/boer heritage). All in all Muslims are very nice people, and are actually open to see the world through other peoples eyes, unlike most westerners. Muslims have faced horrible living conditions simply because of America&#39;s anti Muslim propergander.
