        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I wanted to show <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> how deceptive Jewish media outlets can be in nature: The &#39;JP&#39; posted a brand new headline article today in which they made claims Iran made a mock up of an American Aircraft in orders to have a little circle jerk about it and shoot off missiles:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/WATCH-Iranian-cruise-missiles-blow-up-life-size-replica-of-American-aircraft-carrier-392156">http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/WATCH-Iranian-cruise-missiles-blow-up-life-size-replica-of-American-aircraft-carrier-392156</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>He added that &quot;the Americans, and the entire world, know that the American Navy is one of our targets, and it will take us 50 seconds to destroy every US warship.&quot;</p>

<p>During the military exercise, titled, &quot;The Great Prophet,&quot; the Iranian military booby-trapped the Strait of Hormuz and fired surface-to-surface Fateh-110 missiles some 300 km.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its basically your average Jewish-made non-sensical its another holocaust if we don&#39;t do something rant. What they conveniently ignore is that this is a movie prop: <a href="http://time.com/34963/iran-aircraft-carrier/">http://time.com/34963/iran-aircraft-carrier/</a> made to televise an event that happened a long time ago when the US shot down an Iranian civilian aircraft killing everyone on board. </p>

<p>But as you should know by now, Jews do not want truth to come out. They take a tragic event that happened to Iranians, flip it around to be anti-American, because its all inherently anti-Jew, for the sake of preventing &#39;anonther holocaust&#39;.</p>

<p>Let it sink in the layers of deception that are on-going with Israeli Jews. Next time you reflexively throw the word anti-semitism out there or feel embarassed for being a part of a sub that questions these notions, realize that we have all been conditioned not to question it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>FYI dude no one with a brain in America supports Israel - only crazy religious nuts/irrational fundamentalists support or view Israel kindly, the rest of America views it as a little apartheid state full of crazy jewish people out in the deserts currently in the process of systematically brutalizing the human beings they violently stole the land they&#39;re on from, and that&#39;s almost the &quot;mainstream view&quot; in non-christian-fundamentalist land America(because it&#39;s just an obvious truth, it&#39;s equatable to a bunch of arabs coming and stealing Kansas because the OPEC council told them it was &quot;theirs now&quot;).</p>

<p>I would think there are very few rational adults who believe anything that comes from Haaretz or JP is anything other than propaganda coming from a people terrified that other people are going to visit upon them the violence they are visiting on others.</p>

<p>Whereas Iran is frequently described as &quot;one of the friendliest places to travel on earth&quot; from people who have been there and you guys currently aren&#39;t systematically brutalizing your neighbors.</p>

You should check out putin&#39;s rise to power documentary, it&#39;s what made me actually doubt the official 9/11 narrative and see truth in some theories, putin is as bad as they come, if anything he showed bush how effective his false flags were, he was the first foreign leader to contact the white house in the wake of the event saying something along the lines of &quot;Russia knows your pain&quot;.. yea no shit you used the exact same play book to start a war on &quot;terrorists&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But he defended Bashar al Assad against the allegations of chemical weapons, and he was right.   His support if Assad as well as Iran has unwavered in spite of all the war horse propaganda spewed out against them.  Of course Putin is going to try and use propaganda, that&#39;s how you play the game.  As far as meddling with smaller countries, I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re getting that.  Is there something I&#39;m missing about the Ukraine situation?  Is Russia really invading Ukraine, or is that what&#39;s being perpetuated in the media?  Some of the videos I&#39;ve seen show Ukrainians bombing their own villiages trying to blame it on pro Russian rebels.  To me, that says a lot.  It&#39;s actually quite vital to consider this into the conflicts in the Middle East.  How important is it to make Russia look bad?  Extremely.  They support the governments of Syria <em>and</em> Iran.  Who doesn&#39;t like those governments?  I&#39;m sure you can tell...</p>

<p>To me, a better solution would be to completely open up the markets for currency exchange, allow as many different competing currencies as possible, and let consumers/the market decide which ones are working most effectively and which ones need to go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but regardless of whatever they are or are not doing, Russia is still a member of this organization it&#39;s apparently waging war against (both economic and literal).  To me this makes no sense whatsoever and is at least worthy of some skepticism on all of our parts.  The collusion between east and west has been apparent since at least the Bolshevik Revolution, but now these days there seems to be this idea that Russia is suddenly a sovereign nation who&#39;s opposed to the western elite and I just am not convinced of that yet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And are they allowing russia to do this? Really? Ukraine?</p>

<p>But again, fighting a war with them - meanwhile they&#39;re all members of the same globalist organizations.  It doesn&#39;t make logical sense, at least not to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the east and west drama is as fake as the repub versus dem nonsense in American politics.  Just another divide and conquer strategy, but one even deep thinking conspiracy theorists can believe and digest because the ptb and msn sources are clearly unified in their criticism of the east (Russia, china), making it easier for naysayers like us to recognize as bs and oppose.  </p>

<p>Maybe I am wrong, but I think the true conspiracy is that all the big countries with nukes and other advanced military tech are in cahoots on dividing the world into mini federations.  For example US takes Iraq so Russia gets Iran, etc...  Russia and the US are both dividing portions of the mid east right now for resources and for israel. It&#39;s all bargaining.  The only time an authentic beef arises (imo), is when one side goes farther than what they bargained for (ie us in ukraine) or when they can&#39;t reach a deal on how they are going to jointly and covertly conquer smaller resource rich or geographically relevant countries.</p>

<p>But why would Iran need a carrier for a movie prop when that plane was shot down by a missile cruiser?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one said you couldn&#39;t?</p>

<p>You can dislike those who make these decisions. The OP says specifically in their title that the articles make them dislike &quot;Israelis&quot;, as in all the people within the country. He then goes on to say things like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jews do not want truth to come out</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So clearly he is talking about the Jewish people as a whole. This is anti-semitism, with a very poor disguise of taking issue with israeli media.</p>

<p>Are there individuals who will call you an anti-semite for disliking Israeli foreign policy or the things that listed in your post? Yes. And those people are wrongly taking advantage of an actual problem to gain support. No one moral supports that.</p>

<p>But...when you take this behaviour and attribute to all individual Israeli&#39;s or even further, to Jews as a whole, then we have a problem. This is a distinction that I don&#39;t often see considered in this subreddit. Many act that because false accusations or racism and anti-semitism occur, that anti-semitism is some false concept.</p>

<p>For a parallel example, I assume the American members of this community would take issue with being lumped in to American foreign policy. </p>

<p>This is racist. An entire Ethno-Religious group comprised of millions of people cannot be proclaimed guilty of anything solely because of their heritage. Implying otherwise is the definition of racism. If you feel comfortable saying something like that, you are likely a racist.</p>

<p>Is the education you receive in high school the best, or most complete? Of course not. In fact, depending on the school, it may be downright shitty. But compared to the comically ignorant, backwards, insane, hate-driven nonsense you are attempting to spew, collected from historically illiterate cesspools such as Stormfront or various other politically and emotionally motivated sites, I&#39;d say even the worst hight school provides a more effective education. At least school get their textbooks from actual historians and not some bald-headed Fuck who is going to head out and try to earn his red laces after he&#39;s finished with his blog post.</p>
