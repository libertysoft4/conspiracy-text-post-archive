<p>It was quite the coincidence, but it could be more.</p>

<p>Edit: What is even stranger is the fact that almost all of the shooters involved in those cases reported voices telling them to do it, and other symptoms that are characteristic of mind control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think we as a community should write anyone off as a crazy religious dude. I think he&#39;s possessed by a certain urgency that I myself have sometimes found myself experiencing after certain information gets revealed to you. </p>

<p>Despite what some of us may think, no one in here actually knows what&#39;s really going on in the world. I think I hold a pretty out there yet reasonable position however, relative to many of the people I hang out with, I could definitely come off as a crazy religious dude.</p>

<p>I think much of the information that <a href="/u/thekingofsocialmedia">/u/thekingofsocialmedia</a> presents is quite interesting and am often surprised with the negative responses and borderline ridicule he faces from some members of the community. I find it highly likely that there is a significant concentration of &quot;evil&quot; surrounding this company and its associates. The hierarchical nature of these controlling systems means that these individuals have access to some extremely sensitive information and with near zero conscience it&#39;s almost impossible to imagine what sort of things they&#39;d be willing to do to to benefit their interests.</p>

<p>Much of the technology for targeted individuals and mind control they talk about in <a href="/r/DigitalCartel">/r/DigitalCartel</a> does exist or would be reasonable to assume does exist. The more I&#39;ve researched I&#39;ve also found historical/metaphorical correlates for many of the events of the old testament. Interactions with higher forms of consciousness in similar fashions to contemporary channels, and psychonauts could even go some way to explain ideas of prophets. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve definitely been much more conscious and integrated with our cosmological and spiritual components in the past. Who know&#39;s what&#39;s going on today to interfere with those elements of consciousness?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is very true, there is definitely a message... as kindof a bystander just looking at that sub since its inception, i too find it fascinating for several reasons..</p>

<p>Firstly, this person believes that a &quot;cyber caliphate&quot; will be artificially manufactured by northrop gunnamm <em>sp</em> as a false flag to fundamentally change the internet. Thats an interesting proposition..</p>

<p>Secondly, this messiah complex thing going on with Eric, and that entire story</p>

<p>Thirdly, the mind control aspects that somehow are trying to be shown as connected to N.G. and recent false flags that coincidentally enough have N.G. corporate sites near them...</p>

<p>aside from those things, i really dont know what is up... i secretly( not anymore i guess) am concerned about the potential for this subreddit to be used in some way as a falseflag cyber op</p>
