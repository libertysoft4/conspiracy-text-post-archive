    <div class="md"><p>Wonder why?  This is a well-known problem, with well-known roots.  Christians were not allowed to give loans for interest, a sin called usury, which Jews could do.  The kings would allow the jewish bankers into the country, borrow from them very heavily, and then kick them out so they didn&#39;t have to pay the debts.  They would come up with bullshit reasons to expel them, and even murder a few, just so they didn&#39;t have to pay.  Most of those european kings who kicked out jews were delinquents and profligate wastrels.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Bonus!  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhambra_Decree#Decree">Spain</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_France#Expulsions_and_returns">France</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>Did you not read your source? King Edward was making a lot of money by having high taxes imposed on the Jews from usury with the English people. There was no sign of &#39;antisemitism&#39; in his decision to expel them. They were necessary to his income.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jews acquired a reputation as extortionate money lenders which made them extremely unpopular with both the Church and the general public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it&#39;s totally not the Jews fault that they were in a position of prestige and trust, and they fucked it up? Why is it <em>never</em> their fault?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only have I read that, but I&#39;ve also not lived under a rock as far as history goes.  I was kinda stunned when you asked for a source, since I thought that this general historical knowledge was pretty well known.  </p>

<p>The Jews had been used this way by royalty since Roman times, as personal private bankers for the emperor.  Technically, they were the emperors&#39; personal slaves, and some of them were richer than the richest senators.  </p>

<p>Because the Jews were not legally allowed to work in anything else.  Because they were practically the private property of the king, who told them that the only way they can make money (since they weren&#39;t really allowed to own or manage property, and the guilds certainly wouldn&#39;t take them in to have a job) was to engage in loaning money to people.  And you must realize that the king wanted credit to be more fluid in the kingdom, so he needed there to be bankers willing to loan money at interest.  No one else was allowed to loan money at interest, so when someone says &quot;oh no he&#39;s extorting me for this loan I can&#39;t repay&quot; they&#39;ll just blame the jews instead of themselves for taking out a loan they can&#39;t repay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s play out a scenario.<br/>
You work for the king, who has said you can have one job, loaning out money at interest.
He makes money off you doing that job.
He starts a war, funded by the money you&#39;re making lending.
He needs more money, so he starts taking a bigger cut, as well as encouraging people to use his lendors to get loans backed by him.  Rates go up.
He needs even more money, so he borrows from you.  Rates go up.
He decides you&#39;re making too much money, so he has you pay special taxes that no one else pays.  Rates go up.
Eventually you can&#39;t loan him any more money because he&#39;s borrowed so much he&#39;ll never repay you.  On top of that, since the loans are essentially backed by his own credit, the other loans become much riskier.  So the credit dries up &#39;cause no one can get a loan.
Rates go way, way up; while at the same time, the economy crashes because of a credit crunch. 
Because you won&#39;t loan the king money, and now he&#39;s a bit broke, and he wants to keep going to war, he decides to take all of your possessions and wealth, then kicks you out of the country.
No, I don&#39;t &quot;blame the Jews.&quot;  Ruling powers didn&#39;t understand finance at all.  The same thing happened to the Knights Templar, who also became the bankers of royalty, then got expelled.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying the Jews were richer than royalty? That&#39;s ridiculous. Why would the King borrow from the Jews when he already takes a big cut, eliminating most of their profit anyway? Rates don&#39;t just &#39;go up&#39; because the king needs more money for his wars, and if they do, they&#39;re nothing but greedy bankers who don&#39;t want to take the hit themselves so they pass it onto the serfs below them.</p>

<p>And the first war in the 13th century was in 1215. And not only did the King give Jews 15 years to readjust to the ban on usury, but the whole process of banning Jews took ~60 years. I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re implying this was some &#39;get rich quick&#39; scheme you&#39;re implying.</p>

<li>Refuse to allow Zionist-Jews to then drag the U.S. into that war of choice started by Israel.</li>
<li>Keep Israel related issues, and Israeli Govt. Officials the fuck out of U.S. politics, U.S. elections, and U.S. Congress</li>

    <div class="md"><p>That was painful to watch but I guess the TLDR is Israel wants US to fight for them against Iran because Khomeini <em>&quot;tweeted&quot;</em> a threat to Israel and Israel is apparently absolutely terrified of their nuclear programs... 
Also is the constant clapping after each sentence a common thing in US congress? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;-goons in Gaza, lackeys in Lebanon, revolutionary Guards in Golan heights&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is using Alliteration, but correct me if am wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Alliteration serves to &quot;intensify any attitude being signified&quot;.-<a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliteration#Historical_use">wiki</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So is this like a guaranteed declaration of war with Iran or are they going to wait a bit before rolling out?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only have I read that, but I&#39;ve also not lived under a rock as far as history goes.  I was kinda stunned when you asked for a source, since I thought that this general historical knowledge was pretty well known.  </p>

<p>The Jews had been used this way by royalty since Roman times, as personal private bankers for the emperor.  Technically, they were the emperors&#39; personal slaves, and some of them were richer than the richest senators.  </p>

<p>Because the Jews were not legally allowed to work in anything else.  Because they were practically the private property of the king, who told them that the only way they can make money (since they weren&#39;t really allowed to own or manage property, and the guilds certainly wouldn&#39;t take them in to have a job) was to engage in loaning money to people.  And you must realize that the king wanted credit to be more fluid in the kingdom, so he needed there to be bankers willing to loan money at interest.  No one else was allowed to loan money at interest, so when someone says &quot;oh no he&#39;s extorting me for this loan I can&#39;t repay&quot; they&#39;ll just blame the jews instead of themselves for taking out a loan they can&#39;t repay.</p>
