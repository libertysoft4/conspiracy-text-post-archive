<p>Some would argue the corporate control of this Union extends back to when the Bull-Moose lost the election of 1912; and with the Aldrich plan coming to fruition under Wilson, I have a tough time arguing that point.</p>

It was a silent coup d état perpetrated by the very forces that a sitting president warned us about a few decades earlier. No one heeded that warning, &amp; those forces grew into a nasty, black octopus-squid from hell, killed the one person who saw what was happening &amp; could change things, to try steer America back in the right direction.

<p>From the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

<p><strong>United States examples</strong></p>

<p><strong>Federal Communications Commission</strong></p>

<p>Legal scholars have pointed to the possibility that federal agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had been captured by media conglomerates. Peter Schuck of Yale Law School has argued that the FCC is subject to capture by the media industries&#39; leaders and therefore reinforce the operation of corporate cartels in a form of &quot;corporate socialism&quot; that serves to &quot;regressively tax consumers, impoverish small firms, inhibit new entry, stifle innovation, and diminish consumer choice&quot;.[40] The FCC selectively granted communications licenses to some radio and television stations in a process that excludes other citizens and little stations from having access to the public.[41]</p>

<p>Michael K. Powell, who served on the FCC for eight years and was chairman for four, was appointed president and chief executive officer of the National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association, a lobby group. As of April 25, 2011, he will be the chief lobbyist and the industry&#39;s liaison with Congress, the White House, the FCC and other federal agencies.[42]</p>

<p>Meredith Attwell Baker was one of the FCC commissioners who approved a controversial merger between NBC Universal and Comcast. Four months later, she announced her resignation from the FCC to join Comcast&#39;s Washington, D.C. lobbying office.[43] Legally, she is prevented from lobbying anyone at the FCC for two years and an agreement made by Comcast with the FCC as a condition of approving the merger will ban her from lobbying any executive branch agency for life.[43] Nonetheless, Craig Aaron, of Free Press, who opposed the merger, complained that &quot;the complete capture of government by industry barely raises any eyebrows&quot; and said public policy would continue to suffer from the &quot;continuously revolving door at the FCC&quot;.[43]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NN is good because it means less monopoly power, because it allows consumers more choice.</p>

<p>Being against unnessarry regulation is one thing, being against monopoly breakups is another. Once this goes into effect you won&#39;t be forced to get your Internet from a single ISP. This benefits everyone.</p>

<p>And, in regards to &quot;obamacare for the internet&quot;, the FCC doesn&#39;t have the power to regulate the actual content that flows through the internet&#39;s tubes. Otherwise, porn sites wouldn&#39;t exist because the FCC has been censoring it on TV and Radio for a long time. The new ruling makes it much more difficult for an ISP to gouge websites and customers, therefore making information more free. If you seriously think that this particlular ruling will create censorship, then you misunderstand it completely. The FCC does not have the power to regulate the content of individual websites. Even if they did, this particular ruling would make it easier for people to setup and access websites that would otherwise be gouged out of existence by ISPs. </p>

<p>And finally, if you think the Internet wasn&#39;t somehow regulated by the FCC beforehand you&#39;re severely mistaken too. The FCC predates the Internet and has been effectively regulating it for it&#39;s entire history especially considering that the original Internet ran on telephone lines, which is also heavily regulated -but not censored- by the FCC. </p>

<p>It&#39;s perferctly responsible to be sucpicious of the government, but don&#39;t let paranoia eat you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because you can choose a different ISP. The end goal here is to force Comcast to lease lines out to smaller companies, as is done with telephone service. And, as I&#39;ve already mentioned, the Internet is effectively the same as telephone service (from a regulatory standpoint). The new ruling means cheaper service and more options for consumers.</p>

<p>Likewise, if you think the FCC did not already have monopoly power over digital communications, you&#39;re serverely mistaken. The entire reason your computer can connect from one ISP to another is because of century-old FCC regulations. There was a time when people requried multiple telephone hookups/utility service just to make calls into different teleco areas. This is one of the few situations where the goverment has done something positive for the average person.</p>

<p>How can you say that so certainly without having read a page of the 300+ page document?  That&#39;s an educated guess at best on your part.  Having said that, I hope you&#39;re right - but time will tell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re not crazy.  It&#39;s how we evolved.  For thousands of years the less knowledgeable have been guided by the more knowledgeable.  This new world demands increasing levels of autonomy and &quot;uniqueness&quot;--a desire to carve out individual experiences based on the quasi accessible sum of human knowledge.  A side effect of this has been a basic desire to be curious about and question so many more aspects of human society than the populace had ever really even considered before.</p>

<p>Thinking is also extraordinarily hard work much like physical labor.  It is a natural inclination to avoid it in favor of a more facile approach to survival, even if this approach is not necessarily superior.</p>

If they want to plant pro government supporters in the comments section of every YouTube video, blog, and forum like the Russian and Chinese governments do, then they&#39;ll accomplish that as well. Regardless of who in the end controls the internet, the government will get its way. The biggest danger in this case was not the NSA feeling emboldened to do what it has already been doing for two administrations now, but companies denying access and services when it suits them. </p>

<p>Also, I haven&#39;t read the bill, obviously, but I&#39;m pretty sure it is really about censorship, which would explain why &#39;Reddit&#39; is throwing a party; they love that censorship shit.  Just look at all the things that already get censored on reddit.  With great power, comes wanting even greater power...</p>

<p>Individuals will need to be reminded about being responsible for the decisions that they make.  From the scientist that chooses to build bombs instead of something constructive, to the policeman who was &quot;just following orders&quot;, and even the politicians who will say they were doing this &quot;for national security&quot;, they have made these decisions for their own benefit and accountability is not always only for the &quot;little people&quot;.</p>

<p>How can you say that so certainly without having read a page of the 300+ page document?  That&#39;s an educated guess at best on your part.  Having said that, I hope you&#39;re right - but time will tell.</p>
