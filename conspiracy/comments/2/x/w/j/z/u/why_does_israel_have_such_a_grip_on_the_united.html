<p>I know this subreddit can be full of memes and click-bait at times, so I want to take this opportunity now for anyone with legitimate knowledge and sources to please share with the rest of us. What are the direct links between the United States and the embarrassingly blatant influence Israel has on our politics, culture and military?</p>

<p>Who are the people? How is the money distributed? How did it get this way? And, where will it lead the US? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t ask this to start argument, I earnestly ask this to be informed. Thank you in advance. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cis.org/articles/2001/back1301.html">quoting Stephen Steinlight</a> (Senior Policy Analyst at Center for Immigration Studies):</p>

<p>I&#39;ll confess it, at least: like thousands of other typical Jewish kids of my generation, I was reared as a Jewish nationalist, even a quasi-separatist. Every summer for two months for 10 formative years during my childhood and adolescence I attended Jewish summer camp. There, each morning, I saluted a foreign flag, dressed in a uniform reflecting its colors, sang a foreign national anthem, learned a foreign language, learned foreign folk songs and dances, and was taught that Israel was the true homeland. Emigration to Israel was considered the highest virtue, and, like many other Jewish teens of my generation, I spent two summers working in Israel on a collective farm while I contemplated that possibility. More tacitly and subconsciously, I was taught the superiority of my people to the gentiles who had oppressed us. We were taught to view non-Jews as untrustworthy outsiders, people from whom sudden gusts of hatred might be anticipated, people less sensitive, intelligent, and moral than ourselves. We were also taught that the lesson of our dark history is that we could rely on no one.</p>

<p>The majority of  bankers are in fact not Jewish, but are white gentile Knights of Malta. </p>

<p>The New York Stock Exchange on Wallstreet was directed by Edward L. Hennessy, Jr. - a Knight of Malta (and member of other Knighthoods), and former financial adviser to the Vatican!</p>

<p>As for the media, Redstone, the owner of Viacom received training from Jesuit Georgetown University. Rupert Murdoch is a Knight of St. Gregory. Director Emeritus of Disney until his death was Roy Disney, who was also a Papal Knight in the Roman Catholic Order of St. Gregory. Also notable is the fact that since 1996, a man named Leo J. O&#39;Donovan, S.J. has been on the board of Disney. O&#39;Donovan is a Jesuit priest and the former President of Georgetown University, the Jesuit stronghold of Washington DC. NBC&#39;s key people including its CEO are Roman Catholics and Bob Wright who served as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at NBC , having had one of the &quot;longest and most successful tenures of any media company Chief Executive&quot; is also a Roman Catholic who was educated at Jesuit Holy Cross College. CBS is owned by Viacom, which we&#39;ve already covered. As of 2009, one of the directors of CBS Corporation, Joseph A. Califano, Jr., is a Roman Catholic man who was also Jesuit-trained at the College of the Holy Cross, the Jesuit fortress of Massachusetts. Califano is a Papal Knight of Malta. Another of their directors, Charles K. Gifford, was Chairman Emeritus of the Bank of America, which is 51% owned by the Jesuits and was founded by a Knight of Malta (A.P. Gianni). Another director is Robert D. Walter, who is Roman Catholic. Etc..</p>

<p>Edit: I don&#39;t think people in this forum really get it now. But I&#39;ll put it out there anyway. Israel is <strong>not</strong> the problem here. Nor is America. They are both just symptoms of the disease.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The struggle between the people and the hatred amongst them is being nurtured by very specific interested parties.</em> <strong>It is a small, rootless, international clique that is turning people against each other, that does not want them to have peace.</strong> <em>It is the people both at home nowhere and everywhere, who do not have anywhere a soil in which they have grown up, but who live in Berlin today, Brussels tomorrow, Paris the day after that, and then in Prague or Vienna or London and feel at home everywhere. They are the only ones who can be addressed as international elements, because they conduct their businesses everywhere, but the people cannot follow them.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The center of power in the US are the privately owned Federal Reserve Banks with their relationships to Wall Street Mega banks. If you don&#39;t understand the Feds role, (with the Mega Banks) in your economy you cannot understand who owns/ controls your political system. </p>

<p>The first and only study that revealed its owners was done by Eustace Mullins more than 65 years ago. It turned out that they were all Jewish families from Europe, the Rothschilds being the most powerful.</p>

<p>Mullins at the time had to virtually camp out at the library of Congress for many months to get this information, which he put into his book &quot;Secrets of the Federal Reserve&quot;.</p>

<p>Pretty much all &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; especially Anti Zionist stuff on the Internet today derives from Mullins&#39; work. Pretty much all of it, either repeats his work or is bogus, (most of it).</p>

<p>In any case the Rothschilds were behind the Balfour declaration and the formation of the State of Israel by writing off war debts in exchange for political favors.</p>

<p>Today who owns the Federal Reserve banks is a secret more closely guarded than advanced nuclear technology. Those who talk don&#39;t know and those who know don&#39;t talk.</p>

<p>But it is highly likely that the Rothschilds are still major owners. And while a one to one identity between that family and the state of Israel is almost certainly untrue, it is clear that Israel is the Rothschild family&#39;s favorite charity. </p>

<p>From a military standpoint, by now the American and Israeli Military Industrial Complexes are completely interwoven and the CIA and the Mossad work as brothers, (who sometimes bicker) to do jobs for each other.</p>

<p>What it all boils down to however, is that your congress and political system is a giant whore house which sells itself to those with the most money. And the uber rich Jewish financial families have more of it than pretty much anyone and are for your politicians their very best customers.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re saying none of them even have this thing - but they MIGHT, so we should stop it. But people who have other passports, Canadian ones and such. That&#39;s not a conflict of interest?

<blockquote>
<p>Isreal would never, ever extradite for tax evasion or any of that bankster shit either, lol</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neither would any western country.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many think Isreal is a very fucked up place, full of crazy Jews and love the US very much and would rather live in Greenland than Isreal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven&#39;t met many Jews who think this. Israel is the most multicultural place in the middle east and the only place with freedom of press, religious freedom, etc. I&#39;d rather live in Greenland than the middle east too. But short of Istanbul I&#39;m not sure many other cities in the middle east I&#39;d want to go as a white guy other than Tel Aviv</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The right wing and the Hasidic Jews totally freak them out. I actually once knew a Dutch Jewish woman once. Emigrated to US, then Isreal. Hated it so much she came back to US. Jus sayin...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I know an Australian who left Australia specifically to go join the IDF and never came back, and I never heard from him again. People vary a lot. I think there are a lot of right wingers in Israel but it&#39;s the Jewish homeland, peolpe will gravitate towards it. You&#39;ll see it with comedians - some talk about going to ISrael as if it was amazing, some hate it. I figure it&#39;s the same amongst most jews.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t see how having two passports would effect anything, I don&#39;t think the US congress could become any more pro-israel or anti-muslim at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speak for direct sources, but I do know the Evangelical population of the US has a positive religious bias towards Israel. My grandma&#39;s church hosts an event called &quot;A Night to Honor Israel,&quot; and I&#39;m 99% sure my Pentecostal parents take it literally when God says to the Israelites, &quot;I will bless those that bless you, and curse those who curse you,&quot; in the Bible. I&#39;m paraphrasing, so no precise scriptural reference, but they think that still applies to the Israeli population in the middle east today. Since they make up maybe a quarter of the US population and tend to be more vocal about their beliefs they tend to have some sway on American foreign policy in that arena.<br/>
Googling the event just now brought me to <a href="http://www.cufi.org/site/PageServer">this website</a> for a group called Christians United for Israel, which has what it calls &quot;The Israel Pledge&quot; on the bottom of the page:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We believe that the Jewish people have a right to live in their ancient land of Israel, and that the modern State of Israel is the fulfillment of this historic right.</em> </p>

<p><em>We maintain that there is no excuse for acts of terrorism against Israel and that Israel has the same right as every other nation to defend her citizens from such violent attacks.</em> </p>

<p><em>We pledge to stand with our brothers and sisters in Israel and to speak out on their behalf whenever and wherever necessary until the attacks stop and they are finally living in peace and security with their neighbors.</em>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That jives with a lot of what I heard in church growing up whenever this topic was broached, so it&#39;s probably somewhat familiar to enough of the Christians in America to be relevant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all starts with the fairly recent theology called &quot;dispensationalism&quot;.</p>

<p>Dispensationalists believe that the nation of Israel is distinct from the Christian Church,[2]:322 and that God has yet to fulfill his promises to national Israel. These promises include the land promises, which in the future world to come result in a millennial kingdom and Third Temple where Christ, upon his return, will rule the world from Jerusalem for a thousand years. </p>

<p>In other words, promises to Israel from the Bible are still waiting to be fulfilled, and it is evangelical&#39;s belief that they can assist this by helping Israel.</p>

<p>To find out how this happened, look at C. I. Scofield and the &quot;Scofied Study Bible&quot; which gives a very Protestant worldview, including a lot of  eschatological speculation. </p>

<p>George Bush believed this and supported the Iraq war in part to do his part of defending Israel against the biblical foes Gog and Magog.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Idealogically speaking. the U.S. is generally committed to supporting democracy. Israel is a committed democracy in an area with a strong trend towards theocracy and dictatorships.</p>

<p>2) Religiously speaking. the American Evangelical Right tends to support Zionism because the existence of Israel is a part of Revelations and the End Times prophecy. Many American Jews also strongly identify with Zionism out of a desire to have an ancestral ethnic homeland, even if they do not hold dual citizenship with Israel.</p>

<p>3) Morally speaking, I feel like most Americans would agree there&#39;s a human rights justification for supporting Israel, notably as a reparation for the ethnic cleansing they faced in the holocaust and a duty to protect a minority Jewish population from the often-hostile Muslim majority that surrounds their borders. </p>

<p>4) Militarily, Israel&#39;s need to fend off attacks from nearby hostile states and political groups represents a pretty large market for the newest, most expensive, and most profitable military equipment. American defense contractors and the politicians who count those defense contractors among their constituency would not want to lose Israel as a strong market for weapons, so pandering to Israel has potentially large correlations to revenue.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I don&#39;t put much stock in the angle that Wall Street and the Media are controlled by a secret cabal of Zionists, though I suppose there are likely just as many Zionists there as anywhere, and definitely a lot of moneyed interest and influence, so there will be some notable overlap. </p>

<p>Id also like to point out the moral case in (3) resonates much less with today&#39;s American youth - the horrors of WW2 are a distant piece of history, Israel seems perfectly capable of defending itself without us, and the plight of the occupied Palestinian territory and their struggle for independent democratic statehood makes Israel look like a hypocritical anti-democratic bully instead of the much bullied champion of democracy they claim to be.</p>

Other Christian neighbors &amp; friends have told me their ardent support of Israel is because their end time views involve that nation.

<p>Of course, my anecdotes are not proof of anything.  However, enough Christian politicians trek over to Jerusalem for photo-ops that maybe the reporters following along should ask how their rapturous views of Israel are influencing their foreign policies.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel plays a huge part in Biblical end times, which is literally playing out in front of us.  In a nut shell, and I&#39;m no Bible scholar, Israel will be left to stand against her enemies (read Islam whose DOCTRINE is to kill Jewish people), and the people will call out to God to save them and Jesus will return and defend Israel Himself.  It&#39;s also prophesied that whoever turns their back on Israel, or deals with her treacherously, will have to answer to God.  The conflict is more spiritual than anything else.  !!!This is an answer to OPs question, I&#39;m not trying to start an argument either, nor do I want to argue islam&#39;s doctrine,  the existence of God, or the accuracy of the Bible!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do get frustrated that Christian folk in the US seem to worship Israel as a manifestation of the likeness of Jesus Himself. In reality, all throughout the Bible, God constantly condemns Israel for turning from God, allowing its enemies to rule over Israel when it is especially far from God. Obviously God never gives up on Israel, but allows them wallow in the free choice of sin like any other sinner. I see current times as no different, Israel, for the most part, does not hold the Christian Messiah as authoritative and certainly does not turn to God alone, given that the land is becoming more secular by the hour. Much like the united states. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.  I think, though, that when her allies leave Israel to defend herself, the common thought is that the remnant who believe will cry out to God, and He&#39;ll hear them.  Then the you have the two witnesses who show up and preach repentance and Jesus to them.  And wow, there are some arguments about who those two are too lol! However, God made some promises to Abraham, Jacob and Isaac and God has said for His own name&#39;s sake, He&#39;ll save His own.

The two witnesses can be found in the Book of Revelation chapter 11.  They will proclaim their testimony and witness to Israel (and the world). They will have the ability to keep it from raining, turn water to blood, and generally be all Biblical with the plagues and unkillable until they have fulfilled what they were assigned to do.  Then their dead bodies will lay in the street for 3.5 days and all the world will celebrate like it&#39;s christmas because these two get all judgy on them and no one likes it. Then the two will stand up, come alive again and ascend into heaven when God calls them.  The argument is who are these two.  Is it Moses and Enoch; Moses and Elijah; Moses (old testament) and Paul (new testament), James and John (Sons of Thunder); two random believers; the old testament and new testament itself; did it already happen during the French revolution?  Etc. Quite the debate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent question. The religions that don&#39;t have an answer to this simply cannot be true. How is it fair that everyone who lived before Judaism and the Torah simply goes to hell?</p>

<p>Islam explains this as being that in total there were 144,000 prophets sent to mankind in total. </p>

<p>Among them include Adam, Lot, Abraham,Moses, Joseph, Jesus etc and finally Muhammad (peace be upon them all).</p>

<p>However, there is not much use for us to know every single Prophet, so only 25 are mentioned in the Quran. But Allaah states that every nation and community was sent a messenger.</p>

<p>So every single civilisation preceding Judaism etc, was sent a Prophet. However they have all changed their message. But we do not know who these prophets were.</p>

<p>It could be that ancient Sumerians, the Mayans etc all had prophets sent to them, but over time then people changed the message and it devolved into the things we knew them to believe in last.</p>

<p>The final Prophet was sent to the whole of humanity.</p>

<p>Muhammad peace be upon him.</p>

Christian folk seem to assume Christ was the Jewish messiah that they had been waiting for on earth when in actuality he wasn&#39;t. They denied him.

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps you are confusing currencies with the production of money. I think of currency as printed paper money. As you said that might represent 1/ 100th of money that exists as electronic credits.</p>

<p>The enormous numbers you gave for derivative scandals, must have been of notional values. The actual monetary values of the underlying contracts must have self canceled or they would have blown the world&#39;s banking systems sky high.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying, the problem is far beyond the scope of just &quot;the Jews&quot;.  Plus I doubt many of these powerful Zionist Jews even practice Judaism at all, they&#39;re probably kabbalists and secret society members if anything.</p>

<p>Just my opinions.</p>
