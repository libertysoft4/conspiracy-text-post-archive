        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I purchased a Toshiba Portege R205 from an Ebay seller. I needed an ultraportable laptop pre2008 as explained in:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/2cu80z/former_m15_officer_and_whistleblower_warns/">http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/2cu80z/former_m15_officer_and_whistleblower_warns/</a></p>

<p>I commuted 11 hours to Sarasota, Florida to personally pick up the laptop. Prior computers I purchased from Ebay and retailers were indicted, implanted and infected. See <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/2a24sh/removing_bulldozer_implant_from_my_laptops/">http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/2a24sh/removing_bulldozer_implant_from_my_laptops/</a></p>

<p>That night, I disassembled, air gapped, reassembled my laptop. I glued four screws on the back to attempt to prevent it from being disassembled and implanted. That night, hackers broke into my hotel room while I was sleeping. They drilled out the glued screws, implanted, physically damaged the keyboard and infected. </p>

<p>On Reddit, I requested volunteers to conduct forensics. A Redditor recommended joining a mailing list. I posted my request. Someone graciously volunteered to conduct forensics. On Saturday, July 19, 2014, I dropped off my Toshiba, along with an interdicted and tampered Fedora CD, infected flashdrive and an infected raspberry pi to a FedEx authorized reseller in downtown Sarasota. Description of Fedora is at

<p>FedEx&#39;s policy is not to notify the shipper and the recipient of the redirection.</p>

<p>I asked Michael how recipients are allowed to change the address without the consent or knowledge of the shipper. I explained that when I was the recipient and wanted to change the address, FedEx instructed me to ask the shipper to change the address. Michael explained that I had not placed restrictions on my account to prevent the shipping address from being redirected. Michael instructed me to ask the Revenue Department to do so. </p>

<p>I asked an employee for the number of the Revenue Department. Employee refused to look up the number and misrepresented the Revenue Department did not have a direct phone number. Instead, the employee transferred me.</p>

<p>The Revenue Department employee did not know their direct phone number. I hung up. I called back 800-463-3339 and again asked for the Revenue Department&#39;s telephone number. I was finally given 800-622-1147.</p>

<p>I asked an employee in the Revenue Department to transfer me to a supervisor. However, I was transferred to Bobby in Customers Relations. I asked Bobby to transfer me to a supervisor in the Revenue Department. Bobby misrepresented that she is a supervisor in the Revenue Department. I asked Bobbie for her contact information in the event that I needed to contact her again. Bobbie misrepresented her contact information is BRIFTOC. Bobby failed to give her ID number.</p>

<p>I asked Bobby why I was not offered restriction options when I set up my account. Nor was I notified of restrictions options there after until today. Bobby did not give an answer. I asked Bobby to place restrictions on my account prohibiting redirecting the shipping address without my knowledge and consent.</p>

<p>I asked Bobby to escalate my complaint. Bobby wanted me to write a letter to FedEx. There is no point spending the time and money on my prepaid phone to call Fedex, if I have to write a letter, print it out and mail it. I insisted Bobby write up a complaint. Bobby did not give me a case number. I asked Bobby to email or fax the complaint to me. Bobby said she could not email or fax. </p>

<p>Interdiction #2:</p>

<p>Michael informed me that morning the package was being returned to me because the recipient had not picked it up at the FedEx location in Beaverton, Oregon. </p>

<p>The timing was very suspicious. Since I am being hacked in real time, the hackers knew that I logged into my FedEx account. FedEx holds packages for pick up for five business days. Yet, FedEx held the package much longer. All of a sudden, FedEx is returning it to shipper. I had departed Sarasota, FL. Returning it to Sarasota, FL would have placed the package at risk.</p>

<p>FedEx should notify shippers and recipients before packages are being returned to shipper.</p>

<p>Michael promised to have the package delivered to the initial address. Michael left a voicemail confirming that the package was being redirected to the initial address.</p>

<p>Interdiction #3:</p>

<p>I did not know the recipient&#39;s phone number so I gave my phone number on the ground shipping label. On August 5, 2014, I received an automated voicemail that the package will be delivered tomorrow, that a signature is required and a recommendation to chose the option hold for pick up.  </p>

<p>I had not requested a signature. Nor did the tracking information display that a signature was required. A signature requirement can be used as an alibi to return a package to the shipper if the recipient is not home and does not make arrangements to sign for the package.</p>

<p>I tried to reach Bobby but Carolyn ID 921550 did not even try to transfer me to Bobby. Customer Relations&#39; direct telephone number should be given to customers. Supervisors should be able to give out extension numbers.</p>

<p>Instead Carolyn transferred me to a female employee in El Paso.  It took her a while to read the notes on my account to find out who Bobby is. Bobby had left for the day. I asked to speak to a supervisor. She told me supervisors left for the day. I asked what the supervisors&#39; hours are. She refused to tell me. She told me a signature was not required.</p>

<p>Interdiction #4:</p>

<p>She informed me the package was being returned to FedEx Office in Beaverton, Oregon.</p>

<p>Again, I asked to speak to a supervisor. She transferred me to Carlos ID 892831. Carlos confirmed that signature was not required and that package was being returned to FedEx Office in Beaverton, Oregon. Carlos could not explain why the package was redirected again to FedEx Office. I asked how the redirections were being requested. Carlos explained the recipient went on FedEx&#39;s website. I argued that the recipient had not requested redirections. Carlos argued no 
one else would know the tracking number and recipient&#39;s contact information. I requested an investigation on the identity of the person performing the redirections. </p>

<p>I asked Carlos how the shipment was again redirected without my knowledge or consent. I explained to Carlos that Bobby had placed restrictions on my account prohibiting redirection. Carlos explained that Bobby does not place restrictions on accounts. That Bobby could only forward my request for restrictions.</p>

<p>I should never have been transferred to Bobby. when I argued with Bobby that she was not the appropriate employee to be transferred to, Bobby should have transferred me to an employee who can place restrictions. I complained to Carlos that shippers and recipients should be notified when shipments are redirected.</p>

<p>The next day, August 6, 2014, I received email notification that the package was delivered to FedEx Office in Beaverton, OR. I asked to speak to Bobbie, Michael and Carlos. They were not available. An employee told me the package was delivered to the initial address.</p>

<p>Was it? I emailed the recipient and am waiting for his reply. </p>

<p>FedEx should have a fax number or an email address to forward complaints to. Instead, FedEx merely offers an email form to fill out. The form has size restrictions. I could not copy and paste this complaint into its form. On August 6, 2014, I mailed a complaint requesting FedEx to email or fax their investigation, confirmation that restrictions has been placed on my account and to waive the shipping fee. To date, FedEx has not responded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What type of information do you have that would interest hackers to go through such great lengths? </p>

<p>Edit: just read some of the linked posts you had. I would doubt someone going that far would be so bad at repacking it. I recall the snowden leaks talking about how they could mimic most things to cover their tracks. Someone is going to go through all that trouble of getting your computer, but mess up the box or tape in some way?</p>

<p>I worked at a UPS 10 years ago and saw every type of damage happen to a box and it needing to be re-taped or repackaged. </p>

<p>Not saying this is all a lie, but what would be the benefit to target you? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An ex-defendant hired private investigators who hired NSA trained hackers. During litigation, the type of information plaintiffs have that would interest hackers would be relevant to the litigation. Hackers harass plaintiffs. Hackers make it difficult for plaintiffs to continue working on litigation using their computers and smartphones. Goal is to force plaintiffs to dismiss or settle for a paltry settlement.</p>

<p>Post litigation, the type of information that would interest hackers would be any data that would set aside a judgment and personally identifiable information that would enable hackers and private investigators to continue to surveil and harass ex-plaintiffs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t make a police report on the hotel break in.</p>

<p>In the past, I have made several reports to the police that my Honda Accord, Chevrolet Suburban, Avion RVs, storage units and suitcases were broken into. Since I had a witness that my Chevrolet Suburban was broken into, the police took a report. They did not follow up.</p>

<p>In two separate incidents, an officer refused to take a report that my car was broken into because there was no evidence of forced entry. I replied that slim jims are sold on the internet and do not leave evidence of forced entry.</p>

<p>Police took a report that my suitcase was broken into. Police didn&#39;t follow up. Another incident, police refused to take a report. In another incident, police refused to take a report that my suitcase was stolen because they were not present to witness the theft.</p>

<p>An officer refused to take a report that the padlock on one of my storage units had been picked because there was no evidence of forced entry. So I drove to the police station and insisted that a report be taken. A report was taken. Police did not follow up.</p>

<p>My laptops, external hard drives, flashdrives and USB network adapters were stored inside briefcases or suitcases locked with a padlock inside my vehicle and storage unit. Hackers broke into my car and picked the padlock on my storage unit, briefcase and suitcases, disassembled my laptops, implanted and infected them, copied my external hard drives and flashdrives and infected them.</p>

<p>My mother was a plaintiff in an action against the same defendant and a plaintiff in an action against the same cross-defendant. Henchmen hired by private investigators repeatedly broke into my parents&#39; home. Police didn&#39;t help. My parents paid several thousand dollars for an alarm system. They tampered with the alarm system. They repeatedly broken in again. Police didn&#39;t help. </p>

<p>Hackers infected my mother&#39;s computers. We reinfected each other&#39;s computers and were cyberstalked by emailing each other.</p>

<p>You can verify this thread by asking FedEx if they allow:</p>

<p>(1) anyone who has gained knowledge of a tracking number and recipient&#39;s contact information to redirect shipping unless an account has restrictions;</p>

<p>(2) Account holders are not advised of the restrictions that are available to chose from;</p>

<p>(3) don&#39;t notify the shipper and recipient of redirection; and</p>

<p>(4) don&#39;t notify the shipper and recipient before a package is returned to sender.</p>

<p>Shipping my interdicted, implanted and infected computers and linux CD IS seeking help through security people. The volunteer who offered to conduct forensics is a computer security specialist.</p>

<p>Very difficult to find computer forensic experts even if willing to pay them. Where do they advertise? Where do customers advertise for them? How to verify their knowledge and expertise? Colleges don&#39;t teach forensics. That&#39;s why the NSA sponsored hacking programs at several colleges.

<p>Forensics may find the computer is tampered but most likely won&#39;t be able to identify the hacker who tampered with the computer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;le tricksy rusester&#39; was just a joke, implying you are making this story up for personal enjoyment. (I dont really believe this).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to start making international calls to fed ex to verify your claims, sorry man.</p>

<p>Have you reached out to Dragos over twitter/g+/fb? I&#39;m not even sure if he &#39;believes&#39; in badbios anymore, but at least if he does and if you are actually compromised you could correlate data and look for consistent patterns. </p>

<p>Failing that, and without wanting to judge - or be mean or anything, I suggest taking a two week holiday from the digital world, just to make sure you aren&#39;t just having a blip. Fuck it, I&#39;ve had them man and there&#39;s no shame in it. Sooner you can confirm the sooner you can proceed, but clearly posting your woes on reddit aren&#39;t getting much results.</p>

<p>All the best man. I wish you well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I joined twitter specifically to follow Dragos and Jacob Appelbaum who&#39;s smartphone&#39;s ultrasound infected Dragos&#39; computers. </p>

<p><a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/247bva/tor_developers_smartphone_transmits_badbios/">https://pay.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/247bva/tor_developers_smartphone_transmits_badbios/</a></p>

<p>Dragos ceased discussing BadBIOS. Not because he doesn&#39;t believe BadBIOS exists, but because he was ridiculed. His professional reputation was at stake. I am not in the computer field, so my reputation does not impact on a career. </p>

<p>Jacob Appelbaum tweets very little on BadBIOS. I rarely log into my twitter account.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m fairly sure Jacob&#39;s comment on BadBios was in jest. It was a throwaway line he mentioned during 30c3. Watch it if you like for context.</p>

<p>I must say as a keen observer of that scene, that BadBios looked far more like rumour and hysteria than a genuine massive 0-day and paradigm-shifting new PoE would present itself.</p>

<p>Security researchers would tear off their left nut to have the opportunity to reverse engineer something like that.</p>

<p>As I say though, just an amateur and an observer.</p>

<p>Obviously not asking for disclosure, but ask yourself why would you be a target of TAO for all these months despite your open disclosure online?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Taking screenshots is a good idea. I didn&#39;t. Though the tracking information does show almost all of the above. I didn&#39;t cite the tracking number in my thread because that would disclose the recipient&#39;s and my contact information. I do not have permission from the recipient to do so.</p>
