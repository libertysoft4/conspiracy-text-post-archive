    <div class="md"><p>Because the military oh I mean the police locked down their town and wouldn&#39;t let them near the police station. They burn down the gas station because what else can they do? They are angry. One protester described the mentality of burning it down like this. Paraphrasing. &quot;We burnt it down because revenue through business taxes tickets keeps the machine of oppression running, and the only way to hurt that system is by disrupting the money.&quot; Of course burning one business down will not change anything, but it shows that these people feel like they really have no options and they rightly feel like there will be no justice done in the end because there usually isnt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe they are purposely televising to help foment this animosity between police and the general public. </p>

<p>If the police side with the general public when civil unrest occurs, the elites will be the ones people go after.  By keeping this animosity built up the police will see the general public as deserving of the brutality that will be necessary to stop a multi-city public sector breakdown, riots, etc. </p>

<p>It seems to me the military is getting wise to their actions and the distrust has been seeded amongst a lot of them.  The personality of most individuals going into the army is to protect the nation&#39;s freedom.  They will have a hard time being called to shoot on their own, in the event it occurs.  I believe they know this.  There are exceptions of course, but it will be harder.   </p>

<p>The police on the other hand tend (mostly, there are exceptions) to have a great deal of animosity towards the general public, personality wise they are roided up and fed this US vs. THEM mentality.  </p>

<p>The problem is:  The police will bail, just like they did at Katrina when faced with widescale collapse, they will fall back to protect their families and others.  </p>

<p>Once the police realize their pensions are at risk, and they are, or that they are horribly outnumbered when we are fed-up enough to go to the streets.  </p>

<p>This is what I see from my perspective.  Why else would the media be hyping up all this police brutality, civilian shootings of police officers and other misconduct.  There is always and angle.  Otherwise they wouldn&#39;t be showing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. I agree with you 100%. When anything in this country gets as much publicity on mainstream news outlets we should ask ourselves what their agenda is in allowing that to happen. Furthering racial tensions, furthering US v. THEM mentality w/ police forces, etc. Whatever their intentions are, they are nestled in their deeply. They don&#39;t just let things happen... they make what they want happen. </p>

<p>I guess my point is that just because a conspiracy to command and control society exists, doesn&#39;t mean that every event is the result of direction or control of the conspirators.

<p>rioting/looting is very ol&#39;school AND wrong; however consider the frustration; guess no one here was <em>even</em> born during the riots of the 70&#39;s, the city of Detroit was devastated - burnt. to. the. ground, innocent ppl died too,</p>

<p>maybe they&#39;re trying to START a race war or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While this was a unfortunate incident with the murder of the man the way some of the citizens are reacting is absurd. This should not prompt people into rioting gas stations and stealing products. They&#39;re displaying actions in the same way of the cop when it comes to the term of taking something that is not yours. I&#39;m fine seeing the protests however but the looting needs to end. </p>
