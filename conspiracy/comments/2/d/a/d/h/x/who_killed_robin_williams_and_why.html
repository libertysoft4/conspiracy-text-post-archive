    <div class="md"><p>It is ALWAYS called an apparent suicide before a coroner confirmation.  </p>

<p>My best friend&#39;s foster family found her hanging in her closet and it was called an &quot;apparent suicide.&quot;</p>

<p>A friend of mine found her father dead in their basement with his gun near him and it was &quot;apparent suicide.&quot;</p>

<p>Both of these people were very depressed, and they were legitimate suicides.  But they&#39;re always apparent until the coroner confirms, as to avoid spreading WRONG information to friends and family.  So they say &quot;this is what it looks like to us - but we need to have professionals make the final call and confirm.</p>

<p>Jeez you people just want <em>everything</em> to be a conspiracy, and will ignore logic to reason it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This &quot;everything is a distraction&quot; mentality is ridiculous. Robin Williams died. How could the government &#39;distract&#39; us with that? You read an article on his death, feel sad, and within the hour, you&#39;re back doing what you were doing before, because most people have things to do. The news channels aren&#39;t going to run this story 24/7/365. And everyone who finds out about his death isn&#39;t going to go, &quot;Oh my god, I&#39;m sooo distracted! I&#39;ll never think about Gaza or Ukraine or ISIS again!&quot; Yeah, a lot of people are going to be sad and mope because they really like Robin Williams, but the whole country, 300,000,000 people, are not going to be &#39;distracted&#39; from the global geopolitical scene by his death for any length of time.</p>

<p>There&#39;s this thing called the human mind. It&#39;s a complex thing. It&#39;s capable of making the human body do this sorcery called, &#39;Do one thing. Finish doing it. Then do another thing.&#39; After reading an article about Williams or Bieber or some entertainment/celebrity news, you&#39;re able to then open another internet tab and type into the search box, &#39;Gaza invasion&#39;, &#39;Ukraine crisis&#39;, &#39;ISIS threatening genocide&#39;.</p>

<p>And in the news, they alot different times to talking about different stories. Just because they&#39;re not blasting one story all the time, doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re &#39;suppressing&#39; it. They&#39;re going to talk about Robin Williams&#39; death for fifteen minutes a day and what will they talk about for the other 1,425 minutes? Other news.</p>

<p>This is really a big problem. So many critics of main stream media pride themselves on never watching it, and then complain that the MSM isn&#39;t talking about an important story. If you never watch it, how do you know what they are and aren&#39;t talking about?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These events often have personal echoes. My grandmother died after falling from window and it was ruled suicide by the coroner. </p>

<p>The truth is that for the authorities, suicide is often the most &quot;convenient&quot; cause of death - no time-consuming and expensive police enquiry, no insurance claims, no &quot;loose ends&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely.  And we had suspicions with my best friend that she was either abused heavily by her foster parents, driving her to suicide, or killed by them directly and had her death staged as a self-hanging. Who would suspect a troubled teen to be murdered by foster parents?  The bruises that covered her body at her funeral were quite suspicious though.</p>

<p>Which is really why I hope he wrote notes.  Authorities do tend to take the path of least resistance.  The eternal wondering and what ifs can almost drive loved ones to insanity.</p>

<p>Generally though, if you&#39;re asphyxiated in your own home and have a history of mental illness, it&#39;s probably suicide. Falling out of a window is one thing.  You can&#39;t accidentally fall into a noose.</p>
