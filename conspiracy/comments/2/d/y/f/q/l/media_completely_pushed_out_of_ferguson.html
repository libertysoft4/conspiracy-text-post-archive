    <div class="md"><p>I believe that the way the media has been treated in Ferguson has nothing to do with the police trying to hide their activities. There has been a massive outcry across the country about the violation of the 1st Amendment and freedom of the press in Ferguson. One would think that play #1 in the public relations handbook would be to leave the media alone, allow them to report, and be as transparent as possible. But the opposite has happened; they have been increasingly harsh with media. Even more tellingly, they have since allowed themselves to be filmed being openly hostile to reporters (gassing Al Jazeera, &quot;Turn that off or I&#39;ll shoot you in the face!&quot;) It&#39;s a mistake to chalk this up to a bunch of dumb, rogue cops with too many toys. We&#39;re over a week into the standoff, and it has the attention of all levels of law enforcement, the Governor, and the international media. There is a plan; there is a strategy. This tells me they don&#39;t give a fuck that people are angry. <em>They are sending a message</em>. They aren&#39;t trying to hide their activities. They <em>want</em> the people to know that the police are militarized. They <em>want</em> people to know they will use force to stifle dissent, peaceful or not. They <em>want</em> people to know they will be arrested without cause. They are trying to tell you that <em>you do not have the right to question their authority, including but not limited to your Constitutional rights.</em> They have spent 13 years building the legal framework by which they can launch an assault on the people&#39;s rights; Ferguson is merely the stage on which they have chosen to finally show their hand.</p>

<p>When it spreads, it&#39;s going to usher in a new era of policing tactic. There is going to be a general order to stop the people, anyway they feel necessary. More death will result in more protestors. More protestors will result in more death. </p>

<p>Eventually it will interfere with &quot;business as usual&quot; because it may prevent people from getting to/from work.  Or create many checkpoints you must drive through just to do our jobs.  Kinda like nazi Germany.  Just like it actually.  With too much fear people cannot keep the wheels turning that keep the corporations making profits.  The police will eventually be in conflict with their corporate bosses I would think, so they&#39;ll have to give some concession at some point.</p>

<p>I find it funny that this town has gone ballistic over an unarmed teen being gunned down, but when as many as 10 cops helped kill Kelly Thomas. </p>

<p>Just seems like people are concerned over the wrong thing here. They seem more upset at this one event instead of trying to fix the system. Focusing on on the issues surrounding this particular situation instead of the real problem.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for civil disobedience, but this just seems more about revenge than justice.</p>

<p>Just watch the streams, listen to police scanner or read twitter. Multiple people have been shot (by rioters, not cops), one was critically shot over the weekend and I heard died at the hospital (but you won&#39;t see a follow up story in the media on that)</p>

<p>edit: they are doing a press conference right now, Ron Johnson talked for a minute or so about all the reports of shots fired tonight alone, and how they had to extract a gunshot victim, and how his police were in several situations where they were under heavy fire. It&#39;s been like this all week - look at the live thread in <a href="/r/stlouis">/r/stlouis</a>. Reports of shots fired like every 5 minutes when the situations get tense.</p>

<p>No, the difference is a lot simpler than that. Blacks riot and loot -- whites don&#39;t. There are a handful of exceptions in each incident, but overwhelmingly this is the truth. Why do blacks riot and loot? I don&#39;t know. If I had to guess, I&#39;d say it was probably because blacks have less respect for the law than whites, are more emotionally unstable and more impulsive, and are more prone to violent bahavior than whites. We can debate about why blacks riot, but the facts show that they do riot. Just look at news footage of any riot in America that involved looting in the past few decades. How many white faces do you see, and how many black faces. It&#39;s not open to debate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I may be biased due to my research on the Waco incident, but I don&#39;t feel like we can compare them to this New Black Panther Party. </p>

<p>Inciting violence for the sake of violence doesn&#39;t accomplish anything. All this does is push away people that want to help and force those in charge to take more drastic actions. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s take this and flip it. Let&#39;s say a white teenager had been the victim and a black cop had shot him. Would the black community be as engaged? We all know the police wouldn&#39;t be doing anything different, as they have proven time and time again that the citizens they are hired to serve don&#39;t mean anything to them.</p>

<p>Would there have been riots?</p>

<p>Would Al Sharpton be giving his thoughts on violence?</p>

<p>Would it have even made the news that night outside of St. Louis?</p>

<p>Probably not. But because it was a white cop shooting a black teenager, suddenly the community feels it&#39;s OK to riot and loot and start fires?</p>

<p>In not saying the shooting of a black teenager is any less of a tragedy than the shooting of a white teenager, they are both equally traffic. But given the communities response, the total lack of police presence during the looting but their need to assault reporters and people from the media, and the fact that this isn&#39;t spreading makes it feel like this is just a big staged event, put into motion by those that stand to gain from the failure of the police and the destruction of these neighborhoods.</p>

<p>So, the only question left is who stands to gain anything from all of this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason this is a problem is because when you have a &quot;community leader&quot; as Sharpton is branded giving a &quot;wink and nod&quot; endorsement to perpetuating violence you will get violence.  These people aren&#39;t helping their cause.  They are keeping businesses in their own community from making money/robbing and setting fire to their own community.  We don&#39;t even have all the facts out to what happened here yet.  It&#39;s a bad idea to loot your own community so that there will be less jobs in your community in the future.  What business man will try to set up shop in an area that has a history of looting?  It works against the cause.  It only helps the people like Al Sharpton to have a lucrative business of calling out &quot;racism&quot; because in 10 years when people in Ferguson are even worse off than they are now he can say &quot;whitey did this too!&quot;</p>

<p>If we let business go on as usual with these cops, we&#39;ll never learn the facts. We&#39;ve seen time and time again that if left to police (hah) themselves, law enforcement will bend the rules in any way they can in order to protect their own.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with that and I think there are a lot of police officers who are way to overzealous and police brutality exists to a level that will never be exposed by the media.  All police officers should wear a camera on their lapel as some states already require.  The point I&#39;m trying to make, however, is that burning down your own neighborhood because you are mad about the police will not help anything.  This is an attempt to create a race war.  This is the same shit that happened after the Trayvon Martin shooting.  The Media ran with a story that was wrong but enough people saw that and got fired up about it.  People need to wait for the information before they decide what happened.  I blame the media more than anyone.  </p>

<p>&quot;First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Socialist.</p>

<p>Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.</p>

Because I was not a Jew.</p>
