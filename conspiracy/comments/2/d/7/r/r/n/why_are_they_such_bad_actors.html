<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAoKDjDKap0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAoKDjDKap0</a></p>

<p>...and...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-mO_h1_tms">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-mO_h1_tms</a></p>

<p>To understand this choice in acting, you need to first understand that these operations have a multipurpose, but for now we will consider one of the main purposes, which is to take away our guns.</p>

<p>All they really need is someone to claim to be a parent of a person that was murdered with a gun, have a backing of a community, and they can propose to congress a new bill that will limit your ability to purchase and/or own a firearm and/or ammunition.  The powers that couldn&#39;t care less if YOU, the citizen, see through their charade, because of two factors; you&#39;re not in congress, and you&#39;re an adult.</p>

<p>They know fully well that they can&#39;t fully take away your guns, but they sure as Hell can start rolling that ball by chipping away at it.  They know if they tried to take thee gun now, there would be a riot, because almost all of us have been conditioned to never allow that.</p>

<p>But your kids haven&#39;t.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve been conditioning your kids to HATE guns.  Why do you think their expelling kids just for drawing a gun?  Why do you think all these shootings are happening in places frequented by kids; schools, movie theaters, malls, etc.?</p>

<p>As for the acting, take a moment and compare the acting styles to that done on children&#39;s shows.  They want to show the children tragedy, but they don&#39;t want it so bad that they won&#39;t watch.  It&#39;s a style of acting that&#39;s specifically designed for children.  Here&#39;s a clip from an article that explains it...</p>

<p><a href="http://broadwaymouth.blogspot.com/2009/04/four-top-ten-acting-techniques-that.html">http://broadwaymouth.blogspot.com/2009/04/four-top-ten-acting-techniques-that.html</a></p>

<p>&quot;1. overly caricatured acting— I once had a former student who majored in theatre in college (why, I’ll never know; she only once participated in high school shows), but she dropped out because she said “the acting was so fakey.”</p>

<p>The stage will always be an acting medium that requires a larger-then-life performance because, as Carol Channing has said, you can’t perform in a 1000+ seat theatre and be normal. However, technology has allowed a change in acting style from the Golden Era which still has some remnants in professional theatre.</p>

<p>A performance can be stage-fitting without being “fakey.” The stage doesn’t allow for actions/mugging in place of genuine emotional expression. I’m specifically referencing grand expressions that communicate the subtext of “I’m acting on a stage!!!!” instead of “I’m devastated” or “How exciting.” This isn’t just a thought aimed at high school directors; this overly caricatured style still finds its way onto professional stages.</p>

<p>Yes, you need a certain amount of caricature for most types of humor (on stage or off), but there’s caricature still in touch with reality and that which is completely disconnected. The completely disconnected must be, well, completely disconnected for good. &quot;</p>

<p>Do you see yet?  You&#39;re not going to give up your guns.  They know this.</p>

<p>But your kids will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just as in 1984 where it talked about the parents fearing their children. Here</p>

<p>Nearly all children nowadays were horrible. What was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as the Spies they were systematically turned into ungovernable little savages, and yet this produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the discipline of the Party. On the contrary, they adored the Party and everything connected with it. The songs, the processions, the banners, the hiking, the drilling with dummy rifles, the yelling of slogans, the worship of Big Brother—it was all a sort of glorious game to them. All their ferocity was turned outwards, against the enemies of the State, against foreigners, traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals. It was almost normal for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children. And with good reason, for hardly a week passed in which ‘The Times’ did not carry a paragraph describing how some eavesdropping little sneak—’child hero’ was the phrase generally used—had overheard some compromising remark and denounced its parents to the Thought Police.</p>

<p>Consider this; why don&#39;t you (an adult) enjoy watching most shows meant for children?  Well, first it would be a bit creepy, sure, but actually the biggest reason is because you consider the acting in such shows to be of low-quality.</p>

<p>What most aren&#39;t aware of, is this type of acting that most adults consider to be of low-quality, is actually done on purpose, because it allows optimum acceptance from their target audience; children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I applaud you Futz! Many people I know try and give the ole Occam&#39;s Razor buttering, I think it is one of those doublespeak things Orwell tried to warn us about. When the answer is simple God is answering, the Devil is in the details. This is not me Bible thumpering but just an honest assessment of good and evil as I see it today. The reason lawyers draw up contracts, decipher the law and create them (most politicians are) is due to they are the only ones who can read it&#39;s double forked tonguery. The veil is thinning out daily and more and more people are waking up. I have noticed that the only ones still asleep are the children (mentally) even if they are in grown-up bodies. So kudos to you and keep spreading the knowledge we shall overcome!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>parents of Sandy Hook students or bombing victims. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>actors playing roles.</p>

<p>Jonathan Reich was arrested for &#39;harassing&#39; the parents charity for one of
faked dead kids, the charity in question for the kid, and the MSM were using Lily Gaubet&#39;s picture, for three weeks or so.</p>

<p>the kid&#39;s own parents did not know they were using a fake picture for their kid.</p>

<p>it took Lily Gaubet&#39;s mother raising hell to get them to remove her daughters picture and put up some other picture.</p>

<p>this beggars belief, considering the charities were supposed to have been setup by the parents themselves.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hrGgAFAOow">Allison Wyatt, supposedly shot at Sandy Hook, was exposed as Lily by her mother, Cathy Gaubert.</a></p>

<p>the Daily Mail, the UK conduit of the CIA&#39;s intelligence.</p>

<p>and here the how and why of lily Gaubet. SIPA Press of France, French language photo archive site, they thought using a non english speaking website would be secure.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcfLc0SK0OM">the catalog of wire photos published by AP and other news sources, that predate the events of the Sandy Hook Shooting.</a></p>

<p>the victim photos are dated June or November 2012, thats when they collected together the resources for the Sandy Hoax.</p>

<p>even the Lt. Vance press conference was staged before the event, and this means ALL the MSM that covered Sandy Hoax were in on the hoax. they know that it is a fake event.</p>

<p>ABC with their faked planter (a bad copy of the real one at the firehouse) in a studio for the fake grieving parents video and photos.</p>

<p>MSM = liars for money.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Features">Rex Features</a> as noted on the SIPA website, they seemed to be the organizers of the photos for the hoax.</p>

<p>this <a href="http://www.mediamoves.com/2009/12/america-teve-names-head-of-entertainment-division.html">dude</a> the Florida and SIPA connection, is he in any photos at the firehouse or its aftermath, likely and would be THE smoking gun. ditto too one of the lucky photographers at SH also had a Florida connection</p>

<p>a lot of the crisis actors were from Florida too.</p>
