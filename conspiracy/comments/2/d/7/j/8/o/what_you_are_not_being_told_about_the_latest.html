<p>Obama says he is going to start (restart) airstrikes in Iraq and drop &quot;humanitarian&quot; aid because Iraq has become a &quot;catastrophe&quot;.</p>

<p>In order to understand what is currently going on in Iraq we first have to understand some of the background, history and the more recent events over the last year or so.
It&#39;s getting pretty complicated - so please bear with me while I try and explain.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Maliki</p>

<p>Maliki has now fallen out of favor with Washington DC because he has got too close to Iran.
Obama and the State Department want him replaced with someone else (I don&#39;t know who yet).</p>

<p>Maliki signed a deal with Iran and Assad in July 2013 to build a gas pipeline from Iran&#39;s South Pars gas field (the largest in the world) to the coast of Syria, for onward export to Europe.
This was the real reason for the sudden escalation in the attempts by the US government to get overtly involved in the Syrian civil war, in late August and September 2013; and to start a massive bombing campaign in Syria.
The chemical weapons attack in Damascus in August 2013, that was immediately blamed on Assad, was actually a false flag attack by Islamic Extremist rebels on rebels in Damascus and was probably engineered and schemed via Turkey.
See 1, information on the Syrian civil war.</p>

<p>Maliki has recently become even more friendlier with Putin and Russia.
There were already some deals for Russia to start drilling for oil in Iraq, from a year or more ago.
In the last couple of months it has been announced that Russia has started producing oil in Iraq and that Russia and Iraq were looking to expand Russia&#39;s involvement in developing Iraq&#39;s oil assets. See 2.</p>

<p>Maliki became frustrated with the US&#39;s refusal to supply any of the previously agreed 36 F-16&#39;s (or to supply weapons in general), so he has obtained jets from Russia instead. See 2.
Iran also returned the ~80 Iraqi planes that were sent to Iran in 1991 during the first Gulf War to prevent the US destroying them. These will now be very old.</p>

<p>Maliki&#39;s Shia led government has always been favorable to Iran&#39;s Shia&#39;s.
Hence the calls from DC that Maliki must form a more &quot;inclusive&quot; government with Sunnis (this is just code to move away from Iran).</p>

<p>Maliki fired his Kurdish Foreign Minister in July - see 3.</p>

<p>The Kurds in Iraq</p>

<p>Obama has refused to arm the Kurds in their current fight against ISIS.
The Kurds have urgently requested resupplies of ammunition etc. which Obama has so far refused to do. It is not yet known whether Obama&#39;s &quot;humanitarian&quot; airdrops are cover to supply munitions and weapons to the Kurds or if the Kurds are still out of favor - see below.</p>

<p>The Kurds have recently fallen out of favor with both Washington DC and Maliki because they have recently started selling their own oil for their own revenue, bypassing any involvement of Maliki and Baghdad.
If the Kurds can sell their own oil without the involvement of Baghdad&#39;s Oil Ministry, they will have the necessary revenue to declare complete independence from Baghdad.</p>

<p>The Kurds are selling their oil in a joint operation with Erdogan and Turkey. Oil tankers are being loaded with Kurdish oil in Turkey and then sold on the open market.
There is an ongoing US court case concerning an attempted delivery of Kurdish oil to the US. See 3. </p>

<p>The Oil Tanker in question which has $100m worth of oil on board.</p>

<p>This is only one of 5 tankers that have been loaded with Kurdish oil in the Turkish port of Ceyhan since May. I do not know how the Kurdish oil is getting from the Kurdish oil fields in Iraq, to Ceyhan in Turkey.
The oil tankers have and are delivering oil to various locations around the world, see 4.</p>

<p>It is not yet known what impact, if any, the current fighting between ISIS and the Kurds is having on the Kurdish oil export business to Turkey.</p>

<p>Update 08/09
From February 2013
Iraq&#39;s Oil Rift (Between the Kurds and Baghdad) Deepens Over Exxon Move
Exxon Mobil to develop oil fields in Kurdish areas of Iraq

<p>Erdogan and Turkey </p>

<p>Erdogan has now completely fallen out of favor with, and split from, Washington DC. See 5.</p>

<p>Erdogan started negotiations to buy a $3.4bn missile defense system from China in late 2013, thus snubbing DC.</p>

<p>It is known that Erdogan is very frustrated with DC&#39;s lack of action in overtly arming the Islamic Extremist &quot;rebels&quot; in Syria.</p>

<p>Erdogan also became frustrated that the False Flag chemical weapons attack in Damascus, in August 2013, did not result in the start of a massive US bombing campaign in Syria and the subsequent start of an all out American military campaign in Syria.See 1.
The planned massive bombing campaign using over 100 Tomahawk Cruise Missiles just in the initial strike(s) would have had little effect on Assad&#39;s military capabilities and would have undoubtedly failed to meet it&#39;s supposed objectives to alter the course of the Syrian war. The bombs were always to be merely a stepping stone for more direct American military action, up to and including a significant number of American boots on the ground.</p>

<p>Erdogan is working with the Iraqi Kurds to sell their oil independently of Baghdad.</p>

<p>Erdogan has recently issued strong condemnations of Israel&#39;s attack on Gaza.
(This despite reports that one of the Kurdish oil tanker deliveries was to Israel at a steep discount - before Israel&#39;s invasion of Gaza.)</p>

<p>ISIS</p>

<p>ISIS captured Fallujah in early January and have been getting stronger ever since, so it wasn&#39;t a surprise when ISIS also captured Mosul in June, although the Western media made it out to be something that came completely out of the blue.</p>

<p>ISIS captures Fallujah amid rise in violence in Iraq.
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/al-qaeda-force-captures-fallujah-amid-rise-in-violence-in-iraq/2014/01/03/8abaeb2a-74aa-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/al-qaeda-force-captures-fallujah-amid-rise-in-violence-in-iraq/2014/01/03/8abaeb2a-74aa-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html</a></p>

<p>ISIS captured around $1bn worth of American supplied equipment when the Iraqi army threw off their uniforms and ran on the approach of ISIS to Mosul.
ISIS were far fewer in numbers (5,000-10,000) and far less equipped than the Iraqi army around Mosul at the time. This is not the case now. 
The captured equipment included a few tanks, 200 to 1,500 Humvees and armored cars, at least one military helicopter, some ManPad shoulder held anti aircraft missiles, 50 Howitzers, RPG&#39;s, plus a large quantity of ammunition and other military supplies.</p>

<p>It is unclear whether ISIS also accrued around $425m from banks in and around Mosul. There are now conflicting reports on this.  </p>

<p>ISIS&#39;s weapon inventory grows
<a href="http://www.dailysabah.com/mideast/2014/07/03/isiss-weapon-inventory-grows">http://www.dailysabah.com/mideast/2014/07/03/isiss-weapon-inventory-grows</a></p>

<p>ISIS has become the dominant Islamic Extremist group in Northern Syria, forcing out and marginalizing Al-Nusra in a series of battles between the two Islamic groups.
It obtained significant quantities of American/Saudi Arabia/Turkey supplied weapons (either through capture or direct supply) in Syria, before turning it&#39;s attention to Iraq around the turn of the year.
The weapons captured in Syria, include tanks, armored cars and TOW wire guided American manufactured anti tank missiles.</p>

<p>ISIS has operated in Iraq, Syria and Turkey for several years, but has only been fighting in Syria until fairly recently.</p>

<p>ISIS has been funded by Saudi Arabia since at least 2007, with the full support of the CIA.</p>

<p>If the NSA is actually fighting terrorism why haven&#39;t they stopped Saudi Arabia, Qatar &amp; Kuwait funding Islamic terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Nusra?

<p>US aims in Iraq</p>

<p>The primary immediate aim of the US in Iraq is to remove Maliki from power.
He has become far too friendly with both Iran and Russia. 
The &quot;crisis&quot; with ISIS in Iraq provides a mechanism with which to do this.</p>

<p>The overall aim of the US, Saudi Arabia and Israel is to destabilize the Middle East in order to promote arms spending, more war and for Saudi Arabia to obtain a high price for it&#39;s oil. </p>

<p>Destabilization of the Middle East and Middle East regimes, except for Saudi Arabia, Israel and the Gulf Oil States who are intimately allied with the US and Israel.</p>

<p>The facts about the oil price and oil politics that the US government, oil majors and major producers don&#39;t want you to see

<p>The activities of ISIS in Iraq promotes instability in the Middle East.</p>

<p>It is unclear, at least to me, what Obama intends to do about Turkey, Erdogan, the Kurds and Kurdish independent oil sales at this point in time. We await further developments.
The one thing that we can be sure of, is that Obama&#39;s decision to restart the bombing of Iraq has nothing whatsoever to do with any &quot;humanitarian&quot; concerns.</p>

<p>An additional complicating factor is that the Iraqi Kurds have had good relations for many years with Israel, particularly their current President - Masoud Barzani.

    <div class="md"><p>Good summary. Good backup links.</p>

<p>unfortunately it ALWAYS seems to be about removing all suppliers of oil from the international market except for the ones controlled by the Texas/Saudi oil alliance.</p>

<p>The more they keep other oil off the market the higher the price stays and the more those intertwined business people make money.</p>

<p>That goal and that goal alone is the ONLY explanation that ever completely jibes with all the actions the USA takes.</p>

<p>It why they went after Venezuela, Russia, Saddam hussein when he wanted to get the sanctions lifted and start pumping oil again, Libya, and now this.</p>

<p>It is ALWAYS the same.</p>

<p>All you need to do is see which countries leaders are suppling oil in competition to the Texas/ Saudi (kuwait - Qatar) oil alliance and they will suddenly be having all kinds of accusations and things happen to support taking themout - or they will have &quot;internal revolutions&quot; .
None of the publicly stated reasons by the USA government matter. they are simply made up to support the sanctions or military action to cripple the oil competition.</p>

<p>The real reason is ALWAYS about keeping all oil and gase supplies not controlled by the Texas/Saudi oilalliance off the world market to keep oil prices and profits high for those business men. </p>

<p>andthe thing that ticks me off is it would be oen thig if these guys were using the US military and CIA to make MOR EOIL available which would LOWER prices and benefit everyoe but instead they are usingthe USA military and CIA to RESTRICT oil to keep their PERSONAL oilprofits higher while costing the US taxpayers TRILLIONS in military costs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you will notice on your oil price graph</p>

<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BopSTTkx4xA/U8_-2VtbmNI/AAAAAAAAA_E/86vLa1gjUm0/s1600/Annotated+chart+of+Oil+Price+Shocks.jpg">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BopSTTkx4xA/U8_-2VtbmNI/AAAAAAAAA_E/86vLa1gjUm0/s1600/Annotated+chart+of+Oil+Price+Shocks.jpg</a></p>

<p>that when a Bush is either Vice President (running secret CIA ops under Ronald Reagan when not tryig to shoot him ) or President actions are taken which drives oil prices to around $100 per barrel from $30 or so. This is the Texas Buss&#39;s makingtheir Saudi Business partenrs as well asthemselves rich at the expense of the American military.</p>

<p>note the dates.</p>

<p>oil under $30</p>

<p>oil to $100
1980-88 vice presdient George H W Bush running CiA ops under Reagan (often without his knowledge as IranContra proved) and 1988 1992 G H W Bush president.</p>

<p>oil back to $30
1990 - 1998 Clinton and oil prices go down - no midle east ars or destablizations - instead Balkins war which had nothign to do with oil suppliers.</p>

<p>oil goes over $100
then George W Bush 2000-2008 president with of course 9/11 providingthe excuse to invade Iraq and stop Saddam who was literally onemonth away from gettingthe Un to lift sanctions on his country so he could flood the world with Iraq&#39;s oil which was equal in size to Saudi Arabia&#39;s fields or second to them.</p>

<p>Obama is the wild card but as he proved by doingthe secondhalf othe banking bailout payments right after takingoffice he was likely a CIA stooge choice who spoke well but did NONE of the liberal thigs people expected.</p>

<p>and he has repeatedly continued and taken new military action (in Iraq, Libya, Syria, ow threatening sanctions againstRussia for a Ukrainian problem caused by the US led revolution in Ukraine) to keep oil at over $100 a barrel andkeep Libyan, Syrian, Iraqi, and Russian oil off the market.
so it&#39;s pretty clear Obama is and always has been a CIA plant and that was indicted ealry on by his unorthodox acceptanc einto the Hawaii international school for childrenof US government agents and his father&#39;s activities in Kenya which likely had some CIA motivations. It also jibes withthe revelatiosn that happened when Obama was getting so muchmoney in small donatiosn duringhis first presidential runthat cameout of nowhere that knowledgable people said clearly where CIA donations funneled throught the internet (apparently internet fund raisingmade it MUCH easier fot he CIA to support chosen candidates becuase they nop longer had to form large donation front groups but could instead create huge numbers of small fake astroturf supporters donating under the $200 limit that doesn&#39;t not need to be reported.</p>

<p>and lets not forget about the failed cia coupe against Venezeulas leader whenhe started pumping huge amount s of his oil when oil got to be over $100 a barrel. and of course later he died of &quot;cancer&quot;. and now their is a new coupe destablization attempt against Venezuela&#39;s new leader.</p>

<p>It always always is about the Texas / Saudi oil alalince keeping prices high for which they get rewarded by being paid of by the Saudis through jointinvestment companies like Carlye which they use to buy defense companies  which then become worht much more when their weapons are bought by the government for war.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a pretty brilliant racket you have to admit.</p>

<p>too bad all of us US citizens pay the exorbitant cost in deficits, taxes, lack of infrastructure, war deaths, military overreaching, and trillions in new debt just to make those Texas/ Saudi oil alliance guys like the Bush&#39;s richer.</p>

<p>But it fits perfectly the Bush way of spending huge amounts of government money to enrich and guarantee profits for private companies and individuals whether they be banks or oil people or defense contractors or whatever else they happen to own.</p>

<p>the only other question is --- is Hilliary also part of the group?</p>

<p>I would say yes. never forget she was a lawyer helping to prosecute Nixon during watergate an that has been revealed to be a CIA (bush lead ) plot to take out Richard Nixon from office when he wasn&#39;t doing what they wanted. (just reconfirmed by ROger Stone in his explosive new book talked about here <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2d34d0/the_cia_hatched_two_plots_to_assassinate_nixon/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2d34d0/the_cia_hatched_two_plots_to_assassinate_nixon/</a>)</p>

<p>So i think Hilliary is part of it and of course she will run against Jeb Bush so once againt it&#39;s CIA oil money candidates all the way as our only two choices.</p>

<p>and of course just like Obama Hillairy will be called the &quot;liberal&quot; and yet if elected she will reward the companies and protect the Texas/Saudi oil profiters just like Obama has. Either she&#39;ll do it becuase she has been part of their scheme since helping bring down Nixon with watergate or because they will blackmail her. the whole media fed &quot;liberal&quot; vs &quot;conservative&quot; nonsense will keep the population screaming while no one follows the money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great analysis, as always.  This should be at the top of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> instead of that Putin 9/11 bs clickbait.</p>

<p>So ISIS is going to be used to rough up Iraq a bit, and remove Malaki and we&#39;ll probably install some interim puppet like &quot;Curveball&quot; Chalabi.  And yes, Erdogan doesn&#39;t have a long time left, if the US has its way.  Maybe he&#39;ll be succeeded by Gulen.</p>

<p>What are the chances we aim to balkanize iraq, turkey, syria and iran to create a separate kurdistan?  ISIS is clearly there to cause problems for anyone who might be looking to partner with the BRICS.  Similarly, Balochistan will be carved out of Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan</p>

<p>Lebanon is also going to be regime changed as they are coowners of the mediterranean leviathon gas fields which israel is going to be piping up through greece.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen Chalabi&#39;s name mentioned in a couple of articles as the replacement for Malaki, but it&#39;s pure speculation at the moment that he&#39;s a serious candidate.</p>

<p>Further snippets on Erdogan:- </p>

<p>Recent statements in support of de-dollarization and China/Russia Brics bank moves. </p>

<p>Welcomed Putin&#39;s call for more food exports from Turkey to Russia, with the Russian sanctions on EU food exports.</p>

<p>Lebanon has always been on the list - see PNAC.</p>
