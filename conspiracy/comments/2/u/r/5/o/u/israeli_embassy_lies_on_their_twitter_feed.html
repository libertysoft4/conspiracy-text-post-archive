    <div class="md"><p>Yes they do!   ISIS is the enemy of and they hate Israel more than anything.  I&#39;m the OP and I&#39;m not defending Israel.  The fact is that Israel will not help fight ISIS because they&#39;re Sunni Islam, and a highly radical Sunni Islam at that.  The biggest enemy to Iran is radical Sunni Islam, seeing how Iran is mostly Shiite and all.  And since Iran has helped the U.S. fight ISIS, Israel sticks up its nose (namely Benjamin Netanyahu) and they won&#39;t help.  Even though the U.S. gives Israel more money and aide than any other country on earth and it&#39;s a relatively rich country too with the most powerful military in the region, Israel refuses to help and they border Syria!</p>

<p>Israel is at odds with Hezbollah over Lebanon and the Golan Heights.  It&#39;s my belief that Israel wants all the Golan Heights and the West Bank for itself, Palestinians be damned.  The Likud party doesn&#39;t want peace or a two-state solution.  They&#39;ll say it&#39;s impossible, or their &#39;doom&#39; if there is a Palestine nation.  It&#39;s all Likud party B.S. and they&#39;re nothing more than the puke that came out of the Irgun paramilitary.  IF you look at the Irgun patch (Google it), you&#39;ll see the Likud party&#39;s true intentions.  I think Israel wants a big chunk of Syria for themselves and much like the 1967 takeover, they&#39;ll say it&#39;s for their security - You can mark that one down.  Then they&#39;ll start building more homes and hope folks will just forget they stole it.  And if you can keep war going and tear down old governments, there isn&#39;t anyone left to say you can&#39;t.  And the local citizens, they&#39;re just an inconvenience.  They&#39;ll re-label them, like calling Palestinians, &quot;Jordanians&quot;, or something stupid like that.  </p>

<p>JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli intelligence overplayed the threat posed by Iraq and reinforced the U.S. and British assessment that Saddam Hussein had large amounts of weapons of mass destruction, a retired Israeli general said Thursday.</p>

<p>The Israeli assessment may have been colored by politics, including a desire to see the Iraqi leader toppled, said Shlomo Brom, who was a senior Israeli military intelligence officer and is now a researcher with Israel&#39;s top strategic think tank.</p>

<p>No one is really sure how deep it goes.  That is why I said &quot;million dollar question&quot;. </p>

<p>There have been many intelligence agencies that have admitted that they knew in advance.  In this case, the question posed was</p>

<p>I can&#39;t tell if you are generally confused by the myriad of information (conflicting or otherwise)available about different intelligence agencies, or are just choosing to be a snarky cunt.  In either case the worn out &quot;lizard people&quot; jibe, is fairly exclusive to places like <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and other subs that poke fun at people who have questions about historical events.

<p>It came from a book called The Biggest Secret by David Icke AFAIK.  Conspiratard may not have come up with it, but they certainly have gotten their mileage out of it.  At this point, I view it as a disparagement tool for the lazy.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>People here?  Or you heard that some people believe it, and it rang true with your particular bias towards a large group of individuals?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Most people can&#39;t.  That is why they come to places like this to discuss it.  </p>

<p>It can be exhausting trying to parse so much information by yourself.  Especially when you feel like you can&#39;t really trust anything you read, and you have to refrain from having an opinion towards one side or the other.  I mean, I have my opinions, but the more I learn, the more I realize that I don&#39;t know anything, so I have to be willing to change my opinion as I learn new things.  </p>
