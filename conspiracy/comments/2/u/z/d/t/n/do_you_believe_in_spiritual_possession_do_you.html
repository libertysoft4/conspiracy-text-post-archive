    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t <em>not</em> believe in that sort of thing because I try not to close myself off to what I don&#39;t understand.</p>

<p>However, if you have Grandparents, take a look at their medications and then take a look at the side effects of those medications and then take a look at the number of medications and then take a look at the side effects of those medications if your grandparent decides to do something fun like they used to do like have a glass of wine too close to pill-time. Or if they say, &quot;Screw this noise, I&#39;m not taking these pills anymore!&quot; Or if Medicare says, &quot;Uh, these pills are too expensive, you&#39;re cut off.&quot; Or forget anything - you&#39;re 90 years old on 17 meds, many of which screw up your brain function, how do you remember to take every one of those on time? Or at all?</p>

<p>Seriously, we&#39;re blessed it isn&#39;t like Night of the Living Dead out there. :( </p>

<p>I have no idea what their doctors are thinking, I&#39;d love to have a sit-down with my grandparents&#39; doctors, that&#39;s for damned sure. HIPAA&#39;s really fantastic for protecting this kind of criminality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s an off-label use, isn&#39;t it? Seroquel&#39;s an anti-psychotic. I would urge her to read up on it as much as she can, it&#39;s scary stuff. If she does go on it and has issues, she needs to know it&#39;s not her, it&#39;s the med screwing with her brain and to try to overcome - that&#39;s what Robin Williams had just started taking, btw--prescribed seven days before his suicide. :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You gotta tell her that she can&#39;t go cold turkey - all those meds have issues when you take too much or if you take too little. You have to go slowly, slowly off of them with a doctor&#39;s help. I had a family member in the same situation, she was scary. Realized what it was and figured a way to slowly cut down, but you have to be really, really careful. It can take a year or two to properly wean off and become &quot;normal&quot; again. Sending good healing thoughts her way, this stuff sucks.</p>

<p>Scary stuff, I have no idea how these docs and pharma people sleep at night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ugh, I am so sorry. :( Sending healing thoughts to you, too! People I know have gotten off them successfully, but slowly and patiently is the way to go, and awareness that it&#39;s not you, it&#39;s it if you start having crazy thoughts I think can be helpful. It&#39;s weird that the medical community refuses to make a big deal of these medications&#39; withdrawal problems, sounds hells worse than heroin in a lot of cases.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>“Trillaphon” was published in the Amherst Review, and more recently in Tin House, but appears here for the first time for popular consumption in book form. It inaugurates The David Foster Wallace Reader with these ominous words: “I’ve been on antidepressants for, what, about a year now, and I suppose I feel as if I’m pretty qualified to tell what they’re like. They’re fine, really, but they’re fine in the same way that, say, living on another planet that was warm and comfortable and had food and fresh water would be fine: it would be fine, but it wouldn’t be good old Earth, obviously.” This is juvenilia, sure, but it is revealing. “Everything in you is sick and grotesque,” Wallace writes in “Trillaphon” of the depression that never relinquished its hold on him. This slight story may be the most personally revealing thing he ever wrote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be, but it sounds like a bad, bad spirit world to me. People on antipsychotics or antidepressants who get the &quot;bad reaction&quot; get superparanoid, start fantasizing about guns, demons and death. Much prefer even the LSD spirit world...we&#39;re all connected and woah, the floors are water, let&#39;s go eat fruit, wow, it&#39;s complicated, the world is complicated and alive and beautiful. Not &quot;the demons told me I need to kill my entire family and suicide by cop.&quot; </p>

<p>I read something aways back about how the fluorine in some of these medications when mixed somehow can create the active ingredient in PCP. Sort of makes sense, I guess, but I&#39;m not a chemist and I can&#39;t find the source anymore. I only really discovered the connection of SSRIs/Antipsychotics/anti-epileptics/etc. because my whole &quot;Oh, it&#39;s PCP&quot; whenever there was a weird crime was obviously not correct anymore...so the connection makes sense to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was on SSRIs for years, and didn&#39;t have deeply profound spiritual experiences, compared to now. Come to think of it, I didn&#39;t have profound feelings about anything, except anger &amp; rage. My rage was insane, especially when I drank. Funny, I was on a mood stabilizer and felt so out of sync w the world, both when I was sober for years, or not. I felt different every day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, since 2010. Briefly tried Cymbalta for nerve pain in 2012 &amp; had the immediate return of suicidal ideation. I got clean &amp; sober in the past year &amp; returned to AA, therapy &amp; church. The difference of attending all of that without prescription medication has been like night &amp; day. So much of my &quot;happiness&quot; is diet, exercise, sleep, my spiritual condition &amp; being of help and around others. Our culture has gotten SO FAR away from true human conditions. We&#39;re made to move, to make eye contact, to be around others, caring, feeding, laughing. I never want to go back to the drunk, drugged out days, illuminated only by the light of the tv or computer screen, my only interactions w store clerks or facebook notifications. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re thinking at the &quot;complete technological totalitarian system has already been deployed and we&#39;re deep within it&quot; level? Is that right? We exist post-coup now. Surveillance systems are already in place, and our worst technological fears are implemented today, not &quot;in 15 more years if we don&#39;t change&quot;. If that&#39;s the case, I understand your posts much better now. </p>

<p>When do you think the shift happened? Does this system coming to light reflect an intention of the system itself, ie &quot;We run this place, and this is how its going to be.&quot; Or is the revelation of the current system a consequence of another system gaining technological superiority? Or still other reasons?</p>

<p>No. They have some serious shit and Northrop Grumman are the ones with the Ark of The Covenant now. They are the most advanced there is and they can travel the known universe and beyond now. The great and sad thing is that they are just normal Humans greedy with their stuff. </p>

<p>JediSchool is what they called the Godschool. Apparently something happened with their system, May 20 2012 and some on both teams got freed. I am a Sith because we go by Lords and Royalty in the dream machine I got taught in. It s not a bad thing or a good thing it just is a thing. The Jedi dream machine was for the False Christ they built up and tore down to play God. The real God got mad about that  though. Now they want to fight God. </p>
