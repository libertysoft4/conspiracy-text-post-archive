<p>After making an impossible turn due to the speed</p>

<p><a href="http://pilotsfor911truth.org/pentagon.html">http://pilotsfor911truth.org/pentagon.html</a></p>

<p>&quot;At 9:37:46, American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon, traveling at approximately <strong>530 miles per hour.</strong> All on board, as well as many civilian and military personnel in the building, were killed.&quot;</p>

<p><em>So, lets go on what we have. The last known altitude reported for AA77 was 7000 feet. And travelled 33 miles in 5 minutes. Thats 6.6 miles per minute or 396 knots (Update: FDR data shows 325 knots average airspeed. 9/11 Commission Report is inaccurate). Then the aircraft began a 330 degree spiraling dive, leveling at 2200 feet to accelerate to the Pentagon while continuing descent. He started the maneuver at 7000 feet, 396 knots, dove almost 5000 feet within a 330 degree turn and covered 5 miles in about 3 minutes. According to the 9/11 Commission Report, the final impact speed was 530 mph.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.dcclothesline.com/2014/12/08/911-update-proof-no-boeing-757-hit-pentagon/">Ground Effect</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is directly proportional to the speed of the aircraft (i.e., faster the speed, stronger the ground effect)</li>
<li>Becomes discernible when an aircraft descends to within approximately ONE wingspan of the ground</li>
<li>Becomes progressively more pronounced as the craft descends further</li>
<li>Reaches its maximum value when the aircraft is at a height of approximately one HALF wingspan, at which point it begins to demonstrate characteristics of incompressibility (i.e., offers resistance, or “pushes back”)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This is a Law. This Law applies to ALL fixed wing aircraft.</strong></p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, the laws of physics were not temporarily suspended on 9/11/2001, and flimsy aluminium plane wings could not have sliced clean through through those WTC structural steel girders on that day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The wings are triangular in shape.  The wings wouldn&#39;t all hit the building at the same time.  The part of the wings that would hit the building is the area nearest the fuselage.  Is it possible that this caused the wings to shear off backwards?  Seems entirely plausible to me.  In fact this seems far more plausible than thinking the wings are just going to stay on the plane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an engineer id like to add a little bit here, steel will always cut through aluminium because of aluminium&#39;s physical properties</p>

<p>*Density, ρ:kg m−3&gt; Alu = 2700 Steel = 7800</p>

<p>*Young modulus, E:N mm−2&gt; Alu = 70000 Steel = 210000</p>

<p>*Shear modulus, G:N mm−2&gt; Alu = 27000 Steel = 81000</p>

<p>*Poisson ratio, ν&gt; Alu = 0.33 Steel = 0.3</p>

<p>*Coefficient of linear thermal expansion, α:K−1&gt; Alu = 23 × 10−6 Steel = 12 × 10−6</p>

<p><a href="http://aluminium.matter.org.uk/content/html/eng/default.asp?catid=217&amp;amp;pageid=2144417130">Source</a></p>

<p>Whats of interest is the shear modulus because this indicates when the metal is essentially cut and as you can see steel is three times as strong (although i doubt this was the case; Aircraft use some fancy aluminium alloys, still over twice as strong mind you) </p>

<p>Even with the aircraft being the moving body this is negated by newtons third law &quot;For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The statement means that in every interaction, there is a pair of forces acting on the two interacting objects. The size of the forces on the first object equals the size of the force on the second object.&quot; Therefore even if you were to calculate what was going to happen and mistakenly stated the building was flying at 450km/h you would still have the same result.</p>

<p>inb4/ Obviously if you were to do that your value for inertia will be completely fucked</p>

<p>EDIT: formatting/sorry if you dont like my correct spelling of Aluminium, hehe</p>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t believe how many people don&#39;t understand this, including on this subreddit.</p>

<p>When flying at 500mph even air resistance (at ground level) is enough to tear a Boeing&#39;s aluminium aircraft wings apart. Yet people here think those same wings would shear through massive steel support structures? Insane.</p>

<p>How can you say that?! Don&#39;t be closed minded. I don&#39;t understand you guys. I think the pentagon was struck by a global hawk drone.

<p>There were several pieces of easily identifiable debris that matched the exact model of plane that crashed into the Pentagon. How would a hawk drone do that? On top of that, the crash doesn&#39;t remotely resemble an explosion or even a crash from such a small aircraft.</p>

<p>The north flyby proves Lloyd couldn&#39;t been hit by a light pole.  The light poles are on the SOUTH side.  That doesn&#39;t fit the story.  He couldn&#39;t have been hit when all the other witnesses say the plane flew north......do you understand?</p>

<p>If you know enough about LLoyd, you should know enough about the entire story.  You should know what Lloyd himself said about the event.  You&#39;re either playing dumb or you&#39;ve heard it and don&#39;t want to mention it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>how come most of your posts are nonsensical bullshit about northrup, but all of a sudden you become coherent when trying to say a plane hit the pentagon.</p>

<p>what little footage has been released shows a missile(like) object.</p>

<p>Some people say its the fuselage without the wings, but its before impact (although since the speed at which the plane supposedly approached would have torn them off anyway), you can see how people MIGHT believe that, but they would be wrong) .. there were no wings on the ground</p>

<p>very little debris and none of it large enough to be from a crashed jetliner</p>

<p>The simpletons who can&#39;t understand the impact into the towers/Pentagon imparts the same force and reaction to the planes standing still and being hit by the buildings at 500mph.  Swung just like a baseball bat.  Would all planes react identically in this fashion?  No reflected plane material outwards?  Absolutely none seen in any photographs or videos of any of the 3 alleged impacts.  Why is that?  The science doesn&#39;t jive bro.</p>

This should be discussed until the truth of this event is fully in the open.  We&#39;ve been lied to for far too long.</p>

<p>&quot;At 9:37:46, American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon, traveling at approximately <strong>530 miles per hour.</strong> All on board, as well as many civilian and military personnel in the building, were killed.&quot;</p>

<p><em>So, lets go on what we have. The last known altitude reported for AA77 was 7000 feet. And travelled 33 miles in 5 minutes. Thats 6.6 miles per minute or 396 knots (Update: FDR data shows 325 knots average airspeed. 9/11 Commission Report is inaccurate). Then the aircraft began a 330 degree spiraling dive, leveling at 2200 feet to accelerate to the Pentagon while continuing descent. He started the maneuver at 7000 feet, 396 knots, dove almost 5000 feet within a 330 degree turn and covered 5 miles in about 3 minutes. According to the 9/11 Commission Report, the final impact speed was 530 mph.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.dcclothesline.com/2014/12/08/911-update-proof-no-boeing-757-hit-pentagon/">Ground Effect</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is directly proportional to the speed of the aircraft (i.e., faster the speed, stronger the ground effect)</li>
<li>Becomes discernible when an aircraft descends to within approximately ONE wingspan of the ground</li>
<li>Becomes progressively more pronounced as the craft descends further</li>
<li>Reaches its maximum value when the aircraft is at a height of approximately one HALF wingspan, at which point it begins to demonstrate characteristics of incompressibility (i.e., offers resistance, or “pushes back”)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This is a Law. This Law applies to ALL fixed wing aircraft.</strong></p>
