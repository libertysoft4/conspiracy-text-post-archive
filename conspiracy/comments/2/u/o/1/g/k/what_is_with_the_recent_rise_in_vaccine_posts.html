    <div class="md"><p>you are wrong.</p>

<p>First of all some people resist the vaccine through no fault of their own.</p>

<p>Second, and this is extremely important to remember, some people cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons, such as children with weakened immune systems from things like...oh Leukemia and chemotherapy.</p>

<p>So a child who is being treated for and has the possibility of surviving cancer cannot be immunized against measles, but kid whose parents are irrationally afraid of vaccines (amagad its gonna give mah child the autisms) gets measles and spreads it to someone who spreads it to kid with leukemia who dies.</p>

<p>That outbreak shouldn&#39;t have happened. The people who are immune protect those that cant be immunized from dying of diseases that shouldnt be being spread around at all. </p>

<p>So no, not everyone who is pro vaccine is perfectly safe, and the behavior of anti vaccine idiots who dont believe in science is putting lives in danger. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The <strong>real</strong> point of the issue is autonomy. Choice. Do children belong to the parents or the state?  Does the state have the right to force anyone to take a medication - regardless of other considerations? I say the Parents should have 100% say about their child&#39;s health. And that the state has <em>no</em> right - at all - to force its citizens to take any medication, ever. Now, that said, I do realize that there are a lot of mitigating factors. Religious nuts. Uneducated people. Propaganda (both for and against). </p>

<p>But if we allow the government to dictate to us how, or if, we take any medication, vaccines or otherwise, then our whole society will be irrevocably harmed - forever, because we all know that once the state gets a certain power it is <em>always</em> misused.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do understand the concern, but vaccines are not just a matter of the government forcing medication on people.</p>

<p>This is an issue of public health that affects everyone, potentially.</p>

<p>For that matter, while parents should make medical decisions for their children, do we draw the line at something that potentially puts that child&#39;s life at risk?</p>

<p>If a parent does something directly harmful to their child, like leave them outside in the snow while they go to work (extreme example I know) no one would argue that child should be protected from their parent. The child has no choice in the matter, and probably wouldn&#39;t choose to freeze to death in the snow if given the choice. </p>

<p>I believe that parents that refuse to allow their children to be vaccinated are neglectful and putting their child&#39;s life in danger. I do believe it is justified for the government to intervene when a parent puts their child&#39;s life in danger. It is neglect and abuse. </p>

<p>Edit: A child that young, does not understand the nature of the vaccine argument. They do not understand the implications of not being vaccinated. That point could go towards or against vaccination IF the science didn&#39;t overwhelmingly support the safety of vaccines, while most of the anti crowd is relying on bad research and misinformation (i.e. vaccines cause autism).</p>

<p>I dont belive that parents should be able to put their children&#39;s lives at risk so recklessly. </p>

<p>Now <em>you</em> are wrong. That is pure propaganda. Check the facts. No Measles deaths in over ten years. Suddenly the vaccines start and Measles are killing children? </p>

<p>I will <em>never</em> agree to giving the state absolute power over people&#39;s bodies - regardless of circumstances. That said, it is the states job to start to <em>properly and correctly</em> educating its citizens instead of using school for political indoctrination. This would include medical issues. But the government is not interested in educated citizens - just mindless obedient ones who don&#39;t question anything. This is bad. A truly educated population is good for <em>everyone</em>. State dictatorial power is never a good substitute for education - true education. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are changing the subject but yes, like I already stated several times in this thread, the vaccine is not 100 percent effective.</p>

<p>What it is extremely effective at is preventing the disease from having a breeding ground, and extremely limiting the transmission rates of the disease. </p>

<p>Your point is even more of an argument in favor of vaccines, I believe. </p>

<p>The point I made earlier was that some people are still vulnerable after vaccination, but the vast majority are not vulnerable. Which means that people that choose not to vaccinate are putting those people who did but didn&#39;t gain immunity at risk. </p>

<p>No. My point is <em>free choice</em>! I sent you that link (and submitted it to the sub as well) to play Devil&#39;s advocate. If you think that getting a vaccine for you and/or your children is the right thing to do then by God, you should do just that. But. You (or anyone else) have no right to force that choice on others - ever - for <em>any</em> reason.</p>

<p>No one expects vaccines to be perfectly uniform to everyone, that&#39;s not the argument.</p>

<p>What they DO is prevent large widespread outbreaks of diseases that have killed many people throughout history.

    <div class="md"><p>I never said vaccines ARE the diagnosis, the thought that everyone ought to use the same exact formulation WITHOUT proper individual diagnosis is YOUR argument. Which is as ludicrous as it is dangerous and pompous.</p>

<p>Each patient must be taken on a case by case basis. Tested for possible side effects. And then determine if the side effects outweigh the benefits or not. Then and only then can an informed decision be made on whether or not vaccination IS WHAT&#39;S BEST FOR THE PATIENT.</p>

<p>Instead, people like you want to just go ahead and make a blind, blanket diagnosis of the nation, as if everyone had the same exact body chemistry.</p>

<p>For the most part, humans are greatly alike, but everyone is slightly different from one another. Can you not agree to that? Then why can you not agree to the fact that using the SAME EXACT formula on EVERYONE will have DIFFERENT effects on all those different body chemistries? And that forcing everyone to use the same proprietary formula will only lead to great numbers of unnecessary side effects?</p>

<p>There is no universal answer for a topic such as this, the human body is too complicated to pigeonhole everyone to use the same proprietary formula.</p>

<p>HOWEVER, that child is at extreme risk of infection if exposed to the disease and also carries a higher risk of serious complications or even death BECAUSE of that weakened immune system. Those children are relying on other people having the vaccination to prevent them from being exposed to the disease. Every anti-vaxx parent that chooses to not vaccinate their children is potentially putting one of those childrens lives at risk.</p>

<p>There ARE children whose doctors determine that they can&#39;t be vaccinated for health reasons. It ALREADY exists, so you are arguing for something that is already real WITH vaccinations.</p>

<p>Any doctor worth their salt will reach a proper diagnosis before administrating powerful substances into their patients. They don&#39;t pigeonhole all of their patients into one large group and medicate them identically. No,sir. And this is no laughing matter.</p>

<p>I still don&#39;t think you&#39;ve thought this through for more than a day or two. You simply hear something that scares you and then you react predictably. It&#39;s sad.</p>

<p>I am not going to be silent while people get all hysterical over the measles vaccination. And advocate forcing all children to take it without going through the proper channels. In other words: testing for allergies and pre-existing conditions BEFORE administering these potentially dangerous proprietary formulations.</p>

<p>You took my original preposition of &quot;Any American who thinks the government has the right to either violently force the use of vaccines on the public or discriminate against people who LAWFULLY chose not to vaccinate ought to move&quot;</p>

<p>And built the straw man argument that:

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize that measles requires a higher level of vaccination to control than most other vaccinated diseases right?</p>

<p>One infection of measles often causes a very high rate of secondary infections, compared to other diseases. So the less people that are immune, the higher the rate of infection is.</p>

<p>It is basic math.</p>

<p>The vaccination is not 100 percent effective (more like 95) and some people aren&#39;t able to be immunized. So the more vulnerable our population is, the more likely those people are to be infected.</p>

<p>If 95 percent of people are immune, the odds of infection spreading are much lower than if it drops to 90 or 85 percent or whatever, because measles has such a high secondary infection rate. </p>

<p>Even with perfect 100 percent vaccination, there is a small chance that one person can get infected that isn&#39;t immune. But with that high vaccination rate, the odds of causing a secondary infection are low. The less people are immunized, the higher that secondary infection rate is and (guess what) outbreak!</p>

<p>I&#39;m not opposed at the <em>concept</em> of vaccination. It&#39;s a proven prevention method. It&#39;s likely many of us here are alive or in a healthy physical condition today thanks to them. Yes, different diseases require different inoculation methods, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are missing the point.</p>

<p>Even if it is only 95 percent effective, and some will still be vulnerable, there aren&#39;t outbreaks because the disease has nowhere to spread. No public health crisis. No epidemic. Fringe cases of infection MAYBE. </p>

<p>But what we have right now is NOT the result of ineffective vaccines. It is the result of the unvaccinated giving a breeding ground to the disease and allowing it to spread</p>

<p>Those 5 percent that were vulnerable are now a much bigger deal with people refusing vaccines. Before it was unlikely they would be exposed to the disease, now the odds of exposure are much higher.</p>

<p>The disease has hosts to breed and spread in. The infection rate of measles is extremely high. Giving it the slightest bit of room to spread amplifies it greatly.</p>

<p>Measles spreads easily. It is airborne and highly contagious.</p>

<p>One person with measles infects more people than one person with EBOLA, and our country was freaking the F out about a few ebola cases. You saw how we had to react to that because there is no ebola vaccine.</p>

<p>This measles outbreak is a serious public health issue and people need to get their shit together and protect their children.</p>

<p>How the hell would you feel if you didn&#39;t vaccinate your child and they died of measles? Is that fair to them? Your child doesn&#39;t get to make the choice, you make it for them and they suffer for it. </p>

<p>The nifty thing about science and scientists is that they publish their research. They publish their math. They publish the reproduction steps of their experiments. They publish their findings.</p>

<p>Then, other scientists can come along and evaluate all those things. They can poke holes in them. They can attempt the experiments again to see if they get the same or different results. They can check the math to see if it&#39;s right, or they can find errors. They can validate the research.</p>

<p>And built right into that whole thing is the, &quot;<strong>I&#39;m better than you</strong>&quot; mentality. If I can poke holes in the stuff you published, if I can disprove it, I automatically prove that I&#39;m better / smarter than you are. And sometimes, depending on whose published works I disproved, I might even get worldwide recognition and/or a lot of money as a reward.</p>

<p>My soul is what&#39;s telling me that what is happening in this world right now is very scary. The single thought of how much control these people have over our lives and souls is outright scary. </p>

<p>This is all we&#39;ve known, and the possibility of everything falling to pieces before our very eyes.. is something I honestly cannot fully grasp and understand. You know how when you realize something huge? And you feel it? I don&#39;t feel that when I think of it because they have made such a possibility literally so unimaginable it&#39;s insanity. That scares me. How will I react when shit really does start falling apart? Thoughts like these alone try my soul.</p>

<p>Your soul is your will, and I have a <em>will</em> to do the best I can to protect the people I love. And while past vaxxing could have been safe and okay.. There is purpose behind this incredible push behind vaccination right now, and I do not intend to be a part of that.</p>

<p>You are letting statistics control your fate, and it doesn&#39;t matter if you survive or not. You are basing what you believe in on statistics. And that&#39;s your choice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize that measles requires a higher level of vaccination to control than most other vaccinated diseases right?</p>

<p>One infection of measles often causes a very high rate of secondary infections, compared to other diseases. So the less people that are immune, the higher the rate of infection is.</p>

<p>It is basic math.</p>

<p>The vaccination is not 100 percent effective (more like 95) and some people aren&#39;t able to be immunized. So the more vulnerable our population is, the more likely those people are to be infected.</p>

<p>If 95 percent of people are immune, the odds of infection spreading are much lower than if it drops to 90 or 85 percent or whatever, because measles has such a high secondary infection rate. </p>

<p>Even with perfect 100 percent vaccination, there is a small chance that one person can get infected that isn&#39;t immune. But with that high vaccination rate, the odds of causing a secondary infection are low. The less people are immunized, the higher that secondary infection rate is and (guess what) outbreak!</p>

<p>Nevermind. This requires too much critical thinking for you. </p>
