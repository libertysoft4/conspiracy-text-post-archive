        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why should I accept the word of health authorities on the safety of vaccines without a double blind placebo controlled study?</p>

<p>Is this technically even ethical? Is this why I have not seen any such study?</p>

<p>If this is the case then would a documented survey of health and medical records of a large number of vaccinated and non-vaccinate children be the next best candidate? (The vaccinated would have to be divided up into different groups depending on their received vaccines.)</p>

<p>Why have I not seen any such study from someone like the CDC? The statistics I have seen are subject to many uncontrolled factors. Also, any statistics that i have seen are presented in a way such that cherry picking of data is a possibility.</p>

<p>When I am injecting a cocktail of mercury, msg, disabled virus/parts etc, directly into a child&#39;s bloodstream, should I be content in doing so without said survey? </p>

<p>Yes it seems that I can be provided with statistics that show correlations of lowered incidences of measles etc with vaccination, but does not say anything about the safety of vaccines. </p>

<p>I welcome anyone to provide me with clear data regarding the safety of vaccines.</p>

<p>Ultimately, as this debate goes, it really comes down to the heath of vaccinated children vs unvaccinated.</p>

<p>Logical answers would be nice please. I&#39;ve herd all the accusations and insults, and those are unscientific and have no effect on this conspiracy crowd.</p>

<p>Edit: as to is</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The CDC will not allow a study to be done comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated, this is because they know what the result will be.  </p>

<p>Fortunately for us researchers from Germany have done a survey with an ENORMOUS sample size of both vaccinated and unvaccinated children and the results are astounding.  Vaccinated children are FAR more prone to illness and disease than their unvaccinated counterparts.  <a href="http://vactruth.com/2014/02/26/unvaccinated-children-healthier/">Here is an article on the subject</a>.  A similar study <a href="http://www.mednat.org/vaccini/dannivacc_study.pdf">was conducted in 1992  in New Zealand</a> with nearly the same results.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m having a hard time finding the survey but I believe a lot of results are posted at <a href="http://www.vaccineinjury.info">www.vaccineinjury.info</a>  be aware this survey appears to be on-going and the scum of the earth like David Gorski (main writer of the horrendous shill website sciencebasedmedicine.org who, I kid you not, is currently performing trials for a cancer medicine developed by Sanofi to try and approve it as an autism medicine.  All the while vehemently denying any environmental causes of autism and going so far as to say that diet doesn&#39;t effect health and pharmaceuticals are the only cure for all illness.  I can&#39;t stress enough how much of a scumbag this guy is) and his minions are actively and admittedly sabotaging the results.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I am no expert, but would it not be reasonable to obtain massive amounts of documented medical data, and sort the data into unvaccinated, and vaccinated. The vaccinated category would be split into all combinations of vaccinations given. The documented health issues of these individuals would then be tallied up. A comparison would then be allowed.</p>

<p>It could turn out to be something like: decrease your risk of one medical problem, but increase your risk of another ( in either direction). Or the study could favor one side or another in some or all cases.</p>

<p>I guess the health problems would have to be categorized by severity level with a given reasonable measure. ( where of course death of an individual would carry a lot of weight) this would be the most subjective part</p>

<p>But like I said I am not an expert... Maybe the data could just be presented. </p>

<p>Maybe it would encourage production of safer vaccines, may e we would find out the risks of vaccines are fine. Maybe we would find d out the risk is too much. That would have to be addressed in an actuarial manner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would be a monumental task. Also, I think the scope of this idea is too big. Doing this kind of huge trawl of data, you&#39;d be bound to get some results which looked significant just by chance... most studies are reported on the basis that any result with a lower than 1 in 20 chance is significant i.e. we can say with high probablity that the result is due to an actual effect.</p>

<p>Spreading your net this wide would lead to spurious results... you need to have a theory to investigate first.</p>

<p>It would make more sense to look at theories or claims which have been made about vaccine&#39;s (e.g. &quot;flu vacc increases chance of dying from a stroke&quot; - I just made that one up) and focus on that. Otherwise it&#39;s just too much data to get anything meaningful from.</p>

<p>Also, with the kind of study you are suggesting, factoring in confounding variables would be an absolute nightmare.</p>

<p>I wonder if instead if this, a test for the subjects to measure their physical fitness, intellectual fitness, an social stuff (sanity, empathy, etc) </p>

<p>not ideal, but at least a seemingly reasonable task. Then you skip the details.</p>

<p>Would this be feasible?</p>

<p>Like I said not an expert, just brainstorming. It sure would be nice to actually have something solid.</p>

<p>Edit: after some thought, I have decided , yes it is a monumental task... But this is the &quot;safety of the public&quot;. </p>

<p>Another monumental task in the name of &quot; safety of the public&quot; is vaccinating more than 90% of us. </p>

<p>What is the harm in undertaking another monumental task? What is the harm in finding a next-best study if said monumental task is not at all feasible?</p>

<p>I guess my concern is the lack of effort to find evidence highly suggestive of vaccine safety. the fact that nothing exists that is even attempting this.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that is the case... there have been studies on many &quot;vaccine X causes Y&quot; hypotheses over the years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it would generate false positives, I guess that&#39;s why it would rely on random large samples.</p>

<p>As far as these studies go on the vaccine x causing y, what data do they use? In the same sense could this not lead to the same false positives? Does this rely on reports from physicians, or an actual study on a trial of people? Something else? This is why I am asking these questions. Hoping to learn more.</p>

<p>Really it is difficult to study this to conclusive point for reasons pointed out here. </p>

<p>So many factors and no possibility of a controlled situation without being unethical. One can only pull facts from here or there and hope for the best.</p>

<p>In the end, my point is, I have every right to be confused about the issue. It comes down to opinions in the end. Which is not something I am not comfortable with I&#39;m regard to my loved one&#39;s health.</p>

<p>Sure if I had a kid you might be able to convince me to VAX for &quot;serious&quot; diseases, but I would be spreading those out way more than recommended.</p>

<p>But you would have a hard time convincing me to vaccinate for chicken pox, hep, flu. I could not take the risk with current data. </p>

<p>It comes down to me seeing that most people are just &quot;fine&quot; and they are vaccinated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I guess my concern is the lack of effort to find evidence highly suggestive of vaccine safety. The fact that nothing exists that is even attempting this.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that is the case... there have been studies on many &quot;vaccine X causes Y&quot; hypotheses over the years. </p>

<p>As I said previously, what you are suggesting would generate false positives... you need to be testing a more specific link for this kind of data trawl to work.</p>
