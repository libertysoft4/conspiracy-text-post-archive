<blockquote>
<p>Never mind the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and other basic freedoms that uphold parents’ rights to make decisions about the health care their children receive.</p>

<p>Never mind the evidence that vaccines aren’t as effective as their makers have promised.</p>

<p>Shutter to think, according to the Office of Medical and Scientific Justice, “the theory of ‘herd immunity’ is failing or was flawed to begin with” while a <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/vaccine-mccarthyism-what-if-the-vaccine-paradigm-itself-is-deliberately-flawed/5427768">2014 Council on Foreign Relations report</a> found:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“the most highly vaccinated populations are also those with the greatest number of outbreaks for those same infectious diseases. This was especially the case for measles, mumps, rubella, polio and pertussis outbreaks,” with the U.S. Canada and rest of the Western world leading the list.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Never mind all that.</p>

<p>For many, the measles outbreak at Disneyland is the proof that this matter should no longer be a choice.</p>

<p>Already, <a href="http://abc7.com/health/south-pasadena-woman-refuses-quarantine-after-sister-gets-measles/474623/">an unvaccinated Pasadena woman has been forcibly quarantined</a> after her sister contracted measles.</p>

<p>But it is going further.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/01/27/jail-anti-vax-parents-vaccines-cdc-measles-disney-world-california-column/22420771/">USA Today columnist Alex Berezow boldly proclaimed:</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Parents who do not vaccinate their children should go to jail. Anti-vaxxers often claim the right not to put “poison” in their children’s bodies. That is ludicrous. A mountain of data has demonstrated that vaccines are safe and effective. Insisting otherwise is akin to believing that the moon landing was faked.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tell that to the parents of Keira Driscoll, <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/a-5-year-old-girl-just-died-of-the-very-strain-of-flu-she-was-vaccinated-against_012015#sthash.rWLEm1Ju.dpuf">a five year who died</a> from very strain of the flu that she was vaccinated against just three days after receiving an immunization.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/statisticsreports.html">Or the 15,000 families</a> that have had little other recourse than to file claims in the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program after serious injury or death to their child since the program was created in 1988.</p>

<p>The benefits of vaccination have been systematically oversold for one obvious reason – to drive sales with public health mandates and a huge booster of fear – for the profit of Big Pharma.</p>

<p>And this push has not been harmless, it has put many people at risk and devastated families – all because margins of known risk from the vaccines have been accepted as a minor casualty in the effort for the “greater good.”</p>

<p>Berezow argues:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Measles is perhaps the most infectious human disease. Virus particles can remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves. And measles is not a minor infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that before widespread vaccination began in 1980, 2.6 million people a year died from measles. About 400 people a day still do.</p>

<p>&quot;Put simply, no person has the right to threaten the safety of his community. Like drunken drivers, the unvaccinated pose an imminent danger to others. They pose a lethal threat to the most vulnerable: the immunocompromised, such as HIV or cancer patients, and infants who have yet to receive their vaccines.</p>

<p>&quot;Anti-vaccine parents are turning their children into little walking time bombs. They ought to be charged for endangering their children and others.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, there you have it: people who create walking time bombs are terrorists; terrorists should be arrested; parents who don’t vaccinate should be arrested for weaponizing their children. Great.</p>

<p>However, this propagandist fails to point out, or perhaps even comprehend, that the real reason behind these deaths, though still quite tragic, is compromised immune systems – not the disease iteself. The vast majority of these deaths occur in populations who live without basic conditions of clean water, sanitation and sufficient levels of essential vitamins in their diet.</p>

<p>Like the flu, it tends to kill those who already have weakened or underdeveloped defenses against illness.</p>

<p>Measles poses relatively little risk to a healthy child. <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/doctor-explains-why-he-lets-kids-avoid-the-measles-vaccine/">Pediatrician Dr. Jay Gordon told CBS News:</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>“This measles outbreak does not pose a great risk to a healthy child,” said Dr. Gordon. “And quite frankly I don’t think it poses any risk to a healthy child.”</p>

<p>“Not meningitis, not the plague, not Ebola, they’d get measles. Measles is almost an always a benign childhood illness.“</p>

<h2>Mortality from Childhood Diseases Was Declining Before the Vaccine Arrived</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall, <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/hs/pubhealth/rosner/g8965/client_edit/readings/week_2/mckinlay.pdf">studies have shown</a> (pdf) that rising standards of living have done the most to decrease mortality from infectious disease – not vaccines.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.getholistichealth.com/39215/vaccines-did-not-save-us-2-centuries-of-official-statistics/">This chart shows</a> that while the measles vaccine, first introduced in 1963, dramatically decreased the number of measles cases, the number of deaths from measles was already in a downward spiral, thanks to general advances in reducing childhood mortality, in part due to social focus on improving nutrition and hygiene.</p>

<p>Deaths from measles declined from around 10 per 100,000 people in 1912 to around 0.25 per 100,000 in the 1960s. While the introduction of the vaccine did reduce the deaths to near zero, the trend was headed there anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://shtfplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/measlesmortalityusa1971-75_1.jpg">Chart</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prior to vaccinations, the vast majority of children who contracted measles in the United States caught the disease, endured it, built up their own bodily defenses, and recovered, often after spreading it to other children who also endured it much in the way children spread chickenpox to one another, often intentionally.</p>

<p>Today there are vaccines for these diseases and more, with plans to roll out vaccines for every conceivable disease under the sun or in the known galaxy. Many parents, doctors and advocates have argued there are now simply too many vaccinations on the schedule for most children to handle, increasing the risk of side effects. </p>

<p>Some 30 rounds of vaccines (plus an annual flu shot) are <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch-0-6yrs.pdf">recommended by the CDC</a> (pdf) in a child’s first six years of life.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Side Effects of Vaccines Outweigh the Dangers of the Disease?</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>But as the number of cases as well as deaths shrunk, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm#mmr">the admitted risk of side effects from the vaccines themselves have overshadowed the risk of the disease.</a></p>

<p>Hence, many parents have opted out of them, based on a mix of supporting data, precautionary apprehension and, of course, word-of-mouth rumors.</p>

<p>After all, it was the MMR shot – the vaccination for measles mumps and rubella that started the whole “anti-vax” affair – prompting significant numbers of parents to opt out of vaccines for their children en masse, and inadvertently triggering panic in the powers-that-be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/102375852#.">Undoubtedly the Disneyland measles outbreak</a> is being used by the media not only <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/28/health/measles-antivaxxers/">to demonize parents who choose not to vaccinate,</a> but to shame and intimidate them as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The media will no doubt point out the many well meaning parents who believed the “rumors” about the MMR vaccine jab being linked with autism – stirred up by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR_vaccine_controversy">the research of Dr. Wakefield</a>, who was accused of fraud and stripped of his medical license.</p>

<p>But the media will probably NOT be pointing out <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/046535_MMR_vaccines_autism_CDC_whistleblower.html">the revelations of the CDC whistleblower</a> who just admitted that the massive study conducted by the CDC to especially to counter the alleged link between MMR and autism <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/lawrence-solomon/merck-whistleblowers_b_5881914.html">was itself fraudulent, and fudged the data to hide increases in autism risk tied to certain statistical populations.</a> Lawsuits have since been filed.</p>

<p>Few have heard the leaked audio of the same CDC whistleblower discussing research linking “tics” linked to mercury in vaccines, noting that he would personally NEVER give his own pregnant wife a flu shot (which contains mercury as the preservative thimerosal). Doctors, however, recommend that pregnant women receive the shot.</p>

<p>But for the masses, those are just background issues most will never even be aware of.</p>

<p>The drumbeat is mounting for a new push to legitimize vaccinations, and recoup the profits that have been lost to falling vaccination rates and, as usual, by scaring up an issue.</p>

<p>God help us. Society is made up of sheep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny because I&#39;m not vaccinated for anything -- I got a tetanus shot after an injury and that&#39;s it -- and I got most of the childhood diseases.</p>

<p>I get sick about once every 3-5 years. I have friends who weren&#39;t vaccinated as kids, and they hardly ever get sick either. Everyone else I know who has been vaccinated gets sick once a year, at least. They&#39;re lucky not to get the flu, even if they&#39;ve had the shot. </p>

<p>Your vaccines compromised your immune system. And now what you&#39;re experiencing with these outbreaks is secondary vaccine failure. </p>

<p>Vaccination technology itself works and is useful. But you stupid Americans (and stupid Brits) take everything too far due to greed, and now you&#39;re reaping the consequences. Nobody needs a flu shot or an MMR unless you want to wreck your body&#39;s ability to naturally fight disease. Vaccines should be reserved for special cases, like the polio vaccine when traveling abroad or a tetanus shot when injured by a metallic object. Giving MMR vaccines to infants and taking a flu shot every year is <strong>insanity</strong>. </p>

<p>Notice how the OP says &quot;Number of outbreaks&quot; and not &quot;number of cases&quot;? That&#39;s because the outbreaks are tiny. Mouse over them on that map - in 2014, there was a measles &quot;outbreak&quot; of one single person in Fort McMurray, Canada, another single case in Utah, etc. &quot;Number of outbreaks&quot; is not a meaningful statistic when it equates a single case of measles in Bumfuck Nowhere, Alberta with a 3,800-case epidemic in the Solomon Islands, a 2,500-case epidemic in Chad, or a 38,000-case epidemic in China. Each of these epidemics has more cases than every &quot;outbreak&quot; in Canada and the U.S. combined. The Solomon Islands alone had more cases of measles than the whole of North America and Europe put together.</p>

<p>I wonder why these small, isolated outbreaks in countries with high vaccination rates remain small and isolated rather than becoming a single nationwide epidemic...</p>

<p>This is beside the point, anyway, which is that &quot;number of outbreaks&quot; isn&#39;t a meaningful statistic. Number of cases? Number of cases per capita? Sure. But those don&#39;t look nearly as good for unvaccinated countries. Not to mention tiny outbreaks of like 1-5 people are much more likely to go unnoticed and unreported in Chad or Sudan than they are in Portland or Glasgow. Simply looking at the number of reported outbreaks while disregarding the number of actual cases is deceptive bullshit for a multitude of reasons.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with that. I believe common vaccines are currently extremely safe and only have a very negligible risk of adverse reactions. I believe even this tiny risk has been reduced over the last few decades by improving manufacturing process, switching from problematic preservatives, and phasing out use of a few controversial components such as thimerosal (the mercury one). </p>

<p>I respect people&#39;s right to disagree with my assessment and encourage them to research and make up their own minds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, all this hype about measles lately, and i questioned &quot;what do i know about measles?&quot;</p>

<p>So i looked into it. First, as always, wikipedia. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 out of 1000 die from measles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really? A death rate of 0.3% is causing enough fear that the &quot;general populace&quot; is advocating the passing of legislation to criminalize non-vaccination? Really?</p>

<p>So i was like, what does WHO have to say about this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The highly contagious virus is spread by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact or direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions... <em>The virus remains active and contagious in the air or on infected surfaces for up to 2 hours.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then i found this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prior to the vaccine, 3-4 million cases of measles occured in the United States each year. &lt;—True.</p>

<p>Also true, however, is that of those 3-4 million cases, only about 450 people died each year from it in the years before the vaccine....That still seems like a lot? Instead of running out to make sure your vaccinations are up to date, how about a shot of perspective instead?...In the screen shot below, I have figured out the percentage of people who died from measles of all of the measles cases back then.  0.015%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From here: <a href="http://vaxtruth.org/2012/01/measles-perspective/">http://vaxtruth.org/2012/01/measles-perspective/</a></p>

<p>So, 0.3% death rate, or 0.015% death rate, which one is more accurate?</p>

<p>So i looked further, and turns out, neither the cdc nor WHO clearly defines the average death rate per measles case. </p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>Further analysis showed me that measles isnt <em>THAT</em> deadly.</p>

<p>Okay, cherry picking statistics, incredulous sources, whatever the argument against whst im about to say may be warranted. But nothing can really stop the People from asking this one...</p>

<p>Does legislation need to be mandated and do threats of incarceration need to be presented to innoculate our children against a disease that really doesnt cause as many deaths as, say, the fucking flu?</p>

<p>Really? Or am i missing some incredibke citations that both the CDC and WHO conviently omit from their websites concerning the actual death rates from measles? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some tl;dr results from a little [laymen Wiki researching] I did based on this:</p>

<p>The measles virus used in the MMR vaccine, is grew from the same strain that has been long adapted to strive in hen eggs, but are known to be extremely weak in the human body.</p>

<p>The main Polio vaccine was killed with Formaldehyde, which is later washed away leaving the inactivated virus for your immune system to learn. But the small traces of Formaldehyde still get boasted as a potential concern.</p>

<p>The Oral Polio vaccine is a special strain of Polio that was mutated using a special technique. This mutated Polio strain is quite understood to be more effective, but have some side effect that could, in a generic and overly-simplistic way, be interpreted as spreading Polio. That is why Oral Polio vaccines are/where only used in areas where live Polio is common. As the population no longer contains live Polio, the Oral Polio vaccine&#39;s risk to benefit balance becomes less favorable and the inactivated Polio vaccine is favoured.</p>
