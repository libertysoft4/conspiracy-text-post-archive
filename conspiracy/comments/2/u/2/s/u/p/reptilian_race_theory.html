    <div class="md"><p>It may be, but the way he presented it very much gave the impression that it wasn&#39;t a metaphor. But maybe that&#39;s what he&#39;s doing to protect himself. He even goes into stories about epiphanies and astral projection and stuff like that.</p>

<p>For the record the one I read was The Perception Deception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that he believes. Who am I to judge. His back story shows how he went from sportscaster to where he is now. He didn&#39;t choose to become aware of what he believes to be the truth. Its a very interesting story. </p>

<p>Look up his interview with Jimmy Church on Fade to Black last year.</p>

<p>I think regardless of how right or wrong he is he has good intentions. He was definitely right about the pedo stuff. We may never find out if he is right about the reptilians or if he has just been misled by negative entities on a quest to discredit him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he is confused with his &quot;visions&quot; that he bases everything from. We all have a &quot;reptilian&quot; brain, it controls flight or fight response. It&#39;s what takes over in a blinding fit of rage and tells you to kill or be killed. </p>

<p>People that allow their reptilian brain to control their emotions seem to make it into positions of power, naturally. I think in a very convoluted way, that is what he is saying. </p>

<p>Not that they are necessarily shape shifting reptilians, but allow their reptilian brain to control their decision making, which generally always is in one&#39;s own self interest.  </p>

<p>He has so much to say about that one subject and has done so much <em>research</em> on it. When David Icke refers to Zionist Israel, he is pretty open about it anyway, he doesn&#39;t pussy foot around much on the subject.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it is not in reference to Hebrew Jewish Israelites nor is it in reference to Masonic Jewish Labor Zionists. In all likelihood he does not believe in it.</p>

<p>His modus operandi is to propagate false information mixed with a bit of true information to gain a following; he works for someone - could be himself to the end of expanding his bank account or could be military intelligence.</p>

<p>Besides this utterly absurd reptile/annunaki disinformation (which by the way he largely ripped off from Zecharia Sitchin, whose translations of ancient Sumerian tablets are dismissed by all other experts on Sumerian language as being completely inaccurate), it is easy to tell Icke&#39;s work is disingenuous as is evidenced by his omission of the verifiable global rulers - the group that has historically been banned from over 80 countries, has fomented wars, assassinations and national subversion, founded the intelligence communities and the Bilderberg group and other roundtable groups, oversees presidents, prime ministers and heads of State, are masters of class warfare, control all economies and banks including the federal reserve, and control mainstream as well as much of the alternative media. There is no excuse for him to have a gap as big as that in his resume and the reptile disinformation only adds more confirmation that he is a charlatan.</p>
