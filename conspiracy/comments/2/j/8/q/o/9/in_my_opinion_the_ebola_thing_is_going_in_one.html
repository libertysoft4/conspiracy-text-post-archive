        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>They like the shock-and-awe aspect of doing things. Blindsiding people, entire populations. Their primary and most useful weapon, the media.</p>

<p>So, all we&#39;ve been hearing nonstop is about how Ebola is not airborne, not airborne, not airborne. Now they&#39;re changing it up just slightly. Ebola is not airborne, but aerosolized droplets are. They put that <em>fear</em> out there, get it in people&#39;s brains.</p>

<p><em>&quot;O gasp, what if...?&quot;</em></p>

<p>Now that slime Frieden is saying we must &quot;re-evaluate&quot; the disease or some such bullshit. Keep the population on its toes.</p>

<p><em>&quot;O what will they ever say...?&quot;</em></p>

<p>They&#39;re going to announce Ebola is airborne. Whether its true or not, well there are many on both sides of the fence on this issue. I personally believe that Ebola is real, and that the Media is acting at the behest of TPTB to blow it up into a scare far beyond what it actually is. But the important thing, is they&#39;re going to declare it airborne.</p>

<p>Right around the same time, after they&#39;ve let the panic really get seated in people, they are going to announce the vaccine.</p>

<p>The creators of this show will be <em>crushed</em> with money. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s all it is. Are people actually dying? Yes. Is Ebola real? Yes. Is the <em>threat</em> to 300,000,000+ Americans that grave? No.</p>

<p>But please remember, legal and illegal, moral, ethical-- these terms don&#39;t apply to TPTB. Doable, profitable...those are words in their dictionary. We are containers of money to them. We do the work, we earn the money, so they can take it, which is easier than earning. As individuals we might not have much, but as livestock we are the greatest, most profitable resource they could ever farm. We are farmed for cash. From birth to death. With less going to college and getting farmed in that scam, more people turning to self-sustainment, even if in only small doses, the haul is getting smaller. Like in the mafia, the envelopes are getting thinner, lighter. </p>

<p>This is only about money. And I think they&#39;re going to make those who understand this and refuse pay, and pay dearly, with planned ridicule and plotted ostracization.</p>

<p>Just my two cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can tell you&#39;ve really given this some thought and you make interesting, reflectful points; the weakest point of your argument, it strikes me (though I&#39;m no monetary or economic expert), is your reiteration that this is all about money (which of course they print and essentially gift to banks seemingly ad infinitum). My take is that it&#39;s about keeping Americans and the rest of the first world submissive and cowed before the most frightening threat of all: individualized, personal, and most painful annihilation--the equivalent of Winston&#39;s (protagonist of &#39;1984&#39;) fear of having his face gnawed off by hungry rats. After such a prospect he became quite docile for the rest of his life, cannot this fear be virtually induced on a massive scale through the constant dissemination of the threat of such an almost extraterrestrially horrendous virus? For what ends? The classic ones: those of continued, expanding oligarchic hegemony.</p>

I agree that it&#39;s about the vaccine, but we can only speculate at the part the vaccine will play in the grand scheme of things. I suspect one of the milestones they wish to accomplish is forced vaccinations, or at least a state of panic where individuals who refuse the vaccine will face severe sanctions and persecution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is all a ploy to get at Liberia&#39;s natural resources. I&#39;ll point to the way the effected West African zone is being divided up between imperialist powers. There&#39;s also the 3k-4k combat troops, aka boots on the ground, not enforcing a quarantine or restricting travel, assisting doctors but not interacting with patients, odd.  Then also the fact that there has been very few images coming out of the effected area. I still haven&#39;t seen anyone displaying the symptoms of ebola, no bleeding from the eyes or shitting and puking bile. You would think there would be at least some photos but there really isn&#39;t. A lot of the photos of supposed victims lack these symptoms. And also how did the virus end up in West Africa when it has only ever been observed in Central Africa? And how come the people in the region are so skeptical? I mean if people in your neighborhood were dying of ebola would you need to be told twice to keep your hands off of dead bodies  that had just evacuated all their internal organs through every opening?</p>

<p>The whole thing is sketchy and I&#39;m not buying it, there are just so many questions with the official story/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could be about money more than you think. Price the antidote at the medium family savings and you can kill off people holding debt.</p>

<p>It&#39;s horrific but if the population no longer owes anything, they then can reset the economy. If you believe the conspiracies, it&#39;s apparently been planned by the UN aboard ships in international waters and was set in action around ~2000 to occur in 2015. The next US president will introduce the new economy. </p>

<p>The plan is to remove the central bankers from power so they cannot recall the debt in attempt to own the planet. These bankers hide behind a secret space program which broke away after the moon landing and will slowly be exposed including their technology.</p>

<p>Probably wont happen but it isn&#39;t the most crazy theory here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think all of the theme in this forum to minimize the impact of Ebola is either ignorant, or financial industry propaganda to keep the U.S stock market from going further down the tubes.</p>

<p>Ebola is a <em>virus</em>. It thrives on living in a host environment, it&#39;s not a bacteria based disease, like so many infections that occur through the U.S. It works like a fast acting cancer, save for the fact you can catch it via contact and it spreads pretty much like the flu does.</p>

<p>For sure there are strains that have been man made, and for sure there have been studies to weaponize it. That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a problem though, it makes the likeliness of a real clusterfuck much greater.</p>

<p>It is accurate, descriptive. No more no less.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like, or use the term &quot;Illuminati&quot; as I feel it ascribes way more mythical power to what are nothing more than rich ghouls but still humans like the rest of us. As Dutch said-- if it bleeds, we can kill it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Strange, I believe the opposite. Whilst with Bird flu and other dramas they hyped it up so much that I just knew it was BS, they [TPTB] seem to downplay Ebola too much for me to think this is just another &#39;harmless&#39; stunt. 
Usually I laugh things like this off and get about my day but there is something different about Ebola. </p>

<p>It&#39;s much more reassuring to have a bunch of guys in suits in control, as evil as you may posit them to be, than to have Mother Nature in control.</p>

<p>The guys in suits can be negotiated with.</p>
