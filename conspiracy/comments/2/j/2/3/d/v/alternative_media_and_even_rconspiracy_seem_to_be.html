    <div class="md"><p>I guess you could say that I am guilty of embracing the &quot;fear porn&quot;, but here&#39;s the way I see it:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Unique event:</strong> This Ebola outbreak is by far <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ebola_outbreaks#List_of_outbreaks">the most wide-spread and deadly in history</a>, with <strong>20 times</strong> as many persons being infected than in any previous outbreak - and <em>so far</em> it has spread to 5 countries, whereas previous outbreaks affected only one or two.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The doubling rate</strong>: <a href="http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/national/containing-ebola-what-it-would-take/1366/">According to a Washington Post article</a> of October 9, there are now approximately 10-15 thousand people affected. Their predictions show that in one month that figure may triple, and in two months that figure will double again to over 100,000. According to the Washington Post article, one CDC report issued in September said that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/the-ominous-math-of-the-ebola-epidemic/2014/10/09/3cad9e76-4fb2-11e4-8c24-487e92bc997b_story.html">&quot;at current rates of infection, as many as 1.4 million people would become infected by January.&quot;</a> And they were only talking about Africa.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Early symptoms</strong> are minor (<a href="http://www.md-health.com/images/10900011/ebola-symptoms.jpg">headache, fatigue, muscle soreness, fever</a>), and would likely be dismissed as a cold or flu. During this time - 2-3 days, the subject <em>is contagious</em>, but would likely be unaware that they are infected, and carry on with normal activities, unwittingly infecting others.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Easily transmissible</strong>: While it may not be airborne, Ebola is not AIDS. You don&#39;t need to share a needle or have sex with someone to catch it. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/environmental-infection-control-in-hospitals.html">According to the CDC</a> &quot;Limited laboratory studies under favorable conditions indicate that <strong>Ebolavirus can remain viable on solid surfaces, with concentrations falling slowly over several days</strong>.&quot; This means that handling door knobs, elevator buttons, handrails, shopping carts, fresh produce and other items could well transmit the disease.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Failure to take precautions</strong>: This one troubles me the most, as it would appear that the officials charged with safeguarding our health actually WANT this disease to spread to Western nations. In this type of epidemic, the most effective method of control is <strong>containment</strong>. Indeed, Nigeria has declared itself &quot;Ebola free&quot; after taking a variety of measures - the most important being <strong>limiting travel to and from affected areas</strong>. Neither the US or any European countries have done this - they are allowing persons from infected regions to enter freely - the &quot;precautions&quot; they are currently employing in the US (asking questions and checking for fever) are effectively worthless, as they rely on honest answers, and the travelers may not even know that they are infected. Furthermore, those infected will not show a fever until they are contagious - and the incubation period can be up to 21 days <em>or longer</em> - meaning an infected person could be in the US for 2 weeks - apparently healthy - until symptoms show.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is not the flu. This outbreak is killing 70% of those who catch it. Infection rates in Africa are doubling every month, and the US is a much more highly mobile nation than those in West Africa, so here it would have the advantage of &quot;starting&quot; in multiple locations, coast to coast, potentially infecting thousands in very short order, and growing exponentially beyond that.</p>

<p>The fact that this is being downplayed by the CDC while they and the State Department willfully allow the country to be flooded by potential carriers arriving from hot-spots is scandalous. </p>

<p>Finally, consider what would happen if Ebola DID take firm root in the US this winter, during the height of cold and flu season. What would happen if thousands or tens of thousands of people - coast to coast - became infected? What actions would our wonderful leaders take THEN?</p>

<p>Yeah. I think about that shit. If you want to call it &quot;fear porn&quot;, fine.</p>

<p>Now, do me a favor and tell me that I&#39;m wrong - and back it up with cited facts. Because believe me, I would LOVE to be wrong.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>An airborne disease is any disease that is caused by pathogens and transmitted through the air. Such diseases include many that are of considerable importance both in human and veterinary medicine. The relevant pathogens may be viruses, bacteria, or fungi, and they may be <strong>spread through coughing, sneezing, raising of dust, spraying of liquids, or similar activities likely to generate aerosol particles or droplets.</strong> Strictly speaking airborne diseases do not include conditions caused simply by air pollution such as dusts and poisons, though their study and prevention may be related.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering that the Dallas hospital is effectively closed now from treating just one patient, I feel we should be a bit more alarmed. I don&#39;t believe we are preparing in the right way, just fear mongering hoping for a solution to present itself. </p>

<p>69 different personnel were a part of the Liberian patients treatment and now many are not coming to work for fear that they may also have caught it... No patients want to go to be treated at that hospital... No staff leaves other public health facilities to domino in a similar fashion until the system is crumpled. Imagine a total outbreak compared to what we are seeing in Africa. Something like 51% or more of the healthcare workers in Liberia are now dead or have contracted the disease. Our hospitals would become immobilized rapidly, yet this is not the focus of the news cycle. Nobody wants a panic. </p>

<p>We need to come up with new procedures, not many ERs are prepared for the kind of Decon necessary to handle a full scale outbreak leaving only governmental response and potential martial law. The biggest issue I see over there is lack of cultural awareness or ability to mobilize a majority of their population. We are not nearly prepared to do much better on a municipal or state level.  With early mobilization we can stop just about anything. I believe it would be possible to prepare locally across America but it needs to start ASAP otherwise this is all looking like one big storm of bad news.  </p>

<p>We are lead on to believe our all powerful government and &quot;1st world&quot; healthcare system can save us and the disease will not come soon. We need to wake up. </p>

<p>Are you saying that &quot;a simple flu&quot; kills more that 70% of those infected? </p>

<p>Naw, you can&#39;t be saying that. Even the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_flu_pandemic">1918 flu pandemic</a> killed only 10 - 20% of those infected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate when people bring up this argument...swine flu, SARS and bird flu were plastered all over the news but the cases of those infected and total deaths never came close to touching where Ebola is right now, and Ebola&#39;s only exploding more and more at a really disturbing rate.</p>

<p>I can understand your argument that MSM tries to keep us in fear over deadly diseases from time to time, but you can&#39;t just count out ebola because those past scares ended up being nothing. Ebola has already infected and killed more than all those past diseases combined</p>

<p>Ebola isn&#39;t even remotely comparable to the other three, in terms of death rate.  Every time an Ebola outbreak occurs, 50 - 90% of infected people die.  </p>

<p>Granted, it <em>is</em> in Africa, but it&#39;s not as if there isn&#39;t any medical care there.  </p>

Keep in mind this is not a US thing. It&#39;s an African thing with news teams from all over the world reporting things.
Now I&#39;m all for being sceptical but to assume that the human tragedy that is happening in Liberia and the four other countries has been fabricated in order to do X with the American people is both arrogant and extremely cynical. In fact it would be the sickest and most perverted form of American exceptionalism that I&#39;ve seen so far.</p>

<p>Wanna quote where I said that?  What I did say (or imply) is that the MSM are known liars.  Why would we take them at their word when their word is all we have that says this outbreak is occurring and is a huge deal?</p>

<p>Many people in Liberia think the entire thing is a hoax and have been saying so.  I&#39;m not saying for sure one way or the other but my mind is open at least to the possibility - what proof is there that the outbreak is as bad as we&#39;re being told?  Are there any pictures of a victim or body?</p>

<p>Did you know that there&#39;s a campaign going on in Africa to convince people it&#39;s real?  As in huge signs that say &quot;Ebola is real&quot; are being hung up everywhere.  Seems pretty sketchy to me.</p>

Look mate, being critical or sceptical is one thing. But assuming that some sinister force coming up with a conspiracy involving so many people from so many different countries is just going way too deep down the rabbit hole.
As I said in another comment above the Liberian populace on average is on the educational level of the early middle ages.

    <div class="md"><p>At this point you&#39;d have to define what you mean by evidence. A quick image search shows quite a few pictures of bodies. They are of course covered up or in body bags.
Is that enough? </p>

<p>Would seeing a &quot;full&quot; dead body be enough? Or would you need its name, ID, and a copy of the medical history suffice?</p>

<p>Or would you need a doctor standing next to it with a sign saying &quot;Ebola did it&quot; be enough? Would you need the name, nationality, tax returns and longform birth certificate be enough four you to believe him?</p>

<p>Is it enough when hundreds of aid workers, doctors and nurses say: yep, definitely Ebola?</p>

<p>How many medical personnel have to die before you accept a simple fact? Currently I think the number is 90. Would 100 suffice? 1000? </p>

<p>What about the missionaries that died? Is the church in on this, too?</p>

<p>That Spanish nurse, is she a government shill?</p>

<p>The 2 patients in Germany&#39;s best hospitals, fake?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to be condescending here. Im just truly flabbergasted that you are even remotely considering that a humanitarian crisis on this level and with so many different countries involved would be fake or a false flag or whatever you think it is or could be.</p>

<p>You say you are keeping an open mind and I applaude that but an open mind without critical and analytical thinking is just empty space.</p>

<p>What I <em>have</em> seen is a whole lot of fuckery and fear mongering regarding the entire subject.  Enough so for me to remain skeptical of the MSM story.</p>

<p>Put it this way: in my mind, if it were truly as bad an outbreak as the MSM is telling us, there should be hundreds of pieces of evidence to support that fact.  Instead I see a whole bunch of questions and a whole lot of confusion and contradictory information.  I need more to go on than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s a matter of perspective or each of our &quot;bubbles&quot;.
Correct me if I&#39;m wrong but I assume you live in the USA.</p>

<p>Your media sucks ass. Most of it is opinionated and follows or at least supports a political agenda. Then you have CNN who nowadays think that journalistic integrity means saying &quot;X said the moon is made of cheese, some agree but others don&#39;t&quot;.</p>

<p>You&#39;re obviously not buying any of that crap - which is great. Or at least you are sceptical. But you&#39;re almost too far gone mate. You distrust EVERYTHING - and that&#39;s neither critical nor smart nor healthy.
Not blaming you here - just making an observation with a few assumptions. I&#39;d still rather talk to people like you than the ones that have given up on criritical thinking alltogether or never started. </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m German. We still have a few outlets - most importantly our public TV channels (under civil oversight) and publications like Der Spiegel (who constantly clashed and clash with the goverment). Sources like Fox and MSNBC look like comedy to us. This would never be taken seriously by anybody here and they&#39;d be run out of town real fast. 
In not saying we don&#39;t have yellow press here - but everybody recognizes them as such and uses them more as a source if comedy than news.</p>

<p>So if a team of Spiegel journalists travels to Nigeria, talk to locals, officials and medical experts I have little to no reason not to believe them. They are nothing without their integrity and they know that. Hell, its only been a few decades that the government raided their offices and arrested journalists. 
They - as well as the rest of the journalisticly integer channels - have a pretty good track record.</p>

<p>Basically: US MSM has little to no journalistic integrity left, is business driven and or part of the political spectrum. 24h news cycle is not helping either.
German media are incredibly different from that and channels like Fox and MSNBC woulb be sued out of business here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right here. Not once have you seen pictures (in the US at least) of Ebola here. Ebola is a hemorrhagic by nature, with fatalities stemming from a combination of coagulation (blood clotting) issues and bleeding from internal organs and bodily orifices. Have you seen that? Or has it just been <em>reported</em> that Ebola is here and a patient died?</p>

<p>If you watched the ISIS videos and saw the hypocrisy with how they reported it (considering they never showed actual beheadings...), this situation seems eerily similar.</p>

<p>Both events are either being almost completely manufactured by the media (or hyped to death because fear sells and scared citizens will agree to see crazy shit. Last time we agreed to take our shoes and belts off and get felt up by high school dropouts at airports for security theater, as well as numerous other injustices.</p>

<p>I wonder what the public will demand this time?</p>

<p>Remember: the US has a <strong>patent</strong> for Ebola:</p>

<p>Maybe they would. That&#39;s the price you pay when you report these things. Some of us still need <em>proof</em>.</p>

<p>And this is a negative thing? There are numerous inconsistencies with SH - you&#39;re hanging out on r/con, you know this. And no, I don&#39;t need to see dead kids in SH crime scene photos (although it would be nice to have that option should people choose to personally require that level of proof), but reporting at least the 26 murders in their 2012 annual report would be nice. They didn&#39;t even do that (according to the FBI...):</p>

<p>They did. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As with most State Police, “crime statistics” end up in the purview of the COUNTY in which the incident occurred. In this case, that would be Fairfield County. To be blunt, Newtown didn’t “take the hit” of so many murders. The county of Fairfield took them on their stats, which show a total of 34 murders for 2012.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an avid conspiracy follower and skeptic I can give you my honest perspective. When you have been following all of the &quot;little&quot; and &quot;big&quot; conspiracy stories over the last 20 years or so it gets easier to recognize the patterns, but it also gets easier to put the puzzle pieces in place as the image becomes clear with each bit. While I do recognize the tried and true tactics and protocols in place here, I also see how it could fit into the &#39;end game&#39; plans. From laws in place, predictive programing, following the money, to the controlled media coverage. So, yes, I agree we can see something here that didn&#39;t just naturally appear out of nowhere, my guarded concern comes because of how this piece so neatly fits into the last few open spaces in the &#39;big picture&#39;. All out war on the masses would meet with rebellion in any other circumstance, a &#39;controlled&#39; pandemic truly is the only reasonable method of ensuring compliance and achieving all set goals. So while panic and unbridled fear are never a solution to a problem, neither is denial or hubris. Tempered precaution, and a wide-set scope are required in all intellectual endeavors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The MSM didn&#39;t give a fuck about Ebola until those two volunteers were flown to Atlanta for treatment. I&#39;ve been reading about this outbreak since February. By the end of March it had spread to three countries and had appeared in urban centers and MSF referred to the spread as unprecedented. But nobody really cared. You know why? Because the so called U.S. national interests aren&#39;t at stake in Liberia or Sierra Leone. Even currently, media coverage is very lopsided and focuses pretty narrowly on the prospects of a larger Ebola outbreak in the U.S., when the real story that demands attention is still in West Africa where the number of infected doubles every 20 days.</p>

<p>edit: (additional thoughts) - Is the media fear mongering? I mean, to a certain extent, fear mongering is just routine for the mass media, something they do indiscriminately, simply by their nature, not necessarily (although sometimes) in active service of a particular agenda.</p>

The best news I&#39;ve seen is that there have not been many secondary cases in Dallas.  The rest of the news in relation to this has usually been escalating worsely. I&#39;d argue, and have a great deal, that the best way to neutralize the threat is to get rid of the threat.  I&#39;m still in support of this argument.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s one.  People: we all <em>know</em> that the MSM is literally propaganda.  Why, then, is anyone taking their word for it when it comes to this &quot;outbreak&quot; when they&#39;re so obviously fear-mongering?  I&#39;m not saying the whole thing is <em>definitely</em> a hoax or anything like that but I am saying that it&#39;s possible.</p>

<p>Wanna quote where I said that?  What I did say (or imply) is that the MSM are known liars.  Why would we take them at their word when their word is all we have that says this outbreak is occurring and is a huge deal?</p>

<p>Many people in Liberia think the entire thing is a hoax and have been saying so.

<p>Did you know that there&#39;s a campaign going on in Africa to convince people it&#39;s real?  As in huge signs that say &quot;Ebola is real&quot; are being hung up everywhere.  Seems pretty sketchy to me.</p>
