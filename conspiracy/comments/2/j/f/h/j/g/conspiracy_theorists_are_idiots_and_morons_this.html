<p>Snowden leaks and confirms CT&#39;s big brother suspicions (Snowden gets punished)</p>

<p>Carmen Segarra basically proves what we already suspected about the FED. (gets fired)</p>

<p>We continue to knock off central bank free nations.</p>

<p>Global warming has been forced to rebrand itself as global climate change (since the warming stopped)</p>

<p>We continue to &quot;spread freedom&quot; by covertly overthrowing democratically elected governments with the CIA who also happens to be the biggest drug dealer in the states, which begs the question of WHY! Are we SWATing drug dealers who don&#39;t have a fancy CIA badge while we protect drug dealers who do have a fancy badge.  Also a big bank can make 800,000,000.00 dollars laundering drug money and if they get caught they have to pay a 4 million dollar fine.  So money launderers pay a lower tax rate than I do when I buy eggs at the grocery store.</p>

<p>But I rest my case, we are all clearly the idiots...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah yes, Hitler, who denied internationalism and the global Judaism, who nationalized industries and enslaved political opponents, who wanted to expand Germany into a massive self-serving empire....was working for the illuminati? You really think that Hitler, the greatest isolationist and nationalist of all time, was working for globalization? Or are you saying that the Illuminati didn&#39;t <em>mind</em> the rise of Hitler, even though he came very, very close to dominating Europe and expelling the international banking influence.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s incredibly odd that according to this subreddit, all wars break out because of....banks? I mean, it ignores so much history, so many factors, my god, it&#39;s just such a simplistic worldview.</p>

<p>Why do you figure the illuminati let Iran nationalize, or North Korea? Wouldn&#39;t that just be more work for them in the future? Furthermore, how do you figure TBTB orchestrated a market crash, with billions of independent investors and consumers uncontrollable?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that at a certain point, the complexity of what the governments are doing may be too difficult for the average person to understand. Their reaction, in return, is to oversimplify the situation. In other words, if the complexity of a situation is too much, people who are unable to process it take the most simple route to forming an opinion rather than the more difficult, yet correct, route.</p>

<p>This is the problem with American democracy. We are tied to the irrational voter... the tyranny of the average man, if you will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been feeling this. It seems as if the complexity of the world politics situations is too much for most people, even those who are supposed to be knowledgable about it. Even journalists don&#39;t want to spend all their waking hours trying to figure out one thing from another, and with the wildly divergent accounts of what is happening coming from every nation involved, with different levels of truth and propaganda, it seems most have given up and decided to just accept the official story since to go against it is so confusing.</p>

<p>And, it&#39;s not just world politics. Technology, science, social sciences, everything, there&#39;s just so much to know that nobody feels like they&#39;re on top of anything, and that&#39;s why nobody seems to have the confidence to really comment or analyze anything, especially not holistically.</p>

<p>I have read this (or parts of it) many times over the years, and had always assumed that it was a strategy that Hitler himself embraced to control the masses he intended to rule. </p>

<p>One day I came across a longer version of the quote, in context, and suddenly it took on an entirely different meaning. Hitler was not <em>advocating</em> the use of &quot;<em>the big lie</em>&quot;, but accusing <em>others</em> of doing so.</p>

<p>Continuing the Hitler quote from where you left off:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying. These people know only too well how to use falsehood for the basest purposes. From time immemorial, however, the Jews have known better than any others how falsehood and calumny can be exploited. Is not their very existence founded on one great lie, namely, that they are a religious community, where as in reality they are a race? And what a race! One of the greatest thinkers that mankind has produced has branded the Jews for all time with a statement which is profoundly and exactly true. Schopenhauer called the Jew &quot;The Great Master of Lies&quot;. Those who do not realize the truth of that statement, or do not wish to believe it, will never be able to lend a hand in helping Truth to prevail. </p>

<p>I feel we&#39;re somewhere around stage 3 now. Not fighting in a literal sense but they are taking active measures to discredit us and flood the populace with disinfo.</p>

<p>Much like &quot;SweatyBollocks&quot; below, I&#39;ve given up trying to convince people. Now when something comes up in conversation I say what needs to be said and remind them that in a few years time they will look back and realize we were right.</p>

<p>Quoting Mattavich below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Normal people know all these things</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If by &quot;normal people&quot; you mean the general populace then you are incorrect. The general populace believes what they are told in the MSM and do not question the &#39;official&#39; story.  After all, the media and our government wouldn&#39;t lie to us just like they would never spy on us.</p>

<p>Even when you have THOUSANDS of architects and engineers, experts in their given fields, stating the twin towers could <em>not</em> have fallen at free-fall speeds given the damages they sustained without either:
a) Removing all (most) resistance between the top of the tower and the ground
or 
b) Re-writing the laws of physics
and they STILL believe the towers collapsed due to the planes hitting them and the resulting fire. </p>

<p>Thinking otherwise would be too painful a realization for many.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Vostok data shows cyclical Co2 elevation that reaches way further back into history than human kind does.  And the temperature data extrapolated doesn&#39;t correlate in the way we are lead to believe.  There are clear changes in temp without any change in Co2 and where there is a correlation its often the temp that leads the Co2.  This is part of a natural process that has been happening far longer than climate science has been trying to explain it.</p>

<p>There is valid science in regards to ecosystem change which is man made, but not global climate.  Science requires that you be able to test a theory in a controlled environment, reproduce the results and once refined predict future results based on what you&#39;ve learned.</p>

<p>Climate science is dealing our whole planet so there is not a 2nd earth with which to have a control group, and when the predicted results fail to match reality then we have climate scientist scrambling to explain away the failure (the oceans absorbed the heat we predicted).  The climate science isn&#39;t falsifiable because there is no way to know if man made green house gases are to blame for climate change or natural processes.  We KNOW that man will continue to pollute, so pollution will increase. We have no control group earth2 that we can compare earth against.  We have no way to know if the climate would change without our added pollution.</p>

<p>Except for the fact we KNOW the climate has experienced cyclical changes for millions of years, now suddenly we are attributing these changes to our pollution.</p>

<p>I&#39;m no fan of pollution, I can&#39;t imagine who would be, but we may as well attribute these changes in our climate to angry gods like our ancestors did.  There is no way to prove otherwise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right and the big bang is just a fancy replacement for &quot;let there be light&quot;.</p>

<p>The reason that they deal with the universe mere seconds after it was formed is because the mathematics their theory is based on breaks down completely as we get mere seconds away from the 1 moment that counts.</p>

<p>Let there be light, let there be a big boom, let there be.  Its all the same.</p>

<p>We surely can keep making better models with which to explain our changing climate, but there have been obviously erroneous models that have predicted things accurately before and were still wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We do know how electrons interact and this only leads to more questions. When a person observes an electron it acts like a particle, yet when unobserved it acts like a wave of light. As far as climate change goes. The climate is and has always been changing it is one thing you can bank on it will change. As far as what humans are doing to screw up the atmosphere is nothing to what nature is going to do. Yellowstone is overdue for eruption and Is more active now then ever observed. When that goes the united states grain belt will be ruined causing massive famine and the climate will change drastically. Maybe a volcano tax is the answer?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you advocate the Big Bang that means you advocate the concept of Redshift via Doppler or Redshift via Universe Expansion. This pipe-dream of Astro-photography and Astro-theology is absolute garbage to anyone properly trained in plasma physics, spectroscopy, or quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>The redshift &amp; blueshift phenomenon have nothing to do with expansion or relative motion of heavenly bodies. Redshift is a photonic quantum phenomenon. Astrophysicists are not experts in photonics or quantum mechanics and their hairbrain idea on the topic of Big Bang is nothing more than Creationism. Redshift &amp; Blueshift are both owing to the variability of the Di-electric &quot;constant&quot; in high energy sparse plasma as found in space. This has been proven countless times by world reknown quantum physicists going back to Bohr &amp; Fermi. </p>

<p>Big Bang Creationists live in a pure fantasy land. End of discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t feel like giving you a college education over reddit. Essentially though climate doesn&#39;t work that way, you can&#39;t just say &quot;it&#39;s going to get hotter&quot;. Climate at its core is a trend and there are going to be variations in the &quot;weather&quot;. See there is a distinction climate is the whole picture while weather is on the smaller more individual level. You have the two confused. Just because it is really cold one year doesn&#39;t mean the climate has changed that is simply a weather event. Whatever little &quot;AH HA! Gotcha!&quot; you have have already been thought about by scientist, which are certainly aware and take into account the sun and its cycles. We can see an accelerated trend in the data we have collected that is certainly unusual. We compare this to data taken from ice cores which archive previous atmospheres thousands of years ago on Earth. There are multiple methods scientists use to make sure all the data is consistent. This all points to the conclusion that the huge and constant release of greenhouse gases has an effect on global temperatures. Many greenhouse gases have a heating AND a cooling effect both of which can be equally bad. There are many natural buffering systems in place on Earth that help to keep climates relatively stable however once these are stressed enough, bigger changes can happen rapidly. There are a lot of things to understand and take account of, it&#39;s a very interesting and complex field.</p>

First of all none of you, as far as I know, are conspiring anything. People who question beliefs are called skeptics, why let such a loaded term as &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; be a noose around your neck?</p>

<p>Sceptic is a noun. A sceptic is someone who has doubts about things that other people believe.

    <div class="md"><p>My point exactly. The CIA came up with the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; to discredit people questioning the official narrative. Why are people who are, by the very definition of the word, skeptical of the official narrative, so eager to be labeled by a term that the very people who are concocting conspiracies coined in order to discredit any opposing point of view? I mean I know what a conspiracy is, this sub is called &quot;conspiracy&quot;, but why are people here so ready to label themselves as conspiracy theorists, it doesn&#39;t do us any good.

<p>Yes yes, I should avoid commenting until I have been baptised into the world of academic masterbation that produces climate models which fail to predict anything accurately.  Then when faced with failure I&#39;ll explain it all away by claiming the oceans absorbed my data.  </p>

<p>Do you know anything about verifying and validating climate models. How can you say they fail to predict reality when you can&#39;t name a single metric that would be used to gauge their accuracy. </p>

<p>All your saying is &quot;I don&#39;t know anything about their models, or how they are checked for accuracy, I only know that they are somehow wrong.&quot; </p>

Just like we could feel the corruption of the FED before we had any credible evidence of its corruption.  We could feel the over reach of big brother before we had credible evidence of 5 eyes or NSA domestic spying.</p>

<p>you could understand a few people just doing shilling and trolling for a hobby, but the sheer number of very well written and long hour duty shills points to organized social engineering.</p>

<p>the oddity is the number who tell lies about capital crimes, go along with the lies over 9/11 or Sandy Hook, they open themselves up to legal action down the road. &#39;accessory after the fact&#39; etc. covering up mass murder etc.</p>

<p>these people that do this have to be dumb, anybody with a brain would not put themselves into such a legal predicament. not to mention &#39;other&#39; revenge activities sometime down the road from the 3000 9/11 families that had people murdered by the criminals on 9/11.</p>

<p>you live in a bubble if you think the official story of WTC7 has not been blown out of the water.</p>

<p>both cannot be correct.</p>

<p>the NYPD took a 35mm photo on 9/11 of a non United Airlines plane flying into or near the WTC2, looks more like a 737 with smaller engines and the strange pyramid logo or lettering near the front looks very much like a fuzzy ATA, as in &#39;American Trans Air&#39; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question is: what is the definition of a normal person? </p>

<p>Does it really matter today since &quot;normal people&quot; think inside the box and won&#39;t believe anything outside the box unless a higher authority tells them. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it has to do with &quot;wanting to believe&quot;. Its like Area 51. Before that event UFO reporting was not wide spread but the person that saw it knew what he saw and described it the best he could. The mistake he made was calling the authorities which in turn changed the story and everyone believed it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The modern day world is built upon the proven scientific method. Normal people believe in evidence and dream of more adventurous possibilities. Conspiracy theorists in this subreddit believe in their dreams while ignoring credible evidence and possibilities.</p>

<p>Area 51 existing is proven as far as I know, that&#39;s why normal people now accept it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea of a conspiracy theorist is to look into things that people don&#39;t believe or don&#39;t want to believe because there is no scientific evidence backing it up. I think it&#39;s foolish to blindly believe the scientific community because we also know they have been wrong in the past.</p>

<p>Yes some people are gullible that is proven. Even normal people do not know how to do the proper research required to discover the truth. The whole idea of this website is for people to come here in learn and see what other people are doing.</p>

<p>I think today as individuals have to do more then we thought because we&#39;ve learned the normal sources of information are proven not to be accurate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is really really making me facepalm hard. </p>

<p>Science looks into ALL possibilities. If there is no evidence to suggest something, then it is not possible to identify it as a possibility.</p>

<p>Your problem seems to be that you&#39;re ignorant of what you&#39;re describing as the scientific community. The scientific method is never wrong. The scientific method allows us to make conclusions using the evidence we have and <em>nothing more</em>. If new evidence comes to light, then it will come to a new conclusion. The difference between the scientific method and believing in something is that when you hold a belief you make the choice to ignore the most probable and well supported conclusion and you choose to call your belief fact while being ignorant to evidence that supports other possibilities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh boy. This is not a debate about science but a debate on how people think or believe. All I know is that its better to discover things on your own over believing anyone at face value. </p>

<p>Everyone is not the same or will ever be on the same level of thinking. Anyone that thinks they are above someone else (because they think they are smarter) is the real fool. </p>

<p>Yes I too remember when AGW turned into AGCC because the ocean decided to eat all the warming that was predicted.  That&#39;s okay though because consensus has become science so they still aren&#39;t wrong.  Right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that at a certain point, the complexity of what the governments are doing may be too difficult for the average person to understand. Their reaction, in return, is to oversimplify the situation. In other words, if the complexity of a situation is too much, people who are unable to process it take the most simple route to forming an opinion rather than the more difficult, yet correct, route.</p>

<p>This is the problem with American democracy. We are tied to the irrational voter... the tyranny of the average man, if you will.</p>

<p>If we understand that you can not teach a monkey calculus, why are we forced to be subjected to the whim of the average person with the expectation that they should understand global politics?</p>

<p>Yes yes, I should avoid commenting until I have been baptised into the world of academic masterbation that produces climate models which fail to predict anything accurately.  Then when faced with failure I&#39;ll explain it all away by claiming the oceans absorbed my data.  </p>
