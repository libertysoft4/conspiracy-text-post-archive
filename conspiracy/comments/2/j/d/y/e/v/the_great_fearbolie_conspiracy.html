        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Problem, reaction, solution.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create the <strong>problem</strong> and the need for a vaccine through fear mongering propaganda.</li>
<li>Expect the <strong>reaction</strong>: Make people demand the vaccine &quot;or we will die!!!&quot;</li>
<li>Deliver the <strong>solution</strong> -  the vaccine they will be begging for. The vaccine will not cure Ebola because you never had it in the first place. What will kill you is the vaccine itself. </li>
</ol>

<p>Hook, line and sinker. It works every time.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Ebola is not the threat, the vaccine is.</p>

<p><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/11/world/africa/liberia-ebola-us-mission/index.html">US Army troops</a> who were recently sent to Africa to contend with the Ebola threat are to be &quot;exposed&quot; to this Ebola virus, and these troops will be injected with the a new experimental Ebola vaccine. (<a href="https://jhaines6.wordpress.com/2014/10/14/ebolagate-us-marines-being-used-as-patsies-as-elite-activate-next-stage-of-flu-to-coup-plan/">Even soldiers at home are guinea pigs for mandatory vaccines.</a>)</p>

<p>The anti-Ebola vaccine will be given to these US soldiers in Africa, and this vaccine will also <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2014/10/ebola-very-crafty-false-flag-vaccination-blackmail-3045292.html">contain a &quot;trigger&quot; element.</a></p>

<p>The soldiers will come home and many of them will be discharged and they will be dispersed to all areas of the United States.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <strong>fear propaganda will make the rest of the population <em>demand</em> a vaccine to &quot;contain the contagion&quot;.</strong> People will line up to get their death sentence.</p>

<p>Pathogens will later be released into the atmosphere around August 2016, perhaps in chemtrails  and/or in ground releases, such as in the subway systems of major cities. The latter plot has already been perpetrated in the New York City subway system when they released the Serratia Marcescens bacteria, which was encapsulated in light bulbs and tossed into the subways. This diabolical plot is documented in the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clouds-Secrecy-Armys-Warfare-Populated/dp/082263001X">CLOUDS OF SECRECY</a>, by Prof. Leonard Cole of Rutgers University.</p>

<p><strong>The vaccine and pathogen release will be spaced far apart so you won&#39;t make the connection.</strong></p>

<p>Another reason the pathogen will be released later is so that the criminals in charge of this genocide won&#39;t be at risk from an unpredictable epidemic which they have no control over. Having a date set will give them the time they need to &quot;run for the hills&quot; or get into their Deep Underground Military Bases( D.U.M.Bs) until the dust settles.</p>

<p>The trigger element planted in the vaccines will then &quot;recombine&quot; in their bodies with the pathogen that is to be released. This will make you zombie-like (understand the Hollywood obsession with zombies lately?).</p>

<p>The product of this recombination of the pathogen and the trigger element <strong>will result in a deadly biological weapon of mass extermination</strong>, calculated and designed to go airborne and thus, to be highly contagious.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>THE BIOCHIP, SAVIOR OF MANKIND: The end of privacy and free-will.</strong> Ebola cure, cashless society, drug delivery, pacification of the masses, and GPS tracker all in one convenient package. This is what they will have in store for those who survive the New Ebola.</p>

<p>The New Ebola caused by the vaccine will be spread through the air and physical contact. There will be a push for a cashless society to prevent contagion by passing on paper money, so the chip will be introduced (Mark of the Beast, anyone?) for buying and selling.</p>

<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5066890/implanted-microchip-will-monitor-your-health-deliver-drugs-from-under-your-skin">The chip will also be pushed by claiming to cure the New Ebola with a drug delivery system and take care of your health.</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MuXgpl2Sxg#t=80">The FunVax</a> agent can also be periodically applied which will literally take away your free will, making you completely obedient.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2014/10/get-ready-for-biosurveillance-of-your.html">Yes, even your children will be used against you.</a> &quot;Think about the children!&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>A Batman comic from 1996, foretelling in a symbolic story line, this same genocidal plot for mass extermination. In the comic, the flu vaccine contains the trigger element which and when injected into thousands of victimized vectors, will recombine within the bodies of some of these vectors to make the lethal-but-non-contagious virus (to be released) which will become an airborne mutant of that virus.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/6/4/5773268/children-migration-central-america-texas-unaccompanied-alien-children-border-crisis">The recent ushering in of thousands of children from Central America across the Texas border</a> near San Antonio is a part of this very same plot that is being perpetrated against the U.S. soldiers. The immigrants are being handled by FEMA, who will most likely make them take the vaccine for &quot;safety purposes&quot;.</p>

<p>Reporters have confirmed that the <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-Texas/2014/08/07/Feds-Bend-CDC-Rules-for-Sick-Illegal-Immigrants">CDC is spearheading an unprecedented roundup of illegal Mexicans</a>, who are exhibiting flu-like symptoms. After vaccinating the immigrants will be released to populate the 4 corners of the USA.</p>

<p>When the time comes, the pathogen will be released, triggering the New Ebola, which will be airborne and highly contagious. This will generate an epidemic never seen before, making whole cities go into Martial Law or <a href="http://www.redflagnews.com/headlines/ebola-camps-fox-analyst-calls-for-quarantine-camps-in-every-city">moving large quantities of people into the FEMA camps for quarantine</a>.</p>

<p>This plan is set to take place in 2016, after <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/047251_Ebola_vaccine_NIH_pharmaceutical_companies.html">everyone has been vaccinated</a> and forgot about this whole Ebola issue. The important thing now is to get people vaccinated. That&#39;s all.</p>

<p>The Georgia Guidestones&#39; first &quot;Commandment&quot;:  <strong>Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://vanshardware.com/2014/10/anonymous-message-claims-to-reveal-r-c-christian-identity-georgia-guidestones-doom-date/">The Guidestones&#39; cube sets the date for this Judgement of Mankind</a> and Ebola will do just that. The other 9 Commandments are directed at who survives.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus: <a href="http://www.jimstonefreelance.com/ebolie.html">Just like 9/11, this is also about invading countries for OIL.</a></strong> Ebola is Obama&#39;s &quot;terrorists&quot;. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Options: 
You disregard this manufactured crisis, avoid the antivirus and get on with your life, hoping you won&#39;t get stuck in a quarantined zone under Martial Law &quot;for your safety&quot;.</p>

<p>If that happens, you&#39;re screwed either way because they&#39;ll force you to take the vaccine, game over. The only solution is to get out of the city when the media begins reporting on how &quot;out of control it is&quot;, or leave the country all together when they start enacting Martial Law across the country.</p>

<p>About those &quot;lists&quot;, they&#39;ll be going through those with a fine toothed comb to eliminate all dissent and resistance, and to remove all firearms from quarantined locations &quot;for your safety&quot;, again.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/06/25/dick-cheney-predicts-attack-this-decade-far-deadlier-than-911/">Authorities are saying an attack bigger than 9/11 is coming</a> so &quot;solutions&quot; bigger than the Patriot Act will be passed and enforced. All remaining liberties will be gone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made this comment 2 months ago when the ebola fear was still young: </p>

<p>Read this on a blog in reference v to the Ebola outbreak:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to introduce you to TEKMIRA, a pharmaceutical company that is a self-proclaimed world leader in RNA interference (RNAi) delivery technology via nanotechnology.  INTERPRETATION:  genetic manipulation using nanotechnology.  Why am I telling you this?  Would it raise any suspicions on your part to know that TEKMIRA just received a $1.5 million cash contribution from Monsanto?  Or that one of their partners is Bristol-Meyers Squibb?  Or that this same pharmaceutical company also received a $140 million contract from the Department of Defense, and was granted a Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the development of its vaccine TKM-Ebola</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TL; DR: mansato and the DoD, have paid a genetic altering nanotechnology company to develop a vaccine for this &quot;outbreak&quot; I wouldnt be surprised for some new strain of Ebola to blow up in the states, allowing the government to force administer a vaccine that has nanotechnology piggy backing on the top of it. They are essentially generating fear unitl it reaches an apex, where everyone is walking aound with mask and gloves, then they will introduce this vaccine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are off the deep end man. This is a hypothesis, not a theory. A theory is based in fact and source. You just pull stuff out of your ass, and are somehow convinced of it, or like to write bullshit and post it here.</p>
