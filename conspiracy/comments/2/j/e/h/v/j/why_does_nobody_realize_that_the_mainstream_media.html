<p>I am not saying that they don&#39;t deserve to be hated. But why are we jumping at the opportunity to spread their message for them at every possible turn?</p>

<p>Knowing what <em>actual</em> history has taught me of the US government/CIA and their tactics, if ISIS were actually a threat, then the opposite should have happened:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>media silence or distractions to intentionally keep news of ISIS out of the mainstream</p></li>
<li><p>CIA led infiltration of ISIS done completely covertly</p></li>
<li><p>Assassinations/bombings of ISIS headquaters = no more ISIS</p></li>
<li><p>nobody finds out for 10 years that our government even did anything</p></li>
</ul>

<p>But instead, look at what is happening. </p>

<p>That is a lie, stop being a liar in here.</p>

<p>Osama Bin Laden is quite obviously a real person.</p>

<p>What&#39;s being questioned is if he himself is actually in certain videos where they claim it to be Osama Bin Laden, or if they were using a double of him for scripted propaganda videos.</p>

<p>Since there is ample evidence of people looking almost identical to other people, I don&#39;t see how this theory is even remotely close to being far fetched, it&#39;s extremely possible.</p>

<p>a friend of mine who is an avid Fox watcher, made some very anti arab comments to his (5YO) grandson, this is passed on conditioning. as carefully planned and executed by the psychologists at Fox.</p>

<p>hes not stupid, far from it, but his world view is Fox shaped, as that is his TV channel of choice, all-in-one news and entertainment. (but a very very big fan of &#39;Breaking Bad&#39; which is rebellious against the system TV)</p>

Not all of them are terrorists.&quot; To this day, I have held that to heart. </p>

<p>I learned the term from kids at school. Many kids were parroting what their parents were saying. even my uncle (who was raising me) insulted them. I did too, until that moment. After, I felt uncomfortable around people who used insults. I felt like they didn&#39;t have a reason to insult all arabs/indians. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some people are really scare, many are not.</p>

<p>There is a lot of people that are anxious about it and even if they don&#39;t expect to get stuck in some random explosion somewhere, they have it in the back of their head and since the mainstream media never stop talking about it, it builds up.</p>

<p>This is how you condition people to something. You keep repeating it until they aknowledge it, or in this case, fear it a way or another.</p>

<p>Something will happen, they will think ISIS first, even if they are not scare of it... but they hear so much about it, it become the first thing they think about.</p>

<p>Soon enough, the governments come with new laws and regulations because of some threat that could happen because of ISIS and most people will just let it go because they think that&#39;s fine.. &quot;the threat is real&quot;, they hear so much about it.</p>

<p>There is a psychology factor here that most people don&#39;t even realize.</p>

<p>Of course it does not affect everyone the same way, but just look.. when they start promoting some Ebola vaccines. Even if most people around you doesn&#39;t want to get it and are not scared about this... just wait and see the waiting lines there will be for getting the vaccine.</p>

<p>Remember H1N1? Biggest joke ever. Same story. They build it up so much until the majority feel the need to be vaccinated. Most people that got sick are the one that have been vaccinated. That&#39;s it, they create needs for &quot;protection&quot; out of fear of some threat.</p>

<p>There is a LOT of people out there listening to the mainstream media almost like it is their god that bring them all the answers. Those are the majority, the masses.</p>

<p>Outrage equals emotional <em>non-rational</em> thinking. This is what TPTB want and need in order to create public consent for continued military intervention in the Middle East. This is particularly so for action against the Assad regime in Syria.</p>

<p>It was just a year ago that the US had a big hard on for going after Assad. But the public and even the Congress said &quot;no way&quot;. ISIS conveniently popped up out of nowhere during the time since then. Now the public is OK with bombing Syria.

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely pay attention to what the &quot;news&quot; is up to. Disheartening, dividing and planting seeds of fear into the viewers. The internet is great for this. </p>

<p>But investing time in anything on television beyond movies or games is history for me personally. It feels good too not thinking about any of the garbage they spew out. Now when I look in from the outside the fear propaganda is so obvious it&#39;s painful to watch. </p>

<p>Take for example the Ebola deal. They keep repeating it over and over again when there isn&#39;t anything the general population can do about it. So why worry the people over something we have no control over? They want us afraid and confused. </p>

Why they want regime change? because assad is opposing the NWO agenda by not allowing &quot;the central bank&quot; to lay foot on the syria land andn ot allowing the said pipelines to cross syria to go to usa from saudi arabia because syria gain nothing from doing so.
Why they want regime change 2.0? because syria is an ally of russia, iran, china and the new banking cartel that chinaand russia are creating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ISIS does not exist.</p>

<p>Just like someone planned an <em>entire war</em> before realizing that &quot;Operation Iraqi Liberation&quot; before realizing that those words, when used as a nifty US Mil acronym, spell out <strong>OIL</strong>.</p>

<p>Same here. ISIS=Israeli Secret Intelligence Services. Then someone realized that the translation from Hebrew would spell out the name of the people behind &quot;ISIS!&quot;</p>

<p>ISIS is bullshit. CIA. Mossad. War is money. Money is power. </p>

<p>And we are dealing with the biggest money junkies in the World here.</p>

<p>Likely &quot;ISIS&quot; is nothing but the CIA working with the Jewish SITE Group writing the scripts and running PR (and making those <em>hilariously fake</em> &quot;beheading&quot; videos).</p>

<p>Why?? They can be funded by so many other organizations/governments (and definitely are).</p>

<p>The IS is extremely media conscious, and they&#39;re playing on it to get as many new recruits as possible. They WANT to be known worldwide, it&#39;s their mission: to convert the entire world to their interpretation of islam. They have everything to win by getting themselves known.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the link between getting some media attention on yourself and being &quot;manufactured&quot;?? By your logic, all these other parts of the world you cited are not &quot;manufactured&quot; shootings SIMPLY because it&#39;s not widely covered by media. Considering the amount of weaponry and assests the IS possess, is it such a long shot to suppose they have very basic (judging from the video I linked) filming/editing gear..?</p>

<p>I can admit there&#39;s a lot of chances of a government being involved with them, but the US is the least likely one. They&#39;d have nothing to gain from it since they want to destroy that very group. It&#39;s not really how international politics work...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s how I see it.  There is definitely a  massive sectarian conflagration  going on over there in Iraq and Syria. There is definitely a Sunni militant group called ISIS/ISIL/IS. They are probably supported by the US and it&#39;s allies.  But the idea of ISIL, the decapitations, the propaganda, the memes, that&#39;s probably 90% fiction produced by foreign or domestic intelligence services. </p>

<p>The official ISIL story line shouted at you by the MSM and the blog-spheres and the comment sections is very neat. There are dozens of these memes that are crafted in a way to simultaneously be totally unquestionable while also being extremely nonsensical. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you know them. Take for instances, <em>ISIL has advanced weapons that Iraqi security forces abandoned in their cowardly retreat</em>. To believe that you have to believe that the Iraqi security forces are not only stupid but completely irrational. Here&#39;s another <em>ISIL is making millions everyday selling oil</em>, to who? <em>ISIL is already planning to sneak over the porous Mexican border</em> except the don&#39;t need to because <em>There are hundreds of ISIL fighters holding western passports</em> so they can just take US AIR unless <em>Western ISIL fighters are tearing up their passports</em> for youtube videos because <em>ISIL is recruiting fighters on social media</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still think it&#39;s unlikely that the US is behind any sort of funding for the ISIS, considering:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The ISIS&#39;s stated goal is to destroy western, infidel society, and establish a worldwide caliphate under Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi. What would be the point of funding them.</p></li>
<li><p>The US have undertaken military action against the IS, meaning they would be spending money to destroy something they are even now spending money on, for nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that funding the IS brings absolutely no tactical/military/economical advantage to the US whatsoever.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For example, a state that could plausibly support the IS (but that we won&#39;t ASSUME are because evidence is lacking) would be Turkey, as the IS is in the midst of war with kurdish populations. This is something Turkey definitely doesn&#39;t have a problem with.</p>

<p>I understand the US has a very strong worldwide presence, but it&#39;s still not appropriate to assume they are behind the Islamic State for those reasons. There is not much advantage for the US to fund such a group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose you could blame Yemen, Pakistan, [Turkey[very likely] for having involvement, but the fact is ISIS has huge access to Abrams tanks, humvees and plethora of other US equipment we supplied to Iraq. Who else could train them on how to use most of this equipment other than good ole CIA? I&#39;m not saying we deliberately created ISIS necessarily to attack us... though many will. However I definitely believe we trained these most of these guys, and armed them[Benghazi rings a bell here] through Libya in order to take down Syria.</p>

<p>Based Bashar Assad has been holding them off, so they formed a larger ideology after the group took out the leadership of FSA and other more moderate groups, and moved on weak corruptible Iraq, and somehow ran into a  500$ million bank account as well as an army that melted before them[our tax dollars at work in both ways]. Somehow ISIS also had time to create a logo and a brand name and put it on all their vehicles and property, not to mention the well funded media. I cannot possibly see how the US is the least likely one when every single aspect of ISIS origin involves originally trying toppling our &#39;enemy&#39; Assad, as well as the equipment they are using. The fact they have a direct line to our media is also bizarre as fuck for obvious reasons. </p>

I guess you&#39;ve never heard of this group called Al Qaeda... because that&#39;s EXACTLY how international politics works and has been for decades. Remember when Osama was our ally? </p>

<p>Your analogy would make sense if the US had supported al Qaeda while their goals of annihilating western society were known. However, we know that the US actually never supported the organization known as al Qaeda, formed in 1988. They only learned of its existence around the 90s anyways. bin Laden also only became visibly hostile after the Saudi Kingdom allowed (even demanded) US troops to be stationed on their soil for the war in Kuwait, against Saddam Hussein.</p>

<p>As for the Taliban, they were composed of members who went to madrassas which had been funded by the CIA and the ISI in the 80s in their struggle against the Soviet Union, yes. This is not the same as saying that the CIA funded the Taliban as an entity though... not at all.</p>

<p>Edit: the CIA also never directly trained the afghan mujahideen under strict orders from the Pakistani ISI. They supplied money and weapons to the ISI, who then distributed it how they wanted. The ISI were also the ones who were actually training the mujahideen in the madrassas. They forbade the CIA to get their hands into it directly.</p>

<p>Just like someone planned an entire war before realizing that &quot;Operation Iraqi Liberation&quot; before realizing that those words, when used as a nifty US Mil acronym, spell out OIL.</p>

<p>That was a joke on the Tonight Show, not reality.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoSBqs6y8uM">Here&#39;s video of Press Secretary Fleisher using that term</a></p>

<p><a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/03/20030324-4.html">And here&#39;s a transcript of that exact video from an official government website</a>  -- just hit ctrl+f and type in &quot;operation iraqi liberation&quot; and it pops up.</p>

<p>Now mind you that the ensuing iraq <strong>invasion</strong> was not called operation iraqi liberation, but Operation Iraqi Freedom; what a farce!</p>

<p>Besides, the notion that the war in Iraq was about oil shouldn&#39;t be controversial.  <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/16/iraq.iraqtimeline">Here&#39;s a quote from Alan Greenspan about just that: &#39;I am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows: the Iraq war is largely about oil.&#39;</a></p>

<p>That was <em>after</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/21/world/nation-war-attack-us-british-troops-push-into-iraq-missiles-strike-baghdad.html">the name Operation Iraqi Freedom had been used</a>, not before. </p>

<p>It&#39;s probably after Leno made the joke, too. Leno made the joke before March 27, but I can&#39;t find the exact date.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/MDmCnjR.png"><em>The Guardian</em>, Mar 19, 2003</a>: &quot;Anti-war MPs vowed to fight on; they are convinced that disaster awaits Mr Blair during the campaign dubbed Operation Iraqi Freedom by the US yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p>So it was called Operation Iraqi Freedom from the day before the invasion actually began.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://i.imgur.com/u088MXN.png">letter in the very next day&#39;s Guardian</a> says &quot;The US dubs this war &#39;Operation Iraqi Freedom&#39;. &#39;Operation Iraqi Liberation&#39; is more realistic—and makes a more appropriate acronym.&quot;</p>

<p>So the joke name dates to just one or two days <em>after</em> the real name.</p>

<p>Some other citations from that week:</p>

<p><a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;amp;dat=20030321&amp;amp;id=O2lPAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;sjid=NQQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;pg=4366,1613180"><em>Toledo Blade</em>, Mar 21, 2003</a>: &quot;Battle dubbed &#39;Operation Iraqi Freedom&#39;&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch/#/%22operation+iraqi%22/since1851/allresults/1/allauthors/oldest/">Here&#39;s a list of <em>New York Times</em> stories with the phrase &quot;Operation Iraqi&quot; in order from the earliest.</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!search/%22operation$20iraqi$20freedom%22$20leno$20/rec.music.artists.springsteen/8cU3In-XHWo/d2_gngAnjGAJ">list of jokes circulating on March 27, 2003</a> includes this: &quot;War continues in Iraq. They&#39;re calling it Operation Iraqi Freedom. They were going to call it Operation Iraqi Liberation until they realized that spells &#39;OIL.&#39; —Jay Leno.&quot; I think the earliest that this could have aired was the evening of Mar. 24, so this would have been after the press conference linked above.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was 9, I was in a car with my best friend and his dad. This was a few months after the towers fell. My friend and I were making fun of turbans, and his dad said &quot;They aren&#39;t called &#39;towelheads&#39;, they are turbans and you need to respect their religious beliefs. Not all of them are terrorists.&quot; To this day, I have held that to heart. </p>

<p>I learned the term from kids at school. Many kids were parroting what their parents were saying. even my uncle (who was raising me) insulted them. I did too, until that moment. After, I felt uncomfortable around people who used insults. I felt like they didn&#39;t have a reason to insult all arabs/indians. </p>

<p>If it wasn&#39;t for my friend&#39;s dad, I might be just like everyone else who hates muslims today. </p>

<p>The point of my reply is to say that I agree with you. </p>
