    <div class="md"><p>It is documented that lots of people were spied on. Just about anyone involved in Occupy or who goes to political type meetings. All of those people would be suspect, and their friends, etc. </p>

<p>I recently saw a number that it was up to over 1 million people in the US of A who were under this sort of surveillance. I know I was. Some of the signs of it were terribly obvious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But, if we look things from a different perspective...</p>

<p>Snowden said the NSA are actively trading naked pictures from their database. A week or two we later the Fapception occurred. Also sometime in that period we learn of a &quot;second&quot; whistleblower. I&#39;m of the opinion that we&#39;re seeing Snowden leaks done in a less obvious manner instead of straight from Greenwald. Or I could be completely off base on this. Either or, we live in interesting times where people are beginning to truth seek...</p>

<p>I have been documenting what it is like as a US citizen to be under their damaging surveillance since 2004. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure he and I have argued about it at one point or another, he would consider me radical and unproven. I do remember being very frustrated with him on more than one occasion about how completely clueless he seemed to be about the whole situation. </p>
