    <div class="md"><p>Seriously speaking, that&#39;s actually pretty convincing, especially the bit about how they&#39;re moving in slow motion. I got a video and watched it at 2x speed, and indeed, it looks perfectly Earthly.</p>

<p>Maybe the reason this conspiracy theory is considered the most tinfoil is that the official story is just so ludicrous?</p>

<p>Edit: We should start a huge kickstarter project to get another man on the moon. Just hire NASA to do it.</p>

I was completely blown away by the amount of convincing information that&#39;s out there that points to NASA&#39;s official story being complete bullshit.</p>

<p>If we did make it there (which I doubt), we almost certainly were using different technology than we were told.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see why the technology claimed to have gotten us there isn&#39;t good enough.  Space is empty, all you need is a big rocket and a flight plan.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an explanation: ancient ETs were big on numerology and interesting coincidences, so they scoured the universe for an &quot;auspicious&quot; planet. Yes, they&#39;re like the Chinese. Upon finding all these coincidences for Earth, they decide to terraform it and plant upon it the seeds of life. It&#39;s their lucky terrarium.</p>

<p>The amount of computing power required to get a machine to the moon would be no different than getting a man there. In fact, it would probably require more computing power to get a machine there because it would require some sort of rudimentary AI since it couldn&#39;t depend on human input.  It&#39;s the same calculations, just different values for variables like weight.</p>

<p>In your Nokia, you have a GUI, which itself requires much more than what would be required for a simple spacecraft computer, which IIRC, had analog input.  Not to mention your Nokia runs on more high-level programming, like C++ or Java, which inherently requires more memory than something like FORTRAN or Assembly, which is likely what NASA uses for spacecraft.</p>

<p>Also, memory in computing is used mostly for storing variables.  I can&#39;t imagine there being many variables to keep track of on a spacecraft.  Fuel reserves, oxygen levels, trajectory, velocity, acceleration?  64kb (IIRC that&#39;s how much the Apollo spacecraft had) when used for just numbers, is a LOT of memory to work with.</p>

<p>Also, you&#39;re forgetting that many calculations were done by people and computers on Earth and then transmitted, so lack of computing power wouldn&#39;t really be that much of an issue anyway.</p>

<p>My main point: I don&#39;t see why space travel would even require a lot of computing power in the first place.</p>

<p>Have you ever found it curious that there is no delay whatsoever when listening to the transmissions between the spacecraft and NASA?  How did they manage instantaneous wireless transfer of communications without even a second&#39;s delay?</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I said <em>diameter</em>.  I wasn&#39;t talking about mass.  The only reason eclipses exist is because of this little curious, cosmic &quot;coincidence&quot;.</p>

<p>How many variables could there possibly be?  A few hundred boolean, a few hundred numbers, and a few dozen strings?  Hardly enough to complain about lack of memory.  It&#39;s literally just for guiding the ship using a reference point and simple Newtonian physics.  Actually, the source code for the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/virtualagc/source/browse/trunk/Comanche055/CM_BODY_ATTITUDE.s?r=258">command module</a> and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/virtualagc/source/browse/trunk/Luminary099/LUNAR_LANDING_GUIDANCE_EQUATIONS.s?r=258">lander</a> are freely available.  Like I said, minimal variables.  Calculating trajectory is not difficult in a vacuum.  Most of the variables are just simple booleans (which take only 1 <em>bit</em> of memory) verifying that a circuit is closed, and thus isn&#39;t malfunctioning.</p>

<p>Unless there were a lot of string variables, which I very, very highly doubt, memory simply would not be an issue with an analog computer with 64kb of memory.  64kb - that&#39;s enough for 526,336 boolean (true or false) variables, 16,448 numerical variables with values up to 2 billion, or 65,792 single-letter string variables.</p>

<p>Your phone has to do a lot more than crunch numbers and monitor systems for failure.  A <strong>lot</strong> more.  A GUI has as many hexadecimal (1 byte or 8 bit) variables as there are pixels on your monitor, at least, just to know what color to make them.  Then it needs variables for calculating window size / location. And again, it is coded in a high level language, which inherently requires more memory than a low-level machine language.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They are likely edited for public viewing.  Also, with the amount of training they had, the astronauts could likely anticipate the questions of mission control.  In addition, try listening to the first hour or so of the Apollo 11 EVA. Very often when Neil or Buzz keys their mic you can hear the tail end of mission control&#39;s last statement echoing from the astronaut&#39;s earphones to his microphone, exactly 2.6 seconds after it was directly recorded on the tape. It went onto the tape, but also to the moon and back and onto the tape again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s why I said <em>diameter</em>.</p>

<p>Point conceded.  Its relevance still eludes me however.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any conspiracy  stating that the Twin Towers fell because of planted explosive charges is just silly.</p>

<p>The same goes for the allegation that no plane hit the Pentagon. The actual evidence clearly shows this to be retarded, yet people keep repeating it.</p>

<p>There are a lot of false conspiracy theories out there, and it&#39;s my own belief that some of them are sustained by government people who use them to divert public attention away from the real conspiracies ... such as the involvement of Israel in the 9-11 attacks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most. Especially the wild ass fantasy ones.</p>

<p>Makes it easier if you name some though. There are a whole lot of them out there. Here&#39;s a list of 10 from TIME:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The JFK Assassination (plausible)</p></li>
<li><p>9/11 Cover-Up (plausible)</p></li>
<li><p>Area 51 and the Aliens (doubtful)</p></li>
<li><p>Paul Is Dead (LOL)</p></li>
<li><p>Secret Societies Control the World (yes, but not quite the way some here fear)</p></li>
<li><p>The Moon Landings Were Faked (LOL)</p></li>
<li><p>Jesus and Mary Magdalene (That he was married? He didn&#39;t exist.)</p></li>
<li><p>Holocaust Revisionism (Holocaust happened)</p></li>
<li><p>The CIA and AIDS (doubtful)</p></li>
<li><p>The Reptilian Elite (LOL)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And 2 of my own favorites (true ones):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Michael Hastings (he was clearly assassinated)</p></li>
<li><p>Religion (biggest, most prolific, most thorough, most effective mind / behavior control mechanism that has ever existed, and those of you who downvote without comment because I just wrote that prove it)</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I know that&#39;s a touchy subject.</p>

<p>Control can come from many directions and serve a variety of purposes. The key for each of us is to stop believing anything that is told to us just because we are predisposed to believe whatever it is that is being told or because the source seems to somehow align with our preconceived notions.</p>

<p>We need to question everything, dig, and find the truth. We should especially do that for the things with which we believe almost innately.</p>

<p>&quot;My government would <em>never</em> use a false flag to start a war.&quot; That is a pretty common, instantly believed statement for the vast majority of people, right?  That&#39;s because they were conditioned to trust their government from kindergarten.</p>

<p>&quot;God told me to go free the Iraqi citizens.&quot; That&#39;s a double-edged sword. It plays on the indoctrination from birth into a specific religion and the knee-jerk belief that everything that comes from that religion&#39;s deity is good and just and right. It also plays upon the indoctrination into the capitalist, psuedo-republic facade over fascism indoctrinated from early school years.</p>

<p>The truth is manipulated equally by public schools, politicians, mega-media, organized religion, and even some of the web sites I keep seeing pop up on this sub. Every last one of them has an agenda, and that agenda is never, ever to help us, the common guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. To expand just a bit more...</p>

<p>One of the biggest points to question your own agreement on is anything that creates divisiveness - &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot;.</p>

<p>This starts with kids cartoons and church, accelerates rapidly in middle and high school, and really goes through the roof in college and onward.</p>

<p>Kids cartoons already set up the good guys vs. the bad guys. They start to paint the bad guys as inherently evil. They want to harm people just to harm them. No redeeming qualities. Of course, most of us know real life is not at all like that; it&#39;s shades of gray.</p>

<p>Religion... most organized religions... paint other religions and lack of religion as wrong and bad and even sometimes downright evil. Christians and Muslims have been killing each other pretty much non-stop since years were counted in 3 digits instead of four. Atheists are to be avoided (at best, today) or burned at the stake. The latter would still be applicable to witches if the law would only allow it. Complete divisiveness there -  you&#39;re with us or you&#39;re against us and those are the only two options. Oh, plus there&#39;s an afterlife so dying for your own group while killing the other group is just ducky. Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll be rewarded with angel wings or a shitload of virgins depending on which region you were born in.</p>

<p>Middle and high school really emphasizes cliques and sports. So you have the jocks, nerds, burn-outs, brains, and whatever else these days and mostly it&#39;s non-violent but there are clear &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; delineations. In sports, we start getting taught that we should want OUR team to CRUSH their team. Their team is the bad guys. Maybe we tell ourselves they play dirty or smell bad or whatever. Point is, it&#39;s not a friendly, sportsmanlike competition any more. It&#39;s us vs. them.</p>

<p>In college, this gets really huge. Go to the Ohio State vs. U of Michigan game wearing the other school&#39;s colors and see what happens. If you&#39;re lucky, the worst you&#39;ll get is a constant beer shower. If you&#39;re lucky.</p>

<p>There are other groupings too. And they&#39;re all artificial. Skin color. Gender. Sexual orientation. Type of job you work. Financial resources at your disposal. Education level. Anything and everything that makes you unique also makes you divided. The people in control absolutely leverage the &quot;us&quot; vs. &quot;them&quot; mentality these divisions create to control you. All of you. Even me when I don&#39;t recognize it. Every. Single. Day.</p>

<p>The only way to break that control mechanism is to tell it to fuck off. To appreciate the differences among us because those differences are what make us interesting. I mean, could you imagine the hell you&#39;d live in if every single person on the planet was exactly you? Not that you&#39;re a bad person or anything, but really... every person is exactly the same? FUCK THAT!</p>

<p>&quot;They&quot; will never tell you that because it is the key to beating them. Once we tell them to shove their artificial groupings and the tension they create up their asses, and that we&#39;re going to give a damn about each other no matter what they try to tell us, they&#39;ll have nothing left with which to control us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok holocaust did happen I agree. But the lingering question is to what extent. See this is how the media does with 9/11 the say planes hit the towers and killed people you bastard. Then dismiss you. </p>

<p>Not anyone can deny aircraft hit the towers. What we all question is the validity that the reason the towers fell is the planes hitting them. </p>

<p>I hope that makes since.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing: The towers did not have to fall for TPTB to have gotten every last thing they wanted out of the attack. I challenge anyone to produce a plausible &quot;extra&quot; that happened because the towers fell, that would not have happened without the towers falling.</p>

<p>If it was a conspiracy, the conspiracy was to plant the seed with al Qaeda to do the attack, then look the other way / have &quot;intelligence failures&quot; until it happened. Subtlety and simplicity often work better than grandiose sledgehammer schemes, especially where the government / intelligence are concerned.</p>
