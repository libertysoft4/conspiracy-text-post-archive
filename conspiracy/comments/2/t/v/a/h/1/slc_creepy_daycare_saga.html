    <div class="md"><p>So I just came back from the place and found something in the back covered by a camo tarp. I then saw a mexican man come out, pick something up and go back inside. Earlier in the day I went there and saw a pizza guy trying to deliver a pizza to the place. (They were probably being trolled) He knocked and knocked and nobody came to the door. He left, and I was about to as well until I noticed kids walking up to the door and trying to get in, finally an old mexican lady opened the front door and let them in.</p>

<p>5 years of living here, never saw a single person go in or out. Then in one day i see 4 people. Weird.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
Turns out it was a picnic table under the tarp.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I went to daycare K-3rd grade after school. I got out at 3:00 PM, but my mom wasn&#39;t off work and back in our town until around 4:30ish.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just odd the two little girls were seen without a chaperone of some sort.. Generally there is a check-in and/or check-out for kids at pre schools and daycares.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Afternoon isn&#39;t strange. There are a lot of laws that surround how long a child can stay at an establishment. If you have a daycare and children stay there all day you make yourself subject to state inspection. But if the kids stay half the day you can dodge it (depending on what state). </p>

<p>If there is a certain time that the place accepts children being &quot;dropped off&quot; then that would explain why the kids show up at the same time. I know of a daycare that has a window to drop your kids off and then essentially locks the door so nobody can come in while they watch your kids. </p>

<p>The most alarming and telling piece of evidence would be a lack of adult supervision. If the children are unaccompanied by an adult I would find that very suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could the kids have come from school? </p>

<p>If any of the schools there have those &quot;staggered&quot; schedules like they do in some communities, there could be kids that start very early, like 7 AM, but they get out at 1 or 2. If their parents work till 5 or 6, it&#39;s not unusual for the younger ones to go to a day care or after-school program of some kind.</p>

<p>If there are other kids there inside, one would hope the lady wouldn&#39;t just leave the door to the place unlocked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess, based on the alleged Air Force linguist, is that it may be a front for a military program. Perhaps layered; for example, a linguistics research facility fronting as a drug house, fronting as a daycare. </p>

<p>Mind you, this is all wild speculation.</p>

<p>It may even be a government safehouse or listening post for operatives in the SLC area. From what I understand there is a significant community of Persian Americans (Iranians) in SLC, and given the claimed languages spoken (generally central asian) by DeathShip (assuming his accounts are factual), it wouldn&#39;t be unreasonable to infer that his work with the Air Force was related to monitoring communications in central Asia.</p>

<p>That said, if this is in fact the case, the general public will remain in the dark about it, given the nature of operations that could be presumed to be related to the facility.</p>

<p>Just my two cents.</p>

The person letting them in......an elderly hispanic lady.  And that thing that everyone was freaking out about being hid under the &quot;camo&quot; tarp ended up being a picnic table.  So...has anyone actually seen anything illegal happening at this place?  Anyone???  Please leave these people alone.  You are making a big deal out of NOTHING!!!

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I think I figured it out.</p>

<p>So based on this info from above:</p>

<p><em>The Break-in</em></p>

<p><em>(user requested his name be removed) says, &quot;I just talked to my friend who lived right be there for about a year and said one night they jimmied their way in out of curiosity and in the main room was mostly just a chair facing a TV displaying a live video of the other room in the building.&quot;</em> He also adds, <strong>&quot;The laundromat across the street constantly has cops there for drug busts.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The daycare is most likely a cop stakeout for surveillance on the laundromat.</p>

<p>If this was some Mexican cartel place, I doubt they would have people on reddit making sure no one talks about it.   </p>

<p>This is what seems to fit everything going on there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally really, really doubt that the most fitting explanation is that the cops set up a fake business, and have been paying rent on a building disguised as a day care for many years, solely to watch 1 laundromat.</p>

<p>Do all of their TVs at the station have to be broken for this theory to work?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Depends on the number of busts in the laundromat.  If they average 2 or 3 busts a week, then paying rent would absolutely be a cash cow for that police department and worth it.  But if they only make 1 bust a month there, then it wouldn&#39;t be worth the rent.</p>

<p>Btw, your response is oddly upvoted alot for my hypothesis being so &quot;obviously not correct&quot;.  Weird......</p>

<p>I&#39;ve worked in child-care centres before and (to add to your helpful points <a href="/u/hangipants">/u/hangipants</a>) I think a small, yet main aspect of this is the lack of children&#39;s name tags on the bag hanging area, both inside, and what seems to be another bag/locker area for children (Near the back door, blue shelving).  </p>

<p>I have never seen a facility for small children not take up this simple, and cheap practice. There is no reason they would not have this, if the centre was providing care for children.</p>

<p>Note also the flag in the larger window to the left of the door - it seems to have fallen down in the time from &#39;11 to &#39;14. Kinda hard to believe that in a time span of ~three years nobody would go out of their way to pick up or reattach an item come loose.</p>

<p>But judging from the other windows, where (presumed) child drawings <em>have</em> been hanging for three years, it might not be too much of a stretch to assume the flag has been down for a while.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a bad front to launder money though.  The way to.launder money is to have a business that is cash and doesn&#39;t have customers that can be easily identified.  That way the owners can massively inflate the number of customers and what they purchased so that they can claim high earnings when in reality there was little to none.  A daycare is no good because they are highly regulated, have limited numbers of customers, has easily identifiable customers, and is most likely not a cash business.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you start a company (whether it&#39;s a corporation, LLC, DBA), you are required to pick a state to incorporate in. You must file the proper documents for that state and these documents are typically public record. Most states allow these documents to be searched on their government websites. Some of them (like Utah) allows you to do a principal search, meaning you can look up all companies who have have founders/officers with the names you are interested in (for example &quot;Eva Solano&quot;) for that state.</p>

<p>The &quot;registered agent&quot; is the person who is the point of contact for the corporation (typically for legal reasons). Most people make themselves the registered agent (instead of paying an outside company), so this is one way to get data. If someone wanted to sue the company or take other action, they would need someone to serve these documents to, as corporations themselves are not physical entities.</p>

<p>As for the tech side, when you register a domain (.com, .net, etc) you will fill out personal information as to who it is registered to. This is not &quot;required&quot; and often times domain services will default to the information you used to sign up for the domain to begin with. This information is publicly available via WHOIS lookup.</p>

<p>There are other websites that offer business data lookup, which is public record. They are just aggregators of this data and make it easier to search (typically crawling and caching it themselves, similar to Google).</p>

<p>I can give a reasonable explanation to the 29:32 issue. They may be licensed for 29 children a day, but have some part time (3 or 4 days a week) spots. Therefore, you could end up with more spots than your total capacity number. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the same guy. The FB profile in question seems to be of a construction worker in the Dominican Republic with a pretty banal life. It says he went to HS in salt lake city, thus that explains his &quot;lives in&quot;. Its probably &#39;cool&#39; for him to put he lives in America on his profile.</p>

<p>I found her and Richard&#39;s Facebook pretty easily as well.</p>

<p>This is the <a href="https://secure.utah.gov/bes/action/details?entity=673090-0142">Topham&#39;s Tiny Tots</a> profile on Utah&#39;s government site. Seems to be registered to &quot;E. Gregg Tobler&quot; back in 1977, continuously renewed and in good standing.</p>

<p>Honestly, I don&#39;t believe the Yocoms to be involved in any of this. Seems like they started their own business in 1973, eventually selling it to the Solanos in 2003. That&#39;s probably where it went downhill and became what it is now. Likely they got it on the cheap and could piggyback of the community reputation of &quot;a good daycare&quot; to keep up appearances.</p>

<p>Tobler (or associates) might be old friends with the Yocoms and offered her a job for what she has many years experience in. Considering this company has been continuously registered for nearly 40 years, it does not come across as suspicious.</p>

If he always comes at, say roughly 2PM, what&#39;s the point of saying that it&#39;s always nap time.? Maybe he comes there in a span of a few hours or changed his route slightly so he went there at a different time. Or maybe he&#39;s not actually a mailman. I wanna believe though</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, if it&#39;s the same mail carrier. If there&#39;s someone replacing her then it may vary (this goes for both my mom&#39;s house and my dad&#39;s house which are located in way different parts of the city of Philadelphia). But obviously the POV was from 1 single mail carrier and I&#39;ve read in the few different places this comment was brought up that their mail gets delivered around the same time as well. </p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s been noted that other people have said their child&#39;s daycare has either staggered or multiple nap times per day. </p>

<p>What sticks out to me more than multiple naps is that some people are saying they&#39;ve never seen any kids in or around it and then someone happened to snap pics of 2 yesterday, and the place is still getting violations as if it&#39;s fully functioning. That&#39;s what doesn&#39;t add up to me. The mail carrier&#39;s observation isn&#39;t close to disturbing compared to these shipping details and business owners.</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>If you must continue your search. Try to uncover what you seek do not say I didn&#39;t warn you. Things like this are always ran by dangerous people.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Also, I uncovered this-</p>

<p>I googled the phone number to the daycare and It showed the name to Fun Time Kidcare. Same name as the other weird place, just not the exact same with spelling. Only difference is, it&#39;s a new address.
Come to find out that it&#39;s been operating since &#39;07. One year after the creepy daycare went out of business. Now it gets weird when you find out both business share the same number. The same number that hardly anybody picks up and when they do it a guy with broken english telling me that its for low income families only and that I need to go through the Dept. Of Workforce services.
Why do they share the same number? Why does the guy tell me something completely different?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True...but in the OP&#39;s case they didn&#39;t start out by browsing <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> . And, when it comes time to talk about that, I would think this particular OP has the ability to explain that in a way that, if all this communication is by email, therefore able to be reposted publicly, will make their use of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> seem reasonable, if not the most rational recourse. Especially given the recent fact that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> seems to be the last recourse of things, laughably, deleted from <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a>.</p>

<p>Point being that reddit as a whole seems to be taking <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> more seriously lately.</p>

<p>So yes, you&#39;re right, I wouldn&#39;t start my conversation with the police out with &quot;So, like, I was on r/conspiracy, and then this happened...&quot; but I don&#39;t think the OP will do that. They seem to more intelligent than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with you that it is a bit rash to dismiss your claims on being in the Air Force and speaking 8 languages and all that based solely on your interests, your comments implying that you know what&#39;s going on in that daycare and that it&#39;s dangerous are relatively unbelievable.  You&#39;ve provided no evidence that you know what&#39;s going on, and as such your claim holds no more weight than any claim I make, such as &quot;Aliens abducted me, when I was on their ship I saw Snoo.  Snoo was the leader.  Reddit was made by aliens.&quot;.</p>

<p>If you really know what&#39;s going on in there, I&#39;d encourage you to tell us, even anonymously.  Hop on to a VPN, make a throwaway, and give us some details backed by data and/or some pictures at least.</p>

I posted a comment further down that, if this is a drug front, it would make sense that the kids that have been seen here are just the children of friends and family that distribute the drugs, hence why they don&#39;t care about training, sanitation, etc.  They&#39;re all friends &amp; work together and this place just keeps an eye on their kids while they&#39;re out doing it.

<p>Day care fraud is very much a thing, as are shell companies and fronts for illicit activities. The fact that it is run by someone employed by the city is also interesting.</p>

<p>Even if it is a sad, creepy, legit daycare... I don&#39;t believe they are running it to code standards. What kind of care are these children <em>actually</em> getting?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you scroll through the comments I&#39;ve explained and given examples of how daycare/fake child scams operate. Honestly running a legit daycare across the street from where drug busts routinely take place is a pretty poor business decision.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I saw a couple of them. The fact that if it was for money laundering and there is a laundrymat across the street is just amusing.

<p>That would be my first inclination. If he had actually worked at the Groom Lake test facility (a.k.a. Area 51) he would have signed a non-disclosure agreement. Anyone who signs such an agreement would not so readily violate it out of risk of losing their job and facing severe legal repercussions. He claims to speak eight languages, yet at no time did he provide proof to support this claim, nor did he make any supporting comments to suggest he is remotely credible. Considering the prevalence of trolls on reddit, on the Internet in general, that would appear to be the most likely explanation. It&#39;s still technically possible he could be part of some nefarious coverup, it just isn&#39;t nearly as probable of a scenario.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After reading through his history, he says he graduated high school in 2009. He says he learned all of those languages at the Defense Language Institute. At most, he is 24 years old. It was 11 months ago when he talked of working at Area 51 and also that he was no longer in the military at that time. So that means he couldn&#39;t have done more than one 4 year term in the military. I find it highly unlikely that a recruit fresh out of high school would gain enough clearance to have worked at Area 51 in just 4 years. Just my two cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Become a linguist, instant TS clearance. Pass the DLAB over a 150 your going to take a trip to some places (that&#39;s all I am going to say.) My brain is wired for languages. Can I read all of them? no, Can I speak them, yes. I have an audio graphic memory It is very easy for me to remember words and things that are verbally said with 94% recall. I am white.I am not Hindi or Pakistani I grew up in Vermont. Moved to utah in my late high school years. Graduated early with pakets. joined the Airforce at 17years old. I was not stationed at A51 I was only there for like a week. (Can not say anymore than that) Am I involved in this day care stuff? No, Hell no. Its just In my experience From what I was doing after the USAF. These places are bad news. Its easy to identify when something is up. no one walking in or out of the doors, lack of change for decades, etc. and since the thread I have done my own research. as for the people calling me a phoney because I am 24 and I bothered to actually seize the opportunities that were in front of me learned those languages went to A51 and jumped out of airplanes for a living for 4 years doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t possible. I have seen some seriously fucked up shit, It wasn&#39;t a cake walk. DLI,Jump school, S.E.R.E school, and Goodfellow AFB. did someone fuck up my DD214? I think so but I have to go to DC with a Lawyer to have a chance at that to get changed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Urdu uses cognates from other languages like Farsi and Arabic most people who speak Hindi may understand Urdu but are unable to read it or understand a few words. For instance the word for family in Urdu is خاندان &quot;Khandan&quot; But in Hindi it is परिवार &quot;Parivāra&quot; most can understand each other. Also Urdu is kind of a bitch because it is not that standardized. in Punjab they may use more Hindi based Urdu where as in Baluchistan your going to get a lot of Farsi in there. they are not the same language but they are very close to each other. Urdu is a hindi based language due to its grammatical structure simple words are going to be the same but the more specified the words like medical terminology is going to be Farsi. religious colloquialisms are going to be arabic. </p>

<p>Surely, if he is from India/Pakistan then Hindi-Urdu and English are almost given. But Punjabi, Bengali and Balochi are very different languages to learn.</p>

<p>In any case: I know Hindi/Urdu and can understand Punjabi as well. I&#39;d challenge DeathShip to prove that he speaks these languages. </p>

Just as I expected!</p>

<p>So I just went to Google Translate, and typed:</p>

<p>&quot;I will not play your games&quot;
and translated it into Hindi and Urdu. </p>

<p>Naturally it gave what you wrote me: </p>

<p>Hindi: 
<a href="https://translate.google.com/#en/hi/I%20will%20not%20play%20your%20games">https://translate.google.com/#en/hi/I%20will%20not%20play%20your%20games</a></p>

<p>Urdu: 
<a href="https://translate.google.com/#en/ur/I%20will%20not%20play%20your%20games">https://translate.google.com/#en/ur/I%20will%20not%20play%20your%20games</a></p>

<p>Except that there is one problem, buddy. It&#39;s wrong :) 
(As usual, Google translate is not 100% perfect)</p>

<p>You wrote: Meh apni khale nehe khalunga.
Should be: Main aapke khel nahi khelunga. </p>

<p>For Urdu, you wrote: Main aapke khel nahin khelenge. </p>

<p>which is once again wrong: (should be same as Hindi translation)</p>

<p>Please stop being phony :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not so certain.</p>

<p>It may be an attempt to troll the UFO angle, but I have an alternate hypothesis.</p>

<p>The Air Force is responsible for communications intelligence. </p>

<p>The Air Force maintains many bases in Germany.</p>

<p>The US Gov&#39;t has reasons to monitor central Asia.</p>

<p>These facts lend plausibility to the idea that there would be an individual in the Air Force with knowledge of the languages listed.</p>

<p>Furthermore, The claim that DeathShip worked at &quot;Area 51&quot; is pretty broad. He may have been assigned there for linguistic intel work unrelated to the other classified programs operating there, or maybe his work WAS there, and he had discipline issues with confidentiality; hence his &quot;questionable discharge&quot; rather than honorable discharge.</p>

<p>Regardless, my hypothesis is that the building is some sort of government facility, maybe a listening post, maybe a safehouse, who knows. But I think it&#39;s a plausible angle to consider, given the uncanny nature of the property, and the apparent secrecy surrounding it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jen has 5 kids. She tells the state she has a minimum wage job, so she needs them to give her money for child care. </p>

<p>They say, alright, well, lets see the proof you have this job.</p>

<p>Her friend Tony has a business, he cuts her checks each week as if she works there, but she doesn&#39;t. Maybe she gives it back to him, who knows. But she shows the checks to the state who eventually says, alright, this is legit, you make so little that you qualify for 200$ per kid per week to pay for child care, let us know who to give it to.</p>

<p>The last person in the scam is Linda. She runs &quot;Day Care 666&quot;, which is not real. Jen tells the state that she sends her kids to Day Care 666, and the state cuts Linda 200$ a week per kid that goes there.</p>

<p>Only Linda&#39;s not really watching the kids, so she&#39;s just netting 1000$ a week for nothing (maybe they&#39;re just with their mom or something). </p>

<p>You can see how with a few different people in on it, this could become VERY lucrative. My little example with only 20 kids would be netting 4000$ a week, that&#39;s $208,000 a year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who had lived in SLC for a lot of my childhood, I can say that the place is riddled with pedophiles. High ranking Mormons are notorious for sex scandals. I remember an ex-Mormon bishop who lived across the street from me. My Dad found out that he had been taking a &quot;bath&quot; with my dog. He would also lay naked on his front porch and watch us play, in the excuse that he was tanning. Fuck that guy, seriously. I also needed to go into &quot;stranger danger&quot; mode more than once in my time living there. It is a fucked up place, and the creepy,  dreary mood is what made us move. I can tell you that I wouldn&#39;t doubt for a second some shit is going down in this daycare. Hell, even a normal daycare in SLC is usually borderline creepy. Look into this more please. I can say with almost 100% certainty that this is definitely not what it seems from the outside. Fuck SLC. Fuck it as a whole.</p>

<p>The only thing I question/disagree with is the seeming implication in the timeline that L. Ron Hubbard was working <em>against</em> US intelligence interests whereas I&#39;ve always thought that he was working for them.  Tough to know for sure I guess way but his working as an intelligence agent for the Navy during the 40&#39;s is well-documented and I think it&#39;s likely that he was working for them all along.</p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what I think it is. There have got to be better places to make meth at, you wouldn&#39;t open a fake daycare. Daycare centers, and especially ones that have lots of orphans, are how they make kids disappear :(((</p>

After speaking with the mods here, it seemed it was either the admins or a spam filter. After my last discussion with a mod who&#39;s been following this it seems to be more likely it was an admin removal. It&#39;s still up as far as I know, but pending finding out if it was an admin removal.</p>

<p>Witch hunts are a real thing. Remember the Boston Bomber &quot;reddit detective work&quot; that basically circled a bunch of foreign looking people on photographs and publicly labeled them &quot;terrorist&quot;?</p>

<p>I find this daycare story fascinatingly creepy but you have to keep in mind that it&#39;s still possible that this is just a poor, run-down place that&#39;s maybe depressing but not otherwise special. In which case the damage done by a proper witch hunt could be greater than any kind of &quot;reveal&quot;. As a mod/admin this is one of the #1 things to look out for because it&#39;s not just affecting the user&#39;s time on the site, it can actually swap in the real world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This, above all else, is what bothers me the most, and lends credibility to the human trafficking/pedo ring theory.  </p>

<p>Even the scrapbook math (assuming I&#39;m reading everything properly (QUANTITY- 763), taking into account 400-450g per ball) you should only be looking at about ~340ish KG.  This is over 6,800 KG of stuff shipped in.  Add to that, the BL lists &#39;MEASUREMENT 0 X&#39;.  So we have sports balls that take up no space at all, that weigh 20x more than they should? Seriously, what the actual fuck did they receive in those shipping containers?  </p>

<p>But, as I said earlier in another post, if this really is a trafficking front, they&#39;ve already shut it down and are moving on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, I have a little bit of experience in this field. At market shows, or trade shows, it is very common for someone to set up a booth/table and claim to be a company that makes XYZ product. They will even have pictures or samples of high quality XYZ on display. You think they are legit and place an order with them. They then quote the order out to every mother fucker in China who makes XYZ product and send you whatever bullshit the lowest bidder makes. Depending on the product it might not make a difference. But more often than not what you get from these people is not the same quality as what you saw at their booth. I have actually gone to one of these company&#39;s &quot;factories&quot;. It was an office in a sky rise office building. The most advanced piece of machinery in there was a fax machine. Even there, face to face, they continued their lie. The factory they said was theirs that they would take us to was my buddy&#39;s factory. Be very careful who you deal with at these trade shows. I&#39;ve been to Guangdong (referenced in your screen shot) and that kind of bullshit is made there, for sure. Factories everywhere. Also, things I buy from Guangdong I actually buy through a &quot;purchasing agent&quot; I employ in Taiwan.</p>

<p>[EDIT] posted this on another guy&#39;s comment but I think it is very suspect that this container left China and landed at a port in Virginia and not in California. Logistically this is very weird to me. Methinks the VA port is more lax than the CA port. Those CA ports are no joke!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly speaking, I think this would be detail that would be consistent for a legit day care. I say that because i&#39;d almost expect that a day care provides cheap chinese toys for kids to play with that can be disposable, or broken at little to no cost for the day care.</p>

<p>All of this is very fishy, but I think this is a minor detail that may not pertain to the big picture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider this. Most daycares are run by small groups and certified baby-sitters. I have a few day-care centers in my neighborhood, run out of regular people&#39;s houses. These people don&#39;t raise the kids, they take CARE of them. yeah, toys are provided, but not in the TONS. Like really? Having over 6800kg of toys shipped to that shack of a place doesn&#39;t seem too legit... These care givers rarely make that much money, and if they do, it goes back into the business. </p>

My hunch is that these places have been observed during odd times. Maybe the mail carrier was actually there during nap time and maybe the pizza man shouldn&#39;t be delivering pizzas when they weren&#39;t ordered by the day care. The Latino man outside the place could also be explained by other normal things. I guess we will find out. If someone beats me to a stake out, please inform me so I don&#39;t waste my own time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wrote a paper on this in college. The mcmartin case was proven to be the work of a shitty child therapist and a schizophrenic mother.  </p>

<p>She dropped the kid off at the center without registering. Just dropped him on front of the door and drove off.  The people working there just took him in and waited for her to come back, which she did.  </p>

<p>She continued to bring him there.  She called the police stating that her child had been sexually assaulted. The police began an investigation. The state case, overseen by Janet Reno, involved a child psychologist who cajoled, scared, and manipulated the children at the center into describing scenarios, and asking which children were involved. The kids often started out saying that nothing unusual had happened.  She then continued to ask the kids questions as though they were lying.  The kids eventually broke down and started providing information that was demonstrably false.  She told them that their memories could be wrong, and then suggested to them what might have happened.</p>

<p>Thw original mother kept coming up with outlandish stories about tunnels under the center.  So the psychologist began by asking the children what happened in the tunnels.  The kids didn&#39;t remember any tunnels until she told them things like that they their friends had seen them in the tunnels doing sexual things with other children.  One child reported having been raped by a lion and seeing flying elephants. </p>

<p>They actually dug out under the child care Center.  Found some buried random construction tools from the construction of the center and an an old piece of clothing. The owners of the childcare center were prosecuted using the information from the children&#39;s interviews. The women were later,after several years, released. A male caretaker, the son of the owner, spent many years in prison, and may still be there. He was when I wrote the paper. . It&#39;s considered, in psychology, as an example of how easy it is to implant false memories with improper questioning techniques. </p>

<p>The mother was schizophrenic, and a bad alcoholic. Her father told police this, but they did not listen. She died, if I remember correctly, of either suicide or something to do with alcohol. She was very ill. </p>

<p>This is mostly from memory about 10 years old , so I may have some of the details mixed up. I think I still have the sourced paper around here somewhere. I believe most of the info is also in the Wikipedia article and it&#39;s linked sources.</p>

The description of Oakton on the Miller Coop webpage does not seem correct. There is not really a downtown area of Oakton other than some stores at an intersection and a shopping center. There is no historic district in Oakton. The only musuem is a 1 room historic schoolhouse. Oakton is a very small town in Fairfax county and does not have the facilities that the webpage claims. Also, I cannot seem to find a physical address for the day care. It may be another fake day care business.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s an idea for anyone here that is interested, hope people see it. I&#39;m not going to do this, because I don&#39;t live there and don&#39;t know all the facts.</p>

<p>People here are often saying this is a front for money laundering. If you have some proof of this, you can report it to the IRS and have them do an investigation. Here&#39;s a link to the program:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Whistleblower-Informant-Award">http://www.irs.gov/uac/Whistleblower-Informant-Award</a></p>

<p>If they come and find out there is unpaid tax from this business, the person that reports it can get a cut of up to 30% of it. A few scattered redditors might only have limited resources, but there is absolutely no hiding from the IRS. They can monitor phone calls and mail without a warrant, if they have reasonable suspicion of tax fraud. They&#39;re the ones that brought down Al Capone. There may be some bad people in that building, but there&#39;s no way they&#39;re more powerful than the feds whose job is to collect money.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr - For people who think this is a front for money laundering, and have proof of it, report it to the IRS. They have a whistleblowing program in place for stuff like this, and if they are successful, they&#39;ll pay you a reward of up to 30% of what they get. These guys can&#39;t outrun the IRS.</strong></p>

<p>&quot;This gets deep. URL is owned by a city employee. Why does the cities multimedia manager own the URL?
The county assessor&#39;s office says it&#39;s owned by Chunga International LLC. They have failed to renew their business license since 08/26/2014. The registering agent has the same last name as the SLC employee.
Fun Time Kidz Kare hasn&#39;t been registered since 05/24/2006. What&#39;s with the fresh paint?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Putting the tl;dr first, cause it reads so awesome</p>

<p>5 companies are on a bill of lading for 1 shipping container, contents listed as 1.1KG of &quot;plastic jewelry&quot;, and 6,852KG of &quot;soccer/footballs&quot; from China.  1 company in California makes electronic and other &quot;educational toys&quot; and seems to be on the up-and-up.  1 bait-shop in Idaho with a registered sex-offender living at the same address as a company listed as receiver of goods from the shipment.  <del>1</del> Some financial agency shell-game in Chicago. 1 shady day care in Salt Lake City whose owner shares the last name with an executive (see management, not mayoral) level employee working in City Hall.  1 bounce house rental company in Oregon no one has looked into yet. </p>

<p>The actual shipping of this container was facilitated by a company with an employed sales executive who once bought/sold &#39;merchandise&#39; in the defense sector.    </p>

<p>/facts</p>

<p>An executive who possibly networked transactions to and for, what I could only imagine being, a very intriguing international clientele in said defense industry.  However, there is nothing that explicitly connects this individual to the shipping of the container, other than he is employed for the company on the BL.</p>

<p>None of that is made up.  The links are all right in this thread.  Except the stuff I&#39;ve mentioned in my edits below, which I&#39;ll gladly share and encourage you to contact me to receive via PM. I just don&#39;t want this shut down for bs &#39;doxxing&#39;</p>

<p>Now, onto the post.....</p>

<p>Ok, not only was it the exact weights, it&#39;s the exact same product descriptions and shipping dates.</p>

<p>And &#39;Funcrest Bait Shop&#39; sounds shady as hell.  Although, all the names here involved are curious; Funland Jumpers, Fun With Phonics, Funcrest Bait Shop, and Fundamental Financial Group.  Someone really likes to have fun, and they all like getting the exact same stuff shipped to them on the same boat on the same day.  A literal boatload of fun!!</p>

<p>EDIT: all of them, all 5 business, had all their stuff shipped in the same container.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: Didn&#39;t realise I had made a new post, didn&#39;t mean to do that.  But I wanted to add:</p>

<p>The address for Fun Time Bait shop, is the same address for a registered sex offender.  Not the owner of the business mind you, but we now have a legit tie-in to pedo and these chinese shipments.  So, that&#39;s, something?</p>

<p>The Fundamental Financial Group shipment: There is no website of record for this business, however a search for the name on the BL brings up a gentleman in the chicagoland area, currently working at two places; Fundamental and North South Capital, LLC.  The address on the BL is actually the address for North South even though the company listed is Fundamental, Fundamental is registered at a totally different location about 40-50 min away.  Smells like some shell-corp antics afoot all over this thing.</p>

<p>EDIT 3: So it seems one of the executives, based on his linked-in profile, at Fun Stuff Inc (facilitator of the chinese shipment) used to work for a short time with another company</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regional Account Manager servicing the Defense Industry with Tactical Equipment, Operational Gear, MRO, Fire and Emergency Services, Expeditionary, Medical, and simplified logistic solutions.</p>

<p>ADS has developed procedures that shorten the &quot;logistics pipeline&quot; to provide rapid response and the best possible pricing to our customers worldwide.</p>

<p>ADS specializes in working with defense and security contractors as well as protective services organizations. No matter what uniform you wear, our mission is to provide the specialized equipment and related services you need to complete your mission at home, in theater, or around the globe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope, nothing curious about <em>that</em>.  Oh, and the company he works for now is the one who has their current merchandise pehind password protection.  Look at their site again, and ask why that is necessary.</p>

<p>EDIT 4: Can&#39;t seem to find much about the Fun With Phonics company, other than a lawsuit with Leapfrog.  What I do find curious though, is this is a company with almost 1 mil in annual revenue.  What are they doing in bed with these other 4 companies and shell corps?</p>

<p>Oh, the owner has spent some time in Africa you say?  Educating the children of Ethiopia?  Good for him!</p>

(not owner? but hes thee owner)  However theres several listings for Sam shaw at other companies on that page, maybe different ones but in oregon same name same age.</p>

<p>Sam Shaw is the owner.  The business address seems to be an empty lot in the woods. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/10173+Keene+Ln+SE,+Aumsville,+OR+97325/@44.8699033,-122.853329,218m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m7!1m4!3m3!1s0x54bff74ed17e5bcb:0x13d77ac590778bd5!2s10173+Keene+Ln+SE,+Aumsville,+OR+97325!3b1!3m1!1s0x54bff74ed17e5bcb:0x13d77ac590778bd5">https://www.google.com/maps/place/10173+Keene+Ln+SE,+Aumsville,+OR+97325/@44.8699033,-122.853329,218m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m7!1m4!3m3!1s0x54bff74ed17e5bcb:0x13d77ac590778bd5!2s10173+Keene+Ln+SE,+Aumsville,+OR+97325!3b1!3m1!1s0x54bff74ed17e5bcb:0x13d77ac590778bd5</a></p>

<p>Possible it might be off a little but images were taken recently far as i can tell (2015) and theres nothing there. It is registered as a 4 bedroom house built in 1991. I cant see one and theres nothing around that looks like a bouncy castle business. Its possible this is the mailing address and the business is somewhere else i suppose but even so theres no house there according to google. Their website does say they have ponies so perhaps they are there but i dont see anything.  And the names on the properties dont match.</p>

<p>Looking at the tax records i got this</p>

<p><a href="http://apps.co.marion.or.us/PropertyRecords/PropertySummary.aspx?pid=R28290">http://apps.co.marion.or.us/PropertyRecords/PropertySummary.aspx?pid=R28290</a></p>

<p>its registered to Keenan Benjamin INC. (this is getting strange)
33 acres of property. No business there. Its registereed as farmland. </p>

<p>I looked up the adreess listed on the tax site and it doesnt exist. There is a street in Salem with a similar address but is not exactly right.</p>

<p>THIS IS INTERESTING! <a href="http://yellow-pages.me/OR/funland-inc-128306.html">http://yellow-pages.me/OR/funland-inc-128306.html</a></p>

<p>Upon further search i found that Funland Inc founded by this &quot; Sam Shaw&quot; was at this address and it is listed as GUESS WHAT.... </p>

<p>A child daycare service.  </p>

<p>not a bouncy castle place. this is getting really fucked up now.
<a href="http://or.mingluji.com/business_directory/Funland_Inc">http://or.mingluji.com/business_directory/Funland_Inc</a></p>

<p>The place is suppose to be closed and according to a couple searches is actually a single family home being rented to a man. ( wont post his name) hes been there for 4 years.  There is a woman listed at the same adress with a different last name. Possible girlfriend i guess.</p>

<p>Know what else is interesting... this is close proximity to an elementary school. </p>

<p>So if what i gather may be right this is a small house that was listed as a daycare years back and run out of a home, (if its not just a shell corp which is likely) or the person living there before used this address for whatever reason. </p>

<p>However all the properties this &quot;Sam Shaw&quot; is associated with as owning DO NOT EXIST.  They are listed under other peoples names and addresses but listed as businesses with those address. He has several.</p>

<p>This guy is definatly hiding something weird. All of the businesses that name is associated with is tied to children.</p>

<p>There is a sex offender listed as the same name from another state that they apparently dont know where he is. (not saying its the same guy just coincidence)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ibegin.com/directory/us/oregon/aumsville/shaws-interiors-10173-keene-ln-se/">http://www.ibegin.com/directory/us/oregon/aumsville/shaws-interiors-10173-keene-ln-se/</a>  now hes an interior rug store.. and party store.</p>

<p>TLDR 
Same guy now apparently has a Carpet store.. that is also a party supply store.. that is also interior design.. that is also a kids party place.. that is also a bouncy castle place thats also a farm at the same address, </p>

<p>that&#39;s not in his name (shell company that doesnt exist) whose address is actually a mobile home in a different town, whose associated to a child day care, whose also tied to a shipping company, thats tied to the other weird companies thats tied to sex offenders and possible trafficking.</p>

Everyone here is saying it&#39;s some sort of human trafficking, but I&#39;m inclined to say that China puts all sorts of labels on things to get around various tariffs and taxes and customs technicalities.</p>

<p>2 theories:</p>

<p>A) Maybe there was nothing actually shipped and money was just embezzled and all these different companies are in on the scam.  All named on the same BL to obfuscate the reality that no one actually bought a damn thing.</p>

<p>This is why this particular child-care places sucks so much ass- they just don&#39;t care and utilize it to funnel state/city funds.  They got a guy in city hall to make any citations go away.  Then they utilize some off-shore chinese manufacturer to buy obscene amounts of &#39;stuff&#39; so money is now off their corporate books and in their pockets.</p>

<p>B) Considering they have some ex-military contractor possibly in charge of their chinese shipment, probably just a large drug trafficking ring.  I mean, almost 8,000KG is a LOT of drugs.  We&#39;ve got 5 cities (companies) that we know of all named on the same BL.  If some of that is going to our guy in SLC, then he&#39;s running some major product.  To run that much product, you would need a business that a) didn&#39;t cost much to upkeep b) had very specific clientele do limit foot traffic.  With that much product, you also need a lot of people to help move it.  Those people tend to have kids, so BAM, day-care!  All the kids there are just the kids of the people who run the drugs.  Inspectors come in and see kids, so &quot;ok, it&#39;s a day-care&quot; meanwhile, they don&#39;t care about sanitation, training, immunizations or actually supervising them because they&#39;re friends of the family, so it&#39;s all good.  Not to mention our guy also works in city hall to grease those wheels (as per scenario A) and you have a pretty good front for drugs.  Add to that the possibility that laundromat across the street is involved in some capacity, since it&#39;s been busted before.</p>

<p>EDIT:  I just did some basics maths on this one.  Assuming it&#39;s heroin alone,  that could be nearly street value of $5,120,000,000 (assuming $80/g, I have no idea how much a g would cost nowadays).  1 tril from each distribution node.  The fact that a pedo lives at an address where one of these shipments was received starts to make a LOT more sense.  Folks on the register have a very hard time landing a legit job.  This scenario is starting to look a lot more likely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can we talk about how 8,000 kg is not just heavy, but that much mass is bound to take up a LOT of space. A huge truck would have had to stop there to drop that kind of package off. For instance, a solid block of iron that is 1m x 1m x 1m is roughly 8,000 kg. It&#39;s also the equivalent weight of <strong>6 Ford Fiesta&#39;s</strong>.</p>

<p>There is only one Bill Kallaus Listed in the US several Willam Kalllaus tho most of them Iowa in the same area. Except one William J Kallaus is listed as a board member for the county government but also on another site says he died in 1945.</p>

<p>Thats a link to the business license listed to William Kallaus </p>

<p>If you go to the website for the Bait shop according to iowa workforce business website <a href="http://iwin.iwd.state.ia.us/iowa/employers?uniqueid=825418403&amp;amp;area=000103&amp;amp;stfips=19&amp;amp;sizeclass=A">http://iwin.iwd.state.ia.us/iowa/employers?uniqueid=825418403&amp;amp;area=000103&amp;amp;stfips=19&amp;amp;sizeclass=A</a></p>

<p>you get this. <a href="http://funcrest.com/">http://funcrest.com/</a> Chinese company.</p>

<p>Now that could be just a silly person typing in an incorrect address but it is interesting.</p>

<p>The Sex Offender could be living in the Campground located on the Bait shop property. Apparently they have a large area there that harbors people for long periods. It is interesting that a possible sex slave ring tied to overseas companies tied to this company has a sex offender tied to it..... Im working on more research and will post more below about whatever else i find.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s VERY odd that a container coming from China landed in Vriginia and not in California... Logisticaly it doesn&#39;t add up... I&#39;ve personally only ever dealt with ports in TX, NY and CA. CA ports (again, in my expereince) want to do ever examination possible on every single container that goes through. X-ray, tail gate, and sometimes, even more detailed than that. Doesn&#39;t matter how good your papers look or how long you&#39;ve been bringing the same shit in from the same place they always want to get in there and finger fuck everything. Maybe the port in VA is a little more relaxed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At a stretch, it could be deducted that Fun Stuff Inc is linked to the &#39;Miller heights Co-op&#39;. After looking extensively at forums and any non-official record of individuals writing about the place, I found nothing.</p>

<p>However later on, I realized that the Fun Stuff Inc order form is addressed to Hampton VA - a short drive from the location of this supposed daycare co-op.</p>

<p>THIS COULD BE A COINCIDENCE. However the lack of any intimate information regarding the miller heights spot weirds me the fuck out; espeically since its been around since 1966.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My gut tells me something akin to 2.</p>

<p>It explains a lot, and is completely innocuous enough. I mean these places EXIST, we just don&#39;t really see them. That said, if it is, the worst I&#39;d actually expect is a tiny blip on the federal taxes, covering the costs as they move out and establish a new one. </p>

<p>Arresting or silencing anyone over it would just draw further attention to the location, and make it a dubiously safe location at best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone was pointing the similarity between the (now deceased) funtimekidzkare.com site and the millerheightscoop.com site.</p>

<p>This is easily explained, as that&#39;s a template for websites being sold in several places.</p>

<p>For example, see <a href="http://templateplus24.de/">http://templateplus24.de/</a> (fourth from the top)</p>

<p>EDIT: Other sites with the same template: <a href="http://summercampers.com/">http://summercampers.com/</a> <a href="http://educaraprendendo.xpg.uol.com.br/historia.html">http://educaraprendendo.xpg.uol.com.br/historia.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is easily explained by that being a horrible horrible template, you are correct.</p>

<p>However what it doesn&#39;t explain is how Miller Heights doesn&#39;t exist as a daycare. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a crowdsourced babysitting service for one neighborhood in one city in Virginia. Or that&#39;s how it started. The website explains that they now throw adult parties and activities. </p>

<p>Why would somebody pay money (since 2005 it seems) to host a website advertising something like that when your only audience for such advertisement is your neighbors? And why has their WHOIS info been protected by eNOM? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That can also explain the duplicate &quot;testimonials&quot; and any other strange content - most of those templates come pre-packaged with placeholder content... Lots of businesses don&#39;t bother removing it for one reason or another (don&#39;t know how, didn&#39;t make a final payment to their web designer, forgot or got lazy, etc.) </p>

<p>If they are using a website template and they left some stale placeholder content up there, you can pretty much forget about anything on the site being reliable information. You can also make an assumption that they may have tried to cut corners in other areas of their business setup (licenses, records, etc.) </p>

<p>Source: I sell website templates for a living. Some templates can be in use by 10-1,000&#39;s of different businesses at any point in time. Finding two that never pulled the demo content is only surprising in that you didn&#39;t find a lot more. </p>

<p>Edit: clarity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve probably read every post on here and ATS and even some of the craziness over at 8chan... and as much as I think this is a great thread, very suspenseful, and might actually be on to something bigger than a oddly maintained daycare center... I think you&#39;re all reading WAAAAAY too far into the rabbit sticker on the fence. </p>

<p>As somebody else asked...are NONE of you familiar with sticker street art? That rabbit is clearly a drawing that an artist did (complete with some kind of tag/signature underneath), made stickers of, and posted around town. Not being from SLC or anywhere near, I can&#39;t say how prolific said sticker artist may be...but I honestly think the craziest thing we can focus on here is the significance of &quot;the white rabbit,&quot; &quot;the rabbit hole,&quot; etc. Being a conspiracy sub, obviously these phrases are going to immediately pop into our heads...but do you really think that if there is some seriously dubious operation going on, they&#39;d try to call attention to it by inviting armchair sleuths and conspiracy theorists to &quot;follow the white rabbit down the rabbit hole&quot; of creepy day care conspiracies? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that is odd, if it is in fact true. I&#39;ll believe that claim once I see a picture.  A lot of things seem odd in this case - particularly the immediate scrubbing of info from the internet...but they could also just have gotten word of all of the claims being made online and decided to remove the sticker, as it became a hot topic of discussion here and on ATS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While part of me would like to believe we&#39;ve stumbled upon some front for The Finders, if that were the case, they&#39;ve already closed up, moved on, and left behind a good cover.  This could easily explain the removal of net presence and scrubbing WHOIS info and leaving behind misdirections such as the sticker.</p>

<p>Chances are however, it&#39;s just some people trying to scam money from the local gov/state/fed and they&#39;re trying to cover their tracks and get rid of as much stuff as possible that&#39;s been posted on the internet, both info and stuff around the &#39;day care&#39;.  I have reached out to some in this thread who say they are local, to at least confirm the removal of the sticker, if for no other reason than to just add to the whole &#39;wtf&#39; factor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. Chances are - if something is actually arye here - it is something much less sinister than a child sex slave trafficking ring...something like tax evasion or scamming the government out of benefit $$$. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anybody&#39;s going to uncover any bombshells at this point. If it was actually some insane conspiracy with underground tunnels and sex dungeons (which I&#39;d say is pretty much a 1/1,000,000 chance considering all of the other more mundane crimes that could elicit the same defensive/mysterious response from an owner), there has surely been enough time to clean house and get rid of all evidence. </p>

<p>My best guesses are that either 1) this is simply a failed/failing business with godawful architecture and was all exaggerated by anonymous parties on Reddit and egged on by trolls to begin with or 2) the owners are involved in shady monetary schemes and now are feeling the heat. </p>

<p>People talking about going on stakeouts or touring the daycare while armed with a concealed carry are absolutely out of their  gourd and need to find a fucking hobby.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do we know that anyone HASN&#39;T ever seen this before? I mean...sure...there have been plenty of people here and on infinitychan claiming to be in the SLC area who aren&#39;t familiar with this rabbit sticker...but lets be real. I am a graffiti fanatic, and I still see stickers and tags that are new to me all of the time...and I&#39;m always looking out for stuff...Bottom line is you, I, or anybody else in this thread may have seen this sticker before somewhere and not even processed it or paid it any attention because our brains didn&#39;t have a reason to give a shit. </p>

<p>PS I gave you an upboat because I appreciate the Devil&#39;s Advocate POV...but it goes both ways. It is MORE likely that this sticker exists in other places, yet none of us have noticed it or realized.</p>

<p>There are other reasons I don&#39;t think this is graffiti art. For example the detail of the mean looking eye vs. the rest of the drawing, and the human initials underneath (or possibly looks like a carrot &amp; a string). Just my speculation. </p>

<p>Not that I agreed that should have been done, but the admin&#39;s reasoning, at least on the surface, seems a bit more reasonable. i.e. nationally covered tragedy where supposedly a large number of young children were just murdered...vs....</p>

<p>This...</p>

<p>A single, small, maybe not functioning daycare center that&#39;s so far generated 3, honestly, small posts.

    <div class="md"><p>Mod here from <a href="/r/SaltLakeCity">/r/SaltLakeCity</a>.   </p>

<p>To clarify a few things because this is getting out of hand. </p>

<p>I messaged the mods of this subreddit and <a href="/u/mr_dong">/u/mr_dong</a> removed the thread that <a href="/u/Ambiguously_Ironic">/u/Ambiguously_Ironic</a> later restored. No admin conspiracy there. </p>

<p>The thread was removed from <a href="/r/SaltLakeCity">/r/SaltLakeCity</a> because harassing or conspiring to harass individuals or businesses, no matter how &quot;sketchy&quot; some random redditor thinks it is, violated rule number 5 of our subreddit and general principals of decency. There&#39;s some content posted that also violated rule number 6, which goes along with Reddit&#39;s policy about no posting personal information. </p>

<p>Now there are talks of people taking pictures, breaking in, and doing other obnoxious things to some place that is probably just a victim of unfortunate circumstances. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t care about that business or whatever you people think is weird about it.  I just don&#39;t want this to turn into another incident where Reddit&#39;s over eager pitchfork mobs cause some negative publicity event and cause undue stress to people that have no idea what this site even is.</p>

<p>A common sense perspective on this would suggest that this is just a really poorly run business that you people are harassing. </p>

<p>Edit: Since apparently it matters, not some throwaway account.  Been an active member of Reddit for 6 years, seen some really stupid stuff happen that I&#39;d like to not see happen again.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, objectively I&#39;m absolutely shocked at the lengths some people will go to alleviate their own boredom. This is half users needing to get a life and half users needing to stop fucking with others lives. </p>

<p>My favorite theory so far is the drug cartel money laundering front... Because like 5 NIMBY soccer moms and armchair sleuths have never seen someone go in or out. &quot;Concerned citizens&quot; my ass, you all need to mind your own damn business. That&#39;s analogous with me posting a picture of one of these NIMBY&#39;s oddly colored house and stirring the pot into making everyone believe that person is a child pornographer and starting a witch hunt because, secretly, I&#39;m the president of their neighborhood HOA and don&#39;t like the color of theist house. Not only is this a very large conclusion to jump to, anyone approaching the location of a cartel building and peering into windows is just a dead man walking... As if they didn&#39;t have surveillance to watch for shit like that. </p>

<p>Or the armchair in front of a tv that people are implying is used to watch pedophilia on CCTV... More like a god damn way to monitor bratty fucking kids, watch soap operas, and be left the fuck alone. </p>

<p>Seriously, for all the participants in this thread, if you&#39;re that concerned call the police. It&#39;s not your job to investigate a damn thing, half of what you&#39;ll find won&#39;t even be right, most of you are too caught up in the mass hysteria going on here to be able to step back and see that MAAAAYYYYBE this is just a little bit too much, and you all need a break from the constant reminder of government surveillance. Go watch some cat videos. </p>

<p>And you, to whom I am replying, thank you for removing that thread from your sub. The fact this remains here is totally appalling to me, and seriously tarnishes the image of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> in my mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay? It&#39;s entirely the same situation. Perhaps the child was the subject of a custody dispute. Perhaps the child was involved in a lawsuit related to being in a wheelchair. Perhaps the child had been abused, and was in foster care. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.    </p>

<p>The takeaway is that the child&#39;s identity and privacy are respected. All of those situations are far more plausible than the ones that have popped up. I agree that this center is odd, and that there are very weird things about it--but keeping the identities of minor children private isn&#39;t one of them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The business keeping the identity of the child private isn&#39;t strange, no.</p>

<p>If Child A goes to the daycare, the child will have to get to know the handicapped boy (as kids at daycare do), especially since it&#39;s just them two, and eventually they will probably tell the parents about the boy. Contractually barring that parent from telling anyone (friends, family, other parents who ask about the daycare...) about the one boy that their child goes to daycare with is strange. Parents will talk to other parents about who their kids go to daycare with. It&#39;s a normal conversation. If placing a gag order on someone doing that seems reasonable to you, then I don&#39;t know what else to say. </p>

<p>Just a coincidence huh? Seems she transferred it to her husband/brother &quot;Jose Solano&quot; as <a href="https://secure.utah.gov/bes/action/details?entity=8529119-0160">Fun Time Child Care, LLC</a> on 12/28/2012 until current. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Edit:  Here, inside pictures that I&#39;m sure you can match up the windows to the outside pictures (kids have been removed via post-it notes):</strong>
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/voZTB">Pictures</a></p>

<p><em>Sigh</em>, I&#39;m not posting this on my main account because (no offense) some of y&#39;all seem a little wacky.  </p>

<p>I used to work at this building in 1994/1995 when I was 18.  It was definitely just a daycare then, I can not vouch for what it may or may not be now.  HOWEVER, all of y&#39;all going on and on about the NAME &quot;Fun Time&quot; being a whole huge conspiracy thing are completely off base.  It was called &quot;Fun Time Day Care&quot; back then, and the name was clearly just kept and slightly changed.  I even remember getting prank calls from guys &quot;Hey baby, I&#39;m looking for a Fun Time&quot;.  </p>

<p>It was owned by a guy named Rick, don&#39;t remember his last name.  He was a maybe 40ish Mormon white guy.  Nice enough guy.  The place mostly had low-income families, and a lot of them were on state assistance.  I&#39;d say 90% of the kids/families were white.  The building was NOT bright green back then, it was a non-descript cream color and people were always tagging the side of the building, so I&#39;d venture to guess that&#39;s why it was eventually painted green.  </p>

<p>The room with all the covered up windows was the older kids&#39; room.  The room at the back of the building was the babies &amp; y 1-2 year olds room, and the third room (not counting kitchen/bath, this is on the far side of the building from this picture) was the 2/3 year olds.  There is also like a little &quot;lobby&quot; at the front door where the time clock and other such stuff was.  </p>

<p>Anyhow, my point is, stop being so creeped out by the fact that it LOOKS like a daycare but it may not actually be one.  It LOOKS like a daycare because it WAS a daycare, for a very long time.  No, we didn&#39;t used to cover up the windows the way it&#39;s covered now, but we did put artwork up in the windows - partially just to block out the sun but also so that we could try and pretend we weren&#39;t at a busy street corner, ya know?  </p>

<p>I loved working at this place, I just hated getting paid $4.25 an hour.  Loved the kids, and the other &quot;teachers&quot; were nice enough, although I can honestly say I was the only one that truly loved being there...  which, you know, ALL day care workers should love working with children, but you need to pay them more than minimum wage to get them to stick around. </p>

<p>I have pictures of the kids from back then, so I have plenty of interior shots of the place.  However, since they ALL have pictures of little kids in them, I&#39;m sure you can imagine why I wouldn&#39;t want to post any of them.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s made me really sad to see all these posts about a place I have such fond memories of.</p>

<p>PS  I don&#39;t live in Salt Lake anymore, so I can not go spy on the place for you, sorry.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, because MY story is the one that sounds outlandish.  I have no idea what the place is now, I was simply offering up personal experience that it did in fact used to be a perfectly normal daycare.  I&#39;m pretty sure THAT is a matter of public record, so I didn&#39;t say anything that can&#39;t be easily proven.</p>

<p>I only felt compelled to post because honestly, it really did make me sad to see all these weird conspiracies about the place.  When I saw the headline in the &quot;scary things that happened on reddit&quot; thread I clicked on it because it was Salt Lake, and was rather shocked to find it was a picture of a building I know so well. </p>

<p>Anyhow, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll continue to believe whatever you want to believe.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if behind that post it note is the meth lab?   And who takes a picture while their food sits on the table getting cold?  Especially spaghetti which is terrible cold.  Unless what is behind that post it note is an animal sacrifice and that is what is in your bowl.  Take a look at those pictures sheeple??  We have two options.  One is that it really is a daycare and everyone is overreacting.  Two is that it is a Illuminati hideout where they make meth while sacrificing animals which they turn in to spaghetti and eat as they plot to overthrow us all.  Take a look at that balloon animal, it is pointed right signifying death.  And if you notice in the other picture the word &quot;chain&quot; is written.  No my friends, the truth is right in front of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No way their website is legitimate. It lacks all useful information on what their curriculum actually is, and what their activities are. It&#39;s just the address of the building, and fluff.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our curriculum is focus on</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A grammatical error. You think this would have been corrected at some point since 2005.</p>

<p>Also of note is the similarly terrible website for that toy company, which is a bit more detailed, but its catalog is password-protected. Typically businesses don&#39;t hide their products. You can&#39;t even order stuff online. You can print a pdf of an order form, fill it out, and fax it or scan it and send it via email. It doesn&#39;t list the specific brands of toys they sell, or any sort of legitimate confirmation it&#39;s an actual toy company. There&#39;s a vague &quot;pirates&quot; category, which is just a picture of a very broad assortment of pirate-related toys, but is not professional at all. Possibly a stock photo?</p>

<p>It&#39;s just weird, especially for a company that claims itself to be such a major player in its industry. All the pictures of its products look like weird stock photos, as do the pictures on the childcare website. It would be interesting to actually try and order something from the toy website to see if it&#39;s real. Of course, this requires access to the catalog of things they SELL. Maybe somebody can contact the company through the one page that isn&#39;t protected, and get the information? Even if it proves to be an actual toy company, it&#39;s one of the most solid leads we have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wholesale businesses frequently password protect their catalogs, so that potential customers cannot browse and comparison shop cheap foreign goods from a number of suppliers.

Not to detract from the overarching weirdness of the childcare place w/o no kids in it, but nothing you&#39;ve brought up is strange at all for wholesalers who deal with cheap foreign junk. </p>

<p>There is a fake house in my parents expensive neighborhood that is a Department of Water and Power substation in disguise. </p>

<p>The Feds rented property from someone I know personally in the mid 90&#39;s under the name Emerald Empire. Emerald Empire was part of a customs operation called &quot;Casablanca&quot; which was tracking money laundering through the Cali Cartel.   Amada Carrillo Fuentes was killed in suspicious circumstances a year before the raid to protect informants and or faked his death to retire safely depending on who you believe. I was working in the same industrial complex As Emerald Empire for years and didn&#39;t know a thing was going on until after the bust. They seized more than a hundred million dollars in the bust. Banks were in on it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bancomer, Banca Serfin and Confia banks were indicted along with more than a dozen low- and mid-level bankers accused of knowingly laundering what they thought were proceeds from the Cali and Juarez drug cartels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In September a company called QT Maternity was wired  100,000 and 40,000 as part of a sting into the Sinaloa cartel leading to a kidnapping rescue and another hundred million dollar seizure.</p>

<p>I used to do loan servicing for creditors, go out look at properties inspect the condition take a few notes and pictures and move on. A coworker got called by the FBI following up on why he was photographing one of their unmarked properties.</p>

<p>Feds are not very creative they have purchased and or rented property as the State of Virginia Procurement Agency , or the Maryland Procurement Agency.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.skylinenet.net/">http://www.skylinenet.net/</a> Skyline technology delivers live video feeds to law enforcement and first responders but happens to have the exact same physical address as <a href="http://www.sentinel-health.com/">http://www.sentinel-health.com/</a> both claim to be operating at the same place and. Jeffrie (google the last name yourself)) current Skyline employee has done government contract work for intelligence agencies</p>

<p>Look into INSLAW/PROMIS </p>

<p>Ever heard of Evergreen Airways?</p>

<p>PERMINDEX?</p>

<p>Conspiracy corners of the web have pretty decent lists of CIA fronts.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m on board with the guy who says he worked a51. There is secret shit going on in the world. There is probably secret shit being done at this daycare. Who does secret shit? Most people who do secret shit are not harmless.  and by and large its best to just &quot;Move along folks&quot;.</p>

<p>Let alone the fact that if all of these photos people are taking and posting were taken from cell phone cameras, they&#39;re being geotagged exactly where those photos were taken. The metadata can be extracted and the owner of the phone could conceivably be located... But let&#39;s not pay any attention to the fact that, collectively, this sub is wholly against government surveillance and is for privacy rights, yet lacks the mechanism of cognitive dissonance to see where protecting and already anonymous usernames friend that ADMITTEDLY COMMITTED A CRIME and accusing a business owner of being a child pornograoher or a manufacturer of drugs while posting their name, business address, phone numbers etc don&#39;t match up in ideology! I don&#39;t give a fuck if they DO say it&#39;s &quot;public knowledge&quot;. Pulling the data from those photos could also be considered public knowledge. </p>

<p>Nothing wrong with the building. Might be a little outdated and haggard but I have seen trailers used as day cares before. You are not going to get the schedule of the facility unless you have a child there, that is common sense since it prevents pedos from stalking the place. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2u343a/the_slc_day_care_shipping_container_and/co4t2yl">The shipment has nothing to do with the day care check out my post here</a>. There was children activity taken by a redditor. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What kind of paper trail would you like? The day care is obviously a day care cited by the numerous fines they have had over the years (which are quite high but not completely out of the norm). Again, the shipment has nothing to do with the day care at all. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Meh, no one is really going to give a shit for the most part. This is a day care located in not so great area of SLC. While it may not be 100% or a place you bring your kid they are certified to receive kids through the government services. That would be impossible to do if they were not suitable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s no harm in an audit, given that we&#39;re talking about children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree there is no harm to audit but when you are calling, sending pizzas, taking creepy pictures through the windows, and stalking the place it becomes a concern of safety for the children. You are more likely to be arrested for stalking or whatever than this place to be shut down for being unsuited for children.</p>

<p>Additionally, many of the links in the require authorization, including the Online Catalog and Online Catalog Cont. <strong>What type of online retailer (1) can&#39;t fit all their items into 1 catalog page on a website and (2) wouldn&#39;t want potential effing customers looking at their inventory without authorization?</strong> Obviously a front, no business is intentionally that bad at marketing.</p>

<p>Additionally, the <a href="http://www.funstuffinc.net/uploads/order_form.pdf">order form</a> is about as empty as possible and requires the purchaser to enter items, prices, cc info, and everything else. </p>

<p>This is total guesswork here, but on the site the title says &quot;FUN STUFF&quot; subtitled &quot;The name says it all.&quot; If this is truly a trafficking ring, it would be a semi-clever name to hide the meaning &quot;F you and stuff&quot; hinting at sexual services being offered.

They&#39;re aimed at people who own dollar stores, run county fair booths, small party stores, etc., they are <em>not</em> retail level suppliers at all. I mean, you can call one of these places up, set up an account in 4 minutes and browse their catalog all you want--but you actually have to talk to a human being. ;) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been a parakeet for the propaganda manure spreader.</p>

<p>I have spread lies, unknowingly, thinking I was helping expose the truth.</p>

<p>I have believed information I did not confirm for myself</p>

<p>This is really bad practice. This can drive a person downwards. This is destructive. This is herd mentality...</p>

<p>and it is exactly what they want.</p>

<p>But hey... by all means. Keep proving that you are easily tricked. It&#39;s true. 9/11 was fucked. The elite do rape kids. There is, has been, or will be atleast ONE daycare in Salt Lake City Utah, that is a front of some sort. Whether it be abusing kids, laundering money, or counterfeiting muffin mix. Whether it be a front for the CIA, the KGB, Mexican Cartels, Networks of trans-human Satanists and their carefully crafted spawn...</p>

<p>Man... if you thought it... it&#39;s happened. And if you thought it, you are capable of these crimes yourself.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s catch these fuckers. Let&#39;s make them pay too. I agree. Let&#39;s be smart about it. Let&#39;s all contribute something, and rest in thoughtful contemplation before submitting to excitable tendencies.</p>

<p>Chase the rabbit indeed... but please be careful... for the rabbit is bait. And you are not the hunter. You are the hunted.</p>

<p>ALSO: It&#39;s human trafficking awareness month... if this SLC Saga is simply a thought project... or ARG... it&#39;s a damn good one. And it&#39;s raising awareness.</p>

<p>&#39;Cause now I wanna find out all the criminal fronts happening in my own town!</p>

<p>I know nothing of magick or sigil power, or thought control. But it seems that this has been quite a good project, should it all be a &quot;troll&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ooooh yeah, this place.  I lived near there for years and always considered it to be creepy level 1000.  After years of being around it, the pics I&#39;ve seen in this thread are the <em>only</em> time I&#39;ve ever seen kids in/around it.  I honestly thought it was out of business but being maintained by the property owner.</p>

<p>That all said, I am not so sure anything sinister is going on other than the possibility of it being used as a front for something not child related.  It&#39;s in a pretty heavily trafficked area and I think it&#39;d be difficult for them to set up a child trafficking outpost there.  You never know though.  The feeling I got from that place reminded me of the &quot;day care&quot; in Silent Hill 4...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoever runs the website IMMEDIATELY taking down the site and scrubbing their info from WhoIs IP lookup once the initial post went up. That&#39;s pretty weird to me. </p>

<p>But as I said..everything seems off. Yea, these could all be a series of coincidences or some small time crime like tax evasion or something. This time yesterday I wasn&#39;t convinced it was anything more than a shitty day care. But the links to the Chinese shipping shit..the dude who works for that toy import company having his previous job be for a defense contractor....ummm what? That is a strange transition in the job market if you ask me.</p>

<p>Honestly though, if you&#39;re that interested, do your own research and analysis. There&#39;s plenty of info here...no need for other Redditors to spoon feed it to you.</p>

<p>This is weird to me as well. Definitely odd and worth taking a look at. Just playing devil&#39;s advocate though, maybe they scrubbed the info to keep themselves from getting doxxed by internet trolls? Could be a possibility. A lot of odd circumstances surrounding this place, but I&#39;m still going to reserve judgement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I find odd is the person who managed to get pictures of the inside of the building:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It&#39;s a weekday</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s still winter, so it gets dark early-ish and it&#39;s still light out in the pics that were posted</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that it&#39;s during the day on a weekday, there should be kids inside</p></li>
<li><p>There are no kids inside</p></li>
<li><p>All the chairs are stacked inside</p></li>
<li><p>Cardboard covering most of the windows does not seem like the kind of environment I&#39;d want my child in</p></li>
<li><p>Some people claiming kids are only for WFS families, some claiming that that is a lie - just the fact that there&#39;s some question about that seems suspicious</p></li>
<li><p>Some person in <a href="/r/panichistory">/r/panichistory</a> said it was a business purchased by a son to keep his 72 year old mother busy and not-lonely, which sounds all well and good - but odd that if it&#39;s supposed to be keeping her busy with kids running around, why are there no kids running around?</p></li>
<li><p>You&#39;re right about the &quot;4 possibly unobservant people never saw anyone go in or out,&quot; but only at face value. It might be entirely possible for people to not see people going in or out, but the fact that there is actually no one inside the building during work hours on a weekday means that, indeed, there are no people going in or out (save the cleaning lady (?))</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I&#39;m willing to concede that it may indeed be a daycare that&#39;s operated by a 72 year old woman to keep her busy and that she&#39;s just doing a really shitty job at it. But if she&#39;s doing a shitty job at it, at the very least, she shouldn&#39;t be in charge. These are kids for christ&#39;s sake, someone competent should be in charge, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Found more information on Jose Solano.</p>

<p>According to LeadFerret (<a href="http://leadferret.com/directory/person/jose-solano/11037334">http://leadferret.com/directory/person/jose-solano/11037334</a>), Solano is the Web Master at Salt Lake City Corporation. Is it standard practice to call your public utilities provider a Corporation in America? Because I found no website specific to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on a Google search for Jose Solano, I have found he is a webmaster for &#39;Salt Lake City Corporation&#39;, which I&#39;m pretty sure we already knew. The address that is given for his residence is the same as the daycare. The reason that was interesting to me was that the daycare was not mentioned anywhere else in the particular information sheet for Solano. </p>

<p>EDIT: LINK: <a href="http://www.intelius.com/people/Jose-Solano/0ccnrrdr8d3">http://www.intelius.com/people/Jose-Solano/0ccnrrdr8d3</a></p>

<p>EDIT 2: Another website <a href="http://www.corporationwiki.com/Utah/Salt-Lake-City/jose-solano/124393341.aspx">http://www.corporationwiki.com/Utah/Salt-Lake-City/jose-solano/124393341.aspx</a> shows corporate affiliations for SLC Corp. Also shows a Jose E Solano in Provo, Utah for Chunga International, LLC. </p>

<p>One of the affiliations he had was Jun Fan. Jun Fan seems to be connected to multiple Asian companies as well. I seem to remember there being shipments from Asia somewhere in the comments/threads.</p>

<p>Not sure what all of this means, but this all look like shell companies to me.</p>

<p>EDIT 3: Seems that a Jose Solano got a divorce back in 2001 in the Provo district. (possibly useless info.) <a href="http://utahsright.com/divorceprofile.php?id=30448">http://utahsright.com/divorceprofile.php?id=30448</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The citations list in this link shows numerous incidents of the day care director failing to provide current licensing credentials (in 4/2008 the center is cited after routine inspection for this and a half dozen other offenses, usually revolving around lack of sufficient supervision for the 8-12 kids in the center...citation states that current cert must be provided by 6/08. There is no followup until 2009, where director once again has expired or invalid license...)
At least every time the inspectors come there are actually children present in the day care..</p>

<p>Of course, there is also this complaint logged in that list:
Fun Time Kidz Kare
Address: 1248 South 300 East, UT 84111
Provider Type: Center Child Care
Phone: 801-467-9988
Initial License Date: 05/23/2005
Citation Date: 08/30/2007
Survey Type: Complaint
Rule 100-19(4)(b):06: Discipline measures shall not include any of the following: restraining a child`s movement by binding, tying, or any other form of restraint that exceeds that specified in Subsection (3) above.
Findings: Upon licensing arrival, Margene was observed yelling at a boy on the swingset. A representative from DDI, Charlene, entered the facility 20 minutes later. Charlene informed licensing that Margene was outside yelling at the children. Once Margene brought the children inside the center, she continued yelling at the children to sit on the rug. This item must be corrected by September 5, 2007.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I cannot find a physical address. If you google day care in Oakton VA, Miller Heights Coop is not a result. My phone is not loading the map correctly but the map on their website seems to point to a location inside a park (difficult run stream valley park). Perhaps one of you with a better phone can check the map on their about us page. There are no pics of the business on the website. As explained elsewhere in this thread, it is obviously a copied website, but there is no physical location for this business.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This saga was damned intriguing until somebody pointed out that the shipping website was crap, rendering the conspiratorial element of this mull and void. The other four businesses became irrelevant, the shipping container becomes irrelevant and we&#39;re back to caviling about a shady daycare which is likely a run of the mill money haven/ tax dodge, like most registered small businesses are. The fact that people are now rambling on this thread about cults, rabbit symbols, hidden messages and the sinister import of the topography of Hudson bay indicates that the real show is over and now the midgets are doing tricks for change. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are not &quot;rambling on&quot;, they&#39;re genuinely curious and are throwing around different ideas and tangents to try and get some leads.</p>

<p>Why are the 4 other businesses irrelevant? I must have missed that part, explain if you would. </p>

<p>Here are the 4, with the exact same BL number each time:</p>

<p><a href="http://fonroid.com/canonical.jsp?id=33759053&amp;amp;year=2013&amp;amp;consignee=funcrest-bait-shop">Funcrest Bait Shop</a></p>

<p><a href="http://fonroid.com/canonical.jsp?id=32762087&amp;amp;year=2013&amp;amp;consignee=fundamental-financial-group">Fundamental Financial</a></p>

<p><a href="http://fonroid.com/canonical.jsp?id=27299049&amp;amp;year=2013&amp;amp;consignee=fun-with-phonics">Fun with Phonics</a></p>

<p><a href="http://fonroid.com/canonical.jsp?id=38000261&amp;amp;year=2013&amp;amp;consignee=funland-jumpers">Funland Jumpers</a></p>

<p>Also, there are more elements of conspiracy, which you claim to be &quot;mull and void&quot;, so please explain:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>multiple failed inspections, with minimal penalties, then none after 2011</p></li>
<li><p>name aliases for the parties with government involvement</p></li>
<li><p>all of the initial threats to stop looking into this</p></li>
<li><p>no way to actually register a child here</p></li>
<li><p>the address for one of the above is the EXACT same as a convicted pedophile </p></li>
<li><p>another involved party is an ex-military contractor </p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, until you present sound explanations for all of those, there remains plenty of conspiracy potential.</p>

Facebook Page for A Chunga Company. Only company ive been able to find with that name so I assume its the same one. Written in the description is.
&quot;Civil engineering,Road construction,projects,production,general contracts,consultant&quot;
Also listed are several phone numbers.
&quot;77508032 , 75728299, 77238863&quot;
None of these seem to be valid american phone numbers. Maybe for fax or something but i have no way to tell.
9 pictures are posted on their page. 8 of these pictures are tagged as being in Adamaoua, Cameroon and show what seems to be several construction projects in that town. Album is titled &quot;Work in progress with viettel cameroon sall&quot;
9th picture is a tagged photo by a man named Mula Fordip Divine. Picture is of a slightly open metal cabinet on a faux wood wall with a door next to it. The Company commented saying &quot;New Office&quot;. The cameroon photos were posted November 26 2013 while the office picture is dated May 4th 2014 making this picture the most recent activity in this group.
I also did some research into the names mentioned in the building album title. Viettel Mobile is the largest Phone service provider in Vietnam. I found mention of the cameroon company as follows.
&quot;It won a contract in Cameroon in December 2012, which it bid for in a joint-venture with Bestinver Cameroon S.A.R.L.&quot;
This sentence cites this article in the Newspaper &quot;Vietnam Voice.&quot;
<a href="http://english.vov.vn/Economy/Viettel-gets-Cameroon-telecom-contract/251490.vov">http://english.vov.vn/Economy/Viettel-gets-Cameroon-telecom-contract/251490.vov</a>
Chunga is not mentioned in either the Wiki article nor the newspaper article. This is probably a bit far fetched but there is mention of a Taiwanese Telecommunications company called Chungwa Telecom
&quot;In May 2007 Chunghwa Telecom Co., Ltd. established a joint venture with Viettel Mobile to provide Internet data center services in Vietnam.&quot;
Most likely unrelated but the name similarity makes it worth mentioning.
Very little of note on the facebook page excluding that it has 11 likes (including myself) and has no text posts only photos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After reading the original (now deleted) thread and everything else I could find regarding this Daycare, it seems to me like someone bought this place in 2006 with the intent on running a legit Daycare and simply got in over their heads. It looks like they simply failed to maintain the place the way it was ran before, and eventually their clients left as a reflection of the poor manner in which it was being run. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure the person who owns it now probably loves all of this negative attention and people implying that he&#39;s doing everything from laundering money to running a meth lab. That&#39;s exactly what you want people to think about your unsuccessful Daycare center. </p>

<p>IMO, these threads and this &quot;conspiracy&quot; is simply a matter of kicking a guy when he&#39;s obviously already down. That&#39;s just my opinion though. And whether or not that one redditor who people found was ex-military and speaks 8 languages or whatever: first of all, who&#39;s to say if that guy really is affiliated with that place. For all we know, he could be blowing smoke. Or, maybe he actually owns the place and is trying to disuade people from calling his freaking Daycare center a shady cult in disguise, or a crack den, or whatever the latest off the wall conspiracy is.</p>

<p>edit: And now I see that I&#39;m responding to a thread that is over a month old and everyone has probably forgotten all about this by now. FML. Hope I didn&#39;t reawaken a ridiculous &quot;conspiracy&quot; by trying to defend the place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just how near they are to certain government facilities. I definitely could have worded it better. I know that if you expand the radius of someplace you&#39;ll eventually hit a federal/state building but with the connection of the websites being similar and the VA one being so near to DC makes it an odd connection. So I remembered the NSA facility in Utah and checked out where it was. I&#39;ve never been to the area so I don&#39;t know the distances timewise, but it&#39;s an interesting coincidence nonetheless. I just wanted to point it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If something in OP&#39;s story/the claims that have been made by other Redditors since then implicate a government agency, I would say, by all means, follow that lead. </p>

<p>But just aimlessly looking to tie a (seemingly innocent, yet spooky looking) day care center to a government agency that specializes in computer surveillance and data collection is the kind of thing that makes people roll their eyes at &quot;conspiracy theorists.&quot;  There&#39;s no intelligent reason to do so. There is only &quot;well, I know they are in the same state...and...thats spooky!&quot; </p>

<p>I would say the best way to go about making a government connection to a supposed conspiracy is to NOT make a government connection to said conspiracy unless there is actually a reason to. In this case, there is no reason - other than the fact that somebody who MAY have something to do with ownership of the day care may also have been a webmaster for a company that worked on a local election campaign.  </p>

<p>TL;DR: not everything is an NSA/FBI/CIA conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now you&#39;re twisting my words. </p>

<p>I am a BIG advocate of distrusting ALL parts of the government.</p>

<p>What I do NOT advocate is making random connections between private day cares and completely unrelated data collection centers that happen to be located in the same state. How do you not understand that? I was trying to be cordial with my initial responses to you but I guess there is no getting through to you.  </p>

<p>This is why people can&#39;t stand modern day &quot;conspiracy theorists.&quot; Most people who identify as such would rather just blame everything on spoopy government agencies than use their brain to connect facts....and this is coming from somebody who is very critical of our government! You need to learn when it is appropriate to draw such connections, otherwise you are throwing the entire movement under the bus with your ignorance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But why what? Nobody knows why they ditched their website and scrubbed the Whois info within hours of them being discussed on here. That is part of the mystery. As for the page that currently exists..that is an extremely typical format for a dead webpage and a way for whoever still owns the domain to attempt to collect ad revenue from clicks to other sites while not actively running the site themselves. It is really common across the net, I am surprised you&#39;ve never seen a junk page like that before. </p>

Okay, so we know that mysteriously large shipments are being delivered to said building, correct?
And that these shipments are more than likely coming from China.
Perhaps, due to the language barrier, the building was painted to stand out to delivery-men, preventing confusion with directions? I don&#39;t know, I just thought it was odd.</p>

Pass the DLAB over a 150 your going to take a trip to some places (that&#39;s all I am going to say.) My brain is wired for languages. Can I read all of them? no, Can I speak them, yes. I have an audio graphic memory It is very easy for me to remember words and things that are verbally said with 94% recall. I am white.I am not Hindi or Pakistani I grew up in Vermont. Moved to utah in my late high school years. Graduated early with packets. joined the Airforce at 17years old. I was not stationed at A51 I was only there for like a week. (Can not say anymore than that) Am I involved in this day care stuff? No, Hell no. Its just In my experience From what I was doing after the USAF. These places are bad news. Its easy to identify when something is up. no one walking in or out of the doors, lack of change for decades, etc. and since the thread I have done my own research. as for the people calling me a phoney because I am 24 and I bothered to actually seize the opportunities that were in front of me learned those languages went to A51 and jumped out of airplanes for a living for 4 years doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t possible. I have seen some seriously fucked up shit, It wasn&#39;t a cake walk. DLI,Jump school, S.E.R.E school, and Goodfellow AFB. did someone fuck up my DD214? I think so but I have to go to DC with a Lawyer to have a chance at that to get changed. </p>

<p><strong>I have no idea what is going on in there all I know is that it is bad news.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I didn&#39;t give a warning because I knew what was going on and telling people to stay away</strong></p>

<p><strong>I don&#39;t care if you believe me or not I don&#39;t need the approval of online strangers</strong> </p>

<p>He didn&#39;t do all those schools. I mean each of the languages takes over a year of class. Arabic alone takes two years from start till you finish and get to your duty station. And NOBODY learns more than one lang in an enlistment. And why such a weird combo? If you learn an Abrahamic language, you stick to them. Urdu, pashtu, farsi, arabic? I get that. But fucking Russian and french? Stop. They just wouldn&#39;t have you do that. Plus SERE, jump, and wtf ever else his is lying about... Another 6+ months each. He is simply too young to have done all that. Plus area 51?!?! The fuck?!?! Never once was the possibility to go 51 brought up by any other linguist I ever met. There is simply nothing there at all for a linguist to do.</p>

<p>Dude is a baffoon. Ignore this clown.</p>

<p>I guess he fell on hard times at some point, because two years ago, despite all this amazing top-secret military training, he said he worked at a coffee shop:</p>

<p>Then he confesses to making up stories for karma on <a href="/r/advice">/r/advice</a> animals, and it all starts to make sense:</p>

<p>The Corps definitely needs them, and your recruiter would do everything he could to get you in. </p>

<p>You have to take the ASVAB to get your GT score first, and if it&#39;s high enough, 90 i think, you can take the DLAB. Good luck dude/ette, hit me up if you have any questions.</p>

<p>Weird! <a href="https://secure.utah.gov/bes/action/details?entity=6966856-0151">La Belle Vie</a> is registered to a &quot;Shevaun Esther Davis&quot;. Was registered on 4/20/2008 and expired in 5/18/2011.</p>

<p>Chunga was founded in 2012, so maybe it became the Solanos&#39; at that point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now you&#39;re twisting my words. </p>

<p>I am a BIG advocate of distrusting ALL parts of the government.</p>

<p>What I do NOT advocate is making random connections between private day cares and completely unrelated data collection centers that happen to be located in the same state. How do you not understand that? I was trying to be cordial with my initial responses to you but I guess there is no getting through to you.  </p>

<p>This is why people can&#39;t stand modern day &quot;conspiracy theorists.&quot; Most people who identify as such would rather just blame everything on spoopy government agencies than use their brain to connect facts....and this is coming from somebody who is very critical of our government! You need to learn when it is appropriate to draw such connections, otherwise you are throwing the entire movement under the bus with your ignorance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems our boy at Funland bouncy place is a little odd too. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.corporationwiki.com/Oregon/Aumsville/sam-shaw/86946449.aspx">http://www.corporationwiki.com/Oregon/Aumsville/sam-shaw/86946449.aspx</a>   Hes listed as Principal. (not owner? but hes thee owner)  However theres several listings for Sam shaw at other companies on that page, maybe different ones but in oregon same name same age.</p>

<p>Sam Shaw is the owner.  The business address seems to be an empty lot in the woods. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/10173+Keene+Ln+SE,+Aumsville,+OR+97325/@44.8699033,-122.853329,218m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m7!1m4!3m3!1s0x54bff74ed17e5bcb:0x13d77ac590778bd5!2s10173+Keene+Ln+SE,+Aumsville,+OR+97325!3b1!3m1!1s0x54bff74ed17e5bcb:0x13d77ac590778bd5">https://www.google.com/maps/place/10173+Keene+Ln+SE,+Aumsville,+OR+97325/@44.8699033,-122.853329,218m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m7!1m4!3m3!1s0x54bff74ed17e5bcb:0x13d77ac590778bd5!2s10173+Keene+Ln+SE,+Aumsville,+OR+97325!3b1!3m1!1s0x54bff74ed17e5bcb:0x13d77ac590778bd5</a></p>

<p>Possible it might be off a little but images were taken recently far as i can tell (2015) and theres nothing there. It is registered as a 4 bedroom house built in 1991. I cant see one and theres nothing around that looks like a bouncy castle business. Its possible this is the mailing address and the business is somewhere else i suppose but even so theres no house there according to google. Their website does say they have ponies so perhaps they are there but i dont see anything.  And the names on the properties dont match.</p>

<p>Looking at the tax records i got this</p>

<p><a href="http://apps.co.marion.or.us/PropertyRecords/PropertySummary.aspx?pid=R28290">http://apps.co.marion.or.us/PropertyRecords/PropertySummary.aspx?pid=R28290</a></p>

<p>its registered to Keenan Benjamin INC. (this is getting strange)
33 acres of property. No business there. Its registereed as farmland. </p>

<p>I looked up the adreess listed on the tax site and it doesnt exist. There is a street in Salem with a similar address but is not exactly right.</p>

<p>THIS IS INTERESTING! <a href="http://yellow-pages.me/OR/funland-inc-128306.html">http://yellow-pages.me/OR/funland-inc-128306.html</a></p>

<p>Upon further search i found that Funland Inc founded by this &quot; Sam Shaw&quot; was at this address and it is listed as GUESS WHAT.... </p>

<p>A child daycare service.  </p>

<p>not a bouncy castle place. this is getting really fucked up now.
<a href="http://or.mingluji.com/business_directory/Funland_Inc">http://or.mingluji.com/business_directory/Funland_Inc</a></p>

<p>The place is suppose to be closed and according to a couple searches is actually a single family home being rented to a man. ( wont post his name) hes been there for 4 years.  There is a woman listed at the same adress with a different last name. Possible girlfriend i guess.</p>

<p>Know what else is interesting... this is close proximity to an elementary school. </p>

<p>So if what i gather may be right this is a small house that was listed as a daycare years back and run out of a home, (if its not just a shell corp which is likely) or the person living there before used this address for whatever reason. </p>

<p>However all the properties this &quot;Sam Shaw&quot; is associated with as owning DO NOT EXIST.  They are listed under other peoples names and addresses but listed as businesses with those address. He has several.</p>

<p>This guy is definatly hiding something weird. All of the businesses that name is associated with is tied to children.</p>

<p>There is a sex offender listed as the same name from another state that they apparently dont know where he is. (not saying its the same guy just coincidence)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ibegin.com/directory/us/oregon/aumsville/shaws-interiors-10173-keene-ln-se/">http://www.ibegin.com/directory/us/oregon/aumsville/shaws-interiors-10173-keene-ln-se/</a>  now hes an interior rug store.. and party store.</p>

<p>TLDR 
Same guy now apparently has a Carpet store.. that is also a party supply store.. that is also interior design.. that is also a kids party place.. that is also a bouncy castle place thats also a farm at the same address, </p>

<p>that&#39;s not in his name (shell company that doesnt exist) whose address is actually a mobile home in a different town, whose associated to a child day care, whose also tied to a shipping company, thats tied to the other weird companies thats tied to sex offenders and possible trafficking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Urdu uses cognates from other languages like Farsi and Arabic most people who speak Hindi may understand Urdu but are unable to read it or understand a few words. For instance the word for family in Urdu is خاندان &quot;Khandan&quot; But in Hindi it is परिवार &quot;Parivāra&quot; most can understand each other. Also Urdu is kind of a bitch because it is not that standardized. in Punjab they may use more Hindi based Urdu where as in Baluchistan your going to get a lot of Farsi in there. they are not the same language but they are very close to each other. Urdu is a hindi based language due to its grammatical structure simple words are going to be the same but the more specified the words like medical terminology is going to be Farsi. religious colloquialisms are going to be arabic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s VERY odd that a container coming from China landed in Vriginia and not in California... Logisticaly it doesn&#39;t add up... I&#39;ve personally only ever dealt with ports in TX, NY and CA. CA ports (again, in my expereince) want to do ever examination possible on every single container that goes through. X-ray, tail gate, and sometimes, even more detailed than that. Doesn&#39;t matter how good your papers look or how long you&#39;ve been bringing the same shit in from the same place they always want to get in there and finger fuck everything. Maybe the port in VA is a little more relaxed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are not &quot;rambling on&quot;, they&#39;re genuinely curious and are throwing around different ideas and tangents to try and get some leads.</p>

<p>Why are the 4 other businesses irrelevant? I must have missed that part, explain if you would. </p>

<p>Here are the 4, with the exact same BL number each time:</p>

<p><a href="http://fonroid.com/canonical.jsp?id=33759053&amp;amp;year=2013&amp;amp;consignee=funcrest-bait-shop">Funcrest Bait Shop</a></p>

<p><a href="http://fonroid.com/canonical.jsp?id=32762087&amp;amp;year=2013&amp;amp;consignee=fundamental-financial-group">Fundamental Financial</a></p>

<p><a href="http://fonroid.com/canonical.jsp?id=27299049&amp;amp;year=2013&amp;amp;consignee=fun-with-phonics">Fun with Phonics</a></p>

<p><a href="http://fonroid.com/canonical.jsp?id=38000261&amp;amp;year=2013&amp;amp;consignee=funland-jumpers">Funland Jumpers</a></p>

<p>Also, there are more elements of conspiracy, which you claim to be &quot;mull and void&quot;, so please explain:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>multiple failed inspections, with minimal penalties, then none after 2011</p></li>
<li><p>name aliases for the parties with government involvement</p></li>
<li><p>all of the initial threats to stop looking into this</p></li>
<li><p>no way to actually register a child here</p></li>
<li><p>the address for one of the above is the EXACT same as a convicted pedophile </p></li>
<li><p>another involved party is an ex-military contractor </p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, until you present sound explanations for all of those, there remains plenty of conspiracy potential.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The &quot;reason&quot; is the various abnormalities of the building, schedule, shipments, and lack of children or activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing wrong with the building. Might be a little outdated and haggard but I have seen trailers used as day cares before. You are not going to get the schedule of the facility unless you have a child there, that is common sense since it prevents pedos from stalking the place. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2u343a/the_slc_day_care_shipping_container_and/co4t2yl">The shipment has nothing to do with the day care check out my post here</a>. There was children activity taken by a redditor. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The &quot;paper trail&quot; reinforces the notion that there is improper documentation and insufficient available information regarding the establishment as a childcare center, not to mention all the odd shipments as noted in the OP.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What kind of paper trail would you like? The day care is obviously a day care cited by the numerous fines they have had over the years (which are quite high but not completely out of the norm). Again, the shipment has nothing to do with the day care at all. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the very least, it would be important to verify that the building is up to code, and that all regulations are met or exceeded as a registered child care center.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meh, no one is really going to give a shit for the most part. This is a day care located in not so great area of SLC. While it may not be 100% or a place you bring your kid they are certified to receive kids through the government services. That would be impossible to do if they were not suitable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s no harm in an audit, given that we&#39;re talking about children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree there is no harm to audit but when you are calling, sending pizzas, taking creepy pictures through the windows, and stalking the place it becomes a concern of safety for the children. You are more likely to be arrested for stalking or whatever than this place to be shut down for being unsuited for children.</p>
