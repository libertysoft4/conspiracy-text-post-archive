    <div class="md"><p>Well, I wouldn&#39;t necessarily say that there is any one <em>physical being</em> or person that rules over the entire planet.  I <em>do</em> feel that there is indeed One Energy that is responsible for All That Is - all that exists, etc - but as far &quot;one being that controls planet Earth&quot;? I think that there are definitely individuals that have absolutely <em>insane</em> amounts of monumental power and influence here...and I&#39;m not sure that any <em>one</em> of those &quot;ultimate ruling beings&quot; is strictly terrestrially-based, but...as far as the beings that are on this planet that are at the top of the food chain here, I think they themselves are likely little more than &quot;underlings&quot; that were put here to &quot;look after the human children on Earth&quot;.  I wouldn&#39;t go as far as to say that there is any <em>one</em> being that is running everything on planet Earth.</p>

<p>As far as I&#39;ve been able to research, it seems that it&#39;s more small groups or factions doing it.  And I&#39;m not talking about small groups like those individuals in the CFR (Council on Foreign Relations) or the Trilateral Commission or <em>those</em> types.  I&#39;m talking about small groups that are FAAAAR more powerful than even them; groups that are so behind the scenes that even the heads of the CFR or CIA might not know much if anything about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See that is the kind of stuff I find fascinating.  You actually belive you had contact with an off world being? Like physical reality or another dimension?  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You actually belive you had contact with an off world being?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  I don&#39;t &quot;believe&quot; I did.  &quot;Belief&quot; is the word that people tend to use if they don&#39;t have any actual data, factual information, or valid, intelligent supposition or evidence indicating a particular thing.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t &quot;believe&quot; I had contact with an off world being.  I understand and acknowledge that what I experienced has very many parallels with what others who have gone on record as having contact experiences themselves also said they experienced also.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like physical reality or another dimension? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, technically, even another dimension is its own physical reality...It&#39;s just vibrating at a different frequency.  Sort of like radio stations.  99.5 isn&#39;t any less real than 102.7.  It&#39;s just vibrating at a different frequency so, depending on which frequency you&#39;re attuned to, you will either experience this &quot;reality&quot;, or that &quot;reality&quot;.</p>

<p>That being said, my experiences involved waking (or semi-waking) consciousness and unconsciousness both.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>was your body transported or your consciousness?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As best as I can tell, although I did experience a conscious, physical sensation (which would imply at least some level of bodily transport), the main feeling I experienced was internal and <em>deeeeply</em> cerebral - like...deeply cerebral to a level and extent that I had never experience before and I&#39;m not super sure I&#39;ve ever experienced since.</p>

<p>Matter of fact, it&#39;s ever so <em>slightly</em> unsettling me even right now thinking about it even though this happened...over 30 years ago.  Perhaps &quot;unsettling&quot; isn&#39;t the word, as I (think I) made my peace with the experiences and feel myself 100 times more enriched and understanding because of it...but yeah...at the time when it was happening...</p>

<p>...the shit was ab.so.lute.ly <em>traumatizing</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for explaining it the way you did. I myself had an out of body experience before. It wasnt off world, it was as if I had exited my physical body and was traveling around.</p>

<p>It was strange because there was a limit on how far I could go. It was real as I physically never moved, but was able to explain what went on outside of where I was in the house. There was no way I could have seen what was going on. </p>

<p>Freaked me out and a few others around. Someone showed me how to do it. We both shared conscience if that makes since. He saw my mind and I saw his. Very strange fellow he was.</p>

<p>This guy was able to control elements like wind and water to an extent. Its hard to explain. He told me there are few thst can control water and those that can are usually mentally fucked up. </p>

<p>He was right in my experiance I have onky met one and she was not right. Some people can see auras for lack of a better term. Sometimes if I concentrate I can see them. This ladies was black. It was unsettling as she was the second that I saw it. The first was a guy that was in jail for raping his 4 year old cousin and then killing her by disembowling her after words.</p>

<p>Anyways i witnessed her moving the water in the bathtub without any visible external forces. Whike she was doing so it was some very disturbing voices all around. They didnt make sence as it was in another language. </p>

<p>Now this was real as I saw and experienced it myself. No one cant tell me otherwise.</p>

<p>Now <em>that</em> sounds awesome.  I can’t say I’ve ever had one of those myself.</p>

<p>Man…I’m pretty envious.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Wow.  Again, absolutely awesome.</p>

<p>Sounds about right.  Man, I would have <em>loved</em> to have been part of that talk.  :)</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yep.  Again, strange things exist in this world and the world beyond.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now this was real as I saw and experienced it myself. No one cant tell me otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only thing I can say is that I wish I was there to have seen and experienced it as well.  I don’t doubt that you did indeed experience these things.</p>

<p>This is part of the reason why, as we have been discussing in the other thread, substance use/abuse is ABSOLUTELY unnecessary.  I mean think about it…there are SO many absolutely real and fantastic things that one can totally experience sober!  And, as a matter of fact, when one is sober, one experiences these things in a MUCH better, much clearer way because you have all your mental focus and clarity to concentrate on the <em>real</em> experience with and you’re mind isn’t clouded by any sort of substance.  I don’t necessarily mean to bring over the topic from one post to another here, but I feel it was very appropriate to mention this here as an example of some of the things I was talking about in the other thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;ve seen enough people in that state and have a direct understanding of the fucked up things they do and how fucked up <em>they themselves</em> are, then you don&#39;t need to try it in order to fully understand that it is <em>not</em> a good thing to do and not a good way to be.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never been shot with a gun before...but I don&#39;t need to have that experience in order to know that it&#39;s not one that I&#39;d like to have.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think your perspective is a <em>great</em> one.  I really do.  I happen to share it to a great extent.  I also happen to feel, however, that I have had enough experience to definitively understand that focused, aware, and <em>sober</em> exertion and intent is the best (if not almost only) way to achieve proper development.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If there was a drug like that shit. Hell yeah I would take it at least once in a comfortable setting. I mean how fucking cool would that be to experiance everything in slow motion. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There isn&#39;t any substance that doesn&#39;t <em>also</em> severely hinder your ability to remain aware and focused in the process, however.  At the end of the day, what is infinitely cooler than taking some substance that alters your brain to such an extent that it causes you to see things in slow motion, is being able to actually BE able to see things in slow motion <em>while sober</em> and focused.</p>

<p>One thing that comes immediately to mind for me as we talk about this ability to &quot;see in slow motion&quot; is the following example:  I&#39;ve boxed for over 23 years.  I&#39;ve done it as a professional, and I&#39;ve been in the ring and in training camps with some of <em>the</em> most amazing fighters that have literally ever lived.  My point in saying this is that over the many years of my doing it, I developed some absolutely amazing skills - so much so that I&#39;ve experienced occasions when I’ve seeing things like Neo from the Matrix does when the bullets were passing by him and he was looking right at them flew by as he was dodging them.</p>

<p>No substances, no chemicals.  What accomplished it was focus, practice, mental and physical exertion, and skills...abilities.  Everything in those moments had the &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; slow motion feeling...except I was 100% sober and focused…not altered by anything…so what I was seeing was pure, real, it was <em>me</em> having that experience...not me with my mind altered by any substance which itself kept me from being able to actually understand what was happening properly.</p>

<p>Again, anything that keeps you from being able to exert your own autonomous, independent will is ultimately detrimental because it causes you to depend on something that is NOT you.  That&#39;s what makes it a crutch and a hindrance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it bad probably. But you cant really judge someone unless you experiance it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve experienced enough to know what it superior to it.  In that sense, I can judge what is indeed better than it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>for most you are so right it is a crutch. Just and excuse to dismiss their responsibility. But others I am not so sure. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t doubt that there might be some that <em>aren&#39;t</em> lazy and using it as a crutch.  However, the overwhelming effect it has on people <em>is</em> SO OFTEN a negative one that it simply does not become worth it to go down that path - since you will more likely than not end up NOT in a good place or in good shape.</p>

<p>Ultimately though…you know what?  I respect that you have the perspective that you do.  Definitely.  I like your point of view, and think that it seems like a good one.  I know my perspective is most definitely not “the only one” around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is my fault for thinking you were completly closed to the idea that its about what is godly right and damned nation wrong. From most of your responses it seemed like you didnt care or even try to think of it from another view.</p>

<p>Now to some they are lazy hell I am in some aspects where if I could take a chemical to experiance something rather then having to focus I would do it most the time. The thing I dont like about most drugs is you are unable to control most the other aspects of motor function or higher thinking. Thats me thou cause I have seen others that can function.</p>

<p>Not saying its right or wrong. Sort of like drinking and driving is wrong but smoking weed to manage pain is up for debate. Its hard to fight the way of change. We will be forced to deal with it as a society. </p>

<p>I am pretty sure weed will be legal within the USA soon and not for the better of society. Its for votes. I mean who votes right now as a majority? Its usually older people and they are dying fast. The newer generation needs motivation so lets give them weed and they will feel responsible to vote for the ones that made it possible. </p>

<p>Thats my take on it. My views are odd sometimes and inwent always like this I used to be set in my ways but thru time I have seen thst fluidity is a better stance for enlightenment in life as well as reddit. </p>

<p>There are so many good people here. I have made friends thru here that interact with digitally as well as on a personal level. It really kind of nice. I have learned a great many things too. Like image to some is so important within their circle. I dont get it. They seem to think they can control another&#39;s actions by the vote system within reddit.</p>

<p>Same as admin thinks another will just go away with a shadow ban.  The views of so many here in this sub is of anger. I dont know why they think they need to or would even want to change things. Like the middle east. Why change their ways? Its been like that forever. Who is any one person or even a group to make it different?</p>

<p>The people that come in this sub to complain and get angry should reevaluate their whole outlook. This sub is for enlightenment and higher understand to issues. A place for discussion. That is what I wish was here. Like this whole convo we have had. We all learned a great deal from each other. I know I have. </p>

<p>Point is shit is gonna be this way and the reason it wont change is because we cant agree on a solution. Its so hard to have a discussion like we have had in here without it becoming a shit fight.</p>

<p>This was very nice and would like to get your views on a few other things. I would like to get others who reads this too. </p>

<p>Yeah.  That’s most people as well.  The problem with that, however, is that one actually DOESN’T experience anything that is “godly” or elevated under those circumstances.  What they experience is just a fucked up reaction in their brain which they can’t even appreciate anyway because they’re FUCKED UP while it’s happening in the first place.  It’s like trying to drive a car after having just downed a six pack.  The vast majority of people THINK they’re okay to drive, but that’s just because their judgment has become screwed up and cloudy and the reality is that they are in about the worst shape imaginable…and if they get behind the wheel, things are going to likely go VEEERY bad for them.</p>

<p>The same thing applies on any other type of substance.  People only <em>think</em> they reach “elevated states”, but they think that in the same manner that someone who is nearly passed out thinks that they’re “okay to drive” and are “driving just fine” if they get behind the wheel even though they are in all actuality doing the most horrible job possible and might end up killing themselves and others.</p>

<p>Again, the only thing that gets one to a <em>real</em> state of elevation is focused, sober, controlled, personal volition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The thing I dont like about most drugs is you are unable to control most the other aspects of motor function or higher thinking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that is the VERY reason why they can never be used to reach levels of higher thought.  They literally don’t LET you get there because it takes away the very thing that you need in order to reach those levels in the first place:  A focused, disciplined, controlled mind. </p>

<p>I am pretty sure weed will be legal within the USA soon and not for the better of society. Its for votes. I mean who votes right now as a majority? Its usually older people and they are dying fast. The newer generation needs motivation so lets give them weed and they will feel responsible to vote for the ones that made it possible. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem with this is that, among the many other negative effects that that substance has on a person, it actually WEAKENS the mind and the focus.  It makes one extremely mentally incapable because it takes away the real <em>fire</em> of focus that is possible without it.  If national legalization of it takes place, I can pretty much guarantee you that it will be for the absolute worse of society.  Things are pretty bad as it stands…but you think we as a citizenry allow ourselves and our rights to get trampled over now?  Imagine how much easier it will be for TPTB to continue taking advantage of the population if a large portion of that population has been rendered slow and greatly lackadaisical because of it.</p>

<p>That is a <em>very</em> good stance to have.  I understand that I likely seem pretty rigid in my stance against substance abuse.  I guess ultimately I kind of feel that anybody can do whatever they want to do.  It’s up to them.  I just feel that for myself personally, I wouldn’t do certain things.  That’s all.</p>

<p>Wow.  Man…that is an <em>amazingly</em> rockin’ perspective!  Really.  I’ve come across some pretty cool conversations here (like this one definitely)…but I’ve also come across a LOT of bad ones. lol.  I also know that I myself can come across as a jerk, so I wouldn’t doubt that I make people aggressive sometimes in just the way I respond to things.  That’s one thing I’ve noticed about Reddit:  It has shown me that I myself can be a bit of a jerk too.  I mean I’ve always KNOWN that…but some of the conversations I’ve gotten on here have put the mirror up to my face and have caused me to take a look at myself and say “Yeah, man…You can be a bit of an unnecessary asshole sometimes.”  That’s caused me to try to be a bit more…mindful about what I say and how I say it…Cuz I don’t WANT to be a jerk or come across as one if it’s not necessary or called for, you know?</p>

<p>It does - and no substance can provide it.  Again, nothing but a crutch.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the case with most (if not all).</p>

<p>You will likely hear from someone who perhaps <em>thinks</em> they got &quot;enlightened&quot;, but anything that actually alters and changes your ability to think and focus clearly and distinctly is ultimately undermining, self-defeating, and detrimental to the advancement of one&#39;s developing perspective.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The thing is that it somewhat makes a bit of sence for the first time to become enlightened, but why continue to do drugs afterwords? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it&#39;s, again, a crutch for the weak, and abusers get confused into thinking that 1) the state they&#39;re in after using is an &quot;enlightened&quot; one when, in fact, and as you correctly noted, it is anything <em>but</em>, and 2) since using tends to engender a deep, deep sense of weakness and dependence, it tricks the user into thinking that the detrimental state that occurs after using is actually the &quot;enlightened&quot; state.  It&#39;s actually the <em>opposite</em> of the enlightened state.</p>

<p>I tend to stay away from any and every mind/perspective-altering external substance.

<p>I often equate the two, as once one understands how generally detrimental and undermining substance use actually is, using <em>is</em> ultimately little more than abusing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its important to hear their own rationale for a choice isnt it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  I&#39;m glad you said this, and this is very balanced on your part.  That being noted, it would seem that the reason people become involved has to do either with curiosity - in which case it would still fall under &quot;abuse&quot; since the end result will still involve the detriment of the user - or it involves an individual who has a trauma in their lives that is so deep that they resort to substance abuse in order &quot;kill the pain&quot;, etc...in which case, then it&#39;s DEFINITELY abusing.</p>

<p>Either way - casual use or hard use - it seems like abusing to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>sometimes others need drugs like prescriptions. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certainly.  That&#39;s why I made sure and made the distinction when I mentioned substances which are &quot;mind/perspective-altering&quot;.  Somebody taking a Tylenol for a headache, for example, doesn&#39;t really qualify.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is that an exception?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Somebody going under general anesthesia for a surgical procedure seems to be an obvious exception.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Say like medical marijuana? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has been my distinct experience that many that use this substance <em>very</em> easily begin to cross over and begin to use other substances that <em>are</em> indeed legitimately illegal, and often a downward spiral is the result.  It&#39;s like somebody just watching a &quot;little bit&quot; of porn.  Once one starts, it&#39;s generally not easy to stop and very easy to &quot;binge&quot; so to speak to an even more detrimental extent.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He then explained alcoholism and how that was to always be chasing that feeling. It wasnt nessacary for that thou. He said it was because you dont need to have that feeling all the time.

<p>On many levels, it certainly seems that way, unfortunately.  This seems all the more reason to be careful and be very disciplined with oneself so that one doesn’t fall into those excesses.</p>

<p>Ha.  It’s actually <em>really</em> funny that you mention that because I have to admit that I’ve actually found it very interesting that I myself say that as often as I do.

<p>When people say things like &quot;drugs are ________&quot; I just stop listening and here&#39;s why: Drugs are not remotely one category, and any discussion of drugs has to include every intoxicant, meaning alcohol, cigarettes, and prescription meds, among others.  He who has never had a beer has credibility, but also no frame of reference.  Many drugs are used as a crutch, as someone here pointed out.  None more than alcohol.  But to lump psychedelic experiences which are typically spaced out over months or years into the same group as alcohol or heroin used on an hourly or daily basis is pure ignorance.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Society has tought us there are good and bad drugs. Its wrong I agree. Thou many over use the &quot;bad&quot; ones and become a burden. </p>

<p>I smoke cigs. I do it cause I like the feeling. I dont want to quit either. I am sure if I did then I would. I quit meth cold turkey so I am pretty sure cigs wouldnt be a problem. </p>

<p>Now for you I ask you have an ooen mind and not shut people down so quickly. Listen to what they say and offer some points to justify your claim.  It works hell it is with me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Repectfully, I don&#39;t think a re-read of this thread reveals me to be closed minded or to have shut anyone down.  Rather, I expressed my opinion and kept the doors open to the person who asked a question (you, &quot;why would you need drugs&quot;), and I chose not to engage with the person who clearly has a viewpoint he or she wishes to impose on those around them (crutch commenter).  Now, I admit that I momentarily lumped you together, and I may have been a little facetious, but I don&#39;t think I came in the ballpark of shutting anyone down. </p>

<p>Now that I&#39;m reminded of your question I will give a crack at a brief answer.  It&#39;s not just the barriers that we&#39;ve acquired through agents of socialization, but also biological barriers that are broken down.  As we plod through life human beings develop a framework that allows us to make sense of things.  It&#39;s a lattice consisting of everything from knowing the sound of a potentially dangerous speeding car without looking to what we believe about abortion.  If we truly hope to change that structure when new information--truths not formerly revealed--come along that maybe should be closer to the foundation, it is nearly impossible to simply assimilate that into our existing framework.  The neural pathways are already established with the un- or half-truths that were the best fit at the time.  Psychedelics can be a useful tool in unwinding the untruths by allowing you to enter a sort of child mind which is unencumbered by our accumulated bullshit.  From there it becomes much easier to rebuild our personal paradigm using our newly acquired truth in the foundation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religion?  Dont take me the wrong way, but I have never subscribed to the religious aspect of anything. Weather it what lord gave us or took away. To me the bible seems as if was written for control. </p>

<p>The rules of the bible and teachings are normal (majority of population) common sence. That could be because of the bible too and its influence thru the ages. </p>

<p>I like to think man has control over all aspects and teachings. Its something we can see and belive as it has evidence. The entire oh you need faith dont work for me. I have faith man will come out as the victor, and will do so because it was his own actions.</p>

<p>I travel a lot for work. I see most the USA and know what I see in poverty stricken areas the most? Churches. God everywhere and I see nothing being changed. People going twice a week and not making progress for the community. Its sad to see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Untold truths? Ha it was nothing like that. I have a questioning demeanor on my own. I really enjoy history and it started in 6th grade when we learned of pearl harbor. </p>

<p>It made no sence to me the events leading up to the attack. Why would we tie ships together like that? Why that day? So I started to research more and more. It was then I learned the word conspiracy and what it ment. </p>

<p>Some of the untold truth is that we will never know the truth its for the most part speculation until the government confirms it. Then when they do its mostly redacted to never really be clear.</p>

<p>Now I know some shit has to stay secret. Thats fine for national security. The thing is thou is people think the war was about oil, and I dont for a second. Thats just me and my tin foil hat shining as others say. I am fine with the stereotype until it becomes the moment when another is just saying it to start an argument. </p>

<p>You see most people on reddit dont want a discussion they want you to confirm their own theory.  Thats not gonna happen most the time. You have to be open to new ideas and while some make sence many others dont. </p>

<p>See you have to ask yourself things like why do we know more about the surface of the moon then the depths of our oceans? Why have a race to the moon? What was so damn important that we had to get there first? </p>

<p>Everything the leaders of nations do like this is to galvanize the population and boost moral for something else.  To me its that way. Now I could be wrong, but I think that if you got people behind you for something like that they will follow you into any situation. </p>
