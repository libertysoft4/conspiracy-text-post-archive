<p>What&#39;s the best method of turning the United States into a communist country?</p>

<p>This 99% vs the 1% is a ruse to infect the minds of the people with communism. They&#39;ve gamed and abused the system purposefully in order to break us down, collapse us, and engage us with a desire to take from some for the benefit of all.</p>

<p>All of this is by design. They have us angry about exactly what they want us to be angry about.</p>

<p>Environmental Protection</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The constitution actuslly contains directions for this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Constitution contains a number of sections that are relevant to the environment.</p>

<p>The environmental right - Section 24</p>

<p>Everyone has the right to:</p>

<p>an environment which is not harmful to their health or well-being
have the environment protected for the benefit of present and future generations through reasonable legislative and other measures that prevent pollution and ecological degradation, promote conservation, and secure ecologically sustainable development and use of natural resources, while promoting justifiable economic and social development.</p>

<p>Section 24 therefore places a duty on all spheres of government to take reasonable steps, including to make laws, prevent pollution, promote conservation and ensure sustainable development.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for banking regulations, the constitution only allows congress the power of the purse, and does not allow congress to pass along this power (according to a strict interpretation of the constitution). This argument is essentialy centered around what is considered &quot;necessary and proper&quot; in regards to the federal reserve act. </p>

<p>So, any new laws would be concerning the federal reserve, which is not a government agency or bureau. I believe in more banking regulations, but not for the federal reserve. I believe the federal reserve act must first be abolished before we go down this road. </p>

<p>Must we abandon our constitution and our founding ideals contained therein?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. And, the constitution was designed to be flexible with a changing populace and the changing times. This is why we have constitutional amendments. However, it is simply not done appropriately, as those in charge get frustrated in how difficult it is to chsnge the constitution (which was by design, mind you). </p>

<p>In addition, for all the topics not covered by the constitution, we are allowed state constitutions, and local legislation, to cover for these holes. The design was meant so that if you didnt like the laws in one psrt of the union, you could always move to another part thst suites your interests better. </p>

<p>But, again, those in power wanted to chsnge certsin things in the constitution. Knowing that it was going to be incredibly difficult for them, they instead enacted unconstitutional laws to do whst they wanted. The War on Drugs and the pursuant legislation (The Controlled Substances Act) is a perfect example of this. Nowhere in the constitution does it grant the federal government the authority to ban any chemicals. Yet, they have done just that, when it is actually up to the states and the local governments to decide things of this nature. This is the point im getting at.</p>

<p>If we want chsnge, we should do it right. By using the excuse thst the constitution is just not applicable today, we are being lazy and disingenuous. We can make it applicable. Thats what it was designed for. It can be flexible, but to chsnge it, we must do it as prescribed, lest we set up &quot;legal&quot; precedence for usurpations of unvetted authorities to pave the road for tyranny. </p>

<p>It would be silly to think that those who knew most about tyranny and about fighting against tyranny would be ignorant in their legislations concerning just those topics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said to stop the cycle we must stop taking from others. Which seems fair.</p>

<p>However, &quot;the damage has been dealt.&quot; The wealth of the People has been siphoned for years, reallocating it to the most wealthy individuals. I was implying that if we, as a People, were to try to adopt this &quot;no taking from others&quot; mentality, we would run into major issues because many folks would then think &quot;well they took all this from us, we need to get it back so thst its fair. Then nobody takes from others after that&quot;.</p>

<p>Did that clear it up?</p>

<p>Environmental Protection</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The constitution actuslly contains directions for this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Constitution contains a number of sections that are relevant to the environment.</p>

<p>The environmental right - Section 24</p>

<p>Everyone has the right to:</p>

<p>an environment which is not harmful to their health or well-being
have the environment protected for the benefit of present and future generations through reasonable legislative and other measures that prevent pollution and ecological degradation, promote conservation, and secure ecologically sustainable development and use of natural resources, while promoting justifiable economic and social development.</p>

<p>Section 24 therefore places a duty on all spheres of government to take reasonable steps, including to make laws, prevent pollution, promote conservation and ensure sustainable development.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for banking regulations, the constitution only allows congress the power of the purse, and does not allow congress to pass along this power (according to a strict interpretation of the constitution). This argument is essentialy centered around what is considered &quot;necessary and proper&quot; in regards to the federal reserve act. </p>

<p>So, any new laws would be concerning the federal reserve, which is not a government agency or bureau. I believe in more banking regulations, but not for the federal reserve. I believe the federal reserve act must first be abolished before we go down this road. </p>

<p>Must we abandon our constitution and our founding ideals contained therein?</p>
