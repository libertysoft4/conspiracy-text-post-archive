<p>is the new internet paradigm. Since one law of web say that people attention span is very short and they get annoyed even faster, just create them some little annoyances like this and they will move on from the &quot;dangerous&quot; video to something that doesn&#39;t represent a problem to the system.</p>

<p>edit: just trying to watch this video :) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZECDaTJOTtk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZECDaTJOTtk</a> it doesn&#39;t work even on 144p</p>

<p>but this one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bP1f_1o-zo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bP1f_1o-zo</a> :D HA play nice at 1080p HD</p>

<p>that damn trailer works like a charm in crazy quality, Corbett face is loading and loading at 144p for the past half hour (even closed the tab and opened the video numerous times, still the same problem): <a href="http://i.imgur.com/MRJfwS7.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/MRJfwS7.jpg</a></p>

<p>edit 2: the above links may work fine for you, this is done at user level. they don&#39;t block a video globally. this is not about the two videos above off course.</p>

<p>Because I feel like I&#39;m being trolled.</p>

<p>You&#39;re comparing a video with 5 000 views to a video with 9 000 000 views.</p>

<p>YouTube is built on a cloud storage solution. This means that a video might be uploaded to a server in one country, and then distributed to servers in other countries gradually, depending on demand (historical and projected).</p>

<p>So the first video you linked is not popular, and especially may not be popular in your region. Thus you are either stuck streaming it from a low-priority foreign server, or only a few low-res versions have been distributed to your nearby nodes.</p>

<p>The second video is popular, likely watched by people from around the world. But it&#39;s also uploaded by a channel account with over a million subscribers and which routinely gets millions of views on its videos, which means that YouTube will prioritize it for global distribution so that they can meet the projected demand for the video.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I disagree. I think you&#39;re watching videos of low popularity and narrow distribution and perceive a conspiracy when there is nothing more malicious than a cloud distribution algorithm at work.*</p>

<p>Feel free to provide evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>*  The reason you are getting poor performance is that you are streaming a video from a server far a way, and YouTube considers it low priority compared to people who are watching more popular content, thus your loading time gets horrendously long, and packets lost means that you will experience stuttering in video and audio. You can get almost the same effect by trying to watch a video from a popular channel minutes after it uploads. Call it a conspiracy if you wish, but YouTube doesn&#39;t have infinite storage or infinite bandwidth, and the internet is not infinitely efficient, so compromises have to be made to get as good a service as possible for as many users as possible, and sometimes that does not include you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it doesn&#39;t work like this. This is made at user level, so your experience with the same video will not be the same as mine. This to avoid the obvious danger in having people pointing fingers at a blatant censorship of one video.</p>

<p>Imagine one video getting globally blocked. One can post a link and say &quot;Hey they blocked that! Censorship! Censorship!&quot;</p>

<p>So is more subtle.</p>

<p>Is easy to check if you know to analyze what are the meaning of the videos and which one can be a danger to the system. You can recognize this and try again and again to see that particular video till it works. You can insist because you want to see the content you are not trying to be &quot;wake up&quot; by that video.</p>

<p>Is very effective to people that happen to pass by that particular content that have no clue about the argument. They will say &quot;Fuck it! it doesn&#39;t work&quot; and move to another video. Danger of &quot;waking up&quot; avoided.</p>

There&#39;s probably a cognitive bias for this(!). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, for one the Corbrett video is plus 40 minutes, and the American Sniper vid is 03:00. So Corbrett will take longer because of of its file size. They both played fine for me with the exception of loading time. </p>

<p>Although, I have experienced and felt the same as you about youtube, so not sure what to make of it. The conspirator in me says it&#39;s Youtube, but what the hell do I know :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right - because if YouTube is indeed giving some videos or <em>types</em> of videos preference (effectively discriminating against others), it is an INTERNAL decision of how they handle the data on their own servers.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re right - it&#39;s NOT a &quot;net neutrality&quot; thing - but it offers a taste of what the Net will look like if net neutrality is abandoned.</p>
