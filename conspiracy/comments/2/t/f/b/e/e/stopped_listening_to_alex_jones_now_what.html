    <div class="md"><p>Great advice right here.</p>

<p>Although, I will argue that to your last point, occasionally jumping out of your comfort zone and testing your analytic skills in an area you know little about as a mental exercise.</p>

<p>Once you surprise yourself with your new found abilities, you&#39;re gonna wanna start connecting what I call <em>meta dots</em>, and trying to find a sort of <em>Conspiracy of Everything</em>, like the theoretical physicists are trying to merge relativity and quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>And fuck, man, is it entertaining. It&#39;s a drug, and I can&#39;t stop. Every day it&#39;s something new, some new event, some propaganda, some geopolitical chess move you saw happening before it happened because <strong>you&#39;re fucking awake, man</strong>, and you realize that this shit is out there and people by design don&#39;t see it. You didn&#39;t for the majority of your life.</p>

<p>At the risk of sounding superbly cliche, you unplugged yourself from The Matrix without taking a pill. Maybe you had some help, but <em>it was you that did it</em>, and at some point you&#39;re going to start wondering why <em>you did it</em>, and others <em>haven&#39;t</em>. </p>

<p>Yep.</p>

<p>I&#39;m there.</p>

<p>Even discounting the completely implausible that so often litters this sub, yeah, it&#39;s there.</p>

<p>I never stopped asking questions, and never was satisfied with implausible, irrational answers based not at all on evidence.</p>

<p>Those who haven&#39;t, do not possess or have had beaten out of them (far more likely) that level of curiosity.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s that simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try Michael Rivero, he does a daily show. I personally never bothered listened to Alex Jones, he&#39;s the CNN of conspiracy basically and his ranting provides no value. I haven&#39;t listened to Michael Rivero for long myself but I was brought on to him by this video:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24AMP_bttd8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24AMP_bttd8</a>
and from there I started listening to him and I think he has a lot of relevent stuff to say and his opinions are basically on point most of the time but alas as with ANYONE there are parts of the person that does sit and parts that don&#39;t but overall he&#39;s one of the good ones most definitely.</p>

<p>That&#39;s funny. Alex Jones &quot;banished&quot; Rivero many years back for disagreeing with Jones. I don&#39;t remember the details, but it was very telling how Jones didn&#39;t want Rivero&#39;s opinion heard.</p>

<p>So... Good pick for someone finally catching on that Alex Jones is a turd.</p>

<p>Thank you!  </p>

<p>Confirmed Alex Jewnz didn&#39;t like Rivero telling the ugly truth about Zionist-Jews. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A little more info from Mike ...</p>

<p>WRH: &quot;I have not made a big deal about the reasons for the move, but in a nutshell, GCN is a reflection of Alex Jones&#39; views of the world, and <strong>more and more our points of view regarding Israel are diverging</strong>. I get a lot of email asking why I do not challenge Alex on his defense of Israel, or asking why <strong>every time I am on his show Alex feels obligated to have a pro-Israel representative on immediately afterwards to counter the points that I made.</strong> </p>

<p>I view the attack by Israel on a US flagged ship and Americans in international waters as an act of war and all who defend said attack as traitors to the USA. Alex holds a different view and I guess the breaking point was his rant in which he said that <strong>anyone who is a critic of Israel is a &quot;weak-minded fool&quot;</strong>. That made it a personal attack, and I decided it was time to step out of Alex&#39;s shadow and go in a different direction.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t necessarily stop checking all of Alex Jones&#39;s news, I check out his site once in a while. The thing with all news in general is that you take it with a grain of salt and develop your own opinion. But yes Alex Jones is really negative and he gets me way to pissed off at what the fuck is happening, so I definitely stopped listening to him. There are some shows on RT that are very good like Breaking the Set. I do also like NPR, its not really conspiracy news but it is very intellectual and gets you thinking. But to me right now since there is sooo much news all the time, its sooo hard to find out the actually truth about what is happening, and I really don&#39;t think there is a AWESOME alternative news program that is 100% truthful. Hopefully one day though we will know the truth and we will all live happily ever after. HA! :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like Michael Savage, except for one blind spot he has -- he&#39;s a fanatical pro-Zionist who won&#39;t say a single critical word about Israel. It&#39;s not just that Savage avoids criticizing Israel the way Alex Jones avoids it -- Savage won&#39;t even acknowledge that there is anything wrong with Israel. To hear him tell it, Israel has done nothing wrong throughout its entire history, and for some reason the evil Arabs keep picking on it because they are anti-Semitic.</p>

<p>Apart from his insanity on Israel, Savage has some clarity about major topics such as global warming, Obama, immigration, and so on. He&#39;s a waspish, sour, embittered old Jew, but he&#39;s entertaining.</p>
