    <div class="md"><p>At first i was captivated and convince. Upon further investigation, i realized some claims were a little, &quot;forced.&quot; So i decided to do my own.</p>

<p>I am now of the position that there must have been older civilizations on earth. I do not doubt this at all. But the alien aspect of it, i now question. </p>

<p>Just as plausible, or maybe even more plausible, is that humans have been around for so long, that we have achieved a higher understanding of the universe way back when, more so than we do now. This makes fewer assumptions, imo, and explains everything that claims of aliens would. Thus, i put more belief into this line. </p>

<p>But i still do not discredit alien visitation in ancient times, mind you. I jist feel thst a terrestrial species, maybe not human, makes more sense than an extraterrestrial species. </p>

<p>As for cover-ups, do a little diggin with the scientists called egyptologists. They are arrogsntly secretive, and dont &quot;share&quot; their pyramids. For instance, not too long ago there was a shaft found in the great pyramid, so the resesrch team built a robot to go check it out. At the end of the shaft was a door, a small door, with metal dustings on the &quot;floor&quot; of the shaft. After testing, they <em>know</em> there is a chamber on the other side. But the egyptologists closed thst section down before further investigstion could be found, and for several weeks no one was allowed to go into that area of the pyramid. We still dont know if anything was found.</p>

<p>I definately believe in cover ups of ancieng civilization, be it of alien origins or human origins. For some reason mainstream archaeologists do not want to admit thst civilization is much older than they cirrently believe. </p>

<p>Another egyptian example: there has been a lot of erosion testing done on the sphynx. The erosion that is prevalent on it heavily suggests a precipital type of erosion, i.e. rain.</p>

<p>Not sandblasting as the egyptologists clsim. This puts its construction at least back to the last time it had a climate thst produced enough precipitation conducive to such erosion. Thst was at the end of the last ice age, about ten thousand yrs ago. But, egyptologists claim that thir ancestors, the ancient egyptians, built it so it is impossibke to have been built during that time (a few thousand yrs earlier than the firsg ancient egyptian dynasties.) Since they are the only entity that claims authority on these monuments, the mainstream archaeologists go with it, despite the evidence.</p>

<p>Call it pride, call it control, call it whatever you want. They dont wsnt the world to know how old humans have been building civilizations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well he argues hyperdiffusionism, and uses evidence such as how we find pyramids throughout the world, but ignores that we can trace the development of each culture&#39;s pyramids to find that they were developed independently of each other.

    <div class="md"><p>Im not too sure about that, honestly. Particularily in ancient times. </p>

<p>But even today, i fear putting my faith in anthropogenic climate change. Mainly because the current arguments tend to omit the role of water vapor, which takes 95% responsibility for earths greenhouse effect. </p>

<p>0.28% of the total greenhouse effect can be said to be contributed by humans. Three quarters of which is carbon dioxide. So we are talking about 0.21% of total greenhouse effect gases that our governments say is about to tip us over the edge?</p>

<p>Why target something so seemingly frivolous as CO2 and omit the massive 95% contribution of water vapor? And why, then, set up carbon credits and exchanges thst then lead to billions of dollars of profit for those who own and regulate the exchsnges? Because we are warming the earth? By contributing 0.28%? </p>

<p>Maybe. Maybe 0.28% is enough. But they better find some good evidence to prove this. The charts they often show thst illustrate the rise in global tempersture vs human industrial activities seem to suggest such a thing, but correlation does not mean causation. Scientifically, they must come up with much more evidence before going full willy with their conclusions and the pursuant legislations and regulations, imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice. Discount the points i have suggested and return with the usual argument. </p>

<p>Again, i am still on the fence. I have yet to see one of these thousands of peer reviewed studies that take into acciunt natural and preexisting water vapor. Instead, they conveniently leave that part out, and focus on the 0.28% of global greenhouse gases that humans are supposedly accountable for. </p>

<p>Again, i am on the fence, as i have yet to find out exactly how CO2 contributes so massively despite its much lower presence. Maybe a small amount of CO2 causes certsin cycles to produce more water vapor? I do not know, as i have not looked deep enough, yet, to figure it out. </p>

<p>I speak from a perspective of 2013, the last time i researched this topic. A brief google search came up with a study from miami.edu that said in july of last year (2014) scientists claim they have proven CO2 has had a direct impact on water vapor. But, i struggle to find a verifiable source thst explains <strong><em>how</em></strong>. </p>

<p>So, please, read my posts closely. I never said they were wrong. I only said they need to come up with concrete evidence that suggests beyond a doubt that human made CO2 directly affects our climate, and in doing so, they must address the issue with water vapor and the cooperative actions of both to really be able to convincingly conclude anthropogenic climate change. </p>

<p>Until they do, and have it confirmed by independent scientific peers who are not on the same payroll, i will not be 100% convinced. To add, the suspiciousness of jumping the gun on highly suggestive and seemingly convincing yet innately speculative claims to pass legislation and regulstions thst make for profits for a small group of people (who also, coincidentally, have much influence on these &quot;thousands of peer reviewed studies&quot;). Its suspicious all around. It would be foolish to imbibe this nectar without truely knowing whats in it. </p>

<p>With that said, and my admitting of ignorance, do you, sir, have any sources thst dirdctly explains the relationship between CO2 and increased water vapor that does not depend on correlation/causation fallacies?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>AGW is a pretty obvious scam.  The first and most glaring clue should&#39;ve been in all of the obviously fraudulent and outright false claims that &quot;97% of scientists agree&quot;.  And then there&#39;s the fact that the terminology has gone from &quot;global warming&quot; to &quot;climate change&quot;, why is that?  Could it be because none of the global warming predictions have come true for two decades and the climate is and has always been changing, thus making this unfalsifiable?</p>

<p>And none of this is even acknowledging the most obvious fact that the Sun is, has been, and always will be <strong>by far</strong> the most significant factor when it comes to global temperatures.</p>

<p>After a bit of searching, that does not seem to be what happened. </p>

<ul>
<li>The shafts in the Queen&#39;s Chamber were explored in 1992 by the German engineer Rudolf Gantenbrink using a crawler robot he designed, Upuaut 2. After a climb of 65 m (213 ft), he discovered that one of the shafts was blocked by limestone &quot;doors&quot; with two eroded copper &quot;handles&quot;. Some years later the National Geographic Society created a similar robot which drilled a small hole in the southern door, only to find another door behind it. The northern passage, which was difficult to navigate because of twists and turns, was also found to be blocked by a door. Research continued in 2011 with the Djedi Project. Realizing the problem was that the National Geographic Society&#39;s camera was only able to see straight ahead of it, they instead used a fiber-optic &quot;micro snake camera&quot; that could see around corners. With this they were able to penetrate the first door of the southern shaft through the hole drilled in 2002, and view all the sides of the small chamber behind it. They discovered hieroglyphs written in red paint. They were also able to scrutinize the inside of the two copper &quot;handles&quot; embedded in the door, and they now believe them to be for decorative purposes. They also found the reverse side of the &quot;door&quot; to be finished and polished, which suggests that it was not put there just to block the shaft from debris, but rather for a more specific reason.</li>

<p>Well first of all, not all Egyptologists are Egyptian. Secondly, we actually have a decent amount of evidence that would imply it was built at around the same time of the pyramids (and no, the pyramids were not built 12,000 years ago, despite what Graham Hancock may claim).</p>

<p>But that&#39;s the thing. There is no evidence of many of these ancient alien claims. Most of them rely on artefacts taken out of context (such as the &quot;Palenque astronaut&quot;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Curious, how much do you know about the controversial character known as Dr. Zahi Hawass? And how much are you aware of his contradicting reports? And about his dictatorial stranglehold on all information that is allowed to come out to the public, as well as whether or not certain findings are allowed to be presented to the public?</p>

<p>There are egyptologists who heavily dislike Hawass for the way he keeps the lid shut tight. There are many reports about scandals involving Hawass as well as the SCA. What is &quot;accepted&quot; as fact concerning the giza plateau is merely what Hawass and the SCA allow to be accepted. Egyptologists have been prosecuted for reporting their findings directly to the public rather than through the authorities which are set up to literally decide what info gets out, and how it gets out. </p>

<p>That halocasty thing, this is the first ive heard of it, so i cant comment on it just yet. Ill have to do some researching on it, but to be honest, at face value, i do not understand how crystalizing degradation of rocks can be mistaken for precipital erosion. There would certsinly be differences, and geologists certainly would be able to tell the difference. Again, ill look into this first before reaching a conclusion.</p>

<p>As for that report about the chamber, when the researchers found that door, the egyptologist that took hawasss position during a brief period where he was removed (like i said, there were scandals), said there was nothing behind it. After a few yrs, in 1996 when Hawass was reinststed, Hawass said it was an interesting find, and they will investigate it and report their findings in september of thst year. It wasnt until september of 2002 (the televised show on nat geo) when they reported that they found another door down the shaft passed thst first door, and thst they will, again, investigste and report their findings soon.</p>

<p>As far as i know, we havent heard of anything since then. </p>

<p>For the rest of the world, we have found monuments built with precision thousands of yesrs before we thought we had civilization. Gobekli Tepe is one example. I feel thst it is foolish to believe thst civilization began in sumer, when we have structures, massive structures, thst were built thousands of years prior. How do we expect hunter gatherers to organize and build these awesome structures? With conventional wisdom and copper chisels, it woukdve taken a long time to do, much longer. This means that the people who built it must have set up shop near the sites, as a nomadic people would have taken much much longer to build these pyramids than what is allowed by currently accepted construction dates. </p>

<p>There must have been very ancient civilizations, imo. And it doesnt take too long for all traces to be wiped out by nsture. Have you ever seen the show called &quot;life after people&quot;? Ten thousand years is more thsn enough time to completrly rid thd earth of all traces of our current civikization, with the exception of massive stone structures and underground facikities. Im talking about cars, wires, skyscrapers, etc. </p>

<p>Add in a mammoth flood, and you can see why i dont take absence of evidence as evidence of absence, as it concerns ancient civilizations.</p>

<p>I understand your position about the aliens, i do. Thsts a tough one, as, like you said, things are taken out of context or highly speculative in nature. Hence my esrlier comment that it coukdve been humans or some other terrestrial species. </p>

<p>Oh, and all this without even considering the ancient texts. If there are billions of people who believe in the abrahamic texts, why is it so farfetched to believe in the predescessor texts of Sumer, which contain the earliest know stories of the very same context believed by so many people? And then consider the rotten cortuption organized religion has influenced through erasure of history and ancient cultures, which, all things considered, altogether suggest a very long, and a very perserverent effort to conceal actual human history in favor of a predetermind storyline condusive to a more pliable populace...</p>

<p>Aliens or no aliens, i dont really care just yet. Although im fascinated with the idea of ancient aliens, i am more concerned with prehistoric human civilization.</p>

<p>Well not really actually. Like I said, we have a lot of information that is clearly visible to anyone visiting the plateau, that all but proves the date for the construction of the pyramids was not 12,000 years ago, but actually around the accepted time period. This also makes sense when you account for the evolution of pyramids in Egypt, and the fact that we have direct records about who built the pyramids and why.</p>

<p>As for that report about the chamber, when the researchers found that door, the egyptologist that took hawasss position during a brief period where he was removed (like i said, there were scandals), said there was nothing behind it. After a few yrs, in 1996 when Hawass was reinststed, Hawass said it was an interesting find, and they will investigate it and report their findings in september of thst year. It wasnt until september of 2002 (the televised show on nat geo) when they reported that they found another door down the shaft passed thst first door, and thst they will, again, investigste and report their findings soon. As far as i know, we havent heard of anything since then.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably because it&#39;s not very easy to drill past all that to get the robot through. And no, they very quickly released the results (in this case that there was a door blocking the shaft). As for the 1996 expedition, that was solely done by National Geographic, and they released the information when they put out the documentary. That&#39;s not very surprising. There really is not anywhere near the amount of suppression as you seem to think.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the rest of the world, we have found monuments built with precision thousands of yesrs before we thought we had civilization. Gobekli Tepe is <del>one</del> <em>the only</em> example.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FTFY. That&#39;s on of the main issues with the super-ancient civilization theory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do we expect hunter gatherers to organize and build these awesome structures?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No offence, but you&#39;re essentially saying that prehistoric civilizations were not advanced enough to build anything like this, which does not seem to be the case. As for how they organized, the most likely reasons are either religion or their leader. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>With conventional wisdom and copper chisels, it woukdve taken a long time to do, much longer. This means that the people who built it must have set up shop near the sites, as a nomadic people would have taken much much longer to build these pyramids than what is allowed by currently accepted construction dates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gobekli Tepe is not a pyramid. And as for the construction of Gobekli Tepe, it is without a doubt quite interesting, but far from impossible, especially if they felt there was an important reason to construct it (i.e. religious purposes). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ten thousand years is more thsn enough time to completrly rid thd earth of all traces of our current civikization, with the exception of massive stone structures and underground facikities. Im talking about cars, wires, skyscrapers, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually no, just due to plastics alone degrading extremely slowly. And not only this, but you&#39;ve proved my point that we&#39;d still have most of our massive structures, which aside from Gobekli Tepe, is not something we&#39;ve found as of yet from that time period. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There must have been very ancient civilizations, imo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But we do not have evidence of said civilization, and I might add that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Add in a mammoth flood, and you can see why i dont take absence of evidence as evidence of absence, as it concerns ancient civilizations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But like I said, not only would the flood not be anywhere near enough to destroy a civilization, but even if it did, we&#39;d still expect to find evidence of this culture, especially considering people like Hancock claim that they are responsible for all the other civilizations afterwards (which is easily disproven).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh, and all this without even considering the ancient texts. If there are billions of people who believe in the abrahamic texts, why is it so farfetched to believe in the predescessor texts of Sumer, which contain the earliest know stories of the very same context believed by so many people?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the Sumerians did not exist 12,000 years ago. And as for similarities with the abrahamaic religions, that doesn&#39;t particularly surprise me, since they originated in the same general area. You see similar things when comparing mesoamerican religions (i.e. the Maya and Aztec have fairly similar religions and religious practices, although they are not identical)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And then consider the rotten cortuption organized religion has influenced through erasure of history and ancient cultures, which, all things considered, altogether suggest a very long, and a very perserverent effort to conceal actual human history in favor of a predetermind storyline condusive to a more pliable populace...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This still does not really prove an ancient civilization, it just proves religion is a very powerful tool.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aliens or no aliens, i dont really care just yet. Although im fascinated with the idea of ancient aliens, i am more concerned with prehistoric human civilization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s certainly a fun topic to think about, but we do not really have any evidence of it, which is why among most historians and archaeologists, it&#39;s not accepted.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It seems that the exact date is somewhere around 1572, which would actually coincide with the end of the conquests.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There were alot of ppl in that city, it wasn&#39;t some castle on the hill, and you know that. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, it&#39;s pretty small. The maximum population was around 750-1000 people, which fits in decently with the average size of the emperors court. Not only this, but assuming this is the way it was used, then you can account for the extra space being due to there having been the higher classes there, and as such they would warrant such space.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An achievement designed to be able to withstand seige, or else, why make it so self sustaining.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well by definition anything built there no matter how defended would be able to withstand a siege. The Incas had a habit of building at an altitude. As for the self-sustaining part, that&#39;s actually one of the most impressive feats of Inca engineering, their use of terraces along mountainsides, which was their main source of food.</p>

<p>I get the feeling you might be confusing it with the Antikythera Mechanism. But either way, I&#39;d be interested to know what you find.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because Darwin forged evidence to fit his theory, and there&#39;s alot of it. Start with Haeckel, and that lil rabbit hole leads to a point to prove Darwin was the beginning of what was wrong with science. He set out to prove his theories, not test them. </p>

<p>It&#39;s adaptation that Darwin dresses in the guise of evolution. If we define adaptation as a creature&#39;s transformation to better suit the enviroment in which it inhabits. Where as evolution suggests that a whole new creature is formed, distinctly diffrent (though perhaps still sharing some) charactrists. </p>

<p>We can trace the development of pyramids in all of these areas, and see that they all happened independently or each other, this makes sense when you consider that for massive structures in ancient times, a pyramid is the easiest structure to produce.</p>

<p>Maybe we have a different definition of &quot;free&quot; in regards to this.

<p>I get the position of the strict definition of &quot;free,&quot; as everything must be ptovided maitenance, and maintenance requires invested man-work-hours, which certainly isnt free. But like i said, with the right applications, i would define &quot;free energy&quot; as one which the only cost is for the labor involved in building and maintaining the infrastructure thereof, unlike oil where we must pay for the infrastructure construction, maintainence, as well as research (investigsting other oil fields for future use) as well as paying for the actual process of extraction and then refinement. </p>

<p>Yes, and the flood hypothesis is essentially impossible. In fact, I had a long argument with another user about the flood hypothesis. I can see the end of the ice age being the possible origin of the flood myth, but the actual change in sea level was nowhere near enough to wipe an entire civilization out of existence, and nowhere near biblical proportions (as that would actually require more water than exists on the entire earth in any form).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well wireless transmission isn&#39;t really energy generation (and it also tends to be pretty inefficient compared to non-wireless methods). That&#39;s why we often use it for smaller things like phone chargers. As for the ionosphere thing, we still have yet to prove such a thing is even possible, not to mention in his later years, tesla made some pretty outlandish claims (such as his earthquake machine or death ray).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And with the right development and application, i consider piezoelectricity to be &quot;free&quot; energy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except that you&#39;d need a ridiculous amount of whatever your source is, since it accumulates very little if any charge, not to mention it still requires energy to be added, thereby making it not free.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hell, hydroelectric energy csn be considered &quot;free,&quot; if it wasnt made into a lucrative business due to competition with Big Oil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is about the closest we&#39;ll likely ever get to free energy, and despite this, it is still nowhere near free. It&#39;s cheap (hence why places like Quebec that generate most of their electricity through hydroelectric power have such low electricity costs), but we&#39;ll never find an energy source that is actually free since those tend to involve perpetual motion, which is not physically possible.</p>

<p>There are many theories that describe the deluge. I dont buy the melting ice cals, either.

But, a large enough object slamming into just two or three places (the theory claimed seven, which is plausibke, but i dont think its very likely at all) would cast enough water onto the shores to really devastate the human populations. Not to mention the pursuant climate change as a result (which, per this theory, ended the last ice age). </p>

<p>They have some pretty cool things to think about with this theory. For instance, there are sea horses in lake titicaca. But even more interesting to me is (alledgedly) salt lake in utah has a salinity 8 times (IIRC) greater thsn sea wster, and if you fill in the volume of its basin until it overflows, youll have to add 8 times more water to it. Essentislly, if you took all the water out of salt lake and replaced the entire thing with sea water and then let it evaporste over millenia, youll get the same salinity. </p>

<p>I wish i can sound out many other examples, however circumstsntial they may be, butbi just csnt from memory at the moment. The great deluge is one of my favorites...</p>

<p>No, since they function quite differently. His was claimed to work through &quot;teleforce&quot;, and was able to, and I quote:</p>

<ul>
<li>send concentrated beams of particles through the free air, of such tremendous energy that they will bring down a fleet of 10,000 enemy airplanes at a distance of 200 miles from a defending nation&#39;s border and will cause armies to drop dead in their tracks.</li>
</ul>

<p>So not that similar to the ADS.</p>

<p>But again we run into the problem of there not being any evidence of this civilization remaining, and also the side issue of us not finding evidence of this impact, which we should find considering how big it would have to be to produce waves of such a scale.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not to mention the pursuant climate change as a result (which, per this theory, ended the last ice age).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well the actual reason for the end of the ice age is that our climate cycles between hot and cold over millions of years. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The more likely explanation for both of these is probably plate tectonics, since the shape of the continents has changed over time, so it&#39;s entirely possible there was a species of seahorse that was separated, and evolved into a separate species over time.</p>

<p>It&#39;s cool to imagine, but we really don&#39;t have any evidence for it.</p>

<p>You may look at rocks and see minerals, sediment and glacial movement. But can you feel the stone <em>and listen</em>?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. While I don&#39;t think it&#39;s impossible that there are aliens from other planets, I think their visitation, if it occurred, probably went unnoticed. Considering the incredibly life-supporting nature of earth, its millions of years of unrecorded history, and near certainty that advanced civilizations have come and gone from its surface, I would say that everything we find on earth is of earthly origin, but not necessarily human. It&#39;s less of a stretch to imagine that even other species; e.g., dinosaurs, evolved sufficient intelligence for civilization and intelligence.</p>

<p>Considering the ancient monolithic monuments must have coexisted with an extensive and advanced global civilization at the time, yet all evidence for its existence besides that carved from giant stones cannot be found, it&#39;s not that much of a stretch to consider that <em>anything</em> could have existed here and we&#39;d be none the wiser.</p>

<p>What if the evidence was an 8 foot tall lizard person that in plain english said, &quot;Hi, I come from Draco, and we&#39;ve been ruling you for millinia&quot;</p>

<p>Without knowing what the evidence being withheld is, there is no way to know for certain that the evidence in which we are provided, truely does disprove aliens.</p>

<p>Personally, i don&#39;t believe in aliens from other planets coming and visiting us. But, to suggest that it&#39;s impossible? I can&#39;t see any reasoning for that. </p>

<p>My bad, I din&#39;t see that. And you still have not really responded to my point. I&#39;m not trying to argue about 9/11 (since that inevitably becomes a shitstorm), but I&#39;m saying that the 3 buildings, 2 planes argument doesn&#39;t really make sense, since it implies building 7 was untouched by the first two impacts, which is absolutely not the case.</p>

<p>I&#39;m waiting for any form of proof whatsoever. I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re advocating believing things without thinking critically about them, on the sub that claims to be all about critical thinking.</p>

<p>We have far more than enough information freely available, you just need to know what to look for. This is especially true with scientific or archaeological theories on this sub, that we often have direct evidence against. For example: the moon landing conspiracy, flood hypothesis, geocentrism, flat earth (or skycentrism since there was that user here that posted only about how the earth was apparently a bowl), etc...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I sometimes wonder if all of that was actually destroyed or if that was just the convenient cover story to prevent future people from looking for it.  Cortez, for example, was working for the Spanish/European aristocracy, is it sensible that he would burn and destroy potentially invaluable ancient texts without keeping any sort of record of them?  Would those funding his expeditions have <em>wanted</em> him to do that?  Stretches plausibility to me, although of course it&#39;s possible.</p>

<p>But I am 100% sure that we would find some very interesting things in the Vatican library...</p>
