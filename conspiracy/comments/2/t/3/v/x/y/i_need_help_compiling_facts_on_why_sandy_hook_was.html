<p>Best of luck.  People really do not want to talk about it in my experience.</p>

<p>These two clips point out that there was def green screens being used...to me anyway.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxTafqejV6k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxTafqejV6k</a></p>

<p>and all the deaths or disappearances around it.</p>

<p>Finally, Dooms videos are fantastic.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ProfessorDoom1/videos">https://www.youtube.com/user/ProfessorDoom1/videos</a></p>

<p>Seems it was a DHS excersize, no kids were killed(that&#39;s how they are getting away with it, if you ask me)
and the corporate media doesn&#39;t give a shit about the people.</p>

<p>Icing on the cake?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to sound like a shilly goose here, but your green screen clips boil down to an object you don&#39;t know what it is (therefore green screen?) and a guy visibly shifting his weight (note the changes in the surface of his jeans).</p>

<p>You may unintentionally be spreading disinformation in the form of not only false claims, but false claims which wouldn&#39;t mean much even if they were true.</p>

<p>It only serves to muddy the water and pretty much turned me off from following the rest of your links, assuming they were of the same quality.</p>

<ul>
<li>what&#39;s the purpose of the use of a green screen? </li>
<li>why capture the people going through the scene and claim there a green screen camera there? absurd. Shows that the guy has no technical understanding of what he is even alleging.<br/></li>
<li>were they going to reuse the corridore and have the people walk through it again later? It makes no sense. </li>
<li>is he says that&#39;s the projector? They walk in front of it.<br/></li>

<p>Pretty much EVERY piece of sandy hook shit I have seen is as ludicrously flawed as this. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why I say, this is right wing blowhard fantasy self diddling... NOT skepticism, NOT intelligent, NOT thoughtful. it&#39;s a ludicrous embarrassment to the real see thinking. it&#39;s for right wings suckers to be afraid Obammy is going to take their cap guns away...</p>

Some ppl that are here, arn&#39;t from around here, if that makes sense, and they try to make things appear as they arent. to keep you from asking questions, and then maybe seeing some shocking evidence. you&#39;ll notice that video had no lead in, no music, just what was aired on t.v. for you to digest. =)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remeber when this all happened. My first thought? Unimaginable grief. Believe it or not, just because I subscribe to r/conspiracy I don&#39;t just assume everything is a conspiracy just after it happens.</p>

<p>I wait for the facts to come out, then the questions, then I start to make decisions about the event.</p>

<p>And that was when I saw that video. Jaw hit the floor. </p>

<p>I showed it to a coworker of mine. Not a conspiracy theorist at all. Not really even an informed voter. Had a child about the age of the children at Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>I think she just watched it to humor her likeable conspiracy theorist coworker/friend. She even said, &quot; Well, in situations like that you never really know how a parent will react. They can do all kinds of weird stuff&quot;.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t look once at the video as I showed it to her. Just studied her facial expressions. They went from &quot;putting up with this politely&quot; to &quot;what the fucking fuck did I just see&quot; just like that.</p>

<p>Based on the fact we had worked and sat next to each other for over a year at this point, and that she always rolled her eyes at my &quot;conspiracy&quot; shit...She was a little fucked up after seeing that.</p>

But how you read into the guy praticing his lines on top of that last vid i posted. i mean, idk what happened that day, but there&#39;s no way something bullshit happened because look at all this strange bullshit. Did the illuminati kill Robin Williams. I doubt it. But who knows? Was Sandy Hook just a school shooting. Fuck no, no way. Way too evidence to point that something other than the offical story told happened. Idk wht it was. idk who was involved. but there is a stank of fishy all over the incidents of that day.</p>

<p>laughing out of remorse for his daughter that was shot hours ago by a crazed gun man</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never said that. I said that just because he lost a loved one doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s disbarred from laughter for an arbitrary period of time. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>because that&#39;s certainly more plausiable</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Compared to what? Him being one of dozens (if not hundreds) of paid actors working in tandem with one another in a false flag perpetrated by the government? If that&#39;s your alternative proposal, then yes. It is objectively a more likely scenario.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it is what that master nbc told ya, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I get my news from many sources, and none of them are TV. So no, NBC didn&#39;t tell me. Nice straw man, though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you accuse me of jumping to conclusions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I literally haven&#39;t even made a conclusion. I am simply trying to show you that the one you seem to have jumped to is asinine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, just so you know, u/ct_warlock is a serial <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> troll and discourages everyone here from thinking outside mainstream narratives.  I have the user tagged and if you look into its account history you will witness an abnormal amount of naysaying, sarcasm, and mean spirited arguments.<br/>
That being said, your family probably CAN see what you see, they just don&#39;t want to (yet).  Its your job to make them want to.  Don&#39;t go on the offensive.  You won&#39;t convince your family by jumping up and down and being loud.  Get well versed in Sandy Hook or whatever event it is you&#39;re questioning.  Be able to assert beyond pure speculation. Wait for your moment, wait until someone else brings it up, and use one or two bits of evidence you find most convincing in disproving the official narrative and drive them home, in a calm, cool manner as if it isn&#39;t even a big deal to you.  I think if you pull this off, your family will be more inspired than they are now to look into it for themselves.  I&#39;m pretty sure anyone who seriously looks into these events from an objective standpoint without using exclusively mainstream sources will come away more awake to the truth.  Remember, the key is to not freak out when you&#39;re giving your opinion, not get offended when they retaliate (for you will have offended them by speaking the truth), and to know what you&#39;re talking about.  Also, once you&#39;ve planted the seed, don&#39;t drown it.  Take advantage of when they prompt you with questions, but in general, Its way cooler and easier to be sure of ONE thing than argue over a lot of things you might not know as well.  Don&#39;t let anyone strawman you, stay on topic!  Finally, remember that with all these events, we don&#39;t actually know what really happened, don&#39;t offer explanation, only present evidence proving the official narrative to be absurd, because it almost always is.</p>
