        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, as it appears, a post about crisis actors has caused a domino effect in terms of shadowbanning, and shills posting &quot;be careful what you up vote&quot; threads. </p>

<p>I, for one, do not believe ANY subject &quot;makes this subreddit look bad&quot; and I do not believe users of any subreddit are trying to impress anyone, so I say continue posting on any subject that you feel. In fact, I&#39;d like the sub to get a little weirder (but that&#39;s just my preference)</p>

<p>What&#39;s so dangerous about the subject? Let&#39;s see some links. </p>

<p>First, I searched &quot;crisis actors&quot; and the top result is: </p>

<p><a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Crisis_actor">http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Crisis_actor</a></p>

<p>Which explains that crisis actors are a real thing, that play parts in emergency drills, and there is companies that supply them, but only conspiracy theorists think that crisis actors could be involved in well known national tragedies. </p>

<p>Upon switching over to the &quot;Images&quot; tab of the search, this is the first image that comes up:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--WOCmGciQ--/bfao5yjo8ythypzsdhmm.jpg">http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--WOCmGciQ--/bfao5yjo8ythypzsdhmm.jpg</a></p>

<p>Now I must admit, to me those both appear to be the exact same woman, but they are clearly listed and interviewed as two different people. Is that an example of a crisis actor? </p>

<p>So, now I go over to YouTube and search &quot;crisis actors&quot; and this is the first video that comes up: </p>

<p><a href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pDMzbmxISIA">http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pDMzbmxISIA</a></p>

<p>Which seems to be a bit convincing, but not nearly as convincing as the previous image. </p>

<p>So what do you have to share, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the crisis actor angle is extremely vulnerable to subjective interpretation. The human mind is trained to find familiar and repeating patterns. But much like conflicting eyewitness testimony regarding the same event, human memory is not accurate. </p>

<p>The two women do look similar but the clincher is different chins. I find it hard to believe whatever witness protection scheme The Powers That Be use for crisis actors would only alter a person&#39;s chin and little else. </p>

<p>On a personal note, I was once shown a picture of what could only be my doppelganger. A bank manager swore that I resembled her son in law. My jaw dropped upon seeing the picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Response to shekels question about femoral artery severing:</p>

<p>Both of his femoral arteries have been opened. Exposed. You don&#39;t live long in this state. </p>

<p>Competent Medics can usually save guys sustaining these injuries in places like Iraq because they are attached to the unit. -They are on the spot immediately (&lt;1 min).  </p>

<p>They run up and CLAMP two things: Your femoral arteries.   You get about a 5 minute window to do this.   That window exists because your body shunts (keeps away) blood from your extremity&#39;s when it gets into a shock situation. </p>

<p>Carlos Arredondo was/is an FBI &#39;actor&#39; btw (The guy pushing the wheelchair). -His son died in the marines, in response/grief he ended up destroying a US govt car by dousing it in gas. He was arrested, the FBI came to his hospital room and offered the deal despite the fact Carlos Arredondo was living in the USA illegally at the time and instead of jail/fine/deport, he did what they said.. and was paid for it. </p>

<p>Watch the video of him mulling around waiting for his signal.. Look how long he ignored the victims.. This was all staged (badly). </p>

<p>This is public information. There was an arrest, it made the news. Carlos Arredondos facts change in significant manners in multiple interviews. He wears fabricated credentials. His back story is a fabrication and he was a known member of &#39;La Raja&#39; (Mexican fringe organization). </p>

<p>Our government is running false flags in order to enact legislation which ultimately reduces our ability to correct the situation. Ask yourself why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I am saying is that it is medically possible for someone with a double amputation to be conscious and have minimal bleeding. I have never experienced someone with blast injuries so I can&#39;t personally say if this man&#39;s injuries are consistent with typical blast injury. However I can say that this image is not the smoking gun it seems to be. </p>

<p>I found a <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=e0a_1350318870">liveleak video</a> (NSFW) of two people with double amputations from a gas cylinder blast (not the exact same thing) with injuries that look consistent with the man in the photo. I don&#39;t know if they are conscious but from the video it looks like it is possible they haven&#39;t lost 2 liters of blood which is generally when you will pass out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An amputation has a lot to do with amputation. I admitted I don&#39;t know how amputations from blasts present but neither do you. Without evidence either way it is entirely reason to be skeptical of the claim it was fake. What is a similar solution, a blast amputation doesn&#39;t bleed much (just like many other amputations), or the entire thing was staged? </p>

<p>If you can find evidence either way I would love to hear it. All of the NIH studies on blast amputations are behind paywalls. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Potentially, yes, but we can&#39;t tell. Remember that &quot;clean&quot; in this context has nothing to do with dirt. It has to do with how the artery and surrounding tissue was severed.</p>

<p>The blast was strong enough to crack his femur like a twig. Understand that you and your 3 best friends aren&#39;t strong enough to break a femur. If I handed you a sword and told you to chop off a guy&#39;s leg, you might nick the blade, but you wouldn&#39;t go through unless it was a blade sharpened by a physics lab.</p>

<p>What his leg underwent was ... massive and sudden shearing stress. This can remove tissue almost surgically, and does so so fast that, yes, it can be a very clean cut.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also from personal experience (being on the other end) I can say that if concussion is involved (probably is with a blast) shock is instantaneous, and the normal rules of conscious vs. unconscious go out the window. It doesn&#39;t mean he was lucid, but his eyes being open and his body erect in the chair... entirely believable.</p>

<p>Also, the site claims that he had no tourniquet, which is clearly wrong (you can see the white cloth tied off around his leg) but as you say, either the blast crimped off his FA or he&#39;s lost enough blood that he should be dead (also doesn&#39;t mean he can&#39;t look conscious).</p>

<p>Edit: Aha! Found another photo angle (google his name plus boston bomb leg victim) where you can definitely see the bandaging over the stump which appears to be pulled up in the picture, here, probably from getting him in the chair, and an EMS worker running along side him. Given that, I suspect that EMS guy probably either applied an adhesive (comes from military techniques... it&#39;s basically superglue, and is routinely used by EMS now) and/or a heat source (e.g. flare). That might also explain some of the color in his skin. It might be ... ugh ... medium rare.</p>

<p>Seriously, how much confirmation bias do you have to engage to take what you see that tells a narrative that matches the facts and turn it into &quot;these are professional actors who were engaged by the same people who engaged foreign teenagers as reliable-under-stress actors&quot;?! I live 3 blocks from the bombers (well, did) and had to listen to them detonating their trashbags  and kitchen items while my city was locked down. I know people who volunteer to help the burn survivors emotionally and physically. This wasn&#39;t some stage play. This was my damned city! ... sorry, it&#39;s hard not to get carried away by the emotion, but the lack of empathy of that article has me mad as hell!</p>

<p>The last I visited was a few years ago where there was clear information about who they were, what they did etc.</p>

<p>Now the website is down with no explanation and most news reports I see say &quot;crisis actors&quot; like they no longer exist.</p>

<p>Here is an archive of the site: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130102013048/http://crisisactors.org/">https://web.archive.org/web/20130102013048/http://crisisactors.org/</a></p>

<p>Was this site a hoax? Does anyone know what&#39;s up here?</p>

<p>No. Facial reconstructive surgery isn&#39;t something that takes an hour and is good to go perfectly healed the very next day.</p>

<p>Maybe using temporary prosthetics, but you can tell that&#39;s not the case here, these are two different women.</p>

<p>There are a lot of people with &quot;clones&quot; out there. I have a &quot;clone&quot; of myself in my town, saw this dude skating down the main street by my house wearing literally the exact shorts and venom t-shirt I wear and his face looked just like mine, even his skin tone, everything, it&#39;s just uncanny, I really need to meet this dude so I can get a picture with him to show everybody.</p>

Like takes two minutes and the face looks different enough to pass as a different though similar looking person, barring scrutiny.

    <div class="md"><p>Her hair style is used to shape her face as well. You can see, the darker woman gives her eyes some spacing. Israel parts her hair in the center and lets her bangs hug her eyes. This makes her head look more oval shaped. </p>

<p>The noses, the nostrils seem compliant in the very least. She could have easily used makeup to change the look of the bridge on her nose. Both ladies are caked in makeup ao I wouldn&#39;t doubt it. Check out <a href="/r/makeupaddiction">/r/makeupaddiction</a>, these ladies basically perform cgi in real life.</p>

<p>And about their teeth, it&#39;s hard to come to any real conclusions because one lady always smiles and the other does not. Also, these ladies are doing different things at different angles. You can tell the darker lady has thick gums between her front two teeth. But Israel never shows her top gums. They both have unique gaps in their teeth but it would be country productive to dismiss the entire subject over mis matching k9s because they are looking into the camera at different angles. Think of a flat boarded fence. You look at it head on and you see nothing. You look at it at an angle and you can see through to the other side. </p>

<p>It&#39;s very hard to make a conclusion based on the videos alone. I&#39;d love to hear their voices too.</p>

<p>Care to expand on that? I&#39;ve made at least one post calling out some clear BS this sub has been upvoting late. It was basically a meta discussion about the health of the sub. Does that make me a &quot;shill&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Response to shekels question about femoral artery severing:</p>

<p>Both of his femoral arteries have been opened. Exposed. You don&#39;t live long in this state. </p>

<p>Competent Medics can usually save guys sustaining these injuries in places like Iraq because they are attached to the unit. -They are on the spot immediately (&lt;1 min).  </p>

<p>They run up and CLAMP two things: Your femoral arteries.   You get about a 5 minute window to do this.   That window exists because your body shunts (keeps away) blood from your extremity&#39;s when it gets into a shock situation. </p>

<p>Carlos Arredondo was/is an FBI &#39;actor&#39; btw (The guy pushing the wheelchair). -His son died in the marines, in response/grief he ended up destroying a US govt car by dousing it in gas. He was arrested, the FBI came to his hospital room and offered the deal despite the fact Carlos Arredondo was living in the USA illegally at the time and instead of jail/fine/deport, he did what they said.. and was paid for it. </p>

<p>Watch the video of him mulling around waiting for his signal.. Look how long he ignored the victims.. This was all staged (badly). </p>

<p>This is public information. There was an arrest, it made the news. Carlos Arredondos facts change in significant manners in multiple interviews. He wears fabricated credentials. His back story is a fabrication and he was a known member of &#39;La Raja&#39; (Mexican fringe organization). </p>

<p>Our government is running false flags in order to enact legislation which ultimately reduces our ability to correct the situation. Ask yourself why.</p>
