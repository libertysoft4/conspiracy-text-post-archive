        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> This patent has nothing to do with <strong>&quot;HF RADAR&quot;</strong> my apologies for the misinformation.</p>

<p>Four days after the missing flight MH370 a patent is approved by the Patent Office...Here is your motive for the missing Beijing plane.</p>

<p>As all 4 Chinese members of the Patent were
passengers on the missing plane.</p>

<p>4 of the 5 Patent holders are Chinese employees of Freescale Semiconductor of Austin TX.</p>

<p>Patent is divided up on 20% increments to 5 holders.
Peidong Wang, Suzhou, China, (20%)
Zhijun Chen, Suzhou, China, (20%)
Zhihong Cheng, Suzhou, China, (20%)
Li Ying, Suzhou, China, (20%)
Freescale Semiconductor (20%)</p>

<p>If a patent holder dies, then the remaining holders
equally share the dividends of the deceased if not
disputed in a will.</p>

<p>If 4 of the 5 dies, then the remaining 1 Patent holder
gets 100% of the wealth of the patent.</p>

<p>That remaining live Patent holder is Freescale Semiconductor.
Who owns Freescale Semiconductor ?? Jacob Rothschild through Blackstone who owns Freescale.</p>

<p>Here is your motive for the missing Beijing plane.
As all 4 Chinese members of the Patent were
passengers on the missing plane.</p>

<p>Patent holders can alter the proceeds legally by
passing wealth to their heirs. However, they cannot
do so until the Patent is approved. So when the plane
went missing, the patent had not been approved.</p>

<p>Thus, Rothschild gets 100% of Patent once Patent
holders declared deceased&quot;</p>

<p>Actually, you are wrong.</p>

<p>If a patent holder dies, his right to patent revenue is inherited by his estate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why take down an entire plane? Do you realize how difficult that would be? It&#39;d be much much much easier to cause an accident on the road to airport or send someone into their homes to put bullets on their heads.

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. The Rothschilds have so much money it has taken on the form of absolute power. They can literally have anything done within the realm of physical possibility. I absolutely believe taking down this plane could be done at the snap of the fingers for Rothschild...they pay 50 or 100 Million $$ to hire the dark agents to rig the plane...they get billions from now owning 100% of the patent.</p>

<p>No plane-no evidence. All I can say right now is Fucking WOW. What a bomb.</p>

<p>9/11 taught us a lot about remote access to the planes controls. Some reports have the plane climbing to 40,000 feet (remotely lose the cabin pressure, everyone passes out,dies?) report then says plane descends rapidly to 20,000 ft.(under remote control?)  then it seems nobody knows what next....I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m just throwing shit against the wall and seeing what sticks at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah i actually looked into his name after (which was a pretty stupid thing to do as I should have done before) <em>but</em> i find that the conspiracy theorists really have a hard on for the rothschilds based on really old myths and legends that they actually control the world, when in fact there is no proof of any of the rothschilds being behind any of the conspiracies that certain nut jobs like to connect them to.</p>

<p>I honestly came here expecting to find some intelligent people conversating on actual verified evidence and looking at some possible theories, what i actually found is the same nonsense i see all over the internet about the Rothschild&#39;s controlling the world and the same &quot;American government is the enemy&quot; bullshit. I will still come back looking for actual verified facts and such as i know all is not as it seems and a lot of the time there are alterior motives</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And you keep reading conspiracy websites till your so paranoid that you havent left the house in years and you&#39;ve disconnected your internet because the NSA is watching you. You guys want the truth as long as that truth is that the government is actually behind it and being controlled by &quot;the evil elite&quot;. If you really wanted the truth you wouldn&#39;t take some freelance journalist crackpots word that the rothschilds are behind it to start world war 3, you would actually be verifying that information for yourself and actually see how stupid it sounds. </p>

<p>I have an open mind to everything and am sceptical about what the media gives us, <em>but</em> instead of saying &quot;yeah the evil elite rothschilds are behind this and everything else&quot; i research both sides and make that call myself. I dont just pick a side and then blindly believe whatever that sides opinion is. Do yourself a favour and look at some sceptics websites on conspiracies and then seperate fact from fiction and form your own opinion</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I absolutely agree that getting caught up in the fear of it all is debilitating and renders you counter productive. Honestly, this is the majority of those in the conspiracy movement. Their confusion overpowers action. But in their confusion they view it as lucidity. However, one can only be responsible for himself, so it should not matter your action based on the inaction of others.</p>

<p>Jacob Rothschild through Blackstone who owns Freescale</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What, precisely, does <em>Jacob Rothschild through Blackstone</em> mean?</p>

<p>Jacob Rothschild is a member of the <a href="http://www.blackstone.com/the-firm/overview/our-people/jacob-rothschild">International Advisory Board of the Blackstone Group</a>.</p>

<p>Blackstone is a publicly listed company, and as such is &quot;owned&quot; by anyone who holds shares in it, predominantly large funds controlled by finance firms.</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jacob Rothschild does not own Blackstone. He&#39;s not even a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BX:US/profile">key executive</a>.</li>
<li>Saying that Blackstone owns Freescale is only <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/16/business/16freescale.html">partially true</a> (they&#39;re part of a consortium which pooled together to perform the buy-out).</li>
<li>Saying that the patent goes to Jacob Rothschild is not true (such patents are typically owned by the corporation, not the individuals who came up with it).</li>
</ul>

<p>Blackstone has done some <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/11/wall-street-buying-foreclosed-homes">shitty things</a> that we should be all be aware of, but this isn&#39;t one of them.</p>

<p>The name Rothschild is just like a red rag to a bull with the conspiracy community, and people seem ready to draw extremely tenuous links to suit their conclusion, when on this occasion it just isn&#39;t the case.</p>

<p>Who owns Freescale Semiconductor ??</p>

<p>Seeing as it is a publicly traded company, that would be the stockholders. A company only has an &#39;owner&#39; if it is privately held.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well their stock is about to take a beating on the downside.. </p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> for clarification, their stock did move up a little bit today, but otherwise it was pretty choppy (+20 cent gain compared -2.10 dip it has taken over the past week), the overall picture shows a move down with this move up being consolidation, possible monday, tuesday it will continue to consolidate, then we&#39;ll see another move down.. </p>

<p>However the flip side, looking at a Daily chart, the move down could have been the consolidation and this move up is the start of something much larger, however I have my doubts. </p>

<p><strong>edit2</strong> upon closer inspection look for $21.10, $20.30, $19.49 as targets on the downside.. If it blows past these number start looking for $16.58 in there.. </p>

    <div class="md"><h2>This is bullshit! Here is from my friend Shawn, who is a patent examiner:</h2>

<p>I am sick and tired reading this nonsense about patent conspiracy re Jacob Rotschild, Freescale, and 4 Chinese inventors who were on the Malaysian flight 370. It was published in many online sites last month and now this nonsense started circulating over email. Here are some real facts (I am surprised that press didn&#39;t check them before publishing their &quot;sensational&quot; stories). 1. Any western company requires their employees to assign ALL rights fro their inventions/patents to the company name. All that employees get is a bonus payment when the patent is granted (issued by US patent office). The payment is typically between $1K and $3K depending on the company. Freescale Semiconductor is no exception, all patents filed by its employees belong to the company. 2. The ONLY US patent recently issued by these 4 Chinese employees mentioned in the press is US Patent #8,671,381 (&quot;System for optimizing number of dies produced on a wafer&quot;), which is about minor improvement in manufacturing process. ALL rights to this patent were assigned Freescale Semiconductor. You can easily check these facts yourself by doing patent search on patft.uspto.gov</p>

<p>Therefore, the whole conspiracy theory falls apart: Freescale Semiconductor lost 4 employees and didn&#39;t gain anything from this loss. They already had all rights to this (minor) patent even before it was filed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve linked the patent you guys want to be looking at below. It is from March 11th with the 4 names OP listed.</p>

<p>Also worth checking out is a radio interview with Captain Field McConnell, former army pilot who was forced to retire early from Delta after relaying sensitive info about illegal modifications (namely, uninterruptible auto-pilot) to Boeing jets to the FBI, FAA, Northwest Airlines and NoRAD. He&#39;s the one that suggested a lot of what OP relayed. It seems like he&#39;s suggesting a &quot;rogue nation&quot; was behind this, with Freescale-Rothschild interests at heart. Carlyle Group is the other Freescale buyer, and we don&#39;t need to get into the shady political control they&#39;ve been able to acquire over the years. Interestingly, Freescale&#39;s stock is up 4% this week after Analyst Upgrade...</p>
