        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Various reports have labeled the activities of the CIA against; and the dispute with, the Senate Intelligence Committee as a major Constitutional Crisis.</p>

<p>After all the CIA is supposed to be overseen by Congress via the Intelligence Committee, not the other way around.</p>

<p>Obama, The CIA, And The Limits Of Conciliation
<a href="http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/obama-cia-john-brennan-031414">http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/obama-cia-john-brennan-031414</a>? </p>

<p>Calls for Brennan’s Ouster Emerge Along With Details of CIA Search of Senate Computers 
<a href="http://interc.pt/1cz6O0W">http://interc.pt/1cz6O0W</a></p>

<p>But none of the reports in the media get to the heart of the matter, nor do they ask any searching questions.</p>

<p>John Brennan works for Obama and Obama is supposed to be able to fire him at the drop of a hat, just like anybody else who works for Obama.</p>

<p>Did the CIA Chief Just Dare Obama to Fire Him?
<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/11/did-the-cia-chief-just-dare-obama-to-fire-him.html">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/11/did-the-cia-chief-just-dare-obama-to-fire-him.html</a></p>

<p>So why hasn&#39;t Obama fired Brennan and instead stayed silent on the matter?  The dispute is not going away anytime soon.</p>

<p>N.B. Brennan gave a speech to the CFR on March 11th. Presumably Brennan used this opportunity to get backup and support from the CFR, in his dispute with the Senate.</p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t Obama fire James Clapper and Keith Alexander for their blatant lies to Congress - a Federal crime?</p>

<p>Why would Obama want to approve someone who has proved to be incompetent and is a known supporter of torture from the Bush regime, for CIA Director in John Brennan?</p>

<p>Brennan was canned for nomination in 2009 because of these reasons. Nothing has changed between 2009 and 2013, in regards to John Brennan.  </p>

<p>The questions that should of been asked of John Brennan at his confirmation hearings - but weren&#39;t

<p>What has John Brennan got on Obama? </p>

<p>How did a one term, supposedly very left wing, Senator ever get to be President? </p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t the CIA stop him by using their assets in the media to spread some stories to discredit him and prevent him from getting the Democrat nomination? </p>

<p>After all, Obama&#39;s only credible rival was the strongly establishment and pro CIA, Hillary Clinton. </p>

<p>Why has Obama refused to prosecute senior bankers for their massive frauds before, during and after the house price crash and instead bailed the big banks out with trillions of dollars?</p>

<p>Why is Obama pushing through blatantly Corporatist &quot;trade&quot; deals in TPP and Tafta, which have very little to do with free trade and everything to do with boosting the profits of large Corporations at the expense of National Sovereignty?</p>

<p>Obama has been on the side of the CIA, the NSA and the bankers; and against the Constitution, the Rule of Law and the American people from the get go. There is a very good reason for that.   </p>

<p>An inconvenient truth for Barack Obama - He is a Corporatist NOT a Democrat

<p>The torture report will be buried, if Republicans take control of the Senate in 2014.
