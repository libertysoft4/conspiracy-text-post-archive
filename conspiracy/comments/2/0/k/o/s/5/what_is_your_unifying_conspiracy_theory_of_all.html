    <div class="md"><p>the funny thing is though is that this is not a conspiracy theory, this is a theory of how the world works and social/group dynamics.  The people you describe are the people that strive to be in control and have the intelligence to take it, each individually or in small groups chaotically.  we give names to the loose coalitions of these individuals (the illuminati, etc.) but that is for convenience more than anything, as it doesnt matter if they are functioning as a cohesive unit or not, they are just as dangerous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of the extent to which the masters of this civilization have succeeded at convincing a great number of us that there is no such thing as the survival of personal identity upon the expiration of the physical vehicle, there has throughout the course of time immemorial been such an overwhelming amount of evidence and studies definitively showing the very thing that remaining stuck under the impression that all we are is a physical mass of meat and bones is a genuinely untenable stance.  Although there are many other types of examples, out of body experiences themselves (OBEs) are sufficient to prove that identity is not limited to the physical vehicle alone, and quite a number of studies and institutes have been founded establishing the phenomenon as a very real, verifiable occurrence.</p>

<p>We live in a society, however, that - as I implied initially in this response here - is controlled by forces with a <em>very</em> vested interested in convincing the majority of the human population that this little, tiny, limited, physical life...is all you get - all you have - and when it&#39;s over? that&#39;s it.  Nothing more.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a lot easier to control a society when they think that their entire identity is limited to the little thing they see in front of the mirror every day and that they are taught to be so very attached to.</p>

<p>I never said it was. There&#39;s a big difference between being interested in something and taking the time to look into and being told there is OVERWHELMING evidence of something and asking to see it.</p>

<p>If this evidence was so overwhelming I think he&#39;d be linking us to it and not saying it&#39;s out there. I&#39;m not asking him to do research for me, I&#39;m asking him to back up his fucking assertions.</p>

<p>For me to answer this definitively would involve my personally KNOWING &quot;exactly what happens after the expiration of the physical vehicle&quot; and, like almost every human on Earth, I am generally as blind and limited as the next person when it comes to direct, personal experience (in this life) of that area.  However, and again, there have been a sufficient amount of valid examples and people who <em>have</em> peered behind the curtain of this physical life - not the least of which is Dr. Eben Alexander, a neurosurgeon who had an NDE (Near Death Experience) and was able to recall his experience while supposedly &quot;dead&quot; - to give any real critical examiner a very good indication that this physical life is <em>not</em> by any means all there is to existence, perception, or personal identity.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I could in fact give you my personal estimation of what I feel will happen, but I will limit my commentary to what I have mentioned above here so as to not type <em>too</em> much.  Cheers,</p>

They can recognize each other at a young age, and form covert networks often in the form of cults or secret societies where they collude on agendas. They condition secondary psychopathy into much of the population. This has been occurring, and they power has been consolidated, over millenia.</p>

<p>They enjoy manipulation for the sake of manipulation, and causing pain for the sake of causing pain. They view the average emotional human with amusement and disgust. They want to create a system where through fear and suffering the emotional human willingly enslaves himself to a system that benefits only the psychopathic elite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually agree, from a mythological/allegorical angle. The metaphor of Adam and Eve represents the fall of man, which can ultimately describe the beginning of evil, which in my opinion, means the beginning of a fear based human. The early seeds of awareness of ones own parts that need to be covered. Many things, IMO, that appear conspiratorial by the classic definition, are (I think) still a conspiracy but not in the way people think. Maybe it appears, from a removed vantage point, to be this group of puppeteers holding the marionette strings. Maybe we are puppets and there are strings, and maybe so many at the very top are controlling it all, however, maybe the aren&#39;t consciously aware of the role they play. What may appear to be an organized premeditated plot of individuals in perfect concert with eachother may simply be the base human psychopathy running through these individuals governing the world&#39;s systems (banks, medicine, religion, education and so on) and so their actions are all in tune, and theybflow harmoniously, giving the illusion that there was a secret meeting at a big table one day where they hatched these evil master plans.</p>

<p>Maybe the truth is more insidious and frightening.</p>

<p>Maybe there was no meeting. </p>

<p>Maybe the individuals do not even consciously realize that they&#39;ve conspired and agreed to carry out evil. But every time they choose an action which promotes their power, and weakens the state of others, they add another brick to the house of the secret cabal, and they may not even be aware that they are a member.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, I guess what I&#39;m kind of thinking is that if we went over to John J. FederalReserve&#39;s home for dinner. And his wife Sally was there, and his kids were playing in the other room, and we were there to interview him over dessert and coffee, I don&#39;t think he would act like the sociopathic, scheming, scamming, probably pedophilic  bloodthirsty, greed monster that we imagine. That is not to say that he is NOT a sociopath, or greedy, or a pedophile even (let&#39;s say) but I guess I have a hard time subscribing to the idea that a cabal exists with the pure intent of evil. </p>

<p>I agree that if we trace the leaves to the branches to the roots of this, deep underneath in the muck, embedded in the darkness from which the evil grows, IS Federal Reserve, shadowy military industrial complex groups, colluding in the name of greed and power. Yes. But I don&#39;t think that individually THEY see it that way 100%. </p>

<p>Maybe I am still naive. </p>

<p>I welcome more information, proof otherwise, more eyeopeners. I&#39;ll take the truth whatever it is. I hate feeling ignorant on an issue. Maybe, even after the things I&#39;ve seen, a part of me is still too scared to admit that there are people who do evil for evil&#39;s sake OPENLY and PROUDLY in collusion. </p>

There are those who literally <em>cannot</em> feel empathy for another human being - it is a foreign emotion to them.  Their only enjoyment comes from imposing their will on others so it&#39;s difficult to apply &quot;logic&quot; to it all sometimes because <em>their</em> &quot;logic&quot; is not the same as <em>our</em> &quot;logic&quot;.</p>

<p>If you have a few hours to spare, I found some of these articles well researched and well-written - they were definite eye openers for me.  I think the rabbit hole goes deeper than any of us can really know.</p>

<p>It is kind of embarrassing/surprising that I have such a difficult time grasping the extent of sociopathy- as someone who studied it, worked with them 1-1, and is <em>relative to an average person, I think</em> more aware of the epidemic. But, somehow, when it gets to believing ALL THE WAY in the idea of the &quot;evil cabal&quot; ...my mind puts up this barrier of disbelief. However, you have to remember...I&#39;m new here, so to speak. It was only 2 years ago that I still believed the news, and defended my opinion as a registered Democrat, and thought that every vote counted, and in general, had the wool pulled so far over my eyes I was suffocating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. Satan is the one behind the scenes, whispering in the ears, pulling the strings from the very beginning.  Some refer to it as the &quot;mystery babylon&quot; as mentioned in Revelation. It is the overarching spiritual conspiracy for Satan to use man to build bigger, more centralized, and more powerful government to ultimately replace and overthrow God.  That&#39;s exactly what happened at Babel and exactly what the AntiChrist will try to do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The explanation that seems to work well is that we are about to hit the carrying capacity of the planet. World population is a function of energy abundance and global oil production is quite likely within a decade of peaking. Alternative energy technologies have shown some promise, but will be woefully inadequate as a substitute for oil. The &quot;fracking miracle&quot; that the US MSM bleats on about incessantly is widely regarded as bullshit in the US oil industry--fracked wells yield much less and decline far faster than conventional wells. Tight oil has provided a temporary reprieve by masking the fact that global conventional crude oil production peaked in 2005, but this situation can&#39;t be maintained for much longer. How long? Nobody knows. Some geologists claim global oil production (conventional + tight oil) will peak in 2014-2015 and others say 2020, but the teevee&#39;s estimates of 2040-2050 are regarded as optimistic propaganda by the oil industry. </p>

<p>The global elite are well aware of the situation, as they have access to the real oil production/reserve figures. I don&#39;t pretend to know what their plan is or if it is even as simple as that, as there may well be factions amongst them. However, some of the more obvious aspects of their strategies have become clear. Also, it is apparent that from the increase in brazenness and magnitude of their schemes, that their desperation has increased significantly over the last 20 years.  </p>

<p>Inadequate towards what? Alternative energy offers immense promise and the oil barons are scrambling to buy up all the new patents to maintain their control over the means of production. Fortunately, a lot of technologies are being open-source. They are arguably more than adequate for maintaining humanity&#39;s endeavours as they are sustainable and increase the pleasure of those endeavours. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A sum up of what I understood,correct me if i&#39;m wrong.</p>

<p>You said that all that is is for you only as well as me typing this to you and getting a response from you(actually myself) because that is what I want to receive? How can there be a next time/life cycle if in the end you stop thinking for yourself, even if reborn you won&#39;t remember this it will all stop.</p>

<p>Just saying but that theory is horrid for the mind, do not ever think of this otherwise you&#39;ll chain it to the thought of Death and than everything stopping. I had this happening before, where you think of existence and in the end everything turning black and it stopping. It&#39;s REALLY bad for you/us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m understanding you nor you understanding me. What I &quot;believe&quot; is I will live everyone&#39;s life that every is and every creature that has some adaptability movement (no plants i guess) and while I experience every single one individually, I never realize that I am each one. </p>

<p>So this horrid thing your talking about I don&#39;t understand. If you follow what I&#39;ve said I think there is an ultimate secondary reaction we feel day to day. A feeling as if you are &quot;mature&quot; relative to others. Have you ever met a child who was just so composed and down to earth and &quot;mature.&quot; That is what I am referring to. Since I am now aware of how this universe and life might work, I don&#39;t sense life as a burden of trying to get a job, acquire currency, eat, shit, sleep ... but rather day by day, grateful for what I have &quot;awaken&quot; into and what other lives I will or have gone through. You realize you can&#39;t help yourself (everyone) but you will/can help those you come to contact with. By help I don&#39;t mean give money, feed homeless, those are great but just the way you project and present yourself to others humans/animals (who are you, just not realizing their you) will &quot;help&quot; others just function more efficiently towards their own private goals. </p>

<p>Sorry for the long reply but I don&#39;t wrap my head down a negative void of darkness realizing death is meaningless. I would&#39;ve ended the game long ago, and that is not the point either. If I were born a slave, in torment, and then had this realization, yeah, different story. But I feel like even at an early age I was &quot;mature,&quot; and placed in a great position in our current world to experience it and understand it, and ultimately help others. How? Idk I&#39;m still young, I like to feel like I still have lots of &quot;presents or present days&quot; left haha, but who knows. </p>

<p>peace!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s not a metaphor, but it&#39;s difficult for our human perception (bc we believe in linear time) to really grasp that. I don&#39;t fight it, I don&#39;t go up to everyone and say you are me omg etc. I&#39;d look and sound crazy. The replies you send me in this theory is the same individual consciousness (call it soul, mind, whatever) communicating with itself, but those individual &quot;humans&quot; or &quot;bodies&quot; cannot process that information and only will experience any reactions or &quot;senses&quot; as an individual, hence over time believing that they are themselves a &quot;unique&quot; individual. </p>

<p>Here is a metaphor for this: We are ALL television, but instead feel like we are a unique 1 in 6+ Billion &quot;channels&quot;, when in our perceived Channel mental reality we cannot imagine what a TV feels like or truly is, that is the collective &quot;First Law of Thermo,&quot; essentially the TV. </p>

According to legend Abram had many children most notable Isaac and Ishmael.  Abram couldn&#39;t keep his dick in his pants, and only had but one son to his true wife, Sarah, Isaac. Who&#39;s truly <em>chosen by god</em> to rule that land? Isaac the only true son of Isaac or the bastard child Ishmael. By the way, Ishmael is considered a prophet in Islam and an ancestor to Muhammad, had some stuff to do with Mecca, etc etc etc. So there you have it our world is essentially controlled by Sibling Rivalry.</p>

<p>Of course you are going to feel helpless and hopeless and stay up all night shaking in fear at first. We&#39;ve all been there and it&#39;s completely normal. Don&#39;t let this shit ruin your day to day life though. Once you face the truth and start taking the steps you need to be prepared, you will not only feel better but you will feel empowered and in control. </p>

<p>These are the steps I have taken and continue to take to prepare myself and my family for the worst case scenario. I hope it never comes, but if it does, I know that me and my family will be much further ahead of the curve than the people that laughed at the idea that America could ever collapse:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make your family and loved ones aware of how you feel and why. Explain to them why you are stressed and why you are taking the steps you are.</p></li>
<li><p>Limit your exposure to the dollar. The QE bubble has to pop sooner or later. Buy real estate, buy bitcoins, exchange dollars for other currencies and/or gold. Anything. Just don&#39;t be left hanging with all your money in dollars.</p></li>
<li><p>BUY A RIFLE. Do not wait.</p></li>
<li><p>Have food and water on hand. God forbid there is ever a shortage.</p></li>
<li><p>Speak out. If ALL of us continue to SPEAK up about and call out the FUCKING FRAUDULENT pieces of shit that are destroying this country, there will be too many to round up just based on internet chatter. OBAMA IS A PSYCHOPATH MURDERER, there I said it.</p></li>
<li><p>Accept death and pray to God. Don&#39;t be afraid to die standing up for what you believe in. They can take your life but not your soul. Whether you believe in God or Blind Chance, we all must come to terms with the fact that some things are simply out of our hands. Say a prayer to Jesus Christ or The Spaghetti Monster, tell your family and friends you love them and have fun and enjoy life while you have it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, remember that knowing the truth is half the battle. Remember that when a Whistleblower comes out and gives up their life to tell you something &quot;crazy&quot; or &quot;tinfoil fedora conspiritarded&quot; that they know that&#39;s how the public will react. They know that they will be called a pyscho and a &quot;conspiritard&quot; and BE KILLED but they still speak the truth. And for that, you have to hear them out and listen to their stories and take them seriously. Because if you don&#39;t, you won&#39;t be prepared for the moment their words come true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the only conspiracies of many(I&#39;ve seen most years and years ago and i&#39;m only 18) that is actually believable. I sure will do more research on this. Although as i&#39;m this young as much as i&#39;d want to I&#39;m not sure how to get a gun legally(Kind of hard in The Netherlands) but I&#39;ll try my best, i&#39;ve always wanted an ACR or AR-15 perhaps even a Carbine and if it gets desperate an AK. To bad about the real estate i&#39;m still a student BUT I&#39;ve been hogging on some gold which&#39;ll help me out later indeed! Luckily I&#39;ve been raised Christian so I&#39;m fine on that part and I even as black person never acknowledged Obama, who gives a fuck about skin color if you fuck up your job you&#39;re just as bad as any president. I really take Whistleblowers for granted and am very grateful for them I know most of them already but a few I haven&#39;t seen yet. Thanks man Bless you!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simple. The west is controlled by two political ideologies. Jewish Bolsheviks(Communist) and Jewish Zionist(Socialist). Democrats in America mostly in the soft Communism camps and the Republicans mainly in the Zionist camps. I say camps plural because there are different extremes in each side, some more subtle and some more open and aggressive about the agenda. Some in these camps have no clue about where their ideogy originates, they are the low IQ dimwits who are easily whipped into a lather to get an agenda item through when needed. Useful idiots is the term often used. Its this way in Europe also with the Conservatives(Zionist) and the Democratic Socialist(more soft Communist). Anyway, this is just a CONSPIRACY Theory, its definately not true. Now, I am taking my tinfoil hat off.... ;)... all satire my friends. Don&#39;t get your panties in a wad. </p>
