        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is always a lot of talk on here but I don&#39;t recall seeing a post saying &quot;Here I am at XXXXX protesting XXXXX&quot;. That&#39;s what we need. Now is the time for action. </p>

<p>How many of you are spreading the word with your workmates, families and friends? There are now mountains of verifiable evidence out there covering major issues which seem to continue to go unchallenged.</p>

<p>I myself am participating in a major rally at my nations capital later today. (<a href="http://marchinmarch.com.au/canberra/">http://marchinmarch.com.au/canberra/</a>) Hopefully I will be able to attend more events such as this but I already spread the word at my workplace, with my friends and family. I can say from personal experience people are starting to wake up on a wide scale here. People from multiple walks of life are starting to see the world for what it has become. I no longer get dismissed as crazy for my views and the people I speak with are genuinely concerned/angry.</p>

<p>What are you doing to help the fight against these shadow agendas outside the digital world?</p>

<p>“Those who profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation, are people who want crops without ploughing the ground; they want rain without thunder and lightning; they want the ocean without the roar of its many waters. The struggle may be a moral one, or it may be a physical one, or it may be both. But it must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.” </p>

<p>― Frederick Douglass </p>

Not the easiest thing since this area is religious/conservative for the most part and still brainwashed patriotic.  Rallies and awareness are step 1 to the long term goal of breaking the fuck away from this failed concept of a country unified under a federal gov&#39;t that doesn&#39;t represent anything except the interests of big business anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people have succumbed to Bernays propaganda.</p>

<p>They will reject any and all information that is against their induced programming.</p>

<p>Bernays postulated that the everage peoson never thinks much if at all about the world situation and could be fooled very easily by the repetition of any information that the government or corporate interests want to implant in them by the simple technique of having &#39;experts&#39; repeat propaganda to them.</p>

<p>The only way around this programming is education about Edward Bernays propaganda and PR techniques and their effectiveness.</p>

<p>I have soilicited the help of <a href="/r/psychology">/r/psychology</a> in this regard and been soundly rejected.</p>

<p>We need their help to spread the information and the reason the population rejects &quot; conspiracy theories&quot; which is itself a propaganda term. </p>

<p>Origin of the term Conspiracy Theory.</p>
