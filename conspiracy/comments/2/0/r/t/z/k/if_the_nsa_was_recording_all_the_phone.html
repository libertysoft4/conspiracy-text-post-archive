<p>The notable phone calls were made from Flight 93.  We&#39;re on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and you still think that a plane crashed in shanksville, pa?  For the first time ever, a plane crashed into the ground and was vaporized??  There was no plane.  There were no phone calls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be that they want us to think they can be lost.  Or they could have hidden it.  I am not quite on board with any missing plane conspiracy theories, but if we explore that scenario, I think it&#39;s quite possible all of the tracking systems could have been tampered with.  Even if they flew by a cell tower, it is easy to destroy 200-some cell phones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember that will smith movie where they took control of satellites real time in 1998? 3 years before 911. Before the patriot act and other surveillance state laws and practices exploded into existence? 1998 was 16 years ago. Are we to believe there are no satellites aimed at the direction of where the plane was flying with no redundancy in 2014 when the NSA and all govt have pretty much come out and admitted they are recording everything? Do the satellites not have the capability to record? Why do most people I and everyone else assume we currently have this technology in place? If the people in charge of this sort of thing wanted to, could they not review their recordings starting with where and when the plane took off then follow where it went? If they do have this technology and are still not telling us what happened then only reasonable assumption is that they don&#39;t want us to know. </p>
