        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I dont want to believe that the plane was hijacked by the US and landed on the small island, Diego Garcia. But its not ruled out as a possibility..actually all this new information coming out about the planes flight record points closer and closer to the US base. </p>

<p>I think if our government would or had something to do this i will lose all faith of our government and all my trust and faith will be gone.  </p>

<p>Heres some things that are interesting</p>

You are a coward for even bringing up what the majority quickly dismisses!  It is like you think the U.S. has just made planes disappear when they hit....idk...the pentagon or something!  </p>

<p>Jk!  There are several interesting posts about this.  I suggest you add your insights and thoughts.   I am still unsure about motivations, but this is fishy.  If we have such an important base why didnt that base have radar info?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possible Motive for landing at Diego Garcia:</p>

<p>There is another post on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> right now <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/20qz46/mangosteen_cargo_on_mh370/">here</a> discussing the possibility that 3 tons of cargo on the plane (not a small amount) was actually out of season fruit at a time in the country when growing seasons have not been so good.</p>

<p>Is it possible that this was actually a covert transfer of some kind to Diego Garcia?  </p>

<p>The question then becomes if they were trying to secretly move something, why did the media make such a big deal about it?  You&#39;d think that they would keep quiet about it in cooperation with the government...</p>

<p>My personal theory is that the transfer was outed by an enemy of the USA.  They could not, not acknowledge a missing 777.  It&#39;s too big and too new.  So they make a big loud noise about it in the news for a few days and generally bullshit the public as much as possible until the news cycle is over, then back to Ukraine or Bieber or whatever else.</p>

<p>Edit:  Also the 6 week cycle.</p>

<p>Also the 20 semiconductor company employees</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because a military plane itself is conspicuous.  The planes that fly workers to area 51 from Las Vegas are regular plain 737s with only a tail number.</p>

<p>I admit there are other parts of this theory that are less easily explained such as the families of people on the plane shown on the MSM.  Who would they be then? Actors? Were only some of the people on the plane killed?  Obviously there are some issues there...</p>

<p>I do entertain the electrical fire theory as the most plausable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you trace the point where the transponder was turned off through the plane&#39;s last radar contact in the strait, that line points right at Diego Garcia. </p>

<p>The arcs provided by the satellite ping suggests a north or south path, but it&#39;s based on the transmission of a single ping received by a satellite that received five further pings. If they calculated the arcs for the other pings, a clear picture of the path should have been clear, but that data hasn&#39;t been released. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, residents of the Maldives report seeing a low flying jumbo jet at 6:15a local time flying in the direction of Diego Garcia: <a href="http://m.huffpost.com/uk/entry/4986445?utm_hp_ref=uk">http://m.huffpost.com/uk/entry/4986445?utm_hp_ref=uk</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d add to this that the early stories about the Maldives all confirmed the jet seen was bearing MA red stripes and was travelling north to south west. That is what is stated in the Huffpost article you&#39;ve linked. </p>

<p>Interestingly, you&#39;ll find that on all articles about the Maldives plane sighting dated on the 19th, the quote remains more or less identical, however the direction has changed to north west to south EAST. This can be seen here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/missing-malaysia-airlines-plane-maldives-discounted-as-possible-location-for-mh370-20140319-hvkjq.html">http://www.smh.com.au/world/missing-malaysia-airlines-plane-maldives-discounted-as-possible-location-for-mh370-20140319-hvkjq.html</a></p>

<p>Then, a day later the Maldives military come to the conclusion that no plane passed over at all, even though it confirmed it the day before.</p>

<p>If this is never found, then it&#39;s because it&#39;s at Diego Garcia.</p>
