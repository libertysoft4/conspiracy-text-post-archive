<p>In mid-1911, nearly a year before the Titanic&#39;s maiden voyage, publications such as the <em>Irish News and Belfast Morning News</em> and <em>Shipbuilder</em> printed detailed articles about the ship&#39;s construction and noted that &quot;The Captain may, by simply moving an electric switch, instantly close the doors throughout and make the vessel practically unsinkable.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to play this game...  Does the word &#39;advertise&#39; only apply to those who own/work for/on the ship when they speak of it? I feel as if you are saying, speaking of a item without holding a stake in it (i.e captain, ship owner) is something other than advertising it.  I would argue that the papers saying such is a form of advertising, albeit by a third party.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Capt. Smith maintained that shipbuilding was such a perfect art nowadays that absolute disaster, involving the passengers on a great modern liner, was quite unthinkable. Whatever happened, he contended, there would be time before the vessel sank to save the lives of every person on board. </p>

<p>&quot;I will go a bit further,&quot; he said. &quot;I will say that I cannot imagine any condition which could cause a ship to founder. I cannot conceive of any vital disaster happening to this vessel. Modern shipbuilding has gone beyond that.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you actually understand how redundancy works? </p>

<p>This is an honest question, because this comment tree began with one person not understanding that analog equipment is used as one part of a significant failsafe system (the whole &quot;playing Flight Sim X with the monitor off&quot; was just icing on the cake of ignorance), then another guy who appears ignorant of the relevant field of engineering. Honestly, your comment amused me the most: the combination of ignorance and arrogance when someone implied a level of sophistication in aircraft engineering was priceless. (It&#39;s almost like you <em>actually think</em> you&#39;re being clever.) It&#39;s not like aerospace and aeronautical engineers study basically <a href="http://www.ae.utexas.edu/attachments/article/322/2014-2016DegreePlanFlowChart.pdf">the same university curriculum</a> or anything.</p>

<p>I understand you <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> lot view yourselves as &quot;free thinkers&quot;, so why not &quot;free think&quot; yourself onto a YouTube video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA9Kato1CxA">component stress tests</a> instead?</p>
