        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It appears that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has become less of a place for inquiry and discussion, and more of a place for experiments in trollery.</p>

<p>I surf /new mostly, and I see tons of amateur trolls (newbies to <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> trying to score troll points in their sub) posting stupid garbage, accompanied by floods of link spammers trying to get blogspot.com referral links, all burying anything even remotely resembling content relevant to this subreddit.</p>

<p>The deluge of distraction and outright trollery has made it a tiresome chore to find anything even remotely worth discussing.</p>

<p>Under attack? No. More like being buried.</p>

<p>I made the mistake if dismissing <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> as &quot;hecklers&quot; the other day, because it seems some of them put a lot of thought and teamwork into very subtle and pointed plans to undermine this subreddit.</p>

<p>What does this mean?</p>

<p>Well, sure it means that they don&#39;t want us investigating certain topics.</p>

<p>It&#39;s okay if we rehash the old standards: JFK, 9/11, etc. because they have their list of pre-prepared responses to any inquisitive comment. But, there&#39;s apparently a great deal more effort being expended on more recent topics.</p>

<p>With reference to the recent Sandy Hook trollery, AssuredlyAThrowAway pointed out</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know how much ridicule they managed to pull off; if anything they pointed a giant spotlight on reddit inc messing around with the free flow of information. Strangest troll I&#39;ve ever seen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>... but, coming from a mod of this subreddit, a sub which has a moderator history of highlighting its own hypocrisy, I don&#39;t know how much I&#39;m willing to invest in this as a credible counter-argument. (Don&#39;t get me wrong here, this isn&#39;t an attack on Assuredly - it&#39;s an observation of the evolution of this sub&#39;s moderation -- to one of constantly being on the defense.)</p>

<p>I mean... isn&#39;t it possible that the admins discovered something deeper than the superficial trolling? Maybe that the whole subreddit in question had been discovered to contain elements of similar corruption? My understanding is that it was a private sub - possibly a development ground for this planned scam. I wasn&#39;t a privileged invitee, so I have no idea what was going on there to get the sub closed.</p>

<p>Did <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> get gamed? Well, that&#39;s a no-brainer. <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> got one of their troll posts stickied to the top of this subreddit. And this, only a few short days after bpb0 confessed to having done experiments here in the past.</p>

<p>But, it&#39;s more than that. The immediately preceding stickied posts were about &quot;cellphones ringing&quot; in reference to the missing plane and a PSA to one of the moderators pet projects. (Come on, guys - you&#39;ve never called a cellphone which seemed to be ringing, but later you found out that the person you were calling had turned it off?)</p>

<p>What concerns me, just as much as the high-fiving <a href="/r/conspiratards">/r/conspiratards</a> do over their trollery, is the embarrassing way this subreddit has devolved into being its own worst enemy.</p>

<p>The waters here are now so muddied by all of these things (external tainting of the well by trolls, and the internal festering rot of believing &quot;authority&quot; is a solution), it&#39;s becoming hard to find a clean source from which to drink the waters of knowledge.</p>

<p>What concerns me is the inability of people to recognise it&#39;s gone down hill because you don&#39;t know who&#39;s making the stupid assertions and comments. If you recognise that people are posting shit on purpose, recognise that people are being more subtle, not announcing their trolling and mixing in posting absolute bull shit.</p>

<li><p>Start reporting people to the mods and then the admins if trolling continues</p></li>
<li><p>Stop talking about <a href="/r/conspiritard">/r/conspiritard</a> and don&#39;t cross post from there</p></li>
<li><p>Ban the bot that keeps telling us that <a href="/r/conspiritard">/r/conspiritard</a> has made a post because it creates drama we don&#39;t need</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it would not be. Stalking is the act of following one person. As far as i can see there is no rule against highlighting the posting history of a category of users.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stalking is unwanted or obsessive attention by an individual or group toward another person. Stalking behaviors are related to harassment and intimidation and may include following the victim in person or monitoring them. The word stalking is used, with some differing meanings, in psychology and psychiatry and also in some legal jurisdictions as a term for a criminal offense.</p>

<p>According to a 2002 report by the National Center for Victims of Crime, &quot;Virtually any unwanted contact between two people [that intends] to directly or indirectly communicates a threat or places the victim in fear can be considered stalking&quot;[1] although in practice the legal standard is usually somewhat stricter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The commentor above is not referring to following people. The comment is talking about responding to comments that show up in this subreddit. Merely making people aware of truthful information does not qualify as threatening, harassment or intimidation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not sure if you eluded to this, but the trolling is far from organic.  This has probably been said before, but many popular public discussion sites are full of astroturfing sockpuppets, and reddit is no exception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is quite evident, and yes I did allude to it.</p>

<p>First (from my follow-up reading), it appears that <a href="/u/Mindsequalone">/u/Mindsequalone</a> - the troll who posted the Sandy Hook submission which resulted in closing down the subreddit <a href="/r/SandyHookJustice">/r/SandyHookJustice</a> - was actually the <em>creator</em> of that subreddit. This carries the implication that it was a premeditated act with lots of planning and organizing prior to the final result (the trolling here). The entire subreddit was the development ground for an elaborately orchestrated troll of this subreddit... from start to finish. (Which, by the way, <em>should</em> be grounds for the admins to refuse to grant it to the recent member of <a href="/r/SubredditDrama">/r/SubredditDrama</a> member who requested it for the purpose of converting its mission - the subreddit was created for the purpose of trolling... it shouldn&#39;t be granted to someone who loves to read about trolling.)</p>

<p>And I also alluded to the bpb0 (<a href="/u/bipolarbear0">/u/bipolarbear0</a>) confession of having extensively trolled this subreddit with racist posts.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t post links to either of these, because I don&#39;t like to feed the thread invasion process. If you want to know more about them, there&#39;s plenty of info floating around reddit.</p>

<p><a href="/r/SubredditDrama">/r/SubredditDrama</a> and <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> are, it seems, the two groups which like to feed the ongoing degradation of this subreddit the most (source: my long memory and their long track records). Without doing actual tracking of specific users, I can&#39;t actually prove the following statement, thus it&#39;s just an observational hypothesis... but... </p>

<p>From time to time, it appears these two groups tend to feed one another where <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is concerned -- one group trolls <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and the other group reports on the results of the trolling.</p>

<p>When the <a href="/r/conspiritard">/r/conspiritard</a> folks march in with their vote brigade it can make things very confusing. I hope on their deathbeds they can comprehend the evils of interfering with the free flow of information.</p>
