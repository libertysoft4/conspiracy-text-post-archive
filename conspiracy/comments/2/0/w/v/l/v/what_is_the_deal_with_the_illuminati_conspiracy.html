        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi. I need to get some clarification on this whole conspiracy. What makes peaople thing og the illuminaty as an tyrannical satanic group plotting world domination, when the original Bavariab illuminati stood for the compleate oppisite? They wanted a world without the dominance of state and church, and was built upon the ideals of the age of reason.</p>

<p>I cannot see how anybody who ever did any reading on the history of the illuminati can think any thing else? It seems absurd. </p>

<p>So why does this conspiracy theory still exist? Dont people read anymore? It seems the whole satanic idea comes from the fundamentalist christian ideas in america, and if you ask me, then those are the greatest threat too freedom of the individual.</p>

<p>Thats my two cents. Please let me know your opinion on this matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to sate that the phrase &quot;Illuminati&quot; itself is probably a poor way to describe the current state of affairs. Throughout history there have been many groups, both occult and widely known that sought to consolidate power for either the benefit of mankind of for their own personal objectives. While the Bavarian Illuminati might have had good intentions, what we describe today as &quot;The Illuminati&quot; is a grouping of occult elites of the highest echelons of power working for their own ends at the expense of the people who helped them consolidate such power. </p>

<p>Of course with matters of the church things get more complicated. Sexual and other taboo practices accompany the hedonistic lifestyles most of these elites live. The satanic description is most likely an indictment of the values and practices they hold which are completely at odds with the teachings of the Bible (anti-corruption, anti-wealth, anti-sexual taboos, etc.) Some religious groups, especially catholics and muslims, love to turn movements against corruption into outright holy wars. Theres no evidence to suggest that &quot;The Illuminati&quot; actively worship anything other than money or power.</p>

<p>I disagree. There is certainly a &quot;religion&quot; of the elite, based within occultism. Whether or not they actually believe it, or just use it to create a control hierarchy among themselves is debatable though. </p>

<p>As Russel Brand said - What else is there once you&#39;ve got all the money, power and sex there is? The search for &quot;enlightenment&quot; and spiritual truth. </p>

<p>At the very least, I&#39;m sure the elite worry about what happens when they die, seeing as all the money and power in the world can&#39;t make them immortal. </p>

<p>It makes sense too for the elite to have their own religions and spiritual practices as a point of common interest. I think it would make it less likely for them to back-stab each other, and give them common goals to work towards that benefit them all. </p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;ve read a lot of evidence of this - most of it is in old books though, not online.</p>

<p>Bingo.  There is a crap ton of nonsense that stems not from actual fact and conspiracy, but from a religious base that see&#39;s the devil in every shadow.  Reality is most conspiracy that is real stems from one thing.  The desire for power.  </p>

<p>When I was growing up, my parents taught me that the Mormon Church was a cult.  Now they voted for Romney and deny they ever taught that until I broke out sunday school sheets they notated that I have saved (I&#39;m a pack rat).  </p>

<p>Things change, but the desire for power does not.  Every religion/cult is working towards the same thing.  More followers and more power and authority. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. It would have been called a &quot;cult&quot;. Because all the bizarre shit and chants that they do. Theses are power players in politics and they are all worshipping satan together. Its a proven fact. Watch the video.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about what you are saying.  Have you ever been to catholic mass? Chanting is only bizarre to you because its out of the ordinary.  If that was the norm, the major religion, it wouldn&#39;t be a cult.  </p>

<p>Saying something you consider bizarre does not make it a cult.  If the worlds largest religion was what ever they are doing at Bohemian Grove, and the people at BG were doing catholic rituals and chants (like eating bread saying its actually becoming the body of christ) then Catholic Christianity would be the cult, and what ever they do at BG would be the religion. </p>

<p>Cults aren&#39;t determined by how odd they seem to you right now.  They are determined by whether they have practices and beliefs that differ from the accepted social norms.  Make them the accepted norm in society and they are no longer the cult.  They are the religion.  </p>

<p>What they do at BG has no effect on what I said.  Its only considered a cult because its so different.  And if the accepted norm is weird and odd chants and beliefs, then they cease to be weird and odd at all and become the accepted religion. </p>

<p>Ok, so what&#39;s your point? Are you just saying that Satanism isn&#39;t bad, it only seems bad because it&#39;s esoteric? What are you getting at?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a proven fact that there are Satan Worshipping secret societies in the upper echelon of our political, military and even media professions.

    <div class="md"><p>Gotcha. Agreed. But if Luciferianism was the main religion, I bet a lot of these people would become Christian lol. I think the point of the cults is actually to just have a small group of people that stands in opposition to the &quot;masses&quot;. If &quot;common folk&quot; believe in Jesus, the elites will believe in Lucifer. If the &quot;common folk&quot; believe in Lucifer, the elites would probably believe in Jesus or some other teaching that says the elites are somehow different and better than everyone else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And then there are dangerous cults.  These will never get to religion size because they prey on the weakest among us for their followers.  Their money, their resources, even their bodies.  </p>

<p>You are dead on about the elites of the world.  I get the distinct &quot;we can&#39;t be the same as those lower people&quot; vibe when discussing religion/cults that elite powers practice.  Just feels like they see themselves as above even to the point that they can make their own religion to follow in order to remain above looking down.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its based on observation of the current practices of occult elite. I cannot comment on the historical bavarian illuminati, I do not know enough, but suffice it to say that with these groups, such as with the Church of Satan, information they present about themselves is public relations to conceal their true goals and initiatives.</p>

<p>The most damning evidence is ritual abuse. </p>

<p><a href="http://ritualabuse.us/ritualabuse/articles/an-empirical-look-at-the-ritual-abuse-controversy-randy-noblitt-phd/">http://ritualabuse.us/ritualabuse/articles/an-empirical-look-at-the-ritual-abuse-controversy-randy-noblitt-phd/</a></p>

<p>Occult elite on an international scale are subjecting children to extreme physical and sexual abuse on a regular basis. (inb4 &#39;this is debunked&#39;, the attempted debunking is a joke perpetrated by pedophiles and MK-ULTRA perpetrators)</p>

<p>the goal is mind control, either subservience to the cult or for the creation of manchurian candidates.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.whale.to/b/greenbaum.html">http://www.whale.to/b/greenbaum.html</a></p>

<p>These groups also protect and sanction global child trafficking and child abuse rings.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.whale.to/b/pedophocracy.html">http://www.whale.to/b/pedophocracy.html</a></p>

<p>It is for these reasons that many people consider this covert network of elite to be as you describe. I understand it sounds absolutely ludicrous. But I promise if you read these three links, from bottom to top, you will at the minimum have a thorough understanding of the thought process.</p>

<p>The world is rudderless.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually the opposite. The world as a shared experience of individuals is created through individuals enforcing their will on their environments, by themselves and in collectives.</p>

<p>Behind every change in reality on a large scale is a conscious decision and action by an individual or group. Most people do not try to change their environment beyond the directly observable (house, workplace, etc) and take a &quot;just along for the ride&quot; approach to their lives. Others spend literally every waking moment trying to subdue and control their environment, at greater and greater scales. </p>

<p>In this way a kind of power hierarchy forms on a global scale. </p>

<p>Today, an individual with a computer connection can create content designed to change others opinions and thus actions, that reaches millions of people. The same goes for the elites who also use mass dissemination technology like TV and the internet to manipulate us. </p>

<p>Study MK Ultra, Edward Bernays, human psychology and other relevant topics. Designing human behavior has been turned into a scientific process.</p>

<p>Almost everything you believe and think is a world view carefully constructed by people you&#39;ve never met.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Illuminati&quot; is a catch-all term to describe the secret societies that control the upper echelon of corporate and political power. There is a historic group called the Bavarian Order of the Illuminati which is an Order of the Quest. But &quot;illuminati&quot; as it is commonly used is just a general term for the powers that be.</p>

<p>Currently, our political and banking structure is controlled by the Jesuit Order. The Vatican, Skull and Bones, and the Bush cabal are all sects of the Jesuit Order. The Navy and Air Force are infamously composed of mostly Blue Lodge Freemasons. The Bavarian Order of the Illuminati subverted and infiltrated the Blue Lodge of Freemasonry in France in the 18th century but were exposed and exiled out of masonry.</p>

<p>What people need to remember is that Secret Societies are not bad in themselves. There are actually many benevolent secret societies that are actually seeking esoteric knowledge lost to time. Manly P Hall, the famous    Rosicrucian, was benevolent in my eyes and the Order of the Quest is itself benevolent. The problem is that many of these Orders (skull and bones) have become so corrupted that they are literally just boys clubs and criminal cabals and have nothing to so with the true Order of the Quest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea than a single all-powerful group is at the heart of all conspiracies and crimes against humanity is a simplification which does absolutely no service to truth-seekers. There are many powerful individuals and groups, and they often do have common interests. The NSA spying on activists is in the interest of many corporations and it is also in the interest of dedicated neocon ideologues, for example. And yes, some of them are into weird occult beliefs and practices, but certainly not all of them. These various powerful individuals and groups also fight amongst each other on a regular basis. The most accurate phrase I&#39;ve ever heard to describe the situation is a &quot;band of hostile brothers&quot;. They&#39;ll band together to stop a genuine socialist uprising in a resource-rich third-world country, but in the meantime they&#39;re still happy to stab one another in the back in the scramble for more personal wealth and power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What makes peaople thing og the illuminaty as an tyrannical satanic group plotting world domination, when the original Bavariab illuminati stood for the compleate oppisite?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think about this: how many Illuminati documents have you actually read? The overwhelming majority of primary documents on the order remain in German. Even worse, the vast amount of academic secondary literature on the Illuminati remains untranslated as well. The only major sources of primary documents available in English are the translations found in Barruel&#39;s <em>Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism</em> and Robison&#39;s <em>Proofs of a Conspiracy</em>; both of which are conspiratorial texts that assume a malevolent Illuminati. It is important to note that there&#39;s been a trend of whitewashing the order by some historians, a good example is <a href="http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/texts/illuminati.html">Trevor W. McKeown&#39;s &quot;Bavarian Illuminati Primer&quot;</a> and that early conspiracy theories, especially in Germany, were at least partially justified. Because of the enormous popularity of Robison and Barruel (especially Barruel) and the lack of access to more neutral collections of primary documents, conspiracy theories flourished and grew more and more disconnected with the historical Illuminati. More often than not, as evidenced by this thread, people are aware of this and don&#39;t see the disconnect as something significant.</p>

<p>The satanism bit is probably a mixture of the Taxil Hoax and the Christian influences in American conspiracism.</p>

However, from Adam Weiseff&#39;s own writings, he planned to have the Illuminati exist within other groups, such as Freemasons, and reform under different names and within other groups if they are ever caught.

    <div class="md"><p>f one were to attempt to summarize the Illuminati conspiracy, it would go something like this: The Illuminati began as a secret society under the direction of Jesuit priests. Later, a council of five men, one for each of the points on the pentagram, formed what was called “The Ancient and Illuminated Seers of Bavaria.” They were high order Luciferian Freemasons, thoroughly immersed in mysticism and Eastern mental disciplines, seeking to develop the super powers of the mind. Their alleged plan and purpose is world domination for their lord (who precisely this lord is varies widely). The Illuminati are alleged to be the primary motivational forces encouraging global governance, a one-world religious ethic, and centralized control of the world’s economic systems. Organizations such as the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the International Criminal Court are seen as tentacles of the Illuminati. According to the Illuminati conspiracy, the Illuminati are the driving force behind efforts to brainwash the gullible masses through thought control and manipulation of beliefs, through the press, the educational curriculum, and the political leadership of the nations.
The Illuminati supposedly have a private board of elite, interlocking delegates who control the world’s major banks. They create inflations, recessions, and depressions and manipulate the world markets, supporting certain leaders and coups and undermining others to achieve their overall goals. The supposed goal behind the Illuminati conspiracy is to create and then manage crises that will eventually convince the masses that globalism, with its centralized economic control and one-world religious ethic, is the necessary solution to the world’s woes. This structure, usually known as the “New World Order,” will, of course, be ruled by the Illuminati.</p>

<p>Lol. So if a new law is brought in by the government that affects me, it&#39;s just coincidence? It&#39;s not the governments fault! It&#39;s nobody&#39;s fault!

<p>I know this is a gross exaggeration, and not really what you were suggesting, but this is the problem I have with these vague &quot;It&#39;s all coincidence&quot; ideas. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not coincidence when there is evidence tying the actions of one group with a negative outcome in reality. </p>

<p>Sure, scapegoating takes place, but that doesn&#39;t mean the large collectives of people you listed who often work together towards mutually beneficial goals don&#39;t deserve blame for certain things they&#39;re responsible for. </p>

<p>When you do a little research, you begin to understand why all of those groups you mentioned are blamed. They&#39;re all related, and all part of the bigger picture. </p>
