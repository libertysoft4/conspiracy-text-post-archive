        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">112</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2014-03-20 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/PublicIntelAnalyst.html">PublicIntelAnalyst</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>1984 was required reading for me in High School. The most frightening theme (for me) from that book - a theme which has lingered with me for 35 years - is that even the <em>underground</em> is controlled by big brother, as a mechanism for reintegration of workers into the system.</p>

<p>The above, while my paraphrase may not seem all that scary (I&#39;m not a suspense novelist), is absolutely terrifying as a concept at this point in the evolution of this subreddit.</p>

<p>I remember when this subreddit had no rules. </p>

<p>I remember when talking about &quot;them&quot; (Our Beloved Reptilian Overlords, the Rothschild Zionists and International Banking Cartel) was mocked because &quot;having secret code words&quot; was too difficult for &quot;them&quot; to infiltrate. </p>

<p>I remember when Jewish Interests invaded this subreddit (JIDF). </p>

<p>I remember when the reddit powers that be recognized the significance of this subreddit decided it needed active moderation (you don&#39;t honestly believe that &quot;illuminatedwax&quot; is just some random internet guy out there, do you?).</p>

<p>I remember when the first rule was written, based on cries of anti-semitism surrounding this subreddit.</p>

<p>And, now... here we are, a couple very short years later...</p>

<p>There are now 10 rules, many of which prevent the user-base of the sub from retaliating against the shill invasion. (yeah, the implication here is that Big Brother PWNed this sub)</p>

<p>And, while the above is frustrating (especially since I got suckered into supporting that first rule on the slippery slope), it isn&#39;t near as frightening as the way Sandy Hook is being leveraged as controlled opposition.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s a real conspiracy behind Sandy Hook, I think this is it... the way it&#39;s being used here.</p>

<p><strong>A week or so ago, <a href="/r/SandyHookJustice">/r/SandyHookJustice</a> was closed and its</strong> <strong><em>creator</em></strong> <strong>was shadowbanned</strong> (for, among other things, gaming/trolling this subreddit - which they bragged about to <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> - but it gets worse).</p>

<p>Just yesterday, I was contacted by <strong>a one week old username</strong> who invited me to <em>another</em> Sandy Hook subreddit - asking me to keep it a secret. Ok. I can do that. I won&#39;t reveal the name of the subreddit, or the six-day-old username who created that sub. But, I won&#39;t keep it a secret that you - whoever you are - thought it was &quot;odd&quot; that I was distrustful of you (look at the boldface emphasis in this paragraph). </p>

<p>When this person confessed, today, to being the same person (<a href="/u/Mindsequalone">/u/Mindsequalone</a> and the new username which ends in 221), I&#39;ve begun questioning how many people are behind those usernames (the Snopes debunking couple kept coming to mind as an example possibility - I don&#39;t think it&#39;s specifically them, but possibly someone <em>like</em> them).</p>

<p>They claim to be &quot;clean as a whistle&quot;, but reddit banned them for <em>something</em> - and referenced specific rules in the process. Are they (whoever they are) legit? Good question. I don&#39;t have that answer. Considering the frequency that some legitimate users have been banned/shadowbanned on reddit, does &quot;their getting shadowbanned&quot; make them &quot;one of us&quot;. Absolutely not. They are, at best, special interest group who refuses keep their trash in their own yard.</p>

<p>However, back to the point at hand here, I want to remind everyone who has read this far into this post: Big Brother is watching you, and will surely (by this time) be using the underground as a means of - at minimum - locating those whose minds still dissent.</p>

<p>But, it&#39;s worse than that. The various forces at play in this subreddit - the forces vying for control of your mind - are NOT operating in orchestrated synchronization. They are many and varied. And eventually...</p>

<p>Eventually, there will be one of them who sounds like me... who sounds like a voice of reasoned dissent. But, that one will be telling you that this is the real underground - that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and its offshoot specialized subreddits is/are as deep into the underground as you can ever go. </p>

<p>Read my words carefully here: if reddit is &quot;the front page of the internet&quot;, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a barricaded doorway. </p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was, at one time, a valuable portal into discovering the corruption of your owners. But, now barricaded, it has become a poster-board of notices against speaking your mind - from the rules in the sidebar to the trolls and shills who shut you down with derision, dismissal and derailment, at every turn. This subreddit may be a &quot;thinking&quot; ground, but it is most certainly <em>not</em> a &quot;speaking&quot; ground. (Someone will likely claim that my post and my claim here are evidence to the contrary - but, think for a moment about all of the things I cannot say here. The claims I cannot make, regardless of their truth value or justifiability. There are simply some things that I cannot say, period, if I want to also maintain the level of decorum required for the &quot;new credibility threshold&quot; of this subreddit.)</p>

<p>Your mind is still free for as long as you put effort into retaining that freedom, but it won&#39;t be for long if you allow yourself to have your freedoms chiseled away, little by little. </p>

<p>Many, already, if they knew true freedom, would run from it in fear, pleading with their owners to protect them from too much freedom.</p>

<p>Is there a conspiracy related to Sandy Hook? Quite likely, and I find it a curious thing to watch.</p>

<p>Is/was <a href="/r/SandyHookJustice">/r/SandyHookJustice</a> (and related subs) an exercise in controlling the opposition? I think it&#39;s a possibility with a significant degree of likelihood; you may not. </p>

<p>Is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> compromised? Those who have left this sub already will have a different answer to that question than those who participate in the present. My personal opinion should be clear from this post.</p>

<p>The better question, though, is: Has your mind been compromised?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will have to second this post.  I think it is now impossible to know the truth.  The truth is far too valuable to let average people have much of it.  They are allowed to have enough to remain alive (for now), but the truth that will &quot;set us free&quot; is kept tightly and securely guarded and we will never have access to it.  Ever.</p>

<p>My advice to people is to try very hard to depend on government and other people as little as possible.  Live happy.  Love your families and live for the moment.  Seek out pleasurable things and do them as much as you can while you can.</p>

<p>We really have no ability to change the course of human events so we might as well enjoy the life we have as much as we can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not much of conspiracy theorist, not so much I don&#39;t believe that there &quot;are more things under heaven and earth Horatio than are dreamt of in your philosopy&quot; as simply because I don&#39;t like people trying to convince me what I should be thinking.</p>

<p>A lot of conspiracy is as full of hearsay as anything &quot;mainstream&quot;, imo.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that&#39;s very arguable. My point is only that when we start to dismiss too much of what we read as being compromised, then those who hope for the success of social engineering will have won the war, and the little skirmishes here and there that survive and seem interesting will just be entertainment to keep idle minds amused.</p>

<p>Accept that it&#39;s all compromised: continue to read and listen and make your own connections.  There is very likely more than a single truth out there: find the voices that ring true and make sense to you most of the time.  Staying skeptical is healthy, but it&#39;s a far cry from being dismissive.</p>

<p>Also...below you mention not really digging into people&#39;s post history before you invite them to your secret No Trolls Allowed subreddit. That seems like a poor strategy, ya? Why not do the basic homework required to even have a chance at creating an alternate and productive subreddit? </p>

<li><p>Shill is new. Yeah, although I have been &#39;researching&#39;- reading about Sandy Hook- i have been going to the source for my own info- and had not read anything in any forums like this, or even watched any &quot;truther&quot; video type things to try to keep a really objective view point on it. I never looked into another &quot;conspiracy&quot; or posted on other message boards- Sandy Hook is unique to me for certain reasons, not a &quot;entertainment point&quot; or a hobby.</p></li>
<li><p>Not digging? Yeah kind of dumb I guess but really....Because reddit is a helpful tool- kind of interesting, get others&#39; views on things etc- wasn&#39;t worth all that much time doing the &quot;basic homework&quot; to create an alternate and productive subreddit since the 2 times I&#39;d actually done that in the past it was shut down for other reasons, so this is what I consider a small tool in my tool box- so I did not put a huge amount of time and effort at all into looking up the post history of users I told about the subreddit. </p></li>

<p>By the way, when you feel that it is counter intuitive, but at the same time you feel that you understand this subreddit, why it exists, and yet there is this strange thing in our minds that tells us, &quot;But this is CRAZY!&quot; remember there are people who put it like this: </p>

<p>reddit is not the place for the thin-skinned. it virtually crucified me a couple years ago under a previous username. </p>

<p>&quot;reaching out to people to support you&quot; is literally <em>begging</em> for this kind of scrutiny.</p>

<p>If you had properly vetted me, you would have known all of this about me and probably wouldn&#39;t have sent me a &quot;covert, secret message&quot;... because that&#39;s an instant red flag in my book. So, if the above post offended you, brace for impact... because the hard hit is yet to come. The fact that you failed to properly research someone you invited to your sub (namely me, in this instance) is <strong>YOUR FAULT</strong>, and it reflects upon the quality of your intended &quot;investigation&quot; into Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>Nice job dodging the question - it&#39;s a good thing the admins have you to valiantly defend their decisions without questioning them in <em>any</em> way.  Ya know - the same way you&#39;re dissecting and questioning every aspect of the user/sub that this post is about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You keep saying that I outed the user and the sub.</p>

<p>Because you did.  Blatantly and directly after saying you weren&#39;t going to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and the unsolicited private message which could be considered stalking of users of this subreddit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So now a single message <em>inviting</em> (not demanding) you to join a private sub counts as stalking in your opinion but <strong>this post which is public and directly calls this user and their sub out</strong> is <em>not</em> stalking?  Think about that for a second - that&#39;s just laughably bad logic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But they, themselves, were the ones who outed themselves... their identity and, by extension, the name of their sub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, right after you did in your OP.  Also, wouldn&#39;t this user&#39;s willingness to &quot;out&quot; themselves kind of go against your supposition that they&#39;re a shill/troll (which is what you seem to be suggesting with this entire post)?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is just idiotic - what are you even talking about?  I&#39;m explaining to you why I think this post is a bullshit witch hunt with no basis in logic or fact.  I am not stalking you - get over yourself.</p>

<p>no thanks. Ask your friend to post their own stupidity. In a nutshell, it went like this...</p>

<p>They invited me to their sub with all this hush-hush melodramatic secrecy. I responded very concisely. (paraphrasing, but should be very nearly an exact quote)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am now aware of your subreddit. I make no promises about what I will or will not do with that information. </p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>If they had simply left it alone there... if they had realized that maybe I really wasn&#39;t interested in their sub... we wouldn&#39;t be here today, dude.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t, and that message was (if you hadn&#39;t guessed  it) a warning about what would happen if they didn&#39;t go away and leave me alone.</p>

<p>Now, you... go away.</p>

<p><em>However,</em> you&#39;re suspicions of that particular user <em>are very misplaced.</em></p>

<p>We had this discussion in modmail, if I&#39;m not mistaken, and we agreed: I no longer trust anyone here, not even you. (Remember?)</p>

<p>While it may turn out that the person referenced above and herein is completely above reproach, that was most certainly <strong>not</strong> the entire point of my post, above.</p>

<p>Who this person is and what they do with their time is, quite frankly, none of my affair... unless they choose to involve me in it. Which they did; and, as I have repeatedly stated to someone else in this discussion, they did irresponsibly and without proper investigation.</p>

<p>&quot;Pssst. Wanna join a super duper secret subreddit?&quot; is not the way to get positive attention from me. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure Assuredly would understand why, since I revealed more about myself to him/her than I have to you. Basically it boils down to this: For the most part, I don&#39;t like &quot;secret conversations&quot;. I tried them once. It&#39;s called &quot;conspiring&quot; by most people. A few exceptions (from other PMs I&#39;ve received) include technical questions: e.g., How did you do &lt;blah&gt;? or Can you recommend a related &lt;blah blah blah&gt;? </p>

<p>But telling me a secret and then asking me to keep it for you? That&#39;s the same as asking me to be complicit in a <em>potential</em> crime. It isn&#39;t gonna happen.</p>

<p>Asking <em>me</em>? Really? I&#39;m the guy who doesn&#39;t participate in that kind of thing. </p>

<p>Just sayin.</p>

<p>The presentation here was dubious from the outset - it appeared to be a prefabricated conversation between &quot;two people&quot; (the quotes here imply something). But, yet again, all records of <em>both</em> of those accounts are now gone. Wow.</p>

<p>And yet, because <em>you say so</em>, I should just trust that this new person (who confessed to being one of the old ones)... because ... you know... your testimony is above reproach.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m wrong about them, that will become apparent in time. But, one thing is for certain... THEY CONTACTED ME. I <strong>never once</strong> expressed interest in joining a <a href="/r/SandyHookJustice">/r/SandyHookJustice</a> sub. I wasn&#39;t even a member of the first one. The only thing I&#39;ve ever even remotely hinted at in relation to that topic is that I find it intriguing (and I&#39;ve explained why in my post above - it is intriguing that it <strong>appears</strong> to have elements of conspiracy but is being &quot;shushed&quot; into a sort of &quot;fake secret underground&quot;). And the only other comment I made was recently when I asked about some documents (which I mistakenly thought were invoices, because it wasn&#39;t clear in the post what I was looking it).</p>

<p>Anyone who was actually serious about investigating something would certainly NOT have sent me a private invitation, if they had even a vague interest in actual <em>investigation</em>. </p>

<p>&quot;ooooh, this person said something in a Sandy Hook thread&quot; is NOT a reason to invite, especially when the comments in question are not supportive of your cause. </p>

<p>So, while I support their right to have their new subreddit (I&#39;m not complaining about its existence), in addition to being suspect, this discussion has now made them appear um... how did we used to describe Dubya?... oh, right... non-curious (it&#39;s codespeak for another word in this sub).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, the person who was banned for &quot;trolling&quot; by creating the SHJustice deletion post is <em>not</em> any of the users you&#39;ve mentioned.  To claim that they&#39;re the same person is just your own blind speculation and is not a valid reason for this targeted witch hunt post.  Did you even look at any of the posts on that sub before it was banned?  I assume you didn&#39;t, because if you had you probably would&#39;ve concluded that the banned user who created it wasn&#39;t suspicious at all (though you seem to have a personal vendetta against them so who knows).</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t get why the only people you seem to trust are the reddit admins who banned the sub.</p>

<p>If we&#39;re gonna put on our tinfoil hats and try to think about this from a conspiratorial yet still logical standpoint, isn&#39;t it more likely that the user who created SHJustice was getting a little &quot;too close for comfort&quot; with some of the posts in the sub, leading to the sub and user being banned, and a troll with foreknowledge of the incoming deletion/ban pre-emptively posting a thread on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> about the deletion before any real users could (knowing that the entire thread and discussion would have to be deleted once he revealed himself)?  We already know that reddit censors certain stories/topics heavily and had already banned this user previously for posting about SH - is it really so hard to imagine?</p>

<p>And why is the invitation proof of anything?  If you had a sub banned and two accounts deleted for talking about a sensitive subject, is it completely unreasonable to create a new one and make it private to prevent the same thing from happening again?</p>

<p>The only mistake that user made was inviting you and making the crazy assumption that you would be a normal human being and wouldn&#39;t go on some weird witch hunt and try to publicly shame them.  I&#39;m all for questioning everything and having an open mind but this whole post just feels &quot;off&quot; to me - you need to learn to pick your battles better.</p>

<p>This is disjointed and non-logical reasoning. At this point, you completely lost me.</p>

<p>The invitation <strong>sent to me</strong> is proof that the person in question is, at best, a very careless investigator, scooping up anything even remotely perceivable as related, without doing any vetting of their own information (I&#39;m now tired of repeating this - I was the WRONG person to invite to that sub, and it reflects on the person&#39;s credibility as an &quot;investigator&quot;...  which, by the way, you, repeatedly, keep trying to pin on me.).</p>

<p>Creating a new sub is well within their rights. They should have invited people who participated in the past, that they thought were credible participants, and left it at that. </p>

<p>Scooping up any and all people who have ever commented on a related topic.. was an act of either stupidity or attention-whoring, take your pick (my post is allowing the public to do likewise).</p>

<p>You have now lost all credibility with me from this constant badgering of unrelated trivialities. It&#39;s apparent, by now, that you are playing footsie with one another... are you husband/wife or bf/gf? One of you playing damsel in distress while the other plays knight in shining armor? </p>

<p>It&#39;s actually fairly simple - can you explain which part you&#39;re confused by?  That user had two of their accounts and one subreddit banned for talking about Sandy Hook.  Are you with me so far?  Okay, so being that they had two accounts and a subreddit banned, they probably thought, &quot;Maybe the next one I make should be private so that I don&#39;t get my account and subreddit banned again.&quot;  This really is pretty simple logic my dude.</p>

<p>Okay?  So they&#39;re a careless investigator, they didn&#39;t properly &quot;vet&quot; you.  What&#39;s your point?</p>

<p>It was a terrible mistake to think that you could be a &quot;credible participant&quot;.  That much is now clear.</p>

<p>Or it was trying to gather like minded people to discuss a subject who have shown an interest in that subject in the past.  No need to start throwing insults around.</p>

<p>You&#39;re sounding more and more defensive and accusatory as we go.  Maybe you should make a new post where you accuse me of being a troll/shill as well?  That seems to be your M.O.  To answer your question, though, no I&#39;ve never met that user before outside of reddit.</p>

<p>Already addressed this (thanks again, KK). </p>

<p>This is my last comment to you. It&#39;s quite clear that you are here attacking me (whether you came here for that purpose or not is irrelevant). You are attacking me. Period. You claim (elsewhere) to be defending, but you are, <strong>in fact</strong> (that means the <em>facts</em> here indicate), otherwise.

<p>ambiversive was selected to be the first new &quot;active&quot; mod (all the others, illuminatedwax and donbueno and the like, were terminally inactive). ambiversive went on a &quot;decorating spree&quot; (tweaking the UI with passion-purple and esoteric symbols and other silly crap). The users tarred-and-feathered him and ran him out of the sub on a rail (so to speak).</p>

<p>Eventually, ambiversive &quot;committed suicide&quot; ... <strong>twice</strong>... <em>months apart</em>.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of ambiversive&#39;s removal (see: <a href="http://redd.it/o42jr">http://redd.it/o42jr</a>), several new mods were selected (partially elected) (see: <a href="http://redd.it/ok48g">http://redd.it/ok48g</a>).</p>

<p>All opposing viewpoints (in those new selections) eventually killed each other off, with only a few exceptions. One was MrDong (the UFO/alien/cropcircle/tabloidgossip guy who deleted his account and we have no real proof that the new one, Mr_Dong, is the same guy). And, two who were semi-active participants in <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>.: Sarah_Conner (I think you may still be able to dig far enough back in this account&#39;s comments to find some of that participation - which has, in recent months due to controversy, stopped) and 9000sins (who implemented an automated tool to remove all of his comments and posts after X-days/hours - and who was shadowbanned for posting kiddie porn ... an &quot;honest mistake&quot;, I&#39;m sure). </p>

<p>One of 9000sins last active orders of business (around the time donbueno came out of his coma and fired everyone when he saw what 9000sins had done to this place - and &quot;illuminatedwax&quot; fired donbueno and re-hired everyone) was the hiring of Flytape - someone eager to ban (perpetuating the heavy-handed banning started by 9000sins). </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong here. I think some people probably <em>should</em> be banned, but it shouldn&#39;t be those who disagree with the mods... or those who speak loudly. Stalkers? Yeah, if it can be proven. Proven shills? Keyword &quot;proven&quot;, you bet. Long-term, habitual trolls (ala <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>)? I think a significantly provable history of behavior could be a valid reason for a ban.</p>

<p>But, 9000sins was banning people who objected to <em>him</em>, and handed <em>that</em> over to Flytape, who perpetuated it (I&#39;ve since had many discussions with Assuredly and Flytape about this issue - I hope Flytape is now realizing my point about this.)</p>

<p>Do I &quot;trust&quot; any of the current mods? (This is a trick question, right?)</p>

<p>I disagree, to a limited degree. </p>

<p>I can hold decent conversations with people who want to hold such conversations. </p>

<p>I can also recognize troublesome behavior for what it is (we have a link in the sidebar to The Gentleperson&#39;s Guide To Forum Spies which should be required reading for all here).</p>

<p>It was a couple guys who constantly raised the cries of &quot;anti-semitism&quot; in every thread they could find on reddit (and elsewhere? not sure, but reddit was a primary target). Some of their argumentation was that Jews are genetically superior to non-Jews.

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s the deal with the shillhunting/drama?</p>

<p>What is the worst a shill is going to do?:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Post disinformation (water down/confuse the issue)</p></li>
<li><p>post and upvote racist (always about jews, because JIDF) topics</p></li>
<li><p>argue a point</p></li>
<li><p>brigade to keep posts/comments from getting traction.</p></li>
<li><p>post honeypots  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Half the time &quot;shills&quot; are just people who disagree with an opinion.  Otherwise there are some very real groups and individuals working diligently on here (some paid, some not) to support an agenda.</p>

<p>As long as there is some modicum of moderation to keep shills from destroying popular subs, it&#39;s the users&#39; responsibility to sift through the bullshit and discern what is worth spending time on.  Unless someone is very clearly advocating something questionable- I think it would behoove everyone to refrain from the namecalling.  If <a href="/u/newtruth221">/u/newtruth221</a> is actually doxxing the folks in Sandy Hook- there might be an issue, but otherwise it doesn&#39;t sound like he&#39;s doing anything harmful. </p>

<p>Is there any more information or topics I can read with history on this? It sounds intruiging.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When it was decided that this sub needed moderation, here&#39;s how things transpired (not sure how much of this was planned or pre-orchestrated).</p>

<p>One account was sacrificed: <a href="/u/ambiversive">/u/ambiversive</a></p>

<p>ambiversive was selected to be the first new &quot;active&quot; mod (all the others, illuminatedwax and donbueno and the like, were terminally inactive). ambiversive went on a &quot;decorating spree&quot; (tweaking the UI with passion-purple and esoteric symbols and other silly crap). The users tarred-and-feathered him and ran him out of the sub on a rail (so to speak).</p>

<p>Eventually, ambiversive &quot;committed suicide&quot; ... <strong>twice</strong>... <em>months apart</em>.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of ambiversive&#39;s removal (see: <a href="http://redd.it/o42jr">http://redd.it/o42jr</a>), several new mods were selected (partially elected) (see: <a href="http://redd.it/ok48g">http://redd.it/ok48g</a>).</p>

<p>All opposing viewpoints (in those new selections) eventually killed each other off, with only a few exceptions. One was MrDong (the UFO/alien/cropcircle/tabloidgossip guy who deleted his account and we have no real proof that the new one, Mr_Dong, is the same guy). And, two who were semi-active participants in <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>.: Sarah_Conner (I think you may still be able to dig far enough back in this account&#39;s comments to find some of that participation - which has, in recent months due to controversy, stopped) and 9000sins (who implemented an automated tool to remove all of his comments and posts after X-days/hours - and who was shadowbanned for posting kiddie porn ... an &quot;honest mistake&quot;, I&#39;m sure). </p>

<p>One of 9000sins last active orders of business (around the time donbueno came out of his coma and fired everyone when he saw what 9000sins had done to this place - and &quot;illuminatedwax&quot; fired donbueno and re-hired everyone) was the hiring of Flytape - someone eager to ban (perpetuating the heavy-handed banning started by 9000sins). </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong here. I think some people probably <em>should</em> be banned, but it shouldn&#39;t be those who disagree with the mods... or those who speak loudly. Stalkers? Yeah, if it can be proven. Proven shills? Keyword &quot;proven&quot;, you bet. Long-term, habitual trolls (ala <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>)? I think a significantly provable history of behavior could be a valid reason for a ban.</p>

<p>But, 9000sins was banning people who objected to <em>him</em>, and handed <em>that</em> over to Flytape, who perpetuated it (I&#39;ve since had many discussions with Assuredly and Flytape about this issue - I hope Flytape is now realizing my point about this.)</p>

<p>Do I &quot;trust&quot; any of the current mods? (This is a trick question, right?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not much of conspiracy theorist, not so much I don&#39;t believe that there &quot;are more things under heaven and earth Horatio than are dreamt of in your philosopy&quot; as simply because I don&#39;t like people trying to convince me what I should be thinking.</p>

<p>A lot of conspiracy is as full of hearsay as anything &quot;mainstream&quot;, imo.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that&#39;s very arguable. My point is only that when we start to dismiss too much of what we read as being compromised, then those who hope for the success of social engineering will have won the war, and the little skirmishes here and there that survive and seem interesting will just be entertainment to keep idle minds amused.</p>

<p>Accept that it&#39;s all compromised: continue to read and listen and make your own connections.  There is very likely more than a single truth out there: find the voices that ring true and make sense to you most of the time.  Staying skeptical is healthy, but it&#39;s a far cry from being dismissive.</p>
