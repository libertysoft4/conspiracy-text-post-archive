        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a speculative series of assumptions which, together, create a coherent theory (ie it fits with the known facts). </p>

<p>Assumption 1: US intelligence gets a tip-off that one (or more) of the 20 Freescale employees on the flight to Beijing was planning to turn over classified data (or equipment) to the Chinese military on arrival.</p>

<p>Assumption 2: The highly sensitive nature of the technology involved means that US intelligence decides the flight must not reach Beijing, whatever happens. However, there is no obvious way to intervene politically to stop a Malaysian Airlines flight betwee KL and Beijing, and shooting the plane out of the sky would basically start WW3, because of the number of Chinese nationals on board.</p>

<p>Assumption 3: US intelligence, with Boeing&#39;s assistance, takes direct control of the Boeing 777-200ER, and disables all onboard flight controls. This makes pilots completely redundant (like Michael Hasting clearly was) - there is nothing they can do to change the course or altitude of the plane and the transponder and radio is disabled - they are as helpless as the passengers on board. </p>

<p>Assumption 4: Inmarsat, the UK satellite company which provided on-board wifi may be complicit at this point, because there were no (reports of) outgoing calls from MH370 after this point, which is very strange. Ordinary cell phones don&#39;t work at altitude (despite the media stories of cell phone calls made from flight 93 on 9/11).</p>

<p>Assumption 5: MH370 is made to change course and fly back towards the Andaman sea. As it moves over the Indian Ocean, it is out of range of all civil and military radar, and the controllers take it on a path  towards the Maldives, and then the US military base on the island of Diego Garcia. </p>

<p>At this point, the US may have landed the airplane at Diego Garcia. How the &quot;239 loose ends&quot; were tied up, I leave to your imagination. </p>

<p>Alternatively, the flight may have taken a path South, giving both the US and Australia plausible deniability (&quot;it was out radar range&quot;). Eventually the flight would run out of fuel and crash into the ocean, taking all evidence to the sea floor.</p>

<p>If the US government is willing to kill to keep this info from getting out then the Chinese already knew what was on that plane and they would be pissed that America is getting/has gotten away with it. This also means we would see more arguing over who gets to search for the plane. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All fair comments, but none of them armour-piercing. The nationality of the Freescale employees is only of interest insofar as there have been many instances of Chinese nationals infiltrating Western organisations and stealing secrets.</p>

<p>There are other ways of moving information around than bits and bytes (paper, hardware, human brains!).</p>

<p>The Chinese may suspect that the Americans are behind this, but they will struggle to prove it, and would have to admit to military espionage, and the loss of face that entails.</p>

<p>The public debate over where to search for the missing plane is a grotesque farce. Certain parties know exactly where that plane is, and they are using misdirection techniques to ensure that the search happens elsewhere.</p>

<p>From my understanding, if the plane is overtaken by remote control, the pilot has the ability to override that and regain manual control of the plane.  I am not an expert so I don&#39;t know for sure if that is true, but from what I have read that is my understanding.  If that is true then it would be impossible for someone to remotely fly the plane if the pilot wanted to regain control.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This may be the &quot;official position&quot;, but I suspect the truth is quite different. One of the principal reasons for having the technology to remotely control a passenger plane is to be able to over-ride a rogue pilot or a hijacker. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be correct, I honestly don&#39;t know.  I read a few different places that there are actual cables that go from the pilot&#39;s joystick to the control surfaces of the airplane and that is how they can override the fly-by-wire system but I don&#39;t know that for a fact.  I always thought the remote control feature was to safely land a plane that had a situation where the pilot was incapacitated, such as a heart attack or something like that.  We would need the input of a 777 flight mechanic or engineer to know for sure I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every fly-by-wire system has multiple redundancies, one of which is mechanical by nature. </p>

<p>Secondly, the flight control systems have multiple redundancies built in to the electronics to ensure proper operation. </p>

<p>Third, I don&#39;t think remote control technology is built into every plane, and I highly doubt it&#39;s built into any passenger aircraft. That would be a huge security problem. </p>

<p>4th point: I don&#39;t even think remote/unmanned pilot technology even exists for planes that large. </p>

<p>According to this^ article, the plane was under GRU-surveillance (russian intelligence) because of a &#39;suspicious cargo&#39; which they assume is linked to the 2 dead soldiers on the Maersk Alabama last month.  </p>

<p>Also, on the day when the plane disappeared, there were no flights planned on Diego Garcia (usually there are 2-3 each day , check the &quot;Diego garcia passenger terminal&quot; on facebook)</p>

<p>Also the pilot allegdly had diego garcia as programmed in Flight Simulator, but deleted it a month before.</p>

<p>Last but not least, the very first threads on 4chans /pol/ that linked boeiing 777 with Diego Garcia were &#39;magically deleted&#39; ; Also other internet articles on newswebsites about Diego Garcia were deleted (there was an article on RT about it, but it is gone)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only part I wasn&#39;t aware of was the bit about there being no flight bookings for Diego Garcia on that day. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve posted previously on this, and I do think Diego Garcia is pivotal in this story. It is inconceivable to me that the US, with its satellites and other technology on Diego Garcia doesn&#39;t know what has happened to the missing flight. Their silence on the matter is pretty damning.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I think the sightings of MH370 in the Maldives are credible. Although why the plane would have flown over the Maldives on its way to Diego Garcia isn&#39;t clear to me. It would perhaps make sense if the pilot was in control and was &quot;feeling his way&quot; towards DG just using a compass?</p>

<p>Even assuming that your statement was correct, there is no way that you could &quot;know&quot; this for a fact, is there?</p>

<p>It is etremely likely that Freescale has research data that competitors and rival nations would be interested in acquiring. </p>
