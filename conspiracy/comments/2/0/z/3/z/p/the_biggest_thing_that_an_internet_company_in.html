The reason this matters, If you look at a copy of 1984 on Amazon, the NSA can see a record of that, the Russians, the French can --- the world’s library is unencrypted. This is something that we need to change, not just for Amazon --- all companies need to move to an encrypted browsing habit by default.”</p>

<p>=== === ===</p>

<p>This is what Edward Snowden says at minute 9:20 of his TED talk.</p>

<p>Now, the reason it&#39;s a conspiracy:</p>

<ul>
<li> <strong><em>WHY is the audio of him saying that INTENTIONALLY GARBLED at 9:28 in the TED video?</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>=== === ===</p>

<p>My main point, which I may have failed to make to no_game_player&#39;s satisfaction, is a wacky observation, that the NSA already has backdoors built in to cracking any packets with SSL encryption, but that the latest TLS encryption may be much harder for them to crack, and so, to discourage American companies from all switching over to TLS 2.4 today, they somehow intentionally garbled that second of Edward Snowden&#39;s speech.  Like censors of five-second-delay live television with their finger on the cussword BLEEPer.  Either at the TED level, or at the VPN level.</p>

<p>C&#39;mon, man, have some fun with it!  It&#39;s a <strong><em>conspiracy</em></strong> !</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s a very interesting question. Basically, it&#39;s much more difficult to answer the question that way around. You see, it&#39;s relatively easy to be able to pick apart a given piece of encryption and find the weaknesses that could be used to break it (at least in theory by an organization with sufficient resources, etc).</p>

<p>But it&#39;s much more difficult to be able to say &#39;this <em>can&#39;t</em> be broken&#39;. It&#39;s more like you can have &#39;we don&#39;t know any ways this can be broken&#39; versus &#39;we know a few ways that can be broken&#39;.</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s somewhat like security in general: it&#39;s rather difficult to impossible to guarantee someone can&#39;t break into your house; instead, you make a reasonable deterrent.</p>

<p>It might sound like, then, well why not use SSL or TLS and it&#39;ll slow them down. But they&#39;re so heavily broken it&#39;s really not even a roadbump in my opinion. One of the major weaknesses that doesn&#39;t get mentioned in a lot of the more formal and &#39;direct&#39; analyses of those systems is the signing chain. Essentially, it would be trivial and is known possible for the NSA to just have &#39;forged&#39; keys, thus bypassing all of the rest of the logic of that encryption system.</p>

<p>SO...is there anything? Well...if you&#39;re just looking at mathematical models, similarly, there are ones we know &#39;yep, they can break that&#39;, and ones with &#39;nothing known yet&#39;. So I could mention mathematical classifications of some of them.</p>

<p>The problem with that is that they aren&#39;t generally in common use, because most people aren&#39;t paranoid enough for them. And just because you know a better encryption algorithm doesn&#39;t get you very far: in fact, many of the weaknesses in actual encryption systems comes not from the formal mathematical model for it, but in some weakness of the implementation itself.</p>

<p>So if you want a secure cryptosystem, it&#39;s necessary to get <em>everything</em> right, while if they want to break it, it&#39;s only necessary for the smallest chink in one step of the logic.</p>

<p>In reality, I basically consider the NSA as the &#39;ultimate adversary&#39; for this sort of thing as a result. They make a great &#39;foil&#39; for analyzing systems, because a lot of the things people otherwise wave off as impossible they can be assumed capable of doing, thus requiring higher standards.</p>

<p>What will stop them? First, asking that question. Second, learning very advanced number theory (the basis of all cryptography). Third, building and developing large amounts of cryptosystems according to all best practices and accounting for all known vectors of attack at all levels. It is making security a basic habit, rather than the afterthought it almost always is now.</p>

<p>Alternately, just starve the beast by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/LessCredibleDefence/comments/20z7nu/why_does_the_nsa_want_to_keep_its_water_usage_a/">cutting off their water</a>. Honestly, it might be easier at this point, lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I think there are people that is working on that idea of cutting off their water supply. I for one will find that highly doubtful it will work. I did see some reports about Apple and their iPhone - iOS7 had a SSL vulnerability (<a href="http://www.idownloadblog.com/2014/02/24/ssl-bug-fuels-nsa-theories/">http://www.idownloadblog.com/2014/02/24/ssl-bug-fuels-nsa-theories/</a>). It looked like this occurred since iOS6. The SSL wasnt the problem, but how it was implemented - somebody can bypass the SSL/TLS verification. So it looks like having SSL and TLS is still good for now. I will definitely be keeping my eye out for new security measures thats proven to work, but for now I will stick with OpenSSL and get that working on my site.</p>

<p>This is incorrect. Pointing out one vulnerability in implementation doesn&#39;t change the other weaknesses in design. Did you bother reading what I wrote? Did you understand the problem with the signing chains? That is just one systemic flaw that destroys the validity of those systems vs NSA entirely.</p>

<p>OpenSSL is fine for protecting credit cards or making sure that you can use wireless without someone sniffing your passwords or whatever. It isn&#39;t going to do shit to stop the NSA, for a lot of reasons.</p>

<p>Your post shares the same unprofessional, non-technical elementary mistake that OP has of acting like all encryption is interchangeable. This kills the encryption...</p>

<p>Acting like the question is &quot;encryption&quot; vs &quot;not encryption&quot; misses the point entirely. And you and OP help to further the ignorance of the general population by acting like &quot;encryption on&quot; is magic sauce.

<p>WHY is the audio of him saying that INTENTIONALLY GARBLED at 9:28 in the TED video?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>classic youtube &quot;glitch&quot; censorship at its finest...</p>

<p>go rewatch any of the great esoteric, occult, truth videos on youtube and you can bet the sound will be out of sync in certain places (or the whole video) frames skip and jump, parts are missing, key audio segments are garbled or it is all garbled and on and on.</p>

<p>they have it down to an art form.</p>

<p>just like <em>they</em> insert typo&#39;s into particularly powerful or emotive/informative posts on forums all across the web to detune its impact and make the readers view the poster as flawed</p>
