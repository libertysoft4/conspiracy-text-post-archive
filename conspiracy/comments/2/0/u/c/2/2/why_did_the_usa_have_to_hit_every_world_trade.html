<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century#.22New_Pearl_Harbor.22"><strong>&quot;New Pearl Harbor&quot;</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Section V of Rebuilding America&#39;s Defenses, entitled &quot;Creating Tomorrow&#39;s Dominant Force&quot;, includes the sentence: &quot;Further, <strong>the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event––like a new Pearl Harbor&quot;</strong> (51).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sensible people have a natural aversion to actions that they find morally repugnant <strong>and/or</strong> contrary to to their self-interests.</p>

<p>For the most part, the people of the US wanted no part in WWII. Pearl Harbor changed that.</p>

<p>Similarly, the people of the US had little interest in spending billions and killing countless thousands in taking out Saddam (Israel&#39;s enemy). 9-11 (spiced with vicious lies) changed THAT.</p>

<p>BONUS: with the latter, people of the US happily surrendered rights that they would have otherwise fought to retain.</p>

EDIT II: Clarified verbiage. </p>

<p>Yes, flight 93 was headed in the <strong>general direction</strong> of DC, but it was over 100 miles away - and even if DC were the intended destination, there are dozens of targets that could have been hit - such as the US Capitol, etc.</p>

<p>No, but billing Georgie Dubya&#39;s <em>Home-Sweet-Home</em> as a target helped to generate public support for anything he told us we MUST DO to stop the TERR&#39;RISTS!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a hard time &quot;imagining&quot; the entire scenario, frankly.</p>

<p>Apparently these rag-headed &quot;geniuses&quot; in Afghanistan caves were BRILLIANT enough to cook up a plot where they could get four <strong>grade F</strong> &quot;pilots&quot; trained in single engine Cessna&#39;s to fly multi-engined airliners through virtually impossible maneuvers at CRUISING SPEED and precisely hit their targets in a way that would bring down not one, not <em>two</em> but THREE steel-framed high-rise skyscrapers - AND penetrate the all three rings of the reinforced concrete structure of one of the most highly secured buildings on the planet...</p>

<p>BUT these &quot;cave geniuses&quot; were too damn stupid to realize what would happen next?</p>

<p>What did they THINK would happen? That the US would surrender to Bin Laden? That we&#39;d all abandon our bikinis, grow beards and prostrate ourselves facing Mecca for daily prayers?</p>

<p>If you believe that these Megabrained Muslim Maniac Martyrs were &quot;smart&quot; enough to plan &quot;the job&quot; and pull it off, why do you believe that they were too ST00PID to realize that the wrath of the whole Western world would rain HELL (and depleted uranium) on the heads of they and their fellows for years or decades to follow?</p>

<p>The FIRST question you need to ask when something like this comes up is WHO BENEFITS?</p>

<p>Who DID ultimately benefit from 9-11, xXxConsole_KillerxXx? </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t Osama and friends, that&#39;s for damn sure.</p>
