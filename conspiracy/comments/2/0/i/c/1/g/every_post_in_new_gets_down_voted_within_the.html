<p>The water fluoridation shit that&#39;s been around here lately has been pretty bad, also. I mean, what better way to make a group seem totally crazy then to start talking about your precious bodily fluids. Case in point for your argument.</p>

<p>I try to always downvote when someone accuses another of being a shill though. There is no way anyone knows that, so the accusation is useless and unhelpful to any discussion. Conspiritard does downvote brigade occasionally, but only for certain threads and even then they do tell their people not to do it.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t invoke Dr. Strangelove, one of my all-time favorite movies. Kubrick is a film god, not god himself.</p>

<p>The most convincing evidence to me that there is some sort of conspiracy is that A) there&#39;s no proof fluoridation has any significant benefit yet we still do it and B) people who don&#39;t want fluoride in their water are ridiculed and called crazy for some reason.</p>

<p>The connections between Flouride and the Pineal Gland, &quot;the third eye&quot; and holy experiences, DMT and human access to divine truth, gives me my suspicions about the motives behind such a conspiracy. </p>

<p>The mass medication of fluoride that is forced on everyone through their public water supply is highly dangerous.  If fluoride is so necessary, it should he properly dosed and provided by a pharmacy to be topically applied.  Fluoride has zero positive effects when consumed.  Zero.  It&#39;s actually quite harmful when consumed in water.  Those millisecond contacts with your teeth do absolutely no good.</p>

<p>Remove fluoride from your diet.  It&#39;s challenging, but highly worth it for your health.  Purchasing distilled water is quite easy.  And isn&#39;t terribly expensive when done in bulk through a water delivery service.  10-25 dollars per month.</p>

<p>Reading my posting history? Don&#39;t worry I&#39;m no shill, just disagree a lot on this site.</p>

<p>I ridicule them because I have found no actual science that the levels of fluoride that are added to many water sources is harmful in any way. Too many of the anti-fluoridation people cite bad science or find one sentence in a real peer reviewed study that agrees with their viewpoint, even if the actual paper disagrees with them.</p>

<p>There is certainly a case that it just isn&#39;t needed anymore, but beyond that there is clear science that it was at one point and possibly is still is.</p>

<p>And no I do not intend to continue this argument. You disagree with me, I disagree with you. And I seriously doubt any evidence I link will change your mind. And I can promise that any thing you link will not change my mind, <em>unless</em> it is a peer reviewed study that shows that the levels of fluoride in our water is dangerous. Not levels in areas with very high natural fluoride like that China study that a lot of anti-fluoridation people like to cite.</p>

<p>Tl;Dr There is no point in continuing this argument. Enjoy your night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they definitely deserve to be there.  So you and your goons can take consensus against the tide of truth.  How many people support the forced medication of their water, with doses based ONLY on how much water one consumes, how long they spend in the shower, and how large they are? It&#39;s not many.  </p>

<p>This is why you need to bring all of your lower friends into the conversation to take widespread belief.  The people know that fluoridation of their water supply is wrong.  We are now actively fighting it across the globe.</p>
