<p>Jesus H Christ, I did not imagine that Americans are THIS dumb.  Psychotropic &quot;medication&quot; means irreversible changes to the brain; something which has not been researched.</p>

<p>Hell, psychology is basically a con job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.</p>

<p>It is in the (financial, career, wealth) interest of the doctors/psychologists to increase what is deemed psychotic or mental disorder.</p>

<p>As to studies:</p>

<p>American Psychological Association web page:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/nov06/medicate.aspx">http://www.apa.org/monitor/nov06/medicate.aspx</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of the studies of psychotropic medication, including research intended to guide prescribing to children, have been done with adults, notes Brown, who is also a public health professor and dean at Temple University.</p>

<p>&quot;Clearly the use [of medication] far exceeds any data,&quot; comments Brown. Evidence supports psychosocial interventions such as exposure and response therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, multisystemic therapy and habit reversal training--alone or in addition to medication--for several disorders, he adds. The working group calls for a greater emphasis on treatment supported by scientific evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good. That&#39;s why you have the best students, and one of the most productive populations in the world. I can&#39;t even get fucking Vyvanse in the EUSSR. Everything causes irreversible changes to the brain - that also includes not using the medication for extended periods. That also includes being a jobless slob because of low attention span. That&#39;s how neuroplasticity works.</p>

<p>Amphetamines shouldn&#39;t even be prescribed. Everyone should just be free to better themselves. It would be an amazing step towards transhumanism.</p>

Cottage cheese? Bread? Aspirin? Are you trying to insult my intelligence, or are you REALLY this stupid?</p>

<li><p>You can&#39;t conflate pharma companies getting the definition of medical problems changed with the idea that schools with suddenly change their policies about parental consent to medication by the staff. It&#39;s a <em>huge</em> stretch and you&#39;re skipping the whole legal issue about how the school has an obligation to follow the board of educations directions and the people on the board of directors for the school follow the instructions of the department of education (who get policed by the Minister of Education, who is appointed by the party in power [or however it works in your country]) and all those people <em>have kids</em> of their own whom they would want to keep power over while they go to school. You&#39;re being <strong>obtentionally intuse</strong> by making it seem like one happening leads to the other without telling us how, and expecting us to agree with you cause you&#39;re afraid.</p></li>
<li><p>Take an active interest in your childs school. Maybe tell them you&#39;ve got this concern and they&#39;ll work with you to show you how it won&#39;t be happening; Maybe they&#39;ll detail the procedure that would have to take place before forcefully drugging pupils in the institute. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now as for this show maybe you got a name or a keyword to search? A name, either of the episode or someone who talks about it on the show. </p>

<p><strong>Regoluatory Capture</strong> is a real thing, it happens and should be resisted. However scaremongering tactics about drugs being forcefed to children aren&#39;t going to help. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, a special. They run these reports on various topics, say, a situation in a country with reporters on site. Something that American &quot;news&quot; does not do...</p>

<p>Sure I can.  IMO that day is not far off - the zombifying of our children, for their own good, of course.</p>

<p>Absolutely.  That goes without saying.</p>
