    <div class="md"><p>The daily mail, not the best of sources but it is what it is, reported:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Astronomers are expected to announce they have found &#39;primordial gravitational waves&#39; - an echo of the big bang in which the universe came into existence 14bn years ago.</p>

<p>Described as &#39;like a message from the dawn of time&#39;, if confirmed it  it would be a groundbreaking discovery that would change the face of physics and give scientists their first glimpse of how the universe was born.</p>

<p>Gravitational waves, the last untested prediction of Albert Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity,  are minuscule ripples in the fabric of the universe that carry energy across space - rather like the waves than travel across an ocean.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The team of scientists have only said they will unveil a &#39;major discovery&#39; in the field of astrophysics on Monday (March 17) in a presentation at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most stuff on the electric universe theory I&#39;ve seen don&#39;t say that gravity doesn&#39;t exist or play a part in the universe, just that the influence of electromagnetism might be stronger than expected. They&#39;re usually also quick to say that the research needs to be done before it&#39;s developed into a proper theory.</p>

<p>But meh, if a flawed theory needs to die to accommodate the truth, no biggie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think gravity waves specifically go against EU theory because it is tied in with the theory of relativity.  Which I think is at odds with the EU theory.<br/>
Talking about the smaller scale like star formation, I think the EU theory is pretty solid and getting better everyday. </p>

<p>but when talking about redshift and the big bang, EU is getting weaker.</p>

<p>Either way, go science! </p>

Whether that is what was discovered or not is another matter, but it&#39;s what is expected that it is. That article also has a link to a Guardian article about it as well. Sounds like the researchers involved can expect a Nobel Prize out of it, should be pretty exciting. </p>

There is a lot of work into this, it would be hard to imagine someone doing all this if it weren&#39;t going to go anywhere. You can supposedly do an experiment with a plastic bottle.
