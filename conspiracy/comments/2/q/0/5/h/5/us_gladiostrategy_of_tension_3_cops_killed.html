        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>U.S. crime is at a 40-year low, yet police deaths are skyrocketing in <strong>single-incident mass-shootings</strong>:</p>

<p>This is extremely unlikely.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to suggest that during the two years prior to OWS, some key U.S. cities were subjected to an &quot;Operation Gladio&quot; paradigm, the same U.S. cities where cops are now exercising violent crackdowns.</p>

<p>Some interesting statistics juxtaposed with the 2009-2010 Gladio examples:</p>

<p>Crime in 2010 dropped to its lowest rate since 1967 in Los Angeles, Seattle, and St. Louis, as well as its lowest level in many years elsewhere:  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3plxbpt">http://tinyurl.com/3plxbpt</a></p>

<p>Crime from 2009-2013 is plummeting, according to the FBI:  <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2014/november/crime-statistics-for-2013-released/crime-statistics-for-2013-released">http://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2014/november/crime-statistics-for-2013-released/crime-statistics-for-2013-released</a></p>

<p>However, police deaths in 2010 jumped nearly 40%:  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/28/police-deaths-2010_n_801901.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/28/police-deaths-2010_n_801901.html</a></p>

<p>Moreover, many of these police deaths occurred in &quot;single-massacre incidents&quot;:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>4 killed in Oakland:  <a href="http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-03-23/bay-area/17215878_1_parole-officer-officers-families-swat-team">http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-03-23/bay-area/17215878_1_parole-officer-officers-families-swat-team</a></p></li>
<li><p>4 killed in Seattle:  <a href="http://www.komonews.com/news/local/78088192.html">http://www.komonews.com/news/local/78088192.html</a></p></li>
<li><p>4 killed in Detroit:  <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20110123/NEWS05/110123016/Four-police-shot-Detroit-precinct-gunman-killed">http://www.freep.com/article/20110123/NEWS05/110123016/Four-police-shot-Detroit-precinct-gunman-killed</a></p></li>
<li><p>3 killed in Pittsburgh:  <a href="http://www.wtae.com/news/19094064/detail.html">http://www.wtae.com/news/19094064/detail.html</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Since 2009, has there been a &quot;localized&quot; U.S. version of Gladio, with cops as the &quot;target audience&quot; instead of a general populace terrorized (as in Italy during the 1970s)?  </p>

<p>With cops, instead, as the &quot;stimulus generalization&quot; audience, <strong>intended to divide cops against communities they serve?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Isn&#39;t it fairly unusual for a single-incident &quot;police massacre&quot; -- let alone so many, during 2009-2010, which were simultaneously &quot;Lowest Crime Rate&quot; years?</strong></p>

<p>U.S. cops have been in a siege mentality since 2009, especially in Oakland, Seattle, Detroit, Pittsburgh and a few other cities (officers killed in Fort Worth, Dallas, Anchorage, and elsewhere).</p>

<p>How can the police see themselves in the face of a U.S. citizen, if they are artificially under siege, being assassinated, <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2014/november/crime-statistics-for-2013-released/crime-statistics-for-2013-released">despite crime rates dropping</a>?</p>

<p>How many coincidences have to pile up?</p>

<p><strong>In October 2011, when Occupy Wall Street &amp; the Occupy Movement began, the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;site=&amp;source=hp&amp;q=Occupy+Wall+Street+sniper&amp;oq=Occupy+Wall+Street+sniper&amp;gs_l=hp.3..0i22i30l2.1266.6060.0.6436.26.15.0.11.11.0.128.1348.9j5.14.0.msedr...0...1c.1.60.hp..2.24.1326.0.NZjreT35qnE">FBI had plans</a> to control Occupy with snipers:</strong>  <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/03/18/fbi-ordered-to-justify-shielding-of-records-sought-about-alleged-occupy-sniper-plot/">http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/03/18/fbi-ordered-to-justify-shielding-of-records-sought-about-alleged-occupy-sniper-plot/</a></p>

<p><strong>In October 2011, a woman was shot in downtown Seattle (at the height of the Occupy Movement) by a &quot;mystery sniper&quot;:</strong>  <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2016659376_shooting01m.html#_ga=1.132995470.1698641475.1404457339">http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2016659376_shooting01m.html#_ga=1.132995470.1698641475.1404457339</a></p>

<p>We can see that U.S. intelligence services are more than willing to create secret programs to stimulate chaos.</p>

<p>We have acknowledgement from the FBI itself that &quot;agent provocateurs&quot; have been used extensively in the past:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Seattle COINTELPRO Division will closely follow this development and will attempt to create disruptive and diversionary activities within any of these New Left groups</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are there rogue JSOC individuals within U.S. intelligence services trying to hyperstimulate local U.S. police departments?  To divide and conquer ... by dividing the police against the citizens?</p>

<p>In 2003-2004 during the Iraq occupation, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/07/international/middleeast/07ASSA.html?ex=1391490000&amp;amp;en=1d4f662cec46b775&amp;amp;ei=5007&amp;amp;partner=USERLAND">assassinations of judges, doctors, lawyers, police swept Iraq</a> -- anyone who could help create a functioning democracy was assassinated.</p>

<p>This mystery phenomenon was never named or solved -- but it parallels the CIA&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Program">Phoenix Program in Vietnam</a> and later Latin America&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Condor">Operation Condor</a>.</p>

<p>Is the Phoenix Program a common CIA model for manipulation of societies?</p>

<p>The manipulation of cops is not exactly the same as the examples above.</p>

<p>Phoenix/Condor were intended to decapitate society&#39;s leadership.  (Breivik might be an example of that as well).</p>

<p>But the manipulation of police is shaping the parameters of society.</p>

<p><a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2025279467_militarizedpolice1xml.html">While simultaneously militarizing U.S. police with military surplus hardware?</a></p>

<p>It seems that these ingredients (manipulation of cops + militarization of cops) are two ingredients that cannot be ignored as coincidental when we see them together in a recipe.</p>

<p>What is the recipe?  What are they baking for us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My sister recently went through an EMT coarse. Everyone was encouraged not to divulge personal information. What they did, why they were there and what their goals were etc. Those that passed through the coarse had a graduation ceremony of sorts where they shared the withheld information. Keep in mind the coarse was during the ebola scare, the changing of EMT protocols related, and the Mike Brown murder. During the graduation a lot came out. One was that many of the students were police officers. She was amazed at how they truly believe their is a conspiracy to racially divide the nation and divide the police and citizens of this nation. Most were outraged at military equipment being used in their precincts and the current events leading up to such warranted use of such. Most were very serious about the constitution and how to uphold it. And one of her instructors was a firefighter in the WTC during the collapse. That instructor had a lot to share in viewpoints on the subject. It seemed to her that that instructor chose the teaching position to reveal first hand knowledge of what happened. It was eye opening to say the least. IMO yes, there seems to be a powerful agenda to divide the country and world in many aspects. Be it racial, religious, lifestyle choice, political, us vs. them, police vs. citizen, etc. And many are very passionate on the issues, and it seems to lead them to downvote or discard any other viewpoint than their perceived belief. I am a true believer in finding common denominators in all aspects and beliefs. Balance and compassion. Even if I&#39;m passionate about something, I&#39;m still willing to look at all angles of a subject. You bring up a lot of good points in your post. I appreciate it. And hopefully people will dive deep into similar questions while allowing their passionate beliefs to be the observer rather than the impulsive reaction. Edit a word. </p>

<p>I literally just got off the phone with the sheriff, who just got off the phone with someone at the state fusion center.</p>

<p>I now have to be at the fusion center at 0630 tomorrow morning for an emergency meeting where we&#39;ll be going through the threats against agencies and officers that have come in via social media since the assassinations of the NYPD officers.</p>

<p><strong>There are apparently so many that we&#39;re going to have to take a divide and conquer approach.</strong></p>

<p>Guys and girls, be safe. Watch your MDTs and email for threat alerts. They&#39;re apparently coming in faster than they can be cleared.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This seems sensationalized. The coincidence of the attacks on police officers isn&#39;t that unusual. No one should support violence towards the police unless it is a true case of self defense. Everyone has the right to protect themselves but no one has the right to harm another person without the need for self defense or defense of another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The examples of police shootings does not seem to point at all to an operation like gladio. It just seems like criminals going off the chain and killing police officers? </p>

<p>Added: also police deaths dropped the following two year by even more than the rise was in the first place and 2007 showed higher police death rates than 2010. Also why would a spike in 2010 have anything to do with now? It has been almost 5 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were two spikes, in 2010, and <a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/12/28/9775223-police-deaths-rise-sharply-again">in 2011</a>.</p>

<p>These were simultaneously lowest-crime-rate years.</p>

<p>Both &quot;anomalies&quot; go strikingly against the background trend.</p>

<p>The rise in high-profile police violence toward citizens began just before OWS (Oct. 2011) and corresponds to a rise in public protest.</p>

<p>The rise in the Pentagon&#39;s militarization of police also corresponds to the rise in public protest.  Allegedly this is because of &quot;military surplus&quot; but the U.S. has had military surplus in previous decades and never tried to circumvent the Posse Comitatus Act by militarizing local police departments.</p>

<p>Most of this is nothing that I&#39;m alone in saying.  Many, many other articles have been written correlating the rise in public discontent with domestic economic policies to the rise in police militarization and police brutality.</p>

<p>The only thing different or new that I&#39;m saying here is:  Statistically speaking, police violence should be corresponding to the FBI&#39;s own declining crime rate, which has been dropping steadily for years.</p>

<p>AND that Operation Gladio was a previous precedent for a Strategy of Tension to manipulate the political spectrum of nations using terror and crime. </p>

<p>And that the glaring disparity in the crime rate with the spike in police deaths &amp; police violence toward the public has not been adequately explained, but that it is <em>consistent with</em> -- even in the absence of &quot;proof&quot; ... which didn&#39;t come for years afterward with Gladio -- an invisible hand of political manipulation.</p>

<p>You appear to believe that police culture simply resets itself on a yearly basis. </p>

<p>As was said about Gladio:  &quot;It just seems like Leftist terrorists planting bombs across Europe.&quot;</p>

<p>In fact, it was the opposite.  But those European parliamentary investigations must have been conspiracy theorists.  And you must be on the wrong subreddit.</p>
