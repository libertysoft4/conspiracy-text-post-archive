    <div class="md"><p>And just like that, you&#39;ve proven my point.</p>

<p>Hiding behind your list of &quot;criteria&quot;, you&#39;ve allowed yourself to completely avoid any skepticism of your methods. See, my being a shill or not (spoiler: I&#39;m not) has nothing to do with the point I was making. If you were actually intellectually honest you should be able to defend the legitimacy of your post, regardless of whether I am a shill or not.</p>

<p>Instead you simply discount anything I said because you went through my history and decided I was a shill based on bullshit criteria. You use anything you can as an excuse discount differing opinions. That isn&#39;t how you determine actual truth. That is how you close your mind.</p>

<p>And that is the truly sad part... you view yourself as a seeker of truth and me as some disinformation agent when in reality you have it exactly backwards. And of course, you&#39;ll never understand this, because you&#39;ve already decided that I am the enemy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is any of that conclusive proof that I am a shill? I have recently become interested in conspiracy theories and have decided to begin posting my opinions in this subreddit in response to what I saw as bad information and bad science. People aren&#39;t shills because they disagree with you.</p>

<p>But like I said, whether I am a shill or not means absolutely nothing. Your opinions and beliefs should stand on fact alone. Prove to me the accuracy of the source you posted. The article appears to claim that one can identify a shill with no actual hard evidence, just through examination of their words. How was this determined to be effective. How many actually proven shill&#39;s (through other, more concrete methods like leaked documentation or admissions) comment history was this tested on to prove its effectiveness?</p>

<p>Stop building walls against differing opinions like a coward.</p>

<p>Saying that over and over and <strong>over</strong> won&#39;t change that fact.</p>

<p>Your integrity should be superseded by your need to not come off as a dickhead.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m reminded of a time I went to some shitty metalworking shop to sell some old plates.  It was horribly nasty, people were dirty.  I walked into their office through a cloud of smoke.  My nerves were already getting fiesty.  On the secretary&#39;s desk was that standard &quot;You catch more flies with honey.&quot;</p>

<p>Despite all of the atmospheric bullshit, the way she handled me changed my opinion of the place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My integrity was insulted the moment users in this thread insisted I was a shill for questioning their methods of determining what a shill actually is. Considering this, all I&#39;ve really done in this thread is ask for evidence in the face of continuing insults. Then, I make some observations stemming from my frustration with users deciding evidence wasn&#39;t as important as protecting confirmation bias, and you have the balls to say that I am a dickhead that needs to show more respect? What about the user calling me a shill? Not only is that an insult, it is against the rules of this subreddit. </p>

<p>Your intentions when making this thread may not have been to start a witch hunt against skepticism, but that is exactly what it did. </p>

<p>So please, don&#39;t accuse me of being disrespectful if you aren&#39;t going to point that same gaze on the people who happen to agree with you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you are right. Calling someone a shill isn&#39;t insulting. All they are saying is that you have so little integrity that you are willing to lie and distort information and be complicit in any number of horrible conspiracies/events for the purposes of payment. Nothing insulting there. There is also no reason to be mad when they use this baseless accusation to discredit anything you say and ignore any genuine questions, even after you state multiple times that you are just looking for better evidence.</p>

<p>How so? Even if I concede that my anger at the other user was unjustified (which I think is false), that hardly seems like enough evidence to think me somehow worse than you.</p>

<p>That shills exist?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will anyway.</p>

<p>I am trying to get the other user to describe the process they use to determine what users are shills. A link was provided that listed a variety of &quot;techniques&quot; that &quot;shills&quot; use. I was hoping the user could detail how these characteristics specifically applied to shills and how many independently verified shills were used to confirm the accuracy of the list.</p>

<p>I received no such data, instead only more accusations.</p>

<p>But even if you could demonstrate that statistically that the vote counts do go haywire outside the normal variability of new reddit submissions, you still have the problem of attribution to contend with. A lot of conspiracy theorists downvote reptilian/submissions that can be classified as racist. Do those downvoters qualify as shills? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize what you&#39;re asking isn&#39;t feasible, correct? </p>

<p>The entire idea behind a shill is that they&#39;re disposable internet voices.  To <strong>PROVE</strong> someone is shilling would require tracing their location, and really digging to find any money trail. </p>

<p>If anything from the &quot;ex-shill&quot; is true, nothing about the job is permanent or paper trail-able.</p>

<p>The idea that we need to catch a shill is silly.  Its easy as fuck to see people with an agenda to spread.  Does calling them out really accomplish anything? Nope.  But they&#39;re a permanent reminder that the system is gamed against <em>actual peoples</em> favor.</p>

<p>Are you implying they don&#39;t exist?</p>

<p>Edit: I guess I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;re even defending the idea of keeping your head in the sand.</p>

<p>Edit 2:  The term has evolved.  The only people who would prefer it to be strictly used for &quot;paid agenda pushers&quot; are shills themselves. And that&#39;s real. </p>

<p>Nonsense, haven&#39;t you seen the Congress Wiki edit twitter feeds and the like? In any case, if it&#39;s too much work for you to prove someone is a shill, don&#39;t say. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">Almost too easy. 
</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not implying that shills don&#39;t exist, take for example the Congressional Wiki Edit twitter feeds and the like.</p>

<p>I do however think that most all of the people that fritter away their time posting from a skeptical perspective (myself included) can&#39;t be classified as shills if one cares anything about the meaning of the word. </p>

<p>So you really are saying that anyone that disagrees with you is by definition a shill? Well done with that tautology. </p>

<p>Watched it happen first hand, but you can find it on FDA website. They do &quot;Inspections&quot; during trials. But not looking at the data.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve already established comprehension issues or stupidity, so what good would it do? You will not get it anyway, but here ya go.</p>

<p>In late September of 2008, Melamine was found in Baby Formula. Here is what FDA stated: &quot; A review done by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was <strong>unable to determine any level</strong> of melamine in infant formula that would be safe, the agency said Friday. &quot; (<a href="http://www.law360.com/articles/71507/no-amount-of-melamine-safe-in-baby-formula-fda">http://www.law360.com/articles/71507/no-amount-of-melamine-safe-in-baby-formula-fda</a>).</p>

<p>The guy who owned the factory in China was executed over it. Fast forward a couple months and US manufactures were caught with it in their formula. FDA stated: &quot;<strong>The levels that we are detecting are extremely low</strong>,&quot; said Dr. Stephen Sundlof, director of the FDA&#39;s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. &quot;They should not be changing the diet. If they&#39;ve been feeding a particular product, they should continue to feed that product. That&#39;s in the best interest of the baby.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/demands-for-baby-formula-recall-mount-26-11-2008/">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/demands-for-baby-formula-recall-mount-26-11-2008/</a></p>

<p>Now, before your dumbass states that it was higher levels, go look up the data, I have wasted enough time already on turds like you. Look it up your damn self lazy. </p>

<p>So, why did FDA suddenly change their mind? From &quot;Food and Drug Administration was unable to determine any level of melamine in infant formula that would be safe&quot; to Keep feeding your baby, even though we just stated otherwise a couple of months ago.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/stephen-sundlof/33/408/93a">https://www.linkedin.com/pub/stephen-sundlof/33/408/93a</a>   Dr. Stephen Sundlof now has a great couple of jobs, working with Federal Grants and working on &quot;Policy&quot; projects. That means he is part of a &quot;Lobby&quot; effort to help protect his donors. Do some digging and see exactly how it works with ALL of these pricks.</p>

<p>Paste his name in Google and the names of the major pharmaceutical companies and you can see all of the &quot;Favors&quot; he does for them. You can also find his high dollar speaking engagements paid for by major pharmaceutical companies. He is a sellout and part of the controlled medical community.</p>

<p>Now, if modern medicine is so great, why must they &quot;control&quot; the science, conversations and policy?</p>

<p>Dr. Stephen Sundlof is not the only one, I can show blatant conflicts of interest of hundreds of these guys doing the exact same thing. It&#39;s your job, just as it was mine, to look up all of this information and learn for yourself.</p>

<p>Power corrupts, and absolute power...well, you know the rest. so how does power come to be? MONEY, and lot&#39;s of it.</p>

<p>I, or someone else should slap the taste out of your mouth for being so damn stupid.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How uneducated are you? You are the one making your case, you do the research to prove your point. DOn&#39;t ask others to do research for you. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then why do or did you go to school if someone provided you everything? Your world view is what makes you such a blind douche bag. You have zero worth, you need a document to think you are somebody! That means you&#39;re insignificant in your own mind and everything you are is propped up with paper, but nothing of substance and absolutely zero real world experience or knowledge.</p>

<p>As far as education, I have  G.E.D. but have many (about 30 people) with masters, doctorates and everything below working for me, a couple from Harvard, and others from lesser ( In your mind anyway) colleges, so who&#39;s the stupid one here hotshot? I authorize their paychecks. lol!</p>

<p>I have to deal with FDA on a consistent basis and know very well how they operate. I Import, and have to deal with them on every single product I develop, produce, manufacture and sell both online and in brick and mortar businesses. I know what I am talking about, you&#39;re reciting what your brainwashed professors tell you. Just remember, they were brainwashed like you and are parroting what they learned to you...even if it&#39;s wrong.</p>

<p>The US health industry is run by bribes and the proverbial &quot;revolving doors&quot;, they heal nothing, they treat symptoms, while using dangerous drugs they concocted to do it. Emergency medicine is the only thing they do right, the rest is all political, corruption, lobbying and paid off NGO&#39;s and &quot;Foundations&quot;, all staffed by the same people who are corrupt.</p>

<p>could you explain the difference between a syndrome and a disorder? I can, one is based on physiology, the other is based on assumptions.</p>

<p>When was the last time someone diagnosed with &quot;Depression&quot; has had a test of their levels of melatonin in the brain? Huh hotshot? you&#39;re dumb as a brick.</p>

<p>Why are ALL vaccines given in groups? Because they don&#39;t want public correlation. I know, I know, and the educated morons sing &quot;Correlation does not equal causation&quot;. Here ya go <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2012/10/correlation_does_not_imply_causation_how_the_internet_fell_in_love_with_a_stats_class_clich_.html">http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2012/10/correlation_does_not_imply_causation_how_the_internet_fell_in_love_with_a_stats_class_clich_.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>not talking about the &quot;first suggestion&quot;, it really does not take long to spot a poster with an agenda and then just a short amount of time more to confirm it. 2weeks is more than enough if they post everyday or so. many of our regular shills cycle accounts though, so you only see each name every other week or so. even so, i spot them, i know them, if the mods are paying attention they should too.</p>

<p>I am trying to get the other user to describe the process they use to determine what users are shills. A link was provided that listed a variety of &quot;techniques&quot; that &quot;shills&quot; use. I was hoping the user could detail how these characteristics specifically applied to shills and how many independently verified shills were used to confirm the accuracy of the list.</p>

<p>I received no such data, instead only more accusations.</p>
