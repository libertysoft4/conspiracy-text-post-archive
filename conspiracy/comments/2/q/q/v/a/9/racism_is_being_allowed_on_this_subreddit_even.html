        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t remember how long I have been frequenting this subreddit but it appears that racism has been allowed since I came along at least a year ago.</p>

<p>The user in my example is originally (when I saw him) <a href="/u/4to3">/u/4to3</a>. That account was banned from here for racism thus <a href="/u/4to4">/u/4to4</a> was created.</p>

<p>You&#39;d think that creating an account that gives away that the user is an account that was banned for racism...it&#39;d be an easy way to remove the racist (who, by the way, isn&#39;t just going to stop one day as we have seen).</p>

<p>At this point the user continued their racism and I began to document by taking <a href="http://imgur.com/a/IFmb1">screenshots</a>. </p>

<p>Again, after having to tell the mods myself, the user was banned. Progress, right? No. We all know how easy it is to make another account and to continue spewing racism.</p>

<p>Yet again I tried to discuss the allowing of a racist to post here why it&#39;s an issue <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2pt6vd/rworldnews_keeps_deleting_my_critique_of_ny_times/cn07ojj">here</a>.</p>

<p>It became obvious that <a href="/u/internetpropagandist">/u/internetpropagandist</a> doesn&#39;t fully understand <a href="/u/4to6">/u/4to6</a>, likening the user as a troll:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If a user posts racist things and gets banned, I don&#39;t see the issue. The person behind the accounts will eventually learn not to post racist things. Additionally, banning their new alt for a previous alt&#39;s content will give them motivation to create even more alts and spam the hell out of this sub with more racist things than you otherwise would have to deal with. - Dealing with trolls 101</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can see how reactive banning is an issue and that it should be proactive if the user is going to be obvious with his account names.  We can also see <a href="http://imgur.com/a/bhG7e"><strong>here</strong></a> that InternetPropagandist is again wrong with thinking that the racist will &quot;eventually learn not to post racist things&quot;. All the user has learned is that they have no worry about posting racist things because they&#39;ll have to take a few minutes to create a new account.</p>

<p>If we don&#39;t want to give <a href="/r/isrconspiracyracist">/r/isrconspiracyracist</a> fuel then I would think we could be smart enough to ban a known racist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re interested, I&#39;m currently having a &quot;discussion&quot; with the user you have cited over the issue of intelligence of black people.

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2qo81v/what_on_earth_is_happening/">http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2qo81v/what_on_earth_is_happening/</a></p>

<p>But you&#39;re always going to get racist people around these parts of the Internet. Unfortunately it often comes with the conspiratorial territory so to speak. </p>

<p>I think particularly with the hardcore NWO clique, there is common ground with racists. At least there seems to be. And I think it has been going on long before Reddit, or even the World Wide Web as we know it today. </p>

<p>I recall a Louis Theroux documentary on US Survivalists (or preppers as they are known today). They were concerned about the UN coming into there neighborhood and declaring a one world government etc. They were innocent in what they were doing, and they noted that there were white supremacist groups who would always try and affiliate themselves with the survivalists. For the most part, they would try and distance themselves from the racists, but often times that was difficult to do. This was in the late 1990s.  </p>

<p>Well, the unfortunate truth is that within the field of genetics, there is no debate on this point: some racial groups have higher average IQ than others, and this isn&#39;t considered to be entirely the result of &quot;nurture&quot;, rather than &quot;nature.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the sort of thing one would bring up in ordinary conversation, but because not all environments (climatic, social, dietary, etc) were/are the same, different human populations have gradually evolved subtly different (average) physical, mental, and psychological inhertiable traits. These differences are obviously not merely limited to skin pigmentation, nose bridge height, etc.</p>

<p>Environmental factors have, for example, for some human populations, required greater levels of analytical intelligence, thus natural selection (successful humans = more surviving children) has gradually increased this trait (on average) in those populations which evolved in these environments.</p>

<p>Of course this information can be used by idiots to discriminate against groups based on superficial traits which correlate with (for example) higher/lower average group IQ, but the information isn&#39;t inherently discriminatory.</p>

<p><a href="https://torrentz.eu/4f3aa8b95877ef920567b28ce5bf5def16975ec2">&#39;The 10,000 Year Explosion&#39;</a> is an interesting book which explores the notion that the rate of human evolutionary change has <em>increased</em> as a result of &quot;civilization&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, natural selection over 5 generations can presumably yield increases in average IQ, but my understanding (admittedly not great) is that you&#39;d want more generations to start to see <em>significant</em> differences, over a population, in a trait like analytical intelligence.</p>

<p>The last chapter of the book I just added to my comment above discusses Ashkenazi evolution since the Medieval period and environmental factors which may have led to higher-than-average IQ in that group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok thanks. I&#39;ll look into that. However, I am slightly cautious because this area of discussion is dangerously close to racist pseudo-science. But then again, I would have said the same about the holocaust a few months ago, so I&#39;ll give it a read :)</p>

<p>On the Ashkenazi Jews, I read that the Russian Tsar (forgot which one), wanted desperately to integrate the Russian Jewish population into the rest of society. The way he did that was by making school compulsory for all Jewish children, something that wasn&#39;t given to the rest of the population. He thought that this would give them the chance to leave the ghettos, make Russian friends as children and forget about Jewish culture. Unfortunately, this backfired and caused the Russian Jews to be overrepresented in Russian politics, business and finance compared to their uneducated ethnic Russians.</p>

<p>Yeah, that was my assumption too, before I started to look into it. But if you google &quot;behavioral genetics&quot; you&#39;ll see this is a genuine field of study. Scientific progress is always a &quot;two steps forward, one step back&quot; process, so we needn&#39;t be completely put off by the mistakes of earlier researchers.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>My understanding is that this over-representation occurred much earlier. For various reasons (including pre-Calvinist Christian prohibitions on usury) European Jews started to specialize as white collar workers very early -- thus formal education was seen as essential -- and as societies began to develop, they were well placed to participate in politics, business, finance (etc) on a greater level than the other, previously non-urban agrarian populations. The last chapter of that book is definitely worth reading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Natural selection begins to play a part in determining intelligence levels over large numbers of generations. The intelligence level of a race is not set in stone. There are signs that the racial intelligence of whites is dropping rapidly, because we are allowing more whites of low intelligence to thrive and have many children. Stupidity is supported and rewarded in our society. Of course, the same applies to American blacks -- the stupidest individuals are having the most babies, which are then being raised on welfare.</p>

<p>Exactly. A more challenging environment -- in which the &quot;strongest&quot; reproduce more/faster than the &quot;weakest&quot; -- slowly creates a higher average level of capability in the population. When natural limitations are removed, or even reversed, that isn&#39;t good -- assuming the goal is to slowly increase the capability/strength of the population.</p>

<p>Of course, whether that is the goal depends on whether the ruling class identify as part of the population, or consider themselves to be a separate race, trying to breed a race/races of weak slaves beneath them.</p>

<p>If you have a black family and white family who raise their children within a modern, middle-class (dare I say Western) environment and give the children the same level of educational opportunities.

</blockquote>

<p>This is the &quot;nurture&quot; argument, and it is not what behavioral geneticists are saying. They say there is an inherited basis for greater or lower (average) analytical intelligence in certain populations, due to evolution over many generations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The user in question was claiming that black people are almost incapable of reaching levels of intelligence compared to white people. Which of course is not true. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The issue here is that skin pigmentation correlates with certain human populations which have followed subtly different evolutionary paths. Obviously intelligence is not caused by skin pigmentation (nor vice versa).</p>

<p>Their claim that different populations (which coincidentally have different skin pigmentation) have different levels of average IQ is valid, and has been measured and confirmed numerous times.</p>

<p>The effect of lower or higher average IQ expresses itself far more dramatically at the upper and lower ends of the population distribution. A group with average IQ of, say, 0.75 of a standard deviation higher, would result in many times the number of high-intelligence individuals (&quot;geniuses&quot;) than the comparison group -- due to the bell-curve shape of the distribution.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sure the children of the black family will perform just as well as the white family throughout their academic and career history. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe this has actually been tested in humans: babies from lower-IQ groups transplanted into parental/socioeconomic environments of the higher-IQ groups. On average, they perform just as well as the higher-IQ group at a lower age, but there is a tendency for them to slip back to the lower-IQ group average in later life.</p>

<p>Similar tests done with mice confirm that intelligence is mostly &quot;nature&quot;. The performance of the worst 7th generation &quot;maze smart&quot; mice, raised by &quot;maze stupid&quot; mothers, was better than the best 7th gen &quot;maze stupid&quot; mouse raised by &quot;maze smart&quot; mothers. [See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryon%27s_Rat_Experiment">Tyron&#39;s Rat Experiment</a>]</p>

<p>Edit: <a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/40459/title/Inherited-Intelligence/">here&#39;s testing with chimpanzees which confirms a genetic basis for intelligence</a>. If intelligence is inherited, then due to natural selection, populations will gradually evolve higher/lower comparable levels of intelligence, based on environmental differences. Which is exactly what has happened with humans -- no different to other animals.</p>

<p>I would disagree that this is the only way. An environment which required high-IQ for survival/breeding would eventually result in a higher average IQ based on natural selection (as well as the potential for high-stress environments to increase genetic mutation.) It would just take time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you are correct. Natural selection will come into play unless thwarted by the existing society. However, it is worth noting that black Africans have not shown a higher intelligence level throughout their entire history. Where are the monoliths? Where are the great temples? Where are the roads, the canals, the aquaducts, the cities, the ports? There aren&#39;t any.

<p>No, they wouldn&#39;t. That&#39;s my point. When something is racial in nature, changing the environment or education will not change it. The tests have been done, by men who are much brighter than me. Take blacks and raise them from Day One in the same environment as white babies, and then test them. The blacks, as a group, always test lower than the whites, as a group. Not sometimes, but always.</p>

<p>Over a very long span of time, natural selection may come into play -- but it is worth noting that it did not come into play for black Africans over the entire course of their history. They never achieved a high civilization, even though living conditions for the various tribal groups must have varied widely on thousands of years of history, some conditions bad but others very good.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been established that these racial, genetic differences in intelligence levels exist. What is still speculation is <em>why</em> they exist. Natural selection is very likely a factor, over dozens or hundreds of generations.</p>

<p>There may be something else at work. I find it interesting that the race of man known as the Neanderthal has left its genetic code in modern whites and Asians, but not in the negroid race. Apparently African negroes never interbred with Neanderthals. White caucasians did interbreed with them. Does this have any bearing on the lower intelligence of blacks? I don&#39;t know, but I find it suggestive.</p>

<p>Summary here: <a href="http://rense.com/general77/racedif.htm">http://rense.com/general77/racedif.htm</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>Neither the existence nor the size of race differences in IQ are a matter of dispute, only their cause</strong>,&quot; write the authors. The Black-White difference has been found consistently from the time of the massive World War I Army testing of 90 years ago to a massive study of over 6 million corporate, military, and higher-education test-takers in 2001.</p>

<p>&quot;Race differences show up by 3 years of age, even after matching on maternal education and other variables,&quot; said Rushton. &quot;<strong>Therefore they cannot be due to poor education since this has not yet begun to exert an effect</strong>. That&#39;s why Jensen and I looked at the genetic hypothesis in detail ...</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, firstly, the article is a survey of research evidence from around the world, over the last 30 years. But regarding these categories, as Wikipedia notes, in the entry for &#39;Mongoloid&#39;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the term mongoloid is now <strong>considered derogatory</strong> by most anthropologists due to its association with disputed typological models of racial classification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, rather than &quot;debunked&quot;, I think we can say &quot;disputed&quot; -- and then, seemingly, largely due to associated social taboos. To me it seems some anthropologists use these terms, and some don&#39;t. The slur &quot;unscientific&quot; is too often thrown-around in such heated debates, so I am cautious to draw strong conclusions when it comes to racial typology.</p>

<p>The link you&#39;ve provided (&quot;proven to be false&quot;) gets off to a fairly poor start, when the author writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>phrases such as “politically correct” and “cultural Marxism” are buzzwords frequently used by extremist right-wing…thinkers, who are often anti-immigration</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To me, it seems he is looking at racial classification in a predetermined, political way, rather than a pure scientific way. (He is also very down on &quot;conspiratorial thinking&quot; -- honestly, the whole page reeks of uptight, pseudo-intellectual outrage.) I&#39;d be interested to read more about this stuff, though, and will look for some better sources.</p>

<p>Just searching Wikipedia, I see these terms of classification are still being cited, e.g.:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1996, professor of anthropology, Akazawa Takeru (Japanese:赤沢威) of the International Research Center for Japanese Studies, Kyoto, said Mongoloids originated in Xinjiang during the &quot;Ice Age&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongoloid">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongoloid</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negroid">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negroid</a></p>

<p>&lt;shrugs&gt; ...my understanding is still that if you have groups evolving separately in different environments over a long enough time period, there are going to be different &quot;races&quot; [and if there are different &quot;races&quot; then there needs to be an attempt to create a system of classification,</p>

<p>see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_%28human_classification%29#Views_across_disciplines_over_time">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_%28human_classification%29#Views_across_disciplines_over_time</a></p>

<p>Metapedia, predictably, has links to studies which confirm that racial typology is still an accepted concept in the hard sciences:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A 2010 examination of 18 widely used English anatomy textbooks found that every one relied on the existence of races. The study gives examples of how the textbooks state that anatomical features vary between races</p>

<p><a href="http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Arguments_regarding_the_existence_of_races#cite_note-66">http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Arguments_regarding_the_existence_of_races#cite_note-66</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>as I had suspected, studies seem to confirm that culture/politics is a major factor:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A study from 2004 found that &quot;Rejection of race ranges from high to low with the highest rejection occurring among anthropologists in the United States (and Canada). Rejection of race is moderate in Europe, sizeable in Poland and Cuba, and lowest in Russia and China.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but Native Americans didn&#39;t have any of these either. But just a few hundred miles to the south, the Mayans, Aztecs and Toltecs built megastructures that, in the words of Cortes, far exceeded anything Europe had created at the time of his discovery. And even their Inca neighbours in South America built incredible temples and structures of civilisation in ridiculous altitudes and surroundings (e.g. the ruins of Michu Pichu).</p>

<p>They can&#39;t have been that different to Native Americans in North America. Before the smallpox outbreak which killed 90% of the Native population (just before the Europeans began colonising, strangely enough), the Native Americans had a thriving and culturally rich population of ~100 million. But because they preferred the simple life, doesn&#39;t mean that they are less intelligent.</p>

<p>Edit: Didn&#39;t Sub-saharan Africans establish Timbuktu?</p>

<p>In my opinion, the more the geographical surroundings force a group of people to settle down and become &#39;civilised&#39;, the more warlike a group becomes, and the more advanced technologies they will create in order to overcome the neighbouring tribe. </p>

<p>Europe is perfect for creating lots of little tribes competing against one another, due to it&#39;s diverse geography (lots of mountains, lakes and rivers to separate groups of people into small areas where they&#39;re forced to settle in the most favourable areas to thrive). However, places like Africa, Asian Russia, Australia and North America had nomadic populations and had no need to settle down into tribes, or settle down at all as their geography meant that establishing a permanent home wasn&#39;t necessary. Even today, many groups like the Mongols, the Maasai and south american tribes have no need to settle and continue a nomadic lifestyle. </p>

<p>In Australia, even in areas where there were tribes, they didn&#39;t even have wars. They had tribal leaders fight each other to settle differences and disputes. Therefore, they didn&#39;t even invent the bow and arrow (IIRC) and just hunted with spears. Technological advancement was unnecessary, as there was no need for it. Though if a tribe in Europe had this attitude, they would have been wiped out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is interesting to see how hidebound and dogmatic people can be on certain topics. Subscribers to this sub are for the most part open-minded, and like to think of themselves as awake, but there are different stages in being awake.</p>

<p>The lie that &quot;all men are created equal&quot; is a lie that many intelligent persons cling to dogmatically. They are afraid to let go of it, because of what the significance would be if it is not true -- and of course it is not true. All men are not equal, or the same. All races are not equal, or the same. We can call them equal in the eyes of God if we like, but that doesn&#39;t erase the inequalities that actually exist in the real world.</p>

<p>Of course, to say that races are not the same is quite a different thing from saying that one race is &quot;better&quot; in a moral sense than another race. I don&#39;t believe that any race is &quot;better&quot; than any other race -- but I do believe that some races are more intelligent than other races, and this has massive consequences in our history and even in our individual lives.</p>

<p>The racism is pretty obvious if you ask me. </p>

<p>Yes, your summary of my point is correct -- negroes are genetically different from other races. This gives blacks unique racial characteristics. One of these is a lower racial intelligence level than the level of most other races (Australian aborigines are as low as the lowest of the racial intelligence levels measured in black African tribes).</p>

<p>This is a racial -- that is to say, a collective -- measure of intelligence, not an individual measure. There are many negroes of very high intelligence. We&#39;re talking about racial intelligence levels, here.</p>

<p>Because these differences in intelligence are racial, they cannot be changed by better education, different environments, different diets, and so on. They are racial. They are genetic. If you did a test and raised a large group of black Africans in exactly the same way as a large group of European whites, the whites will always score, collectively, a much higher IQ level than the blacks. Always. This does not vary.</p>

<p>The only way to change racial intelligence levels is through racial interbreeding. When negroes have children with caucasians, the mixed race child is, on average, more intelligent than the purely negro child. This isn&#39;t hate, this is science. This is not racism, it is the reality of our world.</p>

<p>You must start showing us credible sources for your claims. Otherwise it&#39;s difficult to take you seriously at all. </p>

<p>And the word &quot;<em>negro</em>&quot; has some serious negative connotations which harks back to the day&#39;s when slavery, segregation, and discrimination of black people was considered acceptable. Why do you use it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you become emotionally hostile at the use of the word &quot;negro?&quot; Have you ever examined your response to the word? It is a perfectly good word that was used in polite conversation for centuries, until very recent times, when it somehow acquired a negative connotation. Where did this negative connotation come from? Have you ever asked yourself this? Why do you allow others who you do not even know to determine which existing words you may use, and which you should not only censor from your own speech, but try to censor from the speech of complete strangers? Why have you chosen to appoint yourself society&#39;s word censor? Or did you choose?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was acceptable when slavery of black people was acceptable. It&#39;s not acceptable in polite society anymore. Now the term black is acceptable, it wasn&#39;t when slavery was. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just because that word harks back to times when slavery of black people was the norm, which of course was a horrible point in history.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to what is now the most important part of this discussion we&#39;re having. </p>

<p>Then you&#39;re alright with zero moderation here? Because censoring racism isn&#39;t the only censorship that the moderators engage in here.</p>

<p>No. By doing that the racist may actually continue to think their beliefs are right and I&#39;d rather not allow that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no racism here. We are discussing differences in racial intelligence. That has nothing to do with racism. There&#39;s no hatred against blacks as a race.

Neither is discussion of racial differences.</p>

<p>Or we could be proactive and give them no reason to allow such a classification to begin with.</p>

<p>And yet I look over to the sidebar and see 11 possible ways to be censored.</p>

<p>Apparently it really is that hard because I disagree with giving them a platform to spew their racism.</p>
