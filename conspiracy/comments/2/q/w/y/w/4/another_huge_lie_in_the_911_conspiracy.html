        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I only just picked this one up, so a little back story is necessary. </p>

<p>I was watching one of those Air Crash investigation videos on YouTube and it mentioned the story of Mohammed Atta&#39;s luggage.  The official narrative says - Atta&#39;s flight to Boston was delayed, which is why the baggage never made it onto the deadly flight.  </p>

<p>I sat and thought about it for a while, there just seemed something wrong with this story.  So, I went and read up on the official story and it turns out my hunch was 100% correct.  Yes his flight was delayed.  However, his flight to Boston was on the 9th of September, two full days prior to catching the plane he&#39;d supposedly slam into the tower.  </p>

<p>So, this luggage which conveniently contained a hand written will and notes on why he was about to slam a plane into the twin towers, was checked in on the 11th September.  This luggage is yet another very obvious plant.  Just as his miracle passport was also an obvious plant.  </p>

Its as if seconds before slamming a jet into a building at hundreds of MPH, he opened a window and tossed it out so someone could find it.  Mind you, it survived the explosion, inferno, and the eventual collapse.  I&#39;m amazed that sheep still believe this filth.</p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s an irrelevant to the topic really  and a genuinely bad comparison, since no matter how absurd you may think of the official story, find a piece of paper after a giant explosion is not a strange occurrence and has happened everytime anything gets blown up.</p>

<p>well 2 collapsed from fire, the other half dozen buildings collapsed as a result of fire and from damage incurred when 2 million ton buildings collapsed and launched debris everywhere.</p>

<p>categorically incorrect. </p>

<p>Windsor tower, mccormick center, strasborg theatre, and the meridian plaza which showed very similar damage- despite actually having a concerted firefighting effort put forth.  And all of which did not have fuel loaded jumbo jets destroy critical load bearing columns.</p>

<p>considering no accurate estimate has even been given to how long they took to fall, this is bullshit- and that there&#39;s a considerable amount of evidence indicating the time taken was considerably greater than &quot;free fall speed, i also call that bullshit.</p>

<p>Nor does the assumption that <em>even if</em> the building did in fact fall at freefall speed- actually lead to anything other than &quot;it fell at free fall speed&quot;. Anything further is a gross extrapolation.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Thing occurring contrary to an expected outcome shouldn&#39;t lead anyone to take such a great leap of faith that there was some colluded intent- especially when a plausible, simplistic and well-recieved explanation is given toward the unexpected outcome.

<p>because i don&#39;t believe in preaching to the choir. I think views are reinforced only by having them challenged. </p>

<p>So when i want to think about how strongly i feel about an event, i look to alternate interpretations to see how well founded my beliefs are. Subsequently, all the poor logic, fallacies, outright willful ignorance and false equivalencies quickly remind me that the conclusion i&#39;ve arrived it is the more accurate one.</p>

<p>I hold that deep-dish pizza is an abhorrent travesty. I don&#39;t support this view by only eating thin-crust pizza. I eat all the deep-dish pizza i can, and thus find out i was correct in my original view.</p>

<p>You&#39;re correct about this, but this wasn&#39;t the basis of my argument. </p>

<p>It <em>is</em> however, reason enough to believe the people who say these things have no idea what they&#39;re talking about. Which, considering they&#39;re the only ones saying it- seems like a good reason to be doubtful. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suffice to say that if someone butchered an explanation of the water cycle to me, I still wouldn&#39;t sell my umbrella.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To expand upon this, it&#39;s not about doubting the water cycle.</p>

<p>I can see the rain. I know if i need an umbrella. No one (well there are some probably) is questioning &quot;the towers came down&quot; or &quot;jfk was shot&quot; or &quot;there is a moon&quot;. Just like no one would be questioning that it rains.</p>

<p>If i want a deeper understanding of the water cycle i start questioning it. I know what is involved in this. I&#39;ve had to defend a thesis. I&#39;ve had to explore every single angle contrary to what i was trying to say.</p>

<p>And in my search for &quot;alternate&quot; ideas about how water moves around the atmosphere i come across only unsupported suppositions, paranoid coincidences, and really nothing resembling a platform it suggests to me there are no alternate ideas.  I&#39;m not dismissing it because they were poorly formatted (though that doesn&#39;t help), i&#39;m dismissing it because the <em>don&#39;t</em> hold up to scrutiny. Simply <em>saying</em> something doesn&#39;t make it legitimate.  There isn&#39;t <em>any</em> kid of good counter-argument, well written or otherwise. It&#39;s purely a mishmash of misunderstandings, poor interpretations and bad logic.  I&#39;ve  watched every youtube video, read every copypasta, seen all the arguments time and time again- and i read this forum a lot. That is me putting forward a concerted effort to &quot;learn&quot; and all it does is continually reinforce my view.</p>

<p>I guess that&#39;s fair, though I&#39;d gripe about using &quot;don&#39;t know&quot; rather than &quot;have no idea&quot; (still rather hesitant to throw that baby out with the bath water).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure really. At least in the case of 9/11 it&#39;s a case of semantics. Yes, they certainly used the event as causus belli- and yes there was push to get involved in the middle east before the events. Whether that&#39;s a conspiracy technically, literally or casually is up for debate (and i don&#39;t really have an opinion either way). The whole WMD was pretty jaw droppingly dumb, moreso in retrospect- i think that could be called a conspiracy. Certainly on rummy&#39;s end. </p>

<p>And of course, things like COINTELLIPRO and all that jazz- i&#39;m not sitting here pretending the government is perfect or that people in power love transparency.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>sure, you could just keep tacking on arguments based on the weakest of evidence (or lack of evidence) but i don&#39;t that makes those arguments salient. The uncertainty principle is important, but there&#39;s a point where it becomes counter productive; one has to play it carefully against the principle of falsifiability. The point is- continually pushing forward using some spotty data as &quot;evidence&quot; for something happening isn&#39;t really the best of logic. The smallest inconsistency or unexpected occurrence suddenly becomes the smoking gun. This happens constantly. They found his passport! They found some bbc mistaking &quot;going to fall&quot; for &quot;had fallen&quot;! Mohamed Atta wasn&#39;t a devout muslim! Sept 11th is the same date George Bush Sr gave the New World Order speech! Checkmate shills!</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t need to, i&#39;m aware of them. And even the most legitimate isn&#39;t really evidence of much beyond itself.  </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s also important to remember that all of that aside, there&#39;s still an event which cost the lives of 3000 americans, was a <em>massive</em> breach of  security and undoubtedly one of the most important events of history in the last 50 years... and frankly just a really confusing event. Chaos alone should be reason to dismiss a lot.   Even the most perfect, transparent utopia might issue some incongruent statemtents and prefer some elements to remain undisclosed. That fact in itself again, isn&#39;t evidence of anything really. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That said, the official story can&#39;t be proven either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>again addressing uncertainty, you&#39;re correct i guess. I&#39;m not entirely sure of the methodology involved in acquiring an appropriate confidence value for saying &quot;these things happened&quot;. But not every theory is codified with P values.  Instead volume of evidence and the legitimacy of that evidence (and how well it holds up to criticism) are crucial to forming scientific consensus. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you understand how this matters, regardless of its apparent implication in taking down the buildings.</p>

<p>Cool. A bunch of words and numbers that don&#39;t really arrive at much of a conclusion on their own. Your &quot;assumptions&quot; are your own. Even a cursory investigation of Bazant&#39;s work as a structural engineer would show how much he focuses on decreases load strength over time, decreasing material quality and increasing instability over time- which of course has considerable impact on the comparisons between &quot;How the were built&quot; and &quot;How the were later&quot;, which seems to be a keypoint in your foggy understanding. </p>

<p>Which really are not comparable stresses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there is not one single scientific or physical model of the collapse).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Says who? As far as i&#39;m aware there are some pretty well regarded models, the only ones doing the rejecting are the denialists. </p>

<p>Furthermore, that doesn&#39;t really matter. There aren&#39;t a whole lot of single scientific models of <em>anything</em>. Even rigidly controlled laboratory studied systems, and not you know.. an incredibly chaotic event with little in the way of observational data collection.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Blatant discrepancy between observed and expected outcomes is a logical reason to inspect something, and at this scale, scientific investigation, skepticism and scrutiny are indicated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And after being inespected, quite rigorously by a lot of people, the same thing keeps being returned.   That the leap to something fishy going on is entirely a projection and a gross extrapolation biased heavily by what is probably paranoia, anti-establishmentism or whatever other pre-existing agenda.</p>

<p>there is no way to deny the inevitability of progressive collapse driven by gravity alone if this criterion is satisfied (for the World Trade Center it is satisfied with an order-of-magnitude margin).

<p>And he then goes on to outline the critical 7 features of tower collapse.  He even mentions rejecting conspiracy theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also according to the world&#39;s leading expert: let&#39;s compare the Twins&#39; collapses with building demolitions. Let&#39;s <em>engineer</em> different modes of collapse:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is proposed to monitor the precise time history of displacements <em>in building demolitions</em> — for example, by radio telemetry from sacrificial accelerometers, or high-speed optical camera — and to engineer different modes of collapse to be monitored. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emphasis mine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So i&#39;m not really sure what your argument is or how it leads to anything other than the official story (the official story being the entire basis of this paper)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please pay attention. The official story is that the towers were, during collapse, three times heavier than the structure could support, and that this is the reason why, after initiation, collapse was <em>&quot;inevitable&quot;</em>. </p>

<p>That is also the reason why there are only pretty computer animations, because nowadays everyone can download Blender, a physics engine plugin, code a tower and tinker away with the parameters until it collapses or floats into the clouds and vomits rainbows and call it a &quot;simulation&quot; or a &quot;model&quot;, which is precisely what NIST and Purdue did, which you cannot deny and I cannot prove because the data is not open source for very obvious reasons, and by virtue of being a black box cannot be replicated, verified or falsified, and therefor is <em>unscientific</em> by the very definition of the scientific method. </p>

<p>That is also the reason why you will not be able to build a physical model of the collapse without springs and levers or something dangling from your ceiling, and why not even a house of cards will exhibit progressive top-down collapse, and most of your domino towers will fall sideways. </p>

<p>Because building something that is three times heavier than it can support so it can fall through and out of itself is a frigging feat and a proof for intent, an intelligent balancing act, not the result of an accident, and all you can do is type words with no meaning if you try to disprove this statement. </p>

<p>And you won&#39;t even try, because what is really happening right now is that some guy in a faraway land is taking his precious time to explain to you the official conspiracy theory with its own words, mathematics and models. The official conspiracy theory is that there were no explosives, that the towers were sound structures apart from the zones locally damaged by the impacts, and that a 2 mile high tower forged from adamantium would have exhibited the very same features had a failure of the sixth floor from the top initiated global collapse - if, and only if, W[g] &gt; W[p] by an order of magnitude, and only if the mechanism is damn well lubricated and not accidentally snags and locks and brakes the descent. It would be too embarrassing if it looked like one of those demolition <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP7dnI4Ajwc">fails</a>. </p>

<p>The energetic signatures and collapse features of WTC 1 &amp; 2 exhibit, even according to the official conspiracy theory, by an order of several magnitudes, a large enough deviance from the set of data comprising all accidental total and partial collapse modes for tall buildings at all scales to reasonably warrant serious objections to the claims the plane impacts and resulting office fires or maybe an accidental slipshod fuckup were responsible for the utter demise of the Twin Towers - worse even, except for the top-down feature, the energetic signatures correspond best with intentional collapses like the buildings models from Roland Emmerich&#39;s <em>Independence Day</em>, conventional high-rise controlled demolitions and the occult magic collapse of Barad-Dûr in <em>Lord Of The Rings</em>. </p>

<p>If you wish, please write more about how conspiracy theorists misunderstand or misrepresent; about how all buildings are designed that way or how the Twin&#39;s design was unique; how they succumbed to the sheer mass from above or how they were so very lightweight, how it was because of planes or fire or momentum and gravity or architectural quirks or plastic buckling or the brittleness of steel; how it is all explained by the experts and how you are not sure what the argument is; how people are mean and condescending towards you or how they patiently reach out for you as a scientist, as a human being, trying to communicate the idea that reason, logic and scientific inquiry <em>dictate</em> skepticism and criticism of the results of the official investigations. </p>

<p>So let me spell it out for you: my argument is that if you say Lord Voldemort zapped the Twins from the Death Star to reset the Matrix, you are saner than if you pretend the towers collapsed because Arabs hate our freedom so much. </p>

<p>and what is this supposed to indicate exactly?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The official story is that the towers were, during collapse, three times heavier than the structure could support, and that this is the reason why, after initiation, collapse was &quot;inevitable&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yes. Did you miss all the parts in the paper how he explains how this is possible? Hint: it underpins not only the paper itself (and further discussions on the paper by the author himself  published through NWU), but Bazant&#39;s lifelong research and that is that stuff changes over time. A building is not the same in year Y as year Z with respect to loadbearing capability.</p>

<p>In fact, that same author published <em>another</em> paper shortly after completely dismissing any ideas about controlled demolitions. I&#39;m not sure why you keep quoting this  guy when he says things like this.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>and again you missed the point of the paper. I <em>can</em> build a model that will degrade significantly over time. Perhaps i leave my house-of-cards out in my sunroom and they become dry and brittle. My cat darts past this building, and the slightest wooshing of air the whole thing evaporates into dust while it was, previously, standing.</p>

<p>This is known in civil engineering as creep. Bazant studies this and the relationship of other material elasticities used in construction. He was not only a pioneer in understanding something that was never known about, but also applied that knowledge in understanding the mechanics of the tower collapse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and out of itself is a frigging feat and a proof for intent</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where&#39;s the proof for intent?</p>

<p>How is building something decades before effects like concrete elasticity were properly understood <em>proof</em> for collusion for its destruction?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that a 2 mile high tower forged from adamantium would have exhibited the very same features had a failure of the sixth floor from the top initiated global collapse </p>
</blockquote>

<p>i&#39;m not sure where you made that assumption.  Bazant takes care to explain the importance of selected materials.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It would be too embarrassing if it looked like one of those demolition fails.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right. So they just &quot;winged it&quot; and rigged up a system to perfectly demolish 2 buildings, without a hitch and not like one of those russian youtube fails.... right.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>whole lot of meaningless assumptions there, especially considering the ver expert you reference explains it quite well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you wish, please write more about how conspiracy theorists misunderstand or misrepresent;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>well, you misunderstood the paper. That&#39;s clear enough.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>about how all buildings are designed that way or how the Twin&#39;s design was unique;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>i can&#39;t tell you if it was unique. All we know is those <em>exact</em> circumstances have never happened before. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>how they succumbed to the sheer mass from above or how they were so very lightweight, how it was because of planes or fire or momentum and gravity or architectural quirks or plastic buckling or the brittleness of steel;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>why would i explain that? Bazant&#39;s (and others) papers do it quite well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how people are mean and condescending towards you or how they patiently reach out for you as a scientist</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this whole paragraph is condescending. good job</p>

<blockquote>
<p>as a human being, trying to communicate the idea that reason, logic and scientific inquiry dictate skepticism and criticism of the results of the official investigations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>of course, and when they get squashed continuously and thoroughly reason dictates where to look. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So let me spell it out for you: my argument is that if you say Lord Voldemort zapped the Twins from the Death Star to reset the Matrix, you are saner than if you pretend the towers collapsed because Arabs hate our freedom so much.</p>

<p>How could they be missed, they are not there. It is just assumed, never explained - simply derived from the collapse time, that&#39;s all. You learn how to in high school. </p>

<p>Bazant takes care to explain that &quot;What matters is energy, not the strength, nor stiffness.&quot; That&#39;s where Bazant makes the assumption.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A building is not the same in year Y as year Z with respect to loadbearing capability.</p>

<p>So you are saying it decayed from FoS = 2 to FoS = 0.3 (lost more than 75% of its structural integrity) within 30 years <em>without being noticed</em>? </p>

<p>Creep. That one is new. Does that explain FEMAs <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/evidence/metallurgy/images/WTC_apndxC_img_1.jpg">Figure C-1</a> too? /sarcasm</p>

</blockquote>

<p>No, it doesn&#39;t work like in Hollywood movies. </p>

<p>Okay, let&#39;s say it does. That&#39;s what happened to the Twins, then. </p>

<p>Steel, concrete, lots of years, then it&#39;s normal a tower falls to dust like a house of cards in your sunroom. Or like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_Tower_%28Pavia%29">Torre civica di Pavia</a> after a thousand years. Or like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Savar_building_collapse">Rana Plaza</a>, where the aging was simulated with additional weight (floors and machines) and vibrations (from the machines)...</p>

<p>Yay, that explains it :o)</p>

<p>No, it doesn&#39;t. <strong>Creep</strong> is mentioned only as a function of heat in the impact zone (and in conjunction with the Torre civica di Pavia) in Bazants paper <em>and</em> the NIST report. There is no word about signs of a new phenomenon like fast-aged steel. It doesn&#39;t explain how the rest of the structure lost more than 75% of its strength. Or, if it has, how the towers merely shook a little under the impacts of the planes without crumbling to dust instantaneously. You are making things up now, just like predicted. You deviate from the official story. That makes you officially a conspiracy theorist, or, as some prefer to say, a &quot;truther&quot;. </p>

<p>And, by the way, dear random internet stranger: complain some more about condescending. You are given links to click on, sourced claims, patient explanations, logical arguments - while you make wild allegations, perform some quote-mining acrobatics and tell your fellow human to go find his stuff by himself. Disingenuous or bored troll? A little greedy, aren&#39;t we, hmmm? </p>

<p>Or are you having a problem with the Lord Voldemort in a Deathstar resetting the Matrix explanation? That&#39;s okay, replace it to your heart&#39;s content. Imagine the terrorists sneaked all the explosives in hidden in gold bullions. Say it was ripped down by its core by the hands of a huge giant living under the earth. Anything. But get that silly stuff out of your system, that the towers collapsed because they were weak from age, you&#39;re embarrassing yourself. If there was such a new phenomenon like steel &quot;drying out&quot; over the course of 30 years, a lot of old steel buildings would instantly have been reviewed, updated, double-checked, overhauled or simply emergency evacuated and demolished on the spot and students of architecture been told never ever to build a tower like <em>that</em>. </p>

<p>Try reason. Try logic. Try science. </p>
