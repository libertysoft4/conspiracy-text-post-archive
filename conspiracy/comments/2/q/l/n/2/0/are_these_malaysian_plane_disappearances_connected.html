<p>Yes, there is a first time for everything but surely that&#39;s not the only reasoning possible for the flight&#39;s disappearance. If MH370 has taught us anything, there are mysterious forces at work.</p>

Numbers 370, 17 and 8501. When we add it all together we get 8888. It&#39;s 8 repeated 4 times. 8 - 4 is 4.<br/>
When we times that by 2222, we get 8888. Coincidence? 2,2,2,2 and 4 all put together is 12.  We divide that by the letters in Asia which is 4.<br/>
We get 3.
loominaty confirmed.<br/>
/s<br/>
but wait. There is more.<br/>
The 3rd flight disappeared between Indonesia (9 letters) and Singapore(9 letters).<br/>
The 2nd flight crashed in Russia (6 letters).<br/>
The first disappeared in the ocean (5 letters).<br/>
9+9+6+5 = 29. 29 divided by 4 is 7.25, we divide 7.25 by the number of flights that went missing. We get 2 and a half.<br/>
2 and a half men,<br/>
Charlie Sheen was on 2 and a half men,<br/>
Charlie Sheen was on Family Guy<br/>
There are 13 seasons of Family Guy<br/>
13 is a sp00ky number,<br/>

Halloween is on the 31st<br/>
The 31st battalion was an Australian Battleship<br/>
It fought in 1915<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>How&#39;s this for a connection. We are watching the final phase of an operation that&#39;s been going on for many months. The Malaysian flight was a test. Think of it as a dry run to establish stealing an airliner and then making it show up somewhere else without the US intelligence community realizing it had ever happened.</p>

<p>Now we have another flight from the same region that seems to have disappeared. This time the media may even present a convincing story that the crash site has been located. But the real plane itself will show up somewhere else in the coming weeks or months.</p>

<p>At that time, it will appear as a regular flight in someone&#39;s air traffic control system. It&#39;s not unreasonably to be concerned that a nuke might be on board. If something happens after that, everyone&#39;s attention will be focused on North Korea.</p>

<p>Some really nasty people might be able to pull off a very dirty trick. If they are as smart as I think they are, they&#39;ll be the last people in the world that anyone would suspect. Because that&#39;s the way it always happens.</p>

<p>How&#39;s that for a theory?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, just as probable.</p>

<p>Also a little history: Airbus is formerly known as <strong>European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company</strong>, which is the second-largest aerospace company after Boeing and the second-largest arms manufacturer in Europe after BAE Systems.</p>

<p>While the name &quot;Airbus&quot; may sound light and benevolent, their roots are far from it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I placed this in another sub,  so here it is (my two cents and contribution to the conspiracy) </p>

<ul>
<li><p>In February 2014, the UN released the human rights report about conditions in North Korea. The North labeled it as an attack on the government... A month later, MH370 disappeared.</p></li>
<li><p>With the released of The Interview, and the denial of service attack on the North Korean Internet, the North is crying again.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Both Malaysia and Indonesia have working North Korean embassies in their countries. And both are within flying distance to the NK.</p>

<p>I am not saying that NK is responsible but two &quot;major events&quot; involving that country were subsequently followed by a disappearance of an airliner in that geographic area.</p>

<p>But...
Maybe making planes disappear is a way for the NK to to throw a temper tantrum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t any connection. MH370&#39;s disappearance may of been caused by a number of events, but it is presumed lost somewhere in the Indian ocean. MH17 was clearly shot down by pro-Russian separatists whom believed it was a Ukrainian military cargo plane, but realized their mistake afterwards. This recent flight disappearance was most likely because of bad weather. There is no conspiracy going on here and it was all just coincidence that three planes have been lost in one year.  </p>

I&#39;m just trying to do what I can before I got banned for being &quot;off topic.&quot;</p>

<p>You know what. Imma fish up some articles for you.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>MH 17: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/07/20/the-evidence-that-may-prove-pro-russian-separatists-shot-down-mh17/">Here is the best summary</a> on who&#39;s to blame for the plane&#39;s demise. It comes from the unreputable rag known as the <em>Washington Post</em>. I know you won&#39;t believe anything from the &quot;mainstream media&quot;, so I just can&#39;t win on this one no matter how much evidence is put before you. Anyways, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30064374">here is the transcript</a> of pro-Russian sepratists on the ground discovering that the plane they shot down was not a Ukrainian cargo plane as they first suspected, but rather a civilian plane. But hey, can you <em>really</em> believe anything from the BBC?</p>

<p>MH370: You know what, I can&#39;t find the energy in me to restate everything the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370">Wikipedia article can</a>. I can&#39;t put it in better words than they have. Go use your &quot;virtue of free thinking&quot; and poke around those citations at the bottom and see a different side to this than what you&#39;ve read on InfoWars.</p>

<p>As for AirAsia flight QZ8501, information is still coming in, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30614627">but it looks like</a> it was lost to bad weather. (Sorry about using the BBC as a news source; I forgot that they&#39;re owned by the Jews or Bill Gates or something like that.) </p>

<p>Maybe not every major and devastating event that happens is also a conspiracy. <em>But hey, I&#39;m just asking questions here.</em></p>

<p>And lastly, may we remember all the lives that have been lost in these recent tragedies. 239 souls aboard MH370, 298 lives lost aboard MH17, and now 162 more missing on QZ8501. Flight has not come without risk, which just seems all too evident recently...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that the first one disappeared without a trace is nerarious. </p>

<p>That the second one from the same airline was shot down months later is a coincidence unlike any we have seen in aviation history. There is evidence this aircraft was shot down by Ukraine, which means it possibly had a US hand in it, which means the aircraft may have been selected. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How&#39;s this for a connection. We are watching the final phase of an operation that&#39;s been going on for many months. The Malaysian flight was a test. Think of it as a dry run to establish stealing an airliner and then making it show up somewhere else without the US intelligence community realizing it had ever happened.</p>

<p>Now we have another flight from the same region that seems to have disappeared. This time the media may even present a convincing story that the crash site has been located. But the real plane itself will show up somewhere else in the coming weeks or months.</p>

<p>At that time, it will appear as a regular flight in someone&#39;s air traffic control system. It&#39;s not unreasonably to be concerned that a nuke might be on board. If something happens after that, everyone&#39;s attention will be focused on North Korea.</p>

<p>Some really nasty people might be able to pull off a very dirty trick. If they are as smart as I think they are, they&#39;ll be the last people in the world that anyone would suspect. Because that&#39;s the way it always happens.</p>
