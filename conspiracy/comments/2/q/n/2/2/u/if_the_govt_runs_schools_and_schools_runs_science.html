    <div class="md"><p>I would just like to say that most research is not reproducible by anyone. Your little parentheses won&#39;t save you here. The proper materials are often traveling across the globe, million dollars of lab equipment, or months of conducting surveys and studies. Few results actually get replicated. The ones that do fall into a category I call &quot;the circle of science.&quot; That is to say science based on science loses some of its solid credibility. Take this relationship a few more times down the chain and all modern science is at best speculation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely! Very good.</p>

<p>Hot water freezes faster than cold water under some conditions, surprising, but verifiable!</p>

<p>Also be careful, when you say a decent chunk of the scientific community that still doesn&#39;t incorporate even a small portion of everyone else. Remember, scientists rely on the approval and support of other scientists for peer reviewed publication so they certainly do not want to cause any problems. </p>

<p>More importantly, the big issues: global warming and whatnot, are must less verifiable and have the biggest affect on legislation and international affairs.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that&#39;s not what actually happens. What happens is, if they don&#39;t like your research, its suppressed. Suppression can occur via journal rejection, funding withdrawal, blacklisting of your lab requiring your dismissal, and so on. Which means your scientific career is over.</p>

<p>If you look at the leaked emails of pro-climate change scientists you can verify they conspired to force journals to not publish alternative explanations or data interpretations and that all alternate explanations were not to be tolerated. They also argued over how best to manipulate data to make it most damming, supporting with their agenda.</p>

<p>Look at LENR. Validated by the DoD, DARPA, and over two hundred labs now. MIT committed scientific fraud. Pons and Fleischmann&#39;s careers were destroyed for being correct, having never violated scientific tenets, and not a single investigation has been initiated against the worst crime possible in science - against MIT.</p>

<p>Science is easily corrupted and there are examples to be found for over a hundred years now. History is like science in that the victorious establishment write canon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it wasn&#39;t. MIT stated it was fraud yet validated the experiment. They reported failure having never checked their experiment. A graph in their formal paper ( buried ) confirms a positive result. They touted death of LENR, via an actual party, immediately after starting their experiment. The level of scientific fraud and misconduct is amazing. Go learn before you continue to prove your fingers are faster than your brain. </p>

<p>Or are you saying you know better than thousands of scientists and hundreds of labs (including biggest names in physics). Even CalTech, one of the original antagonists have backtracked, admitted they incorrectly followed instructions (plus calibration errors) and now formally teach LENR.</p>

<p>Your information is as invalid as it is three decades stale. Congrats, you&#39;ve been played as an obedient sucker.</p>

<p>Wrong. They are places where people with incredibly more qualifications review their peer work. Their work as always includes their evidence and method. If its rejected its not because it goes against the grain its because its not substantiated. Much like your claims. </p>

<p>I see where you are coming from, but you can&#39;t just redefine the words I am using underneath me. When I say scientists I mean anyone on the pursuit of truth. You and I apply.</p>

<p>Says the man who just redefined scientist to mean anyone. Pardon me if I ignore the rest of your drivel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can call the people you are talking about as mainstream scientists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No they are actual scientists. Period.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So on to my primary complaint:</p>

<p>These mainstream scientists cannot support, review, or otherwise accept any kind of research that proposes that the government is not necessary, that global warming is a problem we must curb our consumer habits to prevent, and a myriad of other non-truths. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you stupid enough to think climate change isn&#39;t happening or are you saying the government silences research saying that the government isn&#39;t the solution? Both are equally retarded i just want to know which kind of stupid you are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is because the grants that give mainstream scientists their livings are facilitated by the government.</p>

<p>Again. You are somehow delusional enough to think our single government is conspiring to silence scientists world wide</p>

<p>You are clearly a member of the laity of the science faith.

<p>The only thing you demonstrate with this statement is how limited your own imaginative capacity is with respect to the discussion. It needn&#39;t be all. Ideologies can spread intentionally or organically and have real world consequences for the institutions through which they spread. In the case of gate-keeper academic institutions ideologies become the framework in which questions can be asked and the corresponding framework in which data is analyzed and modeled. Kuhn wrote about the subject extensively in &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are certainly not. Neither am I. That&#39;s a very specific label with real world qualifications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Real qualifications given out by a real board members that were given the ability to dictate rational versus irrational lines of inquiry within their chosen fields from on high. Real men of distinguishment and learning steadfastly dedicated to propagating the faith in its orthodox form to the masses of today. The proud and singular practitioners of Real Science carrying the torch of enlightenment against the dark black ignorant masses of pseudo-scientific heretics and filthy backward pagans.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its accepted because of their qualifications and the evidence brought forth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Proud we faithful are of our true mastery of that most holy rational structure, the circle. Woven deeply into the very logic of our credo is the great looped form of the most high shape, the circular. Here then, an ouroboros convinced of its reality by the rapidity with which it swallows its ta(il|le).</p>

<p>Think of all the people diagnosed with cancer every year that strap themselves up to the chemo drip and die.

<p>There are valid alternatives, people are actually curing cancer, but they can&#39;t get it out to the people because of the FDA and the Rockefeller&#39;s and their inability to get funding without their consent.

    <div class="md"><p>Money is the problem dude. You cant live free and equal with money, because if I have more money than you, my life is worth more than yours, im worth more and I can have things you can&#39;t. If a swat team had time to save either a wage slave,  or a multimillionaire in a hostage situation, what order would be given on which life to prioritize?  There can be no equality or freedom with money, because when people have more money, they have more power. And with enough power, they can rule. And are ruling us right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like what you&#39;ve got here, but I do not agree that everyone needs to be equal. This is kind of a ridiculous goal and the only way we would have it is if there was one person on the planet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, and to motivate these people to these positions we should give them more resources.</p>

<p>Simply, why should the guy whose job it is to clean floors 12-16 of an office building the same resources as someone who manages a farming company that gets food to 100 million people nationwide?</p>

<p>What is important are two things:</p>

<p>1) the janitor, had he worked hard on the goal of feeding 100 million people, should have been born with the potential to be in the CEOs shoes.</p>

<p>2) the additional resources the CEO procures should be directly proportional to the additional help he is doing. Clearly the guy isn&#39;t picking every crop his company sells, but he is a vital instrument in its organization. The proper price can only be realized when the market for CEOs becomes more competitive. </p>
