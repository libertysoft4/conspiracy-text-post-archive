    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Running scared?&quot; In case you may have missed it, your so-called crisis actors just filed a suit against Bushmaster. Now why would they expose themselves to the discovery process of a lawsuit deliberately if they were so &quot;scared&quot;? You think Bushmaster isn&#39;t going to do everything in their power to avoid having to pay a hefty settlement? But when someone mentions the lawsuit against Bushmaster you guys get real quiet all of sudden, because it doesn&#39;t fit your &quot;hoax&quot; narrative at all. Strange huh?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re filing the suit as part of their gun-control initiative, which <em>does</em> fit the narrative that the event was orchestrated in favor of gun control. I mean, if they&#39;re not paid gun control lobbyists, why are those idiots suing Bushmaster for the acts allegedly committed by a crazed gunman in the first place? Who are they going to sue next? The company that made his sneakers or his car? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they anticipate to win their case, because it&#39;s inherently absurd. They are not afraid of any &#39;discovery process&#39; because Bushmaster won&#39;t have to try very hard to win the case. Like, duh?</p>

<p>It&#39;s incredible how shameless they have been in pursuing this political agenda in the wake of the alleged deaths of their children. And yes I do think they are afraid of the truth surrounding Sandy Hook coming out, primarily because they know it was a sloppy and brazen operation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no precedent in American history for successfully suing a gun manufacturer for something like this. Unless the gun had a manufacturer&#39;s defect that resulted in the deaths of those children, they are simply not responsible. It&#39;s a frivolous case filed in order to get attention in the news media, they won&#39;t actually win the case. </p>

<p>At any rate, the reason I think you&#39;re stupid and haven&#39;t thought this through is because you haven&#39;t even considered what a PR disaster it would be for Bushmaster to claim that Sandy Hook was a hoax as their defense. Like seriously, are you really <em>that</em> stupid? The Bushmaster lawyers are simply going to argue that their guns work as designed, they are legally manufactured and distributed, and there are volumes upon volumes of laws and policy that state that gun manufacturer&#39;s are not responsible for their misuse in the hands of others. In other words, &quot;Guns don&#39;t kill people, people kill people.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A &quot;PR disaster&quot;? For a gun company? Whose guns were used in a mass shooting of children? Yeah, I&#39;m sure they care more about PR than their bottom line. LOL Clearly they are in the feel-good business. Besides, all they would have to prove is that THEIR gun wasn&#39;t used in THIS shooting and the case would be dismissed. They wouldn&#39;t have to go into all the other details about a supposed hoax. The public would do the rest once it was proven in open court that this gun wasn&#39;t used because this incident didn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>FYI, ad hominem attacks weaken your argument significantly. So does the fact that you can&#39;t seem to distinguish a civil suit from proposed legislation, i.e. &quot;They&#39;re filing the suit as part of their gun-control initiative&quot;. A civil suit has nothing to do with gun control laws, it&#39;s about monetary compensation. </p>

<p>PR is often directly related to the bottom line you simpleton. Bushmaster isn&#39;t going to open themselves up to more bad PR in the midst of this. </p>

<p>No it&#39;s about attention in the news media, as I already pointed out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Attention in the news media to what end? When the 40 proposed gun control laws that cropped up in the wake of this incident have already been defeated? This incident is old news. And most people don&#39;t care about the PR of the company that made their gun, unless that PR states that the guns are defective. If the gun functions as desired that is all they need to know. The companies donations to &quot;save the whales&quot; are not considered by buyers when picking out an assault rifle. In fact, the fact that the gun functioned the way that it did is a <em>selling</em> point.</p>

<p>You might only be 15, but even so, I&#39;m still not going to give you a pass for your juvenile behavior and put up with name calling. I&#39;m done interacting with you. </p>

<p>EDIT: 40 proposed in Connecticut ALONE after the first year - for all states, the total proposed was about 1500, and the total that became law was 109. Of those 109, 70 actually LOOSENED gun restrictions.

<p>Yeah, shameless that parents whose children were gunned down at school by a mentally-disturbed young man should now be strongly in support of gun control. Who would expect that? /s</p>

<p>Of course, unlike you imply, the parents <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/29/us/connecticut-sandy-hook-hearings/index.html">don&#39;t speak with one voice</a>. Mark Mattioli, the parent of James, for example, spoke <strong>against</strong> additional gun control legislation, &quot;I don&#39;t care if you named it &#39;James&#39; law,&#39; I don&#39;t want (another law). I think there&#39;s much more promise for a solution in identifying, researching and creating solutions along the lines of mental health.&quot;</p>

<p>I mean, y&#39;know, considering that a few men, in the &#39;60s, with the technology of a pocket calculator, landed men on the moon...there&#39;s no way that a Sandy Hook couldn&#39;t have been staged.</p>

And it also won&#39;t fit the narrative once the families lose the lawsuit (as they will - people sue gun manufacturers after mass shooting events ALL THE TIME and they lose) and it again stamps out any idea of gun control.  However, this suit has nothing to do with gun control.  In fact, the whole reason there is a lawsuit in the first place is because legislators neglected to pass any real gun control laws after the shooting, despite an overwhelming majority of Americans supporting things such as the Universal background check (as I suppose they would have if this was a staged event to force gun control).  This is a civil suit.  If the families win it will only get them money.  This has nothing to do with legislation and no gun control will come of this either way.  This suit does nothing but peck away at the idea that this whole event was a hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. At this point, if people had the evidence they claim to show that those people ARE crisis actors, we&#39;d have real names now, and be able to IMDB them/actually fact check it. The good thing about this court case is, it does exactly what you said it will. Debunk the theory. It already has in some small ways. No gun control legislation will come of it, and it&#39;s a civil matter. They&#39;re suing for money for the families. Not suing the state. Also, they&#39;d be forced to use their real name in court, and if they didn&#39;t, that&#39;s filing a false instrument, and perjury. The case will go nowhere, as cases like this never do. If there were really crisis actors, this Bushmaster lawsuit would surely expose them all. Defense would expose that all day long in court, and have it thrown out in minutes. </p>

<p>I mean, unless you&#39;re totally dedicated to the fact the whole thing is staged, and there were crisis actors, and willing to say that of course the judge and the court will have been staged, or paid off, or actors aswell, then admit you have no concrete evidence to support your narrative, because I know you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>I think that, because of all our government had done wrong, and covered up (JFK, Area 51, Boston Bombing, 9/11), that they now are just ready and willing to accept they are behind anything, and just use whatever shoddy evidence is presented, like Sandy Hook crisis actors, cause they know not to believe the common narrative. Only problem is, when the evidence supports the common narrative, it only emboldens them. </p>

<p>According to the official story: Somewhere between 10:10-10:20 ( could be noon ) the children were evacuated from the school.

<p>But since you asked, the evidence I have is a group of parents that you think are &quot;crisis actors&quot; has filed a suit against the gun company which will have to stand up to the judicial standard of proof in court.

<p>They claim that these weapons are unfit for civilian use, yet they apparently have no qualms about militarized state-side police being equipped with these types of firearms. Does it not seem reasonable to you that within the years leading to 2012 and since there has been a massive influx of these type of shooting situations pushed by the media? It reeks of public consciousness manipulation to me. They are trying to sue a gun company for making guns that some supposed nut killed a bunch of people with? You don&#39;t see car companies getting sued very often when someone is the victim of a hit and run. . . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;In recent years, many top-selling brands — including the 195-year-old Remington Arms, as well as Bushmaster Firearms and DPMS, leading makers of military-style semiautomatics — have quietly passed into the hands of a single private company. It is called the Freedom Group — and it is the most powerful and mysterious force in the American commercial gun industry today.&quot; (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/business/how-freedom-group-became-the-gun-industrys-giant.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/business/how-freedom-group-became-the-gun-industrys-giant.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0</a>) </p>

<p>I do not see a company this powerful taking it up the butt to help cover up a conspiracy that potentially has the power to reduce its annual market share even further. Remember, politicians don&#39;t run the government anymore - <em>corporations</em> do. If there was anything fraudulent about Sandy Hook, Freedom Group lawyers and PI&#39;s would rip that shit to shreds.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve obviously never worked on EMS before.

Rule #1 of EMS is that the safety of the crew is more important than the safety of the patients. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So much wrong in this. Just to take your first five points</p>

<p>1) Not a &quot;drill&quot;. A training class. 20 miles away from the school. Which had also happened on multiple previous occasions that month. </p>

<p>2) Per the police report, &quot;EMS was staging off-site until the scene was secure.&quot; Police officers helped carry the wounded out to the EMS staging area.</p>

<p>3) <a href="http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1537330!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_970/451957081.jpg">Factually incorrect</a></p>

<p>4) They did ID them, from photographs - which seems a perfectly sensible and compassionate approach given Lanza shot each victim up to 11 times. [Edit: And one <a href="https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/icrc-002-0880.pdf">promoted by the Red Cross</a> in their guidelines for the management of dead bodies after disasters. In the section, &quot;Identification and release of body to relatives&quot;, it says: &quot;The psychological impact of viewing dozens or hundreds of dead bodies may further reduce the validity of visual recognition. <strong>Viewing photographs of the highest possible quality may be a better approach.</strong>&quot;]</p>

<p>5) Factually incorrect. New security <strong>procedures</strong>, not hardware. There was only one camera at the school, so staff could buzz visitors in, and it had no recording capability. Show me evidence otherwise. </p>

<p>[Edit] 6) Chalk Hill school was all but closed years earlier, in May 2010, <a href="http://aspwebsitedesigns.com/move/?p=419">for entirely legitimate budgetary reasons</a></p>

<p>I could go on. But the Hoax theory requires a very paranoid interpretation of data that, inevitably, has a perfectly reasonable explanation, combined with flat-out factual errors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch the entire video. The evidence is laid out pretty clearly. You have not addressed any of the major evidence whatsoever, which leads me to assume that you either glossed over/skipped through the video, or you did not actually watch it.</p>

<p>I am not going to do their work twice.</p>

<p>Where do you sit in the whole conspiracy theory spectrum? Everything is connected. And it will be impossible to change your mind or alter your view until you yourself make a conscious decision to start doing your own research. What kind of person are you that you will deny a claim, but refuse to prove it wrong yourself?</p>

<p>Once again, I am not doing somebody else&#39;s exhaustive research twice. There is plenty of information out there, and it is your choice to remain in the dark.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You could also tell me the Easter Bunny exists. But I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to require multiple, verifiable sources for that as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that is incomparable. The Easter Bunny does not exist. While there is truckloads of evidence for you to sift through, and systematically prove wrong, before we can even have a fair debate on the subject. The only thing you have on your side currently is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kip2w-DceV0&amp;amp;t=2m30s">American Media Narrative</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did watch the entire video, Yes, the evidence was &quot;laid out pretty clearly&quot; - but, to me, was then found wanting, either being the result of shoddy investigative work and/or having credible alternative, non-hoax explanations. I&#39;ve already given plenty of examples thereof. Your contrasting refusal (not uncommon among hoax theorists, I&#39;ve found) to provide and stand behind a single piece of evidence is, I think, quite enlightening. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where do you sit in the whole conspiracy theory spectrum?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>12 words or less? Hanlon&#39;s Razor: &quot;Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.&quot; In this case, the simple idiocy of letting a mentally-disturbed young man have copious access to lethal weapons. Conspiracy should very rarely be the first impulse, with people then somehow required to disprove this. Also, &quot;extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,&quot; and the idea of this being a hoax, without precedent in American history, is certainly a very, very extraordinary claim. The evidence for it? Far from extraordinary. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So, I&#39;ll ask again. Give me the best single point from this &quot;major evidence&quot; that supports the hoax narrative, and we&#39;ll talk. But actually, there are thousands of pages of words, pictures and other documentation in the official report, all of it virtually 100% consistent with the standard narrative. The hoax theory seems to offer precious little which doesn&#39;t fall apart, or have an alternative explanation, when given adequate scrutiny. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t say what anyone &quot;thought&quot;, obviously. But regardless of what you think, there is no apparent evidence which says there <strong>were</strong> any cameras in the school, no. Not one of the 600 pupils, their families, teachers, staff, or anyone else who had ever been in the school, has suggested otherwise. To me, it makes the whole &quot;no video footage&quot; thing entirely explicable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, one can conclude that there were no cameras if after all this time something as important as footage isn&#39;t mentioned in the evidence. Which then leads one to wonder why there wouldn&#39;t be any. You have to ask yourself, why wouldn&#39;t anyone think to include something as important as recording cameras within the school? I&#39;m not trying to advocate that Sandy Hook is a hoax, but there&#39;s a lot of stuff that&#39;s stupid when you think about it that kinda makes you wonder, you know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Per <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=334">this report</a> on school safety and security measures, in the 2011-12 session, only 64% of all public schools reported using security cameras. However, there does also appear to be significant variation by grade. <a href="http://www.nasponline.org/advocacy/schoolsecurity.pdf">This report</a>, from a couple of years earlier, gives rates of 84% for high schools, but dropping sharply to barely half (51%) of elementary/primary schools. So, there isn&#39;t really anything particularly unusual about the lack of cameras: especially in an older facility like Sandy Hook, it&#39;s likely par for the course. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>right so what they are saying with columbine though, is that its more akin to Aurora, where everyone knows the shooting DID happen. It&#39;s just the details on there being more than the stated number of shooters...such as black ops handlers. We have the 2 main people though, on camera at the scene.</p>

<p>With sandy hook, the conspiracy is that no shooting ever in fact took place at all. It&#39;s a brazen thing to say someone did something, then not show a picture of him doing it if you have one. My thoughts are, if they DID have one, they would show it. Just like columbine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another great point. The Sandy Hucksters would like us to believe that the government moved all these &quot;actors&quot; in to free government-gifted homes in Sandy Hook (not a cheap place to live BTW) YEARS before this occurred, and ostensibly paid all the utilities, upkeep and taxes on the &quot;actors&quot; homes, and is STILL doing so, and will likely have to do so for the rest of their lives. Add to that the expense of paying the &quot;actors&quot; salaries at their fake jobs for decades, plus all the other payoffs, hush money and subterfuge that supposedly went into this. All told, we are talking about millions upon millions of dollars in reoccurring expenses. </p>

<p>And for what? nearly 2/3 of state laws passed since Newtown actually INCREASED the rights of gun owners (<a href="http://www.guns.com/2013/12/12/most-gun-laws-passed-since-sandy-hook-have-loosened-restrictions/">http://www.guns.com/2013/12/12/most-gun-laws-passed-since-sandy-hook-have-loosened-restrictions/</a>).

    <div class="md"><p>remember Newtown is not a normal town, its some form of govt town, the CT state prison is there and likely WPP refuge too. a very unusual bump of hundreds of extra house sales in 2012, people out of Newtown.</p>

<p>then theres the $0 mortgage or whatever xmas day house sales.</p>

<p>the (East Coast) second office for the Church of Satan is in Newtown, assorted masonic lodges, then theres the building known or promoted as SHES, not a normal school building, more likley it was some form of teaching hospital school, the round door windows and the extreme tiling in the corridors, not a single locker to be seen in the hallways either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off you stated no opinions. Obviously from the words you used &quot;hoping&quot; it is more based on feeling and emotion than critically gathered and provided materials. I never claimed to be a patriot and I do not know whether this event actually happened. I have not seen the bodies and frankly most of the reports I have seen, especially in the MSM are virtually identical. The points and inconsistencies that many people who research this proposed event are much more convincing to me, and frankly I would go so far as to demand the US government answer and explain these issues. Wasting resources on this fools folly? Sorry but Sandy Hook is likely to have direct impact on MY 2nd amendment, therefore effects me directly and I WILL not let my privacy be trampled by weak, insecure, and scared sheep and anyone who wants to try can come find me.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a homework assignment for you: Find out just how many pieces of gun control legislation were proposed as a result of SH, and then find out how many of them were ever actually passed into law. </p>

<p>And about that whole &quot;second amendment&quot; thing - that amendment was passed with the intention of making sure that a tyrannical government would not be able to overtake the unarmed citizenry. Sadly, it&#39;s not applicable anymore. Not because the government is trustworthy, mind you, but because when that amendment was written, military might had yet to to pass beyond the level of a few muskets, and citizens actually stood a chance. Let&#39;s face it: if the National Guard decides to roll tanks down your street tonight, what good do you think that little rifle is <em>really</em> going to do you? They&#39;d quickly make an example of you and reduce you, your guns, and your family in the house behind you to a greasy spot on your driveway, and then your second-amendment-happy neighbors would think better of making the same mistake and put down their guns as well. You know it, and I know it.  The truth, my friend, is that <em>a tyrannical government has ALREADY been able to overtake the un(der)armed citizenry</em>. </p>

<p>It&#39;s too late, buddy. That ship has sailed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because someone is of fighting age doesn&#39;t mean they are fit to take up arms and fight the government. Look around you, at the people you know, and ask yourself - who among you is going to risk losing their family and everything they love to fight the military? And of those, how many will <em>still</em> feel that way after watching an entire neighborhood die a gruesome death writing in pain from the effects of Sarin/VX gas? </p>

<p>It&#39;s a huge gamble at best and an unfounded assumption that &quot;much of the military will switch sides&quot;. History has shown us that the military will follow orders even when they morally disagree with those orders. Especially when the safety of their own is at stake. Those carrying out these orders will have been promised safety for those they love, bet on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An &quot;active shooter&quot; who committed suicide? Does not seem like he would be very active to me. . . Furthermore once the scene was secured why were they EMS not allowed to proceed?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care about the Sydney Siege, I live in America.</p>

<p>According to the official story: Somewhere between 10:10-10:20 ( could be noon ) the children were evacuated from the school. If the children were being evacuated then there must be enough evidence to reasonably believe the scene was secured. Yet still the EMS were blocked even during and after this time. </p>

<p>EDIT: 10 Am is the reported evacuation time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;In recent years, many top-selling brands — including the 195-year-old Remington Arms, as well as Bushmaster Firearms and DPMS, leading makers of military-style semiautomatics — have quietly passed into the hands of a single private company. It is called the Freedom Group — and it is the most powerful and mysterious force in the American commercial gun industry today.&quot; (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/business/how-freedom-group-became-the-gun-industrys-giant.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/business/how-freedom-group-became-the-gun-industrys-giant.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0</a>) </p>

<p>I do not see a company this powerful taking it up the butt to help cover up a conspiracy that potentially has the power to reduce its annual market share even further. Remember, politicians don&#39;t run the government anymore - <em>corporations</em> do. If there was anything fraudulent about Sandy Hook, Freedom Group lawyers and PI&#39;s would rip that shit to shreds.</p>
