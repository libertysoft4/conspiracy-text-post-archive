<p>I&#39;m sure footage does exist in some classified archive and I don&#39;t accept that the entire surveillance system malfunctioned.  Far too convenient and far too important a building.</p>

<p>Nobody appears to have filmed the actual fly-over or impact with a handheld camcorder or similar, as it&#39;s not really a tourist area and nobody would think to do so (unlike Manhattan which is crawling with tourists).  In the case of New York that cat was never in the bag.</p>

<p>So, why wouldn&#39;t they suppress footage of the planes...</p>

<p>Perhaps, to some observers the MSM and others in Power, have indeed <em>suppressed</em> footage necessary to do a complete investigation of the <em>Twin Tower</em> events. </p>

<p>Not saying <em>No Planes</em>! Just saying video from all the Private Owned Properties leased to <em>News Sites</em> that had often <em>aired</em> from strategic locations (For Good Morning New York...)  had <em>no feed</em> that morning, countless helicopters both Police and News in the air failed, also the footage that did air, lost all the background of the <em>skyline</em> on a clear bright blue sky day, long before smoke obstructed other video footage shot by ordinary citizens from various vantage points.</p>

<p>The Naudet Film of 9/11 is alleged proof, for many of the first plane. I&#39;m personally not convinced that what they claim to have filmed is actually what struck the first tower.</p>

<p>The second <em>plane</em> should have had Video, Photo shots up the wazoo...</p>

<p>No plane hit WTC7. Correct? </p>

<p>No plane hit WTC6. Right?</p>

<p>WTC6 has a crater in the middle of it! Fucker didn&#39;t fall down. </p>

<p>Check out 4 &amp; 5 as well because these buildings were severely deformed and didn&#39;t fall down.</p>

I&#39;m on the west coast, so I&#39;m not worth much on specifics on the east coast. I&#39;ve found launch sites at the beach out here, though. Just a giant hinged manhole cover in a little valley, fenced off with &quot;do not enter&quot;, etc. 9/11 was carried out during multiple military drills, so a &quot;simulated&quot; launch would not be very suspect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. I don&#39;t think bush would have anything to do with it directly. Cheney and Rumsfeld and all the DOD neocons? Sure. If running a response simulation, you follow protocol. If the reponse simulation is all fucked up (as it was on 9/11) then all bets are off. A pentagon strike on 9/11 would be similar to setting a building on fire and robbing the bank across the street. But in this case, they got rid of a shitload of budgeting paperwork that could potentially destroy the presidency and have huge implications for US military power across the world. Pointing out lives lost has no weight when discussing warmongers. It&#39;s just not relevant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was on the exact opposite side of the building. What makes this whole plane theory even more ridiculous is the way the plane apparently descended and eventually hit the pentagon. If a hijacker wanted effect maximum damage he would of hit the roof which was a much much bigger target then that tiny section that was damaged. Experienced pilots with thousands of hours in flight time said that hitting where that plane hit was borderline impossible.</p>

<p>The locations of the different offices around the pentagon are public knowledge and if a would be terrorist wanted to inflict maximum damage they would&#39;ve hit where the joint chefs offices are.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Questions we would all love the answer to. </p>

<p>If you look at a lot of events, all we know is that the official story doesn&#39;t add up. When things happen for real, it is obvious. If Bin Laden was behind 9/11, you can bet he would have released a high definition victory speech video letting the world know of his greatest success. </p>

<p>Do we have that? No. We have video of him denying the attack. Then we have grainy, potato quality video of someone who looks nothing like Bin Laden, yet we are told <em>is</em>  Bin Laden, claiming responsibility. </p>

<p>Authorities would have released video of all the hijackers at airports. Do we have that? No. We have many of the supposed hijackers turning up still alive around the world. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t pretend to have all the answers, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that the official story <em>doesn&#39;t add up</em>.</p>

<p>The cab driver outside the pentagon admits he is part of a &#39;rich peoples plan&#39; that he didnt want to be a part of. But he&#39;s stuck in it now. </p>

<p>How they do these things while keeping most people quiet is a mystery to me. I think the CIA hypnosis and mind control program is a part of it- look up MK Ultra and project Open Eyes. And yes, we have official documents that these projects exist. They receive millions of dollars of funding, so mind control is not some crazy thing paranoid conspiracy theorists just came up with. If the CIA takes it seriously, you better take it seriously. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know where 70 people went they could&#39;ve easily never been real people to begin with. It&#39;s so easy to make up a fake profile and back story.

My own two cents begins with the fact that the pentagon is the most protected building in the world in the most restricted and protected airspace in the world.

Not to mention Andrews air force base is right outside of DC and it would&#39;ve taken a jet fighter minutes to reach DC airspace. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well 70 is a really small number. There a about 360 million Americans as of the last census. I do not know how many people are in witness protection but I&#39;m going to take a guess and it&#39;s well over 70. </p>

<p>With out asking where the plane went you have to look at the logistics. On a airplane the weakest and lightest part is the haul aka where you sit. The heaviest and strongest parts are the wings and engine. The official narrative makes the assertion that a weak airplane haul smashed through layers of reinforced concrete and metal while the wings and engine didn&#39;t even make it through the outer wall. </p>

<p>Where did the plane go? Where did those people go? I don&#39;t know, but I do know around 100,000 kids are kidnapped without a trace each year. It&#39;s a big country and if you know the right techniques you can make a measly 70 people disappear that is if such a plane ever existed. </p>

<p>just curious, what is your profession?  other then your HS physics class, would you consider yourself some sort of expert that is smarter then the average american?  (I will grant you however that the avg american is not that bright)</p>

<p>it was actually flying at 530 mph with plenty of debris and burning fuel that lasted for hours.</p>

<p>yes I do. there is a mountain of evidence to support this. biggest being the plane is actually no longer in existence. and neither are all the people who were on board. was at I at Dulles that morning to watch it take off? no I wasnt. but I&#39;ve never seen the pyramids in egypt with my own eyes either yet I know they exist.</p>

<p>that looks like some ones blog and again most of the bits were able to fit in buckets? ffs what happened to the massive car sized engines that would have been 10-15 ft further out to the side of that minuscule hole. those engines can not possibly disintegrate on impact.</p>

<p>okay so here is where it falls apart 530 mph iirc is beyond the max speed those planes are even capable of with out ripping the wings off and thats ignoring the sheer forces that are going to be buffeting those wings at that height. if it were an airliner the Fuel burning off would have torched the whole god damn pentagon 
for example. 
 for whatever reason youtube and google are down where i am (wtf) ill link a video of a 757 crashing (or hell any real airliner) which makes the claim that it was a plane absolutely ridiculous</p>

<p>First off, how do you know this?  second of all, Penatgon is a very big building and like I said, fires raged.  you can find more detail here <a href="http://www.fireengineering.com/articles/print/volume-155/issue-11/features/the-pentagon-attack-on-9-11-arlington-county-va-fire-department-response.html">http://www.fireengineering.com/articles/print/volume-155/issue-11/features/the-pentagon-attack-on-9-11-arlington-county-va-fire-department-response.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>okay so the top speed of an aircraft is while at cruising altitude the closer they are to the ground the thicker the air and the higher the resistance.</p>

<p>609 is nearly the speed of sound at sealevel and that would tear the wings clear off if it could even reach that speed in the thicker air </p>

<p>and the link for fire requires a login im not saying there wasn&#39;t fire im saying if it was an actual airliner the fire ball would have been nearly the size of the pentagon (yes i know how big it is) the planes were nearly full having just taken off in most cases (not sure about 77)</p>

<p>how could the planes that hit the buildings have enough fuel that burns a 900 ish degrees to melts steel ( melting point 1700 degrees) yet the one that smashed in to the pentagon had barely enough to singe the exterior of the building? </p>

<p>I was simply pointing out to you that you were wrong about the top speed of the aircraft.  as I said, according to  wiki (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_77">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_77</a>) the plane was going 535mph at impact.  The speed of sound is 761mph.  so not only are you wrong on many fronts, you arent really making a point.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>again.  how do you know this? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>yet the one that smashed in to the pentagon had barely enough to singe the exterior of the building? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>are you serious? The crash and subsequent fire penetrated three outer ring sections of the western side. The outermost ring section was largely destroyed, and a large section collapsed.  thats a little more than &quot;singeing the exterior&quot;.</p>

<p>I feel like we arent even discussing the same incident. </p>

<p>in the strictest sense, you raise a good point, they pyramids may not. I would assume the retort would be that there doesn&#39;t seem to be any significant impact in believing or otherwise in the pyramids. Those who believe flight 77 never existed however would possibly suggest that the pentagon being attacked served a wider purpose of augmenting the industrial military complex and laid ground work for 10-20 years of Middle eastern war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, i do not think the us government is capable of firing a missile into their own headquarters while at the same time make 70 random Americans disappear from an airplane.
