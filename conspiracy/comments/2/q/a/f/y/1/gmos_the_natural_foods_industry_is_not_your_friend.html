        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/12/22/gmos-the-natural-foods-industry-is-not-your-friend/">From Jon Rappoport</a>:</p>

<p>If Monsanto, its allies, and dupes have their way, this is what is going to happen:</p>

<p>A federal law will be passed, canceling the right of individual states and counties to ban or label GMOs. Companies and retailers will be permitted to voluntarily label their food products “non-GMO,” if they use approved labs for testing.</p>

<p>The obvious consequence? We will eternally co-exist with Monsanto and the other biotech giants. More GMO foods, more toxic pesticides.</p>

<p>The not-so obvious consequence? Paying several thousand dollars per product for testing and certification, some large companies in the natural-food industry will label their products “non-GMO,” thus creating an elite sanctuary for those consumers who can afford to shop at high prices.</p>

<p>And by the way, many of those non-GMO products won’t be organic.</p>

<p>For centuries, the poorest peasants ate non-GMO non-pesticide food. Now that will become a privilege for the relatively few.</p>

<p>Are there certain players in the natural-food industry who look forward to such an arrangement?</p>

<p>See The Food Navigator, 19 December, 2014, <a href="http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Suppliers2/5-GMO-food-myths-dispelled">“5 GMO myths dispelled.”</a> This magazine is the number-one staple for people in the natural-foods biz.</p>

<p>The article reports on a <a href="http://www.npainfo.org/">Natural Products Association</a> webinar. The NPA is a huge trade group for the natural products industry.</p>

<p>The article states that, during the webinar, the NPA made room for a speaker, Greg Jaffe, from the <a href="http://www.cspinet.org/">Center for Science in the Public Interest</a> (CSPI).</p>

<p>A lawyer, Jaffe (<a href="http://www.cspinet.org/about/cspi_staff.html">bio here</a>) has logged stints with the EPA, FDA, DOJ, and World Bank—all groups that, in one way or another, have vigorously supported GMOs.</p>

<p>Jaffe proceeded to make a case for GMOs, “dispelling the myths” prevalent in the anti-GMO community.</p>

<p>This fact alone is highly significant. You have the leading magazine and the leading trade group for the natural products industry giving a heavy wink and nod to GMO foods.</p>

<p>According to the article, Jaffe explained that the process of using bacteria to carry foreign genes into a food plant is really quite natural. Which is like saying that a glass eye is natural.</p>

<p>Then Jaffe presents the tired generality: “Evidence is overwhelming that there is no harm from foods made from current GE [genetic engineered] foods.” As “evidence,” he cites the FDA approval of biotech crops. The FDA—<a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/12/18/monsanto-science-and-fraud-are-the-same-thing/">which has basically stated that Monsanto, Dow, and the other mega-giants are responsible for assuring the safety of GMOs.</a></p>

<p>Notice again, all this cover for GMOs is being presented in a trade magazine vis-a-vis a trade group for the natural food products industry.</p>

<p>So yes, there are certainly players in the natural-foods business who would welcome a) co-existing with Monsanto, b) letting a law pass that would eradicate the possibility of GMO bans or required labels anywhere in the US, and c) use that situation to establish their own voluntary labeling programs (“this product is non-GMO”).</p>

<p>That last step would allow them to create a whole raft of elite food products for affluent customers, thus inflating their $$ bottom lines.</p>

<p>And in the process, with their bright shiny “non GMO” labels, they would essentially downgrade and partially obscure the organic food producers, which is to say the people who grow crops as they were grown for thousands of years, before the pesticide and GMO industries came into being.</p>

<p>Monsanto would win, the natural-food sellers would win, and we would lose.</p>

<p>The final coup de grace? Up the line, a federal regulation stating that the presence of GMOs in food is no deterrent to labeling that food product Organic.</p>

<p>End-game; especially since power players in the natural foods industry would have no objection.</p>

<p>With enemies like these, who needs more enemies?</p>

<p>Guess that&#39;s just the way it is with big-agro?</p>
