        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>something is bothering me. in 1999 when i was in the 4th grade in a small new hampshire town that i had just moved to, some outside teachers from our class wheeled a tv in and showed my class an animation that was pretty disturbing and asked us to tell them what it meant.</p>

<p>since then i haven&#39;t been able to find this animation despite hours of searching the internet and i need to see it again.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t remember much but here&#39;s what i can remember:</p>

<p>the style was minimalist and similar to how most political cartoons are drawn.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t remember there being dialogue</p>

<p>i remember part of the story was this young boy having a board strapped to his head, the adult (parent?) always tying the board tighter, looked painful. when the board finally came off later on, it was a mold of the bottom of a shoe. i remember another adult coming to the boy and fitting his shoe in the imprint left on the boys head.</p>

<p>i believe we were later told it was about the cold war or something but being a fucking 9 year old i didn&#39;t get it.</p>

<p>i did however understand the oppression displayed in this film on a level that made me feel really uneasy.</p>

<p>help me find it please? was this some weird brainwashing? was anyone else shown this as a kid?</p>

<p>thanks for reading.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p><a href="/u/ravageritual">/u/ravageritual</a> had a similar <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2r0f29/i_too_was_shown_an_odd_disturbing_video_as_a/">experience</a></p>

<p>EDIT 2:</p>

<p>thank you all for reading, commenting and sharing your similar stories. if you experienced something similar i don&#39;t mind if you post it here at all. seems quite a few people experienced something similar in their childhood. </p>

<p>someone else asked about the movie i saw <a href="http://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/13134/old-soviet-bloc-film-involving-shoe-print-in-the-back-of-the-head">here</a> but no answers yet. thank you <a href="/u/twsmith">/u/twsmith</a> i have no idea how you found this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember in elementary school several very strange situations pressed on the class and observed by teachers ect... the one that jumps to my mind was a video my class was shown like in 4th grade or about there about a red balloon and a blue balloon there was no dialog but the balloons got into a series of situations designed to illicit emotional empathy for them. I remember having very strong emotional attachment to the red balloon and a protective feeling over the blue one lol. over the years I have asked people about the short film. my btothers have all seen it and all my friends that grew up aroind here friends from out of state dont seem to know what im talking about....this would have been back in the early 80&#39;s hope this helps.</p>
