    <div class="md"><p>Newsflash. Bush has been out of office for 6 years. More like Obama, because Bush was hated by the people. Obama is adored and cab do nothing wrong..like Hitler.

You obviously don&#39;t know that Stanley Dunham (Obama&#39;s maternal grandfather) was related to George H.W. Bush, and Stanley worked under Bush in the CIA. You&#39;re also apparently oblivious to the fact that Prescott Bush (George H.W. Bush&#39;s father) funded the Nazi party.

<p>Because he&#39;s merely a finger puppet.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I never mentioned his name because he&#39;s a new pawn in an old game, and he is quite irrelevant in the grand scheme. Obama is just a current face for the ignorant to focus on while the marionettes pull the strings. I never said that &quot;Obama was put in place by Bush,&quot; however I do not doubt that, nor would I be surprised to find it out. Who do you think helped Obama cover his tracks? (George H.W. Bush) What other political ties did he have aside from the Bush family? (None)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why the love of Obama if he&#39;s a Bush plant? </p>

<p>Heh, so because I &quot;never mention his name&quot; I have &quot;love&quot; for the parasite? That&#39;s quite a nonsensical assumption. Since you mentioned it, I have 0 love or respect for any and ALL politicians. Now, do not make anymore assumptions about me.</p>

Secondly, the moron I was speaking to made a comment about someone that I wasn&#39;t even talking about. Stupid people should be treated like their stupid. You speak as if your opinion of me is even remotely significant. Morality is individually subjective, and therefore irrelevant to this conversation. Your comment exemplifies the fact that the ignorance of Americans is based on their irrelevant perception of the messenger.

<p>&quot;Countries bombed: Obama 7, Bush 4.&quot;</p>

<p>But (needless to say?) that says nothing of how many people were actually murdered.</p>

<p>Frankly, I sincerely doubt Obama has even come close to the numbers that Bush Sr. racked up during the Gurl War.</p>

<p>Which isn&#39;t to even speak of Shock &amp; Awe™ (effective genocide committed by Bush Jr).  OK. I said it.  Bush Jr.&#39;s administration.</p>

<p>I agree in concept.  Every administration is just the runner in a longer relay race.  But for each Administration, the buck stops at the top.  Anyway, we were talking about Bush Sr.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s out of context, secret organizations infiltrate other organizations all the time. What you are saying doesn&#39;t make sense without proof. </p>

<p>By actions alone, no Obama is not the same administration, could he like some of the ideas of other mad men? Yea, it&#39;s possible it makes sense great minds think alike. </p>

<p>I also noticed that somebody obviously doesn&#39;t like him as the assassination attempts on his life are numerous compared to other presidents, not only this but the media directly projects these incidents on a massive scale. Almost like they want people to replicate the idea. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you this, people don&#39;t try left and right to hurt someone who doesn&#39;t have a bit of truth and righteousness to them. You can judge him all you want, but the truth is this world is fucked and it&#39;s clear that him and other people don&#39;t get along well it&#39;s no secret we don&#39;t have to lie. </p>

<p>He&#39;s a real person, a robin hood of the modern day, don&#39;t let these funded conspiracy nuts fool you. Obama is the anarchist just like Jesus the person who thought outside the box and definitely will try to bring truth to the world but that can only be done if we help him. </p>

<p>If you can follow centuries of lies and deceit, what does it hurt to follow one man for a few years and see what he has to offer? In this current state we are fucked, in other state we could be fucked but I&#39;m willing to take that chance. </p>

<p>But I digress, most people will only follow the devil they know than the devil they don&#39;t.</p>

<p>I want to explain myself, It&#39;s not that I am some crazy dude who just got on conspiracy theories, on the contrary, I am from Detroit a high school drop out. I wanted to be a rapper, I worked hard and got a lot of people in my &quot;hood&quot; who liked my music. One day me and my friend were walking it had to be late night somewhere on 7 mile and we came across this CD called &quot;It&#39;s a damn shame&quot;. It was confusing and we thought it was some kind of hood porno and when we put it in our brains were broken by the deceit of the world. </p>

<p>In fact all aspirations of becoming a rapper slowly faded over time. I didn&#39;t want to be involved in a big lie. I began looking for other means of knowledge I knew this wasn&#39;t even the surface of things and that more information could be gained, incomes YouTube. A plethora of information thrown at me from all sources and minds, at first I was like wow this is crazy, it can be real but as time went on I began thinking different, my mind began to slowly decipher different opinions and undress them with quite a eye on what was propaganda and what was not. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a fan of them all, from David Icke to Alex Jones, that was years ago haha, I&#39;ve since started to gain a knowledge of who these people actually work for and what they stand for and what they will do to protect their investors. It&#39;s all bullshit honestly, bunch of fear mongering and nonsense, in fact the amount of conspiracy videos on youtube almost tripled by the time Obama took office. Isn&#39;t that funny? When a black man is in office conspiracy videos are thrown up in every conceivable way to make them look as if they started it all. They&#39;ve went as far to paint this man as the DEVIL himself in a discovery channel special. Comon.</p>

<p>Just for the record, there is no &quot;Bush Jr.&quot; There is George Herbert Walker Bush a.k.a. &quot;Poppy,&quot; and George Walker Bush a.k.a. &quot;W.&quot; This is a common misconception that is actually quite important to the Bush/Scherff lineage.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s proof that Clinton was briefed about BinLaden hijacking planes almost 3 years before it happened, which of course George W. would have known about it since Herbert Walker was Clinton&#39;s adviser on military action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize that George H.W. Bush started a war in Iraq in 1990, his son then oversaw 9-11 to ensure a new war would be started with Iraq, and started another war with Afghanistan. That makes 3 for those who are mathematically challenged. How many has Obama started? Oh yeah that&#39;s right, ZEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOO. You probably also forgot about &quot;The Patriot Act&quot; which was the Genesis of the NDAA. Oh, and George Walker Bush upheld Clinton&#39;s &quot;gun ban&quot; that Obama let expire.</p>

<p>Apparently, I&#39;m the only one on this thread with a vote, and sources to substantiate my claim. I don&#39;t think that anyone else deserves to be named until the claims are backed up with evidence. I&#39;ve provided several examples, while everyone else just blurts a name out. The drones aren&#39;t in Afghanistan. They&#39;re right here!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where did Prescott Bush get his money to fund the Nazis? Paul Warburg who was also instrumental in the creation of the Federal Reserve, and appointed as the representative of the Rothschild family in the U.S. &quot;At the time of his death he was chairman of the Manhattan Company and a director of the Bank of Manhattan Trust Company, Farmers Loan and Trust Company of New York, First National Bank of Boston, Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, Union Pacific Railroad, Los Angeles &amp; Salt Lake Railroad, Western Union Telegraph Company, American I.G. Chemical Company, Agfa Ansco Corporation, and Warburg &amp; Company of Amsterdam. His son James Warburg  was a financial adviser to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the first years of his presidency.&quot; I highly recommend that you to conduct some extensive research on this subject before you form an ignorant opinion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>American banks and corporations did work with the Hitler regime, usually a continuation of previous financial arrangements going back decades, but this was not part of any grand conspiracy to bring Hitler to power. The claim that the Bush family was integral to the rise of Hitler is another myth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So? Does that negate the fact that the father of 2 (or 3 after JEB takes the seat next year) U.S. presidents funded the Nazis with money from a Jewish family? Furthermore, did I say that Prescott was the only person who funded the NDSAP?</p>

<p>No, it contextualizes it, i.e. it&#39;s nothing to get excited about.</p>
