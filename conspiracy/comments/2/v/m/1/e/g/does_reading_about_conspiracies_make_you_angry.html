<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Nope. Two wrongs don&#39;t make a right, and me vandalizing someone&#39;s white picket isn&#39;t fixing any problems. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Nope. I will turn the other cheek, as that method seems to have withstood 2 millinia of persecution. =)</p>

<p>Coming on Reddit, and telling ppl thier not doing enough when a) you have no idea what projects ppl are working on. What if some of these ppl have channels that promote and enlighten? Sure there are one or two. And how about the person that actually serves thier community, not trod through the day for a civil wage and sweet pension. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is the best way to resist the enemy is to make the world a better place, not burn the damn thing down to the ground. The foundation is fine, we just need to do a lil work on the condition, simple as that. And everyday, I would bet upvotes to downvotes, a vast amount of the nearly quater million ppl that subscribe to this sub do just that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tearing down fences was to suggest removing things such as borders or that wall Israel has, and the like. When it comes to revolution, you might need to return violence with violence in order to preserve yourself. While I do think it is essential to make the world a better place by peaceful means, there are those who will use violence to oppose progress, and they are currently quite powerful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Violence only breeds the beast that currently is our problem. if humanity can&#39;t learn to treat eachother in a non-violent and respectful mannor, society will always be in a cycle of rise and decay. The only way to promote and preserve rise is through peace and understanding, and going sword to sword with these ppl won&#39;t teach them anything, and it could cost you your life. that&#39;s a win for them, because you&#39;re not enlightening anyone as a corpse, certainly not one that if is ever heard about will be depicted as a loon. I read another post you put, you worry about that shit. That right there is why you are not qualitied to ask this question. you are not willing to die for a cause, you ask someone else to be your martyr, it&#39;s all down below, well, maybe above by the time some of you are reading this, but at the time of posting anyways, so since you are not willing to give anything, not your life, freedom, but only malice resistance, i&#39;d say tptb already have you beat. you sound like despite all your rage you&#39;re still just a rat in a cage.</p>

We tear it all down, this convo never takes place, cause no more internet, everything broken into tribes again, and ofcourse, they&#39;ll congell and make nations and so forth, it just is hitting reset.

    <div class="md"><p>No borders</p>

<p>That&#39;s gonna be tough. People like their property lines (in the US)</p>

<p>No Armies</p>

<p>That&#39;s gonna be tough. There&#39;s <strong>a lot of people</strong> in the military or employed by the military. Shit - if you subscribe to the military-industrial-complex theory of them running the show lately - this is impossible. We spend half of our federal budget annually on this industry.</p>

<p>No Rulers/Kings/etc</p>

<p>This will be tough too - but I enjoy the idea of taking the executive down a few pegs</p>

<p>No Organized Religions</p>

<p>This will be extremely tough. The catholic church and Islam (if ever united to any degree) pose as awesome institutions that have been running groups of people for thousands of years. That&#39;s a tough nut to crack.</p>

<p>Limited Local Governments</p>

<p>This is where you start. When&#39;s your next town council meeting? How is your local government set up? Do you even know who your selectman/alderman/etc is? Guess what you&#39;re looking up tomorrow?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are my thoughts on those topics...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>No Borders -- I believe there should be borders. But only to retain legislation, not People.</p></li>
<li><p>No Armies -- I believe in the Militia, the Peoples right to defend themselves. The more organized, the better. But these militias should not enforce local laws, and should not be paid positions. It would behoove the citizenry to have all abled bodies train in the use of firearms, urban warfare, squad tactics, as well as hand to hand combat, to suit their environment the most efficiently for the best defense. Im not fond of sending armies into international territories, and to this extent, i can agree with you.</p></li>
<li><p>No Rulers/Kings -- If by this you mean no monarchy, then i agree. I would like to see representatives of each state, altogether, take up the position of &quot;president&quot;. With appropriate term limits, rotations, and abolishing career politicians, this could be very beneficial to a free society.</p></li>
<li><p>No Organized Religions -- I believe in seperstion of Church and State. If christians want to gather, let them. If jews wish to gather, let them. Muslims? Let them. Let the People organize however they want. But eith true seperation of church and state, their religiousness should not affect legislation (and vice versa) and, thus, shouldnt pose an issue. On hot-topic debates such as abortion, the local governments would decide the legality. If one doesnt like the ruling in their local area, they are frer to move to another locale that better suits their beliefs, opinions, wants, and needs.</p></li>
<li><p>Limited Local Governments -- Im not sure where, exactly you are going with this one. I believe that the local governments should be the strongest and most authoritstive part of the entire government. It is closest to the people, and thusly cloesly resembles the People of its jurisdiction, so long as nepotism, term limits, rotations, and career politicians are regulated/controlled/or removed altogether. Any taxes should be minimal, and votes should be had on every project, in regards to infrastructure.</p></li>

<p>Ive recently been reading through the &quot;antifederalist papers&quot;, and they have some great points against the constitution (as it was drafted). </p>

<p>To be honest, i would start all the way back to 1787 and revisit the arguments for and against our constitution. Afterall, some of the arguments against the constitution involved evils (e.g. nepotism, lack of representation of the People, corruption, etc) that have cleary come to fruition in todays world...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, i am a marginal pacifist. I dont believe violence is the best recourse, no matter the situation. Although, i understand sometimes it is the only option. Thus, in the event of violence, it should be decidedly swift and brutal and straight to the point with the least amount of collateral damage possible. And of course, as a last resort. Tearing down fences is only good publicity. Its childsplay. Rioting in the streets puts innocents at risk, and lends credence to the argument for even more &quot;national security&quot; preservation measures.</p>

<p>Sitting at home enrolling oneself into the armchair militia lends credence to the phrase, &quot;idle hands do the work of the devil.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re doing the last option right now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You dont even know. I mean, i get your point with this whole PSA angle you are going for. And for many folks, you would be correct. However, i do know that there are millions of people who know better than to believe all the shit we are fed. I know i am not alone, and that my position is sound. </p>

<p>I will not be the first to fire. I will not be the first to draw blood. I would not even admit that i would seek violence, even for a good cause. </p>

<p>But i sure as hell would defend my family, friends, and neighbors, as well as my countrymen. </p>

<p>And i dont need a keyboard to do that. </p>

<p>Now, i know your post wasnt directed right towards <strong>me</strong>. And i would say that i agree with the generalized sentiment (minus the inferential call-to-arms) of your post. So, i feel compelled to share one of my favorite quotes with you:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“If you love wealth more than liberty, <em>the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom</em>, depart from us in peace. We ask not your counsel nor your arms. Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you. May your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen.”</p>

<p>– Samuel Adams</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I placed emphasis on the relevant part. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And for that honesty I will give you an upvote. How can you channel that anger into something positive and nonviolent that transforms the world for the better? Do you have any hobbies or interests? Sadly a lot of young people spend hours a day here in this sub reading about corruption and negativity, play violent video games and watch violence on television too. How could you not be anxious and angry if the majority of your day was consumed by such things. Try to find a way to balance the information here and the violence you might be exposing yourself to. Do something that makes you feel good. And if you can share that skill with others thats a great accomplishment for anyone. Once you find something like that, you may be able to channel all that energy in a better more productive way that serves people around you that need you skill. Rather than feel like you&#39;re in the middle of a hurricane and helpless in your anger. IMO violence is never the answer or a solution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d rather work than fight tbh, at least with work you&#39;re getting something done, fighting just decreases productivity. I&#39;m not &#39;angry&#39; just annoyed. When I&#39;m not on reddit I&#39;m either meditating, raiding hardcore on WOW, exercising, working at Arby&#39;s, smoking weed, or dancing in my room by myself to some hip jams. I have a pretty well balanced lifestyle and with any balanced lifestyle, there&#39;s gotta be some anger, which I usually just let out by doing punches with a 20 lb dumbbell in my hand or making a post here. In no way do I let my anger control me, but I can use anger to work for me in times that I need it to.</p>
