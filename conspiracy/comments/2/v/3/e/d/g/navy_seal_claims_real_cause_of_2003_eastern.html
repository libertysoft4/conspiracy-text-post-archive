<p>Nothing like this shows up on other sources. Its either grid problems or aliens. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.chrisheben.com/about.html">This might be Chris</a></p>

<p>The way I see it best chance this guy is pulling a story out of his ass to sound cool on the media, with which he has worked closely for a while. Or it&#39;s some SEAL myth he thinks is true. But I am hoping to crowd source some research on this to find out if the story has plausibility. </p>

<p>Let me know if this sub is not well suited to that, thank you for your interest otherwise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is it that SEAL members are looked upon as honest and righteous? Honestly as a retired Gunny, and this just does not apply to only SEAL, bu through th entire military from enlisted through officers. Not all but there is a percentage that are lying two face sociopaths that would stab their buddy in the back to save their ass. Even though they would look you in the eye and not blink and tell you they would die for you. </p>

<p>I doubt this MFer knows jack shit what was going on and is just spouting off to look like he is important. Just fucking drunk talk that got out of hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tbh i dont even k how that would work. But i do know that an emp causes an intense surge of -e&#39;s in metals, and due to our grid set up this could maybe effect equipment a significant distance from the epicenter. </p>

<p>But this would have to be picked up on, like, a ton of stuff right? Who (non-gov) would notice an emp?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can shield circuits from power surges using chokes and baluns, I would venture to guess that most if not all military aircraft have emp shielding. The a-bombs didn&#39;t drop the enola gay, and it was within distance to suffer catastrophic failure from the emp generated. I shield my circuits from stepper motor emp interference, I know it&#39;s small scale, but shielding is possible, the story on the other hand seems implausible at best</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I digress, the gamma rays emitted by the blast are absorbed by anything conductive and cause a surge of electrons that travels through the conductor. For instance, a power line that has 600 volts traveling through it, is hit with gamma radiation, the radiation causes more electron excitement which increases the electromotive force (amperage). What you are referring to is a HEMP where the nuke is used as an EMP device and is more effective at a higher altitude. </p>
