    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>what are your limits</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are none. They are all true. </p>

<p>World leaders are reptilian shape shifters from outer space drinking the blood of the newborn in occult rituals, the moon is their space station and Niburu its mother ship. They breed humans like humans breed cattle and feed on them by sucking their brain energy out of them with mobile phones and TV sets, boosting the yield by feeding them GMOs and poisoned water and injecting funny stuff into their veins. They collect all the gold and extract the monatomic elements to become immortal and keep their star gates going, but fear not, an intergalactic alliance of Aryan Greys will come to the rescue from within the hollow earth and bring us an everlasting utopia if we meditate real hard and remember to energize the atmosphere with that pyramid I have in my online shop for only U$ 350.-!</p>

<p>There are no limits. They all are true. </p>

<p>Except, of course, for the Twin Towers, they really came down minutes after planes hijacked by religious extremists slammed into them because their structure was three times heavier than it could support, as Bazant/Verdure show in &quot;<a href="http://www.civil.northwestern.edu/people/bazant/PDFs/Papers/466.pdf">Metaphysics of Progressive Collapse</a>&quot;, 2007, Equation 6. </p>

<p>And except for the monetary system, of course. Usury, compound interest, inflation and deflation all are the canary birds of a healthy and prosperous economy and demurrage would totally catapult us back into the stone ages. </p>

<p>And except for the medical-pharmaceutical complex, of course, they are only interested in our well-being and inhaling d9-THC will turn you into a lobotomized child-rapist. </p>

<p>And except for the educational system, it&#39;s all about empowering our children, shaping their minds and giving them the best start into a bright future. All that synergetic thinking and wild imagination only leads to nutty people without a job to pay their taxes from. </p>

<p>And except for the industrial-military complex, the best means to secure peace is superior firepower, and how would we fight for peace without handing all that sci-fi weapon tec out to our foes and friends?</p>

<p>And except for the media, nothing is as vital for a healthy democracy than voters who are well-informed about the issues at hand. Consensual decision-making on the basis of weighing all the pros and cons is a long and tiresome process and gets nothing ever done. </p>

<p>And except for zionism. Every little backwards cult should have the right to produce an old scroll to prove they have a divine right to do whatever their high priests say is G-ds command. </p>

<p>These really are too ridiculous to discuss seriously and rationally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I use logic.  If a theory relates to John Lear, Ben Fulford, David Icke, Wilcott, Kerry Cassidy, Dan Burish, Mark Dice, Jordan Maxwell, etc I tend to dismiss them.  Especially John Lear, if he isn&#39;t lying his butt off he has to be insane.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t believe in Reptilians, remote viewing, that particle weapon from space brought down the WTC, that there is a secret space program with a base on Mars and that humans are working with martians, there were 2 underground cities of Illuminati personnel nuked, that the Chinese mafia are fighting the Illuminati, the satanic or Illuminati symbols at the Super Bowl have any effect on anyone, John Titor, crop circles.</p>

<p>I do believe the US government routinely lies to the citizens.  The surveillance stuff, the total erosion of civil liberties, the IRS attacking the Right Wing, and the trillions of dollars that can&#39;t be accounted for by the government scare me.  </p>

<p>I like to read the post here when people debate each other without ending with one calling the other a shill.  Because using the word shill is really lazy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The shale shifting invisible jews one is pretty good.</p>

<p>Reptilians. </p>

<p>The moon landing.</p>

<p>Grand highly and tightly orchestrated conspiracies are also hard to swallow. I don&#39;t believe there is a worldwide conspiracy of almost any type. At least not as tightly controlled as many here would believe.  The NWO agenda is likely a more loose conglomeration of leaders and those in power with somewhat aligned goals.  911 I think may have been a few smaller conspiracies, not one grand one (one Intel agency involved in the ignoring or even helping hijackers, and a separate one involving the pre-wiring of hi rise buildings with failsafe methods of demolition as a necessary evil in case of catastrophic damage.</p>

<p>If there is a powerful antagonist to a proposed conspiracy that acts incongruous with the conspiracy it is likely false (russia agreeing the moon landing was real.)</p>

<p>Many conspiracies are no more than conspiracies of greed, or simply a natural result of the legal and economic framework we have allowed to be constructed without questioning it&#39;s effects. Such as medical research and funding and the numerous issues around establishing safety or efficacy of medications.  I don&#39;t think it is a plot to chemically lobotomized or reduce the population. It is just human greed lumped atop human stupidity that let such an incestuous system to become the status quo.</p>

<p>yes, i have also been told this, but it is just a clever deception. </p>

<p>you are told you are smart, so naturally you want to believe it, even if its not true. </p>

<p>you are given good grades, to reinforce the idea that you are smart, but in fact grades are just a measure of your brainwashing. </p>

<p><em>what year did Christopher Columbus cross the Atlantic Ocean?</em> </p>

<p>who cares? </p>

<p><em>What is the definition of usury?</em></p>

<p>like Albert Einstein once said, if he needed to know some bit of trivial data, he knew how to look it up.</p>

<p>you are fed a steady diet of &quot;education&quot;, information, and &quot;news&quot; that is actually just disinformation and propaganda, then when you fully swallow the &quot;news&quot; and disinformation then they reward you by telling you that you are &quot;well informed&quot;</p>

<p>did you know that the Green Party Candidate Jill Stein was arrested outside the &quot;presidential debate&quot; that she was excluded from? oh, you didn&#39;t? and here you assumed you were well informed?</p>

<p>now, because you feel so smart and well-informed, you naturally think everyone else is an idiot, crazy, and/or ill-informed. </p>

<p>its hard to fathom the size and scale of the deception, but this poster might help visualize</p>

<p>no, we are born as sheep. you, me, all of us. livestock to owned and lead around by judas goats. </p>

<p>The CDC whistleblower himself (Dr. William Thompson) said this in response to anti-vaxxers trying to turn him into a poster child:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.morganverkamp.com/august-27-2014-press-release-statement-of-william-w-thompson-ph-d-regarding-the-2004-article-examining-the-possibility-of-a-relationship-between-mmr-vaccine-and-autism/">http://www.morganverkamp.com/august-27-2014-press-release-statement-of-william-w-thompson-ph-d-regarding-the-2004-article-examining-the-possibility-of-a-relationship-between-mmr-vaccine-and-autism/</a></p>

<p>If you actually read his own words, he said he had an issue with a small finding in the study being excluded, not exactly the bombshell everyone made it out to be.</p>

<p>I guess it speaks to the desperation of anti-science folks when instead of producing studies they record a man without his knowing and twist his words to fit their agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s bs. You can even look up the cameras that were there. There were at least 20 they should&#39;ve been caught on, possibly more. Do you think we were all two years old back then?</p>
