        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I really believe that those who participate regularly here in this thread should have a greater say in the mods here in this sub.</p>

<p>Just as this sub is very dynamic, and the popularity of subjects changes frequently,  mods here should also be dynamic,  and reflect the current state of the sub. I&#39;ve seen a few mods here get voted in as a mod,  then completely stop posting content or comments to the channel their supposed to be modding.</p>

<p>For instance, I&#39;ve gone through the comment and link history for the following mods here:</p>

<p><a href="/u/illuminatedwax">/u/illuminatedwax</a></p>

<p><a href="/u/Sarah_Connor">/u/Sarah_Connor</a></p>

<p><a href="/u/9000Sins">/u/9000Sins</a> (who literally hasn&#39;t posted here in a month,  despite being active across many other subs)</p>

<p>They all are either not very active on Reddit at all,  or their acetone in other subs much more then <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.   If thru are going to be watching over this sub and the posts that are made here,  I want them to eat, drink,  and dream <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

<p>It is very clear that some of the mods here are no longer active in this sub, and could be replaced by others who ate much more active and familiar with the current dynamics here,  leading to a much better experience for ghost who really contribute and view this sub as their number 1 destination for information like I do. </p>

<p>How can we update mods here to ensure that they are current, and contribute to this sub more so then any other sub?  It doesn&#39;t really make sense for any mod here to post to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, or <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> 3 times more then they comment or post to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></p>

<p>It shouldn&#39;t be like the Supreme Court,  where you are a mod for life,  leaving almost no accountability to these mods after they&#39;ve been elected,  it should be more democratic in narrow nature, where those who are participating here should be able to regularly choose the mods here. </p>

<p>What do you guys think? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are both here to control the thought process of this sub. Whether they realize it or not. They are both heavy handed with the censorship. They feel like it is their duty to decide what can be posted and what cannot based on &quot;what the sub would be interested in&quot;. Meaning they get to decide what we are interested in. Their worldbview (both of them) is very limited. That is why they are allowed and encouraged to moderate here. That is why Flytape can get reinstated after a shadowban. Who ever gets unshadowbanned? I&#39;ll tell you who. Plants. </p>

<p>I am not suggesting either is being paid. As I said, I am sure they are not even aware of their actions. That is how these things work. They are chosen, and allowed to stay, because whatever it is that drives them, is well aligned with the agenda of TPTB.</p>

<p>Just look at SM&#39;s comment history. &quot;Rule 10. Removed&quot;, &quot;Rule 6. Removed&quot; etc etc etc. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s something they don&#39;t personally care for, it&#39;s removed. If you argue, you are banned. </p>

<p>That way, this sub becomes a system of control. We are allowed to circlejerk about certain topics, but our boundaries are well defined.</p>

<p>Just last week, SM was removing all the Anti-Vax posts. Him and Flytape were both big vax supporters. Now that enough people have screamed about it, the other mods have taken a stronger Anti-Vax stand. Which now limits FT&#39;s and SM&#39;s ability to censor it. </p>

<p>Big time lurker here of 2 years. Do you know something that I dont? </p>

<p>In the 12 months that u/9000sins has been mod, u/axolotl_peyoti and u/assuredlyathrowaway have been highly visible moderators. During the same 12 months, some users who would go on to become mods, were participating more than 9000sins. </p>

<p>The only activity I have noticed from 9000sins is the username moving as i scroll down the page. I could be wrong since I am not here 24/7 but I am here enough to call out bullshit when I see it. I could provide links but I&#39;m a too lazy a fuck to find them. </p>

<p>Flytape evaded a ban in SRD with an alt and was mass reported until the admins shadowbanned his main account (which is interesting, because when I have reported ban evaders from this sub in the past (ky1e as an example) only their alt account was shadowbanned.</p>

<p>That said, while flytape was shadowbanned we removed him from the modlist, and when the admins lifted the ban (with a mandate that he no longer partcipate in srd) we readded him to the mod list.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We did indeed have a round of mod nominations, and the canidates were announced <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2ns0w9/new_moderators_and_an_announcement_regarding_a/">here</a> after the voting concluded. </p>

<p>SovereignMan did indeed decline his nomination during the last addition of mods, but he was kind enough to take up a mod spot after taking some time to consider the matter. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>We recently did remove one inactive mod (<a href="/u/three_letter_agency">/u/three_letter_agency</a>, who is busy writing a book); but we are actually doing quite well in terms of mod activity at the moment. As I mentioned in another comment, the modqueue is always at zero, the spam filter is constantly cleared out, and we are able to reply to modmail messages with 5-10 minutes for the most part.</p>

<p>If we do another round of mod nominations it will likely be with the same qualifications as last time; one mod vouch required for a nomination to be considered and the thread will be put in contest mode to prevent certain meta subs from manipulating the voting.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quantumcipher was also removed due to illness. (S)he had my nomination in that mod vote. I made a post here about 2 months ago questioning the inactivity of both TLA and Quantum. My post was downvoted.  Both accounts went without reddit activity for more than a month after daily use.  I also messaged mods and got responses. I think we should consider 900 sins and what exactly that mod does or doesn&#39;t do here. The last thing I recall was 900 sins posting an old supposed &quot;illuminati&quot; video where a scantily clad woman was dancing provocatively on a stage in front of men in suits and 900 sins was asking folks to ID the men.  That stood out to me as quite odd for an inactive mod. </p>

If you&#39;re a regular here, as most mods are, then this is something you should be capable of overlooking. Sometimes, those submissions you are talking about, are a quality read. Vote.Comment. Reply. </p>

<p>There are several problems with your reply to OP.</p>

<ol>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont like the notion of replacing. That infers that the number of mods would remain the same. I believe that there should be a greater number of mods, to increase the ration if representatives vs the represented. </p>

<p>With that said, i do like the idea of a rotationary seating. Maybe even callbit term limits. But, the mods here have the most experience, and this shouldnt be abandoned. Some even maintain the bots, as well, which is helpful. Also helpful is their technical skills as far as site design and the computet lsnguage of reddit. This cannot be abandoned by average &quot;citizens&quot; of this sub. </p>

<p>Also, i like the rules, here. I also like how they are enforced, although it does have a negative side of things that allow some users to abuse this. </p>

<p>I am a firm bekiever in moderator transparency, making each ban public with an explanation a priority. How do we insure this will happen eith fresh personslities coming in all the time?</p>

<p>These are serious questions, and there are more, thst we as a community need to address and consider. Knee jerk decisions are to be avoided, and with over a quarter million subscribers, it is importsnt that we keep to our ways in regards to the rules and the enforcement thereof.</p>

<p>These are just things to think about, imo...</p>

<p>what exactly do mods do</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the most part we enforce the sidebar rules.</p>

<p>We also monitor comment sections for admin shadowbanned users (who&#39;se comments are sent directly into the site wide spam filter) in order to approve those comments and alert the user to their shadowbanned status. </p>

<p>It is also the case that we monitor the spam filter of the subreddit to approve submissions/comments which contain <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/28d487/meta_the_reddit_admins_employees_automatically/">certain domains that the admins have banned site wide</a>. Infowars, for example, is on the list; which means that we have to manually approve every comment which links to that domain.</p>

<p>We also strive to protect the free flow of information on the sub by keeping an eye on various &quot;meta subreddits&quot; which continually invade and attack this sub. To that end, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/SbqM5ff.png">we keep out nefarious manipulators who attempt to get on the mod list</a>, report and ban people like bipolarbear who spam the sub with racist trash, and make sure admins are notified when other subs/snoonet channels engage in &quot;raids&quot; on the userbase of this sub.</p>

<p>The ethos of organically curated content/free speech on this subreddit is a thorn in the side to certain groups on this site who would prefer a moratorium on discussions of certain topics. For example, at one point in this sub&#39;s history there was a user who infiltrated the modteam and attempted to ban all discussion of reddit censorship. </p>

<p>We are, in essence, one of the last large subreddits which truly upholds the principle of free flowing information that this site&#39;s true founder (Aaron Swartz) worked tirelessly to inculcate.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the direction reddit has taken, as a result of <a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/?q=antique+jetpack&amp;amp;mfrom=&amp;amp;mto=&amp;amp;title=&amp;amp;notitle=&amp;amp;date=&amp;amp;nofrom=&amp;amp;noto=&amp;amp;count=50&amp;amp;sort=0&amp;amp;file=&amp;amp;docid=&amp;amp;relid=0#searchresult">people like Alexis Ohanian and Erik Martin</a>, is diametrically opposed to the organic curation of content. That means this mod team is up against not only certain groups within the &quot;reddit meta&quot;, but the admin team as well.</p>

<p>To that end, we are quite careful with who we add to the mod team (for our most recent round of mod nominations we required that a mod already on the team vouch for any potential nominations); and it is precisely because we are one of the the only 250,000+ subs that actually holds mod elections via a user voting process that we have to take certain precautions to prevent someone like EMR1028 or bipolarbear from getting an alt account on the mod list. </p>

<p>The top mod here, illuminatedwax, is not active; but he serves an important role in as much as if any mod were to &quot;go rogue&quot; (which did happen at one point in the subs history) he would be able to step in and revert any malicious changes. </p>

<p>That said, we have a very active mod team at the moment; I believe our response time to modmail inquiries is usually no longer than 5-10 minutes and we always keep the spam filter and modqueue entirely cleared out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you just hoping to be a head mod or something? I don&#39;t see why being utterly consumed with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a prerequisite to being a mod. I would find it rather suspicious if someone didn&#39;t appear to sleep or go to work. Seriously, what would you think if you realized their entire life was just this sub. Surely they have bills to pay, friends to hang out; a life to live outside of this forum. So, if they did this like it was their job, I would wonder. I prefer a more Laissez-Faire approach to the handling of this sub, anyways. I know I&#39;m not really a poster or much of a commenter, but I see no reason to disband the already existing mods other than your feeling that they aren&#39;t about this life enough. </p>
