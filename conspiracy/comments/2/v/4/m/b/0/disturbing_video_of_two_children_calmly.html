    <div class="md"><p>Most Jewish people today are medern/moderat/secular Jews (they take the good and leave the bad).</p>

<p>However, most of the &quot;Jews&quot; in power are (political/Rothschild) Zionists pretending to be Jewish.</p>

<p>Jewish people and evil (political/Rothschild) Zionists are not the same thing! This above mentioned form of Zionism is a very racist, genocidal, greedy, self-serving, unsympathetic, sociopathic, psychopathic, and fundamental ideology. There are Zionists that are not claiming to be &quot;Jewish&quot;, but &quot;Christian&quot; (faux Christian), such as the Bush Family and Biden. Many of the Zionists claim to be &quot;Jewish&quot;, in part, to discredit any and all critics with a dismissive conversation ender by calling them &quot;anti-Semites&quot;. Zionists that claim to be Jewish are about as Jewish as terrorists claiming to be Muslim (as in, not at all true to the (modern/secular/moderat) religions).</p>

<p>Part of the plan by these (political/Rothschild) Zionists that claim to be Jewish is to have the masses hate actual Jewish people and Israel for their atrocities; The average uninformed/missinformed person may mistake these Zionists as true Jewish people, and falsely blame humanist Jewish people for all of the atrocities of the Zionists (War, Coup de tats, Usery, human rights/constitutional defying laws/policies/actions, etc.).</p>

<p>The three big (political/Rothschild) Zionist Occupied Governments (ZOGs) are the USA, the UK, and Israel. Many other countries are also controlled, owned, and operated by the Zionists (through Central banking, mega corporations that politically lobby federal politicians, mainstream media, etc.). Many USFG politicians have Israel-USA dual citizenships.</p>

<p>The Zionist grid of power in a nutshell: The USA is Israels bitch, the USA, Israel, UK (and others) are the bitches of the (political/Rothschild) Zionists, and the Zionists are the bitches of the top-of-the-top of the Global Elites/Powers That Be (PTB)/Illuminati.</p>

<p>Protip: When trying to denounce (political/Rothschild) Zionism and its ilk, for the love of God, do not use David Duke as a source! Duke may be right about the power of Zionism to an extent, but using Duke as a source probably discredits the Conspiracy/Truth/Dissent movement since Duke used to be a KKK Grand Wizard, is a white-supremacist, and is also not fond of Jewish people (even if they are humanist and not Zionists).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know Janet Reno was involved in that cover-up. This is in fact genuine. The eyewitnesses who described the horrors of the &quot;Satanic panic&quot; were telling the truth, but they were quickly suppressed by an army of lawyers and psychologists who invented &quot;false memory syndrome&quot; to explain it away. </p>

<p>Elite circles do engage in human sacrifice and ritual abuse. Some of us are privy to this fact and know it quite well. You may not believe in occult power, or magic, or the devil/evil force, or spirits, or anything of that form; but it is real and it is powerful. You will not be able to understand what is going on unless you consider this dimension. It also helps to have a good understanding of MK ULTRA (and related programs) and how trauma-based mind control works. </p>

<p>Anyway I am glad this is getting attention! I posted the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2v15of/fear_is_the_mindkiller_very_strange_video_of_two/">original thread.</a> <a href="/u/delelles">/u/delelles</a> made a <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2v2l6o/children_describe_taking_part_in_rituals_where/">follow-up thread</a> which contains all of the most recent information. </p>

<p>This is pretty serious and your flippant comments make a mockery of it, are you stating this is an &quot;acting&quot; piece by this family?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well us there no investigation in to these allegations? These kids name names and crimes. Horrible crimes. Rape, murder cannibalism. Like a fucking trifecta of heinous crimes. If they are unfounded the kids and parents could be held libel for slander.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know Janet Reno was involved in that cover-up. This is in fact genuine. The eyewitnesses who described the horrors of the &quot;Satanic panic&quot; were telling the truth, but they were quickly suppressed by an army of lawyers and psychologists who invented &quot;false memory syndrome&quot; to explain it away. </p>

<p>Elite circles do engage in human sacrifice and ritual abuse. Some of us are privy to this fact and know it quite well. You may not believe in occult power, or magic, or the devil/evil force, or spirits, or anything of that form; but it is real and it is powerful. You will not be able to understand what is going on unless you consider this dimension. It also helps to have a good understanding of MK ULTRA (and related programs) and how trauma-based mind control works. </p>

<p>Anyway I am glad this is getting attention! I posted the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2v15of/fear_is_the_mindkiller_very_strange_video_of_two/">original thread.</a> <a href="/u/delelles">/u/delelles</a> made a <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2v2l6o/children_describe_taking_part_in_rituals_where/">follow-up thread</a> which contains all of the most recent information. </p>

<p>Spread this far and wide friends.  </p>
