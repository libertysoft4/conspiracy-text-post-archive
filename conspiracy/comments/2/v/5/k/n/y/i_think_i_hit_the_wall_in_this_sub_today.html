    <div class="md"><p>Most people have no understanding of just how evil and psychopathic people in power are.  They crave control because they relate to the world through power, and they accomplish it in all sorts of control systems because they have no psychological barriers like a conscience to slow them down on their way to the top.  Once there they revel in their psychopathy and engage in all sorts of disgusting debauchery that would horrify the average person.  They begin pushing normal people out of the organization under them and support and advance psychopaths so that they can more easily get away with their decadence.  This continues as long as the institution exists until ALL the leaders are psychopaths and at this point they are practically unstoppable.  They absolutely revel in causing pain and suffering to others and laugh at the naivety of the majority that defer to authority.  They are very good at feigning emotion and bald faced lying to fool people.  They are cocky, arrogant, and they say all the &quot;right&quot; things and make you believe they are kind-hearted souls; not always, but often enough.</p>

<p>These people are born this way and a certain small percentage of the population have this primary psychopathy.  These are more dangerous and incorrigible than people with the other type called secondary psychopathy, which is caused by the dysfunction in the environment.  These make up a larger percentage of the population and the numbers are growing as the society declines.</p>

<p>I strongly suggest that people do their own research and really get a handle on how these people think, how common they are in power structures and how influential they have become,  and the colossal evil they are capable of.  You might start with this <a href="http://winterpatriot.com/node/894">article</a> and this <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/victorlipman/2013/04/25/the-disturbing-link-between-psychopathy-and-leadership/">article</a>.</p>

<p>I also suggest the more open minded to research the illegitimacy of authority and the concepts of anarchism, if you can get passed your instilled aversion to the word &quot;anarchy&quot;.  You might start <a href="http://www.anarchism.net/essays.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>The world is very, <em>very</em> fucked up.  Look into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggxiBWv4xYE">Conspiracy Of Silence</a> if you have never heard of the reality of what these powers are capable of.  You&#39;ll be doing a LOT of praying and going to bed after <em>that</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>when i was a child, i loved reading stories of good vs bad, light vs darkness, but i was aware that the &#39;adult world&#39; regarded these dichotomies as childish, naive, fairy tales.</p>

<p>the funny thing is, the more i grow up and explore the rabbit hole, the more i begin to feel that there really is a very real good vs bad, dark vs light battle going on. it is a spiritual battle within each and everyone of us that extends to our collective physical realities.</p>

<p>and if you can find some quiet space in nature and stop your attention/consciousness from being focused on these dark things, you might get a sense of the &#39;peace that passeth all understanding&#39;. </p>

<p>(i believe) there are dark forces running this world, but as with any good fairytale, there are also the forces of the light. people who speak for truth, goodness and love. this sub is one example, edward snowden is one example. the important thing is not to &#39;find out&#39; who the good guys are (although i believe there are powerful, secret organisations dedicated to the GOOD fight working behind the scenes), but to find the inner peace within yourself, and from that state of peace, fight the battle in your own corner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that they have to hide shows how weak they really are, it&#39;s taken them hundreds... maybe thousands of years to get to where they are now.</p>

<p>Then the internet happened and it threatens to wake everyone up from this nightmare. Of course they had their part to play in the creation of the internet, but I think they quickly lost control of it. 9/11 seems like such a desperate act to maintain power over us, it was such a risky play. I don&#39;t believe they are in as strong of a position as people like to believe. The system only works as long as people believe in this system, and there is one independent economist I know who is predicting a &quot;global collapse in public trust of the government&quot;. The universe wants humanity to evolve and spread across the galaxy, it&#39;s the ultimate destiny of intelligent life.</p>

<p>Those who seek power do so because they are arrogant enough to believe they can control the world. They want to control the world because they are afraid, and they let their fear control them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” - Frank Herbert, <em>Dune</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These sick fucks are delusional and very afraid of us, and it&#39;s quite laughable from my perspective. This doesn&#39;t mean we aren&#39;t in for some rough times. We still have to be very cautious, but I believe we will come out on top of it.</p>

<p>The whole fear thing is one reason I don&#39;t believe David Icke is a shill, because he doesn&#39;t use fear like Alex Jones and the others. I don&#39;t believe these people know how to manipulate us with anything besides fear.</p>

<p>I know for a fact there will be some dramatic events this year. I believe Fukishima is much much worse than what we&#39;re being told, and is actually a huge cover up that can&#39;t be denied much longer. This whole Ukraine deal and anti-Russian propaganda seems like another huge act of desperation to me.</p>

<p>I&#39;m an optimist, but that doesn&#39;t mean I still don&#39;t have a plan B.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>No.  I haven&#39;t gotten a sense of hopelessness because I understand that our being and our identity is tied to a lot more than anything that goes on in this planet alone.  Do I think what happens here sucks?  Oh yeah.  Definitely.  Do I think it&#39;s horrible?  Absolutely.</p>

<p>This is a planet of deep sorrow, however, and since I&#39;m pretty well aware of that - and have been for a long, long time - the understanding that there aren&#39;t too many areas of hope here doesn&#39;t overwhelm me too much.  I understand that there <em>are</em> certain areas still that one can focus on that help one still develop and learn and grow - even here in this planet  - and that helps a bit even in the context of all the horrible stuff that happens.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Um...that&#39;s an AWESOME and a wonderful and a GREAT thing actually!  That can&#39;t happen soon enough!  Truth is the only chance a being has at <em>real</em> improvement, and the more truth and reality one uncovers and understands - even if it&#39;s horrible and frightening and painful - the more one will be able to know what needs to be done in order to GET OUT OF IT and work to improve oneself and one&#39;s surroundings and get better and <em>grow</em>.</p>

<p>Again, the more we know, the better it will be <em>regardless</em> of how frightening or how much of an abomination the truth shows itself to be.</p>

Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me. But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.

    <div class="md"><p>Some of us don&#39;t like religion organized or otherwise, yet still believe that we&#39;re all connected and linked. </p>

<p>The word is <em>agnostic</em> and to bible thumpers and atheists we&#39;re an equal opportunity target. </p>

<p>TKOSM might believe in, quote chapter and verse, lean on, by faith, what was taught, ingrained, yet is still making a strident effort to convey Spirituality apart from and outside of Human conditions. TKOSM shouldn&#39;t be marginalized nor battered by use of Bible scripts anymore than one that quotes the Torah, Koran, Talmud, Bhudda or MSM.</p>

<p>Myself, I couldn&#39;t make it through my day to day, not believing that I&#39;m a spiritual being and that my time and place here matters. Was I <em>created</em>? My parents had sex. I&#39;m the result. What I do with my limited time matters most to me.</p>

<p>Am I spiritual? Yes. Do I worship a figure, text or deity? No.</p>

<p>I plod along, make huge mistakes, give it my best and love all the best I know how. My time here is what I know, the stuff on the other side isn&#39;t relevant. I&#39;m here now.</p>

<p>Mind you: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s hardly a definition. I would say we&#39;re all connected because we all came from a single cell. We all come from the same thing. Everything in existence is in this together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never claimed to know where the single cell came from. I just stated that we all came from that cell so we are without a doubt connected. </p>

<p>I also believe this planet has been inhabited for a very long time, cataclysmic events have without a doubt reset human kinds advancements before. As for other species I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t have any proof.</p>

<p>Why do you believe giants and the Star Child have ever existed? What is your proof?</p>

<p>To say without the honeybee we will go extinct is silly. Without the honeybee we wouldn&#39;t be able to maintain such a high population, but we wouldn&#39;t go extinct. Not every source of food is effected by honeybees. It would definite devastate our current world order though.</p>

<p>We get all tangled up when we apply religion, mans moral law to society. </p>

<p>OP began this thread from rage about pederasts and supported the same via his religious beliefs. Yet, if I pointed out that his/her <em>Holy Book</em> or another holy book supports the use of rape and abuse of a child he/she would flip their shit.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen pederasts clobber threads by using religious text that sadly, fully support their positions. </p>

<p>As a spiritual being, I know I&#39;m limited by time, body decay and communication issues. </p>

<p>I have to be okay, right here, right now. Nothing more. I can only imagine what my grandsons lives might be in just a few short years. </p>

<p><strong>AI</strong> might result in a better Honeybee drone that will not be affected by farming chemicals and <strong>AI</strong> might, by then, have sorted out all the genetic <em>goo</em> that allows our species to evolve and tolerate the toxins.</p>

<p>On principle grounds of my own perceived moral stance I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to protect another. I&#39;m spiritual. There&#39;s good and bad. I certainly want the good to prevail.  </p>

<p>You lean towards Eugenics, as does Bill Gates and yet he balks at <strong>AI</strong>. Why would he?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your creation was more spiritual and intentional then the ovulation cycle of your mother and the virility of your father. </p>

<p>I see you used the word worship, almost derogatorily, then talk about walking without direction. If you drop the rebellion against what ever rules or judgemental deity you&#39;ve come to resent, you&#39;d see that parables, church teachings, etc are guidelines for progress and the fulfillment of your soul. Sin doesn&#39;t exist as a leverage system for a vengeful god to play out his punishments, it&#39;s the separation of your actions from the truth of your soul. Sin hurts you or others, so that&#39;s why it&#39;s advised against. </p>

<p>Am I spiritual? Yes. Do I worship a figure, text or deity? No.</p>

<p>I&#39;m spiritual right where I am in the moment. Guess I also worship more than you might know. No building is required. I make mistakes and I make amends. Do I lack direction? No. Often times I&#39;m fully aware that my actions could get me fired but I wing it, go on <em>faith</em> if you will that breaking a rule keeps someone off the streets. My <em>tithe</em> goes directly to shelters and charities that do not have outlandish salaries for buildings, Administrators and Lawyers. </p>

<p>My sin isn&#39;t your concern. Nor should you be judging me or my spiritual life by claiming I&#39;m rebellious because I&#39;m resentful! </p>

Pretty much everyone just has to be on bored with WWIII. They will keep it up until it starts. It won&#39;t be a long war at all though. The Two Olive Trees wipe out some strong armies in grand fashion. </p>

<p>That is exactly what they are up to, and not only do they have man power and computer power, they also have angel power. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>God created them too, He wouldn&#39;t create His own undoing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He knows He will win, and that this is just a lesson to the rest of the Angels to stay in line forever. He will make whole everyone who deserves it, and punish for eternity those who don&#39;t make the cut. Angels were made to serve us. Not the other way around. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say those allegations in the 80ies were all wrong, and now are utterly discredited - the same as with the &quot;Boy&#39;s Town&quot; allegations.
