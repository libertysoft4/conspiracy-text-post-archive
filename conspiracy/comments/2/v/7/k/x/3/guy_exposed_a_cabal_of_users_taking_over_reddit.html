<p>Yesterday, <a href="/u/metaredditcancer">/u/metaredditcancer</a> <a href="https://archive.today/xfTJA">made a comment in /r/AskReddit exposing a cabal of users hailing from /r/Shitredditsays and other like-minded subreddits that have come to control a large part of reddit as moderators.</a> </p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2v39v2/what_popular_subreddit_has_a_really_toxic/coe8704?context=3">Permalink to comment</a></p>

<p>The AskReddit question was &quot;What subreddit has a really toxic community?&quot; and after someone replied with &quot;<a href="/r/Shitredditsays">/r/Shitredditsays</a>&quot;, <a href="/u/metareddit">/u/metareddit</a> cancer made their comment exposing the SRS moderator cabal.</p>

<p>The comment was upvoted over 2,000 times, was thrice gilded, and spawned the subreddit <a href="/r/metaredditcancer">/r/metaredditcancer</a> as a result. <a href="/r/metaredditcancer">/r/metaredditcancer</a>, the reddit corruption watchdog subreddit created as a result of the initial comment, quickly grew to over 2,500 subscribers overnight and its moderators populated the subreddit with posts explaining and exposing the depths of reddit&#39;s radical feminist and social justice warrior-filled moderator cabal composed of members of <a href="/r/Shitredditsays">/r/Shitredditsays</a>, their friends, and a few corrupt reddit admins. </p>

<p>Here are the archived posts from <a href="/r/metareddit">/r/metareddit</a> cancer:</p>

<p>Last night, <a href="/u/metaredditcancer">/u/metaredditcancer</a> was inexplicably banned from reddit by the reddit admins and this morning the admins banned the eight remaining moderator accounts of <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/metaredditcancer/about/moderators">/r/metaredditcancer.</a> The subreddit now has no moderators and <a href="https://archive.today/PZ2sY">has been requested in /r/redditrequest by the very people that the subreddit exists to expose: reddit&#39;s /r/Shitredditsays-led moderator cabal of a few dozen redditors who control dozens of subreddits with millions of subscribers.</a> </p>

<p>Reddit&#39;s admins have not responded to any inquiries as to why all of the mods of <a href="/r/metaredditcancer">/r/metaredditcancer</a> have been banned from reddit and they will soon grant control of the subreddit to the same people that the subreddit was created to expose.</p>

<p>Text of the original AskReddit comment below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SRS is actually an internet cult and they meet most of the criteria needed for being a cult. The way in which they effectively serve as an internet cult is that it is possible for anyone to easily join the cult so long as they have an internet connection and a reddit account and are willing to do exactly what they are told by the SRS moderator hierarchy and the people who control and run the subreddit. The worst thing about Shitredditsays, however, isn&#39;t that they have their own shitty subreddit that makes zero sense to the outside world and to those who are sane and don&#39;t believe in the views of social justice warriors and radical feminists. The worst thing about SRS is that they and their friends from other like-minded subreddits on reddit - with the cooperation and unspoken support of a few reddit administrators - have managed to turn reddit into Digg 2.0 where a clique of users who are chummy and friendly with each other have managed to take over a very large portion of this website. The users who have turned reddit into Digg 2.0 and who threaten to ruin the site are what I and some others who understand the situation have come to know as and refer to as &quot;metareddit cancer.&quot; I have taken it upon myself to go ahead and create the subreddit <a href="/r/metaredditcancer">/r/metaredditcancer</a> to act as a watchdog that chronicles everything that this cabal of reddit users are doing to turn reddit into Digg 2.0 and - in particular - to turn the site into a place run by social justice warrior and feminist moderators who tolerate no deviation from their beliefs in the numerous subreddits that they have come to control as moderators. </p>

<p>My hope is that after reading this comment of mine that you will subscribe to <a href="/r/metaredditcancer">/r/metaredditcancer</a> so that you can stay well-informed about a very serious situation that has arisen - largely unknown to most users - on this website so that we can all gain a greater understanding of what a powerful cabal of agenda-driven users are doing to and have done to this site that we all love. I am a long-time user on reddit who has intimate and in-depth knowledge of this cabal and who has modded multiple subreddits both large and small, who has been intimately involved in discussion with this cabal of users regarding their control of reddit, who knows what their agenda is and what they want to do with their power and control, who has sat in their private discussions in internet chat rooms, who has seen leaks from their private subreddits, and who has absolutely had enough of what they have done to reddit and of what they will continue to do to this site unless the rest of this site is exposed to who and what they are and what their endgame is. What happened to Digg and what has happened to 4chan very recently is undeniably and positively what is happening to reddit now and what has been happening here since 2012.</p>

<p>The cabal of users and moderators who I refer to as &quot;metareddit cancer&quot; hail from the subreddits Shitredditsays, circlebroke, Braveryjerk, circlejerk, TheBluePill, SubredditDrama, SRDbroke, and Drama. This cabal of users are - for the most part - the moderators of these subreddits and these users also control many other subreddits with thousands and even hundreds of thousands of subscribers. They mod subreddits like <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, <a href="/r/Subredditdrama">/r/Subredditdrama</a>, <a href="/r/creepyPMs">/r/creepyPMs</a>, <a href="/r/offmychest">/r/offmychest</a>, <a href="/r/TIFU">/r/TIFU</a>, <a href="/r/explainlikeimfive">/r/explainlikeimfive</a>, <a href="/r/changemyview">/r/changemyview</a>, <a href="/r/LGBT">/r/LGBT</a>, and numerous other subreddits where they have managed to worm their way into moderator positions over the years and then go on to have total control over the type of discussion that goes on in their subreddits. They make sure that any discussion that goes against their social justice and feminist beliefs is censored and controlled and/or they mod their subreddits like ban-happy dictators who get rid of anyone who breaks the circlejerk that goes on in their subreddits every week. This is absolutely the case with offmychest, creepyPMs, and Subredditdrama. Maybe the worst example of their way of worming into moderator positions and destroying subreddits is that of <a href="/r/LGBT">/r/LGBT</a> and how 2 transsexual radfem SRS trolls - one of which has become infamous on reddit and other chan websites - managed to take control of the subreddit in 2012 and then acted like dictators and abused their power so badly that reddit&#39;s administrators had to be called into the drama. The admins refused to remove the two SRS moderators, the LGBT subreddit went into meltdown because of them, and this led to the subreddit being ruined and people having to flock to the newly created <a href="/r/ainbow">/r/ainbow</a> subreddit because one of the biggest forums for discussing LGBT issues on the internet was taken over by members of Shitredditsays. This is the first notable time that SRS and other metareddit cancer have taken control of subreddits and they&#39;ve gone on to manipulate reddit&#39;s subreddit request system to bring even more subreddits under their control. They organize subreddit request attempts in private subreddits where they plan out their agenda and they do the same in their internet relay chat rooms as well. I can say with total confidence that there is <em>no other reddit clique and group operating on this website that looks to take over and control as many subreddits as they can in a clear and indisputable attempt to control the flow of conversation so that conversations in any given subreddit always lean and kowtow to radical feminism and a perverted form of social justice.</em> NO OTHER GROUP EXISTS that is looking to take over as much of this site as possible. </p>

<p>One of the more troubling things that I have come to understand having been an intimately involved user of reddit for years, is that some of reddit&#39;s current and past administrators support and belong to this cabal of metareddit cancer. An administrator who was fired from reddit two years ago immediately was added as a mod of Shitredditsays as soon as he left his admin role and made clear what some users had already known: he was literally a member of Shitredditsays and as an admin he used his power to carry out SRS&#39;s agenda. He routinely ostracized and terminated the accounts of (shadowbanned) people who posted in subreddits that SRS want destroyed and now he sits as a moderator of SRS. This is one of the biggest yet unknown bits of corruption in reddit&#39;s history yet you wouldn&#39;t know it because the subreddit created as a watchdog for this sort of thing - <a href="/r/Subredditdrama">/r/Subredditdrama</a> - was taken over by SRS and reddit metacancer in 2013 and they censor discussion about themselves so that people aren&#39;t aware of what is going on. The takeover of SubredditDrama is one of the worst things that has ever happened on this website because of its 150K subscriber size and because the very people who are the problem that I am discussing happen to be in control of SubredditDrama. This is clearly a monumental conflict of interest given that anything nefarious that this group of users do cannot be openly discussed in SubredditDrama without their consent. </p>

<p>What caused this  cabal to come to be and what is it that unites them in their desire to control the site through moderator power and through cliques? </p>

<ul>
<li><p>A need for friendship that&#39;s lacking in real life. A # of users involved in this cabal are depressed, aren&#39;t &quot;cool&quot;, are LGBT (more difficult to be included socially if you are a member of this group in real life), are social outcasts, or just want to have some internet friends because they spend a lot of time on this site. This last reason differs a bit from the other reasons and is different in that some users - a smaller number - belonging to this cabal get drawn into it without knowing what the agenda is and they simply just want some internet friends. However, they <em>always</em> cave to the agenda when it is brought up (perverted feminism and social justice and tightly-controlled, censorship-happy moderation in the cabal&#39;s subreddits) and so it doesn&#39;t matter that their intentions for joining the cabal were innocent. In the end, they always come around and you can already see how this is cult-like behavior. Anyone who doesn&#39;t toe-the-line and go along with the agenda is shunned or cast out. I&#39;ve spent time talking to one of them who was cast out of one of the cabal&#39;s private subreddits after realizing that the nature of the cabal and &quot;group of friends&quot; wasn&#39;t innocent and that everything revolved around feminism, social justice, and the ego-driven desire to control as many subs as possible. The scary thing about my interaction with this cast-out former member is that the cabal looks to get your name and personal information. They do this through their everyday IRC chats and in Facebook groups where some choose to take friend requests with their real names. Others use new Facebook profiles with their reddit names. This cast-out user used his real account and he knows now that a reason why they send friend invites is so that you think twice about going against them because then they have your personal info and can come after you with threats at home, work, and anywhere else.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What the users in the cabal do to gain entrance is act smug and superior (social justice, feminism, morality policing) to redditors. The cabal acts as their cool kids club that they weren&#39;t good enough for in real life.</strong> THAT IS HOW AND WHY THEY ARE FRIENDS AND WHAT BINDS THEM TOGETHER BECAUSE ANYONE CAN ACT THIS WAY.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A cabal on Digg is what led to the deterioration of the site and is what led to the migration that saw users flood to reddit. I&#39;ll be damned if I watch the same type of behavior from a group of a few dozen users continue to move reddit towards becoming Digg 2.0. 4chan has been thrown into a serious mess like this after Moot gave mod positions to authoritarian mods in the last year who now control the site given his recent abdication as site admin. Let&#39;s not let this develop further on reddit because there&#39;s a point of no return.</p>

<p>TL;DR: The SRS cabal controls too much of and is ruining reddit</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p><strong>TL;DR: A few of Reddit&#39;s administrators are corrupt and they are covering up a <a href="/r/Shitredditsays">/r/Shitredditsays</a>-led cabal of users who are turning reddit into Digg 2.0.</strong></p>

<p>Edit: ok nevermind, seems free speech exists in this sub with mod-approval only, gotcha. Wouldn&#39;t want chaos and destruction to result from people typing words in a forum, now would we. </p>

<p>Edit 2: enough with the snarky, hostile PMs too. Im ignoring all, so waste your time if you want but you wont be wasting mine. Pretty fucking sad how we are <em>permitted</em> to talk about <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, but not <em>z</em>. Cuz reasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mmmmmm....no. No, that&#39;s not what happened.</p>

<p>I could prove that to you, except the reddit admins deleted everything...so there&#39;s that.</p>

<p>I was participating in the SLC daycare shutdown well before the admins deleted everything, and I can say, based on that, that the gist of the conversation had nothing to do with harassing that building (you can hardly call it a daycare), but had more to do with analyzing publicly available information and documents.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If that even happened, it was such a small part of the conversation that day that I don&#39;t even remember it. That said, why would the reddit admins delete something because of what  some 4chan users did?</p>

<p>Keep trying...</p>

<p>EDIT: You&#39;re obviously trying to make the conversation about harassment, something that never happened.  Don&#39;t waste your time. I&#39;m done even entertaining the idea of something that never happened. Nice try. Have a good day. Bye.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You couldn&#39;t prove it to me since there is absolutely no way you could even if things weren&#39;t deleted. </p>

<p>I was also keeping up with it throughout the day.</p>

<p>We both know people called. Neither know how many, we only know the ones that posted, which almost certainly is less than who did. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t know how many times the people who got no answer called either. Could it be twice? Could it be ten times? Who knows!</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know what all of them said either. Could be just questions of how to get kids in there. Could be asking if they like fiddling kids! Also could be &#39;hey, just telling you Reddit thinks you are some black ops kid bang factory. Cheers!&#39; </p>

<p>It was also posted on Reddit and not 4chan that a couple friends had at some point broken into the building to find a room with a chair and a tv seemingly closed circuit.</p>

<p>As for the gun stuff on 4chan, I saw it myself. It was one post. Probably bologna, maybe not considering Utah&#39;s carry laws. If I&#39;m Reddit. It&#39;s time to shut the shit down before one single mentally ill person decides it&#39;s time to be a hero.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve noticed or not but Reddit doesn&#39;t have to care what you think, or care that they may err on the side of definitive caution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Strange, recently painted &quot;daycare&quot; that people in the area never saw anyone go in or out of. When it was brought up on Reddit, people were threatened (99% most likely by trolls but given Reddit&#39;s reaction, who knows...). </p>

<p>Some people called the place and the actions of the people on the phone (when they ever got someone to pick up) was very non-business like. Lies about how to get a kid admitted to the daycare were told by the person on the other end of the line. </p>

<p>People started looking up publicly available information on the ownership of the building, the business, and the beyond Geocities basic website. Reddit began deleting threads from everywhere they were posted. Somebody from 8Chan ordered them a pizza and this is now considered the <strong>greatest harassment in the history of the internet</strong>. </p>

<p>After the discussions on Reddit, activity at the location suddenly picked up, with two (and only two) kids appearing at the &quot;day care&quot; to be let in (this is while the &quot;day care&quot; is no longer even a legally registered business)</p>

<p>The entire topic was subsequently banned Reddit wide, with Reddit admins even going so far as to delete small private subs that were discussing the topic. I was a member of one and no one ever discussed or planned harassment nor doxxed anyone in the subreddit but it was still deleted. Not only that, discussions of the topic on other forums disappeared as well. </p>

<p>Now the &quot;cool kids&quot; (that don&#39;t like the users on the conspiracy sub) that don&#39;t know shit about the situation spread BS about us &quot;harassing a day care&quot; and &quot;doxxing&quot; when neither happened. </p>

<p>Who knows, I might be shadowbanned for even explaining this. </p>

<p>Too bad all that stuff got deleted when it turned into a community doxx. Thats why all that happened you know. Its not some conspiracy. I stand by my point. Whether or not it was a blacksite, doing all the crap people did was stupid. Even if they were involved in something nefarious or criminal, this is not how you go about things.</p>

<p>Doxxing is the process of finding out someone on the internet&#39;s real identity, home phone number, DOB, home address, etc. Finding out who owns a public business based on publicly published filings is not doxxing. </p>

<p>And by the way...do you even <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> like ever?

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Note to self</strong>: screenplay idea</p>

<p>Protagonist realizes lifelong petit bourgeois dream, secures location at a bargain, spruces it up, and proudly installs outdoor sign right before opening day. However, petit entrepreneur has some untimely and unfortunate turn of events. Dream stalls as protagonist suffers and struggles to get dream back on track. Meanwhile, unwitting (antagonist) neighbor slowly grows more suspicious of colorful building after months of no activity. Finally posts photo with paranoid caption on popular website which suddenly makes building and oblivious owner infamous. All sorts of freaks start calling, some even showing up at the door. Protagonist is approached by down-and-out journalist who takes up the story of all the psychopaths...while falling in love with protagonist. They make a fortune from book and screenplay and ride off into the sunset, leaving building to OP.</p>

<p>Starring: Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, Christopher Walken, Tom Waites, Harry Dean Stanton and Abby Cornish.</p>

<p>EDIT: Rated R...which means if you&#39;re under 17, then you need a chaperone over 30.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol this post got me shadowbanned. to the mod or mods who did that, you need to study retalation laws regarding free speech you may cost reddit more that karma points (self.conspiracy)
submitted just now by throwawayjustin1
Guy exposed a cabal of users taking over reddit yesterday, spawned a watchdog subreddit of 2500 subscribers overnight, was then banned by reddit&#39;s admins, all the subreddit&#39;s mods then banned, admins won&#39;t say why, and now they&#39;re handing the subreddit to the corrupt cabal of users who were exposed. by redditiscorrupt0in conspiracy</p>

<p>[–]jod1177 1 point 10 hours ago </p>

<p>What can be done to protect the integrity of reddit then? Ban the users, and put up strick guidelines and screening measures asking why they want to join? No. Use their ip address to prohibit any one from its address in signing up? No, too many ways around that. Employ paid hunter killer redditors to figure out the new accounts they are signing up with, shutting them down in a permanent game of wack a mole?</p>

<p>Being new to reddit, sounds like the work is cut out for the site administrators, and who ever approves mods. This has the potential imo to turn into a witch hunt, that the only thing that can stop it is a temporary freeze on new membership, to stop the bleeding, then eliminate the cancer, not just by banning the account, but by figuring out who these little reddit terrorists are and start taking them down where they are trying to harass people.</p>

<p>I like this site, its going to suck if a bunch of little dick insecure bitches who have nothing better to do, shuts this site down, or causes so much drama that the site is no longer fun to use. I am all for people haveing their own view points, opinions, and a place to express them and exchange idea&#39;s with one another. I dont down vote people that I dont agree with what they are saying. I appreciate counter points on issues, and debating them. Its how we learn.</p>

<p>People are so quick to get butt hurt here, because they disagree with what you are saying and down vote you like the kid at the playgroud who takes his ball and leaves cause they loose.</p>

<p>This sadly has become their main interaction with people, and is where they feel they are on equal ground or have the advantage, because truth of the matter like you said, if they acted like that in the real world, they would get their ass kicked, and probably have.</p>

<p>They can have their opinions, beliefs, feelings, im all for it. But when they start to act like Nazi&#39;s and not able to be put in check, this site will probably end up like you are fearing.</p>

<p>The only things I can think that would mabye stop it is diligence from the people approving mods, banning the accounts of the &quot;cabal&quot;.</p>

<p>A freeze on new accounts is a terrible idea, but either not giving them &quot;voting rights&quot; for a certain period of time, or give them the illusions that their votes count, observing thier voting habbits with a bot that monitors them, when they are observed being reddit terriostits going into someones page and downvoting all their stuff, shut em down.</p>

<p>I think a 30 day period for new accounts not being able to vote would help. If someone pisses you off, most sane people are not going to wait 30 days to down vote someone. Then set up monitors for &quot;bulliing&quot; votes.</p>

<p>I think that moderators that are shadow banning people, deleting peoples posts, or collabaroting against users, or subs should be banned from this site. The only way I think post should be removed is already in the reddit rules. Maybe even requiring a year of redditing before you can qualify as a mod.</p>

<p>Or find a trusted group of mods who have not partaken in the bs that was going on to be reddits own secret super mods callit the RIA, to monitor them.</p>

<p>The administrators at reddit have some tough decisions. Left unchecked, this site will go the way of myspace. (i dont know the history of digg)</p>

<p>Or will have to unfortunately go on a temporary witch hunt, clear the crap out, have a plan or system in place to prevent the crap from coming back in by changing policies on new accounts voting ability, heavely scrutinizing posts from the new users have approved by actual human mods during that time, to prevent obvious manipulation and sabatoging of the subs. That should stop the bleeding.</p>

<p>Using fire to fight fire isn&#39;t alsways the best answer, but at some point they will make it come to that. Just from reading what you had to say there is no way around it.</p>

<p>I do hope you get it figured out, because that is absolute bull shit to let a bunch of little punks ruin the site. As it is, they are going to at the least effect new membership policies. Good luck.</p>

<p>That is the exact definition of retalation, on a public forum, reddit is on us soil, and im looking into if this is in violation of first amendment rights. Or CA laws. </p>

<p>if you have any information, please let me know, im diving into this now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I rarely ever post these days. yesterday, for simply stating my opinion. (It differs from their&#39;s ) was attacked by multiple accounts bully style. numerous insulting posts assigning heinous crimes and labeling me as an angry child abuser with abusive parents. I continued to receive angry hate 12 hours after my last post. anything in cospiracy I have posted magically gets one down vote for every up vote.  It&#39;s like someone is turning reddit into a mouth piece to shepherd public opinions. I know that if your goal was to shepherd public opinions,  having a small group with many usernames would be an effective way. people are more easily convinced of something if the majority of respondents are saying the same things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a similar thing happen to a post I made.  My post was old by Reddit standards, over 24 hours old and subsequently inactive but all of the sudden it received a surge of responses (all negative in nature) from several accounts. The responses flooded in at the same time. The only way I could see this happening was from a group of people who opposed my post working together via some channel.  I attempted to sleuth and see if I could find the channel they used without success. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always been weary about hive mind things on Reddit like for example the recent vaccination posts, they seem really out of the ordinary to me and orchestrated (another example are post regarding circumcision, they quickly get flooded with people opposing it and anything in favor, science included, gets downvoted). Reddit is a powerful tool, obviously, and I feel a lot of effort has gone into controlling/manipulating it. What I experienced seemed like a small taste of that.</p>

<p>As a French man, who hasn&#39;t been circumcised and knows no one who is (because the whole thing is kinda retarded), my guess is that people in the USA have some kind of, uhh, complex where they can&#39;t accept that something wrong was done to them. So they try to justify it with every argument they find. Some of them just can&#39;t integrate that the whole thing is the result of a wide publicity campaign orchestrated by doctors who wanted a quick and easy buck. </p>

<p>And they lose a great part of the sensation that their foreskin used to let them feel; they can&#39;t masturbate properly without lube; their dick is constantly irritated until the glans&#39; skin is hardened enough to be rubbing constantly on their underwear without feeling terrible... Plus, <a href="http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/DOC/statement06.html">it has huge effects on the emotional health of people, going as far as to cause PTSD for circumcised babies; it ruins the natural lubricant in the vagina by pulling it out, and makes women who had sex with cut and uncut guys to prefer cut to uncut by a ratio of as much as 8.6 to 1; <em>et caetera</em>.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/lostlist/">I find this website to also be interesting, since it says among other things that not only you lose a great deal of sensibility; but also that &quot;The debilitating sexual consequences of keratinizing the glans have never been studied&quot;, which means that there hasn&#39;t been a single study on the negative effect of circumcision on the glans before even considering to apply the procedure to every male born in the US; and, another sentence that&#39;s hilarious to me: &quot;making the circumcised penis defectively thinner than a full-sized intact penis&quot;</a></p>

<p>But, well, I guess you don&#39;t want to know about a half of the story and only read what&#39;s there to comfort you in the choice you probably didn&#39;t make, so...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So salty that youre going out of your way to lie and use personal attacks. But thats what really secure people do right? But I guess the mountains of medical data are just a big conspiracy of greedy doctors. I guess the 80% of women who prefer it in studies done are just shills for greedy foreskin eating jews right? Do you realize how youre acting? Nobody is saying anything negative about you not being circumsized. People calmly point out the medical and aesthetic benefits and back them up with studies. You freak out and accuse everyone of being insecure about their mutilated dicks, and rant about how its all some conspiracy by greedy doctors. Talk about insecurity... Theres no need to get furious and start attacking people for having different preferences. When you get in a fit of rage and attack people for being different from you, it makes you look really insecure. </p>

<p>Okay, let&#39;s suppose for a moment that I&#39;m really &quot;insecure&quot;, whatever that means. What does it do for your argument? Does it prove anything? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I guess the mountains of medical data </p>

<p>are just contradicted by other mountains of medical data, so, you know... Objectivity isn&#39;t the doctors&#39; thing when their paydays are at stake. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nobody is saying anything negative about you not being circumsized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right, not just like that guy above who told me I was &quot;salty&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>People calmly point out the medical and aesthetic benefits</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Calmly? Like this, you mean? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>you&#39;re salty about your ugly, uncircumcised donger.
Seems you&#39;re reading into things instead of actually reading. 
Also, do you believe everything people with a title tell you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that last one, from you: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I forget that not everyone understands these things or has any common sense. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah. Right. Everyone has been REAL calm around here. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and back them up with studies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What studies? Where? I rewatched the entire list of replies I got, and, lo and behold, TWO studies only were used, and they point towards a <em>slightly lower risk of catching STDs</em>. Note that 1, this is mostly due to the penis&#39; skin being tougher because of the constant irritation, and 2, that it&#39;s &quot;of borderline statistical significance&quot;. Furthermore, <strong>those very studies say that it can&#39;t be used as a replacement for safe sex practices such as condoms.</strong></p>

<p>As for the other points? Didn&#39;t see a single fucking study.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You freak out and accuse everyone of being insecure about their mutilated dicks, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Freak out? Alright, let&#39;s say I did, because I used capslock. That was in a single post, because you have trouble understanding the definition of smegma. 1 point for you.</p>

<p>Accuse everyone? No, there was just this one guy. And I didn&#39;t accuse him of being &quot;insecure&quot;. In fact, you&#39;re the only one who uses that word. -1 for you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and rant about how its all some conspiracy by greedy doctors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s an association of movements: one of &quot;greedy doctors&quot; who just wanted easy money, and one of religious integrists who wanted to crack down on boys who masturbated. Circumcision makes it harder, so, it was an easy way for them to enforce the belief that masturbation is a sin. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Theres no need to get furious and start attacking people for having different preferences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t attack them for having different preferences, I attack them for not being able to read a fucking dictionary, not being able to restrain from using obvious logical fallacies, and not being able to properly read my posts. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you get in a fit of rage and attack people for being different from you, it makes you look really insecure. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And when you keep posting all day because someone proved you wrong over a part of your body and mocked your career, it makes you really insecure too. Guess what? Everyone&#39;s insecure here, it&#39;s amazing! </p>

<p>Ah, yes, the CDC. The corrupted organization that consistently gives opinionated and skewed &quot;studies&quot; a place where to be published and voices to repeat their results, while <a href="http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2011/06/08/making-sense-of-the-health-debate-over-circumcision">everyone else disagrees</a>. I&#39;m sure the CDC, being the most worthless health organization of a single country in the world, should be trusted as the one and only source of information on health matters. 
Furthermore, probably that most of the people at the CDC are actually circumcised, which would influence greatly their stance on the matter, as <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324798904578531063301112102">this article says</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rather than admit a serious mistake, we ignore the harm and produce endless inflated medical claims to defend our bias. <strong>Some research shows that circumcision is favored more often by circumcised physicians</strong>. If they participate in pro-circumcision studies or committees, circumcision status could influence their work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That, right there, confirms what I said earlier: most circumsized americans have a validation complex that makes them try to justify their genital mutilations because they can&#39;t face the truth. Health scientists aren&#39;t an exception, they&#39;re people too. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regardless of any of that, why cant you understand that different people have different lives?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, yes. Some people use their brains, and some others end up selling their body on the internet because they can&#39;t finish med school well enough to have a better job. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I make 15k more a month because of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s a well known fact that cutting the foreskin off of babies will make them shit out 15k dollars every now and then. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The aesthetics are more desired in my country because of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And everywhere else in the world, it&#39;s the opposite. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>My STD risk is greatly reduced because of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, your STD risk is reduced. But it doesn&#39;t really matter. Anyone with half a brain and an uncut dick won&#39;t get STDs because all you have to do is use a condom or choose other partners.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Im pretty sure I know more about my life than you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe, but you don&#39;t know anything about anything else than your life. And you don&#39;t know anything about other people&#39;s lives and the effect circumcision may have on them. You only think about yourself and your stupid job that requires cutting off a part of your dick. That&#39;s why you are what you are.</p>

Oh there you go again with the personal attacks. I have a bachelors econ/finance and biology. I have a more useful ad lucrative degree than you. I chose to drop out of med school and do something else. I didnt want to spend 5 years and 350k of my savings in med school. Just to be left with hardly any savings and working 60 hours a week for a low 6 figure salary. I wanted to earn more money and have more free time. See, thats something I learned when studying economics. Making more money for less time is a good thing. Why would I work 60 hours a week for 10k a month, when I can work 10 hours a week for 25k? Pretty easy choice. But go ahead and attack my profession because youre insecure and immature.
And stop telling me to use condoms. It is literally a job requirement not to wear them. Also, why would I wear a condom and decrease my sexual pleasure, when I have a fraction of a percent chance of getting an STD? Thats like avoding planes because youre afraid they might crash...</p>

<p>All right, I&#39;ll make this simple. REALLY simple.</p>

<p><strong>Possibility #1</strong>: your partner doesn&#39;t have an STD. You can fuck him/her however you want.</p>

<p><strong>Possibility #2</strong>: you don&#39;t know if your partner has anything. Then:</p>

<ul>
<li>Either you use a condom and avoid any potential STDs with a near 100% rate</li>
<li>Or you&#39;re a fuckin moron and you stick your dick in something that may very well be infected with a terrible STD. If you are circumcised, the lower % will barely help you. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Possibility #3</strong>: you know your partner has an STD.</p>

<ul>
<li>You abstain and get the fuck out </li>
<li>You use a condom because you still want the sex but not the STD</li>
<li>You don&#39;t use a condom, and you&#39;re a fucking moron who got himself an STD for sure. If you&#39;re circumcised, the lower percentage will barely help you. </li>
</ul>

<p>People who catch STDs are stupid, that&#39;s all. And pretending that a circumcision will save you is utterly false. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thats like avoding planes because youre afraid they might crash...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not like avoiding to take planes, it&#39;s like preferring to take the train when your plane&#39;s reactors were already burning before its departure. Keep your strawmen to yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The condom levels playing field, if both wear it they have the same chance. You should wear one because it&#39;s safer so saying its a good idea to snip is basically saying it&#39;s better to use if you want to go have risky sex, and if on the small chance a rubber breaks (they&#39;re pretty strong) you have a slightly better chance of not copping an STD. Personally I&#39;d at her just ask for an STD check and wear a rubber anyway. Seems a roundabout way of scoring a smaller percentage anyway. Seeing as female to male AIDS transmission is around 1% anyway I&#39;m not particularly scared by that, so removing my foreskin to prevent that when I wear a rubber anyway seems redundant. </p>

<p>Edit: going to take a punt and say you&#39;re circumcised right? Can&#39;t imagine you&#39;d get so touchy about something unless it was done to you. </p>

<p>Personally I&#39;d rather just wear a rubber which protects me from an STD at the same rate as a guy with the snip. I use them properly and they don&#39;t break, seems redundant to go get a permanent procedure that in that case provides no benefit. Male to female AiDS transmission is what? 1%? Mate I&#39;m more concerned about the drive over to the chick&#39;s house than that, especially with the aforementioned device that prevents it anyway.

I have unprotected sex hundreds of times a year, odds are that Ill get an STD at some point. Probably many times. If I get and STF 5 times in my life compared to 8 times, its worth it for that reason alone. Thats 3 times less Ill be sick and home from work making less money. I chose to be circumsized, I even paid a decent amount of money for it. I chose to do so because of the decreased STD risks, a bigger percentage of people prefer the aesthetics of it(in my country) increased earning based on lower STD risk that might keep me home from work, and a few other reasons. I also hate wearing a condom, as most people do. Id rather not have sex at all than have se with a condom on. So I only have sex without a condom. I never said that everyone should be curcumsized. If you dont have sex all the time and you always use a condom and live in a country where being natural is prefered, you dont have as much of a reason to be circumsized as I do. But theres no reason to pretend like the benefits dont exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have experience having sex uncircumcised, and anecdotal evidence from a couple different women I&#39;ve slept with saying that circumcised guys don&#39;t last as long. Maybe I&#39;m just a badass, or maybe my dick just works as nature intended. Don&#39;t be jealous your mutilated pecker makes you a 2 pump chump.</p>

<p>If you understood a little anatomy you&#39;d know that although the tip has the most nerve endings the foreskin is not without. Furthermore it serves as a barrier preventing overstimulation, so instead of having the orgasm come on like a light switch, it comes on as a gradual wave, and let&#39;s me know exactly how close I am to orgasm allowing me to pace myself better than some other lesser equipped male.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is extremely common knowledge that circumcision reduces sensation, causing prolonged time to orgasm. Just google it... One of the conplaints circumcized guys have and one if the main reasons people talk down about circumcision is that it takes longer to cum.

    <div class="md"><p>Think about what you&#39;re saying, how can having the most sensitive part of your penis exposed possibly lead you perform for a longer time? What you&#39;re saying goes against all legitimate research on the subject. Which basically states that it&#39;s all in your head, the one with hair and eyes, not the nerves in your wang. I will say this, I can see my orgasms from a mile away so if I want to prolong sex I can do something else and have plenty of time to react. I believe that window isn&#39;t as large with circumcised males.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the importance of the foreskin for penile sensitivity, overall sexual satisfaction, and penile functioning. Furthermore, this study shows that a higher percentage of circumcised men experience discomfort or pain and unusual sensations as compared with the uncircumcised population. Before circumcision without medical indication, adult men, and parents considering circumcision of their sons, should be informed of the importance of the foreskin in male sexuality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anti-vaxx posts are gaining popularity because the CDCwhistleblower story,  and even more so because the silence of the media and medical establishment to address the CDC fraud reinforces the idea that the CDC /vaxx industry has something to hide. So far the only reaction has been a Snopes articles that did more damage to Snopes&#39; reputation than it did to subdue the story.</p>

<p>Also, the core anti-vaxx people are parents of vaccine injured children, who are very angry that their once-healthy child is now obviously injured, and the parents have to deal with that every day. Its not like other issues where you can be upset about something one day and forget about it the next. To add insult to injury, these parents are often mocked/ridiculed for daring to suggest that vaccines had something to do with their child&#39;s injury, which very often is an almost immediate cause-and-effect called &quot;sudden onset neuro degeneration&quot;. Parents witness their child degenerate in front of their eyes and dont give a shit what the &quot;research&quot; says because they witnessed it first hand happen to some on they love. </p>

<p>The anti-vaxx movement will not go away easily, and will likely only grow as more people become aware of what is going on. We have seen the establishment concoct story after story to try to bury the CDC whistleblower scandal, from the ebola hoax, to the Disney measles hoax, to the little boy fighting leukemia who really needs you to get vaccinated because he cant...</p>

<p>And through it all, the parents saw through the lies, and became even more determined in their quest for truth and justice. </p>

<p>Im glad these anti-vaxx posts are being made. It helps people understand that vaccines are more controversial than the medical establishment would have us believe <a href="http://twitter.com/search/cdcwhistleblower">http://twitter.com/search/cdcwhistleblower</a></p>

<p>Conclusions: This first systematic review of male circumcision and ulcerative STI strongly indicates that circumcised men are at lower risk of chancroid and syphilis. There is less association with HSV-2. Potential male circumcision interventions to reduce HIV in high risk populations may provide additional benefit by protecting against other STI.

<p>What on earth are people doing with uncut junk to have this occur?</p>

<p>See, there&#39;s the problem. You seem to think that only uncut people can get dirty. Well here&#39;s the trick: it happens to everyone who doesn&#39;t shower. In other words, cut or not, it doesn&#39;t matter, your dick will still get dirty over time if you don&#39;t clean it. </p>

<p>Which brings me to the corollary: people who say that uncuts are dirtier most probably can&#39;t be bothered to clean their dicks once in a while because they&#39;re the embodiment of the foul bachelor toad. </p>

<p>As for the loss of sensation, if it isn&#39;t a bad thing, why does no one on earth anesthesize their dick before having sex? I mean, with medical grade stuff, so you don&#39;t feel a thing. It should be a viable strategy to let the woman achieve multiple orgasms, right?</p>

<p>Your claim, and the others, is that the lost sensation I&#39;m supposedly experiencing is a negative. I&#39;ve had no issues with sensation with my dick. Meaning, whatever loss there is doesn&#39;t appear to have any measurable effect on me. Or others. The loss of sensation we supposedly have is only a big deal to the uncut.</p>

<p>Should I use a numbing agent to rid myself of residual sensation in my hands, since a life of working with my hands has dulled the sensation? See the logic you use? Makes no sense does it.</p>

What I mean is that there is a lack of sensation, and it&#39;s undeniably negative. People who justify their circumcision by saying &quot;i&#39;m less sensitive so it helps me last longer in bed&quot; are just trying to find ways to justify an unjust and useless procedure. </p>

<p>Some condoms include small doses of anesthetics because of premature ejaculators (and/or people who have general troubles with the mastery of their orgasm even if it&#39;s not classifiable as premature ejaculation). All they have to do is train. Everyone is sensible, what you need is to control your PC muscle and stay focused. It&#39;s all I need to get my girl to cum 2 or 3 times before I let go. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, do you believe everything people with a title tell you? Everything you read in the internet?</p>

<p>You ask that, and then you proceed to tell me a story that has no proof whatsoever? Laughable. All I did was send you other stories, just so you understood that it&#39;s not really proof that you&#39;re bringing to the conversation. You can&#39;t seem to understand that. </p>

<ol>
<li>Increased pleasure</li>
<li>Easier penetration by means of sliding </li>
<li>Protecting the glans and ensuring it doesn&#39;t start to look like a callused foot</li>
</ol>

<p>But of course, if you don&#39;t care about either of those, fine. Cut it away and enjoy your mutilated dick. People will laugh at you in a few years, you&#39;ll see. Circumcision percentage is going down, and has been doing that steadily for 50 years. 
Plus, except for the US, no one does that in the world. You guys are literally the only country where it&#39;s done to a significant portion of people for non-religious reasons. </p>

<p>According to Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Smegma (Greek smēgma, &quot;soap&quot;[1]) is a combination of exfoliated (shed) epithelial cells, transudated skin oils, and moisture. It occurs in both female and male mammalian genitalia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we have a mix of dead skin, lubricant generated by glands inside the penis, and &quot;humidity&quot; (pee, cum, or water, whatever). Cut penises don&#39;t have any of that? Are you sure? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no dirt building up, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you&#39;re dirty enough to have smegma on your dick, there&#39;s also other kinds of dirt in general. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You also cant really say that loss of sensation is undeniable and a bad thing when youve never experienced being circumsized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well then, you can&#39;t really say it&#39;s not a bad thing if you haven&#39;t experienced being un-circumsized magically. Yay for logical fallacies!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How are you not realizing what Im saying? You can get smegma without having hygene issues or not cleaning urine/cum off yourself. Getting yourself covered in your own urine/cum is a seperate hygene issue than normal buildup of smega. You dont even get a say in this arugument considering you have no idea what its like to be circumsized. Smegma cannot build up if you dont have a flap of skin for it to build up on. Fresh smega contains squalee and prostatic/seminal secretion from the littre glands.
This does not happen for 99% of circumsized people, and it is completely different from &quot;dirty&quot; smegma that is caused by peeing on yourself and letting your dead skin cells build up from lack of hygene. Just because one anticircumcision site said &quot;does not always&quot; doesnt chanhe the fact that every single other credible source will tell you otherwise.</p>

<p>Logical fallacy. Does not stand. If I  use the same logic, I can say you don&#39;t have a say on the matter of death penalty because you didn&#39;t experience it. Pretty paradoxical, isn&#39;t it?

<p>It&#39;s not a required element for the formation of smegma. All smegma needs is skin cells, bacteria, and a little moisture to keep it all stuck together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few things I&#39;d like to mention....</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There are studies that show circumcised and uncircumcised males share the same sensitivity as well as studies that support your point. This is inconclusive and cannot be stated as fact scientifically.</p></li>
<li><p>The primary cause is a dirty diaper in children that have been circumcised and bacteria in children who have not. Change your babies diaper and this won&#39;t happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Without the foreskin there won&#39;t be an excessive buildup of bacteria. Also....
Researchers conducting immunological experiments with the foreskins of bulls have found that plasma cells in the mucosal lining of the foreskin secrete immunoglobulin. (11) The researchers <strong>hypothesize</strong> that this provides immunity from bacteria and other germs. This is likely to work the same in other mammals, including humans.</p></li>
<li><p>Sunburn? Really? I&#39;d like to know how many babies get a sunburn on their penis.</p></li>
<li><p>When searching for actual scientific evidence supported by the scientific method, I found more information about popped blood vessels in the foreskin than vascular benefits. If you&#39;re going to the arctic, wear warm clothes. Nuff said.</p></li>
<li><p>See number one.</p></li>
<li><p>Why is a rolling bearing needed? A vagina lubricates itself. If it doesn&#39;t, obgyn visit should be in the nearest future. If you&#39;re looking to stick it in someone&#39;s butt, use lube. You don&#39;t need lube to masturbate.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to the wiki page. There&#39;s a quick mention of the glans and a whole lot of mention about foreskin problems. This is just false.</p></li>
<li><p>That&#39;s what the penis does. If your partner isn&#39;t already stimulated then you moved to fast, your partner has a medical issue, or your raping someone.</p></li>
<li><p>Actually there are many issues with tightness arising from keeping foreskin such as not retracting over the glans, becoming stuck behind the glans, and drawing back to tightly causing number eight. The former two are believed to increase penile cancer risk.</p></li>
<li><p>Pheromones? Your body has glands all over it. Science is at odds with itself over the actual effect of human pheromones and there have been studies showing they have little to no measurable effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Smegma buildup around foreskin emits a strong odor when not cleaned in a timely manner. Without foreskin, it isn&#39;t needed. This argument is invalid.</p></li>
<li><p>An erection is a visual signal. So are dilated pupils, vocalizing, involuntary pelvic thrusting, etc.. You&#39;re going to know that&#39;s going on prior to seeing it.</p></li>
<li><p>Scientific backing needed. Sperm counts vary due to so many variables it&#39;s almost impossible to state this with any amount of certainty.</p></li>
<li><p>Actually, studies show that it doesn&#39;t.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>.</p>

<p>Now that I&#39;ve shown the fallacy you&#39;re stating as science, <a href="http://www.circumstitions.com/Functions.html">HERE</a> is a website with the exact verbiage you&#39;ve used. Number 11 on the website is excluded and number 16 is included. You should read some of the others above number 16, they&#39;re good examples of how important foreskin isn&#39;t. This leads me to believe you either plagiarized another website that plagiarized this one that probably plagiarized another on..... You get it. Instead of regurgitating try to research and learn about what you&#39;re stating.</p>

<p>TLDR: scientific fallacy about circumcision is set straight and plagiarism/regurgitation of information stated as fact with no scientific backing is exposed.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not attacking you, I&#39;m preventing the spread of misinformation and perpetuation of stated old wives tales. Have a good night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s balancing risk vs benefit just like everything else in medicine (nothing is 100% risk free for 100% benefits). Removing both of your breasts incurs the extra risks of surgery (even if it&#39;s a minimally risky surgery), anesthesia and post-op complications including infection and impaired lymphatic drainage. </p>

<p>Circumcision in a newborn is done without anesthesia and only with a local lidocaine(? if I&#39;m remembering correctly) shot. Sure, not fool proof, but much much less dangerous than a mastectomy. The extra public health benefits of circumcision (harder to contract and spread STDs) far outweigh the risks (see american academy of pediatrics recommendations), just like vaccinations. Of course there can be permanent debilitating consequences of immunization (e.g., Guillan Barre), but the public health benefits far outweigh the miniscule risk to a single person.</p>

<p>Most likely a private sub. I used to be in a private meta sub (we didn&#39;t vote brigade, but we were kind of like a legislative body for a larger sub) and we would routinely share posts of interest. I know for a fact that SRS &amp; co. have similar subs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is unbelievable to me. Why were the mods banned? Is it true that Reddit ADMINS are participating in this by <em>banning</em> users that decide to do things they don&#39;t personally like, or that don&#39;t sit with their views on what should constitute free speech and free thought? Please, please tell me that there is some other explanation, because I can&#39;t even begin to abide by that kind of garbage. We&#39;ll <em>all</em> find somewhere else to go, no fucking problem. Best believe it.</p>

<p>If this turns out to be true, I&#39;m ditching this piece of shit site. And I will tell absolutely everyone else I know to do the same thing.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t underestimate the power of a group of people spreading negative word of mouth. Once this places starts being seen as Digg it will quickly eat itself from the inside out. This kind of thing permanently ruins the longevity of a website.</p>

<p>Hilariously, you&#39;ve provided textbook misogyny. Like, not trying to insult you, but the post you made uses negative prejudices against specific demographics, which when applied in this manner is called misogyny.</p>

<p>No, they&#39;re not being given power. They&#39;re taking it.</p>

<p>And to be frank: You&#39;re the &quot;bitch&quot; who is &quot;crying&quot;. You&#39;re on a subreddit crying about losing power. They&#39;re the ones taking it. To be a fly on the wall when you realize they&#39;re the &quot;masculine&quot; element taking for themselves what they want, and you&#39;re the &quot;feminine&quot; element who is hiding and crying in the corner of a small subreddit, watching it get taken. Delicious, delicious irony. </p>

<p>Did they tell you that was why you were banned? The tolerance threshold for being automatically flagged for violating Reddit rules are pretty high, and when Admins target the users of a sub it seems like they just manually audit it to find violations. </p>

<p>You probably broke the rules and pissed off an admin enough to dig and uncover it. That isn&#39;t being trollish, it is taking a personal interest in upholding the rules.</p>

<p>I mean dude, imagine posting &quot;haha&quot; somewhere like <a href="/r/debatereligion">/r/debatereligion</a>. If I was a mod on that subreddit and had to deal with all the kids trying to sneak in there, then I can see myself occasionally getting aggravated enough to ban someone making a comment like that in a subreddit like that. So, you could be right, but, you could just as easily be overthinking it IMO. I don&#39;t know. Just my impression.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no big deal. I obviously still browse Reddit. I just feel like it&#39;s all bullshit behind the scenes now. Especially after posts like this. I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing Reddit implode.

    <div class="md"><p>About 4 years total, first account was shadowbanned in 8 months. I was a regular poster of OC with that account, but some mod didn&#39;t like something i wrote, somewhere, so off to the shadowbanned heap i was thrown, i didn&#39;t know what shadowbans were at the time so i continued posting for about 2 weeks. I got wind of it when i posted a really good joke and i didn&#39;t get any upvotes or even replies at all, then i was curious, then i searched around and found out about shadowbans, then i got angry, then i realised i was on another man&#39;s site where he decides what&#39;s being written, projecting sheep mentality in time.</p>

<p>Then i decided reddit was another silly place for laughs and cats, at least on 4chan when they ban you, you know it (even though that place is also going downhill with corrupt mods and removal of threads).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &#39;pro&#39; gamer gate perspective is something like this: It looks fairly obvious that this particular girl got a lot of positive coverage for things not related to the quality of her game. In fact she seems to have slept with half a dozen people who then went on to speak favourably of her game. The game itself is low budget, low ambition, short, and the whole theme of &quot;What it&#39;s like to live with depression&quot; is not convincing to people who have lived with depression. The girl is not important; merely another fraud (And some people also shame her for cheating on her boyfriend after tweeting things like &quot;if you cheat on your SO and then hide it you are raping them by lying to them about the circumstances under which you have sex&quot;). What is important is that the &#39;journalists&#39; in questions not only had sex with someone they then praised, they also rallied immediately to protect each other when the story came out, and they attacked everyone who criticized them and called them sexist and slut shamers. Gamer Gaters want to take down journalists who do things like this.</p>

<p>The anti perspective is something like this: It is sexist to discuss the game developer&#39;s personal life or her relationships with the people who write about her. Gamers have unrealistic expectations about game developers, and respond with anger when their status quo is threatened. Look at this poor girl. All discussions about ethics in game journalism is basically an extension of the same rage they directed at her.</p>

<p>I&#39;m obviously biased in favour of the former interpretation, but I don&#39;t know how else to explain the ant perspective. They want a status quo where game journalism is more about ideology and less about the details of games.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no but my sauce is being on 4chan everyday. there is a clear divide between the old 4chan and the 4chan now. you can&#39;t even post a too young for those tits thread and those girls are like 14 and up. at first i thought they just left but now i know threads get deleted immediately when they begin. there used to be tons of threads like that all the time. if it wasn&#39;t for the fact that gay threads have flooded /b/, i wouldve just thought that people left instead of being censored. then i went to 8chan and it looks exactly like the old 4chan except without cp. what&#39;s hilarious about this sjw bullshit on 4chan is you still see tons of racist threads.</p>

<p>You go to war with the army you have. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Donald Rumsfeld</p>

<p>In this case, the social subversion that comes before an overthrow/coup/civil war benefits from operating under the cover of being a &quot;left-wing&quot; movement. It is in reality no such thing, as partisanship ceases to have any relevance outside of the public sector. </p>

<p>Devoting energy to sowing distrust amongst the public is beneficial to a power structure working to keep the limelight off it&#39;s own malfeasance and graft. It also raises the index of distrust amongst the populace, making it easier to sow discord at a future date by playing this group and others against moderates until almost everyone is polarized about everything. </p>

Then a few days later, a TON of new mods came on board, who started censoring discussions that they deemed misogynist, racist, or homophobic. Moot was basically trying to tone it down. </p>

<p>The recent mod logs also show this. Where the mods would look for justifications to ban users or delete posts. </p>

<p>The whole reason why 8chan blew up was because of the mass censorship going on at 4chan.</p>

Literally every thread was filled with shit about it and it made it impossible to have any other sort of conversations. I think the gamergate movement is <em>correct</em> but overall I don&#39;t give a shit about politics and I don&#39;t want it in my videogames. Moot made the correct choice.</p>

<p>And as far as I know there isn&#39;t any proof about anything you just said; just chatlogs that are easily fabricated by those with an agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The same thing has happened to this subreddit, just FYI guys. At least 3 moderators are involved, and they (or the people participating in this) have an army of brand new alt accounts to manipulate content here, distract from real/meaningful discussion, dilute discussion, deceive people and discredit this whole online community, and prevent any meaningful issues from gaining traction here.</p>

<p>I&#39;m on a new account specifically for being banned for pointing this out and making a thread about the attack happening on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and the manipulation of free online social media websites. The same thing is happening here, this post is allowed because you haven&#39;t pointed to the same thing happening here. I&#39;ll probably be banned for mentioning this.</p>

<p>There is a team of people who have infiltrated the moderator list of this subreddit(as well as many others) and who bring the whole community down, discredit everyone, distract people from meaningful issues, dilute all meaningful discussion here with bullshit - with mod support - all on &quot;reddit army&quot;(one of the accounts is actually named that phonetically) alt accounts that spent their time bringing meaningless/useless content and conflict here to this subreddit, and spending their time doing things like connecting <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to holocaust denial, neo-naziism, and being nazi apologists. <strong>The thing is, these alt accounts don&#39;t actually legitimately believe in what they are posting or saying, which is why they will go to any length to avoid being drawn into rational discussion or dialogue about their own posts - they will simply try to practice those very tacts - diluting the discussion, distracting from the real issue, deceiving people with their tactics, and destroying credibility</strong>.</p>

<p>But the thing I don&#39;t know or can&#39;t tell is whether they are just petty &quot;social justice warriors&quot; and people from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> trying to link <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to racism and stuff to make a point with some &quot;online operation&quot; against this community and it&#39;s members (to make themselves feel good about themselves and reinforce their false beliefs in the way the world really is, to make themselves feel intelligent by attacking and trying to discredit a community of people who would otherwise make them feel stupid, by infiltrating the moderator list and posting ridiculous shit while never realizing <em>believing</em> the shit they post themselves or trying to talk about it or defend it in the comments of their threads) -- or whether it&#39;s an actual COINTELPRO type operation to link online communities with alternative information to shit that would simply cause 99% of people to dismiss everything that comes from it out of contempt, dilute it with bullshit and petty meaningless stuff, and distract people from the most meaningful issues by deceptively posting nonsense that gets attention and constantly manipulating content so their BS is on the front page(and the mods periodically sticky it to help them and ban anyone pointing out the attack on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that is currently going on).</p>

<p>It&#39;s happening here, just so you guys know. It&#39;s either people doing it for petty personal reasons to massage their own egos via the internet, or a part of the government/intelligence agencies effort to control and manipulate public opinion and prevent any major leaks or meaningful criticism from gaining traction and spreading on social media websites that impact millions of people like Reddit.com does. Either way, it&#39;s clear to anyone with a brain that this subreddit is under attack and has been infiltrated by people meaning to dilute it&#39;s content with meaningless bullshit that has no productive effect except to discredit everyone and everything posted here.</p>

<p>PS - watch this post get responded to by a handful of accounts that attack me on a personal level without responding to any points I actually made, or call me a jew, or pretend I&#39;m talking about &quot;supporting jews&quot; (to dilute this very discussion and distract people from the real points and to deceive you with fake racism and bullshit distractions from the real points I made), just watch. If they see this, that&#39;s what will happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not just here, I was looking through another conspiracy forum somewhere else, and more than half the posts were people spamming vile things about jews, muslims, black people, etc. Lots of posts about Neo-nazi&#39;s  and all that shit.</p>

<p>The thing is though, none of it was real, you could tell none of the posters believed in any of this crap, it was just all half assed nonsense. </p>

<p>Along with millions of random topic threads, to push down the legitimate ones. Stuff like: &#39;ok new topic: post pictures of horses&#39; and there would be hundreds of follow ups. </p>

<p>It&#39;s becoming the same everywhere, these forums are being snuffed out one by one.   By persistent shit posting, inciting racial hatred, or constant distraction/drama posts. Soon there will be nowhere left. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ton of new users thing has happened already. Sure, if 10% of reddit suddenly moved that might be a problem, but he&#39;s handled the site doubling in popularity suddenly quite well. My guess is a DDoS of shill army would be quite problematic, but the site is still small enough he shouldn&#39;t be much of a target. For what it&#39;s worth he&#39;s already acquired some help, so he&#39;s not alone anymore, and i the site grows enough to become a target he should already have more staff by then. Loo, it&#39;s not perfect, but it&#39;s looking a lot more promising than reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never liked this sub. It&#39;s over moderated and the users hold a toxic attitude. This sub is G rated conspiracy lite at best. None of the crazy out there conspiracys are even represented here. And if someone does post one they are mocked. Only approved conspiracys are allowed here and only 1 side of them is ever represented. Every time something big happens in the news this subreddit leans 1 way and all dissenting opinion is silenced. People are clearly pulling strings and have full control of where the discussions are heading. </p>

<p>This will never change because it is reddit, it&#39;s how people think on reddit. They bring their biases and superiority complex with them. There are literally conspiracy theorists devaluing other conspiracy theorists&#39; conspiracys. That is rediculuous. It&#39;s self censorship, and nothing will ever get accomplished through that. I was a member of this sub for about 2-3 months, I never posted, I just read. And I&#39;ve read enough to realize that I don&#39;t want to be a sockpuppet in this shitty community.</p>

<p>honestly i wouldn&#39;t even classify this sub as &quot;conspiracy&quot; any more. none of the stuff posted here is really even controversial. it&#39;s mostly just obvious fact to anyone who has bothered to put in even a little time to research it. not saying that this is bad, just that this place has changed a lot over the years as &quot;conspiracies&quot; have gone more and more mainstream.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really a shame, but the reddit admins and said cancer can do what ever the fuck they want to push their agenda. There is no 1st amendment on a private website, and even less so on a website that&#39;s run by a publicly traded company. What we see as a conspiracy by a small group of people with an unpopular agenda is more likely a corporate decision based upon the discresion of a huge bank of lawyers and PR people. I guarantee there&#39;s a reason these people are mods of 100+ subs, and it has nothing to do with their lack of personal life.  Seriously, look at the handful of people in the request page linked in OP&#39;s text wall:</p>

<p><a href="/u/AlphaWolf101">/u/AlphaWolf101</a>: mod of 58 subs</p>

<p><a href="/u/TortoiseSex">/u/TortoiseSex</a>: mod of 119 subs</p>

<p><a href="/u/Kijafa">/u/Kijafa</a>: mod of 182 subs</p>

<p><a href="/u/XVVHITEBOY">/u/XVVHITEBOY</a>: mod of 483(!!!) subs</p>

<p><a href="/u/Creep_The_Night">/u/Creep_The_Night</a>: mod of 78 subs (82 now! Yay for them!)</p>

<p><a href="/u/dustinyo_">/u/dustinyo_</a>: mod of 85 subs</p>

<p>At the end of the day we can pretty well assume that the majority of these people are full time employees of <em>someone</em> with a vested interest in the control of the flow of information on reddit. If Conde Naste weren&#39;t knowingly involved, there&#39;s no way one person would be given power over almost 500 subreddits. That&#39;s just bad form and bad business. As a for-profit company, you simply do not allow any outside player that kind of control. </p>

<p>*edit: Removed someone. Also, from the responses you can see below, I&#39;m starting to think there may be more &quot;shitty internet no-lifer nerd&quot; going on here than &quot;paid shill,&quot; but that&#39;s just my opinion. And I&#39;m not sure which is worse to be honest.</p>

<p>And yes, they should go with it ... and they do go with it. These people arent going to turn down privilege but theyll point to others with more and call foul. 
Once i met a feminist in ATX. She was from a very affluent area near Houston. Her parents paid for school, apartment, and expenses. I told her how my life was becoming so amazing and promising thanks to engineering school. She asked how my lifes passion would help the oppressed. She looked dumbfounded when i told her that my efforts may or may not directly or indirectly help people, but in career, i wont consider the oppressed: its not my job, id be poor at it and can better serve the world through becoming the best engineer i can be. Then she tells me the only reason i can do what im doing is because im a privileged white male. (This coming from her, a rich white girl who grew up in a tiny community, unexposed to various types of people).</p>

<p>Then i shut her up by saying &quot;so what? Ive got a leg up being white and male in America, so why not just go with it and maximize my potential? &quot;</p>

<p>Being privileged doesnt mean one becomes an asshole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No</p>

<p>Our use of SJW most certainly does not imply anything about society or justice let alone social justice. Its a derogative term (now) to be used for those who fit the bill. </p>

<p>Saying that we scoff at social justice is putting words in my mouth. Your trying to smear my ideas by implying i dont care about the prosperity of society. I do. But SJWs are a cancer that needs treatment. They don&#39;t change the world. They just repost others&#39; ideas and fail at debating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, very interesting.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2u2wrf/how_did_switzerland_supply_itself_with_food_and/co50jjh">This comment</a> on <a href="/r/AskHistorians">/r/AskHistorians</a> got me banned.  It said</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_Germany_%281939%E2%80%9345%29#Switzerland">Switzerland <em>did</em> trade with the Nazis</a>, but Germany was starving too and mostly paid Switzerland in coal.  Starving Europe was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_Germany_%281939%E2%80%9345%29">central component</a> of the Allied strategy throughout the war.  A number of European famines and at least some of the Holocaust murders would not have happened had the Allied forces refrained from this brutal collective punishment.  These deaths were foreseen by people in Allied countries, but the Allied militaries went ahead and did it anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ban message said the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you have been banned from posting to <a href="/r/AskHistorians">/r/AskHistorians</a>: AskHistorians.
note from the moderators:
&quot;Blaming Nazism&#39;s crimes on Allied strategical goals is Nazi-apologeticism&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I replied with the following, but never heard back:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think that&#39;s an unfair reading of what I wrote. By saying that the starvation strategy played a forseeable causal role in Holocaust murders, I&#39;m not saying that it was acceptable for the Nazis to commit those murders.
For instance, ethnic violence was a forseeable consequence of the US invasion of Iraq, but to note that is not usually taken as an apology for the murders ISIS has committed.
I&#39;d be grateful if you&#39;d rescind the ban. Leave the comment deleted if you like, I don&#39;t really care. I won&#39;t cause such disturbance again, and it was not my intention to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no but in the metaredditcancer sub, they mentioned a few people who got doxxxed. the person threaten to do all those things to a mod and so he closed down some anti srs sub. also, in the gamergate situation, that zoe woman did that to someone and completely ruined his gaming initiative for women and ruined his reputation. the zoe situation was extremely complex and involved so i can&#39;t really retell that story now. the gist of it is, the guy was creating a program where female game designers can tell the group their idea and get to direct a game development. zoe joined it and began disparaging it for misogyny or some bullshit and ruined its reputation. basically she didn&#39;t want any other women to get a chance to make a game so she can be the special snowflake female game designer and sell her shitty &quot;barely a game&quot; game to people. that was what spark the entire gamergate movement now. it was the final straw and it made many people angry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would just like to point out that a lot of female oriented discussion is also censored and derailed, any comment that has to do with the biological reality of being a woman will have the user labelled as a &quot;transphobic&quot; &quot;TERF&quot; and usually censored or banned, along with threats and dehumanizing labels.</p>

<p>The sad part is this is why so many people have the belief that this is what feminism has come to and understandably want nothing to do with it, as it has become popular as a form of identity politic, and ironically, an excuse to tear down and shame women who do not adhere to a narrow and often arbitrary set of politically correct standards. </p>

<p>Social justice on the internet and university clubs/cliques seems to allow for a lot of toxicity. Professional social justice advocates are so far removed from what you accurately describe as political cults.</p>

<p>Professional social justice advocates do not merely advocate around questions of social justice. Like cultists, they preach a doctrine, seek converts, and condemn nonbelievers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While discussing the SLC fiasco inside of this thread, I came to a realization that would explain why the SRS Brigade and the like are given carte blanche to run roughshod over Reddit and why there may be nothing we can do about it. </p>

<p>Advance Publications (reddit&#39;s majority shareholder and parent company of former sole owner Condé Nast, bastion of such weighty, free thinking publications as Vogue, Details, Glamour, Vanity Fair, and W, whose president sits on reddit&#39;s board) has a social agenda to push. The admins are under orders to &quot;encourage&quot; the hivemind of the SJW/SRS subs by the majority shareholder, represented by one person on the board. Hell, they may not even need to be encouraged to do so. They may know the agenda by heart and support it wholly.</p>

<p>For this reason, the users and mods of those subs are installed into certain subs (that would otherwise encourage a breaking of the hivemind) as moderators whenever possible, unencumbered by any sense of fairness and drunk off of the power that they long to have over people in their real lives. They don&#39;t have to be in on the agenda because they have internalized it already and anything that goes against it will be met with ridicule, mockery, deletion, and shadowbans. </p>

<p>If this is true, and let&#39;s be honest it explains why the admins turn a &quot;blind&quot; eye to all of this pointed out here, and why all of this that OP talks about happened, then RIP in Peace Reddit. Unless someone in here can change the agenda of Conde Nast, then Reddit as a forum for free thinking and free wheeling hijinks is dead.   </p>

<p>EDITs: Corrected ownership info and adjusted accordingly </p>

    <div class="md"><p>myth: Condé Nast owns reddit.
reality: reddit is not owned by Condé Nast. reddit used to be owned by Condé Nast, but in 2011 it was moved out from under Condé Nast to Advance Publications, which is Condé Nast’s parent company. Then in 2012, reddit was spun out into a re-incorporated independent entity with its own board and control of its own finances, hiring a new CEO and bringing back co-founder Alexis Ohanian to serve on the board. The best characterization might be to say that reddit is a “part-sibling-once-removed” of Condé Nast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m gonna put the TL;DR up top:</p>

<p>TL;DR They&#39;ve spent years indoctrinating malleable minds subtly through print publications. Now that print is dying, the internet presents their opportunity to continue to subtly shape the social agenda. Using an internet forum such as reddit allows them wide range access to people. Shaping the forum to their ideas ensures that other people will either be indoctrinated or leave. </p>

<p>Conde Nast as a publisher of print magazines (and it&#39;s parent company by extension), has long held the power to shape malleable minds (both men and women). Through the direct slant they put on editorials, the choices of who/what to profile, and their choices of what to highlight in fashion, those malleable minds are informed of how they should feel, think, and look to be a real woman or man. </p>

<p>If you are aware of how to recognize slant in media publications, just go to your local bookstore (if you have one) and flip through some of their stuff: you&#39;ll see the slant immediately. And then come back to reddit. You&#39;ll find the same type of views in the &quot;cancer&quot; group highlighted in the original post. </p>

<p>Conde Nast knows that print media is dying and they don&#39;t want to see their influence come to a silent halt. Their captive audience they had in the 80s/90s/into the 2000s is no more. Back then, if, for instance, a woman wanted to know what was fashionable, or was going to be, she had few choices but to pick up an issue of Vogue or other fashion mags. Same for men with GQ. </p>

<p>Once they were there for the clothes, watches, or whatever, they would probably wander to the articles at some point, where they would find the subliminal spin.  </p>

<p>Now Conde Nast needs to find a new way to gain this influence. The internet presents them a boondoggle: They can run their stuff online and keep that influence alive, but there are many that would just show up for the fashion and ignore their articles. So what is a publisher to do?</p>

<p>Buy up a massive internet forum and encourage power to be given to people that have already internalized the agenda through years of the subtle indoctrination. They will take care of the rest. </p>

<p>So as the bias of the mods online go, so goes the website. Anything not meeting their specific world view gets shut down, either by mods themselves or through the use of brigading, ridicule and mockery. Anyone espousing a different view from them is bullied into either leaving the site or changing their views.</p>

<p>Yeah, that&#39;s the shitty thing about a reddit exodus that I see happening. When digg shat the bed, EVERYONE left because it wasn&#39;t just an ideological agenda it was a really bad UI change that everyone hated across the board. This time, what is going to happen or has the potential of happening is the dissenting voices are going to leave but the vast majority are going to stay further insulating the echo effect.</p>

<p>But as for my question of <em>why</em> SJW stuff would be on the agenda for Conde Nast, and then pushed down to the mods, beyond the fact that it has been their agenda in the past through print media, I still don&#39;t fully understand other than it being understood as feminism being used as yet another tool of the elites to cause infighting amongst the plebs.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh you were asking why it&#39;s their agenda. My bad...</p>

<p>The people running the media today grew up during the 60s. They deeply internalized the revolutionary aims and identity politics of the counter-culture movement(s) and it has shaped their viewpoints for the rest of their lives. And they truly believe that their way of seeing the world should be everybody&#39;s way to view the world. </p>

<p>Now whether or not they have internalized the &quot;race war&quot; that will topple &quot;white Amerikkka&quot; (a key feature of some counter culture movements) or that they need to divide us to subjugate us is questionable. It may be that they just want their ideology to outlive them in the hopes that one day it will be the only ideology, that the next generation of SJWs can bring the revolution that they could not. It depends on how deep you think the conspiracy goes.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>SRS&#39;ers are fucking cancer.  </p>

<p>Make no mistake, though, OP, they are ruthless, brutal, and effective.  The CIA could learn a thing or two about cyber espionage from them.  Some probably have a great number of usernames. They have been known to doxx people, brigade threads, and completely get away with it.  I&#39;ve seen this kind of behaviour documented on <a href="/r/SRSsucks">/r/SRSsucks</a> for a long time.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen reddit users and moderators get shadowbanned for something then see an SRSer doing the same thing but far worse.  They have frequently gotten control of an entire subreddits then toxify them with their ideology from the inside. <a href="/r/subredditdrama">/r/subredditdrama</a> is a perfect example of this.</p>

<p>Just watch yourself.  Make sure your username has absolutely no tie to you personally.  People have lost their jobs because of rad fems.  They&#39;re like PETA but instead of hating factory farming and fur.... they hate white men.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t have believed this before, but I got banned from advice animals for saying &quot;You said that like women actually care about our feelings&quot; in the context of talking to a guy about bad treatment by an exgirlfriend (that had long ago dumped him). I think we can all agree that ex&#39;s regardless of gender don&#39;t tend to care. I was called a misogynist and banned by some thundercunt despite getting gold for the post, despite the fact that I&#39;m not a dude! And I&#39;ve seen that kind of crap happen repeatedly to other people, I don&#39;t have a problem with feminism I have a problem with group-think and censorship. It&#39;s a fucking subreddit based on being humorous, yet the mods ban you for joking around? Fuck the SJW movement, their censorship obsession is a plague on the future of free speech. </p>

<p>When I was like 15 or 16, I had this idea that I could pretend to be offended by everything in order to cast some light on how politically correct everything was getting and maybe help people see how ridiculous it was. I abandoned this idea when I saw that people were already doing it and they weren&#39;t pretending. And not everyone thought that those people were ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its a way of enforcing group-think. People who have no individuality but need to align themselves to some &quot;cause&quot; will pick names that show their loyalty to the cause.

Since my mom is a trendy appeaser she is judging me harshly the entire night as the chronically offended person appears to be offended and disgusted at everything that I say.  So I have to deal with this constant ridicule and then I get it once again from my vapid sellout mother for making someone upset.  Since she doesn&#39;t have real taste of her own she only knows that a person was offended and to her there must be something to that.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not. For all the bitching about brigading and censorship, the stuff SRS highlights is still routinely voted to the top of threads and subs. I guess some people are upset that racial slurs were barred from AskReddit, like the n-word or other epithets are really necessary for &quot;open dialog&quot;.</p>

<p>in <a href="/r/RedditRequest">/r/RedditRequest</a>, if a mod is inactive for 3 months, you can take over the sub.</p>

<p>I would try to get him removed. Although I know you won&#39;t be able to. He is only here to record the modmail, and maintain control of a bunch of subs of interest. Like <a href="/r/4chan">/r/4chan</a>, and <a href="/r/Funny">/r/Funny</a> and <a href="/r/Scientology">/r/Scientology</a> and <a href="/r/Tumblr">/r/Tumblr</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been taking a break from the sub because I feel it has become stale and predictable. It&#39;s become a bland vanilla shell where about 1 to 2% of the submissions are worth even bothering with. The good self posts are still there and can still be pretty good, but they are such a rarity now.</p>

<p>After reading this I feel it has just confirmed what a lot of us in here already knew, reddit is on the decline and it&#39;s useful life-cycle is coming to an end. </p>

<p>All the bots, shills, vote manipulation, topic suppression and other bullshit going on here is simply wearing thin for me, reddit did not used to have all this bullshit, I am tired of it.</p>

<p>I am going to check out Voat and see what develops there, it seems like a place I can get behind and support the best I can. </p>

<p>Besides, I can probably get my old name back there, the one that got banned for bullshit reasons here a couple years back. The one that got the ban hammer for saying bad things about facebook. Shit that turned out to be true of course.;-)</p>

<p>And also why i delete and create new accounts monthy.  cant trust those trannies not to try to dox you and try to ruin your life.  </p>

<p>This place is getting worse then 4chan.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right, I said it.  SRS has made this place <em>worse</em> than the &#39;internet hate machine&#39;.   </p>

<p>Really, when you get down to it.  This is all Something Awful&#39;s fault.  They brought this cancer to the internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve mentioned this before, but I&#39;ll say it again.  Reddit needs a way to let users determine who gets to &quot;filter and hide&quot; content.  Right now the moderator positions are just to powerful and corruption is happening.  If moderators can only hide content, but you can determine which &quot;moderators&quot; get to hide or filter content, then they really have no power other than hiding content from users who request that they hide content (e.g. filter).</p>

<p>in the process, its a grey area so far, the fact they are based on us soil and a public forum, thier rules were not broke, if admins dont respond to the report then there might be something there. I will post it when I know for sure, I think its almost comical the people here wanting to silence people and for writing their beliefs and opinions need their own tv show. this is america, where freedom of speech is gaurenteed, if you have the money,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Censorship. </p>

<p>Reddit is a site that many people read. When you read things, your thoughts reflect what you&#39;ve read, regardless of whether or not you&#39;re aware of it. These people control narratives across numerous subs through censorship and shadowbanning, ultimately leading to people having a skewed view of what others think and say on this site. </p>

<p>This is a BIG DEAL. I honestly would have passed this up as being kind of out there had it not been for the subreddit ban and mod change, but that really gives this some solid credence. </p>

<p>There are people (possibly controlled by corporate/govt interests, possibly paid) who literally keep people from being able to post openly on this website, and this ultimately affects how users think and act both on and offline. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, if this is true and reddit&#39;s moderators and, by implication, admins are starting to pay more attention to the casual racist, sexist, etc comments that give this site such a bad name everywhere else on the internet, to the point where it&#39;s embarrassing to even mention in some circles that I enjoy using it, then that&#39;s the healthiest cancer I&#39;ve ever heard of. Cracking down on pointless, hurtful insults is not the same thing as stifling free speech.</p>

<p>Edit. <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/545959/Online-ASBOs-Twitter-Facebook-users">This is what actual censorship looks like</a>. The key thing is <em>who</em> is doing the policing. Unless you think this &quot;cabal&quot; are all government agents, reddit cleaning up its act is not the same thing at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ahh. See it goes both ways. If a person is willing to represent your goal.. you can use them . People like you have painstakingly profiled are indeed archetypal of corruptible and useful fools. </p>

<p>For everything else you let robots do the work. The plebs who still read the message board actually believe they are seeing real discussion. What they are seeing is actually where the robots and useful fools intersect. It is self perpetuating. And it is strange that it seems they have now set up a proxy-army of people who believe they know whats going on in the world and how bad it is.</p>

<p>But that is all they are reaching them with. It I&#39;d another matter of control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I clicked this thinking it would be super interesting, because I expected the &quot;cabal&quot; to be more outright political in nature. For instance, pushing the agendas of big government powers, or something of that nature. </p>

<p>Nope. Instead it&#39;s just another shitstorm about the &quot;evils&quot; of social justice. </p>

<p>Look, I&#39;ll spell this out as simply as I can. This. Does. Not. Matter. </p>

<p>Who in their right mind gives a flying fuck about what SJWs are doing? </p>

<p>Want to know why your little subreddit was banned? Because it was promoting witch hunting, which is plainly against reddit&#39;s rules, and has been since the sites inception. </p>

<p>There are very real issues in the world today facing the entire human race. Issues that this subreddit could do well fighting against. Remember that video of the two children speaking out against a pedophile ring? Remember the atrocities our (and many other) governments commit every day? </p>

<p>And <em>THIS</em> is what gets stickied? Sjw witch hunting? Fuck. </p>

<p>This is the simplest trick on the books. Divide and conquer. If we&#39;re too busy jerking each other off about Tumblr feminists, and &quot;fighting the good fight&quot; against people who get offended too easily, then I&#39;d say the masses are placated successfully. </p>

<p>Fuck this subreddit, fuck the gamer gate circle jerk, fuck the meaningless distractions. </p>

<p>Not once in my life, although I make it a point to try not to use fad words.  For example, as much as I hate &quot;SJWs&quot;, I try to never actually use the term &quot;SJW&quot; and instead pick apart the actual ideals that the specific person in that instance supposedly stands for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given the fact that the guy had over 12 alt accounts, it&#39;s possible that he was using those bots to upvote himself. The way the upvotes started flying in on his AskReddit post also seemed quite fishy. </p>

<p>There is also a possibility he&#39;s an alt of <a href="/u/KamensGhost">/u/KamensGhost</a>, who, ironically, is guilty of the same types of crimes he claims to be against (KG infiltrated dozens of nonpolitical subreddits like <a href="/r/xkcd">/r/xkcd</a> and used his mod position to shill his own political agenda relating to the Holocaust, banned any users that disagreed with him, and more). The writing style appears consistent, right down to his use of key words and his choice of redditors to call out. I&#39;m surprised this is getting so heavily downvoted when this is such an obvious false-flag. </p>

<p>Another one of KG&#39;s alt accounts was <a href="/u/red321red321">/u/red321red321</a>, who created a subreddit called <a href="/r/redditinsider">/r/redditinsider</a>, using the same &quot;generate drama in an AskReddit thread and get them all to subscribe&quot; approach. </p>

<p>How about we wait for the facts to come in before jumping to wild, unsubstantiated conclusions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>sorry, but sometimes in a line of argument, no matter how rational-seeming or enticing to my worldview or potentially insightful, there is a phrase or two that gives away the icky, emasculated, paranoid populist underside. </p>

<p>&#39;the government is in the clutches of an elite media and corporations. they have no real interest in bettering the lives of people but only serving their own disgusting self-interest and the interests of those that line their pockets <strong>btw they&#39;re all zionist jews</strong>.&#39; </p>

<p>&#39;X phenomenon is just a stepping stone to a new world government and once the mechanisms of control are in place, all that will be left for the ruling class to do is flip the switch. Seeds are being planted for eventual collapse like GMOs, environmental pillaging, the passing of laws that further infringe on privacy and grant authoritarian power to governing forces. <strong>btw it&#39;s all a Marxist, commie pinko plot to take my money and job</strong>&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;There&#39;s a problem on reddit. People are abusing their power, creating a clique with a near-mob mentality that is creating a toxic corner in our internet community that could spread and hurt our rights to free speech online. <strong>btw they&#39;re radical feminist SJW bitches that don&#39;t help people and hate men and do nothing else.</strong>&#39; </p>

<p>What on earth are people doing with uncut junk to have this occur?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See, there&#39;s the problem. You seem to think that only uncut people can get dirty. Well here&#39;s the trick: it happens to everyone who doesn&#39;t shower. In other words, cut or not, it doesn&#39;t matter, your dick will still get dirty over time if you don&#39;t clean it. </p>

<p>Which brings me to the corollary: people who say that uncuts are dirtier most probably can&#39;t be bothered to clean their dicks once in a while because they&#39;re the embodiment of the foul bachelor toad. </p>

<p>As for the loss of sensation, if it isn&#39;t a bad thing, why does no one on earth anesthesize their dick before having sex? I mean, with medical grade stuff, so you don&#39;t feel a thing. It should be a viable strategy to let the woman achieve multiple orgasms, right?</p>

<p>Shaping the forum to their ideas ensures that other people will either be indoctrinated or leave.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, that&#39;s the shitty thing about a reddit exodus that I see happening. When digg shat the bed, EVERYONE left because it wasn&#39;t just an ideological agenda it was a really bad UI change that everyone hated across the board. This time, what is going to happen or has the potential of happening is the dissenting voices are going to leave but the vast majority are going to stay further insulating the echo effect.</p>

<p>But as for my question of <em>why</em> SJW stuff would be on the agenda for Conde Nast, and then pushed down to the mods, beyond the fact that it has been their agenda in the past through print media, I still don&#39;t fully understand other than it being understood as feminism being used as yet another tool of the elites to cause infighting amongst the plebs.  </p>
