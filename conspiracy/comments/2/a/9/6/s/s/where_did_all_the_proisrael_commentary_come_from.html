<p>I agree the mood has changed massively over the last 7 days.</p>

<p>Oddly enough I think that (in general) quieter subs are much more moderate than the defaults that get targeted by (?).</p>

<p>F&#39;rinstance I actually lurk <a href="/r/israel">/r/israel</a> lots (<a href="/r/palestine">/r/palestine</a> too) and in general - although things are obviously a bit tense now - zachof..., yamil... and rosinth.. etc. go down pretty badly there, moderates think they are dickheads too.</p>

<p>The vote manipulation on the big news subs does not correlate to anything except co-ordinated action, or an army of mindless redditors who really don&#39;t know fuck all but will click where the trends trend.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t know one way or the other but both prospects are kind of depressing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>*In the most serious single incident, seven Palestinians including two children were killed and about 25 wounded in an attack on a house in the Khan Younis area in south Gaza.</p>

<p>Residents said the house belonged to the family of a Hamas member and the casualties occurred when the property came under attack for the second time.</p>

<p>After the first strike people had gathered on the roof of the house as &quot;human shields&quot;, hoping their presence would deter a second strike, the residents said. The Israeli military made no immediate comment about the incident.*</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/08/israel-pounds-gaza-against-hamas">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/08/israel-pounds-gaza-against-hamas</a></p>

<p>Is Hamas sticking people on roofs, or are they standing in the way of fire to prevent further bombardment? And whether these &quot;human shields&quot; are defending their homes of their own accord, or by force, to dissuade the war crime of double-tapping a target, why is Israel striking their homes?</p>

<p>Even if we exclude the healthcare professions you&#39;re envisioning, a vast vast majority of non-medical doctors agree with my stance.

<p>Bullshit. Have you forgotten how suicidal oppressed people can be? Women and children regularly volunteer for suicide bombing missions. In fact, women are many times more likely to use a suicide bombing as an assassination attempt than men, who blow themselves up less strategically. </p>

<p>The only reason Israel isn&#39;t suicide bombing Palestine is that they have way more options available to them, thanks to Western funding. </p>
