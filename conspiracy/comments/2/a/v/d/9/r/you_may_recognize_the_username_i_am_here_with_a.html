        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi! My name is not important, and I definitely don&#39;t want ANY attention so please don&#39;t ask. What is important is a story that I was asked by a friend to post. My friend owns this Reddit account, and believes that it got him where he is today. I cannot tell you how long I knew the guy because then they will come for me. But I promised him that when I got out I would put the story out. Please share this where appropriate.</p>

<p>My friend states that he found evidence of a nuclear coverup and posted it to this site a couple years ago. Shortly after it took off he got a knock on the door, and it was two federal agents with an unmarked cop car that had a cop car cage in it. They sat him in the back of the car, and searched his house. He tried to post to Reddit since they didnt search him, and refused to show a search warrant or what it was about.</p>

<p>They claimed that he did something with occupy that was construed as a &quot;terrorist threat&quot; and an issue of national security. He says this is bullshit, that is was all over the nuclear thing and they are trying to keep him quiet. They won&#39;t let him talk to a lawyer, and keep saying that they can hold him indefinitely until they decide on the charges. They told him the patriot act allows them to hold domestic terrorists without charge and without lawyer. He has no mail and his family might think he is dead (I will be emailing some of his family to fill them in). </p>

<p>The facility he is kept at has military people as guards. It is within a 3 to 4 hour bus ride from Indianapolis. The windows on the bus are blocked and you can&#39;t see where they take you until you are in a garage. When I was released, they used the same bus to drop me off at Greyhound in Indianapolis and it was about 3 to 4 hours of riding. I can not tell you how long ago this was because I dont want them to know who I am. </p>

<p>I will not reply to this. I have no more details to share. I had to learn to use TOR to post this just so I don&#39;t go back. </p>

<p>He&#39;s probably not in the back of a cop car, and he was probably never arrested. He&#39;s simply a sad human with incredibly dangerous delusions of self-importance. He needs psychological treatment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was completely debunked. I remember this mess when it happened. He legit had reddit up in a panic that hundreds of thousands of people were about to die from radiation poisoning. Basically, the abnormal reading was from a <em>single sensor operated by a private company not affiliated with any nuclear regulatory agency.</em> When people called him out on that, he pulled some random data from the EPA&#39;s radiation system and deliberately misrepresented the totally unrelated data to make it appear as though the sensor was legit. People with degrees in nuclear engineering (as in, people actually qualified to interpret and analyze such data) explained in great detail why he was totally wrong in the original thread that was linked to. Trigger, obviously, totally ignored everyone telling him he had no idea how to interpret the data, and moved the discussion to his own subreddit so he could ban anyone who told him he was wrong. </p>

<p>He then claimed that he was in the back of a cop car and posted an AMA thread, claiming the cops didn&#39;t take his cell phone. Which, you know, is pretty much impossible, since searching a suspect and taking all their possessions is the first thing any cop and especially a federal agent would do. If the government thought he was a threat to national security and involved in terrorism, the last thing they&#39;re going to do is let him tip off his co-conspirators that he&#39;s been arrested, especially since this new post seems to make it sound like they were trying to disappear him. </p>

<p>He obviously has some serious mental disorders (he was awake for the entirety of the mass hysteria, which lasted more than 48 hours. He indicated that he doesn&#39;t need sleep and stays awake for weeks at a time, a very common feature of schizophrenia, and displays other classic symptoms such as delusions of grandeur and a belief that he is being persecuted by the government). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truthfully no. The new reddit formatting (<em>I think it&#39;s new</em>) makes everything super grey when deleted and while some people might be able to read it I can&#39;t. My eyes aren&#39;t awesome and it looks like a blur of text to me. I wish they wouldn&#39;t have made that change. It&#39;s really fucking hard to try and read.</p>

<p>EDIT: Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have even commented back but I really really hate this new grey out thing. It&#39;s super hard for some people to read. I guess I could copy it into Word but I don&#39;t feel like doing that for everything I want to read.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, i&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m way too poor to be a mole. </p>

<p>Anyway, I was just referring to this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE: According to some swift research done by &quot;CivAndTrees,&quot; &quot;sidewalkchalked&quot; and &quot;TPbandit,&quot; OCDTrigger is incarcerated. A department of corrections source has him cited for UNLAWFUL POSSESSION OF SCHEDULED DRUG (D)- 3 counts. His earliest release date is 7/31/12, but he could be in there for approximately one year. A district court source from March has him incarcerated for &quot;operating while license suspended or revoked&quot; and &quot;violating condition of release,&quot; so he does have a prior arrest record. However, before writing him off as a criminal, I&#39;d like to remind you that he was arrested FOUR days after breaking the nuclear cover-up story.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whatever you believe is up to you, but honestly the story he posted two years ago is a lot more interesting and important to me than this one. My guess is that he got out of jail, logged into reddit, saw the last post he made, and came up with a good wall of text.  Reddit is notorious for censorship, yet he hasn&#39;t been shadowbanned and the original post hasn&#39;t been deleted- yet he was whisked off as a terrorist for posting it? It just makes no sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I know the government covers things up all the time! But in this case, all the damning evidence is still sitting there in a 2 year old post for anyone to look at. What&#39;s the benefit of locking this guy up in a cage indefinitely but not deleting the post? That&#39;s what creates the doubt for me. </p>

<p>And seriously, the drama of it all! &quot;I&#39;m a friend of his and I was released&quot; from a secret government facility? Really? And they&#39;re not monitoring your behavior to keep you from doing exactly what you&#39;re doing??</p>

<p>&quot;I had to learn how to use tor to do this&quot; Is that so? Because you know, there&#39;s <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-the-nsa-targets-tor-users">this.</a></p>

<p>Let&#39;s just think about it for a minute. This mystery cell mate promises OCDTrigger not to go to the press, or contact his family, or 100 other things that may actually help him, he promises to log in with OCDTrigger&#39;s username and password to post a single text to a handful of subs and then make a point to say that he&#39;s not going to respond to anything. So why bother learning to use Tor?? You could have just gone to any friggin library, posted the thread and left. It&#39;s just all so spy-novel. And what good does posting here to? Is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> going to rally up and save him? He&#39;d be better off posting on 4chan tbh. Maybe anon would help him.</p>

<p>It made sense to me why an atheist would reject Jesus, but why would Jews reject Jesus? So I asked....</p>

<p>Needless to say, the Jews I asked were not very receptive to my inquiry, probably because they assumed I was trying to evangelize to them... which is how I accidentally discovered that they really, really dont like that.... so if you want to get under someone&#39;s skin, now you know how.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so he&#39;s not implying Fukushima like I previously thought. I confabulated the two events. I believe he&#39;s saying that he suspects solar radiation or possibly a pole flip? He has a ton of evidence that points to a huge release of radioactive material, from entirely reputable sources. So that much is very clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to point out something.  From the first portion of the post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My friend states that he found evidence of a nuclear coverup and posted it to this site a couple years ago. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And from the end of the post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I was released, they used the same bus to drop me off at Greyhound in Indianapolis and it was about 3 to 4 hours of riding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;<em>My friend</em> states.&quot;  &quot;When <em>I</em> was released.&quot;  So is the guy writing this the friend, or the account owner?  This is a troll, and one who doesn&#39;t know how to copy edit their posts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s a friend who had been locked up before, and said they used the same bus to drop him off from jail, that brought his friend to jail.  Either one of two things it sounds like he&#39;s trying to say.  He was arrested in the past for some similar bs charge, and he remembers the bus that eventually released him looks just like the one that picked up his friend.  Or possibly he was in holding with this guy, became friends with him, learned his story, was released, and got his password and is telling us this now.  Because it&#39;s scary when you&#39;re locked up for something you know isn&#39;t true, hence the use of Tor, which this guy may not be up on, but Tor very likely may still be compromised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And the fact that he posted this to three other subs over the course of about 30 minutes?  One of which is a default sub?  If he&#39;s trying to hide, that&#39;s a REALLY fucking bad way of doing it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but this whole thing just stinks of some kid in a basement playing people along.  If he was actually detained for posting something about this, don&#39;t you think that the original post would have been removed by now?  It&#39;s still there in his post history, as is all the stuff he wrote in the sub he moderates, <a href="/r/astonishing">/r/astonishing</a>.  Do you really think that the government would go to the trouble of arresting the kid for what he wrote on reddit, and not remove what he wrote?  If it was that dangerous, they&#39;d snag it as soon as they could so as few people as possible would read it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s not trying to hide, he went on Tor, and posted it as much as possible and got out.  I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s legit, but this is what he&#39;s trying to portray to us.  And the argument that they would just remove it is null and void, because there are caches of everything on the internet everywhere, and removing it would just create more suspicion.  I do think the government would do just that, because it discredits anything and everything he had or has to say, problem completely solved in the easiest manner.  Oh, he&#39;s just a druggy, look at this, he asked about loans before, likely he <em>is</em> a crackhead.  People have been killed going back to the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s for trying to reveal such events, so to say they wouldn&#39;t go to such lengths, I&#39;m guessing you haven&#39;t read all the info about how paid shills are everywhere, including here, trying to manipulate internet opinion.  Why the Government is active in the business of misinformation of its own people is really beyond me, unless there is so much corruption and cronyism that it became such a necessity.</p>

I learned that this guy is probably on meth or something and almost got reddit as a whole into their own tin foil hat. That&#39;s fucking genius in my opinion. I may have different values then some, but fuck, he should get some kind of trophy. I imagine even some of those tards were checking the online radiation detection centers days later. This kind of thing is all part of the human experience, it&#39;s what makes life interesting. He was a modern day Orson Welles. I don&#39;t hate him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what he&#39;s saying. But evidence can be linked together: He was a drug-user. Certain drugs can cause paranoia in high use and be mentally addicting. Addicts tend to spend lots of money on drugs and their paranoid obsessions. </p>

<p>Is it not conceivable that these factors are linked?</p>

<p>Sounds to me like: Dude smoked a lot of pot, made him paranoid, so he got obsessed with reddit/this nuclear thing while going into debt for more drugs. His frequency in postings in that time period suggests he was unemployed. He wasn&#39;t sleeping, by his own admission, which severely fucks up your decision-making abilities. He got busted for drugs, went to jail. Now, is trolling/delusional/just plain lying for karma or attention.</p>
