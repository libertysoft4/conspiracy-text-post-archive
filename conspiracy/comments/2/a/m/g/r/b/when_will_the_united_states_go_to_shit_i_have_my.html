        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I sit here, day by day, wondering why other people don&#39;t understand that we are all being fucked by the power that be. I am only 18 so I still haven&#39;t fully experienced anything, but being young gives me time to be able to make a change throughout my lifetime. Based on everything I&#39;ve read, the whole world is pretty fucked up and America will be on the wrong side of history. I understand that America is heavily medicated and indoctrinated so that many don&#39;t care about what doesn&#39;t effect their lives. The general populi sees what&#39;s going on around them, but they don&#39;t think about what impact it really has on their life. The United States has become a country where people will think that &quot;It will never happen to us.&quot; when shit happens everyday in this country to normal citizens. Police killing civilians, militarization, mass surveillance, high imprisonment rates, gun confiscation, false flag attacks, etc,. I have been slowly preparing myself for what I can only see as a full authoritarian takeover by learning what I can about what is going on, getting into shape, and learning how to fight. What can we do to change the mindset of the people, or is it too late?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) if/when it fully breaks down, knowing how to fight won&#39;t really help. It&#39;s not like ONE soldier will walk up to you and say &quot;Surrender or put up your dukes and let&#39;s fist fight!&quot;. It will be 25 soldiers with machine guns and armored vehicles saying &quot;come with us or we open fire&quot;.  In the event of total break down people will form militias and what not (I suppose in this sense being in shape and good at fighting might help, but only minimally.). </p>

<p>2) there likely isn&#39;t going to be a single moment where everything crashes, but rather a very slow but steady decline. The # of poor will increase and lifespans will decrease (without access to good food and medicine people will start dying younger and younger).</p>

<p>3) In the end most of the world will live in poverty and squalor while 1% live like kings.  We&#39;ll simply become like China was 15 years ago (although perhaps even worse because at least they grow their own food, whereas we&#39;ll be eating GMO shit). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I use to think this also, but I no longer do. I do think there will be a crash. In fact, if you ask me the crash from 2008 never ended. </p>

<p>Sure, the stock market is going up, but at a societal level things are just as bad now as they were then. </p>

<p>that&#39;s the rub, they&#39;ve &quot;fixed&quot; all the systems that are suppose to tell you how things are going ... stock market, unemployment figures, people&#39;s net worth, wages, food costs, gas costs, etc. ... and they&#39;ve made it such that as society falls apart all the &quot;numbers&quot; say that things are getting better and better. </p>

<p>So they&#39;ll keep doing this. The point where the system blows up could be 30 years away. </p>

<p>It&#39;s very difficult to tell when a ponzi scheme will blow up... and what is going on right now is pretty much identical to any generic ponzi scheme. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps. But if they wanted it that bad they could have ushered it in 2008 (the economy had basically been in a recession since 2001... which only the housing bubble masking how bad things already were). All they had to do was implement austerity in the US ... massive depression, world-wide banking failures, entitlements (food stamps, welfare) would have been cut drastically, etc... everything they needed to &quot;take over&quot;. </p>

<p>Taking over the planet is extremely complicated thing to do quickly. However, taking over the top of the food chain, now that can be done fairly quickly (and already has been done). Then it&#39;s merely a slow progression of allowing society to crumble and bit by bit take control over it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of like Greece... first you load it up with debt, then you crash it, then you buy all its assets for pennies on the dollar. That&#39;s what they are doing worldwide... but it takes a LONG time to actually take ownership of everything. You have to wait for people to go broke and liquidate their assets to survive. </p>

<p>Three reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They used 2008 as the trigger event to start sucking up all the remaining resources. That was &quot;last call&quot; so to speak for the ruling elites.</p></li>
<li><p>You don&#39;t understand how these guys think. Everything is about symbology and ritual. Things can only be done at certain times and certain dates. The date they usher in the final collapse is a date that will have significant meaning to them regarding astrology/astronomy/numerology.</p></li>
<li><p>They needed time to finish building their spying infrastructure. Most of the cameras and NSA spying has come about since 2008. Prior to that, I hardly ever saw cameras on public streets. (Maybe on public transit? Or banks?) But, now they&#39;re everywhere. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>You can write the history books, if you stay alive long enough! ;) In all honesty, people are remembered for doing what they had to do in the face of adversity, not thinking &quot;I&#39;m going to be a hero today!&quot; That thinking fills up holes in the ground very quickly. Analyzing the tactics of our supposed &quot;enemies&quot; in asymmetric combat theaters is a very good starting point for studying tactics to defend against an occupying force. </p>
