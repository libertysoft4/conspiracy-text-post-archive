        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I asked one question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a professional broadcast engineer, one thing I have always wondered is how the first moon landing was televised live. What equipment did you use to transmit the video and audio back to earth? What power source was used to facilitate the TV transmission?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I also replied to a couple of comments with a link to Buzz punching Bart Sibrel in the face, as well as an assertion that it might not actually be Buzz Aldrin doing the AMA. A minute or so later, I was suddenly unable to connect to reddit with my web browser. I was still able to ping reddit.com, my wife was able to access reddit with my account from a different IP, and I was able to connect just fine using a proxy service.</p>

<p>About 20 minutes later, I was suddenly able to get back on reddit. The strange thing is that I was able to ping reddit.com the entire time that I was receiving denial of service on my web browser. To me this says the web servers were specifically denying http service to my IP address.</p>

<p>This has never happened to me in all of my time using reddit, and it just happened to be while I was in the midst of speaking my mind in this high profile AMA session.</p>

<p>Coincidence or censorship?</p>

<p>Edit: After receiving a link to wikipedia, I looked into what it had to say about the subject of the lunar TV transmission. While they provided plenty of technical specifications such as the radio band and modulation techniques, I have seen nothing to address where the ELECTRICAL POWER came from to push out this transmission. Has anybody else found and information on this subject?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A 500 khz signal uses however much power you need to achieve the desired decibel level, or db. In radio transmission, there is this thing called the noise floor. This is how much &quot;noise&quot; or interference the antenna is receiving on the frequency you are receiving on. In both digital and analog (would have been analog in the 1960&#39;s) you need to overcome this noise floor by a certain amount in order for the information carried in the transmission to be decipherable on the receiving end. You could generate a 500 khz signal with a 9 volt battery as the power source if you so desired, but it wouldn&#39;t give you a very strong db output. In this case the signal would probably be indecipherable after a very short distance.</p>

<p>Satellite uplinks require significant electrical power in order to be received properly by the satellite. This is a much shorter distance than the distance from the moon to the earth. Another thing I have not seen any information on is what type of radio antenna was used to transmit this signal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, with my understanding of video transmission technology, I don&#39;t believe that it would be possible to initiate a wireless video transmission without access to a power grid or some other substantial power source. The claims that the lunar module had strictly battery power as the available power source says to me that they would have had to use all of their available electrical resources just to facilitate this transmission, if that would even be enough. </p>

<p>In addition to the electrical requirements, with 1960&#39;s technology I believe they would have needed an engineer dedicated to the video transmission in order to pull this off. Who acted as this broadcast engineer? The fact that the press was only allowed to capture the video from a projection screen instead of being given a genuine video feed is another indication that this was a large scale act of trickery.</p>

<p>I think the live broadcast of this event may be the Achilles heel of the moon landing story, and possibly why I was temporarily cut off after asking the question. People just don&#39;t understand how video transmission technology works, which is why this question has not been asked before.</p>

In my opinion if you are going to conspire to fool people there should be a reason besides uplifting the morale of a nation during the cold war era. Any thoughts on what reason anyone would have to fake the moon landing? </p>

<p>Edit: For the sake of argument lets say it was entirely staged. What negative result came about because of it to make it even matter?</p>
