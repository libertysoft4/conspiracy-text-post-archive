    <div class="md"><p>Hey guys, just for the sake of integrity here in this sub, I think we have and infiltrator from <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> here in this sub.</p>

<p><a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway</a> is a moderator of both this sub and <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> and will probably try to remove and censor this post, he&#39;s a user known to try to push his political agendas and was personally chastised by Glenn Greenwald due to his attempts to censor reddit.</p>

<p>Just a PSA.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/2adtxr/another_one_bites_the_dust_ubipolarsexperiment/ciu4s8k">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/2adtxr/another_one_bites_the_dust_ubipolarsexperiment/ciu4s8k</a> He&#39;s also recruiting help at <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> to moderate and censor this subreddit.</strong></p>

<p><strong>SECOND EDIT</strong>: I was shadow-banned... <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway</a> decided that reporting me and accusing me of vote manipulation would be a better course of action for censoring the truth than simply removing my comment or this post, since those would be too obvious. </p>

<p>For the sake of reference, I was shadow-banned when my post was sitting at <strong>EIGHT</strong> points, at the time of this edit it has 47; I think that can speak to the importance and integrity of what I&#39;m saying.</p>

<p>It should also worry all of you <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users that one of your own moderator&#39;s who might I remind you is a regular user of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and a moderator of <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, the subreddit this post itself is related too, directly for the censorship by moderators. </p>

<p>Now the thing I&#39;d honestly be worried about at this point, is that you have a moderator who is willing to conspire with admins to shadow ban users who have dissenting and questioning opinions in a subreddit that it supposed to be the main place for the people of reddit to come together and question the world around them, if that isn&#39;t backwards then I suppose I don&#39;t know what is.</p>

<p>Also, as to the accusations of this account being an alt of some type, I provide you, since you can&#39;t look at my userpage anymore due to my shadow banning, </p>

<p>A. My karma break down <a href="http://i.imgur.com/COzzsjD.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/COzzsjD.jpg</a> Which if you&#39;ll notice, over 80% of all my karma comes from sports subreddits, along with hip-hop heads, all of my karma in <a href="/r/JusticePorn">/r/JusticePorn</a> came from one comment and of course <a href="/r/srd">/r/srd</a>, where all of my post karma comes from two posts, neither of them having to do <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and all my comment karma coming from jokes. Now, does this look like the alt account of some drama harbinger, jewish monster who&#39;s full intentions are always to destroy <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> ?</p>

<p>Also, who would actively use an alternate account for <a href="http://i.imgur.com/mln62SO.jpg">606</a> for 606 days to throw it away in one comment? </p>

<p>Clearly, not everything adds up quite the way <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway</a> would like to frame it.</p>

<p>It could be that Redditors who seem to be supporting Redditors or contradicting them independently are on the same team. </p>

<p>Example: one user could post a shill post one way, and a buddy could try either support the shill post or use reverse psychology in a way that gets people to disagree with or agree with the original shill post, or have some thought that seems unrelated to the shill post. Or, simply to try to create mistrust and discredit Reddit. </p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty misleading.  What <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway</a> said was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you see any doxxing in the sub please report it to the modmail so we can nuke the comment, ban the user, and report to admins. Thanks.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t surprising at all.  You are a moderator at <a href="/r/edping">/r/edping</a> along with <a href="/u/redping">/u/redping</a> and <a href="/u/bipolarbear0">/u/bipolarbear0</a>.</p>

<p>Accusing <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway</a> of conspiring with admins is a bit strange, given that the admins really dislike him.  What it appears happened is <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway</a> messaged the admins to alert them to what looked like vote brigading in this thread, by you:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/NMfFUoC.png">http://i.imgur.com/NMfFUoC.png</a></p>

<p>As such, everything you&#39;ve said is highly suspect by virtue of it coming from you.</p>

<p>1) This post is not going anywhere.</p>

<p>2) I&#39;ll see what I can do in terms of the removal which sparked this post.</p>

<p>3) Greenwald did not personally chastise me, although he did make a silly claim about worldnews.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Mr. Greenwald had bothered to look into the issue at hand he&#39;d realize he made a broad generalization which did not accurately reflect the current state of affairs on the subreddit. Many people even pointed out to him that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/search?q=site%3Afirstlook.org&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on">a plethora of firstlook articles can be found quite highly upvoted on wn</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/search?q=Glenn+Greenwald&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;t=all">Even a cursory search of Mr. Greenwald&#39;s name on wn reveals a substainal amount of articles.</a></p>

<p>While I obviously agree with Mr. Greenwald <a href="http://i.imgur.com/zhn07RX.png">that there is rampant attempts at censorship of NSA content</a> on reddit, he was off the mark with his criticisms yesterday and perhaps should have looked into the issue a bit more. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>4) I was a moderator here before I became a moderator at worldnews, and I only joined the latter in the interest of transparency.</p>

<p>5) You are aware that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/21vc3e/introducing_a_flair_system_for_posts_which_report/">I implemented the flair system for tracking removed submissions in other subs</a>?</p>

<p>What specifically do you get out of moderating so many subs?</p>

<p>I can&#39;t see how anyone could hold down a job and moderate the amount of subs you (and certain others) do.</p>

<p>People should only be allowed moderate one sub, and if that sub achieves a certain popularity the community should have some input into the moderation policy of that sub. That goes double for the default subs.</p>

<p>There is a limit to how many defaults someone can mod. That limit is three from what I understand. Honestly I would not want to mod any more subs than I do now (and I don&#39;t know how some others mod so many); clearing the modqueue here and on worldnews alone can take hours. I spent about two hours last night clearing 60 days of backlog in the modqueue of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and did not even get close to finishing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahaha!</p>

<p>Of course, that&#39;s funny, but it&#39;s also an insidious problem. If everyone who disagrees with you is a shill (in your mind) then the word becomes even more dark and foreboding. The reality is that <em>everyone has their own agenda</em> and I&#39;m no different. I hang out in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because I&#39;ve always been inclined to the big, realistic conspiracy theories, but these days I&#39;m also here because I&#39;m a Freemason, and we get a lot of automatic hate around here. Sometimes I like to jump in and try to clear the air.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a &quot;shill&quot; but I am an interested party. I do have an &quot;agenda&quot; of sorts: to tell my side of the truth as I see it, which is, of course, most of our agenda.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for the laugh, and sorry for going all serious in the response. Just had to get that off my chest.</p>

My understanding is that at most of the lower levels, the Freemasons seem pretty benign (though of course historically quite influential), but that when you get to the 32nd degree it gets very dark very quickly, since presumably by then you&#39;ve been vetted to determine whether you&#39;ll go along with the program once you&#39;re aware of what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>Forget segregation, send them all back to Africa. Imagine the utopia if the negro suddenly vanished from North America.</p>

<p>And people think poverty and lack of education causes blacks to act this way. It&#39;s generic, the negro is a savage beast. People need to wake up and realize race is not a social construct. Niggers are gonna nig, no matter the social status.</p>

<p>Typical nigger. Nobody knows what happened before he started shooting the video. He posts this to YouTube claiming &quot;muh raccaysium&quot; . Go back to Africa blacks if you don&#39;t feel welcome.</p>

<p>I wrote the mods, mod said, and I quote</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to reapprove that one for now. It&#39;s not any more contentious than the ones around it. My guess is someone reported it, and a mod removed it on a sweep through the queue without noticing the rest.</p>

<p>I think the comment that made them lose their shit was the counting comment I made that was later reapproved</p>

<p>Number of children killings</p>

<p>Hamas        0</p>

<p>Zionists       23 and counting</p>

<p>I have no idea why people would even give them mention, they&#39;re no better than a tabloid at this point.  Don&#39;t frequent them, don&#39;t give them attention and educate people with at least half a brain why they shouldn&#39;t either - there are so many better sources out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So when will there be a new site to post stuff on for different subjects? Hopefully if anything comes after reddit it won&#39;t sell out like this place is doing. This place is kind of like youtube and early social networking, at first it was by the people and for the people. Then a bunch of rich people seen that everyone is liking something and then they buy it out. It&#39;s total shit. If I had the know how to make a really popular site like this I wouldn&#39;t sell it out to anyone. </p>

<p>This is the first time in human history that we can all communicate with each other from anywhere in the globe randomly in the blink of an eye. We seem to take it for granted all of the time, but to me it seems like the first time the world has something to bring itself together since biblical times. But even though we have this wonderful communication tool to finally show us that we are all just people we don&#39;t give a damn.</p>
