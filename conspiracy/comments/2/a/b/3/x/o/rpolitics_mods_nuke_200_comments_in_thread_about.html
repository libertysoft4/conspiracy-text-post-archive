    <div class="md"><p>You are one of the most controversial power users on Reddit you put yourself in that position no one else did.  If you can&#39;t handle that than stop for a while you seem very worked up over things kids, trolls, and assholes said about you on the internet.</p>

<p>At this point more eyes have been on you than some of the most controversial famous people in real life. You think they really care what someone says behind their back on the internet? you think they go on internet forums and refute every bad thing anyone has ever said about them? that&#39;s how people go off the deep end sometimes you just have to let shit go. Get yourself some help, take things a little less seriously and who gives a fuck what people think about you. Don&#39;t let them affect you that&#39;s all they wanted to do in the first place.</p>

<p>PS. This is coming from someone who downvoted a controversial comment you made on his 4 year old account and got shadowbanned for vote brigading even though i have never participated in one or have ever followed a link and voted.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been over this, I used the place as a qualifier that there have been offers to &quot;purchase accounts&quot;, the subreddits existence should be enough to bolster that point. It really doesn&#39;t matter if the place has been used.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a mystery. Not exactly &quot;thousands upon thousands of comments in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> dehumanizing him&quot; but he&#39;s more than a little bit the drama queen. </p>

<p>Seems he&#39;s totally derailed, actually. I love how factual statements you said about him modding a sub are considered by him to be hate-speech and lies demonizing him somehow. Such the victim. How dare you objectively calmly state something true about him. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>afidak [+5] 14 points 2 hours ago (?|?)</p>

<p>censorship is alive and well on Reddit. I&#39;m not even sure if most of the top mods on the main default subs are the original creators of the accounts anymore. <em>There have been posts in the past about people offering money to buy accounts, i wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some of those mods got bought out.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Canadian_POG [-1] 6 points 2 hours ago (?|?)</p>

<p>There is <a href="/r/AltExchange">/r/AltExchange</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please describe your alt accounts posting history in as much detail as prudent and what you are seeking in return. Passwords are only to be swapped via PM. This is at your own risk, as once a password is sent, the other user could renege and just steal your account. You have been warned. Please delete the thread once a trade has been made.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably the most suspicious subreddit I&#39;ve ever seen.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<p>Here is where you jumped in:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>BipolarBear013 -8 points 2 hours ago (?|?)</p>

<p>You mean the subreddit created almost two years ago with literally no posts, comments, or mod actions whatsoever? <strong><em>Are you fucking retarded?</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<p>I made no extra claims other than that the place exists, and that I find it suspicious. I didn&#39;t even implicate you until another user pointed out you mod it. <em>-Nothing was said that wasn&#39;t backed up with the evidence...</em></p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want people pointing out the things you do that are obviously shady as fuck, then don&#39;t do them. And if my words were truly worthless, would you be here, contesting to their worth?</p>

<p><em>literally nothing to do with anything.</em> literally doesn&#39;t even make any sense, and is such a shitty deflection that I literally laugh out loud every time I hear it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why I suck?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You &quot;suck&quot; for making it about you. You suck because you&#39;re making it easy to see <em>why</em> people have a problem with you, especially since I&#39;ve already explained why I said what I did, but you keep making it about you, almost as if you <em>are</em> guilty.</p>

<p>Do you think <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> likes being stalked and harassed by r/conspiratard, collectively, 24/7? </p>

<p>Do you think the majority here even give a flying fuck about that? About you? ...You probably do, and you&#39;d likely be wrong.</p>

<p>Do you think that if you don&#39;t want people posting links to a supposedly dead subreddit you moderate, that you could always just not moderate the place? Or not care when people do since everything&#39;s gonna be ok?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think that what I&#39;ve said and how I&#39;ve acted tonight is as a result of nothing at all, as opposed to a result of two years of constant stalking, witch hunting, harassment, defamation, and death threats? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say nothing, that&#39;d be a whole lotta something from nothing. Something definitely went wrong. I wager you&#39;re just venting on me because you think I&#39;m dumb. When realistically you have nothing on me and out yourself as nothing but a hostile bully.</p>

<p>Do you think that maybe it&#39;s not all defamation, and that maybe you welcome all of it unto yourself as a participant?</p>

<p>Do you think you&#39;ve been given some rather sound advice tonight, and walking away might be the best solution to your stress, because your reputation is sullied due to your actions?</p>

<p>As opposed to worrying about getting murdered by a truck driver from <a href="/r/motorcycles">/r/motorcycles</a>? You sound a little more unhinged than most of the people I&#39;ve spoken with in this subreddit, again, I recommend taking a break.</p>

<p>Despite your little conspiracy theory, I literally mentioned it because it proved his point, such a concept exists on Reddit, I&#39;m fairly certain you&#39;re seeing patterns where* there are none.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even arguing, I&#39;m literally explaining to you why you are wrong. You <em>know</em> I have not violated any rules, nor was I the one to bring you up originally.</p>

<p>Mmhmm, well, do you think it at all possible that maybe it&#39;s a strange subreddit, and the person who brought it up, in fact <em>wasn&#39;t</em> doing so in spite of you? That maybe people just think it&#39;s an odd subreddit to exist? And the fact that you moderate it is simply coincidental, yet also a conflict of interest in hindsight?</p>

<p>You seem to have the need to continue lobbing ad hominems, care to explain why you think this helps your position?</p>
