<p>Israel is the aggressor and the Palestinians are defending themselves.

<p>If you do not support Israel and their actions, then it seems that you&#39;ve been caught up in their propaganda. </p>

<p>How was I misleading? In my mind this whole thing began with the murder of the Israeli teenagers. All of the the rockets and missiles seemed to come out of this event, at least as far as I have been able to tell by media reports.</p>

<p>So you don&#39;t think Hamas fired rockets first or you think that they are justified in shooting unguided rockets into Israel? Either choice isn&#39;t that appealing.</p>

<p>You could have talked about who shot first and you could have mentioned how Israel agreed to a ceasefire, but they were met with 30 rockets being shot into their country. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I can agree that Hamas fired rockets after a ceasefire, but I also think its justified because they are being systematically destroyed by Israel. Also it could very be an ad hominem if the basis of what you claimed compromised my integrity was irrelevant, which is still up for discussion.</p>

<p>Want to know what I really think? I think Hamas is the best friend of Israel. They send in these ineffective, unguided missiles that bring nearly no detriment to Israel but they give Israel an excuse to unleash their modern weaponry on what remains of the Palestinians.</p>

<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB123275572295011847">http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB123275572295011847</a></p>

<p>I think, ultimately, this whole conflict is a big farce and someone is playing both sides. It has always been a typical strategy of big players in the world: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbO0f9uaWZE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbO0f9uaWZE</a>.
It would make a lot of sense for Israel to create Hamas and equip them with just enough weaponry to create ruckus, but never actually impact the conflict.</p>

<p>But I still want to side with the Palestinians because they are the oppressed peoples, not the Zionists. The Palestinians were occupied and Israel is the aggressor, and now Israel has created and equipped Hamas to continue the creation of one state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know Hamas are the guys really to blame for this shit right? Yeah Israel and Palestine both make mistakes, but the whole reason for the fighting flaring up is because of Hamas&#39;s useless rocket attacks. It&#39;s not a coincidence that every time the sensible people in Israel and Palestine start peace talks Hamas starts another rocket attack. Then the old warhawks in Israel take over and start bombing everything they can find (and since Hamas won&#39;t stop shooting the old assholes will never stop returning fire). Either Hamas has to stop shooting for long enough for sensible people to start talking, the Iron Dome has to be perfected (because once it&#39;s 100% no one in Israel will be able to support bombing Gaza), or the most realistic option is everyone has to wait until the old warhawks die and younger more sensible people can take over Israel. The younger smarter politicians can make a real deal with Palestine (not sure how they deal with Hamas&#39;s attacks, maybe popular support in Palestine turns against them eventually and Palestine works together with Israel to take them down). </p>

<p>It&#39;s just like in the US, we&#39;re never going to have peace while all the old fucks who don&#39;t understand the people they &quot;represent&quot; are in power. We need a president / congress that understands the horrors of war and won&#39;t send young men to their deaths so easily. </p>

Not only Palestinians but Jews and other people have paid the price for standing up against Zionists. Have a looksie. </p>

Why is it okay for Palestinians to blindly shoot over 1200 missiles at the civilians of Israel but one misfire from Israel&#39;s end causes an outrage? Israel takes the utmost precautions when attacking Hamas hideouts (which happen to be in schools, mosques, and other locations where they can leverage Israel&#39;s humanitarian ideals by using innocent civilians as shields) to assure the citizens know to evacuate the area. It&#39;s not even a comparison, the second the Palestinians lay down their weapons Israel will as well, the same cannot be said in the reversed scenario.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a false comparison, let&#39;s compare number of rockets and missiles fired. Over the last month Hamas have fired approximately 2000 rockets toward Israeli civilian centers with warheads ranging from 70kg to 200kg filled with ball bearings and nails while the IDF have conducted aprox 1500 precision strikes.</p>

<p>Over the last decades Israel not only developed and deployed the only missile shield in the world but also required every new home and building under construction to be built with steel reinforced concrete room to act as a shelter. Hamas, OTOH, have commandeered all the concrete and steel to build bunkers for its rocket arsenal, bunkers for its political and military leadership and to add insulte to injury, have stashed launch pads, rockets, C3 equipment and other military equipment INSIDE civilian houses.</p>

<p>I&#39;m terribly sorry that you and your like find it reprehensible that Israel have spent the time and effort to defend its citizens and so the death toll in Israel is so low. While Hamas use civilians as human shields in order to protect its military assets and court as many civilian deaths just to make israel look bad.</p>

<p>As for this specific inccident, every death is a tragedy, and the death of a child is the biggest tragedy of them all. Unlike Hamas (who in case of dead children will rejoice and hand out candies on the streets) the IDF is conducting a throughout investigation in order to understand what went wrong, and that&#39;s for two main reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The most important one is that Israel fear for its soldiers souls as much as it fears for their lives, your average IDF soldier is a conscript who at 18 have to give 3 years to protect his home, Israel have no intention to turn out generation after generation of brutalized soldiers.</p></li>
<li><p>As this very thread show, it doesn&#39;t look good. Forget for a moment the fact the the Israeli public will find it hard to stomach wholesale killing of civilians, I know most of you don&#39;t give a crap about this since in your eyes every Israeli start the morning with a glass of a freshly dead Palestinain kid, in the international court of public opinion the Palestinians are the masters of using incidents like this to blacken Israel face.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So over the last 15 years, the IDF have develop new weapons, methods and C3 procedures specificly targeted to avoid civilian casualties in places like Gaza (where more often than not, there is a Palestinian familiy living right above a launch pad or rocket storage) and the results speak for themselves, out of ~1500 strikes in Gaza there are only ~200 deaths (and let&#39;s forget the fact that about 100 of those are armed terrorist) no other military force in the world have done something like that, no western force let alone an Arab one (just take a look at Syria and Iraq).</p>

<p>As for Gaza being an open prison, that is simply cause and effect. I won&#39;t go into wether Gaza truly is an open prison, that an issue for an entire other debat, what I will say is this: up until around 2006 between 40%-60% of gazan worked inside of Israel, in construction, agriculture, manufacturing and the like once Hamas have taken possession of Gaza by a coup from the, Israel have not allowed gazan to enter its territory for fear of suicide bombers. This inability to smuggle suicide bombers to strike vital military targets such as cafés, bus stops, and schools to name a few lead to the current rocket threat and ended us where we are today.</p>

<p>The quickest way for civilians in Gaza to be same again is for Hamas to stop its attacks on Israel, but considering Hamas charter this isn&#39;t going to happen.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a false comparison because it&#39;s lopsided. Maybe Israel Zionists should stop killing and then that number wouldn&#39;t look so gruesome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The destruction of the Palestinian attacks? Israel built a state of the art missile defense system to protect it citizens (that is why you are not seeing any destruction), the Palestinians use their citizens to protect their missiles, that&#39;s the route of the issue. The argument isn&#39;t where there are more casualties, that is not an apples to apples comparison. When one culture values death as much as the other values life it is hard to find a solution. It is difficult for reasonable person to understand the mindset of an extremist, that is not the way most of the world thinks. Many outsiders sympathize with the Palestinians, because they appear to be the &quot;underdog&quot;, if the world truly understood what their true intentions were and the amount of  propaganda that goes into their campaign sympathizers would have a much different view (also doesn&#39;t help that there are 1.6 billion Muslims in the world to spread the propaganda)</p>

Seems it&#39;s usually anti-Israeli people are the ones posting all the angry raciest shit that most people don&#39;t want to have to look at (any Jewish person has to avoid the comments like the plague to avoid all the blatant racism people post there). If people would actually just post facts and have adult conversations without going &quot;ISRAEL IS THE DEVIL THEY ARE COMMITTING A HOLOCAUST&quot; or &quot;Fuck the zionist cunts who murder children!!&quot; or &quot;All arabs must die&quot;. Although I&#39;ve actually never seen any anti arab hate, it&#39;s always people using Israel&#39;s shitty foreign policy to justify their extreme anti-jewish racism (and going on Bipolarbears little &quot;experiment&quot; I&#39;m guessing a lot of the sensless racism and hate is coming from the people here). </p>

<p>Israel is committing war crimes and calling it self defense, right now, as we speak. Censoring the promotion of awareness is not far off from complicity.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re wondering why most of the comments are anti-israel, maybe take a few minutes and use the internet to explore the majority of the worlds opinion on the issue. After that you may want to check on who is actually supporting israel, that doesn&#39;t have a vested military interest in the region... that last one is a short list.</p>

Lots of people think what&#39;s happening in Gaza is terrible and unjust and would like to follow what&#39;s happening as it occurs.

If so it&#39;s a weak tactic hastily created to try to prevent people from seeing reality.</p>

<p>Who decides what&#39;s a low effort article if not Reddit users who upvote or downvote a post? This is how Reddit more or less works with some unwanted exceptions that skew numbers.  It should be the same on <a href="/r/Worldnews">/r/Worldnews</a> when you see huge numbers of posts about what&#39;s happening to the people in Gaza.  You can downvote them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably a coincidence. The mods were probably writing the hide button once they realized their &quot;experiments&quot; were failing, or at the very least temporary. This silences those that don&#39;t want to see it (These are the ones that would ignore the links anyway people, so no loss here). I&#39;m fairly certain their button has nothing to do with the acts of some assholes who want to blow up children.</p>

<p>&quot;Roger Roger - we have the button on r/worldnews up and ready. Destroy palestinian children at your leisure, we have reddit on lockdown now.&quot;</p>

<p>Give me a break.</p>

<p>Your original comment, which was misleading. Your subsequent comments did not. I was just correcting your misleading nature. For being someone in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> you&#39;d think you&#39;d have more integrity or maybe it&#39;s the exact opposite. </p>

Other than that rule you just had to put up with it.  There was no option to hide any posts.</p>
