All of the greed we see, all the war, the misery,the hardship, the unfairness, the deaths all of it is just about money.  Nothing else, just an imaginary, unreal thing.  Money is worthless, carries absolutely no spiritual meaning, nothing, just a human invention, yet that&#39;s what they&#39;re after.</p>

<p>All these eyes of Horus and skull and bones things are just club membership things so that rich people can identify other rich people, get together and chat about how to get more money.</p>

<p>I really wish there was an occult force behind it all, an illuminati group or even a huge Jewish conspiracy.  It&#39;d make it seem as though it had a point or it was striving for something.  But, it&#39;s only about money, how fucking sad is that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a network of occult forces at work--human ignorance is a spell cast on us which most of us willingly cast on ourselves, greed is a demon hive. Money is an amoral and often violent phantom, but a living one, a fact for most people. I think <a href="http://politicalvelcraft.org/2012/06/03/in-the-year-2000-there-were-seven-countries-without-a-rothschild-owned-central-bank-they-were-afghanistan-iraq-sudan-libya-cuba-north-korea-and-iran/">Rothschild banking</a> qualifies as illuminati though. </p>

<p>If there aren&#39;t evil wizards (of culture) intentionally keeping us imprisoned with necromancy(TV, pop culture sex and fap worship to keep people docile and grasping at the height of desire-impermanence loops, fluoridated water) and potions(SSRIs, alcohol, junk food) then we have a lot less of a reason to play this game. I guess it depends how you want to define things. </p>

<p>edit: Also I emphatically disagree that it is about money. Money is a tool for power and a representation of resources. Money is just a popular way for people to chase their greed and to use for power seeking, itself based on fear and ignorance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When did I ever say I was afraid of it? When I say &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot;, I only include myself because I haven&#39;t completely extracted myself from the system yet and am still forced to participate in some ways. In no way am I personally &quot;afraid&quot;, but I have very high hopes for humans which won&#39;t be realized any time soon if current trends.</p>

<p>By &quot;power&quot; I mean the ability of some sociopaths at the top of govt, financial, military, energy domains who have convinced or bullied us into buying what they&#39;re selling, so to speak. We live their agenda, not ours. That is power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on your definition of power.  Rise slightly above it and you&#39;ll see there is no power in money.  Sure a rich man could pay someone to kill you, but you could pick up a gun and shoot him, that makes you the more powerful.  The only thing money brings you is a nicer facade to surround yourself with and hide from the real world.  A car is a car and a house is a house.  If you just learn something simple like meditation then even if you were thrown into solitary confinement for years on end you&#39;d enjoy your stay.  Go higher and you&#39;ll even welcome death itself. Which is the most powerful?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not as simple as you present it. There is some guiding hand behind the deliberate and sustained attack on Western civilization that we&#39;ve seen unfold over the past few decades. Just because the owner of that hand can&#39;t easily be identified doesn&#39;t mean there is no hand.</p>

<p>Is it an individual? No, I don&#39;t believe so. Is it a cabal or some secret fraternity? No, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that either.</p>

<p>Is it the Jews? Well, the Jews are the officers in the army of hatred that is trying to destroy the West. But officers still need to receive marching orders from some central planner.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that the motivating thrust and the overall guidance of the war against the West has its origins in some hidden source -- maybe it&#39;s some collective group mind, or maybe it&#39;s a mind or set of minds that is non-human. For want of a better word, maybe the origin of the war against Western culture and Western values is demonic. David Icke may not be as far off the mark as people think.</p>

<p>Wherever the guiding and motivating impulse comes from, Zionist, leftist Jews are making it a reality in our world. They are translating the malicious intention into actual harm, and so bear a large part of the responsibility for it.</p>

<p>The answer that shouldve been presented after this question is an unequivocal <strong><em>NO</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Its not the Jews any more than it is the Blacks or the Chinese ir the Germans or the Whites. The group of people you are refering to are called Zionists. It would be unfair to establish a connection amongst ALL jews just because most (<em>not all</em>) zionists happen to be jews. But, not all, not even close to all, jews are zionist.</p>

<p>So lets be clear, its not the jews. Its the zionists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And yet, the guiding hand is money, they are steered by money and only money.  Wars are perpetuated because of arms sales, iPhones are updated each year because they can sell them, drugs are released with horrific side effects so they can sell you more drugs to combat the side effects.  Banks lend you and others money so they can make money.  It is all only about money.</p>

<p>There is no real cabal, sure there are people who think they&#39;re part of a cabal,but in truth their power will die once their corporation fails.  Which it will.  In your lifetime you will see the demise of Facebook, Google and possibly even Apple and Microsoft.  They will die and their CEOs will fade with it.  It&#39;s one big circus act with everyone chasing a fiction.  The one theme that will remain,that must remain is that money has value.  Yet it&#39;s the biggest lie ever foisted upon any creature that has ever existed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the biggest thing humans need to learn is the true history of our beginnings and all the societies  that have risen and fallen. Most history has been destroyed I think purposefully so the idea of money can be perpetuated. Most grow up in the wave that is society now around them but few try to understand the world around them for what nature and life is. I myself am trying to build my own path but there is so much unknown about the history of everything, I dont think ill ever feel I understand enough. Being human I think is one of the biggest problems we face in modern day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I keep saying.  They have no power!  None!  Turn off your TV set, switch off the radio, cut yourself off from the internet, take a few days off work, go into the wilderness, light your campfire, wait just a few hours.....now ask yourself, where is their power?  </p>

<p>The only power they have is the power to foist more lies on you.  Learn meditation and if they throw you in a FEMA camp or solitary confinement you&#39;ll be glad of it and will reach spiritual realms you can only dream of.  They can kill you, but see death as life&#39;s reward and they&#39;re doing you a favor.  They have no fucking power - YOU have power.  They are merely peddling lies, trying to deceive you into thinking they have power.  </p>

<p>They&#39;re all completely and utterly insane by any definition of the word.  They&#39;re all leaping around murdering people to get hold of a mythical fairy dust called money.

<p>Are you serious? All signs, all roads, point to a deeply spiritual, occult group of highly organized, highly intelligent beings. This group goes by many names, but the name that they call themselves is Lucifer. </p>

<p>Make no mistake, the only reason this incarnate experience exists is entirely for spiritual reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you believe in spiritual realms and the like take a read of every religious text, every ancient story, even fairy tales that have been passed down from generation to generation.  They ALL tell you one thing!  Evil is nothing but lies - it will reward you with nothing but lies.  Money is NOT power, nowhere near it.  All money does in reality is allow you to throw up a nicer facade to hide from the real world.   </p>

<p>You want the real world?  Buy a tent and spend a few weeks in the wilderness.  All our buildings, roads, homes, cars, technology, artworks, sculptures etc is a giant smokescreen to hide from reality.  There is no reality there, we really are living in the matrix.  So, these people want power over a huge pile of bullshit?  Let them have it.   You think Bill Gates has power?  Yet most of us could give him the smacking of his life in a physical fight - where&#39;s his power as he&#39;s having the shit kicked out of him?  Where?  It doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>You go down a path of evil and you will be rewarded with nothing but lies, heaped on a pile of bullshit.  The person with one grain of good in them can destroy you.  Just as one day if we keep fighting to destroy the world it will simply destroy us in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>And yet, yes there are bloodlines and yes there are secret societies but they have been taken over by the clueless, who&#39;s only interest is money.  The old bloodlines have gone, look at the Brit Royal Family, I&#39;m serious in my next statement - there are Pakistani&#39;s living  on the streets who have a more legitimate claim to the throne of England than the Windsors.  They have zero true royal connection at all - they too are in it for the money!  Those old bloodlines who do still exist are found just having normal jobs, living in normal homes and most are unaware that they have such a line.  If you take a look into your own surname you may find you hold such a bloodline.</p>

<p>The current use of symbolism is misuse of symbolism.  The people that allow it to be used in such a way are misusing the symbols and even if they do have any power, that power will be negated into nothing.  Again, it is just a bunch of clueless amateurs pretending they wield some kind of spiritual power, when they have none whatsoever.  It&#39;s all about the money!</p>

<p>I would like to know from what you base this opinion. The occult is the only thing that binds the elite together. Their joint efforts perpetuate the conspiracy and if anyone were to break the line, the whole charade would finally collapse. So far, none have done so. Why? Not because of money, they have money. What keeps them in check is an underlying understanding that what they do, as lucifer, is necessary for human spiritual evolution. The royal families are not in control. Bill gates is not in control. The elite bloodlines whose names are unknown are in control and just as spiritual as ever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with some things you are saying. That being said, I think it would be wrong and severely dangerous not to think there is a coordinated attempt to consolidate world power into one single entity (NWO). Money is a means to power, but power is the ultimate high. Some of these people have all the money in the world. When you have that kind of money, you don&#39;t really sit around thinking how can I get more money. No, they think about the greatest high. How can I gain power/ control over fellow humans. Some of these people amassed huge sums of money, because they are sociopaths/psychopaths. Their end goal is power/ control, it&#39;s not all about the money, as they may have you think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is your definition of power?  You are more powerful than all of them put together.  You have no blood on your hands, even if you do, it&#39;ll be less then they have.  So, you are the better person and one grain of good will defeat a mountain of evil - all those old fairy tales, all the religious texts, everything tells you this is true.  If one thing alone can be learnt from religions it is that no invented power can defeat nature, even Christ in the gnostic gospels when asked what the truth of it all was said &#39;look at nature&#39;.  The real power is right outside your front door.  They don&#39;t possess any real power, they&#39;re just chasing a fiction.  </p>

<p>The only problem we all have is that we too have to buy into that lie and go out to work to earn the fairy dust.  So much so that we devote almost our entire time in the pursuit of fairy dust.  Now, isn&#39;t it time to think up a new concept?  Money obviously doesn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>Take some time out and really think about it.  We are just monkeys, that&#39;s all we are.  We are social animals, and like all monkeys are easily tricked, and boy have we been tricked big time!

    <div class="md"><p>I believe in almost nothing. One thing I do believe, though, is that the bad will always triumph over the good.  The reason religious tradition has it the other way around is because people want to believe that evil will not win.  But it will because bad people are doing their bad things while other people are trying to enjoy life.  I like you, though...you&#39;re an optimist.</p>

<p>It&#39;s about stability for resource infrastructure use and development. Money is just one tool used to make to the profane labor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Call it what you want-- TPTB, the Illuminati, the Freemasons, Skull amd Bones, just normal humans with insatiable greed-- their title is not important.</p>

<p>What IS important is the fact that those with most of the wealth (and subsequently most of the power and influence in this world) work together behind the scenes to further their affluence at the expense of the rest of the populations wellbeing.</p>

<p>To what ends? For which agenda? All that is currently speculation. All we can know for sure is that all the evidence supports a collusion of the most endowed to profit from keeping the rest impoverished.</p>

<p>But call them whatever you want. It doesnt change the fact that this is a thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct to a large degree.</p>

<p>The upper tier members who control the world actions and affairs of men wish to complete the Alchemical Great Work via the economy.</p>

<p>Once the Work is completed it will be end game. Event Horizon. The point of no return.</p>
