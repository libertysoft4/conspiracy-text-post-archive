        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In light of Sy Hersh&#39;s claim that the raid on Osama bin Laden in 2011 is &quot;one big lie,&quot; here&#39;s an overview of evidence in support of an alternative narrative: bin Laden died in December 2001 in Tora Bora from a lung complication as a result of kidney failure starting at least since mid-2000. </p>

<p>All sources are from the mainstream media, many of which have since been &quot;scrubbed&quot; from the internet.</p>

<p>2000 to September 2001: Reports Emerge of bin Laden Dying From Kidney Disease</p>

<p>In March 2000 the Chicago Tribune reports that an Afghan witness and &quot;Western intelligence official&quot; say bin Laden is suffering from severe kidney and liver failure. Link: <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-03-25/news/0003250085_1_laden-bin-religious-militia">http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-03-25/news/0003250085_1_laden-bin-religious-militia</a></p>

<p>This story was also picked up by CBS News in 2000, who outright lead with the title that &quot;Bin Laden Reported to be Dying&quot; from &quot;kidney disease.&quot; </p>

<p>In July 2001, the South Asia Analysis Group reports: &quot;Bin Laden, who suffers from renal deficiency, has been periodically undergoing dialysis in a Peshawar military hospital with the knowledge and approval of the Inter-Services Intelligence, (ISI) if not of Gen.Pervez Musharraf himself.&quot; Link: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011007021426/http://www.saag.org/papers3/paper266.html">http://web.archive.org/web/20011007021426/http://www.saag.org/papers3/paper266.html</a></p>

<p>September to November 2001: bin Laden is Trapped in Afghanistan, Unable to Receive Kidney Treatments</p>

<p>In September 2001, PBS&#39; Frontline interviews the former general counsel for the CIA, mentioning reports from 1998 that the DEA found out Osama bin Laden was undergoing kidney dialysis with a doctor in Peshwar. They mention further that the DEA wanted to poison bin Laden through his dialysis machine, but the CIA allegedy rejected this due to the ban on assassinations. </p>

In November 2001, The Guardian is reporting that French intelligence officials say bin Laden was flown to Dubai for kidney treatment in July of 2001, where he also met with several CIA agents and the head of Saudi intelligence. This story is also picked up by several French newspapers. Link: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/01/afghanistan.terrorism">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/01/afghanistan.terrorism</a>
In his first interview since 9/11, in November 2001 bin Laden talks to a Pakistani newspaper and claims that his &quot;kidneys are all right&quot; and denies visiting a hospital in Dubai the previous year (note that he may have visited one in Pakistan). In the same interview he also asserts, clearly lying, that he has &quot;nuclear weapons.&quot; Link: <a href="http://dawn.com/news/5647/osama-claims-he-has-nukes-if-us-uses-n-arms-it-will-get-same-response/2">http://dawn.com/news/5647/osama-claims-he-has-nukes-if-us-uses-n-arms-it-will-get-same-response/2</a></p>

<p>December 2001: bin Laden is Dead, Buried in Afghanistan
In December of 2001, the New York Times reports on &quot;high-level murmurings that bin Laden is dead.&quot; Link: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/26/international/asia/26LADE.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/26/international/asia/26LADE.html</a>
That same day,citing a Taliban source, Fox News reports that bin Laden has died due to an &quot;untreated lung complication&quot; from kidney disease. About 30 &quot;close associates&quot; reportedly attended bin Laden&#39;s funeral in the Tora Bora region of Afghanistan. A source concludes that the U.S. government and other forces are in a &quot;mad search operation&quot; but will never be able to locate the now-dead bin Laden, buried in an unmarked location. Link: <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2001/12/26/report-bin-laden-already-dead/">http://www.foxnews.com/story/2001/12/26/report-bin-laden-already-dead/</a></p>

<p>Late December 2001 to March 2002: bin Laden&#39;s &quot;Death Video&quot; is Released
In late December of 2001, after reports of bin Laden&#39;s funeral, a new video appears of a gaunt, sickly Osama bin Laden. The London Telegraph reports, verbatim: &quot;The recording was dismissed by the Bush administration yesterday as sick propaganda possibly designed to mask the fact the al-Qa&#39;eda leader was already dead.&quot; One aid further concludes that the video was created earlier in the event bin Laden is dead, who by December of 2001 was so heavily surrounded he would have been unable to escape to obtain kidney dialysis. Link: <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/1366508/US-casts-doubt-on-bin-Ladens-latest-message.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/1366508/US-casts-doubt-on-bin-Ladens-latest-message.html</a>
At this time CBS news also runs a story on bin Laden receiving kidney disease treatments in Pakistan the week before 9/11. Link:Osama bin Laden Near Death in 2002 (from Dan Rather CBS); US Government bin Laden LIE
In January of 2002, The Guardian reports that the president of Pakistan speculates that bin Laden is now dead of untreated kidney disease based on video and photographs of a gaunt-looking bin Laden. Link: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jan/19/afghanistan.oliverburkeman">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jan/19/afghanistan.oliverburkeman</a>
In January of 2002, based on his analysis of video and photographs of bin Laden from December 2001, CNN&#39;s Dr. Sanjay Gupta says that bin Laden seems to be having renal failure. He notes kidney dialysis is expensive, and suggests bin Laden would need help in obtaining medical treatment. Link: <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2002/HEALTH/01/21/gupta.otsc/">http://edition.cnn.com/2002/HEALTH/01/21/gupta.otsc/</a>
In March 2002, the BBC reports on an interview with bin Laden&#39;s wife, who speaks of bin Laden in the past tense, notes his failing kidney and frequent use of pills and other medicines. She says she has not seen her husband since September 2001, but holds out hope that he is still alive: &quot;I feel deep inside me that he is still alive.&quot; She also notes that bin Laden&#39;s wish was to die in Afghanistan and nowhere else: &quot;He never spoke to me about his intention to leave Afghanistan and always wished to die there. He told me once that if he ever left Afghanistan, it would be to meet his Creator.&quot; She also says that bin Laden &quot;always suffered from kidney and stomach pains and that he &quot;told me once that he was going to Pakistan for treatment.&quot; Link: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1871182.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1871182.stm</a>
In March and April of 2002, U.S. officials downplay the threat of bin Laden, with Rumsfeld even saying the bin Laden threat has been &quot;neutralized.&quot; Even Bush, called out for rarely mentioning bin Laden in 2002, admits: &quot;We haven&#39;t heard from him [bin Laden] in a long time... I don&#39;t know where he is. I really just don&#39;t spend that much time on him, to be honest with you.&quot; Link: Bush: Truly not concerned about bin Laden (short version)
In May 2002, ABC News reports on a new spliced-together tape from unknown time periods in which bin Laden appears &quot;about the same&quot; (that is, sickly-looking) as in the tape from December 2011. ABC News also says they have &quot;learned intelligence reports indicate bin Laden had received a kidney transplant in Pakistan,&quot; but do not know when.

<p>July 2002: FBI Chief Says bin Laden is Most Likely Dead; Nothing from bin Laden Since December 2001
In July 2002, the BBC reveals a bombshell: the FBI&#39;s counter-terrorism chief Dale Watson says bin Laden is &#39;&quot;probably dead.&quot; Conveniently, bin Laden&#39;s followers&#39; claim that bin Laden will &quot;not make more video statements until his group launches another attack on the United States.&quot; Link: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2135473.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2135473.stm</a>
In July 2002, CNN reports that bin Laden&#39;s close bodyguards were captured in February of 2002, but not bin Laden. The article also quotes mentions some high-level officials: &quot;Some high-level U.S. officials are already convinced by such evidence that bin Laden, who has not been seen or heard from in months, is dead.&quot; Link: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021204040117/http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/07/30/binladen.son/">http://web.archive.org/web/20021204040117/http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/07/30/binladen.son/</a>
In July 2002, Time Magazine reports that &quot;intelligence officials are not certain whether Osama bin Laden is alive or dead&quot; but that &quot;they have found a tantalizing document that suggests he was living at least as recently as the last days of December [of 2001].&quot; Link: <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1002840,00.html">http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1002840,00.html</a>
In July 2002, The New York Times runs another article on how Osama bin Laden is likely dead. The author notes how unusual it would be for bin Laden, known for his constant desire for media attention, would be silent for over half a year. Link: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/11/opinion/the-death-of-bin-ladenism.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/11/opinion/the-death-of-bin-ladenism.html</a></p>

<p>October 2002: Intelligence Officials Confirm bin Laden is Dead; bin Laden&#39;s Will is Released
Also in October 2002 the D.C.-based news service The World Tribune, citing Israeli intelligence sources, reports that the United States and Israel have concluded that bin Laden died in Afghanistan in December 2001. They note that additional bin Laden messages are &quot;probably fabrications,&quot; and that bin Laden&#39;s heir has been chosen. Link: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021205223313/http://216.26.163.62/2002/me_terrorism_10_16.html">http://web.archive.org/web/20021205223313/http://216.26.163.62/2002/me_terrorism_10_16.html</a>
The president of Afghanistan also concludes that bin Laden is probably dead: &quot;The more we don&#39;t hear of him, and the more time passes, there is the likelihood that he probably is either dead or seriously wounded somewhere.&quot; Link: <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/central/10/06/karzai.binladen/">http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/central/10/06/karzai.binladen/</a>
In October 2002 CNN reports that U.S. intelligence officials have obtained Osama bin Laden&#39;s will, which is dated December 14, 2001 (approximately the same date as has been reported bin Laden&#39;s funeral in Tora Bora by Fox News and other outlets). CNN also reports that there has been no evidence of bin Laden since December of 2001. Link: <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/10/26/binladen.will/">http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/10/26/binladen.will/</a></p>

<p>2002 Onwards: Efforts to Target bin Laden are Closed Down; bin Laden = &quot;Elvis&quot;
In 2004, the LA Times quotes Donald Rumsfeld (who mixes up Hussein with bin Laden) as admitting: &quot;We&#39;ve not seen him [bin Laden] on a video since 2001.&quot; Link: <a href="http://newsmine.org/content.php?ol=9-11/binladen/death/rumsfeld-says-no-clues-to-bin-laden-since-2001.txt">http://newsmine.org/content.php?ol=9-11/binladen/death/rumsfeld-says-no-clues-to-bin-laden-since-2001.txt</a>
In 2006 the New York Times reports the CIA had officially closed down the unit focused on capturing bin Laden the previous year. Link: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/04/washington/04intel.html?ex=1309665600&amp;en=3779ed9b98bb9d22&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/04/washington/04intel.html?ex=1309665600&amp;en=3779ed9b98bb9d22&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss</a>
In 2006, U.S. and Pakistani officials say they have not received any information about bin Laden in years: &quot;no tips from informants, no snippets from electronic intercepts, no points on any satellite image.&quot; The article rehashes the December 2001 video of bin Laden as the most recent evidence (other than a second-hand claim from 2003) of bin Laden&#39;s existence. Some commandos are now giving Osama bin Laden the codename &quot;Elvis.&quot; Link: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/09/AR2006090901105.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/09/AR2006090901105.html</a></p>

<p>The available reports overwhelmingly supports the view that bin Laden died of kidney failure in December of 2001. We have mainstream media reports from a variety of sources, and zero credible evidence since then, as admitted by top level offiicals. Even if you believe the official story, the evidence very strongly suggests some entity (either the CIA, Saudi Royal Family, the Pakistani government, or all the above) helped bin Laden survive long enough via medical treatments to be killed at a later point in time.
This very well could be the &quot;one big lie&quot; Seymour Hersh has mentioned in The Guardian recently.﻿</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s a real shame that it was such a fucking good movie. I was very disappointed after watching it to find out that it was bollocks. The torture scenes were hugely exagerated to make it seem like torture was a vital part of tracking down Bin Laden, basically to make it seem like less of a shitty thing to be doing. Also apparently the tactics used in that incredible final showdown weren&#39;t really accurate.</p>

<p>I suppose it&#39;s still possible to thoroughly enjoy the movie if viewed entirely as a piece of fiction though. Really well staged film.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I knew part of this story from other sources. Osama had a problem with his kidneys, which explains his sallow, almost yellow complexion. Years ago, the Saudi intelligence service donated two kidney dialysis machines to the Taliban. One was for the major hospital in Kabul, which is still in use. The other was for Osama’s personal use. Only, Osama’s kidney machine was rigged. Instead of curing him, it was slowly poisoning him. Osama figured out what was happening, and fled to Iran for medical care. The Saudis fired their intelligence chief for his failure to get rid of Osama. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me connect all year dots for ya:</p>

<p>US wants a false flag operation and hires their old mujahideen buddies to do it. For some reason they accept.</p>

<p>Then we get about 2000 people to participate in the effort to stage 9/11 successfully, enact the plan, and declare Al-Qaeda the culprits.</p>

<p>Now enemies to literally everybody, Al-Qaeda gets beat to hell after being invaded by the US and friends in their own home-land. </p>

<p>Through all of this no one spills the beans.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Osama died in 2001 but the rest of Al-Qaeda leadership decide to keep him as a figurehead for the organization anyway.</p>

<p>Now it present day, Al-Qaeda is on its last legs, and they still won&#39;t admit that 9/11 was nothing more than a hit ordered by the US government. Because money is worth seeing all their friends dead and their homelands turned into wastelands ruled over by their now-enemies. And it&#39;s been like this for 13 years.</p>

<p>Sorry, that&#39;s one conspiracy I can&#39;t buy.</p>

<p>Then America looks stupid for chasing a ghost and never leaning he was dead for over a decade, and we just killed some innocent man and our Navy Seals couldn&#39;t tell that it wasn&#39;t Osama. We just look ridiculous and AQ looks more powerful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, from this very thread:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2asd8y/proof_bin_laden_died_in_2001/ciym87b">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2asd8y/proof_bin_laden_died_in_2001/ciym87b</a></p>

<p>15 upvotes. And this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> where people are dedicated to finding the truth that is covered up by government/media lies, so when can I trust it and when can I not? It seems to wildly fluctuate based on whether or not it supports one&#39;s argument.</p>

<p>And seriously, why wouldn&#39;t Al-Qaeda speak up already? I can think of only one scenario where they wouldn&#39;t: AQ&#39;s leadership is making big money from the US gov still and they haven&#39;t told any of their foot soldiers the truth and are fine watching them die. The flaw with that, of course, is that we&#39;ve killed a LOT of AQ higher ups to the point that I think it&#39;s mostly new blood running the organization. </p>

<p>Why would they?  How is it to their advantage?  Surely it&#39;s much more advantageous to them to have this mythic figure, this criminal mastermind that the US couldn&#39;t ever catch?  Surely having Bin Laden &quot;still alive&quot; would take the heat off whoever was the actual boss?</p>

<p>The US looks ridiculous for chasing a dead man for over a decade, they just killed an innocent man, and AQ can now say they&#39;ve not lost any of their great masterminds because they&#39;d been living without him for years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that makes logical sense. However, what if Al Qaeda never actually existed and Osama was just an extremist who the government rated as the most wanted man and saying that he was part of an extremist group called &quot;Al Qaeda&quot;--which they made up?</p>

<p>Just to throw this out there, &quot;Al Qaeda&quot; means &quot;The Base&quot; in English.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a reasonable question, but why would it be to their advantage?  As long as he was alive, he was &quot;the man the US couldn&#39;t catch&quot; - his existence spread fear to Al Qaeda&#39;s enemies and must have been a huge fund raising feature.</p>

<p>Your answer is equivalent to, &quot;Believe what the government tells you whether or not they have any evidence.&quot;  I tend to be on the skeptical side of conspiracy theory and I get a lot of flak here for it, but in this case there is simply no evidence at all for the government&#39;s story, and I&#39;m not willing to take anyone&#39;s world on trust.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll link a news article when I&#39;m home from work, but there was a 25 minute black out during the raid so this photo was not of them actually watching anything go down. So not staged in the sense that it&#39;s completely fake, but staged to make it look like they are all watching/giving orders from some type of situation room when they had almost  no idea of what was happening during the time when they supposedly killed bin Laden. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A newspaper catering to ultra-Orthodox Jews in New York apologized on Monday for publishing a photograph of the White House Situation Room during the raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound that was digitally altered to make it seem as if Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and another female official had not been present.</p>

<p>And previously by the White House:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the White House acknowledged there that it had already altered the photograph before releasing it. A note in the Flickr caption explains that “a classified document seen in this photograph has been obscured.” (Incidentally, because of the blurring of that document, on the computer to Mrs. Clinton’s right, The Times, which has a policy against printing any altered images, initially hesitated to publish this image at all.)</p>

If they had released pictures, conspiracy theorists would simply say they were fake just like they did with any photographic/video evidence of 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure what claims you are referring to, but perhaps you have in mind that clip where she says that Omar Saeed Sheik murdered Osama bin Laden?</p>

<p>IMO, it is pretty obvious that she meant to say &quot;Omar Sheikh, the man who murdered <em>Daniel Pearl</em>&quot; (that being the only way the average member of a Western audience watching the show would
recognize the name &quot;Omar Saeed Sheikh&quot;, whether accurate or not).</p>

<p>It was a slip of the tongue.</p>

<p>She had, just two minutes earlier, mentioned Hamza bin Laden, so the &quot;bin Laden&quot; name was definitely on her mind. The interviewer seemed to agree that it was a slip of the tongue, as indicated by the fact that he
didn&#39;t bother to stop to ask for any details on what would have been a massively groundbreaking story, if the statement was intentional. </p>

<p>Benazir (someone I really respect, despite her flaws) also <em>repeatedly</em> referred to bin Laden as <em>alive</em> in the months leading up to that
interview (in August, September and October of 2007, the Frost interview was in November 2, 2007). But Omar Saeed Sheikh had been in prison since 2002, so it&#39;s hard to believe that she really thought he was
responsible for bin Laden&#39;s death..</p>

<p>Far more importantly, <em>she referred to bin Laden as alive AFTER the Frost interview</em> (e.g., in an interview on November 9, 2007, and another on November 13, 2007). </p>

<p>From my vantage point, this is yet another example of conspiracy advocates insisting that we should accept <em>one</em> claim as gospel truth, when it supports their viewpoint, while dismissing multiple other claims by the same person, before and after, that serve as evidence against their position. Why are they so prepared to accept <em>that</em> specific claim, and so eager to dismiss all of the others? There is a perfectly reasonable explanation for her anomalous statement, which, if intentional, was made with inexplicably <em>no</em> fanfare whatsoever. What is the similarly reasonable
explanation that explains <em>all</em> of her contradictory statements?</p>

<p>Bhutto faced at least two assassination attempts, including one in the months <em>before</em> the Frost interview. So I think it&#39;s bizarre for folks to assume that her death was the result of a reprisal assassination by the CIA, at least on the basis of the video I think you have in mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s also possible that the US realized much later that Osama died in 2001, and figured they had to stage his death because otherwise the country would be in an uproar. The US spent so much time and effort trying to catch this guy, and if this guy really died in 2001, all that time and effort seems like a waste and the US government would have a lot of explaining to do. Oh, and Obama would never have gotten re-elected. Remember how much they talked up &quot;We caught Osama!&quot; during his election?</p>

<p>Regardless, I do think that the release of Zero Dark Thirty&#39;s release time was carefully planned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there a theory as to the reason for covering up Bin Laden&#39;s death until many years later? Coalition forces remained in Afghanistan after the official story was published. That makes me think that they really did not need the hunt for OBL as an excuse to continue military ops. Then also, wouldn&#39;t the previous administration jump at the chance back in &#39;01 to take credit for &#39;disposing&#39; of the most wanted man in history? Seem Bush and Co. would have loved that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually very inclined to believe OBL did pass away in &#39;01, but what is the purpose of keeping it black until 2011? </p>

So most of these links are from the media, and the media is known for being government fed, so why in the hell would media facts be facts at all? Either way one of the deaths were staged (no shit). I find it hard to believe that he died in 2001 and in 2011 his death was staged, then again I find it hard that his death could have been staged in 2001 and he kept quiet all that time. What if both deaths were staged and here in a couple years the CIA says they capped the wrong guy because bin Laden just made another terorrist video and captured 15 American soldiers and 3 British journalist... crazy shit man... crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is how I see it, he either died back in 2001, which a lot of CIA have thought, or he was moved to Pakistan and his whereabouts were known.  I always thought it was interesting that the Government lied about his <a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2011/05/bin_ladens_fict.html">super evil mountain fortress</a>, which he would need if he had a dialysis machine.  But, as MSM tells us, he some how snuck out of Afghanistan and was hiding in Pakistan.  The question would be, how would he have gotten to that house with a dialysis machine?  I know it would probably been a lot easier if the US Government let Pakistan fly cargo planes in to Afghanistan and air lift foreign fighters (members of Al Qaeda and the Taliban) out months after 9/11.  <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3340165/ns/world_news-brave_new_world/t/airlift-evil/">But that would never happen right</a>? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunduz_airlift">Right</a>?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily, I personally think if he was still alive and was actually living in Pakistan, he was probably transported out through the air lift of evil.  The Government made up his mountain fortress for pure propaganda and to sensationalize the situation for the masses.  As for his assassination, the only evidence I have ever seen argued, was that his wife was there, which isn&#39;t enough evidence for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one thing that makes me take this seriously, besides the sources the OP lists above that your can feel free to check out yourself...is the fact bin laden had dialysis in 2000, and then supposedly lived for 11 more years?!</p>

<p>That would be an insane medical miracle! You do NOT get dialysis for kidney failure due to chronic disease and live 11 years. Doctors <em>might</em> tell you 3-5 years, for 90% of people in that situation they have 2-3 years. But nope, he must have had magic muslim-terrorist powers to live with kidney failure for over a fucking decade and our politicians have told us he just happened to be killed right before a presidential election. Yup, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s the truth...after all, our government has never lies and exists merely for peace and prosperity of its citizens, right fellow patriot??</p>

<p>News of Bin Laden&#39;s Death and Funeral 10 days ago</p>

<p>Islamabad - A prominent official in the Afghan Taliban movement announced yesterday the death of Osama bin Laden, the chief of Al-Qaeda organization, stating that bin Laden suffered serious complications in the lungs and died a natural and quiet death. The official, who asked to remain anonymous, stated to The Observer of Pakistan that he had himself attended the funeral of bin Laden and saw his face prior to burial in Tora Bora 10 days ago. He mentioned that 30 of Al-Qaeda fighters attended the burial as well as members of his family and some friends from the Taleban. In the farewell ceremony to his final rest guns were fired in the air. The official stated that it is difficult to pinpoint the burial location of bin Laden because according to the Wahhabi tradition no mark is left by the grave. He stressed that it is unlikely that the American forces would ever uncover any traces of bin Laden. </p>

<p>This circumstantial evidence, including the death of the Navy Seal team that was supposed to have killed him, the lack of photographs of the dead Bin Laden, [remember Saddam Hussain, he was in every paper] plus the very strange sea burial with no witnesses, would, if this was given in court give you an actual case. </p>

<p>And I am very allergic against the tinfoil insults. Tinfoil hats are used to ward off aliens or made up beams, nobody is talking about ridiculous shit like that. We are talking dodgy government behaviour, which, if you care to read up on history has been a staple occurrence that can be proven through actual records.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me connect all year dots for ya:</p>

<p>US wants a false flag operation and hires their old mujahideen buddies to do it. For some reason they accept.</p>

<p>Then we get about 2000 people to participate in the effort to stage 9/11 successfully, enact the plan, and declare Al-Qaeda the culprits.</p>

<p>Now enemies to literally everybody, Al-Qaeda gets beat to hell after being invaded by the US and friends in their own home-land. </p>

<p>Through all of this no one spills the beans.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Osama died in 2001 but the rest of Al-Qaeda leadership decide to keep him as a figurehead for the organization anyway.</p>

<p>Now it present day, Al-Qaeda is on its last legs, and they still won&#39;t admit that 9/11 was nothing more than a hit ordered by the US government. Because money is worth seeing all their friends dead and their homelands turned into wastelands ruled over by their now-enemies. And it&#39;s been like this for 13 years.</p>

<p>Sorry, that&#39;s one conspiracy I can&#39;t buy.</p>
