        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2ap1pv/documents_leaked_by_edward_snowden_reveal_gchq/cixq879">This was my comment thread.</a></p>

<p>Of course the little sneak had deleted all of his comments by the time I received the message. He was called out by another user in the thread about the new Snowden leak. I cannot find the original but it was something along the lines of:</p>

<p>&quot;Now you know who pays u/bipolarbear0&quot;</p>

<p>The bear showed up to respond. I confronted him because he was trying to play dumb with the other user, using classic denial tactics.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/N8W9n2M.png">I woke up this morning and saw this private message.</a></p>

<p>Interesting to note that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/analkidfucker">AnalKidFucker</a> has clearly made comments and submitted links, but has systematically deleted them all.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I just got another one from a user called [Treebog](<a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/treebog">www.reddit.com/user/treebog</a>).  <a href="http://i.imgur.com/UM0SbrB.png">Here is the screenshot.</a></p>

<p>They both sound ridiculous, almost like satire. But at the same time, why would they even do it? Its pathetic.</p>

<p>Also, I clicked on my comment thread link when I wasn&#39;t signed in, and it showed all my comments as deleted. WTF is that about?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2</strong>: I am sure I am opening some kind of pandora&#39;s box by even posting these. But I want to point out that none of these users are new.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/sfxJbUY.png">Another one</a></p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/G0uLWri.png">The last one I am going to post</a> so don&#39;t bother if you expect to see your message in the next edit.</p>

<p>With whom you are dealing with</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What outcry have you uttered about my person, you oafish brute? I shall cordially remind you that I was the best scholar in my law class in Oxford, and I have been involved in several frivolous tea parties and courtroom disputes, and I have over 300 boxes of Earl Gray. I am proficient in the Simian school of diplomacy and I am the top linguist in my book club. Know that you resemble nothing in my eyes save for yet another uncultured mind. I will hasten your undisputed expiritation of the world with grace and finesse. The thought that you can retreat after jesting of such matters over the internet is laughable. As of this moment, I am telephoning a mutual friend to negotiate a swift and sure rebuttal to your argument so I would implore you to prepare yourself for the upcoming verbal deluge. The deluge that will no doubt saturate your life with discomfort. You are well and truly wrong, my good sir. My abilities of travel are unmatched, and I can recite over 700 lines from Shakespeare, and that is just from Hamlet. The amount of knowledge that I have acrued is vast, and I shall use it to firmly state my authority on such matters, you rapscallion. Truly, I wished you had some semblance of knowledge on the matter you have brought up and it&#39;s repercussions. Alas, you did not, and now you will suffer a fate most dire, you plebian. I shall defecate concentrated dislike upon you and you shall struggle to survive in it&#39;s waters. Pistols at dawn, old boy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the in the name of the Queen did you just fucking say about me, you little chav? I&#39;ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the SAS, and I&#39;ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Ireland, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gentlemanly warfare and I&#39;m the top rooter tooter long range shooter in the entire UK armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this great planet, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, chap. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the world and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, banger. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You&#39;re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that&#39;s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Royal Marines and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little muppet. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little &quot;clever&quot; comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn&#39;t, you didn&#39;t, and now you&#39;re paying the price, you goddamn dolt. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You&#39;re fucking dead, mate.</p>
