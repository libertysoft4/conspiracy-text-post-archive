    <div class="md"><p>This is important.  There has already been evidence of officers turning off or otherwise tampering with body cameras that could have been used as evidence.</p>

<p>They need to enact policies whereby the camera is as necessary as the officer to the functioning of the duties.  If the camera is not in working order, then the officer is not in uniform.  It would be the equivalent of driving around in a squad car without functioning emergency lights.  The police officer cannot properly do his job without them.  Therefore when they are not funtioning, the officer is not in uniform, and thus is not properly representing the service and should thus be held accountable for any and all actions and complaints.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What doesn&#39;t add up?</p>

<p>Paragraph 1</p>

<p>I wrote that the claimed use of SWAT is for especially dangerous situations.</p>

<p>Here is the definition of SWAT <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAT"><em>&quot;Their duties include: confronting heavily armed criminals; performing hostage rescue and counter-terrorism operations; high risk arrests; and entering armored or barricaded buildings.&quot;</em></a></p>

<p>Paragraph 2 (A new paragraph can contain a new idea not dependent on the preceding paragraph)</p>

<p>I wrote <em>over 40,000</em> per year...<em>over 110 per day.</em> </p>

<p>110x365=40,150</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2013/08/swat-team-nation.html">Citation 1</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/overkill-rise-paramilitary-police-raids-america">Citation 2</a></p>

<p>Or do you just mean that it is absolutely incredible, that is to say completely unbelievable, that the police claim that there are more than 40,000 extremely dangerous raids necessary every year in the US? Your comment didn&#39;t give me much to go on.</p>

<p>Yeah sorry for the lack of clarity, that was my point exactly. There is no way there are that many situations that require a SWAT team if their claim is that SWAT is only deployed for &quot;especially dangerous&quot; situations.</p>

<p>When researching my reply I noticed in <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2013/08/swat-team-nation.html">Citation 1</a> that the article says one estimate is 80,000 per year! The most frequently appearing guesstimate seems to be 50,000.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good friend of mine is a police chief in a small town. He made cameras mandatory for his officers as soon as he took office and there have been no &quot;malfunctions&quot; to date. </p>

<p>Where it&#39;s been extremely useful is actually as part of an internal investigation of one of his employees who is, delicately put, a piece of shit. What the cameras are getting him is going to be used as evidence to fire this person in the near future... and hopefully save my friend from some local political backlash.</p>

<p>So, anecdotal I know, but here&#39;s an example of body cams being used to get a bad cop fired. I support their use absolutely, though they&#39;re only part of the equation. </p>

<p>Really the military-like structure of police depts isn&#39;t too far removed from the same military-like structure I&#39;ve encountered in training as a surgeon. </p>

<p>Surgery is &quot;softening&quot; in a lot of ways... and the cops have softened a bit, too, but really you can trace almost every shitty cop on the street back to shitty leadership and a culture where if you speak out or complain or try to change things you&#39;re either beaten into submission or fired for trumped-up reasons and never let back into &quot;the Club.&quot;</p>

<p>Hold the Chief of Police <em>truly</em> accountable for his/her officers&#39; fuck-ups. Add in things like body cameras and people on the street not scared to film the cops working. I really believe those things will lead to us having some more honest--or at least cowed into behaving honestly--cops in our towns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real hard thing about police filming and recording audio treads very closely to violating the 4th Amendment.  You could argue that you were being recorded by the police even if they&#39;re just conducting normal business.  Say you consent to a search when you visit a public event, all the police have camcorders, if they record audio while searching your bag then they would be violating the 4th.  Recording audio is the distinction in legality -- I don&#39;t really think the cameras would be that helpful unless they can record audio. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would rather have the camera looking into my bag to catch the pig sneaking something in.... or &quot;planting.&quot; The video would only be used by the courtroom... they wouldn&#39;t post them all over the internet....especially if private matters are involved. Wouldn&#39;t you rather have the viewer actually SEE the objects found in the bag instead of just taking the officers word on what was found?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;ONLY&quot; downside I can think of is cost and logistics... </p>

<p>So is it a central database for each department? Or each prescient? How long should records be kept? Every officer, every second while on duty? Thats A LOT of video.. Computer storage is cheap but i mean it still cost money. Furthermore what happens if it is broken then what is the recourse? Shit DOES break even if .5% breaks thats still more than a few officers across the US. Sooner or later one of those officers will be involved in something and it will just happen to be &quot;broke&quot;. THere are a lot of problems but it is clearly a net positive</p>
