        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First of all I apologize if any of this is already obvious to some people or common knowledge here.</p>

<p>It seems to me that almost every country on the planet is under the control of (and in debt to) the central banking elite, except for a few middle eastern countries (Which the west is currently desperate to invade), and North Korea. </p>

<p>We like to think that we are sovereign nations in the west, in control of our destiny - however we are seeing politicians more and more pushing for unpopular policy that benefits the USA, and the people who control it, rather than what will get them votes from the local populace (An inconceivable, and counterproductive thing to do in honest politics).  </p>

<p>These same politicians have suspicious ties which the USA and elite bankers, for example - John Key, the priminister of New Zealand worked for the US FED in New York, and even the opposition leader, David Cunliffe went to the Harvard School of Government and worked for the Boston consulting group. </p>

<p>And before them, Helen Clarke was in power, and after pushing through many pro globalization policies and then finishing her term, she was rewarded with the third most powerful position in the United nations. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the same for countries the west invades, or overthrows with revolution under the pretext of bringing &quot;Democracy&quot; to the people. Why it always a puppet government sympathetic to western goals that gets voted in under these new &quot;democracies&quot; ? </p>

<p>When every single politician you could vote for has blatant and obvious conflicts of interests, what is the point of voting? These people are obviously administrators for the elite, rather than the people actually in charge. It doesn&#39;t matter if they sell out their countrymen, because they get rewarded for it when they leave, or are voted out of office.  </p>

<p>It makes sense that world domination would be achieved by a secret group which cannot be overthrown or voted out, which takes over and controls countries through finance and influence, rather than military might. This is especially true when considering how against being controlled by other nations or foreigners most nations on this planet are. </p>

<p>This idea that the world is pretty much already controlled by a small group of people has some scary implications. Is the Russian/western tension at the moment just theater? Certainly both Russian and US corporations massively benefited from everything that&#39;s happened in Ukraine so far. (Billion dollar gas and oil deals on both sides)</p>

<p>Would be interested in what r/conspiracy thinks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/29w6a1/i_never_would_have_expected_this_to_happen_on/cipeu12">this post</a> should get you pretty decisively into the no camp.</p>

<p>Now, a more interesting question is &#39;what pathways exist, if any, to successful revolution in the US&#39;?</p>

<p>I&#39;d counsel you to consider what happened with the Occupy Wall Street movement.  This is a movement that had the potential to overthrow the existing power structure.  We can tell because the DHS/FBI instituted a nationwide crackdown; police beatings of protestors, mass arrests of activists, etc.  They were scared.</p>

<p>What went wrong?  Basically, they lacked a leader.</p>

<p>People probably severely underestimate what exactly would be required of a leader of a revolutionary movement.  Just consider the financial system.  This is an extraordinarily complex thing - very few people in the world grasp it, much less have any notion about how to rapidly seize control of it in a way that allows time for an orderly restructuring.</p>

<p>Imagine the consequences if some leader failed in this regard only.  Financial panic can result in hungry bellies across the country in a matter of days.  Chaos rather than reform.</p>

<p>Obviously this person has to have intellectual capability <em>FAR</em> in excess of this already high bar.  You need someone who can rebuild the economy, manage international relations, the ability to withstand an impulse by the oligarchy to assassinate them, and on and on.</p>

<ul>
<li>we&#39;re clearly limited to someone in the ~150+ IQ domain</li>
<li>probably has to be an American</li>
<li>requires extraordinary level of education outside the mainstream.  I&#39;d suggest they must have come of age with full blown internet and thus be no older than 30-35, but not significantly younger or they&#39;d likely lack the depth of knowledge required; this restricts us to maybe 5-10% of the population</li>
<li>needs some means of simply surviving opposition and staying out of jail.  This probably means (1) a relatively wealthy family so 1% restriction and (2) some sort of leverage, hard to estimate this one</li>
</ul>

<p>Just the 0.1% IQ restriction, 1% wealth restriction, and 5% age bracket restriction gets down to 1 in 2 million or ~150 eligible candidates for saving the country.  Do you know who they are?  What they believe?  If you care about the future of humanity, it might be worth trying to find them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with most of this, two things though, first occupy wallstreet held so long precisely because they had no leader in my opinion, this made it uncontrollable because they usually just buy leaders or compromise them... And the candidate might be many candidates (or at least not just one), and not necessarily from the US, seeing as the problem is almost worldwide. Some countries are miles ahead, even among the zionist controlled entities, it&#39;s not impossible the domino effect starts elsewhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would disagree that the occupy movement held on at all. Their aims were immediately obfuscated and their rhetoric marginalized on day one. The media also made quick work of labeling occupy as progressive and the liberty movement as conservative setting two synergistic movements against each other. The media made short work of reducing both movements into obscurity and radicalism</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I concur.  Occupy had vast sentimental support at the outset, but there were two camps created based on the red/blue paradigm because no one emerged as an articulate leader with policy proposals.  People&#39;s first question is basically going to be show me the goods, what is the difference.  Without a vision to switch over towards, you revert back to the same old same old.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The leader thing was such an msm concoction. Too many hero myths. Populism didn&#39;t require the personality cult. Occupy fizzled because of poor leadership,  sure, but also because they were successfully marginalized. There won&#39;t be a successful large scale movement like that until austerity, and at that point it will be ready to coopt. Don&#39;t rely on a single revolutionary movement- put your time and money into causes you believe in to help transform the world into the place you want to live. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How will fighting get us anywhere?
We arm ourselves and take to the streets they bring riot gear. We rise to their challenge and cause them enough trouble they can bring in heavy guns, armored vehicles, tanks, planes, missiles etc. We try and fight through the law and they change a definition here, bribe a judge there, create a public scandal to discredit you... If we want to beat them we need to make them redundant and we don&#39;t do it by fighting. That just gives them the excuse to escalate; emotions like anger are far too easily to manipulate people with.</p>

<p>JSploosh has it right, a mental revolution is what we want followed by structured action. Decentralize the system by creating community resource hubs. Grow food, make stuff, trade with others. With solar power on the rise, 3D printing commercializing fast we can crowd-fund these projects within our community to cut electricity, food and manufacturing prices down hugely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>perhaps it has succeeded up to a point; meaning &#39;total control&#39; hasn&#39;t been attained - yet, but that&#39;s the goal. i believe there has <em>always</em> been a &#39;group&#39; of rich elite that controlled leaders of the world, as well as the world currencies, the manipulation has been constant; with tv, social media (not to mention replacing natural foods with GMO foods, etc) and wars,</p>

<p>many believe the ultimate goal is to have NWO (new world order) a global government, but because the world is over populated, for now it would be difficult to manage,</p>

<p>but Bill Gates has been working on one way to solve <em>the problem</em>: a microchip form of birth control that can be injected,  <a href="http://humansarefree.com/2014/07/bill-gates-foundation-announces.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+HumansAreFree+%28Humans+Are+Free%29">http://humansarefree.com/2014/07/bill-gates-foundation-announces.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+HumansAreFree+%28Humans+Are+Free%29</a>,</p>

<p>yes, it&#39;s very scary, but people are aware or becoming aware of what&#39;s going on, i think humankind is reaching a new phase of evolution (and maybe this is why everything is being done to keep us passive) but it won&#39;t be easy for everybody, ignorance is bliss. the evil of the world is being revealed (finally) and good <em>always</em> overcomes. (there&#39;s more of us than them)</p>

<p>&quot;In the absence of a total breakdown or climactic event in the international system (arguably the financial crisis came close to such a point), the problem of redesign of global governance in the twenty-first century can hardly be negotiated in a Congress of Vienna or a Versailles Treaty, or a San Francisco Conference or new Bretton Woods Agreement. While the significance of current developments in the global governance system should not be underestimated, evolutionary change rather than revolutionary institutional redesign is, at this point, the order of the day&quot;</p>

<p>That pretty much spells it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look to the work of carrol Quigley the Rhodes/millner group has had control of the commonwealth of nations dating back to the early 1900&#39;s the website tradgedyandhope has many resources to explain the phenomenon. More alarming I think is the idea that Wiston Churchill and Buckminster Fuller, both intimately connected to the leadership of the angloamerican empire, often referred to a &quot;high cabal&quot; implying there was or is a group with greater influence manipulating them.</p>
