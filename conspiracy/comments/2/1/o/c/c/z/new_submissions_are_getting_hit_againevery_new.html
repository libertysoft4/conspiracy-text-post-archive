    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<p>I posted this story to <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/secrets-about-suspected-israeli-theft-of-us-weapons-grade-nuclear-material-declassified---irmep-252658041.html">Secrets about suspected Israeli theft of U.S. weapons-grade nuclear material declassified</a></p>

<p>Obviously, it doesn&#39;t get more appropriate that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for a submission like this. But check out the voting so far:</p>

<p>After 30 minutes, <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/21o9xs/secrets_about_suspected_israeli_theft_of_us/">the post to worldnews</a> has 19 upvotes to 7 downvotes. That&#39;s extremely respectable and a sign it will continue to do well.</p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/21o9z6/secrets_about_suspected_israeli_theft_of_us/">Now check out the same submission to conspiracy</a>: <em>6 downvotes</em> and <em>only 1</em> upvote after 30 minutes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but that&#39;s bullshit.</p>

<p>Another example from this morning:</p>

<p><a href="http://journal-neo.org/2014/03/28/us-moves-to-crush-internal-dissent/">US Moves to Crush Internal Dissent: The attorney disciplinary board in Illinois has suspended Chicago-based activist attorney Kenneth Ditkowsky’s license to practice law for four years, following a hearing where Ditkowsky’s right to speak out against corruption in the courts featured center-stage.</a></p>

<p>This time, I submitted to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Normally, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> loves to downvote &quot;conspiracy&quot; related material, but observe:</p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/21obqk/us_moves_to_crush_internal_dissent_the_attorney/">After 10 minutes</a>, the post has 4 upvotes and <em>zero</em> downvotes in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.</p>

<p>After the same amount of time, <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/21obs3/us_moves_to_crush_internal_dissent_the_attorney/">in conspiracy</a> it has 3 downvotes and <em>zero</em> upvotes.</p>

<p>Bullllllshit.</p>

<p>Edit: Annd my post to worldnews <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/21o9xs/secrets_about_suspected_israeli_theft_of_us/">was removed</a> after 100+ upvotes. </p>

<p>A bunch of comments were nuked too, damn I wonder what they said.</p>

I recall a while back for instance a mod called username_tokin I think he had issues with the sub and I recall he knew how to progran bots. Not casting any doubt on your observations as I know fron your posts you are a long established member.  This post or one from the mods should be stickied anyway. The early period of a submission is crucial it can be killed with just 10 downvotes .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is why. Cause no matter how many upvotes a post receives if its first one is a downvote then it will never reach front page. </p>

<p>If you are not subscribed to the sub then you never see anything from this place. So a miricle must happen for anything you post to hit front page.</p>

<p>Now you can argue it is lizard people or whatever. Or you can just admit that the trolls and fuckers in other subs just love to fuck with you in here. Which I am betting is more likely the answer. </p>

<p>It is just their way of amusement.  I am 99 percent sure they just sit at the computer staring into that crt monitor cause they dont have a job and still live at home with their college education under them feeling so superior.  All the while with no job, no relationship except the clan on games. Using some worthless Pentium 3 desktop they are renting from Aaron&#39;s that is filled with roaches. </p>

<p>Too lazy to get up from the screen so they can watch the bot they &quot;programmed&quot; so they piss into mt dew 8oz bottles cause their penis just fits in the hole. </p>

<p>Yeah that is what I think is happening. </p>

<p>......also I know I cant spell. But I have a cell phone I am typing on cause I have a job and dont get to sit at home bitching about things that only matter to myself.</p>

<p>Doubtful.  More than likely it is a government entity guiding some false skeptics.  Conspiracy theories have become mainstream.  It is no longer laughable to question the government, and this is a trend I am sure the government would like to halt or reverse.  This sub is ground zero for that on Reddit.  The notion that it is the work of some bored college kids is laughable when you think about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend not to be so in the mindset of this sub after the whole truckers strike thing. Was all hyped up it was this grand thing and cops were mistreating citizens.</p>

<p>None of that happened I was there and saw it. Plus the so called convoy was two trucks only two. People in this sub were posting random pics and making this sub look as bad as the ones they always fight against. </p>

<p>The posts were not from new accounts either. It just changed my entire view of everything in here. Now I am not saying shady shit dont happen. But I really dont think the powers that be with 67 of the richest people have more wealth then 3.3 billion others woukd even give two fucks about reddit or the small demographic this site represents as a whole. </p>

<p>Dont be paranoid man fuck it. We all came to he party too late. Educate your children, nieces, nephews, kid next door about the shit going on. Kids are like sponges man. They want to learn. But for us ....now lol we fucked ourself with high-speed internet. Fast cars and reality tv. </p>

<p>There is NOTHING we can do in our lifetime to make a differance. Here is why.</p>

<p>Most the population in developed countries dont give a damn. They say they do but when you say great we have a meeting once a month and organize 2 times a year.</p>

<p>You will get excuses of oh I had to work and kids were sick. Life happened and you being an organizer and wanting to accept your position of somewhat importance will take the answers they give you.</p>

<p>Well distraction always wins. Dont organize I say it dont work here. Cops and other agencies will use that for fear tactics. They have mraps and tanks. You got a cell phone connected to a network they control. Fuck it become a weapon against it all and do as I said. And things will maybe be better for your grand children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How on earth can you interpret this post as forcing anyone to care about anything?</p>

<p>The point is, and I suppose I&#39;ll spell it out <em>again</em>, that legitimate conspiratorial submissions are being immediately downvoted several times in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, within seconds, yet the same posts are upvoted, and <em>not</em> downvoted, when submitted to the main subs like <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>, and <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.</p>

<p>In the past, the opposite would usually be the case. However, because of a dramatic influx of bots and trolls as of late, the new submissions to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are seriously targeted, so to counteract that, it helps if legitimate users in this sub frequent <a href="/r/conspiracy/new">/r/conspiracy/new</a> and upvote the good material.</p>

<p>Do you understand yet?</p>

<p>Now here you are claiming the holocaust is fake.  Maybe you think it is, doesn&#39;t really matter to me one way or the other.  I just wanted to point this out, so that when I see it pop up in conspiratard that this one comment makes the entire sub &quot;literally Hitler&quot;.

<p>Conspiratorial submissions are being downvoted immediately in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and the same posts are being similarly upvoted in the default subs. </p>

<p>This is extremely unusual, as the opposite is almost always the case. After years of posting on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, this only started happening a few months ago, and it&#39;s been getting more noticeable as of late.</p>

<p>What are you even doing in this sub?</p>

<p>Edit: I should clarify that last comment. I&#39;ve seen dozens of comments from this user in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and not once did I feel like it contributed anything positive to the discussion. This comment was no exception.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really care enough about you to keep track of every thread you participate in, I just mentioned that every time I&#39;ve seen you comment in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> I didn&#39;t feel like it added anything constructive.</p>

<p>Totes_Meta, and Oculus* both show at least a few threads a day on average made from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> linking here, meaning there are users there who browse here daily, (it is the overall intention of the sub after all.) therefore it is not completely unreasonable to say they could be accounting for at least <em>some</em> of the votes, and since there are plenty of seemingly pro-Israel users there, what is to stop them from hitting any Israel-related thread?</p>

<p>Any serious thread for that matter? I submit, that some of these individuals (paid and unpaid) have such an obsession with this sub, they would manipulate the votes in order to make the &#39;abysmal&#39; material have the most visibility, and the best of content to remain buried, so they can then use that argument to discredit this sub, just a personal theory of mine.</p>

<p>From what I can tell, you are pro-Monsanto, you don&#39;t believe 9/11 was an inside job, you make comments like <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/1vlgnl/lpt_go_fuck_yourself/cetmbsj">this</a> in r/circlejerk</p>

<p>Now here you are claiming the holocaust is fake.  Maybe you think it is, doesn&#39;t really matter to me one way or the other.  I just wanted to point this out, so that when I see it pop up in conspiratard that this one comment makes the entire sub &quot;literally Hitler&quot;.  New people here will have some perspective on what is happening.</p>
