        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello, I have a question.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried to explain most of the ideas discussed in this subreddit to many many people. Most of them think conspiracy theorists are people who just think too much or see the things they wanna see.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard people quote the Hanlon&#39;s razor plenty of times, for those who don&#39;t know, it&#39;s something like &quot;Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity&quot;.</p>

<p>In short, a lot of people don&#39;t think that the moral decay, destruction of liberties and privacy, endless distraction, corruption, etc, are part of a deliberate plan by some people, but actually it&#39;s just that being selfish and greedy cause all those problems.</p>

<p>Someone told me not long ago that &quot;I don&#39;t think the people in government really planned to do all those things, it&#39;s just that they found a way to make money off it, and they do it. It&#39;s not because some people planned it to make it happen.&quot;</p>

<p>And being honest, it kind of makes sense. Probable that&#39;s why a lot of people think conspiracy theorists are being morons.</p>

<p>So, is there a way to conclusively prove that these things happen as deliberate plan, instead of just the inevitable consequence of greed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a plan motivated by greed. I don&#39;t think it is dilberately evil in that people in positions of power are motivated by hate towards their fellow man. Its just the greed leads them to other like minded individuals. This leads to a snowballing effect of other greedy people working with like minded entitys untill you end up with the bilderburgs of the world using their collective powers for the greed of the people involved with no regards for the very real human consequences.</p>

<p>Its really to be expected though because if your business has billions upon billions of dollars invested in various international interests/economys its in your best interest to have some sort of influence in world affairs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is a mix of both. I have to quote House of Cards on this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Francis Underwood: Such a waste of talent. He chose money over power. In this town, a mistake nearly everyone makes. Money is the Mc-mansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart after 10 years. Power is the old stone building that stands for centuries. I cannot respect someone who doesn&#39;t see the difference. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I started a sub <a href="/r/UnitedWeStand">/r/UnitedWeStand</a> to help people not get caught up in between, and actually work with others to get out of it. Hopefully if it is just greed, then it will be easier to get out of than if the current system exists because of people&#39;s thirst for power. Either way it is disasterous for us and we are heading towards certain doom if we continue on in this manner. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is clearly a thought-terminating cliché. This means you can do whatever you want with malice, as long as you make sure it can be explained by stupidity. George Bush is a perfect example if you ask me. The 1% at the top have been in a war with the rest for a long, long time, but we are &#39;programmed&#39; to not notice, or even care. So our rights gets compromised and the global police state keeps growing, all in the name of security.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This memo was issued to the American Bankers Association, in 1891, detailing how the ABA could and would create a depression: 
&quot;On September 1st, 1894, we will not renew our loans under any consideration. On September 1st, we will demand our money. 
We will foreclose and become mortgagees in possession. We can take two-thirds of the farms west of the Mississippi, and thousands of them east of the Mississippi as well, at our own price...Then the farmers will become tenants as in England.&quot; </p>

<p>We are grateful to the Washington Post, the New York Times, Time magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected the promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world-government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the National autodetermination practiced in past centuries. -- David Rockefeller in an address to a Trilateral Commission meeting in June of 1991</p>

<p>At a meeting in Copenhagen June 10, 1931: Arnold Toynbee, &quot;Director of Studies&quot; at Chatham House, London, said: </p>

<p>&quot;It is just because we are really attacking the principle of local sovereignty that we keep on protesting our loyalty to it so loudly.
The harder we press our attack upon the idol, the more pains we take to keep its priests and devotees in a fool&#39;s paradise - lapped in a false sense of security which will inhibit them from taking up arms in their idol&#39;s defense.... ¬¬
We are at present working, discreetly with all our might, to wrest this mysterious political force called sovereignty out of the clutches of the local national states of the world. And all the time, we are denying with our lips what we are doing with our hands.&quot; </p>

<p>Nicholas Biddle (president of the 2nd bank of the US): Nothing but widespread suffering will produce any effect on Congress...Our only safe course is in pursuing a steady course of firm [monetary] restriction - and I have no doubt that such a course will ultimately lead to restoration of the currency and re-charter of the Bank. </p>

<p>Frank Vanderlip, president of Citibank and representative of the Rockefeller&#39;s confirmed the Jekyll Island event in a newspaper article: &quot;I was as secretive - indeed as furtive - as any conspirator...Discovery, we knew, simply must not happen, or else all our time and effort would be wasted. If it were to be exposed that our particular group had got together and written a banking bill, that bill would have no chance whatever of passage by Congress.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on the severity of the violation, and/or quantity of violations, which will vary depending on severity. I&#39;ve been using RES to tag users to keep track of repeat offenders, more or less. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve actually had to ban a few users (not many, but a few) solely because of over-the-top racism. One was <em>extremely</em> anti-semitic. Another was extremely islamaphobic. Another laden with the &#39;n word&#39; and so forth. Posts like that, are typically subject to an instant ban. </p>

<p>Most (nearly all) other violations will result in a warning. If someone is willing to avoid repeating their mistake, we&#39;re willing to let it go. As tempting as it may be at times, I try to avoid using the ban hammer whenever possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have similarly wondered if you got each of these individuals- the people who are purportedly a part of the evil cabal (you know, come up with a Master List as I&#39;ve seen of the &quot;Members of the Illuminati&quot;)- in a room alone with a magical truth serum, and asked them about their actions&#39; origins, and their motives and goals, I don&#39;t think they would answer with the words of the devil incarnate. It is hard to know what is there really, and what  we attribute meaning and patterns to bc of the way our brains work. (Seeing a constellation out of the stars, a massive expanse if tiny random dots from which OUR BRAINS pull a few to create a patterns) </p>

<p>It is difficult for me to imagine that there are these guys who want to watch the world burn, but they have grandkids; do they want their grandkids to end up in the Hell on earth they allegedly want to create? Maybe they are evil, and they do. </p>

<p><strong>OR</strong>....</p>

<p>Maybe in some unfathomable way, selfishness and greed within a human are these qualities that &quot;talk to each other&quot;, under the surface of a group, and subconsciously and thus unbeknownst to the individual, it looks like the people are in collusion with in another, but really it is the energy of evil just underneath the surface that begins to drive the actions of this group of people, and so as that happens, the people become puppets to the underlying evil to which their initial evil tendencies run amok gave birth. Evil energy becomes the puppetmaster and so it looks like there is a conspiracy. But there isn&#39;t. What is scarier than a conspiracy is that all of this is happening....random matching events and mass disasters of epic proportions that have synchronicities and coincidences unlike anything we&#39;ve seen before....and it was not planned. Not by the people carrying all the actions out. No one person is in charge. </p>

<p>That begs the question, then what is?</p>
