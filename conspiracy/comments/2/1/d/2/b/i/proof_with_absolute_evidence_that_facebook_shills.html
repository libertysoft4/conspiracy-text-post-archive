    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, those screenshots very clearly out at least one shill. And I hesitate to even use that word because I feel that it repels many otherwise openminded people from listening. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if these people are actually on Facebook&#39;s payroll, but this is real evidence that someone (whether a company or private citizens who just love FB enough to make several accounts supporting them) is trying to manipulate the public&#39;s opinion in a deceptive way.</p>

<p>What confuses me is people on other subreddits who deny this astroturfing or attempt to mischaracterize the users of this subreddit when they claim there are shills about.</p>

<hr/>

<p>EDIT: After seeing the explanation for the duplicate posts, it seems more certain that none of the users were marketing people. They&#39;re just very enthusiastic FB fans.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, many of you would acknowledge that it&#39;s no secret that companies will try to influence social media sites by pretending to be a regular user. Even people who mock this subreddit would declare it&#39;s an obvious and basic marketing strategy. I guess the difference between people here and there is that some of us tend to call out fouls excessively (and I hope we can admit when we were wrong) while others will never blow the whistle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I spend most of my life dealing with this info, so I&#39;ll give you my opinion: It is both. Even within the same illness, both exist. For example, depression rates are very high... some of that increase are simply people with situational sadness and other normal human issues who are falsely classified with &quot;MDD.&quot; On the other hand, some of that increase is legitimate. You can look to the increased suicide rates, self harm, etc. to substantiate this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re right, but there&#39;s also a connection to Big Pharma that should be taken into account. Those increased diagnoses rates for situational sadness and normal human issues that you mentioned leads to an increase in prescriptions being handed out. People who shouldn&#39;t be on pharmaceuticals are getting on them and it will fuck with your head. If you&#39;re a person who genuinely needs anti-depression pills or SSRI&#39;s I completely understand that, there are differences in brain chemistry that can be tweaked in a helpful way. But I think being on them when you really shouldn&#39;t be (I.e. do not have a chemical imbalance) is going to lead to higher rates of suicide, self harm, and whatnot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bingo! Serotonin is responsible for a great deal of your emotional processing and thoughts, it&#39;s not just a sad/happy juice that if you have more of you&#39;ll feel better. (Otherwise we&#39;d all be on MDMA all the time.)

    <div class="md"><p>This is true, but if you are taking any of these drugs you should be under close supervision, like most anything else in modern medicine if used incorrectly the can make the problem much worse in the long run. ex:not taking the full course of antibiotics. These chemicals can be invaluable, but only under the right circumstances. They aren&#39;t bunk but they also aren&#39;t a panacea. All I know is that they worked for me, but I would never recommend anyone taking them unless they really need them. I couldn&#39;t get a boner for 2 years, and my libido was shot. Still worth it.</p>

There were several very obvious shills posting, supporting each others&#39; posts, and crapping on dissenters. Two different people called them out for being shills, three counting me. Sometimes calling them out makes them immediately go away, especially when there&#39;s only one, rather than a brigade.</p>

<p>It is very hard toeing that line, I had lots of decent conspiracy conversations with one of my coworkers over the last year but then just a week ago I mentioned something about 9/11 and he says, light-heartedly, &quot;Oh you&#39;re one of those conspiracy guys aren&#39;t you?&quot; </p>

<p>I just laughed and nodded &quot;yup&quot; ha. I work with some cool people its not a corporate deal, but there&#39;s still a certain line you can&#39;t cross before everything you say can be dismissed without question.

    <div class="md"><p>edit: Just leaving this here for those who don&#39;t already know (not for you in particular).  :)</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shill">A shill, also called a plant or a stooge, is a person who publicly helps a person or organization without disclosing that they have a close relationship with the person or organization.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sockpuppet_%28Internet%29">A sockpuppet is an online identity used for purposes of deception. The term—a reference to the manipulation of a simple hand puppet made from a sock—originally referred to a false identity assumed by a member of an internet community who spoke to, or about, himself while pretending to be another person.[1] The term now includes other misleading uses of online identities, such as those created to praise, defend or support a person or organization,[2] or to circumvent a suspension or ban from a website. A significant difference between the use of a pseudonym[3] and the creation of a sockpuppet is that the sockpuppet poses as an independent third-party unaffiliated with the puppeteer. Many online communities attempt to block sockpuppets.</a></p>

<p>Yeah, those screenshots very clearly out at least one shill. And I hesitate to even use that word because I feel that it repels many otherwise openminded people from listening.</p>

<p>Is it really so hard to believe that shills are a real phenomenon? These so called open minded folk you speak of should open their eyes. It is in the interest of these businesses to manipulate social media and turn it to their advantage. The association of the word as a conspiracy theory retort or &quot;dirty word&quot; in effect is the result of those who do not wish to be exposed as such.. think about it.</p>

That being said  - it&#39;s unethical, it&#39;s manipulative, it&#39;s deceitful,  and it just goes to prove that organisations actually do this kind of thing,  Facebook,  Google,  fracking organizations, and even alphabet soup agencies - and they will lie about it..

<p>Maybe it is the wrong word.   I am referring to someone looking at your post history and finding absolutely anything to smear your character whether it is trends or personal information.  </p>

<p>It is just a shame that people cannot respect or discuss an alternative (less conspiracy) point of view formed on the same evidence</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i mean, that&#39;s only if you think the shilling profession (if &quot;professional&quot; shills even exist) is a strict one.</p>

<p>but shills are real, theres no doubt about that. look up the greenwald piece on it from february.</p>

<p>i agree with you that it could just be a troll, as many are, but the fact that facebook is heavily in bed with the nsa makes shilling for facebook a very likely event. </p>

<p>they might have loose &quot;regulation&quot; that allows for lazy shills. who knows? nsa workers have been caught doing inappropriate spying on their girlfriends, etc. </p>

<p>so an actual shill, already at the bottom of the totem pole? i wouldnt be so sure to say copypasta isnt in their little arsenal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The shitty shills are there to further hide the pro shills.</p>

<p>How can you root out a pro shill when everybody in the thread is focusing on the obvious shit shills?</p>

<p>I have a feeling the pro shills are VERY selective with what they post, how it&#39;s worded, and where it&#39;s posted.</p>

<p>They use the shit shills as a wall to hide behind.</p>

<p>Remember, I&#39;m not the smartest human in the room, so if I can think of a basic strategy like this to hide shills, you had better bet your ass that somebody who is smarter than me that is involved in this BUSINESS, damn well has thought of it ( and has probably already implimented it ).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Urgh! I want that job so much but I couldn&#39;t be that person. Unless, I do it and then make another account which could post immediately afterwards and debunk what I was paid to say. Maybe that would even things out.</p>

<p>So do you know what sort of company pays people to do this? Is it like a PR company?</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>They have made a statement, which is important to include. I&#39;m making no comment or judgement on this:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hahahaha, oh my god.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m the guy. The evil guy or whatever. Here&#39;s what really happened:</p>

<p>I commented in the <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> Oculus post. The top comment was like &quot;RIP Oculus&quot; or something. A bit later I see another rising post in /new, with the same kind of title. And what do you know? It has the same top comment! Wow!</p>

<p>So you know what I thought would be funny? To copy and paste the reply comments, just like that guy reposted the top comment. People will see that I posted all the comment replies to myself, recognize that they&#39;re the same as in that other thread, and have a laugh. Kind of caricaturing the karma whoring people will do in copying comments. At worst, it&#39;ll get a few downvotes, and at best people will have a laugh, right?</p>

<p>No. Not right. So hilariously not right.</p>

<p>Evidently doing this was proof that I&#39;m a...shill? (I&#39;m not sure what that means, but given all the hate mail I gather it&#39;s some kind of insult. I&#39;ll look it up if I start giving a fuck.) I&#39;m also a bot. And a Facebook employee. And an Oculus employee. And a bunch of other evil stuff.</p>

<p>Anyway, I made those comments, got a few people calling me a liar, and just figured they were a few vocal idiots. Went to class, came home and watched a few new rented DVDs with the girlfriend. I&#39;d say which ones, but maybe I&#39;m a movie rep too, praying on innocent Redditors! Lets just say one was a new animated film about a cold place, and the other was about being stuck in space. I login, and see a shit storm! Woohoo!</p>

<p>Death threats, probably a hundred personal insults, and so on. All of my recent comments have been downvoted (even the ones unrelated to the Oculus thing). Apparently there are way more paranoid Redditors than I thought.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll probably have to start a new Reddit account to avoid all the hate mail. And that&#39;s fine. I got rid of my last account because it contained much of my full name. I can&#39;t imagine what this kind of witch hunt would be like if people knew my name. ಠ_ಠ</p>

<p>It does kind of stink, though. I&#39;ve been gilded like 3-4 times on this account. Made quite a few top comments or front page posts that I thought contributed to the community. I&#39;ve had this puppy for a year! I even got into an argument with <a href="/u/shittywatercolour">/u/shittywatercolour</a>. And the guy who I copied/pasted comments from will probably the butt of this witch hunt as well. That honestly didn&#39;t even cross my mind when I reposted the comments. If you had told me reposting comments as replies to myself to poke fun at reposts would result in a witch hunt, I&#39;d call you insane. &gt;But it did, and (s)he is probably affected by it. And I&#39;m sorry. :(</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m going to report the people who threatened me and made personal insults, maybe post this comment elsewhere to spread what happened and then jump ship. To a new account. Fuck. This. haha</p>

<p>But outside of the main subreddits, reddit is still a good place to get exposure to primary sources. Skip over the obvious opinion shit that gets posted, and skip over the shill comments. Just keep digging at the sources until you get to the original primary source. Read that and do some critical thinking to make up your own mind. Don&#39;t let other people&#39;s interpretation heavily sway you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, not to get everybody&#39;s hopes up, but I&#39;m tentatively working on a p2p, manipulation-resistant reddit-like utility.  Assuming it ever nears completion, the features I have planned are intended to fix issues with corrupt moderation and shilling, among other things.  Since it&#39;s still very early in its development, what would you guys like to see in such a website/ utility/ whatever?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I plan to.</p>

<p>It has two clients, a native and a browser one.  The idea is that you can point your browser towards a known native client, and it will send you the browser client which is in essence just a website.  The browser client is what&#39;s used to view content on the utility, while the native client&#39;s only purpose is to host the network (mining).  From the browser client you will also be able to download a copy of the native client.</p>

<p>Or if that doesn&#39;t appeal to you, don&#39;t allow users to see their or other user&#39;s total amount of karma (encourages meme-spouting and other things that add nothing to discussion).</p>

<p>Either way this sounds amazing. </p>

<p>I am ready to ditch reddit (and 4chan for that matter), I just need a better alternative to come along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you mean 4chan-style anonyminity or Tor/ Freenet/ I2P style anonyminity?  If you mean anonymous posting, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a very good idea because it makes it extremely easy for shills to pose as multiple people.  If you mean anonyminity in terms of hiding your IP address from the network; I&#39;m trying to make it as anonymous as possible, but just from the nature of the tasks the network has to accomplish in this situation, I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s possible to achieve something Tor-tier.  It will still be much better than reddit and 4chan in terms of IP logging, though.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve gotten the suggestion to remove public karma a few times.  I may do it, though it&#39;s worth noting that the current plan calls for karma to operate much differently than it does on reddit.  Karma is going to be a sort of currency where upvotes cost one point and downvotes cost ten points, with the idea being that making votes expensive will discourage inane puns and memes and encourage more insightful discussion.  Users start with zero karma and it has to be earned either through recieving upvotes or &quot;mining&quot; karma.  Users can mine karma by running the native client on their computers and offering up a few gigabytes of disk space to the network.  For every hundred or so requests the client serves, that user will be awarded one karma.</p>

<p>Not that much easier than a reddit-like system where creating another account takes seconds. Hell, that is what this thread is about.</p>

<p>even if its organic it still creates a division of ideology which people clash on</p>

<p>Please. Understand. People bash this subreddit for claiming things are proof when they&#39;re literally not proof of evidence. It has been pointed out that there <em>are</em> other possibilities.</p>

<p>As of now, this submission is just fuel for the haters. </p>

<p>I think you might be viewing things here from a very skewed perspective.  There is no hive mind here, we are a group of individuals who all hold our own unique opinions.  </p>

<p>Every single time I see your statement expressed here by someone, or a statement that says about the same thing (oh the hive mind!) or (oh blame it on the joos!) I can&#39;t resist the urge to click your user profile and see conspiratard staring back at me.</p>

<p>With all due respect, why do you come here?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why jump to the assumption of shilling when the more likely and logical explanation is that Lellux is a karma whore or thought he was being funny?</p>

<p>And why assume all the other comments are by the same guy?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the FAR more likely explanation:</p>

<p>-3 people carry on a fairly intelligent conversation in <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a>, accumulating decent karma</p>

<ul>
<li>Then one of 2 things:</li>
</ul>

<p>-- Lellux is a karma whore, and copypastas the 3 comments to another subreddit (unlikely since it makes him look retarded replying to himself as though he were different people) OR</p>

<p>-- Just as Lellux said, he thinks he&#39;s being funny by posting the highest comments from one discussion under an identical parent comment on another discussion (he&#39;s not. still retarded and clearly more than one person can come up with the short and simple comment &quot;RIP Oculus&quot;).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Someone notices the copypasta, screen caps it, and calls him out. This becomes the highest rated comment in the discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>Others see that screenshot and try to be funny/reap karma by pasting the same comments. Just like Lellux, they are retarded and get downvoted.</p></li>
<li><p>People who want to see a conspiracy in everything <strong>assume</strong> the worst, then claim it to be irrefutable prrof. Just like all the rest, the are full re...well, you get the picture.</p></li>
