    <div class="md"><p>Hey man that means a lot! It may seem like a blob of information but if you read through the whole thing it is great stuff. Especially the readings list, a lot of this came from investigative journalism books that i have which are college accepted. </p>

<p>I intend on making future posts similar to this about propaganda and the PR industries tactics and strategies. I wish more content like this would be in this sub not just posts of articles and stuff. </p>

<p>I wan&#39;t to try to give people tools of information to be able to see through the thick cloud of &#39;spin&#39; in media instead of just providing a narrative of current events to follow through articles and opinions. </p>
