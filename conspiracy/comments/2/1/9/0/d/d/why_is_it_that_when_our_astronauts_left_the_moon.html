    <div class="md"><p>The TV camera on the rover was panned up remotely from Earth, thus showing the ascent stage of Apollo 17&#39;s LEM blasting off. Due to the delay caused by the distance between the Earth and Moon, the camera&#39;s earth-bound director/operator had to start the camera move a few seconds before blast off.  In this case, the operator timed it just right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s also worth noting that this was the third attempt at getting such a shot. The tilting didn&#39;t work when they tried it on Apollo 15, and on Apollo 16 the rover was in the wrong spot, so in both cases they failed to capture the takeoff shot they wanted.</p>

<p>The timing needs, of course, was well known. Other footage shows remote panning and such, too, so the operators had a chance to get practice in before the big moment. There is even footage of the camera panning around <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKDZmLJZVcg">after the astronauts had left</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Following the conspiracy interpretation, maybe the first attempt looked so cheesy they didn&#39;t want to keep repeating it in subsequent missions.  As I remember, the final Apollo mission was an audio-only production, supposedly because someone accidentally pointed the camera at the sun. But if you just pulled a fast one the whole world, why would you continue to show more footage, risking revealing the whole scam? Apollo 13 did a fantastic job of this, focusing the world on a dramatic event, without having to keep re-shooting complicated scenes in a studio. </p>

<p>The missions were a distraction for the public,  and a cover for a huge buildup of nuclear tipped space missiles that were necessary to deter the Russians, who were embarrassing us regularly with their milestone achievements. Though I believe in the conspiracy, I think of it more as a clever act of self preservation. Plus, now you can once again dream of being the first human to walk on the moon! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the remote control camera works in 250 degree heat and beams back the image through the radiation belts and 200,000 miles of space while the moon is traveling over 2200 mph?  And the astronauts can talk to Houston with no delay?  </p>

<p>That sounds totally believable.  How about checking the original footage?  Oops, we lost all 700 boxes, according to NASA - all videos, all blueprints, everything.</p>

<p>You can see the studio lights in photos.  Buzz Aldrin&#39;s suit changes from shot to shot.</p>

<p>The list of serious problems is staggering and everyone just accepts the standard story because it was &quot;on TV&quot;</p>

<p>People believe people landed on the moon because they heard it on the radio!  They didn&#39;t even need video to pull this off!</p>

<p>Why did they leave the color camera in the module?  Why didn&#39;t the film the earth?</p>

<p>Well, its a free country - believe what you want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.  I always thought the &quot;moon landing was a hoax&quot; crowd were ridiculous until I took the time to actually look into some of the details.  The entire story completely falls apart once you start examining the &quot;facts&quot; from a critical and open-minded standpoint.  It was pretty shocking to me to find so many gaping inconsistencies and holes in the &quot;official&quot; narrative of events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. It was very shocking to me. Not what they did, but how completely duped I was and blind to evidence right in front of my face. I am far more hesitant to blithely dismiss someone&#39;s observations just because it &quot;sounds too far-fetched.&quot;  I&#39;ll decide for myself after looking at both sides. </p>

<p>I used to be completely the opposite. Getting fooled this badly generated this change in myself and my outlook on life. </p>

<p>at about 45 secs in the camera starts to pan upward following the lander.</p>

<p>edit- i also realized after watching it again that the camera first zooms out, then aims upward.  after that I can&#39;t tell if it moved or not.</p>

<p>I cannot take this seriously. The moon landings happened. Suggesting otherwise is doing our race a disservice.</p>

<p>Do you think that during the Cold War, if there was even the <em>tiniest fraction of a chance</em> that the entire thing was made up, the Russians would not have been screaming FAAAKE! for all these decades? The didn&#39;t, they lost the space race, they know they did, they know it was absolutely for real.</p>

<p>Having these kind of crackpot theories with their ridiculous flag &#39;n shadow arguments associated with conspiracy theorists while there are <em>actual conspiracies</em> going on what with the NSA growing more and more powerful despite having been declared illegal in 2007 is exactly what we <em>don&#39;t</em> need.</p>

<p>In fact it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if these conspiracies and the whole alien space lizard nonsense were part of an NSA disinformation campaign. We know they like to divide and conquer online communities. Stuff like this plays right into their hands. But now I&#39;m venturing into my very own tinfoil hat land. We simply don&#39;t know.</p>

To justify massive(30 billion dollar) unquestioned military expenditure and to put into place whatever military programs they were establishing in space at the time. That and to gain the support of the masses in the form of a major distraction from the war. Or maybe neither of these reasons. The truth is, nobody will ever know the why and Im sure there were many reasons. That doesnt negate the fact that so much of what theyve shown us is unquestionably fake. In fact, I ask you to find one thing that actually proves that we did go to space. NASA has even admitted that theyve lost all of the data and footage of the A11 mission. There are no blueprints for the LEMS or the Rovers to be found because, well, theyve been lost as well. You mean to tell me that one of the most notable govt agencies in the world has lost all of the data proving the greatest human accomplishment of all time??? And yes, they did give fake moon rocks to other countries. I saw it in the news. that makes it real right?? Just like the silly video footage of the silly lunar modules. <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/Apollo_11_TV_Tapes_Report.pdf">http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/Apollo_11_TV_Tapes_Report.pdf</a></p>

<p>P.S.  If this contraption flew thru space, Ill eat my fuckin hat... Things made of paper ffs. Id believe a red sleigh with reindeer attached would get to the moon faster my friend. <a href="http://www.armaghplanet.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Image-of-apollo-16-ascent-stage.jpg">http://www.armaghplanet.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Image-of-apollo-16-ascent-stage.jpg</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never ascribe malice to that which can be properly explained by stupidity. The US government has done dafter things than lose some footage.</p>

<p>There&#39;s mirrors on the moon. Using those and a laser ranging experiment, they figured out that the moon moves away from us at 3,8 centimeters per year. How did they get there? Or is that entire experiment also fake? This elaborate ruse of yours is getting more and more elaborate.</p>

<p>Also, do some research. Having some layman claim that it can&#39;t possibly be real because &quot;things made of paper ffs&quot;. The Apollo was launched in a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Apollo_16_Launch_-_GPN-2000-000638.jpg">hardbody rocket</a> to get through earth&#39;s atmosphere. Out there in space, where there&#39;s no air drag, you don&#39;t need to be sleek and hard and aerodynamical, no matter what popular science fiction may claim. For example, <a href="http://www2.mps.mpg.de/images/projekte/cassini/spacecraft01.jpg">Cassini was wrapped in foil</a>. It doesn&#39;t seem sturdy, but you don&#39;t need to be sturdy in the vacuum of space.</p>

<p>What other part of common knowledge don&#39;t you believe? I seriously doubt the moon is the only one. Vaccins? Is the earth flat?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They sent a ship to the moon, they can manage video cameras. </p>

<p>Can we create a separate sub for moon landing stuff. To me its like debating whether Elvis is alive and makes the sub look like tinfoil hat people. </p>

<p>We landed on the moon. We left stuff there. The Russians would call is on it if it wasn&#39;t true and can send stuff to check. And imagine if we didnt. Who cares, it isn&#39;t exactly relevant to world politics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believing the fairy tales that the govt spoon feeds you is doing our race a disservice. So much of what weve been told about history is absolutely fabricated, why is it so hard to believe they couldnt pull the wool over your eyes with some silly video and photos?? The moon rocks are fake, the photos are fake, the video is fake, the footage has all been &quot;lost&quot; as well as the telemetric data.
