<p>If there&#39;s a rule against exposing police brutality in one of the largest sub-reddits, isn&#39;t it clear that there&#39;s something fundamentally wrong?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen, I know you guys aren&#39;t going to like this, but please read this before you downvote.</p>

<p>Many of you may remember a video posted a while back that involved an officer who shot a dog during/after a SWAT raid. The video generated a ridiculous level of controversy all over the site, from <a href="/r/ProtectAndServe">/r/ProtectAndServe</a>  to <a href="/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut">/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut</a>. Flame wars were all over the comments sections. Officers and other users who weighed in with constructive views on what happened in the video with either an explanation of tactics or constructive criticism were downvoted into oblivion and threatened through PMs. Someone posted the department&#39;s phone number and floods of people called in, tying up resources for other issues to file complaints simply from watching a youtube video. A witch hunt began, and an officer not even involved in the shooting received death threats. It was an absolute mess, and it isn&#39;t the first or last time that has happened here.</p>

<p>Simply put, these videos getting posted do absolutely no good for anyone, and lead to witch hunts that generally end pretty poorly. There are already places for police misconduct to be posted, and while they don&#39;t solve these issues from arising, there is at least less of a mob mentality behind it.</p>

<p>Now, I am not a mod on r/videos and I have no idea when this rule was put into effect, but I imagine if one of you were to contact one of them, they would give you a similar answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you even hear yourself talking? Murder on a constant basis? Are you kidding me? I&#39;m not even going to justify this with a response, keep on kidding yourself on that one.</p>

<p>The paid leave has been explained over, and over, and over, and over again. Look it up through the search bar. Multiple people have explained how the process works again and again. It is punishment, a period while the IA examines and breaks down the event. It is NOT free vacation time. Seriously, just look up some of the explanations people have done on this topic.</p>

<p>I agree with the last point. Justice needs to be served, but people need to understand a whole situation before they freak out and start riots. There are events where people should demand that justice be carried out, but there are also many events where things are out of context or policy and tactics are not understood. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could try explaining tactics and use of force to you, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll fall on deaf ears. Even if this was a valid video, it is still just one video. Now i&#39;m sure that you are gonna link me to about 30 or so videos from the past decade or so. I know that even though many are explainable, there are some that officers acted improperly. Even then, there are very few. </p>

<p>There are about 800,000 police officers in the US. Many of them will never even fire their weapon in the line of duty in their entire career as an officer. Even less will kill someone in the line of duty. Even less of those will be an improper use of force.</p>

<p>So your statement my friend, is known as a sweeping generalization. Where the actions of very few can be applied to all. So yes, are you kidding me?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that cops were caught on videos misusing their power, shows that there is not strong enough enforcement of laws to limit their power abuse. And these are just the ones caught on tape. </p>

<p>If what you are saying is true, and their punishments are equal to their crimes, then these cops wouldn&#39;t be committing them in the first place. They are supposed to be the enforcers of the laws, and if they break laws and abuse their powers, they should be severely punished because more is expected from them than from citizens. Instead they get smaller punishments, which makes them seem like they are above ordinary citizens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to lie to you guys, I am pro-police, but I am not for the suppression of free speech. If <a href="/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut">/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut</a> wants to post about police misconduct, be it true or untrue, more power to them. I actually welcome much of their content because it provides a platform for either learning what was done wrong or incorrectly, or an opportunity to explain tactics and why things are done the way they are done. But when these things are posted to <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a> or any other large-population subreddit (remember the Boston Bombing?) the hive mind can lead to some really bad stuff happening. Sometimes videos lack context and can be misleading. I think the mods made a good decision to stop allowing such videos to be posted, leaving them instead for more specific subreddits.</p>

<p>And yes, when misconduct happens, people should get pissed. First I urge to examine the whole situation and seek out context, but if no valid reason is found, there is every right to be outraged, and using this anger in a constructive way can actually lead to a desirable outcome like at the very least better exposure for an issue that needs to be addressed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are some issues with this:</p>

<p>Your advice that they should post to relevant subreddits is essentially saying that such videos shouldn&#39;t reach such large crowds and only stay with small ones. Smaller crowds are have less significant effect (or no effect) on ensuring that justice will be served, and therefore, what you are saying is only going to be a way through which we can rant and feel better... while letting the cops get away with murder. </p>

<p>So these things need to get to large crowds, and therefore it is censorship to prevent videos such as this from being posted on <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a>. </p>

<p>The solution shouldn&#39;t be to prevent videos such as this reaching the citizens because that would be censorship, but rather the solution should be to hold police officers responsible for their actions, without people feeling the need to find justice on their own. If the system worked and police were always tried for their crimes, then people wouldn&#39;t be taking matters into their own hands. </p>

<p>Many cops let power go to their heads and have little value for citizen life, and videos that get posted are clear signs of it. Instead of trying to patch up the image of cops by controlling the reach of these videos, they should actually be punishing those cops properly for misusing their power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Content should reach people, but if people are misinformed or things are out of context (the video that was posted from the dog shooting was cut and lacked some important details from the incident if I recall) serious, real life problems can arise very, very quickly.

    <div class="md"><p>I watched the video myself and you can see where the dog started out, and follow the video without any edits until it was shot. </p>

<p>So I am not sure what was edited out. Again, I am not a cop hater if they don&#39;t deserve it, and so if you can show me otherwise, I am all open to it. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, if you want things to be context, then they can simply ask cops to always wear video cameras on them, and make it public. There needs to be someone who watches those that watch us. It will prevent power from going to their heads and making them think they are some sort of higher class citizens. </p>

<p>Disagree. They do good for society by exposing corrupt police.
If there is a problem with witch hunts then make rules around that, not around the content of the video. Any video could result in a witch hunt.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like fighting against the censorship of a newspaper that has a monopoly on the region, and thinking the solution to that is to create your own newspaper. There is no way you can compete and that is realistically, not an actual solution to fight censorship. </p>
