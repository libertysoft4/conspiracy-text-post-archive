<p>I knew something funny was going on when I submitted a post critical of Monsanto to <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> and it got upvoted 3 times in a minute (and no downvotes) and the <em>same</em> post to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> got downvoted twice in seconds.</p>

<p>Edit: Honestly I don&#39;t give a shit about downvotes. I&#39;m just trying to find out if there are any legit users here anymore. I&#39;m really starting to wonder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here.  Though I do agree with you, it&#39;s been a bit of an echo chamber lately.  Kinda creepy when I&#39;ve gone to check a few users&#39; pages who I know were legit and finding that their accounts have been deleted.</p>

<p>A few off the top of my head are:
<a href="/u/Gooiesc">/u/Gooiesc</a> 
<a href="/u/cccpcharm">/u/cccpcharm</a> 
<a href="/u/InternetPropagandist">/u/InternetPropagandist</a> (though it looks like he was re-instated - still banned from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>)
<a href="/u/Bubba-Booey">/u/Bubba-Booey</a> </p>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>Edit: And <em>immediately</em>, both of my posts here get downvoted.  The fuck?</p>

I notice that &quot;problem users&quot; (i.e. those who are outspoken and articulate) often seem to receive instant downvotes on any comment or post, regardless of topic, as if they&#39;re being &quot;shadowed&quot;.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s also the weird cases I&#39;ve seen people mention where they&#39;ve created private subs that only they know about yet still see things like &quot;4 people here&quot; in their sub despite the fact that no one other than them should know about it.</p>

<p>I just wonder if we&#39;ve gotten to the point where the bots themselves have started making comments as if they were people.  It wouldn&#39;t surprise me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s something that crossed my mind in reading these posts about the /new queue... a sort of hypothesis test.</p>

<p>For example, your Monsanto post:</p>

<p>Post the same link twice, first with the word Monsanto, and second with otnasnoM (i.e., Monsanto backwards) immediately after.  </p>

<p>If the first gets downvotes and the second does not, it would be, IMO, preliminary evidence of automated bot voting (headline keyword parsing from the rss feed - which is virtually untraceable except by the voting responses).</p>

<p>EDIT: p.s. test this with an alt account. regular posters might also be targeted for downvotes.</p>

<p>Am I missing something? How can a sub this controversial allow a mechanism for ideas to be censored so easily by so few?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a great idea and one that&#39;s been considered before, but I see the potential for a different type of problem, namely people massively upvoting bullshit to the top.</p>

<p>This sub already has that problem, but it would get much worse. It helps to be able to downvote stupid images and stuff.</p>

<p>Also, even if we disable downvotes, the serious shills/trolls will just get around it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if &quot;new&quot; was the front page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> instead of &quot;Hot&quot;? </p>

<p>Once a post gets so many up votes, it gets moved to &quot;rising&quot;.</p>

<p>Then after so many more up votes, the post move on to &quot;hot&quot; or call it something else.</p>

<p>That way we can immediately save a post that looks worthy of a discussion from being sent down the hole. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A working hypothesis I currently haven&#39;t ruled out pertains to the new bot User_History_Bot. This is very much the bane of post/comment trolls/shills. Any time you find someone trolling, simply post a history request and bang, no accusation of shilling, just and investigation which reveals relevant info. Dead troll/shill.</p>

<p>So, it only stands to reason that, in order to continue to discredit this sub, those who&#39;ve been doing it (the <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and <a href="/r/subredditdrama">/r/subredditdrama</a> overlap crowd) have to change their tactic - downvote real conspiracies and upvote drama/quackery.</p>

<p>Specific example of the quackery part is the Lellux debacle (currently #1 on frontpage with 2k upvotes - far and away above normal for a typical 5-600 upvote post that makes #1). The dramatists feed the drama they want to mock. Lellux is, quite obviously, a karma whore (despite the large number of &quot;sports buffs&quot; who turned out in defense of one of the accounts Lellux had copied). Everything that looks suspicious isn&#39;t necessarily a conspiracy.</p>

<p>The current state of angst resulting from unprecedented oppression and surveillance has many people hoping to catch - and make an example of - just <em>one</em>... one <em>real</em> douchebag.</p>

<p>Admit it: You&#39;d like to catch one, too. Right?</p>

<p>reddit (the company) <em>could</em> catch nearly all of them. they don&#39;t, so we flounder amid the abuse.</p>

<p>tl;dr: fear of being outed may have the trolls/dramatists/shills shifting their activity to the voting process to avoid being noticed... and, apparently, that fear is nominally justified.</p>
