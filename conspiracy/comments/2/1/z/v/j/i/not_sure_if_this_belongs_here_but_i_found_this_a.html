<p>Again, not sure if this is the appropriate subreddit (so downvote if you wish), but it does seem a bit odd to me...</p>

<p><em>&quot;Safety is our highest priority, and we are committed to protecting the most vulnerable victims of backover accidents — our children and seniors,&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;On average, there are 210 fatalities and 15,000 injuries per year caused by backover crashes.&quot;</em></p>

<p>210 fatalities per year is quite a low number on the grand scale, no?</p>

<p>I might be grasping at straws here, but I call &quot;bullshit&quot;.  Seems like a gov&#39;t&#39;s dream - more cameras in things that most of us use!  Most auto manufacturers would have most likely had cameras regardless by 2018, but making it mandatory?  To allegedly lower a petty number of 210 fatalities/year?  </p>

<p>I also think this reliance on technology, as opposed to our own senses, is making us dumber as a society, and the fact that things like this are becoming &quot;required&quot; is concerning...turning into Idiocracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see where this could be conspiracy territory. </p>

<p>Seatbelts were adamantly rejected. I literally have a friend who doesn&#39;t wear one due to her upbringing. Safety wasn&#39;t always the #1 of cars. </p>

<p>But now cars are becoming safer. This includes cameras. So, how can we figure out the cameras are for negative purposes?  We can&#39;t and we&#39;re simply speculating.</p>

<p>Be wary of being paranoid. There could always be legitimate people behind the movement who has a genuine concern for safety. We need not be painted as seeing conspiracies in everything.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>conspiracy can be systematic in addition to the notion of a bunch of old men sitting at a round table in a dark room.</p>

<p>On the one hand- you can guarantee that there is a corporate lobby pushing this mandate.  It&#39;s going to make money for people- the hardware people, the software people and the data people.  This will certainly somehow be incorporated into the insurance calculation.</p>

<p>But there is an understanding that as technology increases its grasp on our day to day, humans lose agency and autonomy (liberty).  &quot;Conspiracy Theorists&quot; tend to see that these freedoms are disappearing and are worried about this loss of independence.</p>
