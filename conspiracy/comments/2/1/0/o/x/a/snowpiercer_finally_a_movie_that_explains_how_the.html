<p>Watched it today. What a blast of intelligent satire and exposition about how the ruling elites control modern society. I wasn&#39;t able to feel as good as today since I saw The Matrix. Finally another movie that explains what is going on right to your face. It feels great.</p>

<p>Highly recommened to anybody who liked The Matrix, or Brazil.</p>

<p>You will see how in the beginning quite anything does not makes sense. But as soon as the movie progress forward, you will be more and more shown and explained why it is all happening.</p>

<p>After this movie you will feel way more confident about why and how exactly the revolutions take pace. One thing is speculating alone about the news in front of a tv, another thing is when somebody else is telling you the same from a masterfully crafted media.</p>

<p>It feels really good when the massmedia are used by friends to free your mind, not the enemies trying to brainwash.</p>

The Matrix is an amazing peace of cinema and an amazing story this film touches on it but it does feel dumbed down i would like the film to be a lot longer and in more depth </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. This movie is too much visual. At least 5 - 10 minutes of more dialogue explaining all the plot metaphors like in Matrix would be way better. The ending was good though, at least it was a pretty straight to the face explanation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Viewed this yesterday. I was impressed with the social dynamics, and just how closely they resemble what we see throughout the world. It reminds me of the quote:</p>

<p>&#39;Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts..absolutely&#39;</p>

<p>That very theme is the same for governments, law enforcement, the wealthy/affluent..and any similar entity with power. It&#39;s always been this way.. and it will continue, unless the oppressed rise up.</p>

The last shot of the film really impressed me as well. Everything came full circle at that point to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You obviously didn&#39;t like the movie. But that doesn&#39;t mean that you can just be a dick about it. Taste in film is subjective, just like it is for favorite foods and favorite musical genres. Just because someone&#39;s taste is different than yours, that does not mean you need to insult their intelligence.</p>

<p>I also think you are probably the person who is down voting anyone who is trying to discuss this movie. That&#39;s just ridiculous. Please stop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you&#39;re being childish. Again, when you call a comment &quot;dumb ass&quot; dumb implies a lack of intelligence. Just because you disagree with something, especially something as subjective as taste in movies, does not mean it lacks intelligence. You shouldn&#39;t &#39;t use Reddit to simply down vote anything you disagree with or don&#39;t like and write &quot;dumb ass&quot; numerous times on a post...</p>

<ul>
<li>the poor breed more children
I wonder why poor people who understand the pain more about being poor ( starvation, violence, etc ) choose to having babies ? do they really think that their children wont be suffering too ? the only way out from poverty is only if your kid is very very smart, so they can get scholarship till university then make a better living, but chance is slim, very very very slim. Im poor too and I know the best what is it feel to be poor, and if Im stay poor, I wont having baby coz I dont want my child will suffer like me</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s not forget that humans reproduction is based on instincts, rather than logic. And that without contraceptives it is pretty hard to stop reproducing, even if it is the end of the world. Only some people with strong minds can override their instincts by rationality. Like those who chose becoming vegetarians, even if they know that meat tastes delicious. The same goes for some people who are able to not procreate to stop children suffering. The majority of people will Always be driven by instincts, which means eating meat and procreate, unless the government would make laws to stop people doing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a long story, bro. Unfortunately the rights for the film belong to Weinstein. He decided to boycott the movie by not allowing a wide release. </p>

<p>So if you are unable find it in a theater near you, your options are limited to torrenting right now, or wating when avaiable on streaming pay sites or discs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I also liked this movie a lot.
I got interested because I love movies in which all the action is happening inside a closed space and I love post-apocalyptic movies.  However, I didn&#39;t expect it to have some deeper meaning, but I was pleasantly surprised.</p>

<p>It has some pratfalls, but they don&#39;t spoil the experience. I think everyone should watch it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuckin&#39; <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. I wish you were a fuckin&#39; conspiracy and then at least I&#39;d have an easier time denying your existence.  You&#39;re all fuckin&#39; dumb. This movie isn&#39;t that good and &#39;finally a movie that explains how the elites control society&#39;!? Films have been assessing and critiquing the notion of a ruling class with simultaneously greater subtly and depth than this science fiction blockbuster since cinema began. </p>

<p>Edit</p>

<p>This film isn&#39;t going to be cut for US audiences. All the comments about this reflecting real world are fuckin&#39; dumb. Yes, there is a ruling class and a class that is ruled but the discourse surrounding this notion is far from adequately explored in this film. </p>

<p>Another Edit</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the link you dumb fucks. </p>
