        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I see that debunkers only have 4 or so elements to use in their rationale of how the Twin Towers came down...</p>

<ul>
<li>Impact of a plane hitting the building to weaken the structure (only for WTC1 &amp; WTC2, not WTC7)</li>
<li>A portion of jet fuel &amp; office room material for fire combustion to weaken the structure</li>
<li>Gravity to bring the building down</li>
<li>Air Compression to blow out windows and other stuff on lower floors as it came down</li>
</ul>

<p>Meanwhile, we have the following elements (with picture/video/eyewitness evidence) to infer a much more realistic reason as to how the Twin Towers came down...</p>

<ul>
<li>Explosions in the lower floors</li>
<li>Squibs</li>
<li>Ejecta</li>
<li>Diagonal cuts</li>
<li>Thermite residue</li>
<li>Molten steel</li>
<li>Molten concrete</li>
<li>Pulverization</li>
<li>Victims vaporized</li>
<li>Free-fall speed</li>
<li>Symmetric fall</li>
</ul>

<p>These elements fit exactly with a controlled demolition... not a natural gravity collapse with the help from some jet fuel &amp; office room materials.</p>

<p>As time goes by it gets more and more ridiculous that there has not been another investigation into this event... which again makes it more obvious it&#39;s a lie and they know it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe not directly but it does show us just how much we turn our brains off when we tune into TV.</p>

<p>The first time I realized this was when I started listening to Howard Stern. I&#39;d hear him rag on some show I had watched and I realized just how lame and shitty it was, and how my brain was basically turned off when I was watching it. They could put almost anything on that box and I&#39;d be satisfied with it.</p>

<p>I think this is why there is always so much pushback to anyone promoting counter-culture. It gets thinking outside of the box and you quickly wake up to the absurdity of things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do agree with you.  It&#39;s sad that we humans are so easily manipulated, every psychopath does it without thinking, first they amuse you, then flatter you then stick the knife in (either figuratively or actually).  </p>

<p>There are several little things they do, for instance did you know your unconscious mind doesn&#39;t understand negatives?  So if I say, Tom Cruise is not gay, he most certainly is not gay, he has never had a gay lover - your unconscious thinks he is gay and has had a gay lover.  Little tricks like this can be used to push your mind into a direction that has no benefit for you, whilst the powers that be can remain seeming innocent because they can say &#39;we did tell you not to do that&#39;.  LOL.  </p>

<p>Being human can suck sometimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TV is a push-model, where you turn on your TV and content is &quot;pushed&quot; at you. If you dont like the content, you can switch to another &quot;push&quot; channel, but it will always be pushed content.</p>

<p>Youtube, on the other hand, is a pull-model, where you go to youtube and typically search for something specific, then click to pull that content. When you are done watching one video, you have the opportunity to pull up other relavent content.</p>

<p>The difference may seem trivial, but its absolutely revolutionary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh fuck. I&#39;ve gone down the rabbit hole, I&#39;ve seen where we are going. </p>

<p>It&#39;s depressing on all angles. The end game is so sad and malicious, and people are willing and able because of consumer greed. We are all so pathetic in the end. </p>

<p>But why? What is the point of a slave race or any of the end game shit? It&#39;s all shitty and turbulent for all those involved. Nobody wins really. Then there&#39;s the whole, &quot;everyone for everybody&quot; idea. Science, art, math, ecology. Right NOW we could begin our race wide thesis in action on symbiosis with our environment, down falls, shortcomings. I don&#39;t understand. </p>

<p>In the end, all we have proven is the ability to forsake everything that makes us unique for that illusive banana at the top of the stairs. The poor, the elite, everyone. Just because your the one video taping the monkeys beat each other for trying to get the banana doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t intrinsically fucking chained to the event. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say the elite destroy our planet or kill everyone off or let&#39;s say there&#39;s is no elite like that and we just fuck ourselves, both have the same conclusion! </p>

<ul>
<li><p>no problems were solved</p></li>
<li><p>human population suddenly derived of snakes, liars and backstabbing murderers addicted to vapid power</p></li>
<li><p>set back ages fighting for the leash when so much more could have been done, and everyone live better! Population control would be a joke, you would want more people.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I don&#39;t get it, as in the ruling class. Everyone else I get, cia, fbi. Just scubs like me trying to get ahead in the shallow pool of consumers. Ready to kill just to get ahead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s how the debunkers logic works:</p>

<p>D: &quot;You make claims then present evidence of your claims. You don&#39;t have evidence then those claims are worthless.&quot;</p>

<p>CT: &quot;We asked for the evidence corroborating the NIST&#39;s claims and to this day they still haven&#39;t provided anything. According to you their claims are worthless.&quot;</p>

<p>D: &quot;No, I am talking about you guys, you are the ones that believe in UFOs and Aliens, don&#39;t try to change subject.&quot;</p>

<p>CT: &quot;I am not, you criticize me for not providing evidence for my claims but you do not request the same thing from the ones you defend and still you consider mine worthless because of this but NIST isn&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p>D: &quot;Sure, because one million men rigged the towers with 1000000000tons of explosives and nobody saw a thing, this theory is retarded.&quot;</p>

<p>CT: &quot;Why do you keep changing subject?&quot;</p>

<p>D: &quot;Why do you? What, am I a shill now? Is that it? LOL I&#39;m making lots of cash for something that I really enjoy, lololol!&quot;</p>

<p>CT: &quot;It is clear now that you do not have interest in discussing reasonably and for that reason this discussion is over.&quot;</p>

<p>D: &quot;Awww look at you, running away when you are proved wrong. Run away then, you just proved me right, again, AHAHAHAH!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yah pretty much... because believing that the official story of 9/11 is lie means some extremely terrible stuff has happened much much worse than most people are willing to accept.</p>

<p>It means all this happened based on a lie:</p>

<ul>
<li>2,996 immediate (attack time) deaths</li>
<li>Respiratory illnesses for countless NYPD &amp; FDNY people (and other first responders)</li>
<li>All the death/destruction on both sides of the invasion of Afghanistan</li>
<li>All the death/destruction on both sides of the invasion of Iraq</li>
<li>Countless dollars spent feeding the military industrial complex</li>

<p>obviously the list goes on...</p>

<p>from all the missing SSDI names, the oddities and structural naming of passenger names.</p>

<p>the actual death count for 9/11 is far lower, prob only 500 incidental casualties. but there were deaths, and the long term health effects for first responders and anybody else that lived or worked nearby, Brooklyn Queens etc. pretty nasty. all that concrete and asbestos dust went somewhere, into peoples lungs and offices and homes.</p>

<p>He stated that :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The NIST obviously will say the building would have collapsed inevitably from the fires it sustained because the firefighters had no water pressure anymore and the fire had reached a critical point where it was able to spread in a steel-framed building. It&#39;s a dumb thought experiment anyways because there would have been no fire if debris hadn&#39;t hit the building.</p>

<p>To which I stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>False. The firefighters had plenty of water from the river boats that were there supplying them even long before WTC7 collapsed.</p>

<p>Ignoring the alternative explanations (or &#39;debunkings&#39;) of those points - how do they &quot;fit exactly with a controlled demolition&quot; and not a collapse?</p>

<p>How would controlled demolition explain molten concrete (not a claim I&#39;m actually familiar with)? Or molten steel (assuming we&#39;re talking about the &#39;rivers&#39; of it witnessed in the debris pile)?</p>

<p>If free-fall speed were achieved and were only possible with demolition wouldn&#39;t there have needed to be much more dramatic and severe explosions that potentially evidenced in the videos?</p>

<p>How is it that explosives (apparently thermite, not a traditional explosives) could explain pulverized material and &#39;vapourized&#39; victims, but collapse couldn&#39;t? Surely if the energy of the collapse of more 1.5 million tons of tower wasn&#39;t enough to do it, then the explosions required would be massive and completely undeniable?</p>

<p>Basically I don&#39;t feel like arguing all those points - if you want to see alternative explanations for all that I&#39;m sure you&#39;re capable of finding those online. My point is that even if we took all that as correct, I don&#39;t think those things are evidence of a controlled demolition the way you suggest.</p>

<p>Faster than freefall? What does that even mean - it&#39;s clearly absurd. Nothing was falling faster than gravity.</p>

<p>What on earth could make it take one minute to collapse if we leave aside the resistance of the lower part of the tower? It would take about 9 seconds for any given object to fall 400m (roughly 100 floors up).</p>

<p>Specifically this one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Second, a fifth-floor fire burned for up to 7 hours. <strong>&quot;There was no firefighting in WTC 7,&quot;</strong> Sunder says. Investigators believe the fire was fed by tanks of diesel fuel that many tenants used to run emergency generators. Most tanks throughout the building were fairly small, but a generator on the fifth floor was connected to a large tank in the basement via a pressurized line. Says Sunder: &quot;Our current working hypothesis is that this pressurized line was supplying fuel [to the fire] for a long period of time.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And Sunder is the director of the NIST, investigating the fires and cause of the collapse himself, so you would think he would not make that kind of mistake, this also pairs up nicely with the Silverstein &#39;pull it&#39; quote, claiming that he was referring to the &#39;remaining&#39; firefighters in the building.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with the NIST conclusions is that they built the entire study on the prior assumption that fires brought the buildings down. Instead of analyzing the evidence and arriving at a conclusion, they started with a conclusion and only accepted the data that supported the conclusion, ignoring any data that didn&#39;t fit the assumed model. Also there is the lack of peer review of the study, the lack of historical precedence and seemingly no way to replicate the study results, something any conclusive scientific study should be able to stand up to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love a good conspiracy but 9/11 ain&#39;t one of em.  Let me go through all your points.</p>

<p>The impact of the plane explains an awful lot.  Firstly, the twin towers used asbestos as a fire retardant, this is brilliant when it&#39;s in place, but when a plane hits asbestos it shatters into dust leaving zero fire protection for the steel.  </p>

<p>Now you have a fire with thousands of gallons of aviation fuel, fed by two currents of oxygen (one front one rear) - having the buildings close to one another causes a rush of air in two directions, great for blowing women&#39;s skirts in the air, but not so good if you have a fire and front to back of both buildings allow the air in.  This effectively trapped the oxygen in the building and gave a constant supply of oxygen to fuel the fire even further.  The plane is made of hundreds of tons of aluminium, which has a melting point of merely 1200f - this fire burned hotter than that.  The fire raging, the molten aluminium etc all pouring down the central column, which now has zero fire protection on it will weaken the steel.  The steel didn&#39;t have to melt, it merely had to weaken.</p>

<p>This central column held up the entire building, all of the building&#39;s strength came from this central column, with the steel now weakened it only has to give a little and the whole damned lot comes down.  Which it did.</p>

<p>Also, the explosions in the basement.  Remember that plane we spoke about, the one that just hit the tower?  That smashed into the central column, the shockwave would have been instant, it would have sent plaster, metal and all that yummy asbestos flying throughout the building, but mostly on the lower floors.  The people in the basement would see it explode and think it was an explosion (which it was), moments later (because of the time it takes for sound to travel) they&#39;d have heard the roar of the plane hitting the building.  So they&#39;d naturally think &#39;explosion first, then aircraft hit&#39; - because to them that&#39;s what happened.</p>

<p>The collapsed buildings would have weakened WTC7 substantially, it too had fires within it.  If it had been blown up it would have taken a long time to prep, nobody has come forward to say they prepped this building, so we have to assume it collapsed because it was weakened.  Although WTC7 is my big question mark!  It is the one thing that makes me question everything else - if they blew that up, it would have taken a lot of prep.  Also, if they blew that up then maybe they blew the other two too.  It is a nag with me.</p>

<p>The squibs could very well be air pressure - the twin towers fell in a concertina way, so air pressure build up in the building would have been very strong, and have caused the squibs and the windows breaking.</p>

<p>There was no molten steel - the molten metal they saw would have been molten aluminum - remember there are now quite  few extra tons of aluminum because of the aircraft itself.  </p>

<p>The melting aircraft also explains why there ain&#39;t nothing left of the passengers or the aircraft itself.</p>

<p>Symmetric fall - we&#39;ve already done that - only the central core column had any substantial strength, the rest of the building was pretty piss weak in comparison, so the central core acts as both a support for the collapse - keeping it straight (at free fall - because the floors are heavy)  and the cause of the collapse - because you should never rely on just a central core for a building&#39;s strength.  </p>

<p>Victims vaporized because of things like plastic, asbestos glass, concrete - every single floor that went down would literally explode, you saw the dust for yourself - now go and stand in front of a sandblaster turned up to full power and you&#39;ll see how people were vaporized.</p>

<p>What happened afterwards - the obvious planting of passports, cooking up evidence against people in order to have a war, now that probably is a conspiracy, but the actual event itself wasn&#39;t.   I don&#39;t think!</p>

<p>sorry man, this didn&#39;t sway me at all... even you admit there are huge holes in the story in your post... and even if it was just not a controlled demolition, the US government sure took advantage of the situation and went and created more war and innocent killings based on this event that they will not allow any outside scientific investigation to happen proving they know it&#39;s a lie.</p>

<p>It very briefly reached approximate free fall. About 2-3 seconds of the 14 seconds of structural failure.</p>

<p>There is hundreds of pages of detailed data in their report. The model itself hasn&#39;t been released, but the data it&#39;s created from is available. What, aside from that model, do you suggest NIST is withholding? </p>

<p>It <em>is</em> the case - the vast majority of all those groups have no issue with the official reports, but they don&#39;t feel the need to create groups to express that. Not a single one of the &quot;Someone for 9/11 Truth&quot; groups has even close to a significant level of support within the group they claim to represent.</p>

<p>I agree the US certainly did take advantage - especially with Iraq (while Afghanistan was at least a reasonable response to the event). </p>

<p>But it&#39;s hardly true that they won&#39;t allow outside scientific investigation - the collapses of the WTC towers (including WTC7) are the most studied building failures ever. Reports and studies have been published by various groups all over the world and all, basically, agree with the conclusions reached by NIST.</p>

<p>I could concede there&#39;s a possibility that US agencies knew more than is admitted and potentially even deliberately avoided acting on some information that ultimately allowed 9/11 to take place - although I don&#39;t think it&#39;s likely or well supported. But beyond that I don&#39;t think the bulk of 9/11 conspiracy theory is supported by evidence, or even necessarily logically consistent.</p>

The threat level against the US was huge and they knew an attack was imminent (so they say) - so maybe they just waited for some nut to do something and then they planted the evidence.

<p>We&#39;re asked to take NIST&#39;s word for this and now yours. It&#39;s not proof. The testing NIST did involved shooting a shotgun at a coated beam.  Speculation and poor testing does not add up to conclusive proof.</p>

<p>FBI report on the Israeli men arrested in New York on 9/11. You won&#39;t find a rebuttal to this report on the internet but you will find skeptics taking apart the news reports from around the time it happened. This was obtained in 2011 under FOIA request. A lot of the evidence collected proves to me they had foreknowledge of the attacks and they definitely celebrated the burning twin towers. Who celebrated the burning twin towers on September 11th in New York?</p>

<p>Since it&#39;s so long, this is a good TL;DR..</p>

<p>This is what was supposedly translated from the video segment.  I find those words used to be quite strange and chilling.  Is this a direct translation?  Is there any other way to interpret the language used here?  What else could they mean by &quot;purpose&quot;, and did they admit to knowing in advance?</p>

<p>Where are these people now?  The whole thing seems too strange to be just a coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eyewitness (several of them) testified to the FBI the men were in the car park which was a vantage point over New York before the first plane hit and were recording footage of the twin towers. Then the FBI developed the camera which shown the men celebrating the attacks. I&#39;m pretty sure anyone would find the celebration of an attack which was being recorded before it happened suspicious. Not only that but the men lived in close proximity to the 9/11 hijackers in several places, the company was not registered (a fake), the owner of the company fled before being questioned back to Israel, they had a lot of cash and came from different countries and had tickets to fly out right after 9/11 which is SOP for intelligence, they had maps with places of importance and one of the men confirmed he was a map maker in the IDF, they refused lie detectors and failed and also lied to the FBI, they were in the county illegally, were caught not far from the Pennsylvania crash site in another van, people connected to them were arrested in Miami from another moving company which the actual 9/11 hijackers used and more.</p>

<p>I think everyone should read this to understand for themselves what they are looking at. It&#39;s not good me telling you because you need to see it for yourself. The documents are from the source so there is no accusations of it being bias.</p>

<p>And by the way, your argument makes no sense and I&#39;ve seen the same excuse before. How would they know the US was going to not be able to ignore terrorism when everyone thought the first plane was an accident? Because they were there celebrating the first plane crash, which is corroborated by eyewitnesses and the camera. So what your saying in your argument is that they knew that the first plane crash was terrorists when no one else knew that including the media. The media reported it an accident until the second plane hit then it was thought to be a terror attack.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;On 09/11/2001, [blank] woke up at approximately 7:30 AM. She recalls the time because her husband woke her as he got prepared for jury duty in Newark, New Jersey (NJ). As her husband was showering and getting dressed, [blank] prepared the coffee and placed a bagel in the oven.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;Her husband went downstairs to purchase a newspaper at to [sic] the store located on the ground floor of the apartment complex. He returned and they had breakfast together.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>&quot;<strong>Her husband then left for jury duty at approximately 8:25 AM or 8:30 AM. She then telephonically contacted GENERAL CAB COMPANY for a cab to take her son, [blank] to [blank]. After she contacted the cab company, her son waited in the lobby area for the cab.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;[Blank&#39;s] neighbors who reside in apartment [blank] left their daughter, [blank] with [blank] to babysit. As these neighbors left the apartment complex, they saw [blank&#39;s son] waiting for the cab so they transported him to college.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>&quot;<strong>At approximately 9:00 AM, [blank] in apartment [blank] telephonically contacted [blank] to tell her that she saw smoke coming from the WORLD TRADE CENTER (WTC), in New York City. [Blank] then grabbed her Binolux binoculars, (lightweight triple tested, 7 x 35 mm, 341 feet at 1000 yards) in order to see the WTC closely.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;[Blank] recalls that she was listening to 1010 AM news radio station [this would be WINS] and she did not hear any information regarding the WTC. She recalls that the sun had risen, it was a clear day and there was no fog or clouds.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;Joan Fleischer, an account executive on the WINS sales team, was very close to the Towers from her rooftop on North Moore Street. She noticed a plane flying much lower than she had ever seen before in the New York City skies, and knew it was going to crash. She called the WINS newsroom and spoke to Mark Mason, the former executive editor at WINS. As she said, &quot;There&#39;s going to be a plane crash,&quot; the plane tilted to the left and slammed into the building. It hit just as she said, &quot;crash&quot;. Mason called Fleischer back &quot;from a line that could be patched into the studio on the air&quot;, and since they had someone from the station on the scene as it unfolded, they were able to go &quot;with such a live report&quot;. The audio is available at this page.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;Breaking news now, on 1010 WINS. This just in to our newsroom; a plane has crashed into the World Trade Center. Let&#39;s get this live update from 1010 WINS correspondent Joan Fleischer. Joan, what do you see?&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;Well I&#39;m standing on the top of my roof, and I&#39;m looking at the World Trade Center, and there&#39;s a huge hole in it, and there&#39;s a fire in the building right now, huge smoke pouring out of it, and things are falling from the building itself. [...] I heard the plane, very close to the top of the buildings. I looked outside, and I saw it hit, and it exploded immediately.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;At nearly eight minutes into the live report, the second plane hadn&#39;t hit - which occurred at 9:03. The eyewitness was listening to the station and could not have missed hearing the news. Thus, this fixes an absolute latest time for the eyewitness to have gone to look outside at 8:55; eight-and-a-half minutes after the first impact at approximately 8:46:30. However, that would be ridiculous because it requires that WINS was so incompetent that it took more than eight minutes to call Joan Fleischer back &quot;from a line that could be patched into the studio on the air&quot; to go live with such an important breaking news report. The Israelis&#39; version of events also requires that CNN&#39;s website and the Israeli news site YNET were so quick off the mark that they had already posted the news on their web sites for the Israelis to read about it. Then the three Israelis had to have collectively decided that the event was worthy of taking time off work to go away and &quot;document&quot; it for historical purposes, collected cameras, back packs and notebooks, rushed out to their employer&#39;s van, driven through rush-hour traffic to an observation point chosen on the spur of the moment that is normally a four or five-minute drive from Urban Moving Systems&#39; office, driven into the Doric Towers apartment complex at 100 Manhattan Avenue in Union City, around to the rear parking lot, parked at an angle to the fence so that the front of the van faced in a south-southeast direction towards the WTC, got out of the van with the cameras, climbed onto the roof, and started their cameras rolling, all before the local AM news station managed to announce the breaking news.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;It&#39;s pretty obvious that the Israelis were sighted by this eyewitness at 8:51 or earlier (see Section 3 page 67), making the Israelis&#39; version of events physically and scientifically impossible without a suspension of the laws of causality and General Relativity. And this is corroborated by the fact that the eyewitness&#39; friend was prompted to telephone her &quot;immediately&quot; after hearing the first plane crash, looking out and seeing the smoke; by another eyewitness who saw the Israelis &quot;less than 5 minutes&quot; after the first plane impact; by a third eyewitness who saw a white van with no side windows arrive and park in the same apartment block rear parking lot at 8:15 and found it was gone by 9:20; by a fourth eyewitness who saw a white van parked in the same parking lot and estimated the time to be as early as 8:00am; and by a fifth eyewitness who spotted Sivan Kurzberg at the Doric Towers apartment complex the day before 9/11.]&quot;</strong></p>

<p>I guess you could call that circumstantial evidence that these guys were also Israeli nationals working for a moving company that was used by one of the terrorists involved in 9/11. But then that links them to the other Israeli nationals working for a moving co play suspected to be involved in 9/11 who were under investigation.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Whether they were directly involved or not would mean they didn&#39;t (at least) alert the US to knowledge of an a attack. At worst, some of the evidence points to them knowing and possibly aiding the terrorists since they had interacted at some points like when one of the terrorists used the moving company in Miami.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, the fact that they were celebrating attacks on 9/11 makes me question the motives around the celebrations. Who exactly would celebrate an attack on the US and for what purpose? What did they believe was cause for celebration and what did the execution of the attack imply for them?</p>

<p>The fact that they were Israeli in context with other parts of 9/11, namely the planning in my view of 9/11 before 2001 by people aligned with Israel.</p>

<p>The fact that they were in the US for quite a long time but had booked tickets to leave immediately after 9/11 which has been shown to be the case in other MOSSAD operations. Given the fact that they were under investigation and considering what else was suspicious, this is another suspicion that they picked a date to leave right after a major event in which they were documenting.</p>

<p>The fact that Dominik Suter left the United States before being questioned by the FBI in a hurry.</p>

<p>None of that matters because you can read the FBI report and be near certain they were there before the first plane hit and even the day before in the same place.

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t need to determine what happened that day. How the buildings fell is a great distraction but that&#39;s all it is. Why do you think debunkers focus on how the buildings fell all the time? The fact is a conclusion will never be reached, and all the while people throw evidence back and forth while claiming each other&#39;s is incomplete or fabricated. <strong>It&#39;s irrelevant</strong>. They fell. The method of their falling is completely irrelevant when considering motive and who carried out the attack, whicb is what needs to be established before justice can be exacted.</p>

<p>Where is the focus on Silverstein&#39;s ownership of the buildings and insurance payouts? The employees of certain firms who were told to stay home? The SEC documents that were destroyed? Investigation into Dov Zakheim&#39;s involvement? Israeli-controlled airports? The PNAC&#39;s Rebuilding America&#39;s Defenses? The trillions missing from the Pentagon? It goes on and on. For fuck sake - <strong>follow the money</strong>. It was planned as a pretext for war and lots of people made money from it, but whether the building was rigged is a moot point. So many people wasting their time arguing semantics and the temperature of melting steel. The consequences of 9/11 were huge. This stuff is <em>not</em> what&#39;s important.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can agree with what you are saying... but I feel that if we can get the US to realize the official story is a lie... then we can finally follow the money and connect real people to this event.</p>

<p>So it is important how these buildings fell because it allows us to see the entire story is a lie which will then open up money trail to our culprits.</p>

<p>Either way its all important... but I can see your frustration on getting lost in how hot the steel needed to be etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to the public opinion poll included in Frank Luntz&#39;s Global Language Dictionary, Israel benefitted from 9/11 because American public opinion was swayed away from Palestinians and toward the Israelis. After reading the context around this poll, it should be very obvious that the public opinion shift was part of the plan all along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jeez. This kind of conspiracy b.s. gives us all a bad name. The kamikaze hijacking attacks of 9/11/01 were precisely what caused the buildings to collapse. I&#39;m not even going to use OPs silly four elements. I&#39;m going to tell you exactly why jet fuel can melt steel.</p>

<p>Has anyone ever used a chimney charcoal starter? You put charcoal in a metal tube on a grate, and under that grate you wad up paper. You simply light the paper and the heat from that tiny fire ignites the charcoal. The same thing happened in those towers! That heat got concentrated in a vent and that produced some very high temperatures. Add in the terrible fire retardant foam insulation that shook or melted off and the all around iffy design of the buildings, you have disaster.</p>

<p>Occam&#39;s razor people. All facts, all science point to exactly what happened.</p>

<p>Now, if you want to talk about the U.S. Govt. working with Al-Qeada to facilitate this attack in order to ramp up the domestic control by stripping away liberties, militarizing the police and conducting sweeping surveillance that serves the wealthiest in the new world state-government Conspiracy, well ...</p>

Again, these false conspiracies you&#39;ve been conned into are steering you away from the real truth. The one thing you have right is 9/11/01 was a Conspiracy, but it was our government working with the terrorists and allowing this to happen. By all evidence our government knew the plan was in place. Certain key figures and important people were notified beforehand. And the CIA and DEA had a long friendship with Bin Laden. He got what he wanted, the corporate-government masters got what they wanted and our freedom has never been the same since. THAT&#39;S your 9/11/01 Conspiracy.</p>

<p>you are willing to believe that the government will exploit a bad situation but not be a part of it in the first place?</p>

<p>The WTC buildings have had terrorist attacks before but nothing came of it... they knew they needed to fully demolish these buildings to get the country behind them... so how could they not be involved in every step of the way? </p>

<p>I use &quot;they&quot; not necessarily meaning the US Govt. I have no clue who the exact people are... but Dick Cheney did call off taking down the plane that hit the pentagon... so he&#39;s involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an interesting perspective. Don&#39;t you think they might have made arrangements for controlled demolitions as a backup, because you can simulate everything else accurately in that scenario beforehand except the collapsing part. The &quot;planners&quot; could not have been 100% sure the buildings would collapse from the crash as they were specifically designed to withstand a jumbojet crashing into it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>40 minutes ... about the time the towers took isn&#39;t it? Interesting. Yes, heat travels up, thus the melted steel. There&#39;s a fantastic PBS Nova special on all of this, which I am sure you all deny as liberal media lies from ( enter nutjob right-wing idiot theory here ). But when engineers that built the building, scientists, more engineers and scientists and even MORE engineers and scientists, state their facts and conclusions without adding theory and conjecture, I&#39;ll trust their findings over those of talk radio blowhards. Too bad you folks can&#39;t see you&#39;ve been hoodwinked by the Conspiracy itself into looking for fake conspiracies. As your busy fileting this red herring their sharks are eating your few remaining rights. But hey, I&#39;m not Glenn Beck or Alex Jones or any number of loud abrasive jackasses who have a flock of sheep to fleece. None of you have listened to me yet, none of you will now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>tower 7 - documented evidence it was a controlled demolition done to preserve rescue and recovery efforts. look it up. Building evacuated and they used equipment from the area to pull out it&#39;s main supports.</p>

<p>Aluminum studs in the wall and light gauge steel members, will melt in a fire. If it&#39;s also galvanized, it will burn green. Cool as hell.</p>

<p>thermite residue or residue similar in composition to thermite? Two different things. Lots of old crap and materials laying around inside high rise buildings. I know because I work on crews that built a few. Lots of it toxic, like asbestos, will stay around and never be removed due to saturating air intake systems with dangerous particulates.</p>

<p>Melted concrete? WTF is wrong with you, that stuff does not melt. It turns into a powder, you add water, and it&#39;s concrete again.</p>

<p>Jump off a skyscraper, or survive one collapse. Or survive a giant airplane smashing into one with you in it. Lets see if you don&#39;t vaporize into meaty chunks upon that sudden impact.</p>

<p>When iron workers, and steel framers erect buildings they make all kinds of cuts, modify members, even retrofitting because they get the wrong pieces and it is too expensive to ship back. Along with an airplane cutting a building in half, that is designed to collapse within itself so it does not topple over and smash other buildings, one of the buildings did which is what damaged WTC 7, It is not surprising there are pieces cut at 45 degree angles.</p>

<p>You are too focused on how it happened. Not why it was allowed to happen. Follow the money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well. I wouldn&#39;t immediately put that point away. Knowing the WTC complex was a choice target for terrorism (according to the FBI anyway) as well as the presence of various high profile agencies in WTC7 itself. Knowing it was built during the Cold War frenzy. Knowing New-York is a coastal city, hence a possible bridge head (?) for an enemy invasion. etc. I feel real fucking confident believing pre-rigging the buildings for demolition (as they were getting built) is a thing the cold warriors have at least considered. <em>Better blow it all up than let them commies get a chance of stuffing their noses in our stuff!! etc</em></p>

<p>OK! Just saying.</p>

<p>considering that the FBI effectively bombed the WTC themselves in 1993, they supplied the bomb maker and materials to the morons that wanted to, those people had no technical ability to build a bomb, so the FBI supplied them with an ex Egyptian army technical expert. an FBI asset.</p>

<p>all got revealed by journalists doing FOIA on the FBI, the telephone conversations (&quot;give me more money or I <em>lose</em> the bomb&quot;) between the NY FBI and the bomb builder are on the internet of you can be bothered to google for it.</p>

If this were true, one nutjob building administrator or janitor would have had a bad day with his wife, and chose to commit murder/suicide in the grandest of fashion.  Also, killing your fantasy theory, explosives DO NOT last forever, and must be regularly inspected and maintained.  You cant pack them away in steel I-beams for 45 years, then hope to God they work when to need them.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s clear that you can see conventional explosives were used to bring all three towers down.  Now what is challenging you is that to have explosives used, they would have to have been pre-planted by someone.  Airplanes and simple office fires DO NOT cause over-engineered skyscrapers to collapse.</p>

<p>tower 7 - documented evidence it was a controlled demolition done to preserve rescue and recovery efforts. look it up. Building evacuated and they used equipment from the area to pull out it&#39;s main supports.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was pre-knowledge of WTC7 coming down. Firefighters did clear the area before it came down... but they could not have &quot;used eqipment from the area&quot; to simultaneously cut all of the support columns (within miliseconds of eachother) in the given time they had from the first attack to before it came down. The question is... Who told the firefighters to clear the area as they knew it was about to come down because small office fires on a small amount of floors would not constitute demolishing the entire building the way it was.</p>

<p>Aluminum studs in the wall and light gauge steel members, will melt in a fire. If it&#39;s also galvanized, it will burn green. Cool as hell.</p>

<p>Aluminium needs 1200F of heat to weaken and melt. The way the building fell in a symmetrical fashion and at free-fall speed again does not leave many options as to how it came down.</p>

<p>Molten (not melted) Concrete is a real thing. There is photographic evidence of huge molten concrete chunks found in the rubble.</p>

<p>The theory says that a structural failure due to fires caused the top section to drop one floor, which set off a chain reaction that completely demolished the buildings.

<p>when concrete sets its a one way process, a chemical process.</p>

<p>you can use clean concrete as aggregate, but chemically its done for as cement. </p>

<p>folded steel studs, nobody uses aluminum for studding/structure apart from plane makers.</p>

<p>and aluminum is anodized not galvanized. theres a subtle difference in the process, one a cubicle warrior quoting from TLA talking points would not understand. comprehend before quoting BS.</p>
