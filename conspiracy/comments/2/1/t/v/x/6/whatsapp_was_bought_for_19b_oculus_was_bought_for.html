<p>At the same time, Bill Gates makes money on the side by selling skype metadata to the NSA etc. Then he asks for tax breaks so that he keeps paying wages to people instead of replacing them with robots.</p>

<p>Just because they have so many users doesn&#39;t mean all those users still use the system.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re missing the point. $2 Billion vs $19 Billion is insane and shows how much value personal info is worth to businesses. Whatsapp isn&#39;t ground breaking technology, facebook bought a user base.</p>

<p>Well I doubt that.  To me it just seems that current VR is more of a novelty at this point.  I really don&#39;t think it will become widely popular until our technology can give us VR that is visually very close to reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that Facebook has to buy users because they can&#39;t innovate anymore to attract new users themselves is a pretty good indication of the state Facebook is in. It&#39;s just a matter of time before they become the new MySpace and the social networking bubble bursts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, I don&#39;t think it will become Myspace because their data strategy is phenomenal. They have active users today because of this, in my opinion. What I am getting at is every interaction you have on Facebook is stored and that data is used to modify what ads you see, which of your friends pops up in your news feed, and things of that nature. On the flipside though, people are beginning to realize that Facebook is a source of misery and jealousy (anyone in their early to mid 20s will tell you this) ..its a circle jerk of people bragging about their lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason I think that is Facebook fails to innovate anymore and they have to fall back on their data strategy to stay profitable. The problem is the more they push the data mining the more users they drive away who are fed up with it, which means less data to mine. I just don&#39;t see this model succeeding longterm. I think it&#39;s just a matter of time before someone comes up with a more innovative social platform. Facebook killed MySpace, reddit killed Digg and I think the same thing will eventually happen to Facebook.</p>
