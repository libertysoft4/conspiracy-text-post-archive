<p>LESLIE ROBERTSON: I think the structures were stalwart but they were not that stalwart. There was no fire suppression system that could even begin to deal with that, with that event, nothing, nothing, so I, I, I didn&#39;t know whether they would fall or not fall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Odd that someone so knowledgeable wouldn&#39;t have known that fire cannot bring down a steel building.  Or perhaps fire, in fact, can lead to collapse of large structures? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>LESLIE ROBERTSON: We had designed the project for the impact of the, our largest aeroplane of its time, the, the Boeing 707. That is to take this jet aeroplane, run it into the building, destroy a lot of structure and still have it stand up.</p>

<p>With the 707, to the best of my knowledge, the fuel load was not considered in the design and indeed I don&#39;t know how it could have been considered.</p>

<p>We had designed the project for the impact of the largest airplane of its time, the Boeing 707. The 767 that actually hit the WTC was quite another matter again. First of all it was a bit heavier than the 707, not very much heavier, but a bit heavier. But mostly it was flying a lot faster. And the energy that it put into the building is proportional to its square of the velocity, as you double the velocity, four times the energy. Triple the velocity, eight times the energy [sic - nine times] and so forth.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Note: as Robertson eluded, the kinetic energy the 767 put into the WTC was roughly 25 times the energy a 707 would have brought, since the 707 as studied would have been a landing craft, not one going 545 miles per hour.]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But, and with the 767 the fuel load was enormous compared to that of the 707, it was a fully fuelled airplane compared to the 707 which was a landing aircraft. Just absolutely no comparison between the two.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So even to Robertson, the idea of a lost 707 hitting the building and the much heavier and near cruise speed 767 hitting the buildings aren&#39;t even comparable.  </p>

That is if you subscribe to the fringe theory known as &quot;physics.&quot; Not a pile of microscopic, HE pulverized concrete AND pulverized STEEL.  The same steel that was formerly heavily reinforcing the concrete massive shafts.  Ones than could easily keep the towers standing on their own.</p>

<p>Comparing the upper portion, roughly 30 lighter floors, with the lower  undamaged and stouter  floors  there was no physical way the collapses should have happened that way.</p>

<p>The top floors began tipping over but miraculously stopped tipping and fell directly straight down defying the conservation of momentum under the explanation we are expected to buy  but that  is entirely consistent with a demolition.</p>

<p>This did not resemble a gravity fed collapse. </p>

<p>The upper portion fell in the direction of most resistance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely.  I would love to have this open and honest debate with you regarding the readily apparent heavily flawed physics used in the laughably incorrect NIST and 9/11 Commission reports.  When the upper portion of the building came crashing down, how b ch energy would it have to pulverized the floors below it.  We must get one item out if the way first.  Even though the officials have stated the &quot;pancake collapse&quot; their is incorrect, many foolish people still believe it.  Now back to the upper portion pulverizing everything below it, frequently at freefall speeds.  Indicating ZERO structural support.</p>

<p>The weight of the upper portion of the building could only affect the number of floors equal to its own size.  Anything more than this is simply not possible.  As we saw the upper portion break away and come crashing down, it would have only affected the sane number of floors.  And thanks to the undamaged supports below the impact zone, this piece of the top of the building would have simply fell downward, then off the side of the towers.  Not all the way down, often at freefall, collapsing perfectly into its own footprint THREE times that day.  Never before or since has anything of the sort EVER occurred </p>

<p>Here is a good article that explains entirely how the fantasy that is the 9/11 Commission report is absolutely flawed and incorrect - <a href="http://infoalternativas.blogspot.com/2013/04/what-newton-has-to-say-about-collapse.html">http://infoalternativas.blogspot.com/2013/04/what-newton-has-to-say-about-collapse.html</a></p>

Even more damaged than Building 7, yet completely unlike this anomalous perfect collapse after simple office fires, she remained standing.  As would be expected, and what should have happened with 1, 2, and 7.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Frank Demartino was a manager, not an engineer</p>

<p>There were no design &quot;tests&quot; of the crash scenario (what does this even mean).  In fact, there are no records at all of the parameters and values used to determine the design response to a 707 impact. </p>

<p>Your link also intentionally garbles the facts.  The belief was that a lost 707 (low on fuel) might hit the tower.  Single impact.  Low speed.  What happened was not even close to that scenario.  Fire was never factored.  Core damage was not factored. This is confirmed by Robertson himself.  Who is alive and oddly for someone so intimate with the buildings and a reputable structural engineer has no problems with the physics of the collapse.  </p>

<p>Skilling&#39;s quote about over design is always (surprise!) cherry picked because he talks specifically about loss of perimeter columns.  Read that again.  Only loss of perimeter columns.  Not core damage. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like many modern structures and buildings, the WTC Towers were over-designed to withstand weight distribution in the event of structural damage.  According to calculations made by the engineers who helped with the design of the Twin Towers, “<strong>all the columns on one side of a Tower could be cut, as well as the two corners and some of the columns on each adjacent side, and the building would still be strong enough to withstand a 100-mile-per-hour wind</strong>.”[5] As well, “<strong>Live loads on these columns can be increased more than 2,000% before failure occurs</strong>.”[6]</p>
