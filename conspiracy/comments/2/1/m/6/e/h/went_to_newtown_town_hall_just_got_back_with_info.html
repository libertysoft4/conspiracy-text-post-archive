        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Edit: For anyone who&#39;s wondering here&#39;s the <a href="http://imgur.com/ikSDvin">sign next to the computer I was using</a></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/8pVSetV">The front of the Town Hall before I went in</a></p>

<p>Example of <a href="http://imgur.com/dEs1sOy">a picture I took of the computer screen before the Clerks started walking around and I felt too guilty to keep doing it, it was the wrong thing to do since they want you to pay for printing</a></p>

<p>To find the facts about the ongoing speculation about the sale dates/prices and realty in Sandy Hook, I just spent some time at the Newtown Town Hall going through public records.</p>

<p>I found a lot of interesting information that I will review and compile so that it makes a cogent argument for the points it shows, but that will take me several days. </p>

<p>What I can tell you is that the online 12/25/2009 $0 sale dates have nothing to do with people getting &quot;free homes&quot;. All of those homes have other sale dates and amounts either before 12/25/2009, or since, some are &quot;quit claimed&quot; for $1, yes, but none on 12/25/2009 (town offices are closed anyway). </p>

<p>However, it also does not appear to be, in my assessment of this, a computer glitch either. </p>

<ul>
<li>It appears on two websites whose servers do not &quot;talk&quot; to each other. </li>
</ul>

<p>-<a href="http://maps.newtown-ct.gov/">http://maps.newtown-ct.gov/</a> 
-<a href="http://data.visionappraisal.com/NewtownCT/findpid.asp?iTable=pid&amp;pid=372">http://data.visionappraisal.com/NewtownCT/findpid.asp?iTable=pid&amp;pid=372</a></p>

<p>Both sites have the same dates, so maybe one site used the other for data and the first really was a glitch (though next I&#39;ll tell you why I don&#39;t think it is likely), or both sites were compromised by the same source who entered those dates.</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#39;d have to look closer and spend several days in the town clerk&#39;s office to understand this issue, and have someone who understands real estate with me. To print anything at the Newtown Town Hall it was $1.00 <em>per page</em>, so that wasn&#39;t happening. I was sitting there writing fast and furiously, but it was very overwhelming to do it this way- I could barely make a dent in all of the records I wanted to view, so I&#39;ll have to come up with another strategy and go back. Also, though reading public records is legal, of course, that is why they are there, for the public, I also didn&#39;t want to cause a stir in a town whose offices and population has been trampled upon, so I wanted to make myself scarce. So, none of the &quot;12/25/2009&quot; $0 sale homes are listed that way in the actual town records. However, there is no rhyme of reason as to why THOSE are the properties listed that way online because it isn&#39;t as if the 12/25/2009 &quot;fills in&quot; an online listing when one hasn&#39;t been entered. (eg. 3/9/2002 $370,900   and then 12/25/2009 $0)   12/25/09 isn&#39;t just filling empty entries. </li>
</ul>

<p>I think the 12/25/2009 entries are some method by which someone wanted to protect the information of real estate in town. It seems that most of the property with those dates has not had any transactions occur since... So while it is not accurate information at all, (fact) I do not think it is &quot;just a glitch&quot; (speculation). </p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m curious how one would justify downvoting this post. It is factual, it is based on first hand research, it is not an opinion to disagree with, or a wild speculation, and it is just the truth, which serves both the conspiracy, and the conspiritard community. Isn&#39;t the truth what we all want? I don&#39;t get it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re welcome. Why continue speculating if someone can go get the data first hand? There is enough out there on many topics, not just this one, that we <em>don&#39;t</em> have access to, so when possible, I try to get to the source and eliminate the need for speculation. We can all do our part. :)   </p>

<p>I&#39;ll be putting out more as I organize it on some other issues I came across, but I think this helps a bit on a topic that was causing a lot of derision in the &quot;conspiracy&quot; and &quot;debunker&quot; communities alike. </p>

<p>Yeah I think a huge number of apparent conflicts that come up regarding these situations come from the fact that we&#39;re all working with imperfect data. The closer we can get to the source data the more clear the picture becomes.</p>

They are either a shill or wish to remain blind because obvserving the facts is too difficulty to for some to cope with emotionally since the topic is in direct relation to the potential murder of children. Even if it people feel uncomfortable that does not mean things should not be adequately investigated, and in my opinion it only justifies further investigation.</p>

I often use the same technique, if I am missing info, I&#39;ll use a date, etc that is out of the realm of possible transactions as a substitute so that I do not have blank fields.

<p>However, there is no rhyme of reason as to why THOSE are the properties listed that way online because it isn&#39;t as if the 12/25/2009 &quot;fills in&quot; an online listing when one hasn&#39;t been entered. (eg. 3/9/2002 $370,900 and then 12/25/2009 $0) 12/25/09 isn&#39;t just filling empty entries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But there are hundreds of 12/25/2009 $0 entries where there were already existing data entries. </p>

<p>You see what I mean?</p>

<p>There is no (obvious) commonality between the addresses that have this. </p>

<p>Eg. 
4/1/1998 $278,000
9/20/2004 $209,000
12/25/2009 $0 </p>

<p>Or, some who just have 12/25/2009. </p>

<p>Or, some who do NOT have 12/25/2009. </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t &#39;filler&#39; data since it is posted on records that did not need filling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could be that.</p>

<p>It could be database/computer error.</p>

<p>It could be something else. The Town Clerk doesn&#39;t have any control over the companies who enter the data into their websites posting public records online, so my next step will be to go to them for more information and figure out how the glitch occurred, why, was it just an error. It is NOT data filler though. It is not only on the records that were &#39;missing entries&#39;.  It is on some of those, yes. But it also appears on some entries with several records preceding it that did NOT need filler. I&#39;m not speculating. I&#39;m just posting facts as I find them, from the source. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I&#39;m not trying to upset people or spout theories that disrespect people without trying to obtain truth from the source. Like I wrote in the past, this post- actually- could have just as easily been posted to <a href="/r/conspiritard">/r/conspiritard</a> with the heading &quot;Found on the speculation about the 12/25/2009 real estate being &#39;gifted&#39; homes is false.&quot;  </p>

<p>INTERESTINGLY, and contrary to what people have said here about me-  I never, ever posted about, speculated about, or thought that these homes were &quot;free gifts/payoffs&quot;-  Not once.  </p>

<p>I posted to FACTS about what the website said, and people assumed that was my supposition.  It wasn&#39;t at all. I never thought that anyone was getting payoffs or free homes. I was just reporting facts.</p>

<p>Thanks for being level headed. </p>

<p>I have a lot of friends who have beliefs that I don&#39;t agree with, and vice versa. It doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t kindly get along, in fact, it keeps conversations interesting, and when we discuss things civilly I find we often learn the most.</p>
