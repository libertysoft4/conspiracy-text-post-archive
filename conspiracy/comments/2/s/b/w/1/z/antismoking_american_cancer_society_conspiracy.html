        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For awhile I&#39;ve been dubious of all the anti smoking stuff. </p>

<p>When I was a little kid a lot of changing rooms had ash trays and you could still smoke in restaurants. Besides walking past smokers when entering a building and being asked smoking or not smoking at a restaurant, I really didn&#39;t think about smoking.\</p>

<p>Now I can&#39;t move 2 feet without seeing a no smoking sign. The bathrooms at the mall and at school have little card holders with pamphlets on quitting smoking. Posters of the dangers of smoking are on all the cork boards. Everywhere has signs saying that I can breath easy because they are proudly a smoke free environment.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t watched TV in years but when I was a teen every other commercial was a Truth anti smoking commercial. Their ADs also filled my skateboarding and video game magazines. I remember multiple times when I would be looking up reviews for a movie I just saw and would see there was outrage  over a character smoking. If it wasn&#39;t for the complaints I wouldn&#39;t even have noticed or remembered. </p>

<p>I think about cigarets and smoking more than ever. Seeing all this anti smoking stuff made me wonder why people still smoke and started smoking. Was it really that enjoyable it was worth the cancer risk? Then every time I read the news something else has been discovered to cause cancer. I hear how smoking rates have gone down, but then I hear cancer rates are higher than ever. </p>

<p>I wanted to find out the facts and I&#39;ve found it&#39;s really hard to get accurate data on cancer deaths from smoking because there are guidelines issued by the American Cancer Society, that when a person dies of certain conditions and has ever admitted to smoking, the doctor has to list the death as &quot;due to smoking&quot;.</p>

<p>Turns out the American Cancer Society in general is just very shady.</p>

<p>They have been involved in non consensual human experimentation for decades.</p>

<p>In 1963, 22 elderly patients at the Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital in Brooklyn, New York were injected with live cancer cells by Chester M. Southam, who in 1952 had done the same to prisoners at the Ohio State Prison, in order to &quot;discover the secret of how healthy bodies fight the invasion of malignant cells&quot;. The administration of the hospital attempted to cover the study up, but the New York medical licensing board ultimately placed Southam on probation for one year. Two years later, the American Cancer Society elected him as their Vice President.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#1960s">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#1960s</a></p>

<p>There is a quota of smoking caused deaths that have to happen to get funding.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had few family members die from cancer. Everything I associated that&#39;s horrible about having cancer is actually from the &quot;treatment&quot; of cancer. A couple years ago my uncle was at a very low point and the doctors said there wasn&#39;t anything more they could do. He started smoking weed and was feeling a lot better and seemed to be getting healthier. The cancer was going away but some part of the &quot;treatment&quot; had destroyed his veins that&#39;s what ended up killing him.</p>

<p>When you look at stats for rate of smokers and compare it to average life expectancy it turns out that a high rate of smokers translates, in many cases, to long life expectancy and low rates of lung cancer. For males, in 1994, the country with the highest life expectancy (76.6 years) was Iceland, where 31% of the men smoked. The next runner-up was Japan, where 59% of the men smoked, and life expectancy was 76.5 years. Other countries with high rates of male smoking and long life expectancies included Israel (45%, 75.9 years); Greece (46%, 75.2 years); Cuba (49.3%, 74.7 years) and Spain (48%, 74.5 years).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve just begun to look into this. Maybe you guys know more. I would like to hear everyone else&#39;s knowledge and opinions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember that cancer is random, smoking increases the chances of getting some cancers but you can still get it but never smoke in your life or smoke 20 a day from 20 to 80 and not get (though there would be other effects). </p>

<p>Some treatments are designed for giving people a bit longer life expectantcy, if they think they will not get better, though it sucks what happened to your Uncle :(</p>

<p>As for why people do it still even though they know the risks that is the same for most things, hardcore drugs, alchohol, people always think that they won&#39;t be affected and people generally start smoking in their teen years (same for drugs and drink) as it is seen as &#39;cool&#39; </p>

<p>If you want to find out more about smoking related cancer deaths try some other countries&#39; cancer societies, Britain I would imagine to be good, they have a big presence here and we have the NHS</p>

<p>Also did you know that the first research to prove smoking was bad for your lungs and health were nazi scientists, hitler didnt smoke or drink and was a vegetarian interestingly enough</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im currently trying to quit smoking. So thanks for reminding me. (Haha)</p>

<p>Uhm, yea ive always been suspicious of these points you have. I mean, there <strong>IS</strong> a mountain of evidence that smoking can cause cancer. Thats not something im going to debate right now.</p>

<p>But, as far as cancer <em>TREATMENT</em>, well, ive always been suspicious of the cancer treatments. Like you said, a lot of folks die from the treatment itself, not the cancer. Plus, whenever you have an incredibly lucrative business founded on the people most in need, and it makes you a billionare, im gonna be highly suspicious. Cancer has become a business nowadays...</p>

<p>Plus, you hear about all these &quot;natural&quot; treatments, like weed, which have some very convincing evidence that they can treat cancer better, faster, more efficiently, and more safely, than chemo. And then you hear that these things are illegal because of an unconstitutional war on drugs, and other highlybsuspect pieces of legislation and politcal roundabouts, where all parties opposed to the naturals make a shit ton of money, and i get super suspicious, critical, and bitter. There is definately something being squandered by the dollar signs in their eyes. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, itll be hard to know for sure because of the political stranglehold around our populace&#39;s necks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just remember – cigarettes are far easier to quit than they make them out to be.</p>

<p>WARNING – CIGARETTES ARE HIGHLY ADDICTIVE</p>

<p><em>there is no way you&#39;re going to give them up, so don&#39;t even try</em></p>

<p>Honestly, it mostly just comes down to whether, deep inside your psyche, you really want to quit them. If you do, just go cold turkey, throw away your last pack and don&#39;t buy any more. Then monitor your physiological state as you withdraw.</p>

<p>&quot;Am I feeling so bad right now?&quot;</p>

<p>The answer is never yes. It&#39;s psychosomatic! You expect cravings, so you feel them. If you believe that cigarettes aren&#39;t actually addictive, you realise that the unusual feeling of quitting is just breaking a habit, like, stopping biting your fingernails or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My grandma said she quit the moment she got pregnant. It wasn&#39;t hard she just did it and she smoked for decades. It&#39;s been about 45 years and she said old movies still make her want one, that it made coffee better, and sometimes she think it would be nice to have a smoke every now and then.  She has no plans of ever being a smoker again.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never considered myself a smoker, but I&#39;ve smoked before. When I was a teen my friends would steal them from their parents or have older siblings buy. The first time I smoked too fast and got nauseous. Then I learned to slow down and enjoy it. I would smoke every now and then at a party, camping, or if we took a trip to the beach for a weekend. When I first started going to college I started dating a smoker. That next summer was the closest I&#39;ve ever came to being a smoker. I smoked about 5 cigs everyday for about 3 months. We broke up. I didn&#39;t even think about smoking for a couple years then I was out with a friend I hadn&#39;t seen in years who smokes I had a couple with him. </p>

<p>I have a learning disability called dysgraphia, a few months ago I was talking to someone else with it and they said nicotine helps them and they smoke before writing essays and during finals. I looked it up and other have found this out too. I tried it and it did actually seem to help. Then my campus went tobacco free and now everyone vapes. During finals I got an e cig and used it a lot. I consumed way more nicotine then I ever did before with real cigs. When I stopped after the semester was over I did experience some withdrawal. Since you can do it inside I had started doing it when I first woke up since Im really not a morning person and it&#39;s a stimulant. The first day I stopped the first thing I thought of when waking up was to vape. No intense cravings. First day went fine didn&#39;t even think about it. About 48 hours of not doing it I felt cravings and some stomach cramps. I began to feel really restless. The next day it was less severe, wasn&#39;t that bad to begin with I could easily distract myself. The day after that I was 100% fine. </p>

<p>I used to abuse pain pills, I also found the addiction to that over exaggerated. The chemical addiction wasn&#39;t the problem it was how much I enjoyed it and used it to escape shit that was going on in my life. The worst part about it was the constipation. I got a fissure from it.... A place near me sells sweet potato waffle fries, my cravings for those are stronger than anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I almost began arguing with you about how addictive itbis and how hard it is to quit. Almost. But then i realized what you wete saying. </p>

<p>Ive tried quitting dozens of times. Mainly because my wife absolutely hates it. It was the hardest thing to do, and onky ever lasted a few days.</p>

<p>Then one night my friend and i had a bonfire like the good ol days with a case of beer and some cigs, and we both decided, out of nowhere that that was the last night we were gonna smoke. </p>

<p>This time i quit for myself, because <strong><em>I</em></strong> wanted to. And its been almost a month now, and its never been this easy before. So you make a valid point in the fact that you first have to <em>want</em> to quit... Otherwise you are lying to yourself and setting yourself up for failure. </p>

<p>However, withdrawal is a motherfucker, and they psychological effects were profound in the beginning two weeks. Now, not so bad. So the addiction thing, thats pretty legit, imo and in my experience...</p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT</em></strong> you also make a good point about the psychosomatic aspect of it...</p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT 2</em></strong> have you ever smoked and tried to quit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I had been trying to quit for ages, trying to cut down the number I was having each day in the hope that one day it would be zero, using nicotine gum and inhalers, etc.</p>

<p>No luck. Well, I did cut down, but it was a constant battle, and when my willpower wavered I was back up to my normal rate feeling guilty.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I read on the stop smoking subreddit that people had been having luck with a book called &quot;Allen Carr&#39;s Easy Way to Stop Smoking&quot;. I got hold of it and started reading. In the first few pages, he guarantees that by the end of the book you&#39;ll simply <em>stop smoking</em>. It also mentioned that nicotine is far less addictive than it&#39;s made out to be.</p>

<p>At that point, I thought &quot;why do I have to read this book to stop smoking if it&#39;s mostly psychological and nicotine isn&#39;t that addictive anyway?&quot; and I stopped right then.</p>

<p>In the following days, determined to see if the withdrawal really wasn&#39;t anything at all, I monitored my state, and really, it was never that bad. That&#39;s when it occurred to me that we&#39;re being lied to about cigarettes. They are a little bit addictive, but compared to drugs that are <em>actually</em> addictive, it doesn&#39;t compare.</p>

<p>So, I quit smoking for about 6 months. I was going well, but then the stresses of my life saw me smoking joints pretty regularly, which I would put &quot;just a bit&quot; of tobacco in. After a few weeks, I realised I was craving tobacco again and caved. I don&#39;t mind though, because I know it&#39;s easy to quit. Soon as I catch a break from my current vicissitudes I&#39;ll do it again, and it&#39;ll be easy again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol sorry
Do you vape? I know a lot of redditors say it helped them quit. </p>

<p>There is a mountain of evidence, but I don&#39;t trust that evidence. If there are guidelines issued by the American Cancer Society, that when a person dies of certain conditions and has ever admitted to smoking, the doctor has to list the death as &quot;due to smoking&quot;. I&#39;m sure there are many similar guidelines when smoking and cancer research is done. </p>

<p>All the stuff in cigarettes aren&#39;t unique to cigarette and can be found in carpets, furniture, burning wood or even foods in the kitchen, exhaust from vehicles, and other stuff.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s the winter I have a fireplace, my neighbors have fire places. The whole neighborhood smells like smoke. When I&#39;m out shoveling snow I have all the SUVs runnings and blowing exhaust everywhere. My aunt claims all the chemicals in her mattress gave her cancer, she never smoked. Apparently they are made with a ton of cancer causing chemicals. She said sleeping on these mattresses was like smoking 2 packs a day. My mom came over, stripped my bed, and set it outside to air out the chemicals. I joke that she probably just added some cancer causing pollution to the mix.</p>

<p>I heard there is some sort of controversy surrounding fire retardants too. I downloaded a documentary. Gonna go watch it. </p>

<p>Cancer treatment seems very much lets see what kills you first the treatment or the cancer and maybe we will be lucky and most of the damage we cause your body will be to the cancer cells then you can be cancer free. </p>

<p>When you get carcinogens on your skin, it might increase your risk of cancer, as you body can absorb bad shit through the skin. But when we smoke, that shit goes straight into your lungs and directly into your bloodstream. Sure, when we breathe in polluted air we will do the same.

    <div class="md"><p>I think when stuff is absorbed through the skin then it goes to the bloodstream too. Isn&#39;t that how nicotine patches work?</p>

<p>I know smoking has legit health risks, but I think they are greatly exaggerated. I&#39;ve read anti smoking stuff that talked about 3rd hand smoke. An example of 3rd hand smoke is being able to smell smoke on someones jacket. Apparently 3rd hand smoke can cause cancer. I read an article in a magazine at dentist that said 3rd hand smoke was the leading cost of sudden infant death syndrome.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see this type of propaganda for anything else. </p>

<p>Wood smoke is so much worse for you, yet every home in my nice suburban  development has a fireplace. The first saturday of every month is burn day, where everyone burns sticks and leaves. </p>

<p>When this is so much worse for you than cigarettes.

<p>Yet at the eco friendly green park there are signs like this.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/mLq7zIi.jpg">Imgur</a></p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/0TWyLCw.jpg">Imgur</a></p>

<p>Yet when I step outside all I smell are fireplaces and people burning various stuff in their yard.</p>

<p>I think we are constantly surrounded by cancer causing stuff and it&#39;s pinned on smoking. </p>

<p>I think we agree on the big things, (like 3rd hand smoke is a silly notion). But the details is where we differ, i think.</p>

<p>The nicotine patches do get absorbed through the skin, as many other chemicals do. But the difference is speed of absorption. Patches take a few minutes to kick in, while smoking takes about two or three seconds.</p>

<p>As for the constiuent chemicals in wood smoke vs cigarette smoke, i cannot say which is worse because i dont know. But, even when yiu are at a bonfire, you arent direct inhaling pure smoke (unless the wind blows in the right direction) like you do when you smoke cigarettes. And, not as often. Thats all im saying. Im not discreditting your points, just making the claim that smoking cigarettes causes more direct damage more often and allkws for the carcinogens to be absorbed much faster and more efficiently. </p>

<p>But i think you hit the nail on the head with the exaggeration part. I meam third hand smoke? This is the first ive heard of that actually...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree 100%.</p>

<p>I posted this bellow, but I will repost it here to be sure you see it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never considered myself a smoker, but I&#39;ve smoked before. When I was a teen my friends would steal them from their parents or have older siblings buy. The first time I smoked too fast and got nauseous. Then I learned to slow down and enjoy it. I would smoke every now and then at a party, camping, or if we took a trip to the beach for a weekend. When I first started going to college I started dating a smoker. That next summer was the closest I&#39;ve ever came to being a smoker. I smoked about 5 cigs everyday for about 3 months. We broke up. I didn&#39;t even think about smoking for a couple years then I was out with a friend I hadn&#39;t seen in years who smokes I had a couple with him. </p>

<p>I started going back to school a year ago and I have a learning disability called dysgraphia, a few months ago I was talking to someone else with it and they said nicotine helps them and they smoke before writing essays and during finals. I looked it up and other have found this out too. I tried it and it did actually seem to help. Then my campus went tobacco free and now everyone vapes. During finals I got an e cig and used it a lot. I consumed way more nicotine then I ever did before with real cigs. When I stopped after the semester was over I did experience some withdrawal. Since you can do it inside I had started doing it when I first woke up since Im really not a morning person and it&#39;s a stimulant. The first day I stopped the first thing I thought of when waking up was to vape. No intense cravings. First day went fine didn&#39;t even think about it. About 48 hours of not doing it I felt cravings and some stomach cramps. I began to feel really restless. The next day it was less severe, wasn&#39;t that bad to begin with I could easily distract myself. The day after that I was 100% fine. </p>

<p>I used to abuse pain pills, I also found the addiction to that over exaggerated. The chemical addiction wasn&#39;t the problem it was how much I enjoyed it and used it to escape shit that was going on in my life. The worst part about it was the constipation. I got a fissure from it.... A place near me sells sweet potato waffle fries, my cravings for those are stronger than anything. </p>

<p>I think I remember if you look at a map of lung cancer rates in the US and compare it to population density it lines up quite nicely (the implication being that living on the east coast is more strongly associated with lung cancer than smoking....)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the stats on disease are also bias. 70% of lung cancers are in nonsmokers. Well then 70% of smokers who have cancer may indeed have got cancer from other means...gasoline is highly carcinogenic. Yet if you smoke and get cancer it is 100% the smoking that did it.

    <div class="md"><p>interesting, haven&#39;t heard that before &amp; there could be some truth to it, <del>one can only guess how much money</del> they&#39;re making enough money,</p>

<p>maybe cigarettes <em>were made</em> the scapegoat (when people start to get sick, they had to come up with an answer) - besides diet which some people say is culprit, i would guess that the men in other countries have a healthier diet, </p>

<p>also the changes to food (preservatives, GMO, etc), chemicals in water, cell phones, wifi, stress, (i&#39;m gonna throw in chemtrails because i believe they are adding chemicals to the air), i&#39;ve no doubt cosmetics is suspect too, and i know that mammograms aren&#39;t needed as often <em>now</em>,</p>

<p>edit: if smoking isn&#39;t the cause of cancer; <em>something</em> is-- Probably PESTICIDES</p>

<p>also consider:</p>

<p>Published: July 9, 1987</p>

<p>ALBANY, July 8— A study issued today by the New York State Health Department says <em>that children with leukemia or brain cancer are more likely than healthy children to be living in homes where the exposure to the magnetic fields generated by electric power lines is high.</em></p>

<p>In addition to the higher incidence of childhood cancer, the study suggests that exposure to a magnetic field causes behavorial changes in laboratory animals.</p>

<p>Researchers were quick to note that they could not explain the higher incidence of cancer and that the study did not establish a direct cause-and-effect link. Other variables not measured by the study could be factors in the development of cancer, for which the incidence among children is 1 in 10,000 each year.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/09/nyregion/study-cites-incidence-of-cancer-near-power-lines.html">http://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/09/nyregion/study-cites-incidence-of-cancer-near-power-lines.html</a></p>

<p>it would be good if someone could do a study, about this in the US (yeah, good luck with that), there is too much money to be made off illness, can&#39;t have people living to a healthy old age.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol sorry
Do you vape? I know a lot of redditors say it helped them quit. </p>

<p>There is a mountain of evidence, but I don&#39;t trust that evidence. If there are guidelines issued by the American Cancer Society, that when a person dies of certain conditions and has ever admitted to smoking, the doctor has to list the death as &quot;due to smoking&quot;. I&#39;m sure there are many similar guidelines when smoking and cancer research is done. </p>

<p>All the stuff in cigarettes aren&#39;t unique to cigarette and can be found in carpets, furniture, burning wood or even foods in the kitchen, exhaust from vehicles, and other stuff.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s the winter I have a fireplace, my neighbors have fire places. The whole neighborhood smells like smoke. When I&#39;m out shoveling snow I have all the SUVs runnings and blowing exhaust everywhere. My aunt claims all the chemicals in her mattress gave her cancer, she never smoked. Apparently they are made with a ton of cancer causing chemicals. She said sleeping on these mattresses was like smoking 2 packs a day. My mom came over, stripped my bed, and set it outside to air out the chemicals. I joke that she probably just added some cancer causing pollution to the mix.</p>

<p>I heard there is some sort of controversy surrounding fire retardants too. I downloaded a documentary. Gonna go watch it. </p>

<p>Cancer treatment seems very much lets see what kills you first the treatment or the cancer and maybe we will be lucky and most of the damage we cause your body will be to the cancer cells then you can be cancer free. </p>

<p>AstraZeneca was owned by Imperial Chemical Industries, a leading international manufacturer of industrial chemicals and carcinogenic pesticides. AstraZeneca has made multimillion dollar contributions to American Cancer Society, influencing just about everything that the ACS does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just remember – cigarettes are far easier to quit than they make them out to be.</p>

<p>WARNING – CIGARETTES ARE HIGHLY ADDICTIVE</p>

<p><em>there is no way you&#39;re going to give them up, so don&#39;t even try</em></p>

<p>Honestly, it mostly just comes down to whether, deep inside your psyche, you really want to quit them. If you do, just go cold turkey, throw away your last pack and don&#39;t buy any more. Then monitor your physiological state as you withdraw.</p>

<p>&quot;Am I feeling so bad right now?&quot;</p>

<p>The answer is never yes. It&#39;s psychosomatic! You expect cravings, so you feel them. If you believe that cigarettes aren&#39;t actually addictive, you realise that the unusual feeling of quitting is just breaking a habit, like, stopping biting your fingernails or something.</p>
