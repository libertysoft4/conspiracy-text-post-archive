        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With Prime Minister Narendra Modi in attendance (as seen in the picture), and various other prestigious scientists from all over the world, the Indian Science Congress is probably the last place you would expect a presentation regarding ancient flying machines that could traverse the Solar System. For the first time in the history of the congress, a presentation was given outlining the depiction of these ancient flying ‘space ships.’</p>

<p>These flying machines have been depicted in multiple Sanskrit texts such as the Vedas, the Puranas and more. What’s even more remarkable is the fact that this type of machinery, and the concept of intelligent extraterrestrial life is not limited to ancient Sanskrit (Hinduism and Buddhism), but is found in several different ancient civilizations that span across the globe, according to many scholars and academicians. This doesn’t mean it’s true, but it does mean that the subject should be able to be examined with an open mind, without ridicule and condemnation.</p>

<p>The idea of mixing in a serious talk on ancient Indian flying machines when presentations on more rigid research and science policy issues are being discussed, at a major science conference, in my opinion, is great. It probably opened the minds of many who otherwise would have not even thought about something like this in the first place.</p>

<p>The lecture was given by Captain Anand Bodas, a retired pilot and head of a pilot training facility. The presentation was titled “Ancient Indian Sciences Through Sanskrit.” The lecture sent a jolt through the congress, and didn’t come without any backlash.  A NASA scientist, Ram Prasad Gandhiraman was so upset that he started an online petition demanding that the Indian Science Congress cancel the lecture, because (in his opinion) it mixed science with mythology. (source)</p>

<p>According to RT news, here is one quote from the lecture:</p>

<p>“There is a reference to ancient aviation in the Rigveda (Vedic Sanskrit Hymns). The basic structure was of 60 by 60 feet, and in some cases, over 200 feet. They were jumbo planes, the ancient planes had 40 small engines. Today’s aviation does not know even of a flexible exhaust system.” (source)</p>

<p>These types of concepts and ideas have been gaining more popularity, which in turn has lead to mainstream television shows like “Ancient Aliens,’ one that is commonly aired on the discovery channel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw a video last week that talked for a bit about a scientist named Maxwell. Apparently he believed that electricity and electromagnetism had a higher dimensional nature and his original equations reflected this. Then some other guy named Heavyside reworked all of Maxwell&#39;s equations to remove anything related to higher dimensionality.</p>

<p>There are some who believe that Maxwell&#39;s original, lost equations may have held the secret to using electricity in all sorts of new ways. One of these being the use of electricity to counter gravity by converting energy directly into propulsive force without the need for a propellant.</p>

<p>Also interesting to consider that this technology was known in the ancient past. Perhaps this has something to do with why so many ancient cultures worshiped warrior gods who ruled the skies with lightning? (eg. Thor, Zeus, Indra, Baal etc.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically the founder of EM theory...bummer that he&#39;s not well known and referred to as &#39;a scientist named maxwell&#39; (nothing personal). </p>

<p>Heavyside simplified the equations into vector calculus, making them much more usable. But you are correct, there is the potential that scientific possibility was lost in translation. Maxwell&#39;s work was about 20 equations I believe, and they were condensed to 4. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the one! His EM work came about after observing the experiments of Michael Faraday. Faraday was also an established scientist, but a chemist not a mathematician. He was the first to experiment with the magnetic effects of current passing through a wire. These experiments laid the groundwork for Maxwell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the West, the theory was really first publicized in the 1960&#39;s by the Swiss author (hotel porter at the time) Erik von Daniken who has written 50+ books on the subject. <a href="http://www.daniken.com/e/bibliography.shtml">http://www.daniken.com/e/bibliography.shtml</a> But he&#39;s making so much money from it now that he will say anything. </p>

<p>Graham Hancock picked up the torch in the 90&#39;s with his excellent book Fingerprints of the Gods. <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53325.Fingerprints_of_the_Gods">http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53325.Fingerprints_of_the_Gods</a> But he went deep into South American drug culture and is starting to sound less scientific these days. But he is so jaded from defending his position against academia that it&#39;s sort of understandable.</p>

<p>Robert Bauval was the guy who rediscovered the link between the Giza pyramids and the Orion constellation, and he and Hancock have written some good books together.</p>

<p>Then we have Giorgio Tsoukalos who is basically Von Danikens mouthpiece for the US market that can&#39;t deal with Swiss accents. He will say anything for notoriety.</p>

<p>Michael Tellinger is another one pushing the theory but he tends to focus on African history. And most of what he says is a repeat of what Credo Mutwa told him. And poor Mr Mutwa has teamed up with David Icke who has very little credibility but a massive following.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not into reading books, you can find plenty of radio interviews on Youtube where these guys promote their books and summarize the main arguments. Hancock and Bauval are the guys who have a brain though, and they meticulously reference almost all of their claims. The others are in it for the money as far as I can see.</p>

<p>One very interesting person in this saga is the Austrian museum curator Klaus Dona. He doesn&#39;t re-hash everyone elses work, and through his contacts in the museum business has access to some amazing artifacts. But there is no real proof of their age.</p>

<p>The idea of an ancient pre-flood high civilisation has sort of been mixed in with the idea of aliens visiting us in ancient times, and that&#39;s a pity IMO because there is plenty of evidence for an ancient high civilisation and not so much for ancient aliens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem!</p>

<p>The thing about this whole topic, and every &#39;alternative&#39; topic for that matter is that there&#39;s a lot of money to be made from it. Apart from the books there are TV shows, DVD movies and lecture tours. von Daniken has sold over 65 million books in 32 languages. <a href="http://www.daniken.com/e/">http://www.daniken.com/e/</a> Other people have seen that market and jumped on the bandwagon. </p>

<p>So you have to be critical of what they say. Once you&#39;ve been around the topic for a while you&#39;ll see there is a relatively small amount of information regurgitated in different ways. But it&#39;s all interesting. Even the absolutely crazy stuff is interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is probably a lot of info in German which relates to Dona and his artifacts. Stuff that never got translated. He was involved in touring exhibitions of strange artifacts for several years before he did any English-language interviews.</p>

<p>He has said the majority of stuff came from private collections and so we may never find out about their provenance. I&#39;m sure a lot of the pieces are technically illegal to possess. As in, the countries they were taken from (mostly South American I think) lay claim to them. So details on who owns them and how they got them is probably not forthcoming.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s time to learn to read German :)</p>
