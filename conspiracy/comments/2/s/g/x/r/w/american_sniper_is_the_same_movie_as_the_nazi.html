    <div class="md"><p>Snipers have long been used for military propaganda campaigns because they kill a lot of people and make it feel like you&#39;re winning the war.</p>

<p>On a side note I do suspect that there is a conspiracy based around Chris Kyle.  </p>

<p>Jesse Ventura had plans to run for presidency until he was accused of getting in a fight with Chris Kyle at a bar, thus ruining any chance he had of running.  You can&#39;t get in a fight with a war hero and take the highest seat in public office. </p>

<p>Chris Kyle was clearly lying about it (as was decided by a jury) and was getting called out on it everywhere.  He then became suspiciously better at lying about it which indicated someone was coaching him.  Then he is suspiciously shot by PTSD suffering Eddie Ray Routh at a shooting range.  </p>

<p>If that&#39;s not enough suspicious for a conspiracy then I don&#39;t know what is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That motherfucker fought everywhere. He liked to grapple and was good at it. He shot someone in a pistol duel after being shot himself. He waited to shoot and hope that the other guy shooting would try shoot him as quick as possible and his aim would not be very good. The other guy spun around and shot Jackson in the chest. After that Jackson took steady aim and put one bullet in the guys head. He also beat down an assassin who had two guns fail him when he was trying to shoot Jackson in the senate, he took his cane and beat him nearly to death. When they didn&#39;t analysis on the pistols and the ammo inside they found no reason for the guns to have malfunctioned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lincoln was an accomplished wrestler.  IIRC he never lost a grappling match...out of hundreds.</p>

<p>Looked <a href="http://www.history.com/news/10-things-you-may-not-know-about-abraham-lincoln">it up.</a></p>

<p>Defeated only once in approximately 300 matches, Lincoln reportedly talked a little smack in the ring. According to Carl Sandburg’s biography of Lincoln, Honest Abe once challenged an entire crowd of onlookers after dispatching an opponent: “I’m the big buck of this lick. If any of you want to try it, come on and whet your horns.” There were no takers. Lincoln’s grappling exploits earned him an “Outstanding American” honor in the National Wrestling Hall of Fame.</p>

And all he talks about is how badly he wants to kill. And he tells stories of &quot;maybe beating up this guy&quot; like maybe it did or didn&#39;t happen. He tries to be all cute with his rough and tough attitude, but he just comes across as an useful idiot. He makes America look bad too. We&#39;re already tainted by the idiocy that comes from small towns in Texas. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw piers morgan, and he was shaking like a 90 year old man and as much as what he was saying resonates with people, there is no way in hell he is politically dangerous to the establishment. Hes got some serious delusions of grandeur too, I laughed my ass off when he stated that he wanted to be the next hunter s thompson. That was almost insulting to the good doctor. Then he stated that he wanted to run for president with ron paul, who never made a statement about that,  but Im sure he laughed his ass off as well. Sure he says some interesting things, but hes in no way politically relevant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you even seen the film? I suspected some American army propaganda film going in, but it was not that at all. The main takeaway is that the soldiers over there don&#39;t believe in what they&#39;re doing, and constantly question why they&#39;re over there and whether the orders they&#39;re being given should be followed.</p>

<p>The other main takeaway is that the PTSD Chris Kyle had was making him suicidal, and the experience of war soldiers are having over there is making it impossible for them to assimilate back into regular life. They showed that the main reason American soldiers keep going back into war is because they had friends and family members who died for the &quot;cause&quot; and they felt like they were abandoning them by being back in America doing mundane, everyday activities. Chris Kyle even refers to his kill count title as something he wouldn&#39;t wish on anyone.</p>

<p>This film delves deeper into the negative side of PTSD and is more anti-war than any highly advertised, expensively produced war film I&#39;ve seen. The comparison to Nazi propaganda makes absolutely no sense unless you watched this film with a blindfold on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imho, wished they we&#39;re heavier on the PTSD display, sure what they depicted was &quot;quite&quot; accurate, but from someone who actually has PTSD, there are A LOT more triggers then displayed, He just seemed to stoneface through them, thats not quite what happens regardless of training, you start breaking down, the only real breakdown was at one of the last scenes (the belt). It would have happened waay sooner.</p>

<p>But thats just my five cents, kinda liked the movie though, not in a &quot;&#39;murica&quot; way, more of a &quot;Wow&quot; way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I agree, but there were scenes such as his kids birthday party with the dog and when he&#39;s sitting in front of the blank tv where you really got the feeling that is was consuming his entire consciousness, which is more than I can say for most big name movies on the subject.  They probably still wanted to portray him as more stoic than he was given it was biographical and he has passed away, also easier to act the &#39;completely numbed out of all emotion by war&#39; well than breaking down consistently I dunno if Bradley Cooper coulda done that properly.</p>

<p>Some of the scenes though like showing his relationship with his wife falling apart and the letter at the funeral.. definitely liked the film thought they did a decent job. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hold up, I can kinda see where you&#39;re coming from with how the movie portrays &quot;them&quot; as bad guys but they sure as hell don&#39;t always portray America as the good guys and if that&#39;s all you saw then you weren&#39;t paying attention. </p>

<p>Spot on with nazi propaganda? Are you serious? Nobody who can reason logically will come away from that movie will see joining the army in any kind of positive light. Between your friends dying all around you, your family falling apart, having suicidal flashbacks that intrusively fill your consciousness, and not having a single soldier portrayed as honestly convinced of their mission, which part is supposed to make me want to join the army?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not even American but I can respect when a film maker can take what had to be some of the most expensive rights to a life story in the past several years and create a film you can step away from feeling no envy for the soldiers but only sorrow for their misguided cause. If you were expecting the movie to come out and label America&#39;s military presence entirely realistically then you have a poor understanding of the world of Hollywood production plain and simple.</p>

Jesus the movie went completely over your head that shit was all parody of previous movies championing American warmongering.

<p>White washing of ptsd who did you see who was coping well exactly?  You&#39;re mad about a couple lines and a bit of symbolism get the fuck outta here, people like the &quot;san diego or new york&quot; guy do exist and the guy who responded to that didn&#39;t even agree gree that was even a possible threat. You wanted to see it as a propaganda film so that&#39;s what you saw don&#39;t spout off at me because you can&#39;t accept a movie called American Sniper wasn&#39;t pro war.

<p>You come off as egotistical and fully blinded to any other viewpoints other than your own, at least when it comes to politics in which you get extremely aggressive. I&#39;m taking a gander that you&#39;re a left leaning, self hating American, who&#39;s understanding of realpolitik is limited to some idealistic vision of what the world should be or at least what our policies should be. Hell you probably support massive cuts to the military budget, to fund science R&amp;D or some shit; while not without its merits it ignores the reality if geopolitics and global stability.</p>

<p>Hell maybe your one of those ultrahypocrites that lives full on the hog of Western hegemony and imperialism while bashing against it. Like those who rail against exploiting the third world while at the same time buying 3/4&#39;s of their shit from said exploited individuals.</p>

<p>yes the movie has its moments of patriotism, symbolism and pandering, but most of the vets I&#39;ve seen the movie with thought it was primarily a movie about PTSD and dealing with it, that leaned to a more anti war spectrum. You just want to see only jingosism and propaganda, while most movie critics see a pro-war individual in an anti-war film. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not even close, I see the world as grey. I support my country over others because my family and my friends live here. I care for them more than other people, as is natural for the majority of humans. I support American imperialism because I&#39;d rather we rule the world than say China. I support the continuation of western hegemony and crushing any who rise to challenge it, because as history shows once that challenge arises there will be war. We&#39;re lucky to live under Pax Americana.</p>

<p>Also like how we push our &#39;liberal&#39; cultural values on the rest of the world, why? Because while I understand cultural relativism, I prefer western values and would rather have them be the dominant values.</p>

<p>I also support universal healthcare because it&#39;s cost effective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you should read up on material based on realpolitik and geopolitics.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a competition, simply because resources, land are finite, and ideologies clash. If it wasn&#39;t you wouldn&#39;t have wars, you wouldn&#39;t have a US geopolitics shift to the Pacific, you wouldn&#39;t have a US policy of arming our allies, the same allies that happen to border china. If it wasn&#39;t for us you&#39;d have a China aggressively expanding its territory in the SCS and Taiwan.</p>

<p>Less than 100 years ago we had to deal with Imperial Japan and the Third Reich, then following that the Soviet Union. Do you think in less than 100 years humans have evolved so much that situations like that cannot happen again? Fuck we&#39;re barbarians pretending to be civilized. The only reason we haven&#39;t had another major war is because no one has a chance in Hell against the US and it&#39;s allies. But what happens when China modernizes it&#39;s military and has a sizable navy?</p>

<p>Man has been in competition since the dawn of civilization. Over resources, land, and ideology (read cold war).</p>

<p>The wealth of one group comes at the expense of another.</p>

<p>Of course you can go, &quot;but we are all people blah blah we should share the earth equally,&quot; but then someone with a bigger stick comes along. </p>

<p>People tend to think history is fiction when history is the true story of humanity. Read on the depredations of older societies, of the barbarism and realise that those people are, biologically, as evolved as you. Also that many of those individuals are highly educated.</p>

<p>Edit: what is happening right now in the halls of power of every government is the same thing that happened in Machiavelli&#39;s the Prince. So is suggest you read up in power politics <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_politics">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_politics</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Techniques of power politics include, but are not limited to, conspicuous nuclear development, pre-emptive strike, blackmail, the massing of military units on a border, the imposition of tariffs or economic sanctions, bait and bleed and bloodletting, hard and soft balancing, buck passing, covert operations, shock and awe and asymmetric warfare.</p>

<p>Sounds like everything that every country does, and the US/NATO is simply the best at it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know I support your view over mine any day, but that&#39;s not how the world works.</p>

<p>Every country engages in political realism, realpolitik, in power politics. Hell people who study political realism have created very accurate models of geopolitical actions and their responses. </p>

<p>Just look at the links I&#39;ve shown you and then look at the foreign policy of every major power. They&#39;re all that way, I wish it was peace and brotherly love but then Russia starts destabilizing it&#39;s neighbors, Saudi Arabia destabilized Iraq and Iran with lowered oil prices/hits our shale production/fucks Russia, then China pushes aggressively in the south China sea, then it&#39;s neighbors start rearment because they&#39;re afraid. Then you have the upcoming Africa situation.</p>

<p>Political realism may by barbaric by your standards but that is the way the world currently operates, and if you don&#39;t play the game then you lose.</p>

<p>My ideas are outdated?</p>

<p>When was WW2?</p>

<p>When was the cold war?</p>

<p>When did the Berlin wall fall?</p>

<p>When did Argentina invade the Falklands?</p>

<p>When did Saddam invade Kuwait?</p>

<p>When did Russia invade Georgia</p>

<p>When did they destabilize Ukraine?</p>

<p>When did China start becoming highly aggressive in the south China sea?</p>

<p>When did its neighbors start an arms build up?</p>

<p>Should we start counting the acts of genocide Over the past 100 years.</p>

<p>If we exist 1000 years from now I have no doubt we&#39;ll run into an alien species that wishes to kill us and take our habitable worlds, or is possibly a warrior species, or xenophobic, or religious crusaders, etcetc or a synthetic race that is hostile to organics. Hell many scientists are rethinking the idea of looking for alien species, because what happens when the message we get back is &quot;shut up they&#39;ll hear you,&quot; or &quot;surrender&quot;. </p>

<p>There&#39;s always those who will wish for power, we where no different 2000 years ago I doubt another 1000 will change us so extremely.</p>

<p>oh yeah, the zeitgeist movement, I agree with it, I do. </p>

<p>But here&#39;s an analogy, I&#39;m playing halo, I can&#39;t change the disc, the world has to change the disc at around the same time. So I&#39;m going to continue playing halo the way you&#39;d play halo, if I tried to play halo the same way you&#39;d play Madden then we might as well let China influence global policy or Russia. First the rest of the world has to turn into not too corrupt democracies and economies have to integrate. Then you need to start solar system level resource extraction, then MAYBE you could start a resource based economy or a massive BI.</p>

<p>Also what happens when a country tried to follow today plans, but then another country produces more under the capitalist system? The most effective systems win out.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t even try to counter my arguments on what is actually happening in the world. Pax Americana, power politics and the international standard of political realism which are all currently reality. You&#39;ve entirely changed the subject and disregarded every other point I&#39;ve made. Of countries like China in regards to the SCS and Russia in regards to eastern Europe. Maybe you should study foreign policy and geopolitics, you know in a college setting. See how well your arguments would go over.</p>

<p>I totally agree maybe most aliens are probably nice, but what happens if one of them isn&#39;t? What you&#39;re suggesting is in 1000 years we don&#39;t have an army, I&#39;d like it myself, BUT what happens if sometime after that we meet a species that isn&#39;t nice? Or a synthetic that isn&#39;t a fan of organic life? To assume that every species capable of interstellar travel is nice is naivety.</p>

<p>This film delves deeper into the negative side of PTSD and is more anti-war than any highly advertised, expensively produced war film I&#39;ve seen. The comparison to Nazi propaganda makes absolutely no sense unless you watched this film with a blindfold on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you miss Full Metal Jacket?</p>

<p>And it doesn&#39;t dive deep into PTSD at all. It isn&#39;t even acknowledged by name. Anyone watching can misinterpret it as him being stuck in his old ways or just having trouble transitioning back to civilian life. Both of which don&#39;t define what PTSD actually is.</p>

<p>The Nazi propaganda is spot on. We were cheering for a guy in foreign soil with a high kill count just because the ones dying were the &quot;bad guys&quot;. I kind of disliked that they treated the bad guys like B-movie/80s cliche villains that moves like ninjas and ran like zombies towards a fire fight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not going to lie, and I realize this entirely disqualifies me on the subject, but I still have to watch Full Metal Jacket.</p>

<p>It&#39;s acknowledged by acronym, perhaps not by name. The portrayal of what he was going through was the same regardless if you place the label of PTSD on it or not, they were conveying the same symptoms. The point was that they showed the effects of war keeping him from assimilating back to his regular life, which contributed to an overall narrative of the experiences of a soldier being absolutely detrimental to any hopes of living a normal life. </p>

<p>Spot on? For real? Who was cheering? Fair enough on their portrayals of the &#39;bad guys&#39; but I&#39;m not sure what you expected, if you thought you were going to watch a movie where the &#39;deadliest sniper in American history&#39; kills a bunch of innocent Iraqis performing ambiguously dangerous activity then you&#39;re not factoring in anything to do with the limitations of producing a movie like this with some of the most expensive life story rights in the past several years. Nobody with a brain can step away from that movie seeing the army in a positive light, which is more than I can say for most war movies. As for comparisons to Nazi propaganda get the fuck outta here</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I may not always be right, but I&#39;m never wrong. IT feels fantastic. It probably stems from graduating HS when I was 13, JD by 20, MD by 27, followed by 13 years of various computer programming disciplines in 7 countries. If I&#39;m wrong about something, I find out why and correct it. You should try it sometimes. The more you know, the less you know. Living in a bubble of ignorance helps nobody, including yourself.

Not everyone is geared toward college and allowing large manufacturers to move jobs abroad has left a void in low education median payed jobs...guess who picked up the slack? Dumbasses willing to die for corporate greed.</p>

<p>I was a base kid/brat. Circumnavigated the globe 7 times, 28 countries. I&#39;m quite familiar with the military lifestyle.</p>

<p>I never coast...I just kick the gear up and keep on grinding.</p>

<p>I hope your brother makes it out unscathed and can contribute back to the world. I wonder how many ex-service men(aka mercenaries) go back to the countries where they raped, killed and pillaged...to make amends? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any movie that depicts the armed forces of America going through &quot;trials and tribulations&quot; in the ME with their 800 billion dollar a year &quot;defense&quot; budget is an overblown, repetitive bullshit propagandist film to further instil the notion of American suffering as if it is the central thesis in the entirety of the conflict.</p>

<p>Sick of hearing American complaints and the circle jerk to our armed service men who are just an extension of our disgusting foreign policy.</p>

<p>One truly vile thing about American culture is how honored their enlisted are - not because of what they do but because of what they represent. To the dumb average majority American it is freedom, liberty, honor blah blah. </p>

<p>The realist would view the American soldier as the mechanical arm that wields the guns and risks his/her life to push for more aggressive policy. They also get paid well contrary to Republican narrative and they can get paid even more if they go into private contracting.</p>

<p>This movie will sell because its an &#39;edgy&#39; stance on an old conflict. Woah bro it hits on a GRAY area, see, its almost like, war is bad bro! But yeah go AMERICA! Wow what a hero! This is about the SERVICEMEN! Continue the circlejerk of praise and adoration! Because PATRIOTISM!</p>

<p>Go fuck yourself Eastwood and Kyle.</p>

<p>Nobody should honor these guys. We need a cultural shift where we view the military and people enlisted as life-fuck ups who have nothing else going for them instead of doctors and engineers. Until then, the elite will continue to milk this narrative until we have the Armarinavys dicks so far down our throat we can&#39;t utter a word without spitting empty shells of fascism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw the film and was in Iraq at the time Kyle was there and I&#39;m a Texan. </p>

<p>First impressions were that the portrayal of combat were bullshit. It shows a clean scenario where the enemy is well defined with no fog of war. Kids get killed because they are engaged in combat or in a legit target, after the place gets fragged up is when you find out who died.</p>

<p>Second most enlisted in my opinion are reasonable people often too young to know the impact of their decisions until it is too late, kinda like putting your dick in crazy.  That being said I worked EOD on joint operations with all kinds a SF and foreign troops. My experience is that most SF guys are like Kyle is portrayed, Murdering sociopaths who get a hard on from killing &quot;Savages&quot;. I went to Iraq to kill &quot;terrorists&quot; but soon after I got there I realized that most of the people were just fighting to protect their homes and families.  It was just as easy to make friends as it was to make enemies. </p>

<p>In the film the Iraqi people were portrayed only as enemies or victims, not as people just as capable as any other person. This movie will attract the kind of person the top brass wants for its next war, Elitist minded murders that kill because they are better than the &quot;savages&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m willing to meet my maker and answer for every shot I took.&quot; - Kyle</p>

<p>Fuck you Kyle, I hope your hell is to live in life of every parent of the people you killed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say <em>Stolz der Nation</em> is a mix of <em>Lone Survivor</em> and <em>American Sniper</em>, which conveniently came out in the same year.</p>

<p>Goebbels would have wet himself if he had the ability to make high production propaganda films like these. They cast A-list actors that are favored for their past comedy and drama performances to draw in all audiences. They slap on the &quot;based on a true story&quot; label and get some military film critics to say some nice words about how &quot;truthful&quot; the films are then they&#39;re set to make millions on opening weekend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just watched the first few scenes. In the military and in the film industry they are all retarded.</p>

<p>For example, a group of soldiers, walk in the open in the middle of the street. Their cover is this hero sniper. Now, one woman with a child had enough of them and they decide to get out in the middle of the street, walk towards them with a heavy grenade. Presumably the kid can throw the heavy grenade from miles away, else is not explained how all those soldiers can&#39;t see him just in front of them and they need a sniper to located and kill it. What a bunch of screenplay writers idiots. Fortunately, the fact that Hollywood is a close system  have the advantage for us that they use iPhone starbucks hipster writers with no contact with the reality and their propaganda fails because of this. You can have all the cinematography and effects and costumes and music but if your story don&#39;t connect with your propaganda target you throw your money out of window.</p>

<p>There is hope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They use that scene for the ads and it makes me sick. The idea of a situation where a sniper would have to kill a child because they had a grenade and were just about to blow up soldiers is so ridiculous.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not saying kids don&#39;t sometimes try stuff in these situations, but the idea that the spots the kid holding the grenade and there is this big moment where he has to struggle to decide between killing a kid and saving his friends... it&#39;s just so hollywood and contrived. Makes me puke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea that the sniper is looking through his scope seeing the kid handed a grenade and then having all this time to make the big decisions whether to kill a kid or let his buddies die is what&#39;s contrived to me.</p>

<p>In reality the kid would probably just pop out from behind a wall and throw the grenade or would have it concealed and the sniper would have no idea he had it. </p>

<p>The whole idea that the sniper has advanced knowledge and has the time to make this big, patriotic decision is what seems contrived to me.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m forced to either murder a child or save my friends. Being a soldier is so hard, pity and respect me&quot; - that&#39;s what it seems like to me. And my response is don&#39;t go over there and you don&#39;t want to be in those situations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, couldn&#39;t agree more - my thought is that it&#39;s propaganda of a much subtler kind.</p>

<p>&quot;Consider the negatives of war&quot; as in &quot;consider the plight of our soldiers, look at all of the sacrifices they&#39;re making for our freedoms - look at the toll this is taking on their psyches&quot;, meanwhile ignoring the fact that we <em>shouldn&#39;t be over there at all</em> and ignoring all of the death and destruction we&#39;re causing.</p>

<p>I mean obviously it&#39;s going to be pretty psychologically damaging when one starts realizing that they&#39;ve been committing murder to line the pockets of some rich men who&#39;ve never gone near a battlefield and killing strangers halfway around the world who never did anything to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything about Chris Kyle is wrong. He brags about killing more human beings than any other sniper. All he cared about was the number. He probably inflated it falsely, and you can bet that at least 100 of the people he killed were completely innocent woman, children and old men.</p>

<p>Then he accused Ventura of something Ventura would never do, and naturally when Ventura takes him to court, Kyle loses, because there were no witnesses to back up his false story. Kyle was told to go after Ventura by some controller.</p>

<p>Then he is killed by one of his buddies at a firing range. There&#39;s no doubt in my mind that this was an execution of Kyle by the same people who ordered him to get Ventura.</p>

<p>Kyle has been nothing but a glory-seeker and a puppet his entire adult life. If the truth were ever known about his sniper hits, he would be completely disgraced. He was a mass murderer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just watched this and I must say it is not a blatant propaganda movie such as Nation&#39;s Pride, that is a harsh comparison since the focus of the story, aside tons of sniper kills, is actually the sniper himself and how the shit he does changes and influences him as a man. He is not even shown in the light of a hero, rather a motivated guy that has some &quot;saviour&quot; issues. I believe Clint wanted to portray his simple yet steely resolve in dealing with his job as heroic, yet fails to do so since the sniper himself is pretty fed up with that shit and shows considerable repulsion towards his killing prowes. It is far from a great movie tho, it&#39;s very watered down without a clear arc, but it&#39;s hardly a propaganda movie like lone survivor.</p>

<p>b) It&#39;s war, not a murder spree. He is picking off confirmed insurgents who are threats to the soldiers in the streets.</p>

<p>c) Most of the film is about all the PTSD he suffers and how it nearly ruins his marriage, and in the end that same PTSD in another vet is what kills him. So this is hardly a propaganda film, since knowing about PTSD is going dissuade people from joining the military.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I take it you don&#39;t agree with capital punishment either?</p>

<p>The distinction between mass murder and warfare might come down to semantics, but it is worth discussing. </p>

<p>War is a violent but sometimes necessary means to an end. Wars are historically fought over land, resources, and (sadly) religion. More more recently they are still fought over land, but often (from the West&#39;s perspective) not with the goal of conquest, but merely removing the current political power which has been oppressing people or causing problems for other countries. War is fought between nations, or at least between large groups within nations, and is an organized endeavor where the killing is done for strategic purposes.</p>

<p>Murder, on the other hand, is simply ending life because you wanted to, often out of anger. Stalin and Mao (to not trip Godwin&#39;s Law) murdered millions of innocents in their own countries, they did not go to war with these people, they simply rounded them up and killed them, or killed them in their homes.</p>

<p>Now, someone who participated in the cultural cleansings of Russia or China would indeed be a murder. Someone like Chris Kyle, who was simply protecting his unit during the course of the war and happened to kill a lot of people because of his unique position and skill is much more difficult to classify as such, IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, no, there have been numerous multi-year stretches of time when we were not at war as a country, including most of the 6 years before the war in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>I agree that there have been numerous small conflicts and a few larger ones over the history of our nation, but when you are a world power like we are, doing nothing would often be a worse course of action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you see the movie? I did. Based on your summary, I am pretty sure you didn&#39;t. It is very complex and doesn&#39;t &quot;justify&quot; anything. It is left up to you to take from it what you will, which is why right wing war lovers are so rah rah about it. They are ignoring the intricacies of the character.</p>

<p>My biggest complaint however is that the true nature of the &quot;star&quot; of the film is glossed over. He said very clearly he didn&#39;t give a shit about &quot;those savages&quot; and was clearly a xenophobe and a liar (see Jesse Venture). Whether that was what he had to tell himself to do the job isn&#39;t really delved into and the Jesse Ventura part isn&#39;t even mentioned.</p>

<p>It seems to me he exaggerated some of his &quot;exploits&quot; and it was glossed over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly anyone who saw this as propaganda is just trying to be offended. This was a true story, and yes in the beginning the sheep and wolf talk WASNT SUPPOSED TO BE THE MORAL OF THE FILM it was a set up for his character. MANY people have this type of view. On top of that he went after 9\11 SO YES HE WOULD BE VERY PATRIOTIC  AND SEE THEM AS SAVAGES! how many war movies have you seen that have the guy sit and talk about how cool and justified the enemy is? And to anyone saying its one sided, its called AMERICAN SNIPER if you want so!ething to show the other side watch something called Iran Warrior. Its not Americas job to make movie for every other country. We like making movies for americans and we like to watch movies ABOUT AMERICANS! Honestly this movie showed him breaking down and PTSD over his actions. Also it shows the consequences of war for an individual, seeing awful things, losing friends, family problems, and PTSD. honestly, this movie only deterred me from joining then military, if you want to complain about American propaganda complain about pretty much every war movie that isnt about Vietnam! Youre all anti war idiots who can&#39;t understand this film! Clint eastwood made both Flags of our Fathers and Letters of Iwo Jima both of which are amazing pieces of balanced storytelling. War is Hell and this movie wasn&#39;t about the politics of this one. I feel like you anti war people are letting your hate for this war boil over to the soldiers who fought it.</p>
