        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I thought it was weird that I didn&#39;t learn Critical Thinking until community college, but I figured it was just a fluke... until I read this huffingtonpost article <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-shammas/for-a-better-society-teac_b_2356718.html">For a Better Society, Teach Philosophy in High Schools</a> which mirrors a lot of my concerns (for example, the author of the article didn&#39;t learn any Philosophy [I&#39;m assuming critical thinking courses] until College as well).  However, it was really the Cotton Bowl section at the tail end that really hit the matter on the nose.  We used to have a highly intellectual culture that our founding father&#39;s enjoyed... arguably still do, but it&#39;s reserved for the ~privileged.</p>

<p>I believe our society mirrors a lot of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2sva3m/aldous_huxley_vs_george_orwell_predictions_xpost/">Huxley&#39;s</a> concerns in Brave New World, where we are drowned out by a lot of noise and entertainment.</p>

<p>This blurb can be found in the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/2srbpy/for_a_better_society_teach_philosophy_in_high/cnsie50">comment section</a> of this article</p>

<p>Here it is though for reivew:</p>

<p>While I do agree with the premise of this article.  I don&#39;t think Critical Thinking is a skill the United States cares to teach through it&#39;s public education systems (I have heard private school is a different story).  Because then it would be less factitious, and less easily controllable/predictable; important in a consumer economy.  I often think we are merely a market for the US to exploit.  The real interests of this government is not in educating us, but in the position the government has in the world.  They figure those who are educated will rise to the top of their own accord.  I also don&#39;t think the religious right would care for some of the discussions philosophy has (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/2srbpy/for_a_better_society_teach_philosophy_in_high/cnsb5nw">case in point</a>). [I have a cynical view of the way the US operates; especially considering Rome&#39;s pattern of Propaganda]. For more, see this about <a href="http://www.truthcontrol.com/files/truthcontrol/images/aldous_huxley_vs_george_orwell.jpg">Huxley&#39;s Brave New World</a></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t get my courses in critical thinking until Community College.</p>

<p>Even when it gets to Speech and Debate and critical thinking, one of the most important things they beat into you is to accept arguments by authority vs skepticism...  which is another story.  Hell, speech and debate is about reasoned arguments, but more so about sophism than it is about philosophy/truth (and it <em>counts as a critical thinking course</em>...).</p>

<p>On the other hand, my friend who attended school <strong>in Mexico</strong> knew about Aristotle from his High School lessons...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is shameful, because a person who does not understand the history of thought does not understand the rationality behind our political system</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speaking of the education our founding father&#39;s had</p>

<p><a href="https://southcarolina1670.wordpress.com/2014/07/18/college-200-years-ago-was-for-the-few-the-erudite/">https://southcarolina1670.wordpress.com/2014/07/18/college-200-years-ago-was-for-the-few-the-erudite/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“A candidate must be able to sustain a satisfactory examination upon Arithmetic and Elementary Algebra and English Grammar; upon Cornelius Nepos, Caesar, Sallust, and the whole of Virgil’s Aeneid in Latin; and in Greek upon the Gospels of Sts. John and Luke, the Acts of the Apostles, and the Greek Grammar.”</p>

<p><strong>And that was just to get into the school!</strong></p>

<p>The description goes on to add that “The studies to be pursued in the Freshman year are Cicero’s Orations and Odes of Horace in Latin, Xenophon’s Cyropaedia and Memorabilia in Greek, Adam’s Roman Antiquities, Vulgar and Decimal Fractions, the Equations and Extractions of Roots, English Grammar and Rhetoric.”</p>
</blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>I took a Business Law course (recently).  I used to feel exactly like this; still do in a lot of respects.  However, there is an overall theme going on that&#39;s based on Western Philosophy (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes">Four Causes</a>; example: meeting of the minds, and criminal intent derive from these].  What gets weird is SCOTUS rulings.  However, when there is no ruling, generally the courts will fall on common law.  I know, weird.  If you&#39;re curious about Business Law, I could recommend a book... but I can&#39;t seem to find it atm...</p>

<p>I was in the Marine Corps to, and got in trouble more than once and had to look up the UCMJ to give my lawyer&#39;s an argument to defend me with.  </p>

<p>Hell, I had an issue with a sale on amazon and had to look up &quot;implied warranty&quot; of which I would have had no idea about but I was able to finagle my way through to California Civil Code 1792 to ensure that a product sold to me as new meant I got to retain the manufacturer&#39;s warranty even if I didn&#39;t have the product registered in my name.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have young kids... One in K the other in pre.</p>

<p>I need to figure out something, I figure the best I can do is try to teach them critical thinking skills. I&#39;m really into philosophy ATM, reading Brumbraugh and an enyclo of philosophy edited by Zeyl plus a slew of other material, but I&#39;ve just started to read it at 33...</p>

<p>Spinoza, Kant, and Hume are on my list, but honestly I&#39;d prefer to read commentaries vs the actual docs, but I do have a list of docs I wish to eventually read (like some of Plato&#39;s work). I never even took a philosophy class (at a CSU, but I took a diff class), I just had some time off from work and started to read.</p>

<p>Update: Long Beach (where I live) has a good track record of paying it&#39;s teachers (back in 2005 HS teachers were averaging 40-45k; today it looks like <a href="http://www1.salary.com/CA/Long-Beach/high-school-teacher-salary.html">60k</a>), but... I know there not teaching critical thinking.  There is this new concept called Common Core where I&#39;m told they ask students &quot;why&quot; they came up with the answer they did... but there is a lot more they could be doing.  My son knows the names of the great 3 philosophers, Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato.  Hopefully when he gets older I can explain how they challenged and explored beyond what those around them told them to believe.  My kids are also bilingual, but other than that...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went through public school the whole way, my (older) brother was private from 7-12. The real difference I would say happened between us is that they were willing to advance and teach him at the pace he would learn at where as I was forced to do things like go through pre-algebra for 3 years (7th-8th-9th) despite passing it the first time. I was continually bored, not challenged and basically became disenfranchised with school (thus me not wanting to do college). When I&#39;m not at school I still watch educational videos and read scientific articles as well. </p>

<p>I&#39;m now 30 and almost done with an ME degree. What I would say public school did to me the most was make me angry at the system and feel I couldnt do anything to change it. Growing up however, my parents answered questions and encouraged critical thinking as well questioning authority. </p>

<p>That&#39;s an opinion formed from unscientific study of your own experiences. It is in no way a valid measure of anything more than that. </p>

<p>Perfect example: you claim to come from the upper class (which in your own opinion makes you smarter on average), yet here you are demonstrably failing to engage critical analysis of your own bias when presenting your views as fact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A while back? Lol 6 years in reddit time is dinosaurs roaming it seems. When I see accounts with age like yours I wonder how you could have delt with it for so long. </p>

<p>I mean I have been here for two burned my main getting into it with an admin. I got what I deserved I guess. My other is constantly trolled. So I use this now even thou it will be the next.</p>

<p>Anyways about your comment. The police state I am not convinced is entirely powers that be I also think it has to do with media in the 90s cramming gang wars and black men along with other minorities always being shown committing crimes. </p>

<p>Name a black serial killer that you have on the top of your head. I cant do it although I am sure they are out there. But you can name a few white guys. Maybe even their crimes. Its odd how the mentality of us cant be changed.</p>

<p>The public outcry from the 90s made the coos what they are now. The powers that be are nonexistent in my opinion.  There is no real head of the table all the players are fighting to get to the top of the ladder. Its evident in all that goes on with world events and staged stuff.</p>

<p>Yeah doubters there is some stuff that has been proven. So dont go sensationalist on me and say shit about sandy hook or something. </p>

<p>Here is the deal man I have an open mind otherwise I wouldn&#39;t be here. I really think the police state deal is a reaction to public demand. Now the police have only capitalized on it with enforcing laws they choose. </p>

<p>The classroom curriculum is questionable to say the least. The common core material is very suspect with all the political under tones. Personally I will need more info on the matter before I take a side. I will choose a side because I have a child and it is my job as a parent to do so.</p>

<p>Thanks for the link it is cool too see how people reacted back then as compared to now in that sub on your topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m reading a book called The Underground History of American Education by John Taylor Gatto, a dude who won NYC teacher of the year 3 years straight and NY state teacher of the year during that same period. The book is basically about his claims of how the school system has been used to create people who are more like minded, easier to control because of how they act around authority, less intelligent, and how school is also used as a way to get people to see the school system/state as a sort of parent, and lots of other shit this subreddit would love. He links Carnegie and Rockefeller interests into things that hugely shape the way way we ecucate our children, and how it was used to get people to move from independent lifestyles to learn to be subservient and get prepared for a life in a mass production economy run by administrations. Basically, his ideas and argument support this post. I highly recommend it, it&#39;s like 400 pages long, big read, but it&#39;s free if you google a pdf for it. He also wrote a book called Dumbing Us Down, which is something you could read in a day or two which is about the part where he says public school doesn&#39;t teach you to be as smart as you think it should. So go wild with these books if you give a shit to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Opinion rant:
It is this veterans opinion that the US is more concerned with us being workers and consumers.</p>

<p>While not directly related. Technological disobedience by reverse engineering electronics in Cuba using their <a href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=v-XS4aueDUg">little book</a> is exactly the kind of ingenuity we need in this nation vs blind reliance on technology. Its improvise, adapt, and overcome. Its know how, its gumption. Something our fast paced consumer society doesn&#39;t seem to have a need for. We are too diversified, too inter-reliant.</p>

<p>However, I&#39;m equally as guilty, I had the perfect opportunity to learn to be a mechanic from my father which is a perfect example of using ones mind to problem solve, but abandoned it for PC work which arguably isn&#39;t as hands on as computer electronics (another half finished opportunity) and feeds entirely into the consumer economy.  I have contributed to some software though.  Something as simple as a diff comparison I think is useful to critical thinking.</p>

<p>It all boils down to questioning authority.  Not rejecting, just merely questioning.  Trying to figure out motives and intentions and coming to one&#39;s own conclusions.</p>

<p>One area of major concern is how we do elections.  Our electorate is too uninformed.  That needs to be addressed somehow.</p>
