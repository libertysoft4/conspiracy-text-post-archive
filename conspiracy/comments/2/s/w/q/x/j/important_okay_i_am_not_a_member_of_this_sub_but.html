<p>Read through that. I first read through it when it was in the news 2 years ago. I get chills when I read it.</p>

<p>2 years ago, a nuclear scientist an entire family who was at the seen of the assassination, along with a couple of other witnesses, were murdered in the French alps, where they were on a trip, if I recall correctly. The killings were done in a professional way and the killers barely missed killing the ~5 year old girl of the bystander, Mr. Al-Hilli. This is important: there was a former French legionairre veteran on the scene soon after the shootings who tried to administer first aid to one of the daughters, and is part of the reason why they survived. Remember this, it is important.</p>

<p>One of the two daughters, a 7 year old girl, was shot in the shoulder and also in the head, but survived somehow.</p>

<p>French investigators described the shootings as &quot;professional&quot; and &quot;chillingly cold.&quot; All witnesses were eliminated.</p>

<p>This guy was a nuclear scientist with ties to various regimes, including possibly the Iranian one. </p>

<p><strong>Now just stop -- I am not a &quot;conspiratard&quot; or any other sort of gullible dumbass.</strong> I do not give credence to most so-called conspiracy theories, but in this case, this is just fucking crazy to not view this way.</p>

<p>This has Mossad&#39;s fingerprints all over it. They are known to have a history of assassinating Iranian nuclear scientists in Iran, and they even assassinated a nuclear scientist who was once working for Saddam Hussein in the 90s.</p>

<p><strong>It gets even more fucking scary.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.rivieratimes.com/index.php/provence-cote-dazur-article/items/new-twist-in-french-alps-unsolved-murder-case.html">http://www.rivieratimes.com/index.php/provence-cote-dazur-article/items/new-twist-in-french-alps-unsolved-murder-case.html</a></p>

<p>Remember what I said earlier about the former French legionairre veteran? <strong>There was a French legionairre veteran on the scene soon after the shootings.</strong> Police said he witnessed part of the shootings. </p>

<p>He was found dead by an &quot;apparent suicide&quot; earlier this year, with an intricately placed suicide note. He was shot dead, according to forensic examiners. It was tentatively ruled a suicide, although police made no final call on whether it actually was or not. He was the FINAL witness and he was eliminated.</p>

<p>2 years on, <strong>no suspects were ever found.</strong> </p>

<p>Seems like most people have already forgotten about it. I forgot about it, too, but I randomly remembered it when I was out for a jog a few days ago. </p>

<p>Remember your own words when they talk about charlie hebdo in a few yrs. Or when you listen to people talk about 9/11. Or fucking world war 2. There is so much shit that gets lost, it <strong><em>IS</em></strong> fucking scary. </p>

<p>And it is this kind of &quot;lost&quot; information that leads to &quot;conspiratards&quot; way of thinking. There is just no way that in every.fucking.single.event the most important and criminaljzing pieces of evidence get destroyed or otherwise &quot;lost&quot;. No way. </p>

<p>Feel free to continue discounting other theories that are out there. This one that you present, it may be personal to you. This may explain why things dont add up to you. And this is okay. </p>

<p>9/11 or whatever other &quot;conspiratard&quot; or otherwise &quot;gullible dumbass&quot; -type theory you may discount arent personal to you. <em>But they are to someone.</em> This is why these exist.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, I&#39;ve been thinking since the whole French thing in the news lately, the FFL would be a perfect front for Mossad, would it not?</p>

<p>A foreign force unconnected to Israel/the IDF/Israeli intelligence who Israel could use, they could take foreign nationals who migrate to Israel and want to be of service and give them fake documents and then send them to France/install them into the Foreign Legion. They take in these Jews from far away/other countries/various nationalities - and give them new papers, new life-stories, or just passports without &quot;Israel&quot; stamped on them - create people who appear to be normal/unconnected to any government in the world and unconnected to each other - and Mossad gives them fake documents and sends them over to France where these people apply to and join the French Foreign Legion using their Mossad-created cover identities / with their Mossad-issued documentation.</p>

<p>These men would be taken in to Israel, picked out of the normal Israeli immigrant population, recruited by Mossad or some other Israeli intelligence org, and repackaged as normal foreign nationals coming to the FFL from all over the world - sent to France to join the Legion and fill that force with Israeli assets who can then ascend through the ranks, maybe the Israelis also offer the French leadership there a large bribe/pension, or do the good old fashioned blackmail on them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s that simple - suddenly Israel has teams in a legitimate military force in western Europe. Done. Maybe they&#39;ve basically taken over the whole legion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you might find this article rather interesting. </p>

<p>Mind the author, and his rather unique credentials:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/7254807/Mossads-licence-to-kill.html">Mossad&#39;s licence to kill</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>The killing of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh bears the hallmarks of the ruthless Israeli intelligence service. One of the leading chroniclers of the agency gives a unique insight into its methods.</strong> </p>

<p>Article excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Within the global intelligence community, respect for Mossad grew following the kidon assassination of Dr Gerald Bull, the Canadian scientist who was probably the world&#39;s greatest expert on gun-barrel ballistics. Israel had made several attempts to buy his expertise. Each time, Bull had made clear his dislike for the Jewish state.</p>

<p>Instead he had offered his services to Saddam Hussein, to build a super-gun capable of launching shells containing nuclear, chemical or biological warheads directly from Iraq into Israel. Saddam had ordered three of the weapons at a cost of $20 million. Bull was retained as a consultant for a fee of $1 million.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of March 20, 1990, the sanction to kill Bull was given by the then prime minister, Yitzhak Shamir. Nahum Admoni, the head of Mossad, sent a three-man team to Brussels, where Bull lived in a luxury apartment block. Each kidon carried a handgun in a holster under his jacket.</p>

<p>When the 61-year-old Bull answered the doorbell of his home, he was shot five times in the head and the neck, each kidon firing their 7.65 pistol in turn, leaving Bull dead on his doorstep. An hour later they were out of the country on a flight to Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>Within hours, Mossad&#39;s own department of psychological warfare had arranged with sayanim in the European media to leak stories that Bull had been shot by Saddam&#39;s hit squad because he had planned to renege on their deal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really good example of the memory hole effect is MH17. It was all the media could talk about for a good week or two. Now they never mention it again, even though the investigation is ongoing.</p>

<p>The likely reasoning is because facts started to be determined which lead to questions about the official story. So really it&#39;s about coming to politically expedient conclusions, spamming them on air, and then not talking about it when contradictory facts come up.</p>

<p>If you bring up MH17 I&#39;m sure the response would be, &quot;that was like... over X months ago!&quot; Sigh.</p>
