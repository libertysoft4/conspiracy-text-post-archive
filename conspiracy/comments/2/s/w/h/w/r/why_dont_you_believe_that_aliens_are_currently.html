    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  While I might not go as far as to call it &quot;cancer&quot;, I will indeed definitely say that it&#39;s little more than distraction from what&#39;s really going on.</p>

<p>I&#39;m about one of the most serious people I know.  I&#39;m pretty consistently either getting called out or upsetting people for being &quot;too serious&quot;.  That never keeps me from continuing to take seriously the many things that I do nonetheless, but I will also say that occasional moments of brief levity aren&#39;t <em>the</em> worst thing in the world.  For this reason, I wouldn&#39;t begrudge that subreddit&#39;s facetiousness all too much.</p>

<p>Would you mind explaining, <em>exactly</em>, how they are racist and ignorant? I shouldn&#39;t need to start explaining things, you are the one who made the claims, and I am the one asking for specific clarification.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll go ahead and make this a little easier for you. You said they are racist and ignorant subs. I&#39;ll define those words for you, to make sure you understand them.</p>

<p>Racist - Believing that one race is superior to another</p>

<p>Ignorant - Lacking information</p>

<p>So could you explain to me how <a href="/r/niggers">/r/niggers</a> and <a href="/r/whiterights">/r/whiterights</a> believe they are a superior race, and explain what information they are lacking? Specifically. Thank you!</p>

<p>OK</p>

<p>Do you know who created the sub, <a href="/r/niggers">/r/niggers</a>? Do you know what race they are? </p>

<p>What does the history of the word &quot;nigger&quot; have to do with one race believing they are superior to another? Which races are we even talking about, all we know is the name of a sub.</p>

<p>And what information are they lacking exactly? What is it that these subs believe that is so errant? What information do you have for them?</p>

<p>What is it about <a href="/r/WhiteRights">/r/WhiteRights</a> that is racist and ignorant? Is it ignorant to believe that whites have rights? Is it racist to believe whites have rights? If so, could you explain how?</p>

<p>Please. Help me. </p>

<p>This post isn&#39;t about white rights, this post is about disparaging a whole race of people based upon the worst examples of that race of people.  You can do this to any race.  White people have some ridiculous groups just like black people do.  We have the KKK, the white national socialists, the rainbow tribe etc etc.</p>

<p>If the subreddit <a href="/r/whiterights">/r/whiterights</a> was on topic and specifically about white rights then it honestly wouldn&#39;t be that bad of a sub.  But in reality it&#39;s &quot;white people have rights took because look at how bad these black people act!&quot;... two subjects that aren&#39;t related.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe I have a warped view of national socialist based upon my experience with them.  I&#39;m willing to admit as much.  </p>

<p>Same goes for the KKK, never met one that I liked or that I was able to tolerate their proximity.  Rainbow tribe, bunch of criminals who pretend to be hippies.  </p>

<p>There is definitely a cross section of society that I prefer to deal with, a cross section that I find tolerable and a multitude of sections that I have no desire to acknowledge their existence.  I think most people probably feel the same way internally, I&#39;m not going to hang out with rainbow tribe people just to force diversity on myself, or national socialists or thugs or bible bangers.  I&#39;m just not interested.</p>

<p>I prefer what I prefer.  When people start talking in terms like &quot;sand niggers&quot; and &quot;coon people&quot; I tend to lose interest fairly quick.  When people start talking about &quot;cis privileges&quot; and &quot;neck beards&quot; I equally lose interest.</p>

<p>Evidence would suggest otherwise. So why make such a claim? It would actually be <strong>much</strong> more likely that <em>we</em> are the unintelligent species.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I guess you forgot Newton&#39;s first law. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll remind you, friend! Objects in motion, tend to stay in motion, unless acted upon by an outside force. But in the vacuum of space, there are no outside forces. So once you achieve the velocity you want, it actually takes no more energy to maintain that speed, no matter what distance you go!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and make crop circles and buttprobe some people. </p>

<p>You&#39;re absolutely right. There would be no need to travel anywhere just for that. Well, not outside of your own county anyway. But maybe they came for more reasons that what you currently understand?</p>

<p>Maybe they needed raw materials that they depleted on their planet. Maybe a part of restoring their atmosphere requires certain minerals found here on Earth? It&#39;s certainly a resource full planet. </p>

<p>Maybe they simply destroyed their planet and were out in space looking for a new planet to live on. You ever see Interstellar? You should, M.M. is quite the hunk!</p>

<p>You&#39;re talking circles around yourself.</p>

<p>We CANNOT travel faster than light by <strong>conventional means</strong>. If there is a way to travel faster than light (I&#39;m not calling it impossible) then aliens would easily be able to head to the next empty planet instead of bothering with us.</p>

<p>The point is that they could just harvest other asteroids or lifeless planets.

<p>What you are describing sounds more like Mars. If you google &quot;Life on Mars eradicated by nuclear weapons&quot;, you&#39;ll get some info about a physicist who recently put all the evidence together.</p>

<p>There could very well have been life on Venus millions of years ago though. I do not profess to know everything about every alien race ever. It just seems like if we had other races so close, they would be more involved with various things.</p>

<p>If you happen to come across any more info on them, please let me know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The alien question is fascinating because you can come at it from so many different angles, and still end up with nothing.  Almost anything you see or experience can be explained by advanced technology or psychological phenomena.  There is plenty of weirdness in religious and political history.  But, given the central role of manipulation in human civilization, that&#39;s not likely to be reliable evidence.</p>

<p>The one thing that always gives me pause, though, is the Fermi paradox.  It&#39;s just not likely that space is empty or that vast distances are impossible to overcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the most compelling evidence is The Star Child Skull. A skull that looks much like you&#39;d expect from an small alien grey, with DNA that cannot be explained. There is also a ton if misinfo and disinfo spread about it. Lloyd Pye mysteriously died of hyper-aggressive (weaponized) cancer right before making a full disclosure. </p>

<p>Billy Meier with his discovery of the Talmud of Jmmanuel, and his predictions concerning celestial bodies that we didn&#39;t have the technology to detect until years later. The Thulium. etc etc. Billy Meier has a lot of compelling evidence. </p>

<p>And again, you can be sure that there is some truth to it based on how much disinfo is spread about it.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s things like Phil Schneider and the Deep Underground Military Bases.</p>

<p>Graham Hancock and John Anthony West have also done a lot of research on ancient civilizations and their relationship with E.T.s.</p>

<p>Things like the pyramids that are perfectly lined up with constellations on the equinox in 10,500 BC.</p>

<p>You can take any one piece of evidence and try to dismiss it, but there is no way to dismiss all the evidence, especially when it is all pointing to the same thing.</p>

<p>I read some of the Billy Meier / Talmud of Jmmanuel stuff, and it seems just speculation and invention.  I don&#39;t see any solid evidence there that has withstood real, independent examination.</p>

<p>Why should it have been impossible for ancient Egyptians to line up pyramids with the stars ?  They were a very successful civilization for thousands of years, had great organization and good technology in military, irrigation, construction, etc.</p>

<p>As far as &quot;there is no way to dismiss all the evidence&quot;, this is just an attempt to reverse the burden of proof.  You are making an extraordinary claim, the burden is on you to provide extraordinary evidence.  Instead, you are throwing a bunch of half-baked stuff at us, and saying we have to disprove it.</p>

<p>It is just as conceivable and plausibke for &quot;extraterrestrials&quot; to actuslly be from another branch of hominds thst eveolved seperately from homo sapiens.</p>

<p>For instance, there are the chimpanzees and the bonobo. Almkst exactly alike, except for their psychology.</p>

<p>The chimps evolved through a world of competition, which means natural selection chose the most powerful and agressive specimens to carry on to their progeny. This means that selfishness and greed and success through anothers downfall. Sounds fairly human-like, dont it?</p>

<p>Then there is the bonobos. They succeeded through mutual beneficisl actions. They helped eachother. They survived and evolved by being empathetic, sympathetic, selfless, and helpful. Sounds like the gods of religions and their angels, dont it? (An argument could be made thst this also sounds human-like. But this woukd almost imply thst humans somehow are a crossbreed of bonobo and chimps, but evolved with some different genetics sometime down the road....)</p>

<p>Point is, they dont have to originate from anywhere else but earth to maintain logical sense. In fact, i tend to believe &quot;aliens&quot; are just at home on earth as we are...</p>
