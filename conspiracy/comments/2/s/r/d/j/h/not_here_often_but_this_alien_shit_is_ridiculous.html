        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So the Canadian ex-defense minister claims aliens exist now!</p>

<p>Here&#39;s that:
<a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2014/01/06/at-least-4-known-alien-species-have-been-visiting-earth-for-thousands-of-years-x-canadian-defence-minister-continues-to-blow-the-whistle/">http://www.collective-evolution.com/2014/01/06/at-least-4-known-alien-species-have-been-visiting-earth-for-thousands-of-years-x-canadian-defence-minister-continues-to-blow-the-whistle/</a></p>

<p>Also, William Cooper claimed years and years ago that they would use a false alien attack to force us into a one world government, under the assumption that we will be protected. He claimed that the only reason they haven&#39;t presented us with an alien is because they didn&#39;t have the technology to make us believe it is real.</p>

<p>This is William Cooper&#39;s broadcast BACK IN 1998:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9ke0UmXh7U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9ke0UmXh7U</a></p>

<p>Now, lets go back. The Canadian ex-defense minister is claiming that there are 4 different species of aliens that have been visiting earth for centuries! And one species happens to look just like us! We wouldn&#39;t be able to tell if one was standing right beside us.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION: Aliens are bullshit. It&#39;s not as if they -can&#39;t- exist, but the ones being presented to us certainly do not.</p>

<p>I was denouncing the statements Paul Hellyer said specifically, not the fact that they could have visited Earth.
I agree with you 100%
I ALSO believe that if they have the superior technology necessary to travel through the galaxy, that they would also be able to cloak themselves from us. Knowing this, I can assume that many UFO sitings are not in fact extraterrestrials, but man made.
Again, I say many, not all.</p>

<p>Depends. When you do enough research, there is some convincing evidence that we actually are genetic descendants of some races of extraterrestrials. Without saying whether or not this is the case, i find some of these theories to be fantastically convincing. But, some races of extraterrestrials seem a bit out of place in reality and in lifes standards, in general. But, im no biologist. </p>

I think HE believes that no aliens exist, but as we learn more about space and realize just how big it is, it is ignorant to say that they do not exist AT ALL, considering some scientists are now claiming that in every supermassive black hole -an entire other universe- could exist, and that there is a supermassive black hole in nearly every galaxy, and there are a hundred billion galaxies.

    <div class="md"><p>I guess i need to look into this pauls claims. Until i do, take this for what its worth..</p>

<p>As for the ones that look just like us, i feel that makes mkre sense. We literally know next to nothing of human culture in the antediluvial times. So much has been destroyed by time and nsture itself (it only takes a few thousand years, and most, if not all, of our current society woukd be completely gone without s trace), and the records thereof destroyed by our own hands.</p>

<p>So, i speculate thst there could be another line of humans, or an ancient society thst was more advanced, who escaped thd flood. Maybe they dug underground, lost pigment in their skin and grew larger eyes to accomodste the lack of sunlight to resemble the greys, or maybe they moved into orbit for awhile, and kept to themselves as the survivors evolved naturally, and intervened when necessary.</p>

<p>For this last scenario, these &quot;extraterrestrials&quot; would actuslly still be humans, but slightly different, depending on other vsriabkes, particularily time. But this coukd be why they would look like us --- because they <em>are</em> us... (Or we are them, whichever way you wanna look at it)...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. That is actually really interesting and something I didn&#39;t think about before. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I certainly entertain the idea of aliens (and what you&#39;re referring to) existing. </p>

<p>I also strongly believe that there are plans being laid out to control the masses, and that plan involves a large threat. One in which we all need to gather and rely on the elite to save us from. In turn, creating a one world government.</p>

<p>A perfect threat to all of us would be extraterrestrials. SO, they would very much like if we believed in aliens and the ability to space travel.</p>

<p>My point is not at all that they can&#39;t exist, but that the fact that they could is being used as a manipulation tactic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats very plausible, imo. If it came to such measures, i would presume that TPTB woukd be so incredibly desperate at this point to maintain their status quo.  Itd be like their last resort effort to maintain power and control..  do you have any supporting evidence or anything that we can dissect and analyze?

</blockquote>

<p>There is also analysis of our genome that shows we have about 223 genes that are not found anywhere else in the animal kingdom, and all have arised at (geneologically speaking) at the same time and over night. This brings researchers to discuss lateral gene transfer from microbes, as those microbes are the only ones that share some 40-ish genes out of the 223 that im talking about.</p>

<p>Yet, many researchers are not even close to being convinced such lateral gene transfer has occured in our history. This, however, leads them to a dead end because they dont have a real explanation for this. </p>

<p>Its actually been quite awhile since ive had this sort of discussion. But essentially, it is plausible (im not saying this is the case, jist thst it is plausible) for extraterrestrials to have come and genetically modified an existing hominid on earth. This would allow for the mostly terrestrial genomes, but also explains the many genes that dont have explanations, and that cant really (at least yet) be explained logically through the theory of evolution. </p>

<p>Thus, i cannot throw an extraterrestrial origin out just yet.</p>

<p>This is good, because they realise that &quot;We don&#39;t know&quot; is an acceptable response.</p>

<p>Also, if you think about it, how likely would it be that alien life would be even remotely like ourselves? They probably don&#39;t even use DNA, but something equally novel.</p>

<p>Main reasons why this is the case - </p>

<ul>
<li><p>All three videos submitted to Youtube anonymously.</p></li>
<li><p>The Dome of the Rock is one of the most famous and important religious sites in the world, and there are well over a million people in Jerusalem at any given time—many of them religious tourists near the Temple Mount. It&#39;s probable that there were thousands of people in the area at the time, yet no one else reported seeing or videotaping the bright light?</p></li>
<li><p>Effects of the video processing software are clearly seen. The hoaxer used Motion Tile effects with edge mirroring to introduce camera shake into the video. You can see the mirroring effects along the edge of the video. This proves that the video did not go directly from the camera to YouTube, that it made a stop in between inside a sophisticated video editing software suite.</p></li>
<li><p>Incredibly bright UFO doesn&#39;t have a reflection on the Dome.</p></li>

<p>This seems to be the best link I could find on the subject.</p>

<p>To clarify for readers, airport officials closed down the airport for an hour whilst they decided if it was a problem to aircraft safety or not, then resumed as normal.</p>

<p>Other photos that don&#39;t look like this video appear to be people submitting long exposure shots of planes for a bit of fame, and shouldn&#39;t be taken seriously. I doubt you&#39;d think much of them either once you&#39;ve seen them!</p>

<p>Also, this guy seems to have a very technical approach of identifying it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s safe to say that there are some creative liberties being taken with his interpretation or UFO&#39;s. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if the footage they show during his Muskoka segment is related at all to his story, but it should be made clear that the video shows a spotlight with an animated lens. These things are very popular, especially in cottage country, around bars and events. </p>

<p>An idea William Cooper presents is that they will use religion (along with everything else) to carry out their plan, so it&#39;s interesting that Paul Hellyer slipped that in there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a half dozen airports in that area; local and international. There are blast furnaces on the Hamilton side that occasionally burn magnesium (which causes beams of light to shoot across the sky.) There are military bases along both sides of the lake that often land helicopters and use massive portable spot lights. In the GTA (and the Golden Horseshoe) there are literally dozens of bars that use projectors and animated spot lights for events. Also many stores rent them for grand openings. Festivals use them as well. 
The shores of Lake Ontario have fireworks throughout the summer and the boats on the lake frequently deploy flares and rockets during training exercises...</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say, categorically, that you didn&#39;t see an alien craft, but the likelihood of you mistaking an easily explained set of lights vs. it being otherworldly is rather high. Especially if you&#39;re on the Burlington Skyway. </p>

I ALSO believe that if they have the superior technology necessary to travel through the galaxy, that they would also be able to cloak themselves from us. Knowing this, I can assume that many UFO sitings are not in fact extraterrestrials, but man made.
