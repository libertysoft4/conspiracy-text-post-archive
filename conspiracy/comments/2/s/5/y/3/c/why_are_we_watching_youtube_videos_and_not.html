<p>When do we assemble? When do we become an organized group that assembles logical information that can be easily digestible to someone completely unfamiliar with the depth of the world politics facade?

<p>We need a media team. People making attractive, logical, non-offensive flyers. We should be burning DVDs and CDs and leave them in laundry mats, at bus stops, in cafes. WE SHOULD DO WHAT THE BIBLE THUMPERS DO, offering free food with some conversation and literature. </p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t we creating a massive petition campaign against CISPA? Are you afraid of using the White House petition site? WHY?! </p>

<p>This is a part of why it&#39;s hard to organize things.</p>

<p>Because the only things you talk about being &quot;organized&quot; and &quot;political&quot; are exactly the things the media have been manipulating for us to feel outraged about all along.</p>

This is a liberal - sociological pedigree but together we need to take action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They make false conflict in humanity like religion(you said &quot;bible thumpers&quot;, so Mr-You is ,maybe implying you have fallen for this false conflict).  There are other divisions like race, political party, Cops vs Protesters, divisions within political movements that are constructed ways to divide, and keep the people down.  If you think about it, by saying &quot;bible thumper&quot;, you just alienated a few billion people that maybe would have otherwise helped your cause.  Tons of people who believe in the bible are also aware, and opposed to things like the IMF, and Federal Reserve.  Just because they have SOME differences in belief does not mean we cannot come together for the things we agree on(and in fact, it is necessary).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What, exactly, do you expect to &quot;organize&quot; around? Do you think everybody on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> believes the same thing?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to stand next to some dude that wants to print fliers about chemtrails, he doesn&#39;t want to have to deal with some dude&#39;s anti-vax preaching, the anti-vax dude wants nothing to do with the holocaust denier, who in turn doesn&#39;t want to deal with anarcho-capitalists shouting about bitcoin...</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a single-issue sub, or even an umbrella sub. This is a sub dedicated with hundreds of opinions and issues that simply cannot work together. </p>

<p>I mean, can you name a single issue everybody here will agree with and rally behind?</p>

<p>If you want to get more specific and say &quot;we anti-CISPA people need to organize,&quot; that&#39;s fine. But that&#39;s probably not even half of the people here. It might only be a tiny fraction.</p>

<p>So I ask you: &quot;Why haven&#39;t you gotten together with like-minded people already?&quot; Other people have. What&#39;s stopping you, and why do you assume everybody else is inside watching videos and not out on the streets, anyways? A lot of people are actually activists and researchers and public speakers. You could be one too, if you wanted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t avoid me forever!</p>

<p>I&#39;d just like you to look at a nice, safe, government web site before writing off chemtrails entirely:</p>

<p><a href="http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19680002906">http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19680002906</a></p>

<p>Page five has the first mention of &quot;chemtrails&quot; though they obviously aren&#39;t called this. </p>

<p>And one, very non-revisionist, article published by the Center for holocaust and genocide studies at the university of Minnesota:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chgs.umn.edu/museum/memorials/auschBirkMem/index.html">http://www.chgs.umn.edu/museum/memorials/auschBirkMem/index.html</a></p>

<p>With the pertinent text being:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The memorial, too, has changed throughout the years. The plaques indicating that &quot;4 million people&quot; were killed at Auschwitz were removed in 1990. They were replaced with plaques stating the more accurate figure of “one and a half million.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one &quot;denies&quot; the holocaust, they argue about the historical validity of the details.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Missed your pertinent text there. I&#39;ll be reading later.  I dabble in most theories.  Go engineering is a thing I know there have indeed literally been Chem trails.   It is the scope of the deployment I question.</p>

<p>As for the Holocaust...  AFAIK it indeed occurred, may be embellished and the worst starvation was probably a result of Germany losing the war, but I prefer to avoid it as a topic because needing to rub elbows with outright deniers really just makes me sick.  It is milked too much for sympathy and not enough as an object lesson about creeping hatred in society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry I&#39;m on an ipad so any post with links takes several edits, I think I&#39;m done now.</p>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t think there are any outright deniers, it&#39;s prejorative term used to shut down debate.</p>

<p>If someone claimed (for sake of argument) that Niel Armstrong never went to the moon, but the rest of the astronauts did, is he denying the moon landing?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Probably a wise stance, but you&#39;d be amazed how many people are totally unaccepting, even of government sources (incidentally, the best sources to make pro-vaxxers head explode from cognitive dissonance).</p>

<p>I had a guy get mad at me once for mentioning crop dusting (which I only did because he denied there ever was or ever will be a chemtrail).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OF COURSE very many Jews died in the work camps, but at least 90% of the deaths were due to typhus and unsanitary conditions as the German supply lines went down. It&#39;s been proven that there were NO gas chambers. Think about it...if you witnessed one you wouldn&#39;t have lived through it as the &quot;supposed&quot; gas chambers would have killed every person that was within a few hundred feet AND would have killed anyone that handled the bodies not long after the &quot;gassings&quot; as the myth says they did. Hell, they wouldn&#39;t even work at all as gas chambers without hermetically sealed doors and sparkproof lighting as HCl gas is EXTREMELY flammable and leaves blue, permanent stains on the walls...instead they show cheap, gas-leaking wood doors that open INWARD and no blue stains. When I went to Auchwitz it was SO obviously fake. You can even see where the partitions were in the original room before it was &quot;faked&quot; into a &quot;gas chamber.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s also been proven that it would have taken a crematoria many. many years and LOTS of fuel to burn all those bodies...the math just doesn&#39;t add up.</p>

<p>Think about it: German men were off to war and SOMEBODY needed to build the weapons...the camps are where Jewish, Italian, Gypsies, and POWs were taken and made to work.</p>

<p>The Germans did NOT want to lose their work force and, before the supply lines broke down, took rather good care of the Jews. Auschwitz had a library, a swimming pool, an orchestra, a theater, showed films (mostly propaganda)...even a camp brothel!</p>

<p>The holocaust is nothing but a money grab. Sure many Jews died (around 300,000 according to the Red Cross) and this is UNACCEPTABLE...but many more Americans died fighting for our freedom. And Stalin made Hitler look like a choirboy. Now it&#39;s all about taking &quot;reparations&quot; from Germany...still...70+ years later.</p>

<p>What else is new? All I know is that <strong>I</strong> don&#39;t want to be ejected from my country (us Jews have been expelled from, what now, 120 or so countries since 1AD?) because of the monkey business of a few Ashkenazi assholes who like to steal and gamble with other people&#39;s money and claim reparations from events that didn&#39;t even come close to happening (like the electric floors, geysers of blood, and <em>impossible</em> open-pit cremations)...among <em>thousands</em> of other lies.</p>

<p>Because despite what you see here, a vast majority of the population don&#39;t give a shit. They&#39;ve been so sensitized to <em>terrorism</em> that they don&#39;t know what&#39;s what. They don&#39;t ask for sources. They don&#39;t care at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because no one wants to get beat, arrested, lose their job, and get followed by government minders? Or killed.</p>

<p>Because the Media doesn&#39;t cover protests it doesn&#39;t agree with?</p>

<p>Because the American people don&#39;t give a shit about protest?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a dangerous time to be an activist. The internet is an excellent tool for subverting the status quo, and perhaps one of the few effective ones left. We are up against The Media, primarily - fighting for the hearts and minds of the people, to steal their weasel wording. If you try to fight The Media in the streets, they will just cut you out of the conversation and create their own. On the internet, you have a better chance of being heard. </p>

<p>If you think people aren&#39;t paying attention to the internet... well, YOU&#39;RE here, aren&#39;t you?</p>

<p>Keep fighting. ON and Offline. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really difficult to rally around a common goal when everyone in a country has a different goal and agenda and belief system. That&#39;s why nationalism was killed in the first place. It was too dangerous to the industrialists and politicians.</p>

<p>The only way to make a difference is to do it one country at a time. You need to be able to hold those within the country accountable by closing these neo-liberal borders and regaining control over the political structure including the monetary system and removing the internationalist from the equation. They are why the world is in the gutter. Only when you can get your country back to being a nation and not an outlet or home base for international, criminal behavior can you begin to not only solve your own problems, but the world&#39;s problems.</p>

<p>The problem is that the world went through a massive campaign of propaganda, misinformation and brainwashing as well as an injection of people and cultures that do not line up. People were taught that individualism is better than community and that tolerating everything means a better lifestyle. Unfortunately this has lead to the ability of higher powers to use terrorism to push people in different and foreign directions. They&#39;ve been pitted against each other in the competitive world of capitalism disguised under Bolshevism. They&#39;ve accepted that they are on their own and that things like feminism, racism and other minor things in the West are more important than the fact that the Western governments are still proponents of violence, slavery and crimes against its own citizens.</p>

<p>To unite the people of a country in the West would be quite a feat. Western countries used to be the most powerful on Earth. They were the fastest growing in intellect and in national pride and duty but that was destroyed with WW2 and the lies that occurred to establish a new world environment.</p>

<p>The task is very big. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s impossible but there is a lot to be done to reverse the damage of the last 100 years. The fact is, white Europeans still make up a large majority in their own lands (for now), but they are all too scared to say anything or to do anything to help their communities and to provide a better environment for their children. They&#39;ve been turned into cowards and turned against their own blood to be sensitive to the people who will eventual destroy them and the way of life their ancestors fought for. Everyone has respect for everyone but themselves. To turn it around, we need people to realize they are worth something again and that individuals are wonderful but individualism is causing a rift between people and their communities and the people they should be caring about. People won&#39;t defend what they don&#39;t have. And right now, they don&#39;t have anything but themselves and the beliefs they were taught.</p>

<p>So, watching YouTube videos isn&#39;t motivating resistance, but you suggest making more of them.</p>

<p>Great irony in your presentation.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the simple truth here is that the power structure prevents any single person from emerging to lead any sort of meaningful resistance. Not only that, but it is now also prepared and practiced at quelling any form of spontaneous group resistance thanks to the failed Occupy movement.</p>

<p>Unlike those who have taken control of the world, ... We don&#39;t infiltrate. We don&#39;t undermine. We don&#39;t bribe. We don&#39;t assassinate. We basically do nothing but acquiesce to the status quo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But in order to watch YouTube videos, there must be people who made them. So there are people who do more than just watch them.
Also watching them makes people share them,  which spreads an idea that &#39;they&#39; don&#39;t want us to have. Even if only a few get it, those few may be all that matter.
In psychology [keeping ideas, memes alive], there are tellers, spreaders and doers. All three are just as important as each other.</p>

<p>Tellers are those that tell a good tale, know how to get it across, can make websites and know their media.</p>

<p>Spreaders are those that know a lot of people and spread these ideas.</p>

<p>Doers are those that are not really interested in the above [does&#39;t exclude them though] but are very good at taking action and are not afraid of the consequences.</p>

<p>All are needed!</p>

<p>If you want it to happen, you have to do it yourself.  You have to go <em>make</em> it happen.  That is how it works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Freedom of assembly was quietly done away with, blocking traffic is terrorism.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a car based society, in hitchiker&#39;s guide ford prefect thought cars were the dominant lifeform...that&#39;s a very insightful point that we should all keep in mind. </p>

<p>There is no place in an american city for people to gather because they&#39;d have to get there with cars and there would be no place to put those cars, so basically going to a protest is such a huge risk of your car getting towed and since only people for whom 500 buck tow charges are a lot of money would want to protest anyway....</p>

<p>The car centric culture&#39;s side-effect of limiting mass demonstration is going to be something that is historically going to be calculated into what is going on right now.  It&#39;s a form of chains, having to buy fuel, having to buy tires, having to buy insurance, having to wait in traffic, having to find parking, have a car loan, these things are all counter-revolutionary in a big way.  </p>

<p>Cars can give you freedom, but they can also trap you in a hundred ways.  </p>

<p>But what mr-you said is also true, if you listen between the lines, everything that would be required for organizing politically is psychically discouraged on CNN et al.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.crimethinc.org">www.crimethinc.org</a> and <a href="http://www.striketheroot.org">www.striketheroot.org</a> are who I am ready to organize with, none of this will be changed ever unless we can get our congress back from the highest bidder.  And I only see &#39;representatives&#39; as a necessary evil to a more direct system of democracy, which the internet is more than capable of providing with the help of strong crypto.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two points:</p>

<p>1) You can be the change you want to see. Think we should be offering food to people, along with the truth? Then host dinner parties where the theme of the evening is &#39;alternative opinions&#39;. Anybody who turns up is at least likely to hear you out. Think we should be handing out dvds? Then burn a heap and hand them out yourself when shopping, catching the bus, etc etc. One man can make a difference to those around him.</p>

<p>2) People <em>are</em> doing media work collaboratively. See &#39;We Need To Talk About Sandy Hook&#39;. See <a href="https://vid.me/VSI7">WDIL</a>, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCclKyWsEtyj2tIbczsB17-A">MaxResistance Roundtable</a>, or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEMRHeEX8KJaK-9Jk0-u0jQ">Australian Roundtable</a>.</p>

<p>The changes you want to see happen gradually then suddenly. Have faith.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just today I learned an interesting lesson from my cello teacher. She said your mind makes sense of the music at least five times quicker then your physical body does. Meaning even though we can think and understand what we are supposed to be doing our bodies are always behind the curve trying to catch up. </p>

<p>Maybe there&#39;s a connection here. Maybe we are just in the learning/understanding phase on a mental level and we&#39;ve yet to take any steps physically to manifest the new reality we seem to be steering towards.</p>

<p>For me personally I haven&#39;t got into any of the activist groups because I don&#39;t have the time or means to dedicate myself to any cause. I am however trying to start a band so I can show my resistance to the system through my music. For now that&#39;s all I can do. </p>

<p>I think we&#39;ll know when the time is right to hit the streets. For now I&#39;d rather keep a low profile so as not to become chowder for the pigs.</p>

<p>I just want to share a clip that keeps me orientated when I start to stray:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s called apathy, my friend.</p>

<p>That, coupled with the fact that Amerikka is now a full-on police state, scares a lot of people away from protesting ANYTHING and the pigs will do nearly ANYTHING to get you into a for-profit privatized prison. There are FAR more prisons in the US than there are colleges at this point!</p>

<p>A coordinated, armed revolt attended by MILLIONS would be the only way that a &quot;protest&quot; outside of a &quot;free speech zone&quot; could work. It&#39;s not like I&#39;d mind seeing some bad pigs wiped out.</p>

<p>Emotions are never a good advidsor. You just get trapped in infiltrated groups where the leaders are helping your enemies and you have to compromise and get send in the wrong direction.</p>
