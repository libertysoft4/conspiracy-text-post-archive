It seems like momentum was building with these stories, and now all of the sudden nothing. It seems like there is a complete media blackout. The massacre in France completely took over the news cycle. There needs to be a concerted effort to put these stories back in the forefront. The names of those involved in these horrendous acts need to be publicized as widely as possible.</p>

<p>No one is arguing that blanks don&#39;t cause recoil. The fact of the matter is IF THEY ARE USING BLANKS ITS A FALSE FLAG. It&#39;s obvious they are using blanks if you actually watch the video and have ANY CONCEPT of the power of 7.62 impacting a human head/concrete. You can see the dust puff from where the paper cartridge was ejected, had it been an actual killshot, or simply a missed shot, it would have looked far different. Any amateur that has fired an ak47 could tell you that.</p>

<p>No speculation, the marks on the ground showing where to stop the car are obvious, but the &quot;killshot&quot; is the most glaring point. </p>

<p>Keeps getting removed all over the web, for good reason:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDIXuxJrEtw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDIXuxJrEtw</a></p>

<p>If you understand the power of an AK round, you realize that this was faked.</p>

<p>Two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>If it actually hit the man, there would be blood at that range. Anyone saying otherwise is simply delusional, or intentionally lying.</li>
<li>It&#39;s obviously a blank anyways, because of the dust puff that hits the ground about a foot away from the man&#39;s head. If a real round had impacted at that distance there would have been chunks of sidewalk blown up as well. All we see is a very slight puff from the paper from the blank round hitting the sidewalk. </li>

<p>Not really, depends on a lot of things. Angle, where he was shot. Besides, the video isn&#39;t long enough to see blood pool. Not all headshots are alike. </p>

<p>LOL paper projectiles? Do you even know how blanks work? The concrete is more than 5 feet away from him, blanks do not shoot out that far. You would have to be right up against the concrete like 3 inches away to even leave a mark. </p>

<p>LOL paper projectiles? Do you even know how blanks work? The concrete is more than 5 feet away from him, blanks do not shoot out that far. You would have to be right up against the concrete like 3 inches away to even leave a mark.</p>

<p>This just shows you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about. The video you linked shows 5.56 rounds, which have much less powder/power than a blank AK round would. </p>

<p>Nope, you are clearly wrong, like I said it depends on exactly where he was shot. Don&#39;t know you about anatomy? Depends on if he hit an artery or not. Not all gun shots spurt blood. </p>

<p>LOL you said paper projectile! Don&#39;t back out now doofy! 
You don&#39;t know anything about blank bullets, not one thing.
You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. I would bet you have never even fired a gun.</p>

<p>So please stop making foolish arguments, you are not an expert. </p>

<p>Nah, you won&#39;t get that many supporters arguing it&#39;s not a false flag at this point (considering all the evidence it is) unless it hits frontpage and gets main exposure, then all the masses will come in and upvote you.
