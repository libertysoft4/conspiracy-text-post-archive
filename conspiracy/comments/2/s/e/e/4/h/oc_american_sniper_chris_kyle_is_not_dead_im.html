        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Every year for work, my colleagues and I take a trip overseas.  On our return flight back to the US, we had a somewhat unique experience.</p>

<p>The first thing that happened when we got to the ticket counter was the airline was offering us $1000 to give up our tickets and take the next day&#39;s flight.  After a lot of joking around about if our wives would be more mad that we turned down the $1000 or if we came back a day later, all of us decided to take the flight.</p>

<p>I was on an outside row in a window-seat.  A big man with a beard and the ends of the mustached part twirled up sat down next to me.  Then he opened up an egg sandwich and ate it.  I figured he was some Bavarian bumpkin or something.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t remember how the conversation started, but he ended up being an American.  I asked him what he did for a living and he said he was a &quot;contractor for the military&quot;.  I think most people just hear that and assume that he installs infrastructure for the military or something, but I&#39;ve spent a good portion of my free time over several years attempting to learn as much as I can about the secretive side of government.  </p>

<p>I asked him, &quot;You said contractor.  Does that mean what I think it means?&quot;  </p>

<p>He responded with &quot;I&#39;m in a JSOC unit for Lockheed Martin.&quot;</p>

<p>After that, we had a conversation that lasted for about 3 hours.  During this time he intimated that he had access to a lot of classified information that he couldn&#39;t tell me about when discussing various subjects.  He assured me that he wouldn&#39;t tell me anything that would get him, or myself, in any trouble.</p>

<p>That said, I want to make this very clear:  He in no way shape or form confirmed or denied the story.  His reaction, however, was peculiar to say the least.</p>

<p>So after about an hour of talking with him about various things, I brought up the whole &quot;Seal Team 6&quot; (now referred to as ST6) storyline.  The official story goes as follows:  </p>

<p>ST6 went in and killed Bin Laden at a compound in Abbattabad, Pakistan.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Osama_bin_Laden">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Osama_bin_Laden</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Osama bin Laden, the founder and head of the Islamist militant group al-Qaeda, was killed in Pakistan on May 2, 2011, shortly after 1:00 am PKT[1][2] (20:00 UTC, May 1) by U.S. Navy SEALs of the U.S. Naval Special Warfare Development Group (also known as DEVGRU or SEAL Team Six). The operation, code-named Operation Neptune Spear, was carried out in a Central Intelligence Agency-led operation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then Joe Biden made a mistake and ran his mouth off about who carried out the raid.  This means that individuals can be identified who know the truth about what actually happened.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/aug/9/kuhner-who-betrayed-navy-seal-team-6/">http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/aug/9/kuhner-who-betrayed-navy-seal-team-6/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Several days after the bin Laden operation, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. — in a pathetic attempt to spike the football and gloat — publicly revealed their central role in the raid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, conveniently for those who would not want the truth about the operation to come out, the claim is that the members of ST6 were killed in an ambush.  Reportedly, they were flying in a chinook and a rocket launcher took them all out.  There were also suspicious circumstances around this incident.</p>

<p>From the same source above:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What really happened to Navy SEAL Team 6? In August 2011, the elite special forces unit suffered the worst battlefield calamity in its history. A Taliban fighter shot down a Chinook helicopter carrying 22 Navy SEAL Team 6 members in Afghanistan. All 38 persons on board — the Navy SEAL warriors, other U.S. military personnel and seven Afghan soldiers — were killed. Grieving family members have been demanding answers. They may now get some as Congress finally opens an investigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/20/families-suspect-seal-team-6-crash-was-inside-job-/?page=all">http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/20/families-suspect-seal-team-6-crash-was-inside-job-/?page=all</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Families suspect SEAL Team 6 crash was inside job on worst day in Afghanistan</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, we are supposed to believe, Chris Kyle was shot in an accident with a 25 year old with PTSD.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/03/sniper-chris-kyle-shot-dead">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/03/sniper-chris-kyle-shot-dead</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Former Navy Seal sniper Chris Kyle shot dead at Texas gun range </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would, of course, wrap up any  &quot;loose ends&quot; about ST6.</p>

<p>Now, going back to the beginning of the conversation with the man on the plane, when I brought the subject up, his initial reaction was &quot;Aww man.  I can&#39;t really talk about that.  I knew all those guys and it&#39;s too close.&quot;</p>

<p>I told him, &quot;That&#39;s fine.  I know you can&#39;t say anything about it and I don&#39;t expect you to.  I just want to say what I think happened.&quot;  He had no problem with that and showed no emotion about it.</p>

<p>So I got to the end of my explanation and the exact words were &quot;The thing I don&#39;t know is if those guys are really dead-&quot;</p>

<p>Then he very casually and flippantly interrupted me with &quot;- or if they have just been reshuffled.&quot;  Then we just kinda looked at each other.  I said &quot;Yeah.&quot; Then, we moved on.</p>

<p>It was very clear by the way the word &quot;reshuffled&quot; came to him that it is a common term in his industry for creating a new identity for someone.  Once again, he obviously did not confirm this, but the whole thing stinks and I wish the readers here could have been in my shoes and experienced the tone and ease with which he said &quot;or if they have just been reshuffled&quot; with concerning his supposedly dead friends.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll be glad to answer any questions anyone may have about this.  I&#39;m just tired of all the lies.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There may be more to it that I am missing.  I can certainly be open to that as a probability more than just a possibility.</p>

<p>Upon reading more about Kyle, in particular, it appears there was also some controversy over the truthfulness of his book.  However, this would still not take away from the fact that the publicity made Kyle a known entity who could confirm or deny what he knows about the situation.  He clearly posed a potential problem.</p>

<p>So do you have something other to say that contributes to the conversation other than you think that I am a sucker?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was identified as among those who were involved in the bin laden raid.  Whether we call them Seal Team or DEVGRU is really inconsequential. So what are you trying to get at?</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty well known and documented what has happened.  There are plenty of links in the OP.</p>

<p><a href="http://nation.time.com/2011/05/13/the-outing-of-the-seals-has-secdef-ticked-off/">http://nation.time.com/2011/05/13/the-outing-of-the-seals-has-secdef-ticked-off/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Later the same day, May 3, Vice President Joe Biden let the cat out of the bag. While the press had been reporting SEAL Team 6 carried out the mission, no one in government had confirmed that fact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this is exactly what Biden said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me briefly acknowledge tonight’s distinguished honorees.  Admiral James Stavridis is a, is the real deal. He can tell you more about and understands the incredible, the phenomenal, the just almost unbelievable capacity of his Navy SEALs and what they did last Sunday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it would appear that Biden identified the seals and the press ran with the Team 6.  I don&#39;t see that this detail about which number would change anything.  Kyle was a known associate and, thus, another &quot;loose end&quot; to be tied up.  I reckon there is probably more to the story that has not been figured out yet.</p>

<p>Who knows for sure?  They could be &quot;reshuffled&quot; for completely different and unrelated circumstances.  I just don&#39;t buy this bullcrap.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Though a trained member of the SEALs — the elite unit which  conducted the raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound in 2011 — Kyle was still not yet an authorised sniper when, borrowing his unit commander’s rifle, he made his first ‘kill’ in March 2003, just two weeks into the conflict in Iraq. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe you are correct?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two previous evaluations had recommended Kyle for SEAL Team Six, the unit that later killed Osama bin Laden, and Kyle had received two Silver Stars for his achievements in combat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So whether Chris Kyle has become &quot;mixed up&quot; by the media with the actual team 6 members or whether he was actually there is very unclear.  As you can see from the first quote, he is identified as someone who would be &quot;in the know&quot; about the situation.  This still makes him a known entity and loose-end.  I think we can agree that you don&#39;t want these guys to be identified.  Furthermore, there really isn&#39;t a way for us to verify who actually did what, which is why Biden&#39;s statement caused such a problem in the first place.  Still seems very clear that he was a known loose end from all the coverage he got.</p>

<p>Interesting though... I&#39;ll look into it more.</p>

<p>I did not say that.  Perhaps you should read exactly what I wrote:</p>

<p>We spent a good half-hour talking about hunting too.  At least put a little more effort into building a better strawman than &quot;OMG A STRANGER WOULDN&quot;T DUMP CLASSIFIED INFO!&quot;...  because I never claimed that he did.</p>

<p>At least take the time to read and comprehend before you make a lame attempt at discrediting me.</p>

<p>To give you an example, the 9/11 subject came up and he didn&#39;t tell me anything other than &quot;There were communications problems.&quot;  That&#39;s not revealing classified info, either.</p>

<p>what would you tell to the rest of the family?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that, by this time, their family would kinda know what their occupation is.  Not only that, but these guys were (whether all of this was real or not) put in danger by Joe Biden&#39;s huge gaffe of identifying them.</p>

<p>When put to a choice of a husband with a target on his back that endangers not only himself, but his family or getting a new identity and relocating, I think most wives and family members would be pretty darn understanding about the situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wouldnt they just relocate him AND his family using traditional relocation means? Ive never heard of someone putting their kids through the trauma of thinking their dad is dead - when they could just as easily come up with a fake identity for the whole family, like in every other case</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a way, honestly, I feel bad for a person like that.  He probably thinks he&#39;s &quot;in on it&quot; and understands the way the world works but in reality he&#39;s being completely misled and deceived and is literally nothing more than a tool of rich men who don&#39;t want to get their hands dirty, a hammer slamming down nails with no concept of what he&#39;s helping to build (or destroy) - to be discarded as soon as his usefulness is depleted.</p>

<p>But I feel a lot worse for all of those who brainwashed drones such as himself have killed and continue to kill with no real concept of why they&#39;re doing it other than that they were told to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I told him was what I told you above.</p>

<p>The simple TL;DR version is this:</p>

<p>The Bin Laden raid was a lie.  Biden slipped up and identified people who would be able to reveal that the raid was a lie.  This left them in the position of having to tie up these loose ends.  They had to be gone so they were either actually killed or just &quot;reshuffled&quot;.</p>

<p>Bragging about killing the enemy in iraq is one thing, hell a large number of military people do it. No pile of bodies with .308 holes in them was ever found in NOLA, and from what ive been able to find on him regarding Katrina is nothing but rumor or hearsay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it was empty bragging but anyone who would do this is an arrogant asshole. He said him and a friend did it and that he &#39;bagged&#39; 34 &#39;niggers&#39;  himself--plus the dozens of lies he told about Jesse Ventura. Jesse sued him and won IIRC. </p>

<p>The man was NOT a nice guy and arrogant as hell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Woah, this is weird as hell and I know it sounds crazy, but I&#39;m pretty sure I sat next to the same guy on my flight back from France a few months ago, twirly mustache and all.   We spoke for what seemed like the entire flight, but in reality was only about 2-3 hours.  He told me about 9/11, the Bilderbergs, JFK, HAARP, and before slipping on his headphones and dozing off for the reminder of the flight, he told me to be on the look out for a series of false flag operations later in the year.  It&#39;s amazing who you&#39;ll meet on airplanes these days!</p>
