<p>Is isn&#39;t anti-Semitic to point at crimes being committed by Jews, esp. when a very Jewish news media bends over backwards to keep evidence of same hidden from view.</p>

<p>Mossad agents caught celebrating as the towers fell (were you celebrating that day?)</p>

<p>Odigo the Israeli company with offices in the vicinity of WTC receiving advance notice.</p>

<p>Only one(!) Israeli dying in the towers when even Israeli media were estimating it would be in the hundreds if not thousands.</p>

<p>The van full of Israelis caught with evidence of explosives on the George Washington bridge that day.</p>

<p>Lucky Larry Silverstein!</p>

<p>A very Jewish news media in America vigorously bending over backwards to do everything it could to protect Israel from scrutiny, including, incredibly, omitting any mention of the 9-11 Commission Report&#39;s finding that it was U.S. support for Israeli atrocities committed upon Palestinians that inspired the attacks in the first place.</p>

<p>Or how about, the fact that Israel has committed false-flag attacks against America before, in Egypt (see Lavon Affair) and in international waters (see U.S.S. Liberty).  Or against our allies (see King David Hotel Bombing).</p>

<p>And it goes on.  But you do actually have to bother yourself to look, and accept as a consequence of investigation that the facts may lead you to a conclusion that you don&#39;t want to reach.</p>

<p>It is if you label them as &quot;Jews&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When so many act in unison it is irresponsible not to make that connection.  In any case, zionist has been used, racist Jew, Jewish supremacist... every kind of effort has been made to more correctly identify that group within Jewry responsible for engaging in these conspiracies, and always with the result of being labelled anti-Semitic in any case.</p>

<p>The correct solution here would be to speak truth to power and resolve these issues peacefully through dialogue.  Instead, a very Jewish news media works overtime at shutting down the conversation before it can even begin.</p>

<p>So it really doesn&#39;t matter what word is being used here.  It is the expectation of Jew that Jew should be able to exercise power without ever hearing mention of same, and that is unacceptable.</p>

<p>You too will soon be made to see that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t go 9 years without paying; I got a 9 year sentence.</p>

<p>Would you like to know how they arrived at 9 years? The gov&#39;t discovered that over a number of years, I had helped people file approximately 300 of Schiff&#39;s Zero Income Tax Returns. Many of them requested refunds, but very few ever received a refund.</p>

<p>The law says that if a person requests a refund to which he or she is not entitled, that amount is considered a &quot;loss&quot; to the gov&#39;t. So they added up all of the requested refunds in those 300 returns and it came to about $3.3 million. So it was deemed that I defrauded the gov&#39;t of $3.3 million. So they looked on their chart for the punishment under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines--9 years in prison! Talk about Alice-in-Wondrland!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you had not used government infrastructure, been involved in the economy heavily supported and regulated by the US government, and so forth... I would agree with you. Anyone who lives off grid and supports themselves apart from the governed society, within a state, should have no obligation to pay taxes. It would seem you are not one of those individuals. Furthermore, I think it is still allowable to dissent against how your tax money is spent, but to expect the government to not come down on you when going against rules laid forth, is irrational. Which is why the cases that make it in the media are people who are heavily armed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, it&#39;s like asking evidence showing pro wrestling is fake. to some people (mainstream) they&#39;ll say it&#39;s real and we (conspiracy-people) have no evidence showing anything contrary. i mean how can the entire federation be lying to us? all those wrestlers are just conspiring to fake matches. nooo.<br/>
but to people &#39;in the know&#39; they don&#39;t need evidence pro wrestling&#39;s fake, they just know.    </p>

<p>evidence is great, but a lot of times, it has to go on speculation alone because the evidence has been covered up. but those that have been following these guys for a long time know their signs. and when we see a sign and talk about it, people who aren&#39;t in the know just see it as crazy talk, and now those &#39;not-in-the-know&#39; people are the majority in this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s so difficult to explain this to the un-initiated. Go read tragedy and hope by carol quigly (clinton&#39;s mentor). It explains their plans right in there. The problem is most people can&#39;t read a 1000 page book, but since now i know you can, i&#39;m ok with telling you to read it. It&#39;s not faith based, it&#39;s just the average person can&#39;t comprehend thousands of pages of literature so i just say that becuase i know they&#39;ll never read it. </p>

<p>And if you get past that, read the stuff written by tavistock press on their plans for the coming centuries. It&#39;s a $16,000 collection though, so i doubt most people will buy it, but you can find bits and pieces online. This is why i don&#39;t have &#39;evidence&#39; --how would i expect someone to read 20,000 pages of evidence? You&#39;d have to read the whole thing to get the picture, so i just say faith-based because it&#39;s easier to understand.</p>

<p>Tavistock Institute specializes in writing books for world leaders, exclusively. They analyze mass social behavior and make suggestions on how to mold it for a &#39;civilized&#39; future society. Lots of one world government and globalization in there. They see it as helping us though, i don&#39;t think they think they&#39;re evil. They price the books really high and the books span tens of thousands of pages though, to keep them out of reach of the public. But it&#39;s all in there. They don&#39;t really &#39;hide&#39; anything, and their societies aren&#39;t really &#39;secret&#39;.</p>

<p>And hey, double bonus is you can answer any of those questions, I know a lot of companies that&#39;ll hire you tomorrow for $90K.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to show is the evidence to answer all those questions is available, and I can tell you every single bit of info about it. But it&#39;s just gonna seem alien to you. The reason I&#39;m picking this is because it takes intelligence but it takes WAY less intelligence than understanding geopolitics. That being said, it&#39;s still gonna take you 6 months of learning just to make sense of anything on that site. Now, geopolitics will take 10 years, so if you can master that site, then, I can tell you 1/20th of the info to understand geopolitics. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to show you is that even with evidence and questions, you will be unable to make enough sense of the &#39;evidence&#39; to answer the &#39;questions&#39;</p>

<p>And this is something A LOT of people can do. So, if you are unable to do something A LOT of people can do, how will you be able to understand something only A FEW people can do (like geopolitics).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. It&#39;s simple, everyone knows those in power like to keep their power. In the middle ages and before, families intermarried to preserve the powerful bloodlines--no one disputes this. Most people think these pharos/kings/queens just fell off the map when modern civilation came to be, but people don&#39;t just lose their power like that and die off. </p>

<p>What happened was they saw the people were beginning to outnumber them and they could no longer control them by force, so they decided to agree to get together and set up shadow goverments which they could control through finance.</p>

<p>In 1913, they took over america by causing a bank run through their influence in the media. They then offered a resolution to the panic they created by creating a central bank that was SEPARATE from any government (federal reserve). (You&#39;ll see a bunch of senators on youtube asking the leaders of the fed why gov&#39;t isn&#39;t allowed to audit them, and they just keep saying it needs to be independent for uh, reasons). So basically, through the control of the dollar, they can enact change with the push of a button.</p>

<p>Almost every nation&#39;s central bank is owned by the same guys (except iraq, which is one of the reasons we invaded).</p>

<p>So, TL:DR, kings/queens decided to control the world covertly through finance behind the scenes and never really lost their power.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my simple explanation. Much of it will seem absurd to the uninitiated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, so NOW you see the reality of the NSA situation since it&#39;s clear cut. But even when it was happening 10 years ago, in your mind, it didn&#39;t exist, right? Until someone tells you in a clear cut way the official 9/11 story is bogus, it won&#39;t exist for you either. So, one day when it doesn&#39;t matter anymore, you&#39;ll accept the truth.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all fine, but this is a place for people that see beyond the limitation of what&#39;s released to the public, so you and others like you that need a clear cut thing should stick to <a href="/r/actualconspiracies">/r/actualconspiracies</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>can you stop replying to me? you&#39;re obviously left over from the crosspost in <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> yesterday. i had to deal with 100s of you yesterday and i just wanna get back to the way things were. you wouldn&#39;t want the guys from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> spamming your sub would you? no! it sucks, and i just don&#39;t wanna do it after i did it for like 12 hours yesterday and got super downvoted all day.</p>

<p>plus, you&#39;re a dumb sports guy. how would you even comprehend that much reading? aren&#39;t you all based joining the group of people you were born around and yelling at the other groups? your consciousness is way to low and discipline way too lacking for an endeavor such as this.</p>

<p>just leave me alone and go back to yelling at groups outside your geographic area. that&#39;s what you sports guys do best. </p>

<p>OH! that&#39;s why you&#39;re doing this. i just realized! you&#39;re thinking of this in terms of teams! <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> vs. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></p>

<p>listen, you&#39;ll never like a team outside your geographic area, so how can you possibly comprehend something that&#39;s on such a higher level than just grunting and eating hot dogs and all that shit associated with dumb sports people talk?</p>

<p>you can continue, but i can&#39;t have an intelligent conversation with a sports guy. you just side with your team and dislike other teams, and that&#39;s the extent of your decision making skills.</p>

<p>NSA stuff is not conspiracy stuff. that&#39;s as mainstream as it gets.</p>

<p>anyway this sub has been infiltrated by you guys &#39;cause you guys can&#39;t stand us thinking this so much to the point you have to subscribe to it.</p>

<p>until snowden says something, you&#39;ll be too afraid to think it. let me tell you, 5 years ago, i stated the same thing and people like you said the same thing &quot;one agency sniffing all internet traffic is absurd!&quot; all you can really do is believe what the mainstream media says. so weak minded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Criminal-defense lawyer here with experience at both trial and appellate levels.  With due respect, this is a really, really simple court case.  Federal law requires you to pay taxes.  You willfully prepared false tax returns: based on the Code, you owed some amount of money, but said you owed nothing.  Federal tax returns aren&#39;t asking for your opinion, they&#39;re asking you to tell them what amount of money you owe them based on the tax code, which isn&#39;t a negotiable set of rules.  Because you thought it was okay to just say &quot;well, I don&#39;t think taxes should exist, and here&#39;s why&quot; has absolutely nothing to do with anything; it&#39;s just not relevant, because ignorance of the law isn&#39;t a defense.  (EDIT: Sometimes ignorance is a defense, like if it makes impossible the mental state required.  Here, though, it&#39;s not relevant.  See discussion below.)  The law is that you have to pay taxes.  You disagree with it.  Unfortunately, you don&#39;t decide the law, the Court does, and has--many, many times--and we have to pay taxes.  Sorry.  </p>

<p>In fact, the entire story you tell boils down to &quot;I did everything they accused me of, I admitted it in open court, and then I got convicted.&quot;  This argument is the equivalent of &quot;I think people should be able to possess heroin, so I had a pound of heroin in my car.  I went into court and argued that I should be able to have as much heroin as I want, but they just pointed to the statute and convicted me anyway, and I think that&#39;s really unfair.&quot;  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see any grounds for a motion to dismiss, and I don&#39;t see any grounds for appeal, at least not based on the information you&#39;ve laid out.  Without getting into the legal tests, there&#39;s nothing close to selective/vindictive prosecution here, even if every single thing you say is true.  Let me reiterate: you could be right about everything, up to and including the government&#39;s desire to suppress your statements, and you <em>still</em> would not have had a viable appellate claim.  </p>

<p>Frankly, the most promising legal issue in your situation would be suing Irwin Schiff for convincing you to behave in a way that he knew or should have known would result in you violating Federal law.  He led you astray, and that&#39;s a damn shame.  I&#39;m sorry you had to go through such a difficult time because of the selfishness, ignorance, and greed of a prominent public figure, and I hope you find some peace moving forward.  Best of luck.  </p>

<p>p.s. I&#39;d imagine this won&#39;t be received with open arms, and I understand if it&#39;s not something you want to hear--or something that others on this sub want to read--but really, this is an open-and-shut situation.  I&#39;m really sorry this happened to you, it sounds like you got taken in by a pretty convincing con man.  </p>

<p>TL;DR: Disagreement with the law isn&#39;t a defense to conviction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see how you&#39;d have trouble with that.  The problem is, that&#39;s not the language.  The language at issue is &quot;willfully filed,&quot; which, yes, in many circumstances means &quot;knew and believed to be false.&quot;  Unfortunately, the <em>reason</em> you didn&#39;t believe them to be false isn&#39;t one you&#39;re allowed to argue, as clearly explained by the Court of Appeals:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A willful violation is a voluntary, intentional relinquishment of a known legal duty. <em>Cheek v. United States</em>, 498 U.S. 192 (1991). An error arising from a bona fide misunderstanding of the Tax Code is not willful, but an error arising from a constitutional or philosophical objection is willful. <em>Cheek</em>, 498 U.S. at 205-206. The appellant argues that he sincerely believed that the Tax Code was unconstitutional. This is just the sort of argument that Cheek precludes. <em>United States v. 
Bonneau</em>, 970 F.2d 929 (1 Cir. 1992). In any event, he makes no st</p>

<p>If we&#39;re not in a court of law, you can make the argument you&#39;re making.  It&#39;s not a bad argument.  It&#39;s a good enough one that somebody argued it in front of the Supreme Court in <em>Cheek</em>, and somebody else kept trying in <em>Bonneau</em>.  Unfortunately, though, the Court ruled against your argument, and because there is direct, binding authority, the answer is clear: philosophical objections, no matter how honestly held, do not counter the requirement of willfullness.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see where you&#39;re coming from on this, but the problem is that <em>United States v. Bonneau</em>, 970 F.2d 929 (1st Cir. 1992) dealt with what seems to be an identical situation: based on his interpretations of the code, including some definitional issues like yours (he didn&#39;t believe that &quot;wages&quot; included &quot;income,&quot; for example, based on the wording), he decided not to pay taxes.  In <em>Bonneau</em>, when faced with precisely the situation of &quot;an incorrect interpretation of the law,&quot; the First Circuit--also binding authority, since you&#39;re up that way--stated: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>At trial Bonneau did not dispute that he owed taxes for both of the calendar years in question or that he took steps to prevent taxes from being withheld or paid, but he did deny that his actions were willful. Under Cheek v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 604, 610-11, 112 L.Ed.2d 617 (1991), the willfulness element of the crime charged can in some circumstances be defeated where a taxpayer wrongly but sincerely believed that no tax was due. Cheek holds, however, that while a misunderstanding of the tax laws may negate willfulness, the taxpayer&#39;s views about the validity of the tax statutes are not relevant to willfulness. Id. 111 S.Ct. at 613.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/ca1/41Es/united-states-v-paul-b-bonneau/">Bonneau para. 5</a></p>

<p>You didn&#39;t misunderstand them, it seems.  You believed that, because of how they were worded, they didn&#39;t actually exist.  If the beliefs you honestly held applied to everybody, nobody would have to pay taxes to the government.  That&#39;s functionally identical to &quot;doesn&#39;t believe that the tax statute is valid,&quot; which <em>Bonneau</em> dealt with.   </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s almost impossible to reasonably argue that your view was nothing more than an &quot;incorrect interpretation of the law&quot; based on the word &quot;liable,&quot; when 99.99999999999% of people are paying taxes irrespective of the precise word used.  There is, of necessity, a philosophical/moral aspect to your claim.  If there weren&#39;t, you&#39;d have just paid the taxes anyway, since you knew that&#39;s what the government expects you and everyone else to do, and what almost everyone else in the country is doing.  Trying to legitimate those philosophical objections through technicalities doesn&#39;t mean that you really, honestly thought that the government didn&#39;t expect you pay any taxes, which would approach the kind of misinterpretation <em>Cheek</em> allows.  Anyway, we&#39;re getting to the point where I&#39;m going to need to pull up WestLaw, and it&#39;s not really relevant anyway, since it&#39;s all over and done with.  All I can say is that I&#39;m sorry you had to go through that entire ordeal, and I wish you nothing but the best in the future.</p>

You sound like the stupid one when you thought the government was gonna let you prove that you didn&#39;t have to pay any taxes. Even if you were actually technically correct, guess what, that doesn&#39;t matter. Taxes are collected to support our modern society and it is not in society and the government&#39;s benefit to  allow you to not pay any. Just because you find some kind of legal loophole does not mean the government is going to look upon your actions favorably, and they clearly didn&#39;t in this case.</p>

<p>Your point stands that ignorance is sometimes a defense but clearly not in this situation.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t even referred to this situation, so I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re trying to argue it with me. My problem was with a false statement: ignorance is no defense. That was false. The original poster even corrected himself. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_v._California">Lambert v California</a> was a Supreme Court case that ruled ignorance of the law could be a valid defense.</p>

<p>In this case <em>willful</em> is the important word here, I haven&#39;t read any of the court documents, I don&#39;t know what to think about this case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely correct that ignorance can be a defense, even in criminal law at times.  I shouldn&#39;t have made that broad of a statement, as opposed to specifying that given the facts as OP described them, mistake/ignorance isn&#39;t relevant to his case.   </p>

<p>The Model Penal Code--which obviously isn&#39;t binding, but is a useful summary of the general principles--specifies that &quot;a belief that conduct does not legally constitute an offense is a defense to prosecution&quot; when:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(a) the statute or other enactment defining the offense is not known to the actor and has not been published or otherwise reasonably made available prior to the conduct alleged; or</p>

<p>(b) he acts in reasonable reliance upon an official statement of the law, afterward determined to be invalid or erroneous, contained in (i) a statute or other enactment; (ii) a judicial decision, opinion or judgment; (iii) an administrative order or grant of permission; or (iv) an official interpretation of the public officer or body charged by law with responsibility for the interpretation, administration or enforcement of the law defining the offense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, his erroneous belief doesn&#39;t constitute a defense.  If you can find me some authority to the contrary, that&#39;d be great, and I&#39;m sure OP would appreciate it as well.  Otherwise, though, I think we&#39;re back where we&#39;re started: although sometimes ignorance can be a defense, considering the facts of OP&#39;s case, it&#39;s not relevant here.  Thanks for pointing out the misstatement of law, though, because I agree that it&#39;s important to be accurate about these things.    </p>

<p>Well, it wasn&#39;t. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushaber_v._Union_Pacific_Railroad">That was settled by the SCOTUS in 1916.</a></p>

<p>But the basic premise of the argument is that in a number of states, the exact text of the amendment that was ratified by the state legislatures had small variations in capitalization or punctuation, differing from the exact text proposed by Congress (no distinctions of substance, though), and that those variations meant the ratification process was invalid. As is often the case, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_protester_Sixteenth_Amendment_arguments#Sixteenth_Amendment_ratification">Wikipedia</a> has further information.</p>

We argued that it would be unconstitutional if it were mandatory, but it wasn&#39;t mandatory. Schiff reasoned that the tax laws state that a person only has to pay taxes for which he is &quot;liable&quot;. </p>

<p>There are many federal taxes, and each one has a statute expressly using the word &quot;liable&quot;. Except for the income tax. It doesn&#39;t use the word &quot;liable&quot; so Schiff argued that it wasn&#39;t mandatory. </p>

<p>What Schiff didn&#39;t realize is that the courts are not that precise. If there is a statute which states something which means the same thing as being liable (which there is), then people are liable for that tax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I learned my lesson about challenging the federal income tax using Schiff&#39;s reasons. But I did come up with one of my own. I tried to promote it with a petition drive, but that was before I went to prison. I&#39;m just trying to get back on my feet, now.</p>

<p>My reason that the FIT is illegal is because, there is mucho testimiony in the Congressional Record when the 16th Amendment was being debated (and earlier) that it was only to be a tax on the wealthy (subsequent to the Industrial Revolution). And in the beginning, it was only a tax on the wealthy. However, over time, it morphed into a tax on virtually everyone. </p>

<p>My argument is, if it was only supposed to be on the wealthy, then it should remain only a tax on the wealthy.</p>

<p>First, was I correct in my assertion that Israelis and others loyal to Israel were complicit in the September 11th attacks in order to dupe the United States into bolstering its military presence in the Middle East against Israel&#39;s enemies?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Definitely. And people around the world know it. It&#39;s mostly only Americans that don&#39;t know this, because they&#39;re being kept in that false reality media bubble you discovered. (You were right about that, too.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Second, should a person be prosecuted, persecuted and silenced by his or her government for expressing his or her beliefs? And third, will I ever receive justice?&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hell, you can be executed for it. Ask <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/08/mystery-grows-in-journalists-death-prepping-obama-expose/">Michael Hastings</a>, the suicide bankers (one with a <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-02-07/4th-financial-services-executive-found-dead-self-inflicted-nail-gun-wounds">nail gun</a>!), reporters in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rXPrfnU3G0">Collateral Murder video</a>. There is no justice at the federal level. Only power.</p>

<p>The same could happen to any of us, but I think we have enough critical mass to speak freely now. Still, if you hear of a 43yo man from South Carolina committing suicide by nailgun... well... that was me.</p>

<p>If you are really uncomfortable paying federal taxes, you might consider <a href="http://www.expatinfodesk.com/expat-guide/relinquishing-citizenship/renunciating-your-us-passport/five-steps-to-renunciating-your-us-passport/">renouncing citizenship</a>. But I wonder if the US govt is angling for <a href="http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2014/06/03/nyt-bergdahl-left-a-desertion-note-n1847046">renouncing citizenship</a> to be seen as a sign of terrorist intent. (I suspect Burgdahl will be used in a domestic terrorism false flag operation.)</p>

<p>That would put us in a pickle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>finally! someone admits there&#39;s the type of person that does this! you go into other people&#39;s subs and lurk while thinking up ways in how they&#39;re stupid/deluded and what not.</p>

<p>i was wondering what the motivation was. you need to convince others of something to feel more comfortable in yourself. makes so much sense now. exactly what homophobes do to gay people.</p>

<p>the question, is why do what others do affect you? the same reason those christians can&#39;t stand gay marriage -- they must control other&#39;s thoughts to suppress insecurities in themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not exactly. I grew up enjoying reading about conspiracy theories, but as I&#39;ve gotten older, I can read between the lines. A fair amount of the theories are just rooted in political ideology and bigoted hatred. </p>

<p>I only argue with ones that I have ironclad scientific knowledge to refute, it&#39;s very different from someone berating and shaming someone out of some moral ideology derived from a religious text. I don&#39;t disparage the person, I present logical counterarguments based in science when I feel qualified enough to do so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah well what scientific proof was there of the NSA intercepting all internet data 10 years ago? None! You&#39;d have called those people a crackpot. You&#39;d be limited by information available to the public. But you know what? It was rampant regardless of public knowledge. Only me and others like us knew it to be fact at the time. History&#39;s repeating itself now. And I&#39;m getting the same shit from you as i got 10 years ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, you didn&#39;t know it to be fact. I think most people, myself included, knew that something was going on, but without proof, one cannot say definitely what is true without being disingenuous. Look into my comment history for r/conspiracy, I don&#39;t berate people or insult their intelligence. I pick very specific arguments that I have an educational background in, and provide a counterargument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i ask this again. THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?</p>

<p>NSA stuff is not conspiracy stuff. that&#39;s as mainstream as it gets.</p>

<p>anyway this sub has been infiltrated by you guys &#39;cause you guys can&#39;t stand us thinking this so much to the point you have to subscribe to it.</p>

<p>until snowden says something, you&#39;ll be too afraid to think it. let me tell you, 5 years ago, i stated the same thing and people like you said the same thing &quot;one agency sniffing all internet traffic is absurd!&quot; all you can really do is believe what the mainstream media says. so weak minded.</p>
