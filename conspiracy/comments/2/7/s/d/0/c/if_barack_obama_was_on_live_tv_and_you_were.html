    <div class="md"><p>I would start my piece by reminding him of what he said about bush and hiw bush increased our national debt, and how obama said (while still a senator running for president) that continually raising the debt limit is a mark of poor leadership. Then i would continue by reminding him that in the six years he has been president, our national debt has increased more than in bush&#39;s eight years, and i would remind him of his administrations repeated lifting of the debt ceiling.</p>

<p>Then i would ask him my question:</p>

<p>&quot;What does this say about YOUR leadership. I know what senator obama would say to that question, but what about president obama?&quot;</p>

<p>Then i would ask him if hes really gay or not.</p>
