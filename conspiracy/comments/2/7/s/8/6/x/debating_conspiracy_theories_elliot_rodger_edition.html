However I sometimes stumble upon new <em>CTs</em> and have an urge to debate them, since I know how CT people think (as I used to be one of them) and try to see if they make any sense.</p>

<p>Anyways. Now that the whole Isla Vista shooting happened I heard about these people on youtube who basically say it was a hoax, the shooting didn&#39;t happened and they want to take the guns away.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t buy this, but I don&#39;t know where I can discuss this. Basically the youtubers remove all comments that challenge this theory and there is no one taking it seriously who debates it. So there is no good public forum.</p>

<p>Anyone got any idea if there is a forum dedicated to this?</p>

<p>I fully believe that people lie. However I take the innocent until proven guilty stance, and also the &quot;extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence&quot;.</p>

<p>I rather admit that &quot;I don&#39;t know what happened&quot; than to rationalize something based on my ignorance or incredulity.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just simply something I have learned in logic, critical thinking and open mindedness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Innocent until proven guilty&quot; is a legal standard, not a logical one.  The logical thing to do is to look at an event and its outcomes and weigh competing explanations to see which might be more probable.</p>

<p>For example: the Kennedy assassination.  Given all of the circumstances, which is more probable: that Kennedy was killed by a single, mentally impaired man with nothing to gain, who just happened to have a job at a building in a city where the President would be driving by in an open car, or that he was killed by a group of people with a lot to gain and a lot to protect who could have orchestrated it?</p>

<p>As for 9/11: Doesn&#39;t &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; apply to Al Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden?  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes and I usually think that the conspiracy is less probable. Especially in this case. I think a guy going crazy and shooting a bunch of people is more likely than &quot;the government&quot; (or whoever is blamed for this) staging 7 deaths, many injuries, buying actors to fake parents of dead children and much more, to take away guns. I think this is a little excessive.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a loaded question.</p>

<p>I think it is more probably that a crazy man shoots someone than a conspiracy. Also it doesn&#39;t always matter what is more probable but what has evidence and what is falsifiable.</p>

<p>But this is not about Kennedy, so please don&#39;t derail this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As for 9/11: Doesn&#39;t &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; apply to Al Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, and there is evidence showing they are behind this. Of course I know I heard the arguments that that is faked evidence, But then again this is shifting the goal post and conformation bias, aka unfalsifiability.</p>

<p>My question always would be &quot;how do you disprove your theory&quot; if you cannot give me that answer then the theory isn&#39;t scientific and can never be answered in a meaningful way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think what you are looking for is some whack job foaming at the mouth trying to connect everything to everything that you can make fun of.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No I want to hear explanations that go beyond &quot;this kinda looks suspicious, must be the government taking away out guns&quot;. And of course no censorship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If anything that I have learned from being a conspiracy theorist then it is the fact that I used a lot of logical fallacies.</p>

<p>Mostly argument from ignorance and argument from incredulity.</p>

<p>Also appeal to authority and false equivocation.</p>

<p>Learning about fallacies made me realize that a lot of believes I had were unfounded so I dismissed them.</p>

<p>However I would be totally on board of 911 truth if the evidence again is overwhelming. or any other idea about false flag etc.</p>

<p>Right now however I am not convinced and my standard of evidence has not been met.</p>

<p>I was on the fence for a long time however, now I am more in the &quot;well I don&#39;t know but I think it is foolish to hold a believe that I cannot support anymore&quot; position. Hope that sounds reasonable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds very reasonable to me. On the topic of 9/11 i would say im on the fence. At the very least, i feel there was criminal negligence on our leaderships part. Whether it was done on purpose or not, i cant say, and i dont care. What bothers me is the clear and obvious fact that there was criminal negligence, and no one is being punished for it. Now one is even investigsting it (on an offical/federal level). This leads me to believe something doesnt add up. </p>

<p>Hell, one of my jobs i work as a custodian at a local train station. If there is a bunch of trash flying around, i am the one responsibke for it, and i get in trouble, regardless of whether or not i knew that trash was there because it was my responsibility.</p>

<p>But, when it comes to 9/11 and our defense system, it is their responsibility to make sure things like 9/11 dont happen. Especially if they knew about it beforehand (which considerable evidence does support that claim.). Even if they didnt know beforehand, their reaction was poor at best. They didnt follow proper FAA protocol when the first planes lost contact to flight control and deviated from course. They didnt follow protocol in alarming the right officials and superiors right away at the first hint something was wrong. There is so much they did wrong, yet NO ONE was punished or held responsible. That fact, in and of itself, is why i suspicious of the whole event. </p>

<p>Then there are more problems like the fact that jet fuel burns at a max of 1900 degrees fahrenheit, while steel begins to melt at around 2500 degrees fahrenheit. Ive hear that you dont need to reach melting temperature for a steel building to collapse, you just need it hit eniugh to soften the steel and undermine its structural integrity. But the issue is, if it only burned hot enough to soften it, it wouldnt completely cave in on itself, rather, it would topple over as it would inevitably be heated unevenly in parts. </p>

<p>(Ill make a connection to what you said about using fallacies. One of the fallacies you said you used to partake in is argument from ignorance/incredulity. I will admit, i do that as well, but i will typically and willfully admit that thst is what i am doing. I am only speculating based on my current state of knowledge on these physical concepts and whatnot, so take it for what its worth.)</p>

<p>As i said, i dont know everything there is to know about all this 9/11 shit. All i do know is that some things dont add up, and they are not being addressed by the officals in charge. That creates an air of suspicion. </p>

<p>I agree, however 911 was 13 years ago and is not as important anymore than it was maybe 6 or 7 years ago.</p>

<p>We should learn from it if something like it happens again and make sure people will be held accountable for a tragedy like this. Whether or not it was false flag or outside. In either case it is the government job to protect its citizens and if they fuck up they should be held accountable for it. Same for any job.</p>

<p>And 13 years ago.. holy moly there are 13 year old kids today who did not experience 911, kinda weird to think about it, it is so normal to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then there are more problems like the fact that jet fuel burns at a max of 1900 degrees fahrenheit, while steel begins to melt at around 2500 degrees fahrenheit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah that is one of the arguments I heard a lot and I was subscribed to it. However I also heard the alternative. The steel doesn&#39;t need to melt but being wobbly is enough for the building to collapse.</p>

<p>And there isn&#39;t just jet fuel that burned, but also the stuff inside the building, don&#39;t forget.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ive hear that you dont need to reach melting temperature for a steel building to collapse, you just need it hit eniugh to soften the steel and undermine its structural integrity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes that is also one of the explanations. I mean there as a plan hitting the building. People sometimes neglect it (or outright deny it, i know some of the 911 truthers think it was a hologram. Not even I could believe that).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it would topple over as it would inevitably be heated unevenly in parts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually it kinda did. There are multiple angels of the crumbling and there is at least one which shows that it is not perfectly falling into itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am only speculating based on my current state of knowledge on these physical concepts and whatnot, so take it for what its worth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is absolutely okay. It is not wrong to ask questions. It is wrong however to conclude an answer without evidence.</p>

<p>Even if all that sounds very unlikely you cannot say &quot;therefor the government/aliens/illuminati did it&quot;. You can say &quot;well this sounds unreasonable, I don&#39;t believe it, however I don&#39;t know have an explanation to why this happened.</p>

<p>And of course there are explanations. But usually CT people dismiss them as part of the conspiracy <em>(which is why I think it is an unfalsifiable  position, because any counter arguments are part of the conspiracy, so the conspiracy theory cannot be proven wrong).</em></p>

<p>I recommend you a series on youtube by Miles Power.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPiBuIu_svYgsdIIuB2xouL5T3ZUW58vj">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPiBuIu_svYgsdIIuB2xouL5T3ZUW58vj</a></p>

<p>he goes over a lot of the claims. Take what you want from it. I thought it was pretty good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to be a conspiracy theorist.  Then I met someone who told me the goal of all these conspiracies was to increase surveillance, instill more fear, militarize the police, and garner greater control over the populace.  </p>

<p>I was incredulous and thought he was crazy and after that lost my zeal for conspiracy theories.  </p>

<p>Faster forward and here we are.  Greater surveillance, fear on multiple levels of the government, militarized police, and a greater control over the population are reality and no longer conspiracy.  he was right.  </p>

<p>One other thing he said.  The crazier the conspiracy is, the less likely people are to believe it.  I never realized how true it was until this past couple years.  He is long gone now.  But his truth remains with me to this day.  I have no attachment to the esoteric and spiritual conspiracy things.  I neither serve nor believe in any god so things like that may come into play but are not part of reality IMO. </p>

<p>Just be sure you don&#39;t discard reality because it sounds too crazy.  Anything sufficiently crazy enough in reality is easier to hide from general populace. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe you just created a thread in just the forum you were looking for, sir.</p>

<p>But first, may i ask why you say that you &quot;used&quot; to be a conspiracy theorist? What drove you away? What convinced you to be otherwise? I hope im not stepping on your toes when i say that it is possible to discuss these theories while compartmentalizing your beliefs. For instance, i keep an open mind and am able to discuss various theories, all the while i know i dont believe them. (I believe some, but definstely not all).</p>

<p>So, pardon the segway, but on to your subject matter.</p>

<p>I wont pretend to know whether or not these shootings were hoaxes or false flags. They could be. But it is also possibke that there are some bad people in this world who do bad things for unknown reasons. </p>

<p>As for the recent shootings, same thing. However, i dont think it is the most efficient use of our investigatory skills to figure out whether or not it was a hoax. Instead, i think it would behoove us more if we focused on why the hell the politicians jump immediately to trite anthems of gun prohibitions in light of these tragedies (fake or real, doesnt matter).</p>

<p>They claim to have answers to fix these situations even before they know just what exactly went on in the first place.</p>

<p>That means one of two things, either:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They planned for it to happen, eliminating the need for conclusive results from the investigations, or</p></li>
<li><p>They dont know what the fuck happened, and they dont care. They just want to get rid of access to firearms for the populace.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In both cases, they just want to prohibit guns for the common person. To what end? Now thats another discussion altogether.</p>

<p>But first, may i ask why you say that you &quot;used&quot; to be a conspiracy theorist?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believed in all sorts of claims. Starting from very fringe ideas about aliens, going to the more sane political scam ideas such as 911 inside job, a lot of what Alex Jones talked about etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What drove you away?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I first was driven away by the spiritual, esoteric stuff about aliens, reincarnation, etc. by members of 911 truth etc. They basically said they were all crazy, and I cannot really tell you what happened back then, but I couldn&#39;t believe in magic anymore.</p>

<p>911 was a bit harder to get away from. I guess it was 2011 or 2010. I had a friend who was at a bilderberg meeting in greece. He told me all about it and got some price from a blog hoster who was &quot;exposing the truth&quot;.</p>

<p>I talked a lot with him about conspiracies. 911 was my favorite as I believed very strongly it was an inside job. But during that time I was also debating creationists, I learned a lot of critical thinking skills I simply lacked <em>(basically my brain was tolerant to any none mainstream idea to the point I believed almost anything, while ignoring things which had better evidence to support simply because they were mainstream)</em>.</p>

<p>Thanks to these critical thinking skills I was able to ask questions about 911 theories as well and came to the conclusion that neither side was able to convince me anymore. In the last 3-4 years I learned more and also exposed myself to the debunking videos of it and they convinced me more than the 911 truth stuff.</p>

<p>However the main reason I wasn&#39;t a truther anymore was unfalsifiability. Basically most conspiracy theories are not falsifiable, because CT people will always shift the goal more and more and basically excuse any hole in their explanation with &quot;this is also part of the conspiracy&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i think it would behoove us more if we focused on why the hell the politicians jump immediately to trite anthems of gun prohibitions in light of these tragedies (fake or real, doesnt matter).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah I know, but same old same old. That people will talk about gun control is pretty normal after a shooting.</p>

<p>I am not american, we don&#39;t have easy access to guns here <em>(Germany, hopefully you don&#39;t dismiss me because of that)</em> so to me it is kinda hard to understand the sentiment of americans when it comes to guns. For outsiders it always looks like americans are all crazy because of it <em>(and I personally think people who think the government fakes a shooting to take away guns are pretty crazy but yeah that is up for debate)</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In both cases, they just want to prohibit guns for the common person. To what end? Now thats another discussion altogether.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think many people over dramatize this whole gun issue to be honest. I have not really heard any legislation that bans all guns, usually they just want to restrict the access to them. Make checks for people with mental health issues or criminal records etc.</p>

<p>I personally am in favor of that, while I also agree that if a person wants to shoot a bunch, that person will have access to guns no matter what. But making it hard could potentially prevent some problems, but that&#39;s just my 2 cents.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s something you don&#39;t like then don&#39;t do it. I don&#39;t get how what others are doing matters.</p>

<p>Anyways, I did appreciate your honesty and taking the times to post this. I have often felt myself having similar feelings that you expressed above. I just try not to make up my mind or insist on anything. I&#39;ll keep reading both the mainstream and the conspiracy theories and my mind will probably be somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>And to answer your question about this event. The speculation I&#39;ve seen that it&#39;s a false flag mostly come from eye witness accounts of there being a second person in the car. This is a tough one because eye witness accounts are notoriously bad and who knows if they are even telling the truth?</p>

<p>The other thing mentioned is the lack of blood in his car (where he shot himnself in the head) and in the pictures of the storefront. The storefront makes sense (there would only be blood splatter if there were exit wounds) but I&#39;m not sure how there would be no blood at all in the seat where he killed himself.
Either way, the theory that this is a false flag is fairly weak at the moment. More data is needed.</p>

<p>Well maybe you misunderstood a bit.</p>

<p>What I mean is that people who give alternative explanations to events such as 911, usually always will shift the goal of their idea.</p>

<p>Like you ask &quot;what happened to the passangers of the plane&quot; and then multiple answers come such as &quot;they never existed&quot; or &quot;they were all killed somewhere else&quot; etc. But usually when you keep asking it boils down to it being also a part of the conspiracy without giving any evidence for that claim.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t do that (hopefully) and if I do that people should call me out on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I get what you meant, I just think it&#39;s bad to try and frame the entire conspiracy theory community this way. You didn&#39;t do it, I don&#39;t do it.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s just that especially in the case of Elliot Rodger it kinda pisses me off.</p>

<p>I mean they claim one of the vicitms father is an actor.</p>

<p>Granted if he is, then they are right and I have nothing to complain about.</p>

<p>However if they are wrong, they basically make fun of a guy who lost his son. That&#39;s not funny. That is fucking sad, and it kinda pisses me off, this is also why I wanted to debate this, because if they are right then this is outrages, but if they are wrong they are horrible people.</p>

<p>Also I think this is not a real community. I bet everyone here has some believes the other doesn&#39;t and people will agree and disagree on a lot of things. I bet some people here think the Moon Landing was fake, and some people think people who believe that are idiots.</p>

<p>So I cannot even frame everyone in a bad light here because everyone has probably some idea that someone else finds fringe.</p>

<p>You are trying to paint yourself as a critical thinker, but you are just a reed blowing in the wind, vacillating this way and that depending on how &quot;persuasive&quot; you find a certain rhetoric. Try to make your own decision based on a knowledge of events and the balance of probabilities. Your starting point on 9/11 is the official government/media narrative which is completely riddled with improbabilities. </p>

<p>Yes and so is any alternative story I&#39;ve heard besides the one of &quot;let it happen&quot;. Which is imo the more reasonable explanation compared to any other conspiracy theory about 911.</p>

<p>but seriously. This is not about 911 but about Elliot Rodger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im actually a german citizen. So prost! Haha. (I have dual citizenship with the USA and germany).</p>

<p>But anyways, i used to be for bigger background checks. But the fact is i have lost trust in my own government. I know the history of the nazis, and how they had everyone register thier guns just so they know where they are when they were ready to confiscate them.</p>

<p>With the whole NSA bullshit, i distrust my government with the knowledge of whether or not i own a firearm, if only to try and prevent another holocaust (history doesnt always repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme).</p>

<p>My biggest issue with this whole gun control mess is that they are focusing on assault weapons. They say their intentions are to curb gun crimes and deaths caused by guns. </p>

<p>But, when you consider that two thirds of ALL gun deaths are suicides (in america, at least), and then consider the fact the vast majority of all gun crimes are committed with pistolS and handguns, why then, is it &quot;common sense&quot; (as they say) to ban assault rifles? </p>

<p>Thats like saying that by banning cars we can stop drunk driving deaths, instead of enforcing the rules already in legislation the way its supposed to be in the first place.</p>

<p>It just doesnt make sense to me, thats all. </p>

<p>If they want to curb gun violence, it would only be logical to then attack the means of said gun violence, which, as i already pointed out, is greatly perpetrated using pistols and handguns.</p>

<p>All of this, without even discussing the psychological issues of psychiatric prescriptions in connection with various massacres, which, unsurprisingly, has repeatedly been snuffed out by the gun grabbers. </p>

<p>I enjoy your sentiment fairly, regarding an outsiders view on us &quot;crazy&quot; americans. I can only say that it is the result of our history and what our founding fathers have implemented into our government. Our government, or rather what it was intended to be&#39; is different from germanys, or any in europe, or any in the world for that matter.</p>

<p>Our founding fathers knew the dangers of centralized power. They knew the dangers of tyranny, and understood it so well that they placed safeguards in place to protect our people. The second amendment is a sort of last line of defense against tyranny. It is also why the posse comitatus act was passed. </p>

<p>Our federal government has limited powers. It is only allowed to do certain things that our constituion explicitly says it can do. Nothing more. Everything else goes to the state and local governments. However, when the federal government starts to usurp powers and authorities not granted to it by our constitution, we get a step closer to tyranny.</p>

<p>All signs and patterns indicate the possibilty for tyranny in america to be increasing. This is why americans are so adament on protecting our firearms. When, or if, shit hits the fan, and our federal government controls EVERYTHING, the only thing we have left to rely on is our friends overseas (which we are increasingly pissing off more and more each day, unfortunately) and ourselves. </p>

<p>Personally, i feel there are far greater concerns to our health and wellbeing than to fight this whole gun ownership shit. For instance, the war on drugs creates criminals out of peaceful drug users. Sure, crime exists because of drugs, but it is in my opinion that the majority of the crimes are because these drugs are illegal (ill reference the times of alcohol prohibition in america as a template for this point). Yet, we waste billions every year fighting a losing battle. Something else needs to be done.</p>

<p>Same thing with gun crimes. Banning guns will not make it harder for criminals to get guns. Period. They will find a way. They always do. It will only make it harder for law abiding citizens to gain access to firearms. (Which isnt a bad thing. In america, more crimes are stopped every year by guns than are perpetrated by guns.) </p>

<p>But my point stands. If curbing gun crime is the goal, why not focus on the types of guns that comprise the vast majority of gun crimes--pistols and handguns--rather than rifles? </p>

<p>What they are doing or trying to do wont work. They need to figure out another solution, but they are either too stupid, too ignorant, or too proud to even try any other solutions. Either that, or curbing gun violence isnt their main goal.</p>

<p>I agree to an extend.</p>

<p>I mean it makes sense that handguns are most used as they are cheap(er) and easier to carry around. But I still think that americans take the whole &quot;muh guns&quot; thing a bit too serious. Because they Only think one sided. They only think about guns being used to defend themselves, however this is normal to think if you are a normal citizen. </p>

<p>Also of course there is the whole dilemma of shooting someone even in self defense. You will live your entire life with the thought of having killed someone.</p>

<p>But all in all I am not too big into the gun debate as I am not american and it doesn&#39;t really concern me.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes but a common argument I heard was that guns back then were just not the same as they are now. And I do believe if the government wants to take over the country they will just slaughter everyone with their super amazing high tech military stuff.</p>

<p>Or they will fail because the people they hire are most likely citizens and won&#39;t kill the entire population, especially not the population of their own home towns and cities.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m all for legalization as I think the drug war is the most pointless thing america has ever done.</p>

<p>I think if you want to reduce crime you need to have a more social system which takes care of those who feel betrayed by society and use violence to get what they need. But that goes into a whole new debate.</p>

<p>Yes there is a valid point here. However, in my opinion, i dont think it matters what guns were available then, and which ones are available now. Its the principle that matters to me. As for our government (keeping the hypothetical) wanting to take over our country, it would be a tremendous endeavor if all 300+ million citizens were armed even with remedial firearms versus their less than three million (1.5 mil active, 1.2 reserves). Of course, the military has tanks and bombs and shit, but the shear number of armed citizens shoukd be enough to persuade them to abandon an allout massacre of hundreds of millions of people using armaments meant for war. Not only would that destroy the entire infrastructure of our country, it would destroy what they wish to control. Defeats the purpose. Their solution? Confiscate guns, then go in force. (Remember, we are staying in the hypothetical here...) </p>

<p>The point is, 300 million armed people who know their land better than anyone else is a formidable defense, regardless of training or lack thereof. That is why it is important for us to remain beholden to our rights.</p>
