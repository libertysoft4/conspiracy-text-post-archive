<p>How do you know it&#39;s not legitimate science?  Are you a scientist?  In any case if you reread my comment you can plainly see I wrote, &quot;<em>Some think</em> there&#39;s an increase of positive ions during a full moon.&quot;</p>

<p>You can search for that answer yourself.  I don&#39;t claim to be a scientist, but I&#39;ve read several sources that state the possibility of negative and positive ions affecting human behavior.  To assume the human body and brain aren&#39;t influenced by electrical charges is foolish.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The laws of nature and science are what create ions.  As wonderful and powerful as I am, I haven&#39;t gotten around to learning how to do that yet.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He may actually have a point there:</p>

<p>Ionization of the air : An abundance of negative condensation nuclei (“air ions”) in ingested air enhances alertness and exhilaration, while an excess of positive ions enhances drowsiness and depression. Calculation of the ionic balance of a target audience’s atmospheric environment will be correspondingly useful. Again this is a naturally-occurring condition - caused by such varying agents as solar ultraviolet light, lightning, and rapidly-moving water - rather than one which most be artificially created. (Detonation of nuclear weapons, however, will alter atmospheric ionization levels.) Cf. Soyke, Fred and Edmonds, Alan, The Ion Effect . New York: E.P. Dutton, 1977.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure of the exact mechanism of action, perhaps <a href="/r/askscience">/r/askscience</a> can provide an answer. From <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/552/do-things-get-crazy-when-the-moon-is-full">a related article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A new twist was recently given to lunar-effect theorizing by the discovery that positive and negative ions in the atmosphere have an effect on behavior (negative ions usually favorable, positives the opposite). It turns out that positive ions are more abundant when the moon is full. However, the effect is slight compared to major sources of positive ions like air conditioning and air pollution.</p>

<p>Of course. They would approach the very notion with the same smug, dismissive, willfully ignorant rhetoric as you have, as they would anything else that isn&#39;t already common knowledge, or happens to be posted on Wikipedia, or that doesn&#39;t fit their tunnel-vision narrative.</p>

<p>All the research I&#39;ve seen and referred to so far points to negatively charged ions having a positive affect on human mood, with positively charged ions having the opposite. </p>

<p>Would that somehow make cyanide safe for human consumption? Of course not. While we&#39;re it, have any more logical fallacies you want to throw out there just for the hell of it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That article doesn&#39;t give a single source for his (outlandish) claims about ions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s ironic about attacking that particular source, is that it is a website advocating a skeptical position to such topics, and was cited in a Wikipedia entry regarding the pseudoscience of claims regarding the moon influencing human behavior. In regards to the full moons, while there is a <em>weak correlation</em> to suggest it <em>may</em> be possible, with positively charged ions being slightly more abundant during a full moon, and with positively charged ions having adverse affects on human mood and biochemistry in sufficient quantities, the quantity that is present during a full moon is substantially less than that required to produce such an effect. Any subjective affect would likely be the result of the human psyche, or a placebo affect, or perhaps a hypersensitivity to positively charged ions, though that would be a point of pure speculation. A common thunder storm would be more likely to produce an observable effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. Placebo is pretty powerful. Equally powerful is the concept of suggestion.</p>

<p>Though this proves nothing elsewhere in the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, im not claiming any scientific basis for my previous comment. Its just anecdotal, at best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. The moon&#39;s gravitational affect on Earth is constant, of course - its mass and distance from earth is doesn&#39;t change, irrespective of how illuminated it appears from Earth.</p>

<p>But, when the moon is full, as viewed from Earth, it is because it is directly opposite the sun. It is the alignment of sun, earth and moon (an astronomical phenomeon known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygy_%28astronomy%29">syzygy</a>) which creates the extra gravitational pull. This is why tides at full moon (and new moon) are stronger than at other times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, honestly, its just a pair-up of two uncommon instances (so to speak, a full moon is kind of uncommon if you think about the lunar cycle--full moons account for only 1/29th-ish of the time, and friday the 13th is an even more uncommon date. Put the two together and you get a much more rare occurance.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Literally nothing you just said is actually legitimate science.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some think there&#39;s an increase of positive ions during a full moon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How exactly would that work? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>when they have a positive charge they can have a bad effect people&#39;s moods and health</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This makes no sense, and nothing in modern science would agree with it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Negative ions make you feel good</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same with this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you can increase them by taking a shower or being in a natural setting near a waterfall out in the wilderness or going to the beach.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you can create ions out of thin air just by looking at a waterfall?</p>
