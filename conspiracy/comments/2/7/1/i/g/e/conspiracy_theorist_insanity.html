    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;Conspiracy theorist&quot; has now become an insult to free thinkers. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I tell you it actually started as a secret phrase by some to describe what you call &#39;free thinkers&#39; in the 1980s then it got stolen by the very-same people you&#39;re encouraging from the hands of power to be used colliqually by those who were disenfranchised by it only for it to spiral out of control back to its original use as a derogatory term what do you have to say about it?</p>

<p>What if &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; was a polite and proper term to say &#39;self-deluded dissident&#39; by people with power to those they cared about, to avoid the harsher words of what they really thought of them? Then a &quot;free-thinker&quot; got it into their minds (cause culture is a complex and beautiful mistress, no?) that they should share this term with the people who were getting the short end of the stick as it were. So now we have conspiracy theorists given a new unity, a name they took from others, a sort of promethean imagery, but they still face the problems they did before, they&#39;re self-deluded dissidence to formal established authority. </p>

<p>With one another, agreeing that authority is disagreeable to them (because they insist on being themselves) they can have a mediocre time, even like one another. But if you get them to discuss any real topic they find that they dislike opinions not their own, put a pair of conspiracy theorists in a closet and they&#39;re going to discard the arguement about why they&#39;re in the closet in favour of discussing who is more oppressed by the pink dress that never hurt anyone. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Keep this in mind whenever you throw out a theory or idea.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, but it&#39;s discouraging and frustrating, why do all these people continue to hang out with those who are identified by others as conspiracy theorists? What sort of gratification do they expect from talking about their discontent with the government amongst people who don&#39;t seem to be able to do much about it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whenever there is an overzealous group trying to ridicule you for rational and critical thinking, you may be on the right track.</p>

<p>Fingerpainting with a wide stroke are we? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are aware of the mass downvotes and disingenuous posters on this sub so let&#39;s try to utilize it to the best of our advantage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not to your advantage, the delusion is clear, you will try to think of a way to use the efforts of your enemy to your advantage but it is not possible because they&#39;re focused on disrupting you, exactly that, you will not be able to organize effectively when your only hopes are the combined efforts of the malcontents who insist that every attempt to make them see reason is a conspiracy against them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are well aware that media has a profound effect on the minds of the people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No you&#39;re not. More like &#39;<code>we are of limited awareness on the issue that the media may affect more people, profoundly affecting the life we share</code>&#39;. What makes you more aware than say a market analyst who watches trends arising in the youth, or a university professor teaching art history? </p>
