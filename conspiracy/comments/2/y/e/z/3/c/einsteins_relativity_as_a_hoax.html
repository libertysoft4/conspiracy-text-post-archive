        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In Einstein&#39;s relativity, motion is relative to frames of reference. If you for example stand on Earth and watch a spaceship fly by in space, then Earth is your frame of reference, and the spaceship is the frame of reference for the pilot in the ship.</p>

<p>What, then, is the velocity, according to Einstein&#39;s relativity between say two photons approaching each other from opposite directions along the same line? It&#39;s always possible to postulate that the maximum relative velocity is c, the speed of light. But what does the math in Einstein&#39;s relativity say? The answer is that the velocity between the photons cannot be calculated with Einstein&#39;s relativity.</p>

<p>The cop out physicists use is to claim that photons have no frame of reference. How convenient. Another incredible claim in Einstein&#39;s relativity is that one event A can happen in a different order (before or after) another event B, depending on the observers&#39; reference frames.</p>

<p>Does Einstein&#39;s relativity really describe how physics works? One conspiracy theory is that Einstein&#39;s relativity is a deliberate hoax. </p>

<p>Knowledge is power, and if you can keep the real knowledge within the classified world and give the public scientific community false theories as diversions your power will more easily remain even with future progress.</p>

<p>How would that have been possible? How can the whole public scientific community be fooled so monumentally? One example is GPS. The claim is that Einstein&#39;s relativity is compensated for by adjusting the clocks in the GPS satellites before launch. Very few people have access to the clocks in the satellites and it&#39;s easy to claim that an adjustment has been made when in reality it hasn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Scientists in the classified world may disagree with you. The power gained from diverting the public scientific community is considerable.</p>

<p>Here is a smaller example of manipulation of the public scientific community:</p>

<p>&quot;According to John Kelsey (who was listed as author of NIST SP 800-90A together with Elaine Barker), the possibility of the backdoor by carefully chosen P and Q values was brought up at an ANSI X9.82 meeting. As a result, a way was specified for implementers to choose their own P and Q values.[14] It turned out later that the specific subtle formulation that NIST put into the standard meant that you could only get the crucial FIPS 140-2 validation of your implementation if you used the original compromised P and Q values.[15]&quot; -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG#Timeline">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG#Timeline</a></p>

<p>So only a few gatekeeper scientists are needed to manipulate the GPS satellites. Most scientists in public academia would believe the GPS satellites have been adjusted and therefore be monumentally fooled.</p>

<p>I believe photons are wave packets. A wave packet may appear as a particle but is in reality a result of nonlocal waves added together. So there are only waves. As Stephen Hawking wrote:</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe that is our mistake: maybe there are no particle positions and velocities, but only waves. It is just that we try to fit the waves to our preconceived ideas of positions and velocities.The resulting mismatch is the cause of the apparent unpredictability.&quot; -- <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking</a></p>

<p>Dark matter doesn&#39;t exist. They can&#39;t prove it exists and the mystery is solved by having earth at the center of the universe and stationary. It&#39;s a consequence of relativity only, and realativity is a farce developed to avoid admitting the earth is stationary. It was born out of necessity to make the earth move when Michelson-Morley&#39;s experiments showed it didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Without relativity, the universe is undeniably geocentric with a stationary earth.</p>

<p>Without dark matter, galaxies would be unable to keep their shapes. Some have suggested modifying the law of gravity, such as MOND. To me that&#39;s just a messy ad hoc attempt to match observed data by modifying the equations. And:</p>

<p>&quot;The most serious problem facing Milgrom&#39;s law is that it cannot completely eliminate the need for dark matter in all astrophysical systems: galaxy clusters show a residual mass discrepancy even when analysed using MOND.[2]&quot; -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Newtonian_dynamics#Outstanding_problems_for_MOND">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Newtonian_dynamics#Outstanding_problems_for_MOND</a></p>

<p>How does earth&#39;s ecliptic plane align with the plane of the Milky Way? I found this:</p>

<p>&quot;... the plane of the ecliptic is tilted roughly towards the direction of the solar system&#39;s orbital motion around the galaxy.&quot; -- <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/the-ecliptic-and-the-galactic-planes.689810/">https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/the-ecliptic-and-the-galactic-planes.689810/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice illustrations. I have difficulty grasping the alignment though.</p>

<p>With the warm dark matter hypothesis, dark matter closer to earth will contribute more radiation effect. So a dark matter halo around earth could produce the CMB dipole. Alternatively it&#39;s dark matter from the whole Milky Way galaxy that produces the lopsided CMB, but that requires that earth&#39;s ecliptic plane is aligned with the Milky Way in such way, and that may not be the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As your attorney, I advise you to wander on over to <a href="/r/geocentrism">/r/geocentrism</a> and study the material there. I advise you to visit <a href="http://galileowaswrong.com">Galileo Was Wrong</a> and watch <a href="http://theprinciplemovie.com">this film about the CMB radiation</a> when it reaches a theater near you.</p>

<p>You&#39;re already about three-quarters of the way to geocentrism, so as your attorney it is imperative that you understand that geocentrism is the conclusion you&#39;re headed towards on this path of yours. The geocentric solution solves the problem of dark matter, dark energy, relativity contradictions and paradoxes... it fixes everything. The evidence demonstrates a stationary earth.</p>

<p>This red pill should come in handy. Go ahead and take it; we&#39;ll be there by the time it kicks in...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha, some centuries ago scientists desperately tried to cling to the geocentric model by inventing ever more complicated epicycle theories. Similar to how scientists today struggle with trying to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>I will take a look at the sources though. It will be fun to debunk geocentrism.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t even try :-P </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been lurking there for quite some time, and... what can I say. You have valid concerns about relativity, you&#39;ll find good stuff over at <a href="/r/geocentrism">/r/geocentrism</a>, and enjoy the evidence they bring forward, imagine what if... they&#39;re right?</p>

<p>I do that often as a spiritual exercise. I ain&#39;t a believer, but right now I&#39;m in a split between expanding earth, hollow earth and holofractal/plasma/electric universe. </p>

<p>Anything but Einstein&#39;s mathemagical mess. He divides by zero a little too often for my taste. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The math in Einstein&#39;s relativity unable to deal with the velocity of photons was of course a limitation already from the beginning. It&#39;s a cop out. Also, Einstein&#39;s general relativity can&#39;t explain inertia, and they use some kind of more messy cop out for that.</p>
