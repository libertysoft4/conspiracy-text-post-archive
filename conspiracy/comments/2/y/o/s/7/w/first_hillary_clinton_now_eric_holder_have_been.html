    <div class="md"><p>I did a case study on Shell&#39;s operations in Nigeria while I was in college and what I learned really opened my eyes to the world around me and the way corporate power and governments abuse innocent people. At the time I was doing the case study I was reading Confessions of an Economic Hitman and it really just all came together for me.</p>

<p>I decided to make my username what it is in order to raise awareness about what happened.</p>

<p>For some context you can read this - </p>

<p>Shell Oil acting as a multinational global conglomerate and one of the largest companies on earth were paying bribes to government officials in Nigeria. They were paying the military to conduct raids on innocent protesters homes and ended up hanging innocent protest leaders in order to suppress the protesting against Shell.</p>

<p>My username is my attempt at education via a spoof on the Human Rights Abuses by Shell Oil in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.</p>

<hr/>

<p>For more information about Shell in Nigeria, please look at the sources below.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/dec/08/wikileaks-cables-shell-nigeria-spying">http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/dec/08/wikileaks-cables-shell-nigeria-spying</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The oil giant Shell claimed it had inserted staff into all the main ministries of the Nigerian government, giving it access to politicians&#39; every move in the oil-rich Niger Delta, according to a leaked US diplomatic cable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Saro-Wiwa">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Saro-Wiwa</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>His death provoked international outrage and the immediate suspension of Nigeria from the Commonwealth of Nations, as well as the calling back of many foreign diplomats for consultation. The United States and other countries considered imposing economic sanctions.</p>

<p>Beginning in 1996, the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), EarthRights International (ERI), Paul Hoffman of Schonbrun, DeSimone, Seplow, Harris &amp; Hoffman and other human rights attorneys have brought a series of cases to hold Shell accountable for alleged human rights violations in Nigeria, including summary execution, crimes against humanity, torture, inhumane treatment and arbitrary arrest and detention. The lawsuits are brought against Royal Dutch Shell and Brian Anderson, the head of its Nigerian operation.[15]</p>

<p>The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York set a trial date of June 2009. On 9 June 2009 Shell agreed to an out-of-court settlement of $15.5 million USD to victims&#39; families. However, the company denied any liability for the deaths, stating that the payment was part of a reconciliation process.[16] In a statement given after the settlement, Shell suggested that the money was being provided to the relatives of Saro-Wiwa and the eight other victims, in order to cover the legal costs of the case and also in recognition of the events that took place in the region.[17] Some of the funding is also expected to be used to set up a development trust for the Ogoni people, who inhabit the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.[18] The settlement was made just days before the trial, which had been brought by Ken Saro-Wiwa&#39;s son, was due to begin in New York.[17]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On June 8, 2009, Shell settled out-of-court with the Saro-Wiwa family for $15.5 million.[3][4] Ben Amunwa, director of the Remember Saro-Wiwa organization, said that &quot;No company, that is innocent of any involvement with the Nigeria military and human rights abuses, would settle out of court for 15.5 million dollars. It clearly shows that they have something to hide&quot;.[5]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>During the 9/11 Investigation, it came to light that Cheney and others were communicating using a secret communications system that was a part of the COG system. Cheney and Rumsfeld have been on the COG panel through several administrations, both democrat and republican. They had access to their own radar system that was tracking the hijacked planes and were able to communicate directly with the military leadership using secret communications.</p>

<p>I think many of these politicians are aware that the NSA is monitoring their communications and if they aren&#39;t on the inside, then they are trying to make sure that their communications are not intercepted and used against them. Not only is there a secret Government but there are multiple groups fighting for power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your trying to discredit the merits of the post based on a false Left-Right paradigm which is more transparent then ever.  I&#39;m absolutely positive that John Boehner,  Mitch McConnell,  Rand Paul, Ted Cruz,  Martin O&#39;Malley, Sarah Palin (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sarah-palin-e-mails-palin-maintained-third-e-mail-account/2011/06/11/AGc3ahQH_story.html">proven actually</a>, and every other politician striving for higher office has kept private emails,  and no matter Republican or Democrat,  it&#39;s wrong, and it proves my point, there is a secret government in place, likely on the state and local levels as well as the national level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not disagree on that there are many individuals in public office using private emails. Not just Republicans or Democrats or even Independents. But I don&#39;t see how this proves a &#39;secret government&#39; being in place. For fuck&#39;s sake - do you believe that Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, or Sarah Palin, and people as moronic as they are could possibly mastermind a secret government? Absolutely not. I think the truth is a lot more disturbing - policies that benefit corporations, big banks, defense contractors and warmongers, etc. are happening right in front of our faces with undet-the-table deals and heavy lobbying. Just look at the Koch brothers alone.. these fuckers don&#39;t need a &#39;secret government&#39;, they just <em>buy</em> the right politicians to pass favorable legislation and policy. I do agree there is another &#39;government&#39;, so to speak, controlling us - it&#39;s just not a secret at all, it&#39;s a fucking oligarchy plain and simple.</p>
