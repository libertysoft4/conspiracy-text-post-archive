    <div class="md"><p>Your 100% right. It&#39;s almost to huge for me to even grasp.. I mean, the amount of fucked up corruption in this world is beyond ridiculous. I wish I was some kind of superhero with the superpower to detect any fuckery and corruption. Magically teleport these sick fucks into a crater and wait for another fucking asteroid. I can&#39;t tell you how pissed and disgusted I am right now. I just watched a blacklist epipose where a billionaire had &quot;slaves&quot; , stolen art, kids, etc... for sale and it got me thinking. Went on a 3 hour research binge about epstein, Clintons involvement, uk&#39;s ring, and allllllll this other nonsense and fuckery that&#39;s floating around. I mean WHAT-THE-FUCK... I can&#39;t wrap my head around it. I knew some of these rich and powerful people and billionaires were some creepy fucks. I can&#39;t tell what&#39;s more mind blowing, thinking about ridiculous shit about the universe or thinking about these sick fucks walking around the planet </p>

    <div class="md"><p>still to be fair the powers that be do control the state the media and every institution inbetween... heck all we&#39;ve ever heard is lies crafted to make us the dumb slaves we are. Modern science is all about the money.  Carbon tax rules our understanding of climate ignoring the suns affect alltogether and blaming carbon that makes up less than .4% of the  atmosphere for every turn the weather takes. Modern medicine is practically worst than that of the middle ages ignoring real cancer cures for chemo profits. The media is a farce the news is nothing but propagandist. Same goes for the rest of it music sports movies all fake all contributing to the same propaganda. 
jus sayin the games kinda rigged against us why do you think they demonize people like conspiracy theorist. Never talk about things like the banking system being slaughtered recently in a canadian court.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like it&#39;s a secret that pedo-rings exist, they get busted often, and sometimes link to Global Elites, politicians, and other rich people.</p>

Satanism, murder, blood ritual, sacrifices; what if this is connected to the political pedophiles mess discovered after Jimmy Saville&#39;s death? What if this a systematic conspiracy from the police, state workers, politicians &amp; the Royal Crown &amp; church to cover it up? This could very well be the crime of the century.

<p>In short, those pedophiles are Satanic. Maybe you don&#39;t believe in Satan, but they do, and they believe that by hurting people, and innocents specifically, they get power.</p>

<p>By extension, our entire &quot;civilization&quot; is one of exploitation, degradation and destruction, of the people and the environment. To support this &quot;civilization&quot;, there is a tacit deal that is made to not watch how the &quot;sausage&quot; is made i.e. not inquire about conspiracies and why children go missing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You REALLY want to be disgusted?</p>

<p>REDDIT, the very forum that you post on, ALLOWS pedophile subs. They refuse to ban/remove them.</p>

<p>Want to be sick to your stomach? Check out <a href="/r/todcon">/r/todcon</a>. Check out <a href="/r/pomf">/r/pomf</a>. </p>

<p>TodCon...stands for &quot;toddler&quot;...con...whatever the hell &quot;con&quot; means...Its a sub that has drawings of TODDLERS in sexual situations and even having sex with adults. There is a proud bunch of sicko pedophiles there.</p>

<p>Look at <a href="/r/pomf">/r/pomf</a>. I don&#39;t know what that stands for, but its essentially the same thing...drawings of children in sexual situations...having sex with adults, etc...its disgusting and ILLEGAL.</p>

<p>Go there...then report them to Reddit. Ive done what I can but those subs are still there.</p>

<p>So I guess I&#39;m going to get called a pedophile on the internet today, but I think it can be justified in some way. Drawings are victimless. Stories, drawings, cartoons...the imagination has to be the last refuge of the truly twisted. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a long debate to be had about escalation vs. placation, and I&#39;d rather not do the whole thing, but the absolute worst thing about those subs, IMO, is that they attract people who would try to peddle <em>actual</em> child porn, with real victims.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually especially galling in this thread, about actual child molesters who are not limiting their experience to drawings.</p>

But I think you&#39;re right in that reddit is no place to treat such conditions. These people should be drawing images in the presence of a psychiatrist who can give them therapy. By making a social gathering out of this it might encourage them to act on their &#39;fantasies&#39;.

<p>You damn well know that its also ILLEGAL. Its not &quot;art&quot;, its kiddie porn. You damn well know that its wrong.</p>

<p>But you love the idea of fucking children so much that you will try to legitimize it by using the word &quot;Art&quot;...You can try to argue it, but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that you have or will molest a child or children in the future.</p>

<p>Why did you think that?  First of all, the FBI doesn&#39;t track any statistics for missing children.  The closest they come is tracking some statistics for people under 18, of which hundreds of thousands go missing each year.  Of these, the vast majority have their entries &quot;removed from the database&quot; but this says nothing as to whether the person was actually found or not, just that the entry was removed for some reason.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m wondering where you got that percentage from.</p>

They can be removed simply by being removed, at least for the FBI numbers.  Perhaps it is different in the UK but without a source for your claim I&#39;m going to assume not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does provide information of those who were found. Plain english, i did understand that, but underestimates are not the same as what youre claiming, youl have to be patient, im trying to compete in the sarcasm competition that is reddit so give me some time.. !</p>

<p>Why am I the one making the &quot;claim&quot; when all Im saying is that the UK isnt systematically covering up tens of thousands of missing people? And that the majority are found? Or at least, il believe it when i see some evidence. Thats a bit silly really, to say im making a claim. The majority are found, out of all those hundreds of thousands - and it makes sense, i know people who were teens and ran away. The data shows 15-17 year olds made a massive percentage. There are statistics every year by the relevant authorites that say as much, that the majority are found.</p>

<p>Where is this evidence that kids are removed from the database on a massive basis? I have one stance, yea, but if i see something like this then il change my opinion.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about for the UK, but this is the way it goes with the FBI&#39;s statistics which is the main reason I&#39;m skeptical about the UK&#39;s.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a link to their data for <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ncic/ncic-missing-person-and-unidentified-person-statistics-for-2014">2014.</a>  You&#39;ll see that a huge majority of the cases were &quot;canceled&quot; or &quot;removed&quot; but that this can be done at the discretion of the authorities and that no further details are provided for any of these specific cases.  When we&#39;re talking about over 600,000 missing people, many of them undoubtedly children, this is pretty significant in my opinion - especially in light of <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/pedophocracy.html">how huge this problem is.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think many older people are very causes of claims of mass child abuse or pedophile rings after what happened in the late 70&#39;s in Europe and later late 80&#39;s and early 90&#39;s in the US.</p>

<p>If you are too young to know what I am talking about or just never heard about for what ever reason here is a run down.  In the late 70&#39;s in Europe some people with in the Church started to push the idea that Europe was infested with satanists that were abusing and killing children.  After investigations  found no proof of it the idea fizzled out.  Then some religious people in the US started to make the same claims.  This lead to a big witch hunt that had some small town courts putting innocent people in a jail.  Then the FBI started to take notice and reviewed the cases.  Most people were later found to be innocent after going to a higher court.  Then came the people making claims they were abused by satanic cults, they made their rounds through the talk show circuit.   Most of these people that claimed to be abused had gone through some form of hypnosis to find suppressed memories.  Hypnosis used in this way was latter discredited much like today gay conversion therapy is.  Latter most of the people that claimed they were abused by a satanic cult admitted they had lied, but thought lying about it would bring more people to Jesus and lead to satanist all over the country being locked up.  This period of time is also called the great satanic panic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How long did it take before people in general, let alone catholics, could admit that the clergy were raping alter boys and then covering it up? This is the same thing. These people are trusted, elected (sometimes), famous and rich. It will be really hard to convince the average person that someone who rapes and murders children can be all of those things. It is even more difficult to convince them that there is a whole ring of elites who having been doing this for decades. </p>

<p>Personally it makes sense to me. The intelligence agencies have been making power grabs for years and by having dirt this big on political elites or corporate leaders they can pretty much control the government or major industries as they see fit. So they let these scumbags live their sick demented lives without punishment in exchange for near absolute power over their countries. In the eyes of MI6 or the CIA it is probably the lesser of two evils, a few kids are sacrificed but they can do so much more good by having the reigns of power taut in their hands. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they even tried to compensate parents at first and then eventually just turned to orphans and street children. This world is so disgusting sometimes.</p>

<p>Ritually abuse children? They should be hung. Sandusky and Jimmy Savile were thrown under the bus and thats all she wrote, Pedos caught, Abuse is stopped! Nothing to see here! No. The royals are involved, Clinton is connected, Jeffrey Epstein had 21 numbers to contact him FFS. Ya can&#39;t tell me Clinton knew nothing or saw nothing. </p>

<p>I know I mentioned hanging them. Thats terrible. But at the moment I just cannot feel love or forgiveness for them. Its something to strive for, to live life that way.

<p>You want people to do something, you need two options for people:</p>

<p>&quot;Rape/child abuse is bad and widespread. Let&#39;s address the problem generally. Here&#39;s what we can do:&quot;<br/>
&quot;Making these <em>specific</em> people accountable for their actions is important because:&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what the because is. If I want to stop kids from getting molested I don&#39;t see a particular reason to go after these people specifically. There&#39;s plenty of monsters to choose from, throughout society - it&#39;s not a class thing. If you want these people stopped, you&#39;re going to have to articulate the because.</p>

A lot of people couldn&#39;t stomach 9-11 but it served the establishment goals of creating fear very well so was pushed in the media ad-infinitum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These kids have seen some shit in the same way that kids during the satanic ritual abuse scandals of the 80s saw some shit. This is a 100% fabrication. The only issue is that these kids guardians are involving them in their messed up agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know when I read about this pedo ring and all the elite that were involved with it and it&#39;s connections with satanism; I can&#39;t help but recall some posts in the past suggesting that 9/11 was a satanic ritual on a grand scale (perpetrated by TPTB). </p>

<p>I&#39;ll be honest - I thought it was an interesting hypothesis, but total horseshit (the ritual part, I still believe 9/11 was an inside job). </p>

<p>Now with these pedo revelations coming out and the completely fucked up things that were allegedly done to kids in these rituals - the whole &quot;9/11 satanic ritual&quot; doesn&#39;t seem so far fetched...</p>

<p>Makes me sick to think about this stuff for too long.</p>
