In short, the people of Iceland peacefully overthrew the government and instated an entirely new body of politicians, and also began writing a new constitution. It began in 2008 after a national economic crash due to banking fraud very similar to what happened in the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to the world&#39;s economy, <em>moron yourself</em>, but to Iceland&#39;s economy. The banking sector in Iceland had swelled disproportionately  and by some measures outgrew the rest of the economy. And the government still managed to jail the CEOs and take over many of the private banks. The result was a short period of contraction and then period of rapid recovery, which is how any decent government can solve a financial crisis if it wants to.</p>

<p>The US government didn&#39;t coddle American banks because the politicians in charge cry at night thinking about how their actions might negatively affect the world economy. They coddled them because they sleep in the same beds and dine at the same restaurants and golf at the same country clubs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they were and are. But that&#39;s an extra incentive to fix them once and for all instead of letting the problems fester and spread. The world economy didn&#39;t immediately go into recession after Wall Street crashed in 2008. It took a couple years to really hit Europe and Asia. The trouble is that they&#39;ve stayed down since, with little recovery.</p>

<p>My main point is that those who made the decisions about the banks in 2008-2009 weren&#39;t concerned about the world. Letting your biggest financial institutions run on fraud without punishment isn&#39;t preserving stability, it&#39;s creating enormous risks down the road and rewarding criminal behavior. The market can&#39;t run without trust and fair rules.</p>

<p>Look this is a vicious circle. We have a very entrenched system of control all over the world that makes it very difficult to implement new ways of creating a society to the point that most movements become compromised by these control mechanisms.</p>

<p>Most countries share similar systems, yet have arrived upon them independently, and by the same trial and error. It&#39;s nothing to do with control, its to do with development. State control of the means of production and collectivization just didn&#39;t work very well, everyone just ended up poorer, so most countries switched to better systems and methods</p>

<p>All instances of communism were implemented in countries with a rapidly growing or bad economy because it was made to look good by politicians. In current historical reality, all communism attempts have failed due to three reasons. Political greed, unstable economy, and size of nation causing an uneven distribution of effort per point of effort given.</p>

<p>Hypothetically, a country could adapt communism if they could base income off of effort/ output, which would require a heavy infrastructure that would have to have near perfect judgement of work per person. This would give society a reason to put effort into work, making less slackers. The country would also have to be resource rich and able to import and export based on the needs of the people. Finally the country would need a rapidly moving political system with a relatively well informed voting population so that those serving in office would not be able to affect society in ways that would help them specifically(increase wage for senate, etc) and the best people could be placed in government as soon as possible. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget that the economy can&#39;t grow rapidly or the wealth distribution could be skewed based on which business is more important. And also that the more people, the harder to distribute wealth. Also pay scale has to change with the profession(reason for education and hit peak jobs, etc) and all prices be stabilized across the nation, or pay scale change from location to location to avoid rural vs urban prices. </p>

<p>So Communism is almost undoable in this day and age. Maybe at the point where infrastructure is so high that not everyone needs to have a job for a productive society would be the tipping point where communism beats socialism and capitalism, but perhaps not. I cannot say. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a James Bond film. Capitalism is just an economic system, the private ownership of the means of production. You set up a lemonade stand - that&#39;s capitalism.</p>

<p>However if the government collectively controls all the lemonade stands in the country - that&#39;s essentially Communism</p>

<p>The latter has been shown not to work so well.. because we thrive best in competition. Simple human nature. </p>

<p>Perhaps one day, Communism will work, but so far it hasn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Calm down son.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that I&#39;m lazy at all.  It&#39;s quite obvious that it&#39;s not hard to google.  Do you really think that people on reddit are so new to the internet that they don&#39;t know how to google?</p>

<p>How about you use that brain and think a little deeper.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll help you out - He&#39;s trying to inform us about something that happened years ago and at the same time he&#39;s also condemning the US media for not covering this story.  He provides zero links to support his claims.  </p>

<p>This can cause numerous issues with people reading contradictory sites/articles.  You should read the comments in this thread and you&#39;ll see that the story is not nearly as cut and dried as the OP makes it sound in his post.</p>

<p>THAT&#39;S what&#39;s annoying as hell.  </p>

<p>So...next time you feel the urge to jump on someone - pause and think deeper.  You don&#39;t win any internet points for being a jerk.</p>

<p>I would say that is exactly what happened here, it&#39;s hard to not call it a revolution. It&#39;s even known as the Kitchenware/Pots and Pans Revolution - indicating that while it may not be the type of revolution that we might all envisage, it was definitely still one.</p>

<p>It was not a revolution. There were some protests and the parliament decided to have an election early. There were no changes to the constitution or anything like that. </p>

<p>This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_election">happens regularly</a> in the world and is not a &quot;revolution&quot;. but if we want to classify this as a &quot;revolution&quot;, then there have been 7 revolutions in the UK since WW2, one in Germany in 2005, one in Spain in 2011, one in Sweden in 2015 and so on.</p>

<p>And the propagandists always say that what you just said. Almost like you are reading from their play book.</p>

<p>The results speak for themselves  </p>

<p>Look this is a vicious circle. We have a very entrenched system of control all over the world that makes it very difficult to implement new ways of creating a society to the point that most movements become compromised by these control mechanisms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most countries share similar systems, yet have arrived upon them independently, and by the same trial and error. It&#39;s nothing to do with control, its to do with development. State control of the means of production and collectivization just didn&#39;t work very well, everyone just ended up poorer, so most countries switched to better systems and methods</p>
