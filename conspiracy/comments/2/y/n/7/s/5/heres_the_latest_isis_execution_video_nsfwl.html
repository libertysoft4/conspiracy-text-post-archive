<p>Happens at around 9m or so.</p>

<p>In this one, it is said that an ISIS youngster is putting a bullet through the head of an Israeli spy or something.</p>

<p>It just looks so damn well-produced, etc.  I’ve seen a LOT of Mexican cartel beheadings, murders, etc…and they don’t look <em>anything</em> like this.  Even using a camera filming at a shit ton of frames per second, I would think that the bullet hole in the head of the person who is shot would have ruptured a <em>lot</em> more of their head/skull and not have been such a perfectly clean little hole with almost no blood coming out of it as is the case in the video.  Also, I recall little if any real kick back of the dude’s head as the bullet lands, etc.</p>

<p>Anyway…It might be real.  I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s definitely not…but there’s just so much b.s. and fuckery that’s been going on with this whole ISIS shit that it’s turned into a “Little boy who cried wolf” sort of thing with me where even if a real execution at the hands of ISIS <em>does</em> indeed take place, my first reaction would be to doubt the veracity of it at this point regardless.  TPTB are full of so much bullshit that one would be a fool <em>not</em> to doubt.</p>

<p>Also...this ISIS member putting a bullet through the head of an <em>Israeli</em> spy??  I mean...if this <em>really</em> happened...wouldn&#39;t Israel and Nutbagyahoo go fucking ape shit crazy and just start carpet bombing Palestine to no end or whatever?  He&#39;s obviously fucking insane already and bombs with little provocation.  Yet ISIS &quot;murdering a poor Israeli!!&quot; isn&#39;t all over the MSM?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your perception of entry bullet wounds comes from Hollywood crap. It&#39;s a small caliber bullet and the exit wound is the one that rips out a larger hole, not the entry one. Also up to a certain caliber there is little or no blood right as the bullet enters in the flesh, blood would start pouring out after a short delay. Also forehead consists of the skull bone, not much flesh in front.</p>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t.  It comes from watching dozens upon dozens of actual shootouts and assassinations online.  Didn&#39;t I mention that in the OP?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>But there was no &quot;larger exit hole&quot; anywhere.  It&#39;s not like the back of his head had a bigger hole or anything.</p>

<p>Regardless, nothing in what I mentioned above said &quot;This is a fake for sure!&quot;  I was just posing questions is all.  As I said, it might be real.  Regardless of whether it&#39;s real or not, however, the great production value in it actually works <em>against</em> its believability.</p>

And no, at close range with a FMJ bullet the entry wound would react just like his did.

<p>Yeah.  I was definitely thinking about that in particular.  The way the blood was pouring from the nose and mouth was a definite indication of at least some legitimacy.</p>

<p>Um...I wouldn&#39;t go <em>that</em> far.  We shouldn&#39;t be in the business of trusting almost <em>anyone</em> really.  ;)</p>
