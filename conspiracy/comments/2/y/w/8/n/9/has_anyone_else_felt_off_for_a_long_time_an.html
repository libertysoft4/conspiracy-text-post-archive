    <div class="md"><p>Do you get over that feeling, or do you just fill your day with so much crap going on (job, friends, family, etc) that you have no time to think about the bigger things going on in the world that originally led you to the feeling of doom? I suppose in one sense it wouldn&#39;t matter why, so long as you felt better, but isn&#39;t that taking the blue pill? To each his own, I&#39;m honestly wondering as I find myself in the same position as OP. I&#39;m often unable to think of other things, they lead back to the big problems. My kids? What is life going to be like for them in this world? As a parent, is it not my responsibility to worry about their future, even if it scares the shit out of me? Work? It&#39;s nice to know that even if I could find it I&#39;d just be a slave thanks to globalization. To fix the problems, it seems like we have to understand them first, and that takes research which causes concern and feelings of doom. I feel like this is a fire we have to go through whether we like it or not, it&#39;s that time in history.</p>

<p>*<em>if I came off as a dick I didn&#39;t mean to and apologize, was honestly asking. short of changing your views, i don&#39;t see how these things can leave the mind/not be bothersome. interested in your perspective.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you can endlessly learn about the greater ills in society and the world, but that&#39;s not necessarily gonna change the underlying problems we all face. The evils of globalization and the forces behind it are comprised of powers beyond our reach, and it&#39;s a sad fact, but we&#39;re basically at our rulers&#39; mercy. There will always be shitty powerful people who manipulate the world, and there will always be something terrible that we are powerless to stop. I would love to believe in some sort of huge revolution or even tangible effect we could have on the bigger picture, but that&#39;s only likely with people impacting what they can on a local and personal level. </p>

<p>With all this kind of stuff in mind 24/7, it&#39;s easy to get caught up in gloom and doom and feel like nothing but a slave. But the way I see it, letting shit like that affect you too much is just further giving in to the anxiety and paranoia that is bred by our modern culture.</p>

<p>The best way to free yourself is to revolt against the negativity. The powers that be may have control over the physical things, but they don&#39;t own our minds. Be happy IN SPITE of the terrible things that exist. Be grateful for all we do have, for the fact that we even have internet connections and a free forum to speak out against the government makes us lucky compared to many others in this world. It&#39;s easy to focus on everything evil and say &quot;things could be better&quot;, but it&#39;s another thing to accept that things could be much, much worse. </p>

<p>I know a lot of this is easier said than done type shit, but really if someone is filling their life with &quot;crap&quot; that includes job, friends, and family, is it really crap if they find a way to be happy through it? If I like to go make music with friends, is it bullshit because I&#39;m not constantly focusing on conspiracy-related stuff I have no power over? By some indirect machination, the powers that be effect pretty much everyone and everything, and there&#39;s no real way to physically remove yourself from it all short of living in a cabin in the wilderness. But what can we do? We can go on with our lives and enjoy times with ones we love.</p>

<p>I guess my point is that knowledge of the evils of the world doesn&#39;t necessarily condemn us to feeling like shit, unless you feed into the negativity of it all. I find it&#39;s good to balance out conspiracy-related stuff with any of the vast amount of other great and fulfilling things in the world. But retreating into the fear-mongering that not only exists in our media but in the conspiracy world is really no good way to live. </p>

<p>I think living in a way that spreads love/positivity is a better thing than dwelling on the evils that affect the bigger picture. Learn what you can....then move on. Can you do something about it? Even if something on a local level that you can do to improve your life and others, then try your best with that. But the kinds of giant conspiracies that involve things beyond your reach? It doesn&#39;t improve anyone&#39;s life to live in fear because of those things. If you let it effect your quality of living on a mental level, then that&#39;s another battle that they win. Don&#39;t let them get the satisfaction of fear, just laugh in their faces ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post! My counter-point would be this: Just as an example, suppose my children end up in a FEMA camp or genetically stunted due to some chemical or genetic diddling. Not arguing the legitimacy of these &quot;theories&quot;, just suppose <em>one</em> of them were true, and it affected my child&#39;s entire generation and possibly every one after. </p>

<p>My child will look back at me and say &quot;dammit dad, your generation let this happen.&quot; And he would be right! Just like my parents generation bought up the JFK b.s. and my grandparents the oil b.s. (Tesla, water engines, etc) and my great-grandparents Fed b.s. that has put us in this nearly helpless situation we&#39;re in now. But we&#39;re more helpless than our parents, and our children will be more helpless than us. </p>

<p>So what am I supposed to do with my responsibility as a father? I&#39;m pretty sure the people in Unit 731 in WWII weren&#39;t happy for the memories their parents had, they were thinking &quot;How in the hell did we get here? Who let this happen?&quot; Then they yelled a lot and could think no more. </p>

<p><em>IF</em> our situation is as dire as nearly any of these theories suggest alone, we have not only the responsibility but the necessity to try and fix it.</p>

<p>How is another question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree we should do all we can, but in terms of huge multi-layered conspiracies that run deep....the extent we can really have an impact is very little short of mass organization on a level we haven&#39;t seen yet. </p>

<p>I just think the extent some of us worry is disproportionate to how much impact we personally have. I&#39;m sure if something like FEMA camps happened, it would be hard to hold anyone like us personally responsible except for those that actually have the power to affect policy or those who help to implement it. But besides smaller steps we can take, worrying won&#39;t do anything except give you a headache and raise your blood pressure. We can all take action, but the evils of government aren&#39;t going away no matter what we do in our lives. We all do have a responsibility to do what we can, but that doesn&#39;t mean we need to spend our lives trapped in fear of something.</p>

<p>I mean I read so much messed shit about the CIA....but what can I do? I think 9/11 was basically a coup set up by elements within the government....but besides spreading knowledge and awareness, can I do anything about it? I could sit here and curse at them at get angry for as long as I want, but I would rather not spend my time wrapped up in their world of hatred and fear. I&#39;d rather worry about what I can have an actual impact on in my life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps mass organization is the only option left to free ourselves from systematic slavery and effect truly positive change in the course of the human race. One of our generations will inevitably be faced with this challenge. And looking at the world today it&#39;s hard to not think it has fallen on us. The world is a mess of pain and suffering caused by the insatiable greed and corruption of a very few. How much longer can it go on like this before we are pushed to the precipice where we would rather fight or die?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems to be a few posts lately about feelin&#39; so crap, particularly on account of the content of this sub! I was feeling very gloomy a few months ago, definitely because I was becoming too immersed in reading about conspiracies, politics, history, social science crap, economics, etc.</p>

<p>All these things are quite depressing when you are actually looking at the reality of everything, and particularly when you witness the spectacular hypocrisy of authorities and the ignorance of your average joe.</p>

<p>I decided that, since our thoughts create the world, garbage in garbage out etc., I should just force myself to think more about things that were more &quot;real&quot;. </p>

<p>So, I started instead to read good classic literature, started beefing my math skills back up with some khan academy, started learning about a new area of science (geology – in the past, I was a [crap] organic chemist), writing some articles for my blog, watching nature documentaries, learning about super ancient mythology especially about Australian aboriginals, etc. etc.</p>

<p>Specifically, I didn&#39;t want to hear about any current events, politics, Internet debates, any topic that gets corporate and govt. shills excited, etc.</p>

<p>I also started going on walks in natural settings, which tied in with the geology.</p>

<p>Long story a little less long – my spirits have really picked up. I worry far less about the state of the world and actually feel a sense of hope for my personal future.</p>

<p>I also keep trying to find those uncorrupted aspects of all people, even the &quot;sheep&quot; of this society. They might be uninformed and ignorant, and perhaps a lot of their world view has been corrupted by mis/disinformation, but there&#39;s still a lot of realness in everyday human existence.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the state you want to be in is one where you can feel enough hope and compassion for humanity that you still cherish it. Things have been far, far worse than they are now, and yet time and humanity marches on. We&#39;re just observers.</p>

<p>If you believe that we&#39;re all part of God and that, in fact, one&#39;s soul is the very same soul as God, then it must follow that for some reason, you (i.e., God) finds it worthwhile to look through the lenses of your eyes, to pay attention to what you&#39;re thinking and what you&#39;re feeling. If it wasn&#39;t, there&#39;d be no point.</p>

<p>So, there is something about the experience of you and your life that is interesting enough to spend a lifespan observing. If there wasn&#39;t, you&#39;d die or cease to exist or become nothing more than a soulless automaton.</p>

<p>My worry is that some people are, indeed, soulless automatons, but that&#39;s another story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s always impending doom somewhere, some place, some time. Unless it&#39;s something within your control, best to just try and do things that leave you happy and make your corner of the world a better place.</p>

<p>If that doesn&#39;t work, take this pill once in the morning, this one 3 times a day, and two of these when you go to sleep. If you don&#39;t immediately feel better we&#39;ll double your dosage and get you on a maintenance program to control any of those lingering negative feelings. This pill will also subdue emotional irritants that may be impeding your ability to work or socialize in a successful manner, and will keep you alert and obedient so that you can better synchronize your thoughts holistically with workplace structures. </p>

<p>Side effects include: Internal bleeding, frothy stool, contagious boils and rashes, dry teeth, and minor organ failure. Consult a doctor if your heart fails, or if you feel a permanent burning sensation behind your eyes or testicles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try to balance researching the negative aspects of life/the world/history/etc. with more positive ones.  There&#39;s balance in all things.  I&#39;ve been where you are mentally though, more than once, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be back at some point.  It sounds cliche but there&#39;s no going back, you can&#39;t un-know some of these things and I don&#39;t think you should want to even if you could.</p>

<p>As Terence McKenna put it, &quot;To be well adjusted to an insane society is the very definition of insanity. To keep one&#39;s sanity, in this society, one must develop a certain level of alienation.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to feel that way, thinking some impending doom was on the way. Year after year, not much a happened that was not pretty much the same. Granted, if you are living in a country at war such as Syria, the end of times might seem near. But as an American, you eventually get over that feeling once you get out meet people and develop a career. </p>
