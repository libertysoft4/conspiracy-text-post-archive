        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This video clearly shows the two Brothers arriving with backpacks and leaving without them. It&#39;s as clear as day. Please watch the whole video before commenting.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqaGJ50Cz7o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqaGJ50Cz7o</a></p>

<p>Could not be more incriminating</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqaGJ50Cz7o&amp;t=7m45s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqaGJ50Cz7o&amp;t=7m45s</a></p>

<p>I like conspiracies, and I agree with a whole bunch of them. I believe in aliens, sacred geometry, and I&#39;m definitely open minded about how this planet came together. I also think that the government is about as corrupt as can be. I hate Monsanto, and I think the whole planet is run by bankers who are part of a secret society. So don&#39;t ridicule me as some sheep.</p>

<p>Please, from someone who was at the RedSox game that day and was around all this chaos, I find it offensive when people who have never been to Boston tell me that it never happened. Or that they were not responsible for it, or that the government did it so they could practice martial law.</p>

<p>I was there, it did happen. As a community Boston came together. We looked towards our local government to find these pricks, and they did. IMO we have some of the best police in the country.</p>

<p>There is no doubt in my mind that the Tsarnaev Brothers at least psychically committed this crime. Whether or not they were brainwashed, or blackmailed into this. That can be debated if need be.</p>

Would you deny a locked and loaded swat force in full tactical armor from entering your home? I&#39;m willing to bet from your responses that you wouldn&#39;t. The footage/images don&#39;t lie. It&#39;s not difficult to do a google search and witness how unconstitutional these searches were. &quot;There was no pointing of guns&quot; is your opinion and far from fact.  </p>

<p>No they didn&#39;t, the owner of the boat found blood on the boat and tipped the cops off. So much for martial law and the cops kicking doors down. That was martial law practice, as Ram Rod Emannuel says &quot;never let a crisis go to waste&quot;. They did not have to do what they did, but they pounced on it.</p>

<p>I saw that he put the bag down, but I didn&#39;t see if THAT bag exploded, I just saw an explosion. A device could&#39;ve been planted there and he didn&#39;t know because maybe he thought he was apart of a drill. There was a drill going that day. Once they realized it wasn&#39;t a drill, and there was explosions. They high tailed it out, they were getting framed for it. Could be no?</p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to see the video feed after the fade to black. Why are so many videos fading to black these days. After the video fades to black it should show the evidence of damage. They need to release that, before I make up my mind. His demeanor is too casual about have a bomb on his back. One shoulder strap? You&#39;d think he be little more &quot;protective&quot; of it.</p>

<p>edit: a for his brother, I&#39;d like to see more video.</p>

<p>edit2: In the pictures that show his face, he is standing in front of the tree, yet the video always shows him behind the tree. What&#39;s up with that? So we have him standing there with his back turned, and they show us still images of him from the front in a different spot. What&#39;s up with that?</p>

<p>Also, they didn&#39;t literally kick down doors either. You have no idea, you aren&#39;t from this area. It&#39;s easy to make assumptions when you are just watching this shit on TV. the only people who cared that they were searching houses where people like you watching from your basement. The people in the community did not give a damn. They just wanted these guys captured. We took care of our own business. That is why we wanted him to get prosecuted here and not have him locked up in Cuba.</p>

<p>Ordering people out of their homes at gunpoint and the threat of violence is abusive. I don&#39;t know what sick fucking fantasy-land you live in but there is nothing &quot;calm&quot; about a stacked column of heavily armed and armored assholes coming to people&#39;s front porches, back yards, pressing against doors and windows, aiming automatic weapons at people filming, and barking orders at families inside their homes to comply or face the consequences. And to look to one&#39;s right and left and see the same thing happening to neighbors? Oh yes. So calm. Officer Friendly with a few benign questions, right? Must be so. <strong><a href="http://imgur.com/a/AawEe">After all, you claim to live in the area and say that no police pointed any guns at anyone, and that they were not abusive.

    <div class="md"><p>They are and they aren&#39;t. A job of a conspiracy theorist is to act like a detective and question all angles. If something is off in your gut, you need to look at it. His demeanor is off to me, would you be carrying a backpack which they say had an (touchy too) explosive device in it like that? I wouldn&#39;t, that makes me question. The fact that they didn&#39;t show footage after the explosion also makes me question. Because then we could see the area of where he dropped his bag. If it was his bag, it wouldn&#39;t be there. But unfortunately for us, they didn&#39;t release the full clip. That&#39;s a little suspicious. I&#39;m not saying nothing happened that day, I&#39;m just questioning.</p>

<p>He looked calm prior to the explosion, after the explosion he was too far away to see what he looked like. What are you talking about? Being framed comes in after finding out it was a setup way after the explosion and way out of camera site.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, what I said was that a device could have been planted that he didn&#39;t know about. He had a prop in his bag, (ie being calm) and careless with it. He dropped his bag (dud bomb), next to the real thing he didn&#39;t know about. He heard the first &quot;explosion&quot; got the cue to start walking away from the next &quot;explosion&quot;. Later they find out, this shit was real and freaked the fuck out. That&#39;s my theory as I stated. Maybe I wasn&#39;t clear, my bad. Whether it&#39;s true or not, idk.

<p>The video evidence is clear. You can choose to ignore it and make conclusions that are way more far fetched. Maybe they were brainwashed, but they definitely are responsible.</p>

<p>I can only go off what people told me. Yes the photos show officers pointing guns at houses and windows. But that is what they are trained to do. It&#39;s not like they were pointing them at people who opened the doors and let them in without giving them grief. What my friends who live in the area told me is more valuable than the stories you make up in your head.</p>

<p>There is no doubt in my mind that the Tsarnaev Brothers at least psychically committed this crime.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I saw in the <em>government released videos</em> are <em>glitches</em>, an all out <em>black out</em> at one point and <em>smoke and mirrors</em>. </p>

<p>An <em>outlier</em> in Todashev... Brutally murdered in his own home, in America, by FBI agents.</p>

<p>Were the Tsarnaev brothers recruited by nefarious US <em>black ops</em>? Ask their Aunt, an Attorney. Ask their Uncle. </p>

<p>Fuck! Ask your government! </p>

<p>You decide!</p>

<p>Todashev was murdered by the FBI (or other forces...) in cold blood:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/03/2">www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/03/2</a>!    </p>

<p>(Not sure this link will work. My cell froze up, my desktop as well but this SB the Boston Globe link to Todashevs Murder!) FWIW</p>

<p>There&#39;s so much more to this fabrication! </p>

<p>If I were you, I would start with the <em>Original Attack On the WTC Complex</em> and the original Muslim <em>patsy</em> spawned by the US whores of MORE MONEY.</p>

<p>TuxYouUp,</p>

<p>My nine grandsons, the four + kids I was responsible for creating and or raising, all the added lives are exponential, dynamic!</p>

<p>America hasn&#39;t seen the horror of War on the Scale of War, since Her Infancy. </p>

<p>Imagine Boston Strong in the face of The True Terrorists!</p>

<p>Chilling. </p>

<p>Boston folds. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not now nor will I ever condone War, War Crimes, Espionage, Traitors.</p>

<p>I will not bend a knee.</p>

<p>Edit: Fast as I could. <em>Page not Found</em>. Imagine that.</p>

<p>Yes, seems he was the one who planted the second bomb.</p>

<p>But I can&#39;t see the other guy leaving the bag down anywhere in the video.  Just that he was at the finish line.</p>
