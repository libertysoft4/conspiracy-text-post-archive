        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here is an example of supposedly an atom bomb explosion: 1946 Atomic Bomb Test at Bikini Atoll -- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RID9_msrmU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RID9_msrmU</a></p>

<p>Notice that the clouds near the explosion remain intact after the event. Pretty sturdy clouds.</p>

<p>Here is another example with better video quality: Original Colour Film of Baker Atom Bomb at Bikini Atoll 1946 in HD -- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4njDofokYs&amp;t=25s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4njDofokYs&amp;t=25s</a></p>

<p>There is a large condensation cloud appearing. This is also known as a Wilson cloud:</p>

<p>&quot;In humid air, the drop in temperature in the most rarefied portion of the shock wave can bring the air temperature below its dew point, at which moisture condenses to form a visible cloud of microscopic water droplets.&quot; -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensation_cloud">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensation_cloud</a></p>

<p>The dew point at the location and time of the explosions could hardly have been more than around 30 degrees Celsius: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew_point#mediaviewer/File:Dewpoint.jpg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew_point#mediaviewer/File:Dewpoint.jpg</a></p>

<p>The heat radiation from an atom bomb is supposed to reach millions of degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>So we have ordinary clouds being unaffected by the alleged atom bomb explosions and large condensation clouds forming. That indicates that conventional explosives have been used to fake atom bomb explosions.</p>

<p>In the case of the Bikini Atoll tests, huge amounts of TNT can have been loaded into ships and detonated. Here is a smaller version with &quot;only&quot; 100 ton TNT, May 1945, Alamogordo, New Mexico: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VANyY87-_Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VANyY87-_Q</a></p>

<p>There is also the possibility that smaller explosions have been made to look larger by double exposure of film. Another trick is to film at night to make the light from conventional explosions appear brighter. And model buildings blown up in slow motion. Here is a sequence where a building is destroyed without the camera shaking: Atomic Bomb Test; Operation Cue from 1955 (Original version) -- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr76hNngqts&amp;t=10s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr76hNngqts&amp;t=10s</a></p>

<p>The stable camera shows that the building may have been a model and not a real house nor a real nuclear explosion.</p>

<p>The Trinity crater has radial lines that should align in a center point but are in reality far from aligning: <a href="http://s27.postimg.org/m4gkml5w3/trinity_crater.jpg">http://s27.postimg.org/m4gkml5w3/trinity_crater.jpg</a></p>

<p>The radial lines are therefore not from an explosion and have been added manually.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you honestly believe that ONE BOMB that destroyed a whole city would show NO SIGNS of a blast crater or shockwave?
The blast would be coming from ONE SOURCE in all directions. It does not matter how high it was dropped.
If ONE BOMB destroyed a whole city then the aftermath would show, but it doesn&#39;t.
In fact, Hiroshima and Nagasaki look identical to the Tokyo firebombings that happened just prior in 1945, there are several people who have testified to this fact. One of the prominent voices debunking the nuclear strike is  Alexander P. de Seversky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fission in a nuclear power plant is held at a slow rate. In a nuclear explosion, the fission is supposedly going super fast because of a critical mass, but how can the mass be kept together to achieve supercriticality to explode? Exploded fission material becomes separated and will be unable to uphold the same level of supercriticality as in the supposed start of the explosion.</p>

<p>Another even more outrageous conspiracy theory is that even nuclear power plants are a hoax. That&#39;s potentially tinfoil hat territory, ha ha, but who knows. Maybe some nuclear power plants (boiling water reactors) are just water boilers to stabilize the electric grids, and others (pressurized water reactors) are in reality water fuel cell plants, using secret water-splitting technology.</p>

<p>That being said, the moon landings were also a hoax, but we do have the technology to travel there. Just not the technology as described to the public.</p>

And that kind of technology probably needs to be suppressed and kept secret not only to keep the real knowledge in the classified world, but also because such technology could be dangerous in the hands of the public, such as easily being used for making very powerful weapons.</p>
