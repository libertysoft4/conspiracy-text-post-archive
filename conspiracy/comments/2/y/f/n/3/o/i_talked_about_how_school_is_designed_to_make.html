    <div class="md"><p>Hooky fucking Christ I didn&#39;t read all of that but I saw a very common pattern. The quoting and then smearing tactic without addressing the actual conversation is exactly what I&#39;m taking about. I&#39;ve engaged a few of these people before I realized I was experiencing what so many posts on this sub were talking about. Now you have as well. It seems to be related more to key words like they are searching until there&#39;s a hit and then engage in a seemingly benign debate until they&#39;ve been proven wrong. I defended someone on a comment about Jewish control because it was an objective, well written comment, despite not necessarily agreeing with it. I made no mention of my own beliefs. What followed was one of the worst, most relentless and verbally abusive attacks I&#39;ve experienced on the net. Stonewalling and character demeaning are common. After stating I was defending him, it still persisted. Someone even gilded one of his comments that had nothing to do with the original debate and only contained text that was personally diminishing and slanderous toward myself. I after a couple more of these conversations, I try not to even read about racy subjects much less comment on them. I&#39;m trying to learn and constructively debate things because I enjoy learning. When it&#39;s not enjoyable anymore it&#39;s not worth it.</p>
