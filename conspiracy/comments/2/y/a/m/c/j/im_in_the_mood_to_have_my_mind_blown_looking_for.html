<p>That&#39;s because what&#39;s ultimately greater and more powerful than knowledge alone is having the ability to actually know how to <em>use</em> that knowledge effectively.  That is what is called wisdom.</p>

<p>Together we stand.  Divided we fall.  And the elite work very hard at making sure and keeping the population <em>very</em> divided amongst itself.  Much easier to control people that way.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that the majority of us have not apparently understood this truth and keep fighting amongst ourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have a long way to go collectively.  I guess I just try to do my best to keep <em>myself</em> as educated and intelligent and wise as possible.  That is absolutely <em>no</em> easy task, to say the least, considering I&#39;m no more wise an intelligent than the average person...so I stumble and fall and make mistakes often.</p>

<p>I get back up and still keep trying though...</p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/gcD1h9DYitg">http://youtu.be/gcD1h9DYitg</a></p>

<p>Very interesting on many levels. He is a founder of the Unbuntu Movement and Political party in Africa.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.michaeltellinger.com/ubuntu-cont.php">http://www.michaeltellinger.com/ubuntu-cont.php</a></p>

<p>He goes through many ancient structures in Africa left unnoticed by most archaeologists, has some interesting theories on these structures being free energy machines, and introduces the Unbuntu Movement in this talk. There is more to it but those are the basic points. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. This was well worth the two hours to watch. He brings up a lot of concepts and theories related to ancient technologies perhaps or intentionally hidden by modern archeology. I also like the paradigm shifting ideas he provides with the Unbuntu movement. I am not for or against anything, Unbuntu included. But the concept made my mind spin with future possibilities and potentials. I can see how some of his theories might come off as David Ickes-ish, but well presented nonetheless. </p>

If there is an active movement to suppress truths and newly defined paradigms of truths, then it must be worth watching. No matter the differences, Nassim Haramein, Tellinger, Roth and Melchezidek are all redefining supposed truths in science and beyond. The same can be also said for the AMA by Linda Brown, daughter of Thomas Townsend awhile back. </p>

He goes through American history and picks stuff apart like Israel Bissel was the guy that rode the farthest to warn or the British coming, but Paul Revere was the one who was accredited with the ride even though he rode something like a third of the distance. &quot;When legend becomes fact, print the legend&quot; is kind of the theme of the videos.

<p>I think this one is a must for anyone curious about what&#39;s really going on.  Heavy with history and figures, they follow the money, connect the dots, and ponder the origins and mechanisms of the black financial world.  That&#39;s the dark heart of the Cabal, without the financial, they lose everything.  And if you listen closely you can catch a glimpse of the global collateral accounts.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the seventh installment of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEA05F393EC843D80">9/11 - The Great American Psy-Opera</a> documentary created in 2011 by Colin Alexander. He&#39;s a musician/special effects dude who&#39;s done work for movies and television shows. </p>

<p>This certain one reveals the unpopular theory that there were no planes on 9/11. Which to me he proves it by cross examining live video footage, and revealing lies from the guy who filmed it, plus much more. </p>

<p>The whole documentary is four hours long and worth it.</p>
