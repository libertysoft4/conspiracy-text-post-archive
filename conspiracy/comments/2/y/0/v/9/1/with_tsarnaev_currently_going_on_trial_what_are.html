<p>Planned on skipping this so thanks for the warning, but it turned out to be pretty fucking funny because of the accent.  I&#39;ll report back in 5 hours with more opinions.  </p>

<p>He makes a really good point right after the 4 hour mark.  The interview with 60 Minutes when that lady is describing security cam footage of Tsarnaev walking up and dropping a backpack, everyone&#39;s heads turn towards the first bomb except his, then he walks off.  His point being why the fuck would you have her describing the video rather than showing it.  Now with his attorney coming out that the video may not exist it all comes together.</p>

<p>The rest of this is pretty good lot of details I definitely missed and haven&#39;t seen before.  But I would hope a 5 hour video would have a lot of fucking detail.  Few things here and there that I disagree with, few things I noticed that could have been added, but overall pretty solid.  Dude really hates that Jeff Baumann photo.</p>

<p>FBI beats his brother to death in custody.. Subtle huh?</p>

<p>They questioned his acquaintance in his house too.. They ended up shooting him in the neck and killing him in his own house. Sounds legit.</p>

<p>Oh the Craft agents at the marathon? Crisis actors? Unbelievable medical anomalys - double femoral with conciousness.. Carlos Arredando - the &#39;hero in a cowboy hat&#39;, known FBI asset with forged credentials caught on film waiting to act on signal. </p>

<p>The dead FBI agents, the dead BPD.. All the people who just happened to see Tsarnaev before being taken into custody. What did Tsarnaev tell them? -They were being set-up.</p>

<p>This whole case is a big False flag.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most government conspiracies will coincide with an exercise of the same event going on at the same place and time as the &#39;real&#39; event.</p>

<p>This is to provide deniability in case they are caught red handed in the act. The odds against such an exercise  occurring during such a tragic event are a million to one. The odds against it happening multiple times are astronomical.</p>

<p>9/11 was accompanied with several such exercises.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_government_operations_and_exercises_on_September_11,_2001">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_government_operations_and_exercises_on_September_11,_2001</a></p>

<p>So were many of the other  crimes against America perpetrated in pursuit of personal greed by  operatives  within government . The Boston Bombing was one such event.</p>

<p>We  have the picture of the bag that the FBI says exploded and it does not match either of the Tsarnaev brother&#39;s bags.</p>

<p><a href="https://postmediacanadadotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/bomb2.jpg">https://postmediacanadadotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/bomb2.jpg</a></p>

<p>Who did it? A pop quiz for those in doubt.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/XaFGwXG.png">http://i.imgur.com/XaFGwXG.png</a></p>

<p>These guys did it.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/pMPFUg7,tXqro2p#1">http://imgur.com/pMPFUg7,tXqro2p#1</a></p>

<p>Here you see the government agent from Craft International, a division of Blackwater (by any name), carrying the bag to the place where it was to explode.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/pMPFUg7,tXqro2p#0">http://imgur.com/pMPFUg7,tXqro2p#0</a></p>

<p>That covers the information concisely of who what and where, why is to get firmer control of the population and to reduce their rights.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t go to a concert locally now carrying any kind of backpack for instance, if I do I&#39;m regarded as a potential terrorist, where the truth would be that I might be carrying my own refreshments rather than buying them at the venue.</p>

<p>back to the Boston bombing info,</p>

<p>There&#39;s much more to know, like the fact that a government exercise of the same thing was happening at the same time and place (for cover in case they were caught red handed)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I simply didn&#39;t rewrite what was on the picture  or tamper with it in any way. It is what it is.</p>

<p>&quot;Israeli looking&#39; is the opinion of the creator of the depiction, although his appearance is not inconsistent with that assessment. Personally I think he is one of the two similar agents seen behind the truck and that they both look  mongoloid.</p>

<p>What matters is that the  government agent is carrying a container matching the bomb container, the Tsarnaev&#39;s are not.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s so fake that the only reason you don&#39;t know it&#39;s fake is because you haven&#39;t seen the evidence&quot;</p>

<p>The entire event was scripted - they told runners there was a disaster at the finish line right as the head of the pack was approaching it, then they detonated the firecracker and got crisis actors and amputees in position.  Fake blood everywhere, very plain to see.  There are also examples of windows blowing out toward the blast.  The wounds people are alleged to have suffered make no sense, there&#39;s footage of actors tearing their pants.  There&#39;s a woman with a preposterous doll over shoulder on a walkie talkie the whole time.</p>

<p>There&#39;s more evidence too.  Thats why Dzokhar Tsarnaev&#39;s lawyer says there&#39;s no footage implicating his client.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still like the original theory. Tsarnaev and his brother were being trained to be used over seas. For some reason they were put into the risk category. Once they became operational risks they were assigned as unaware patsies in this operation. The guy in the car with them was most likely some type of handler.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even think it&#39;s a coincidence that the brothers ended up in the neighborhood they did. I think that neighborhood was picked for door to door searches.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll go into it if you want, but I followed this closely when it happened, and realized really quickly that the narrative was being managed by a specialized office in the FBI through CBS news and Boston dot com.</p>

<p>I immediately called out the inconsistencies in the FBI story and eventually they all dissipated. One of the final inconsistencies that they have yet to take back is that he wrote a manifesto in the boat.  I&#39;m sure we will eventually learn that is not true.</p>

<p>I also found the twitter and facebook accounts for both suspects, and they are both very aware of false flags.  The older brother was probably recruited by the atlanticist wing of the CIA (his uncle is jamestown foundation, as is the professor at the younger brother&#39;s school).</p>

<p>This was a black operation.  It&#39;s possible that the russians were involved and likely that the CIA had ties here.  It&#39;s for sure that there is a group working within the FBI&#39;s counterterrorism office that is managing the PR very closely, and running some very suspect drills.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen one single piece of evidence against him, other than he had a backpack and was in the vicinity. I&#39;m surprised not one video has surfaced of him walking through the crowd before the explosion besides the video with the yellow balloons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, his lawyer said he did it but they are still trying for not guilty.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an explanation from a lawyer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Think of it this way...let&#39;s say that I&#39;m charged with first-degree murder only. There are several ways I can beat the charge. I can show that I didn&#39;t actually kill someone. I can show that although I did kill someone, it wasn&#39;t premeditated. I can show that although I did kill someone, I had an adequate justification (self-defense, defense of others). If the jury accepts any one of these, it&#39;s not guilty. The first two defenses go to elements of the offense, the last is what&#39;s called an affirmative defense...basically even if the government proves its case, there&#39;s a reason to not convict.</p>

<p>In this case, Tsarnaev is arguing some type of lack of intent. It&#39;s a crappy argument, but really he has nothing to lose. The Feds weren&#39;t going to take the death penalty off the table in this case, so there was no point in plea bargaining. I believe the defense attorney is playing the long game here...she knows that the real action is going to be in sentencing, and so she&#39;s using the trial (which will almost certainly result in a guilty verdict) to set up the argument that she might have a snowball&#39;s chance of winning...that even though Tsarnaev did an evil thing, he was basically manipulated into doing it, and so his life should be spared.</p>
