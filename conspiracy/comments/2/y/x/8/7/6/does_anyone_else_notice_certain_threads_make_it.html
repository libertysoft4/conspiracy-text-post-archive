<p>On the front page of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> two of the top ten links are:</p>

<p>TIL that when a Holocaust denial group offered $50,000 dollars to &quot;prove that Jews were gassed at Auschwitz,&quot; a camp survivor, Mel Mermelstein sent them definitive proof. When they refused to pay, he sued them and was given $90,000 when the court noted, &quot;It is simply a fact.”</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>German anti-vaccer wagers € 100,000 to anyone proving the existance of the measles virus. Researcher sends him articles proving the virus&#39; existance and takes him to court where he&#39;s ordered to pay the full amount.</p>

<p>So has anyone here really tracked these topics and how often they make it to the front page?  It does seem to happen in  predictable cycles.</p>

<p>Why is a discussion of Jewish crimes and wrong-doings and excesses and insanities an &quot;unhealthy obsession&quot; with Jews? Aren&#39;t Jews as valid a topic of debate as any other topic under the sun? And if you think they are not, then why would you think that?</p>

<p>Makes me wonder if they&#39;re paying people to act like nutty anti-vaccers which was originally about criticism of one vaccine.  </p>

<p>Is this the next level of PR?  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Pay people to act like they&#39;re are against you in an imbecilic way.  </p></li>
<li><p>Make a fuss about it in court and the media.   </p></li>

<p>Social stigmatization of dissent will be the top method of control thanks to social media.  Facebook seems to have made people feel like celebrities so they&#39;ll do anything to not look bad in the public eye.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously people care about the holocaust, your anecdotal evidence means very little. The fact that it gets more publicity than others is not down entirely to the involvement of the Jews, it was also perpetrated by Nazi Germany, an iconic &quot;bad guy&quot; group, and it has a catchy name attached to it. If nobody cares about the holocaust, how are all of us aware of it in greater detail than most of the other genocides that you ambiguously mentioned?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your question cannot be answered with a &quot;yes&quot; or a &quot;no&quot;. The reality is more complex. The Holocaust, as we understand it today, is a myth. That is to say, it is a fictional narrative that has evolved from a number of actual, real events that have been magnified, distorted, misrepresented, or outright falsified. The Holocaust began with stories traded by Jews inside the concentration camps. It was carried forward by the Allied propaganda  designed to depict the Nazis as inhuman monsters. It was further magnified when Jews realized that it could be used as a weapon to extract money from Germany and other nations, to quell criticism of Jewish behavior, and to insulate Israel from public criticism.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a case of &quot;did the Holocaust happen or not?&quot; That question is meaningless. Some of the events that gave rise to the Holocaust mythology did occur. Some did not occur. Some were distorted by hysteria, or deliberately lied about for reasons of personal advantage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>copypasta:</p>

<p>Depends on how you define it.
If you define it by the common definition today of intentional extermination of 6 millions jews. Then no, it didn&#39;t happen.
Lots of people were put into slave labor camps, and many died towards the end of the war due to starvation and typhus, but there was never an intentional program of extermination. The actual facts support this conclusion.

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously people care about the holocaust, your anecdotal evidence means very little. The fact that it gets more publicity than others is not down entirely to the involvement of the Jews, it was also perpetrated by Nazi Germany, an iconic &quot;bad guy&quot; group, and it has a catchy name attached to it. If nobody cares about the holocaust, how are all of us aware of it in greater detail than most of the other genocides that you ambiguously mentioned?</p>
