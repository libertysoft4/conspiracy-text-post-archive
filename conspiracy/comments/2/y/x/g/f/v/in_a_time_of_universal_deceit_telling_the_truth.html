        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I often hear truthers lament the fact that the message isnt getting out despite the overwhelming evidence of malfeasance. (my personnal favorite 911 clip  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IYlEVCpG_0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IYlEVCpG_0</a> ).
 How do you be the change you say you want to see?</p>

<p>This is what you do. You confirm the truth with real people in face to face meetings. And not just your friends and family but more importantly you confirm the truth with strangers. Like the store clerk or fast food worker or anyone and everyone you meet in your daily life. Just ask / tell them &quot; you do know that 911 was an inside job right?&quot;
 See what they say, if they agree then the truth is confirmed and you have begun a public movement . If they look at you funny or deny then dont try to convince them about 911 just ask them : &quot;well you do know that all US presidents are related, right &quot;
 Since they dont believe 911 truth they probably won&#39;t believe this either , but you can tell them to google it .<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rng4Xx3iMeI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rng4Xx3iMeI</a> 
Once they see that you were right about this simple fact they will be much more receptive to the truth of 911. Also they will be much more sceptical of the workings of government.
Most important thing is to talk to  people face to face . We internet users and posters over estimate the importance of online dissemination of truth.
 So you have to actually pin people down on their beliefs and perhaps let them know that others validate their beliefs as well. One of the first things I tell strangers when I meet them is that 911 was an inside job and that I dont believe we walked on the moon anymore.
 I dont have any friends but ive had some interesting discussions with strangers. The point is , you dont need to take up arms to be a revolutionary, but you should be willing to get punched in the nose for a controversial belief. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wptn5RE2I-k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wptn5RE2I-k</a></p>

<p>This video released by NASA about the upcoming Orion space exploration craft, shows a NASA scientist admitting that they still haven&#39;t worked out how to properly shield the spacecraft from the radiation emitted from the Van Allen belts.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlXG0REiVzE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlXG0REiVzE</a></p>

<p>I believe the moon race was really a race for intercontinental balistic missile technology and that once the US had the capabilities they were looking for they decided to put warheads on the rockets and aim them at the russians instead of wasting time, energy, and lives puting men on those warheads .</p>

<p>If you are in a cold war with an enemy that has threatened you with nukes you dont waste resources on esoteric needs when the countries defense was at stake.  We had missile silos to build and bomber bellies to fill and even sub marines to supply with the latest guidance systems available.  We didnt have time to jump over pie in the sky technology hurdles when there were real national defense needs that were underfunded and behind schedule.
The idea that you are going to drive a go cart around on the moon is absurd.  Why not one picture of them unloading it . Must have taken hours.  And to top it off we dont have any blueprints or specs of ANYTHING... they were all lost ... boo hoo .</p>

<p>Believe what you want but nasa cant even help themselves verify the truth anymore.  Im done .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also started questioning the moon landing more, recently. I refused to do that for the longest time, because as a kid, the moon landing was my favorite story to read over and over again, so much that I went on to get a degree in aerospace engineering. I am still researching this, and have not reached a definitive conclusion yet, but things are definitely looking fishy especially with the Van Allen radiation belts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You dont need a moon landing to reflect a laser off the moon .</p>

<p>The first successful tests were carried out in 1962 when a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology succeeded in observing laser pulses reflected from moon&#39;s surface using a laser with a millisecond pulse length. Similar measurements were obtained later the same year by a Soviet team at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory using a Q-switched ruby laser.[1]

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s jumping to a conclusion that&#39;s not necessarily stated by OP.  Not saying he <em>doesn&#39;t</em> feel what you alleged, but it seems the real point of his including that link involved stating that one should be willing to stand up for something they feel even if it gets met with great resistance by others.

    <div class="md"><p>No need to apologize.  I was the one who erred here - not you.  I was referring to the last statement OP made and assumed that this is where you were getting your own response from.  The statement of his that you quoted here shows that he does indeed believe that the moon landing was a hoax.  As such - regardless of whether the moon landing <em>was</em> indeed a hoax or not - I was incorrect in stating that it shouldn&#39;t be assumed that OP doesn&#39;t think we landed on the moon.  He, in fact, <em>does</em> think that, as he directly stated it.</p>

<p>I quickly skimmed what he said and clicked on the links without having read the one section that you quoted here.</p>

<p>Therefore, and again, I was in the wrong in the response I gave above.  Apologies.  :)</p>

<p>Do not mix NIST&#39;s coverup with moon landing obscurity. Sounds like a discrediting/disinformation campaign </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  Just another propaganda lie on top of all the other lies.  The Japanese sent a high def satellite up 5 years ago, where are the pics of the landers?  A lot of the &#39;moon&#39; rocks that were given out were from earth.  To get that much weight up there and back would require much larger rockets. It&#39;s a fanciful tale to keep people distracted from reality.  </p>

<p>I will go on:</p>

<p>No place to take a crap for 7 days.</p>

<p>How did they take off from the lunar surface in that lander?  How come not pics of anything being assembled.</p>

<p>No stars anywhere in the background of any photo.</p>

<p>The Shining</p>

<p>Same computers on board as a 2008 cell phone.</p>

<p>Everyone made it back. If someone got stuck there, that would be more believable.</p>

<p>Propaganda, Uganda, you cannot travel or landa on the moon without proper protection from the radiation.  Or we most certainly would have been back by now. </p>

<p>Vietnam war and national defense vs. space race hmmm.. Just propaganda to make it sound like the US was technologically superior to the USSR.</p>

<p>The USSR, at least until Glasnost was owned by the Jews, you know the ones that did the Russian Czar in, and changed their names to Russian sounding ones and killed millions of Russian. </p>

<p>Their buds were in charge in the US (shadow cabal), so they really weren&#39;t competing, they were dividing and conquering us. </p>

<p>USA / USSR = Rep/Dem - fake division by the same group.</p>

<p>I could go on for hours. It&#39;s just a big lie, and because you believed it so easily, it&#39;s hard for you to admit anything else is plausible.  It&#39;s basic psychology, and it&#39;s ok to admit to yourself you were duped.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice tactic.</p>

<p>In this day in age, telling the truth is not that revolutionary, because very few will believe you, or your message will get spun around in another direction with a twist in the narrative.  Telling the truth does nothing unless you an tell it often enough to make people believe it, and that BTW is probably the key.  Remember the phrase &quot;tell a lie often enough and people will believe it&quot;?  Well, telling the truth only once does nothing.  Even Edward Snowden and Glenn Greenwald figured that out, and this is why they are releasing the data over time, to get as much exposure as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the first things I tell strangers when I meet them is that 911 was an inside job and <em>that I dont believe we walked on the moon anymore</em></p>

<p>Assuming he doesn&#39;t just tell that to people to lure them out of their comfort zone and to start a discussion. </p>

<p>Sorry, I&#39;m new to this sub and new to many of these alternative theories and I would like to be educated (because I also believe not everything is what it seems, but I don&#39;t know what and who to believe anymore and who not...)</p>
