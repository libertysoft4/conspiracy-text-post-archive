    <div class="md"><p>so, to the average american. in the past few months they have learned that</p>

<p>yes, the CIA has tortured (no shit)</p>

<p>yes, there is at least one &#39;black site&#39; on american soil . (constitutional rights?) </p>

<p>yes, the NSA spies on you</p>

<p>now,</p>

<p>The second is not completely obvious, i had never really thought of that. but, this is what the american masses know about their government. </p>

<p>is it for fear? are they telling us this on purpose?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what good is a police state, if the people don&#39;t know they live in one?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same reason Wal-Mart will have fake cameras in its stores... because people change their behavior when being watched.</p>

<p>Now, consider Snowden is neither hero nor villain, rather, he&#39;s a CIA plant to scare americans, to let them know they&#39;re being watched and their rights are being violated right in front of their eyes. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t attach immediate hero status without considering the possibility. After all, he did say in 2009 that leakers should be shot in the balls. <em>in the balls, shot</em>. that is a <strong>fact</strong></p>

<p>We have never seen his full service record. The Guardian initially asked but, never got it.</p>

<p>He can just survive in Hong Kong without being caught? like theres no cia assets there?</p>

<p>This could be the ultimate conspiracy, the ultimate mechanism of the american police state.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;have a fake hero for the people that tells them they are being spied on, and they are conditioned to accept it&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if you don&#39;t think this is the case, you surely must accept <strong>that they have the capability to pull something like this off</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll start off by saying that no I don&#39;t agree with your conclusion, but yes I absolutely agree they/intel services are capable. </p>

<p>There are number of things about Snowden that as an old skool cyberpunk I recognise -- but again, yes, could be dupe, I just don&#39;t see enough evidence to  say he is a plant and, for me at least, enough to think that really could be just a bright guy who got worn down by what he was  being asked to do and eventually took matters in his own hands. Either way if they had a been an anynomous online darknet data-dump it would have done just as much as all the others... nothing....</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t see enough evidence to say he is a plant</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;ll never have concrete evidence of this, what do you expect?</p>

<p>However, there are signs.</p>

<p>&lt;6% of his cache has been released. (Sure, its at greenwald/the intercepts discretion to publish)</p>

<p>I think the leakers being shot in the balls comment is huge. he said that in 2009, i wonder if he thinks manning should be shot in the balls?</p>

<p>Interestingly the first snowden story was published right during Manning&#39;s sentencing trial. </p>

<p>They tried to do a &#39;good vs bad whistle-blower&#39;</p>

<p>Manning was bad = Gave it all online</p>

<p>SNowden was good= gave to journalists. (CIA has no influence over american <em>and</em> foreign media, right?/s)</p>

<p>But-</p>

<p>Either way, TPTB want you to know who snowden is, regardless if snowden is a psy op.</p>

<p>TPTB controls the MSM, the MSM has given him much attention. far more than whistle-blowers of the past</p>

<p>he got on the cover of time, nyt, wapo, they flew brian williams to russia to interview him and <strong>AIR</strong> it on <strong>PRIMETIME</strong> NBC for 40 minutes.</p>

<p>TLDR- the biggest sign snowden isn&#39;t what we think he is , is that the Corporate Media gave attention to him. </p>

<p>response? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;m with you dude, I&#39;ve canvassed all of that, the flip-side - ok for now I&#39;m going to discount the &quot;shot in the balls&quot; things because no offense you should see some of sh#t I&#39;ve written right here on my reddit logs, so.... - is that he was astute enough to sniff out, and he did sniff them out via chains of users with public encrypted keys and known as &quot;safe&quot; in the underground/cyberpunk community, the couple of journalists in the mainstream media who would actually push it properly. It worked, and when it did the rest of the media could ignore it.</p>

<p>Counter?  Either believe me I don&#39;t think Snowden was a &quot;hero&quot; because he was working for them in the first place. I do think he&#39;s someone who did the right, by his conscience, thing, and that in my books is commendable just the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>obviously he did the &#39;right&#39; thing in exposing gov&#39;t wrongdoing. but, thats not the issue. the issue is</p>

<p>1) was he a CIA plant the wholetime</p>

<p>2) if yes or no, why has the MSM given him so much attention?</p>

<p>answer- because tptb &#39;make&#39; them. </p>

<p>tldr- tptb want us to know about snowden, why? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good question. As far as I know it&#39;s still classified. There have been numerous allegations over the years, since MKULTRA was first brought to light, of the existence of an ongoing and particularly nefarious MKULTRA subproject: Project Monarch.</p>
