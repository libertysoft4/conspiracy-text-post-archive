<p>So in light of years and years of systemic mod abuse, the recent relevations from the #ModTalkLeaks (now censored entirely across reddit), and what we believe to be a catastrophic community management failure with little to no accountability being exercised in relation to this, we invite our community here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> or as we&#39;re known in the invite-only moderation clique &#39;conspiratards&#39; , to come forward and submit your negative moderator interactions!</p>

<p>Your submissions will go towards a Press Release to thousands of major journalism publications, and help paint a detailed picture on how to both destroy your community based website, and alienate your userbase.</p>

<p>We aim for this to become a go-to, referenced document on the type of things to avoid when building a revenue generating website that is based around community.</p>

<p>Your participation is encouraged. </p>

<p>We believe you are tired of being talked down to and manipulated.</p>

<p>Are you sick of the lack of accountability that has seemingly ruined this website?</p>

<p>Are you sick of the lack of transparency?</p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t we allowed into <a href="/r/modtalk">/r/modtalk</a> to see what goes on behind the scenes?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KiAChatroom/comments/2yt4xd/android_sub_just_had_a_major_mod_crisis_mods/">Sick of mods not taking their jobs seriously and refusing to conduct themselves professionally, or take responsibility as in this recent example from /r/android?</a></p>

<p>Post your exchanges with moderators, and together we can shed light on the excessive problems, and garner enough community support to fix them. </p>

<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>Respectfully,</p>

<p>RoboBama</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit, I&#39;m on Reddit like every day, OK - I try to stay away from KIA and that sort of shit because whatever those people are up to its not my thing, but this shit is fucking over the top... This is total madness - this is like the only thing needed to show any of those &quot;social justice warriors&quot; or whatever, to make them really consider what is going on and maybe direct their &quot;energy&quot; in the right direction.</p>

<p>(edit) what I mean&#39;t to say at the top with being on Reddit every day is I never say this shit, every, but ofc I don&#39;t frequent the KIA subreddit because it&#39;s so full of shit - on the other hand I do r/all pretty much exclusively, which means is get the KIA buffet in my fucking face daily even though its a pretty obscure thing outside of the gaming &quot;weirdo&quot; community (a disclamer here: I&#39;ve been playing games since I was six years old, starting with C64 and moving on up through ATARI, PC, all kinds of consoles, and more PC obviously), not saying playing PC or any other type of media is weird but these motherfuckers caring about this shit is just SUPER WEIRD - and it keeps getting weirder... now its totally about men and women, no games anymore... whatever I cant follow that shit - all i know is someone is getting shafted bigtime because pseudo-famous people want to be more famous and push buttons they don&#39;t even know what they mean to push a ridiculous made-up agenda that shouldn&#39;t even exist if it wasn&#39;t for some money-hungry bitches that want to be more famous and make more money.</p>

<p>Fuck all of you motherfuckers that keep this ridiculous shit going. It&#39;s disgusting, its revolting, it makes me want to puke. Anyone who cannot see beyond what these fake-ass bitches are doing is unfortunately down and out, not even for the count. Sorry to say. I&#39;ve never commented on this ridiculous shit before but I will now and I just can&#39;t seem to stop writing even though I&#39;m telling myself - dude - you&#39;ve written enough now :) I&#39;m so bloody pissed off by now that shit fucking shit has to stop; you motherfuckers need to start thinking for yourselves and stop listening to morons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had my main/only account shadowbanned about 2 months ago for &quot;posting personal information&quot; (the phone number of an Auto Detailer...a business whose number was in the yellow pages and on their website).</p>

<p>My account <a href="/u/gekokujo">/u/gekokujo</a> had over 40k karma, over a year of gold (with months remaining), about 10 gift exchange badges from Reddit gifts and was over 3 years old.  I had no history of trolling and received no warning before my shadowbanning or note from a Mod/Admin when they did it.   I just had to figure out that it happened and guess why it happened/where it happened.  </p>

<p>I contacted the Admins and politely asked what the problem was.  An Admin who appears in the first leaks asked me &quot;Why do you think it is OK to post personal information?&quot;  I explained that it was the number to a business...definitely not &quot;private information&quot; or &quot;doxxing&quot;.</p>

<p>I never heard back from her...none of my messages to Mods/Admins were returned (even the people who run Gold).  To this day, that one snarky Admin was the only correspondence I have had with Reddit.</p>

<p>I would LOVE for Reddit to look through my old banned account and show me where I was trolling/doxxing at any point.  In doing so, they would see that I was banned for something I probably said at a different time/on a different subreddit, and judging by the Admin that took me down and her involvement in the ModLeaksMemo, it was likely for SJW reasons.  </p>

<p>The fact is....there is no representation within Reddit.  Their TOTAL lack of accountability on this subject is telling.  Has their been any official statement or action based on this?</p>

<p>Good luck to you guys,</p>

If they don&#39;t want their username associated with it, they shouldn&#39;t have done it.  If their username points to the actual person, that is their own fault.

    <div class="md"><p>Would not be surprised if I get banned for posting this. Will refrain from posting proper name links to keep them from noticing this for a while. </p>

<p>I knew Dacvak years ago. We talked on a gaming forum and over AIM for years, but over time I lost contact with him. Dacvak is an administrator, as in, part of the force that runs this site. A man in position of power to do something about the state of Reddit. </p>

<p>Well, I finally noticed that he was an admin at Reddit last year, and I PMed him asking him &quot;Hey, are you the same Dacvak?&quot; and he said yes, and that he remembered me. So I started talking to him over Steam, and after a month or so, I started bringing up issues to him about the state of Reddit. </p>

<p>His claim was that he had absolutely no idea of any sort of wrongdoings in the Reddit admin or mod teams. He said that he had cancer and was in treatment and seldom worked, which is understandable. So I asked him that, if he didn&#39;t have any clue what was going on, then when he was able to, could he look into some of my claims of corruption? He said sure, but he didn&#39;t think he would turn anything up. </p>

<p>A few weeks went by, and I brought the issues up to him again. He said he didn&#39;t know anything and he thought that the very idea of there being corruption in the mods/admins was insane. He told me to write a message to the admins (via the main Reddit username) since he was still on medical leave and explain to them what I thought was going on. So I did. I wrote a long message to the admins, knowing that it would probably be ignored anyway, addressing some common complaints (like BipolarBear0 for example) and hoping to at least get some sort of response. </p>

<p>A couple days later, I found that every last one of my accounts was shadowbanned, except for the ones I hadn&#39;t logged into in months, like old throwaway accounts. Not to mention I got no response to my message from the admins. I tried to message them asking why I was shadowbanned, but I never got any response. </p>

<p>So I brought it up to Dacvak over Steam. I asked him if he could unban me and explain to me what the hell happened. He said he was still on medical leave (while also posting occasionally on Reddit, mind you) and he wasn&#39;t able to do anything. I was willing to try to trust him (though I didn&#39;t really, since I knew from the start that Reddit admins were rotten), and that he really didn&#39;t know anything. I mean, maybe he was out of the loop due to the medical issues? It was certainly possible. Couldn&#39;t fault him for that. </p>

<p>But then all of my bad suspicions about Dacvak were proven right, when the GamerGate scandal happened. </p>

<p>The first thing that got people angry was that there was evidence of corruption in gaming journalism, and the second thing that got people angry was that it was being censored all over the internet. A thread in Gaming was nuked of over 25,000 comments, a sub which Dacvak moderates (and don&#39;t forget, he&#39;s also an admin). </p>

<p>Dacvak supposedly was not the one that actually did the deletions, but he did post a sticky telling everyone to stop talking about it because it was &quot;harassment&quot;. The guy supposedly on medical leave, who knew nothing about any corruption in Reddit and had no power or position to do anything at the moment, posted the sticky post telling everyone to shut up about a growing scandal. </p>

<p>Since then, we have found that our concerns about GamerGate are 100% true and that the corruption and collusion in the gaming journalism industry runs truly deep. Add to that everything that we know about Reddit censoring topics it doesn&#39;t like, and the SRS, Conspiratard and SRD crowds running Reddit from behind the scenes, and it does not paint a pretty picture for Dacvak. </p>

<p>So, after he had posted the sticky, I said to Dacvak &quot;Dude, what the hell?&quot; and claimed that he was directly involved in this coverup. When I brought up him posting the sticky, or the obvious censorship going on, he replied with things like &quot;Wow, you&#39;re insane.&quot; or &quot;There&#39;s no censorship going on and anyone who thinks so must be crazy.&quot; or &quot;Wow, how could you accuse me of something like that? I have cancer, man!&quot; </p>

<p>Obviously, this is complete bullshit, and I told him as much. He quickly blocked me. </p>

<p>So what I&#39;m saying here is that a Reddit Administrator, namely Dacvak, is 100% definitely in some way involved in all of this. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s got cancer and he&#39;s suffering and that really is terrible, but he is using that as his excuse to be free of criticism. To cover up undesirable things by claiming that he knows nothing when he so obviously does. </p>

<p>I won&#39;t say he&#39;s the core of the problem. But I will say that he is definitely knowledgeable and complacent in the events that have transpired on Reddit over the past several months. </p>

<p>So yeah, someone archive this post because I can bet once the admins find out about it, I&#39;ll be shadowbanned. </p>

<p>Funny, that&#39;s the exact canard conspiritard uses in this sub whenever they think a user has had too much to think. Calling everyone they don&#39;t agree with &#39;crazy&#39; and inferring heavily that they are in need of <del>re-education</del> medical attention.</p>

<p>The infamous <strong>BipolarBear0</strong> had been on the prowl, disapproved of a comment I made in a <strong>sub that he did not mod</strong>, and (pretending he didn&#39;t understand the common idiom <em>&quot;the squeaky wheel gets the grease&quot;</em>) summarily BANNED me from EVERY sub that the then moderated - some 70 subs at the time, including <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll come back and post my story when on PC. Essentially another user that has been acting like the mafia for custom content generation in <a href="/r/dota2">/r/dota2</a>, managed to convince site admins to shadowban 5 or so (including me) of the top content generators he was in rivalry with via fake irc logs.</p>

<p>The sub mods were never involved and even tried appealing the decision. A site admin said he received irc logs... And the 5 of us received no further response from site admins since.</p>

<p>I lost 8months of gold and 10 gold credits.</p>

<p>Will update this with screenshots later.</p>

<hr/>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Screenshots as promised. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/lT2M1">http://imgur.com/a/lT2M1</a></p>

<p>Further context, as I could not write as easily on my ipad, when I first posted this.</p>

<p>I originally reached out to the site admins when this happened. Their response indicated that they received IRC logs, which could have only have been manipulated. The IRC channel they are most likely to have been taken/forged of would be the channel custom content generators hang out in to discuss techniques and tools of the craft.</p>

<p>My intent to get this over and done with, and I figured that it would be quicker to simply beg forgiveness than fight from such a poor position. It would be hard to fight unknown allegations, and in the end it would turn into a he-said-she-said battle.</p>

<p>After reaching out to the site admins, we managed to get in contact with a moderator of the sub, and they confirmed that no mod had taken action, and this was likely handed down from admins. We managed to have a chat via skype, and they promised to try and help by asking for clarification from the admins too. As you can imagine, a sub based on original content is going to eventually feel the pressure if their original content generators start getting shadow banned. I will not post the skype logs, as it may be considered a form of doxing, and I do not have permission to share them from the sub moderator, at the time of writing.</p>

<p>The main take away from the conversation with the mod, was that shadowbans are pretty routine, and usually over turned quick smart. This was apparently an exceptional case, as the admins will usually give you a warning on your first infraction.</p>

<p>It was really frustrating that this case was dealt with in such opaqueness, and how the five or so of us never stood a chance to fight our case. It&#39;s pretty hard to demonstrate that you did not do something, and I don&#39;t see why a community collaborating on a project should get punished for liking the content that they produce (although we could abide by it if we were given warning not to look at the stuff we posted). It was even more puzzling, considering this was the first or among very few times, that I had even voted on a post by a fellow modder.</p>

<p>The timing was strange too, considering I had just launched a new service for the Dota2 community, just days previous. The 5th person shadowbanned with us was most likely not related to our community at all. His most recent activity before getting banned, was taking a gif from the self-text post I made during the project launch, and posting it separately to the dota2 sub and getting a thousand or so up-votes (karma whoring). We had never heard of him previous to that. I almost felt sorry for him... but I am not naive enough to assume correlation = causation. I have no other way of contacting him, so I could never ascertain this.</p>

<p>The last picture was my last attempt to try and get fair arbitration on this case. The admin never responded, so I can only assume that this trial was over.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Android sub just had a major mod crisis, mods tried to sweep it under the rug, users went berserk. Damage control currently engaged.</h3>

<p>TL;DR</p>

<p>1. A valuable community member who runs an Android news site had his flair changed from his web site to lemon party (NSFL!!) by a moderator.</p>

<p>2. The user panicked upon realizing this, reset their flair, believed reddit or their PC was hacked, and began changing all their passwords.</p>

<p>3. The moderator then changed their flair to meat spin (NSFL!!!)</p>

<p>4. Another moderator (apparently) noticed the users flair was an innappropriate site and banned the user.</p>

<p>5. All of this came to light to the user and the community, the mods solutions were this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Make the mod apologize but not remove them as a mod.</p></li>
<li><p>Ban users from setting their own flair (!?!?!)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>6. Users went berserk calling for the abusive moderator to be removed.</p>

<p>7. The mods eventually held a private &quot;vote&quot; on this and agreed to remove the mod.</p>

<p>8. They are now going to great lengths to hide the name of the abusive moderator, claiming: <strong>just because he changed a user&#39;s flair to meatspin (NSFL!) and lemonparty (NSFL!) doesn&#39;t mean they wouldn&#39;t be a good moderator of other subs, because other subs have different rules.</strong></p>

<p>This was messaged to me as evidence who the abusive mod was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe it was u/Paradox who made that prank and got kicked out.</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.today/BUXbi">https://archive.today/BUXbi</a></p>

<p>If you look at the archive page of r/android mod list a month ago and compare it to the current one, there are two people who were removed</p>

<p>u/Xert, which seems to be inactive for 4 months</p>

<p>u/Paradox, which is active, never commented on this whole drama, and still moderate Android questions.</p>

You expect an anonymous person on the internet to moderate forums for you, for no reason other than &quot;someone has to do it&quot;, and do it to your liking.  Then, if this individual makes a joke which you deem not funny, you expect serious repercussions?  You expect me to give a shit about some &quot;conspiracy&quot; ?  A conspiracy about a mod online who gave a user some inappropriate flare and got him banned for it?  This is important to you?  holy fuck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the case of <a href="/r/PoliticalModeration">/r/PoliticalModeration</a> I founded the subreddit and handed it off to cojoco after the mods of <a href="/r/politcs">/r/politcs</a> used my involvement in the subreddit as an excuse to suppress it.</p>

<p>I picked cojoco because he seemed to take a reasonable view of moderation and share my concerns about transparency.  This was a couple years ago, undelete wasn&#39;t even a thing IIRC.</p>

<p>I really try to avoid interpersonal drama on reddit as much as possible so I really don&#39;t want to take sides here.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say that I&#39;ve not personally had any bad interactions with cojoco; but that I agree that his decision to ban you from <a href="/r/snowden">/r/snowden</a> seems questionable even following his own explanation.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t like the (overall reddit) trend of banning people for their mostly unrelated behavior in external subs.  But this is just my personal opinion.</p>

<p>Note that <a href="/r/PoliticalModeration">/r/PoliticalModeration</a> gets monitored for removals by my bot.  If he removes anything there it will be reported to <a href="/r/ModerationLog">/r/ModerationLog</a> or <a href="/r/RemovedComments">/r/RemovedComments</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made the subreddit <a href="/r/deletenothing">/r/deletenothing</a> after <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> was compromised by an new moderator that was known to be possibly corrupt.  I made it as a backup, or a replacement to <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a>.</p>

<p>I was relentlessly stalked by several moderators after doing this, namely u/fritzly, u/unclesamuel, u/emr1028, u/75000_Tokkul, and u/eberkneezer . If you go to their pages, you&#39;ll notice they each moderate between 5 and 500 subreddits. </p>

<p>For evidence, go to the subreddit and just look at what they did to me. One of them even went so far as <a href="https://www.change.org/p/tony-blair-and-reddit-and-r-trees-remove-u-magnora2-from-reddit">to create a petition against me on change.org</a>.</p>

<p>The stalking was persistent and lasted for weeks. Anytime I posted anything political in any subreddit, even just comments, they could come in and try to make me look bad and diminish my opinion. This went on until one day my account was eventually shadowbanned because I called someone a JIDF shill  in <a href="/r/AdviceAnimals">/r/AdviceAnimals</a> (because they were blindly defending Israel during the time Israel was bombing Palestine). The moderator said that I was making personal accusations, apparently passed this on to an administrator and I was shadowbanned.</p>

<p>Just a few hours after, <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> had a new mod, u/75000_Tokkul, one of the people involved in stocking me. How about that. </p>

<p>I have plenty of more information if anyone is interested. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>1</em></strong>) It is by now a &quot;public secret&quot; that if you post negatively about certain topics, especially the NSA or Reddit censorship, the moderators will removed or moved it to an obscure sub-Reddit. Sometimes the Moderators will simply delete or manipulate votes or allow &quot;professional PR Firms&quot; to down vote and trolls you comments and posts. No need to pretend otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>2)</em></strong> I have seen it done to other people and myself 100&#39;s of times. Constructive criticism died a long long time ago on Reddit. No need to pretend otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>3)</em></strong> Reddit is a privately owned firm. They employ people. We call those people Reddit Moderators. The Moderators do what they are told to do. It works exactly like any other branches of the corporate owned media. No need to pretend otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>4)</em></strong> We know that every single year the USA government spend at least $ 80 billion to keep the NSA running. We have no way to discover how much the private industry is involved. We know that the NSA employs 1000&#39;s of people who´s only job it is to influence the public debate and consensus. The Reddit Moderators are a part of that. No need to pretend otherwise.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All the time, we see posts critical of Reddit censorship are getting removed or people having their accounts shadow banned. The Intelligence Community and their allies has a firm grip on the mass media. No Need to pretend otherwise.</p>

<p>There is nothing you can do to stop the brigade and remove the cancer without killing the host.</p>

<p>Cancers can be banned, but they get a new IP via VPN or proxy. To get rid of the hiveminded subs, you would have to limit the subscriber base. That would only create gated community subs and further the clique. You could eradicate all moderation, but then what? Nothing but dick pics in the TwoXChromosomes like subs and shit like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a suggestion to put forward. I think we should start a new site and move everyone over to it using a system i came up with from the help of other people on reddit.
Its a reputation system the people have to build before they can be seen as active and participatory members of the site.</p>

<p>The idea is called P.A.S.T (Participatory, Accountable, Skillful and Trustworthy)
What happens is when a user creates an account, his actions on the site are rated by the entire community who each have their own P.A.S.T. A score is given for each action based on the severity of it. I want to use it for a real world society accountability program, but we could easily use this for a new social networking site? what do you guys think?</p>

<p>Maybe make a new sub and get people in who want to start a  new site?

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, it is very easy. I have seen so much manipulation here that I am desensitized about it. When a community like reddit gets too much traction and ideas are flowing freely around and spread across the internet there are interests to manipulate that community. It all depends on the how big the community is but sooner or later the professional manipulators and disinfo agents will divide and conquer. Money and social engineering is also often involved to gain control and install their admins. That all happened here and there is no quick solution to help it anymore. There will be as usual a massive exodus soon and this community will not be known any longer as it was intended by Aaron. Similar transitions happened followed by an exodus with several forums that I was in, with youtube, with digg, with 4chan and it will inevitable happen with reddit. So if you ask me I tell you I do not care any longer. You can fight all you want, but this is not my fight. De mortuis nil nisi bene. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The state of censors is .... Censorship.</p>

<p>Surprise surprise.</p>

<p>The minute reddit brought in censors ...errr ... moderators it ceased to be community driven .</p>

<p>You cant have ok censorship. You are either censore dor you can talk freely.</p>

<p>Once you enter the debate about which censorship is &quot;correct&quot; then you become part of the censorship problem.</p>

<p>There was never spam on reddit. Blatantly commercial appeals were handled well by the voting system. Spam was the excuse they used to bring in censorship.</p>

<p>Reddit is a censored arm of Advanced Publications owned and completely controlled by the 7 th largsst mainstream media families in the world whp also owns conde naste and other mainstream media.</p>

<p>It was sold by its open minded founders for a rumored $20 million dollars years ago. You cant blame the kids who started it . And maybe they were told they would have some control etc but it doesnt matter.
Reddit is now a heavily censored story discussion board and not a communoty driven story board driven by upvotes and downvotes. Any mainstream media source that says that is either intentionally lying or frankly so stupid and ignorant that they shouldnt be writing about Reddit </p>

<p>We used to influence presidential elections and national issues on reddit. Now we simply come to loook in vain for some original wisdom and cooperation while we wait for a better platform to emerge.</p>

Are you implying that redditors outside of USA are unimportant, or not relevant? Please explain....</p>

<hr/>

<p><del><em>Still awaiting a reply....</em></del></p>

<h3>UPDATE:</h3>

<p>Four hours later I receive this reply received from <a href="/u/DonTago">/u/DonTago</a>:  </p>

<p>Hi Yehi,<br/>
Firstly, news about the drama and goings-on within Reddit (meta-news) that does not specifically relate to world news events is something that is not appropriate for the worldnews sub. Being that the incident itself with Pao and Fletcher is a wholly US internal news, so too is the submission, which would make it more appropriate for US news or tech sub. This removal does not signify any sort of value judgement on non-US Redditors... it is instead a statement of our focus on significant international issues, as opposed to issues about US news and Reddit drama. Let me know if you have more questions.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>My reply to DonTago:</strong></p>

<p>Firstly, thank you for your reply.
Please know that I hear what you&#39;re saying. I also understand and I agree that metajunk has no place in <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>. However, the issue I&#39;m referring to (and which the article discusses) has little to do with Pao/Fletcher&#39;s problems and it goes far beyond reddit meta.</p>

<p>Fact: respected news sites from around the world are reporting this story as if it is news</p>

<p>Besides the article which I submitted, other professional journalists agree that this is a news story and articles are now appearing in the New York Post, the Daily Telegraph, the Guardian, Wired Magazine, to mention but a few. These are all respected news sites run by professional journalists who see it as news.</p>

<p>Fact: you are suggesting that it is not news, or not &#39;world&#39; news anyway.</p>

<p>When you add all of these articles (above) to the fact that the issue being discussed has the potential to affect all reddit users from around the world, that makes it &#39;world&#39; news. It cannot be otherwise.</p>

<p>Fact: reddit touts itself as &quot;the front page of the Internet&quot;</p>

<p>As I said above, the article I posted has little to do with Pao/Fletcher&#39;s legal problems as such but rather, discusses a side issue which is very significant to redditors worldwide. As such, unless I can convince you to allow the post(s) then I trust you will accept that, as an avid redditor, I will lobby fervently against what I see as censorship.</p>

<p>Obviously, I am not the only person who thinks of this as censorship - threads are alive all over reddit at the moment as a result. In particular, I encourage you to take a gander at this discussion over at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> which began a week before the article was published. I, for one, would value your input in this discsussion and I encourage you to take part. Your input on these matters would surely be appreciated.</p>

<p>Finally, as an avid redditor, I hope you will see my point of view, and that of countless professional journalists, and I pray you will help to subside this issue before it escalates further by allowing these submissions to be posted. Then you could allow redditors to decide for themselves whether it is <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> material or not. (As reddit never ceases to amaze me, you may be pleasantly surprised.)</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<hr/>

<h3><del>FINAL</del> UPDATE:</h3>

<p><del>The mods over at <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> have subsequently reconsidered their position and <a href="http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/users-lash-out-at-reddit-boss-for-deleting-posts-on-hubbys-lawsuit/story-fn5tas5k-1227271600106">the article has been successfully submitted</a></del></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, that is very accurately explained by an admin in that very post. Most people who know anything about the spam filter will know about this, as well. If you edit a text-submission <strong>or</strong> a comment and include any link to a generic link shortener (bit.ly for example), the spam-filter automatically flags it as spam.

    <div class="md"><p>IMHO you should be for something as opposed to against something IE be the change you hope to see. Create your own subs,  hold yourself to a higher standard. Lets face it, negative based people thrive on internal drama as it serves as a validation to their outlook. Ignore them, forcing change isnt really change its just more drama and negativity. Offer other choices do the footwork and reap the benefit and comradary of like minded individuals. Being informed and aware is one thing, playing into it is another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find the whole underlying culture slightly odd.  Doesn&#39;t Reddit have any kind of rules regarding concerns by reddit users?  I was a frequent user of another sub reddit, there seemed to be a problem with a subscriber that had been going on longer than I joined.  There was an issue where said subscriber actually talked about finding people (which is weird granted) but the way the mods responded and people revelled in it all disturbed me and I subsequently unsubscribed.  </p>

<p>Instead of naming and shaming and labelling said person as mentally ill to 2000 subscribers I feel it could have been handled better.  All that really needed to be said was we are taking this issue seriously, we&#39;ve taken it to Reddit and if anyone has concerns to message mods immediately.  If there is no process for this then I think there should be and reddit needs to protect mods and service users in a more professional way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the last couple of days, I&#39;ve been watching and waiting for someone to suggest this. My thought:</p>

<p>The current reddit-wide moderation backlash is by design. A psyop, if you will. At this point in the game, the last thing reddit&#39;s owners want is a group of independent moderators. This site is a business, and reddit&#39;s model of decentralized editorial control has to be destroyed in order for it to be a viable candidate for an IPO (for example). The inherent risk of being associated with controversy has, I would imagine, scared off many investors up to this point. In order for reddit to be maximally profitable, editorial control needs to be removed from individual subreddits and their independent moderators. Here&#39;s how I see this playing out:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Reddit hires a moderation team to &#39;assist and support&#39; current moderators.</p></li>
<li><p>Existing moderators are gradually relieved of their positions, resulting in much smaller moderation teams (2-3 mods/sub).</p></li>
<li><p>Reddit adopts official content guidelines and moderation protocols.</p></li>
<li><p>The moderation &#39;assist and support&#39; team is absorbed by the admin team and become official site-wide moderators. Existing mods who are willing to get with the program are hired by reddit, mods who aren&#39;t are purged.</p></li>
<li><p>Reddit begins removing subreddits that don&#39;t meet their guidelines. Nice to know ya, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>!</p></li>
<li><p>Reddit removes the ability of any person to create a subreddit. Any new subreddit will have to be approved by the moderation team, and modded by a person of reddit&#39;s choosing.</p></li>
<li><p>The owners of reddit now have complete editorial control.</p></li>
<li><p>Profit.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The current controversy is the key. If the admins just start cracking down and trying to seize control, people will leave in droves. However, if users are begging the site to fix the moderation problem...</p>

<p>Problem, reaction, solution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have so little knowledge  of reddit and where the power rests that I wouldn&#39;t dare offer.  </p>

<p>An my only real interest in reddit is distracting  and entertaining myself in r politics and occasionally in r conspiracy and r technology.</p>

<p>I do see a lot of censoring in all and any sub related to a politicized issue that I have so far visited.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The saddest part for me is that it never used to be like this. And the moderators were awesome, and they took their little mini job seriously. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, modding now is like a full time job. Reddit should really pay these guys. They don&#39;t conduct themselves in a professional manner. Or responsibly. And now its going to reflect poorly on the site.</p>

<p>Someone has to hold them accountable, and it might as well be the community itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you.</p>

<p>However, these issues should be well documented, for reasons i&#39;ve stated in this thread but will say again: to make sure these mistakes aren&#39;t made again by another site with incredible promise.</p>

<p>How to temper growth to avoid becoming cancerous is just one issue. How to treat your communities with respect. etc </p>

<p>Oh yes they are paid. Just not in dollars by Reddit or its corporate owner.</p>

<p>Seems like you&#39;re saying &#39;oh no, they aren&#39;t paid. What I mean is that they could potentially exploit their position for financial gain&#39;, which is an entirely different thing.</p>

<p>Which moderators—or which subreddits— do you think engage in this activity?</p>
