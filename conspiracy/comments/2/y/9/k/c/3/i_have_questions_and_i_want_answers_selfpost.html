<p>And was interested in what all of you had to say about them.</p>

<p>I am going to give my take on all of them, and then I&#39;d like to hear all yours.</p>

<p><em><sup>Spoiler Alert and Trigger Warning: I am going to take an &quot;Exopolitical&quot; point of view.</sup></em></p>

<p>Most of these I have never really heard of, and have not researched yet. So I am just guessing about this, based on what this unimpressive author has to say about it. Once I do some research, after writing this, I may come back to edit it with updated info, as I am sure the author is clueless.</p>

<h3>#5. We Don&#39;t Know What the Ancient Egyptians Actually Looked Like</h3>

<p>As the author explains, we have no accurate images of the Pre-Persian Egyptians. The author claims that the greeks said they had dark curly hair. But didn&#39;t indicate their race. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure about this. But this could be the slaves of the Annunaki. It is said that extremely lazy ExtraTerrestrials (I believe them to be reptilians) came here from planet Nibiru (Or Hibiru if you&#39;re paying attention), and created a hybrid race of slaves to mine for things like gold, crystals, precious metals and gems, as well as build the pyramids. </p>

<p>Those whose genetic material came from the Royal Family of the reptilian Annunaki were said to have later become the 12 tribes of Israel. But we&#39;re not talking about them, necessarily. I believe the slaves are said to have been created from avg citizens of Hibiru, not the royal bloodlines.</p>

<p>These are said to have been Red/Brown ruddy people with black curly hair. </p>

<p>This is going back to when <strong>El</strong> was in charge. (Keep in mind, <strong>Is</strong>is <strong>Ra</strong> and <strong>El</strong>)</p>

<p>The original people were the creation of El, believe, but his son Enki was known for doing a lot of genetic manipulation. </p>

<p>And since the Pyramids were likely built something like 30,000 years ago or more, it may have been Enki&#39;s creations that were there before the Persians came in.</p>

<h3>#4. There Are Giant Stone Heads in Central America, and We Have No Idea How They Got There</h3>

<p>I have a couple theories about how all the giant ancient monoliths may have been moved.</p>

<p>Since there is no known language back when these things were moved, I believe that everyone was telepathic in those days. I only believe that language came label as a way to hinder honest communication.</p>

<p>I also believe that people were telekenetic. I believe that a large enough group of people could have moved 1000 Ton blocks with their minds.</p>

<p>I also believe that teleportation could easily explain it. I have no doubt that E.T.s had that technology back then, as it is basically the same technology that allows for Space-Time Travel. </p>

<p>I also would be willing to believe that the Arc of the Covenant could have something to do with it. It is said to be a huge capacitor. I am not sure how, but this could somehow be involved.</p>

<p>Or perhaps it was just some ET anti-gravity technology. Although, I believe they had more efficient means.</p>

<h3>#3. There Is a Huge Network of Mysterious, Man-Made Caves in China</h3>

<p>This is easy. It is a well known fact that almost all the extraterrestrials live underground, or undersea. I believe that this is/was somehow involved with that. The ETs (and native terran reptilians) have always been very secretive about their underground lairs. I believe this is one, or at least an entrance to one.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that they would have a series of shallow caves, with a secret passageway or door that leads to deeper civilizations miles underground.</p>

<h3>#2. We Can&#39;t Read One of History&#39;s Most Important Languages</h3>

<p>Not much to say about this. I do believe that there may have been a translation of this found or made. I believe there is probably occult information involved. </p>

<h3>#1. The &quot;Sea Peoples&quot; Destroyed Virtually Every Major City of the Ancient World ... and We Have No Idea Who They Were</h3>

<p>I have never heard of this before. But before I even got to the end of the article, I was already assuming it was some reptilians.</p>

<p>I will have to look more into this, but since Reptilians are said to believe that their creator created them with the purpose to conquer, I am going to guess that this was some sort of reptilian, or reptilian hybrid race of warriors. </p>

<p>Hopefully you guys know more about this stuff and can enlighten me. I&#39;ll be researching it while I wait for responses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>5: well the Greeks say they were dark skinned (as said in the article) now that probably means that they certainly not black but olive skinned or darker. The frescoes of the egyptians would be made colourful to make them look nice</p>

<p>I have heard of no credible evidence that the pyramids were built 30k years ago, on the other hand reputable Egyptologists have placed them over a fairly long time period a few thousand years BC</p>

<p>4: Language tends to be invented fairly quickly, on the other hand telepathy has no evidence that I have seen</p>

<p>3: link?</p>

<p>2: It is very hard to decipher an extinct language. Linear B, used by the Myceneans was only deciphered relatively recently but Linear A has still not been deciphered. Not some crazy conspiracy. Also the Romans were great engineers so I am doubtful of the claim that they stole everything from the etruscans</p>

<p>I know. Because you have done zero research, and instead just parrot what you hear on TV. No, the pyramids were not built &quot;a few thousand years ago&quot;</p>

<p>The egyptians recorded everything they did. No mention of building a building with a 13 acre base. I think that would have come up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many documentaries and writings on the topic. I do not agree with how <a href="/u/YHWHisSatan">/u/YHWHisSatan</a> is addressing you, but he is right on some things. There are archaeological investigations going on trying to figure out the time span it would take for the Nile to recede from where the pyramids stand to where it is currently. The theory is that the buildings would&#39;ve been built very close to the Nile. Now there is a considerable distance from the Great pyramid to the Nile. How long would it take a river to recede gives you the age of the pyramids, which drastically predate the &quot;main stream&quot; belief of a few thousands years. Look it up, it&#39;s pretty fascinating stuff if your into it.</p>

<p>Ever seen the pictures drawn on their ancient sites? The size of their statues?</p>

<p>Ever wonder <em>why</em> God wiped out those cultures? <em>Why</em> he wiped out the giants?</p>

<p>&quot;<em>Mighty men</em>&quot; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=mighty+men&amp;amp;qs_version=KJV">in the Bible</a> means more than just strong people. Look into the Nephilim.</p>

<li><p>I read about those ppl in school, as I took all the history classes I could. It&#39;s facinating really. There was a group of ppl in the anchient world, that didn&#39;t destory every city, but did raid and pratically rule the mediterrian for some time, and then, for no reasonable explaination, just fall off of history. If atlantis theory has any strong supporting evidence, it&#39;s these &quot;sea ppl&quot; as they were far more advanced than the other civs at the time, and could be the reason that eygpt and babalyon experinced thier culure boom. As both seemed to come outta no where at the top of thier civs, that then degraded, instead of the being built upon and strengthed as time passed, if that makes any sense. </p></li>
<li><p>I haven&#39;t heard about this one, but nothing is untranlatable. And how do they know it&#39;s important if they can&#39;t tell what it says. For all we know it&#39;s a babalyonian-esc equal to a Jedi post o.o </p></li>
<li><p>Man made caves in the same nation that built the great wall and without any proposition of alien aid like everyone gives the egyptians. You don&#39;t say o.o?</p></li>
<li><p>Man carved em&#39;. nephelim placed em as a border message if you will to other nephelim.</p></li>
<li><p>They were tan, like everyone else that bordered the sea. My proof, thier own paintings. if they were a diffrent shade, they&#39;d a used a diffrent shade. not like they didn&#39;t know how to mix colors. e.e</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I beg your pardon. He is the one who made that claim.</p>

<p>But I suspect he is speaking of a more recent people than I am.</p>

<p>There doesn&#39;t seem to be any trace of the people who actually built the pyramids. They didn&#39;t carve anything into it. </p>

<p>So, no, you can&#39;t base anything about the ancient Egyptians on paintings or how they look today. The Egyptians today are not related to the original Egyptians </p>
