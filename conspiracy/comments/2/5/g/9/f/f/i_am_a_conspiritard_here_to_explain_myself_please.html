    <div class="md"><p>with the overwhelming amount of circumstantial evidence linking the CIA to george bush sr to richard nixon to jack ruby and etc., and with the overwhelming amount of suspicious behavior on part of the secret service such as destroying documents and illegally performing the autopsy in DC, do you think JFK was assassinated by a lone gunman, or was it a conspiracy and a coup?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally i was never quite sure, as a child my father handed me a book about his military career, presidency, and assassination . 
I grew to believe in a conspiracy overall, that it would not be easy to pull off the shot that Oswald pulled off - or SHOTS rather - with a bolt action rifle in rapid succession in high accuracy, tight grouping, at that range. 
My mind was changed definitively when i saw a Designated Marksman attempt the same shot with a bolt action rifle and found it nearly impossible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>so if the government has shown the capability to kill its own president, and along with the blatant disregard they have for human life (look to any latin america or middle eastern country over the past 60 years), do you think its possible for the government to allow the death of 3,000 citizens on 9/11 to further the business interests of a few powerful people? it wouldnt be the first time a government has worked against the interest of its own people, and it isnt the last (look at fast and furious, for example)</p>

for two MAJOR reasons. 
1: OPERATION:NORTHWOODS - an attempt at a &quot;false flag operation&quot; to pilot an aircraft and crash it into a structure and blame said tragedy on a foreign force- thereby enabling public support for war. 
2:Gulf Of Tonkin Incident - Defense Secretary Mcnamara ADMITTED that it was all some big &quot;mistaken identity&quot; that caused the conflict - I personally can&#39;t see how they figured that out SEVEN years after the conflict began. </p>

why? 
I saw a subreddit called &quot;conspiritards&quot; that mocks conspiracy theorists, and makes fun of them as foolish, infantile people; in the knowledge that I am a conspiracy theorist and support many theories, I thought i&#39;d share my thoughts in the hope of explaining myself and bridging our subreddits with some sort of humility and understanding. </p>

thats one big reason im called a racist, because i posted a link once about what a jewish man said about us gentiles.
i said &quot;THERE ARE a select few jews who despise gentiles and view them as sub-human, as slaves and/or animals, and those jews are not to be respected, but sought out ans treated like any other worthless racists&quot; </p>
