    <div class="md"><p>FEMA did an analysis of some of the steel from building 7:</p>

<p>A) <a href="http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf">http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf</a></p>

<p>Look at the photos of the sample in that pdf especially the first and second photos.</p>

<p>Then look at the experiment that the guy did in this video @10 minutes 35 seconds.</p>

<p>B) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQu18DHuutU#t=10m34s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQu18DHuutU#t=10m34s</a></p>

<p>The FEMA sample (A) and the steel cut by thermite in the video (B) look almost identical.</p>

<p>The FEMA PHD&#39;s in material science could not figure out what caused the melting in (A). They did not analyse for explosives of accelerants. They asked that there be further study to determine what caused the melting. Take a wild guess if there was further study done.</p>

<p>Also look at the color of the smoke in the video and then look at the color of the smoke that blasts out of the windows ahead of the crashing towers. The color is identical.</p>

<p>Unless aluminum gets to about 4000 F, it&#39;s going to be silvery. Even slag from the smelting process is silvery. </p>

<p>However, steel at about 2500 F turns a nice yellow-orange color, and will act exactly the way the video shows. <a href="http://youtu.be/1L115szWbjg">http://youtu.be/1L115szWbjg</a></p>

<p>Also, a thermite reaction reacts in a very similar manor.</p>

<p><a href="http://i204.photobucket.com/albums/bb181/slimpimpinstb/WTC20Molten20Steel20Photos20Fact-1.jpg">The red hot steel in the picture on the right shows that metal is over 2300°F</a>.  Even if the &quot;aluminum&quot; pouring out of the towers at it&#39;s melting point of 1220.58 °F, it still cannot transfer it&#39;s heat to the other steel objects around it making them hotter.  For example, if you pour a bunch of super hot aluminum( say +1400 °F) on a bunch of steel ibeams and rebar, it is physically impossible for it to warm that steel up to +2300°F.  It&#39;s like putting hot coffee in a thermos, only to find it way hotter 6 hrs later.  </p>

<p>Are you saying this is the same stuff that was seen in the first video? </p>

<p>You notice yourself that it isn&#39;t molten and you can make out rebar.</p>

<p>The reaction between aluminum and iron(III) oxide can generate temperatures approaching 3000 degrees C / 5432 degrees F.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s review the 1st law of thermodynamics:</p>

<p><em>The internal energy of a system can be changed by heating the system or by doing work on it; the first law of thermodynamics states that the increase in internal energy is equal to the total heat added and work done by the surroundings.</em></p>

<p>So in order to achieve ground temperatures of +2800°F, which sustained themselves for +8 weeks, the whole entire system must have had added heat/energy from another source other than office fires and jet fuel.  </p>

<p>When the towers collapsed, <strong>the heat put into the system was greater than +2800°F.</strong></p>

<p>Jet fuel can only reach temperatures of 1800°F.</p>

<p>Some interesting information..</p>

<ul>
<li>1535ºC (2795ºF) - melting point of iron</li>
<li>1510ºC (2750ºF) - melting point of typical structural steel</li>
<li>825ºC (1517ºF) - maximum temperature of hydrocarbon fires burning in the atmosphere without pressurization or pre-heating (premixed fuel and air - blue flame)</li>
</ul>

<p>Diffuse flames burn far cooler.
Oxygen-starved diffuse flames are cooler yet.
The fires in the towers were diffuse -- well below 800ºC.
Their dark smoke showed they were oxygen-starved -- particularly in the South Tower.</p>

<p>Maximum jet fuel burn temperature is 825 Celsius.</p>

<p>Temperature needed to melt structural steel is 1510 Celsius.</p>

<p>Compare this.</p>

<p>On February 13, 1975, the WTC North Tower was beset by a fire, which &quot;burned at temperatures in excess of 700°C (1,292°F) for over three hours and spread over some 65 percent of the 11th floor, including the core, caused no serious structural damage to the steel structure. In particular, no trusses needed to be replaced.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are so many problems here.</p>

<p>First, it is myth that molten steel was found 8 weeks after collapse. <a href="http://planet.infowars.com/science/911-debunking-molten-steel">http://planet.infowars.com/science/911-debunking-molten-steel</a></p>

<p>Second, jet fuel is not the only thing burning, and the heat of the fire cannot be linked to the burning point of jet fuel. <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military/news/debunking-911-myths-world-trade-center">http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military/news/debunking-911-myths-world-trade-center</a></p>

<p>Dark smoke can come from oxygen starved fire. However, that is not the only thing that can cause dark smoke. <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/threads/debunked-black-smoke-and-orange-flames-as-an-indicator-of-an-oxygen-starved-low-temp-fire.2373/">https://www.metabunk.org/threads/debunked-black-smoke-and-orange-flames-as-an-indicator-of-an-oxygen-starved-low-temp-fire.2373/</a></p>

<p>Third, that fire in the 70s was minor compared to the 9/11 fires. Really, there is no comparision.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still doesn&#39;t explain how a system that can only get up to 1800 degrees by jet fuel, can reach temps of greater than 2800 degrees.  Some other energy was added to make it that hot.  Office fires and jet fuel cannot attain these temps.  You can take an abandoned 10 story building and pour 300,000 gallons of fuel on it, it would still never reach 2800 degrees.  Nope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why does it need to be less than aluminum? It just needs to be a melting point that was around the temperature of the explosion/fire.</p>

<p>Copper burns red/yellow when molten and has a relatively low melting point (1080 C). There would be plenty of copper in the building and probably some in the plane. 1080 C is a little over the estimate of the max burning temp of Jet A (~900) but not by much. </p>

<p>Also, the obvious one: Plastics. There would be literal tons of plastics in the plane and building. Plastics melt at very low temps (~75-260 C, well below the fire&#39;s burning temp). Check out this plastic on fire and dripping: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfGOkPAsG8s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfGOkPAsG8s</a>, looks kinda like what we see in the WTC video. </p>

<p>Of course its goddamn molten steel. That is the only material present capable of glowing at that temperature and its the only material present capable of holding in that much heat for a period of well over a month.  Terminator 2!!! YOU MUST BELIEVE!</p>

<p>Exclusive to American Free Press</p>

<p>By Christopher Bollyn</p>

<p>American Free Press has learned of pools of “molten steel” found at the base of the collapsed twin towers weeks after the collapse. Although the energy source for these incredibly hot areas has yet to be explained...</p>

<p>In the basements of the collapsed towers, where the 47 central support columns connected with the bedrock, hot spots of “literally molten steel” were discovered more than a month after the collapse. Such persistent and intense residual heat, 70 feet below the surface, in an oxygen starved environment, could explain how these crucial structural supports failed.</p>

<p>Peter Tully, president of Tully Construction of Flushing, N.Y., told AFP that he saw pools of “literally molten steel” at the World Trade Center.</p>

<p>Tully was contracted after the Sept. 11 tragedy to re move the debris from the site.</p>

<p>Tully called Mark Loizeaux, president of Controlled Demolition, Inc. (CDI) of Phoenix, Md., for consultation about removing the debris. CDI calls itself “the innovator and global leader in the controlled demolition and implosion of structures.”</p>

<p>Loizeaux, who cleaned up the bombed Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, arrived at the WTC site two days later and wrote the clean-up plan for the entire operation.</p>

<p>AFP asked Loizeaux about the report of molten steel on the site.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “hot spots of molten steel in the basements.”</p>

<p>These incredibly hot areas were found “at the bottoms of the elevator shafts of the main towers, down seven [basement] levels,” Loizeaux said.</p>

<p>The molten steel was found “three, four, and five weeks later, when the rubble was being removed,” Loizeaux said. He said molten steel was also found at 7 WTC, which collapsed mysteriously in the late afternoon.</p>

<p>Construction steel has an extremely high melting point of about 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Not &quot;multiple airliners.&quot;</p>

<p>The building was designed to withstand the impact of the largest aircraft at the time - a Boeing 707 - traveling at near-landing speed with limited fuel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You straight up lose on speed issue, sorry…...</p>

<p>A white paper released on February 3, 1964 states that the Towers could have withstood impacts of jetliners travelling 600 mph -- a speed greater than the impact speed of either jetliner used on 9/11/01.</p>

<p>&quot;The buildings have been investigated and found to be safe in an assumed collision with a large jet airliner (Boeing 707—DC 8) traveling at 600 miles per hour. Analysis indicates that such collision would result in only local damage which could not cause collapse or substantial damage to the building and would not endanger the lives and safety of occupants not in the immediate area of impact.&quot; </p>

<p><sup><sup>they</sup></sup> say &quot;jetliners&quot;---plural, although it&#39;s not clear that they&#39;re referring to an actual number it can withstand vs. multiple models of jetliners.</p>

<p>But Demarini, construction manager did say he believed it could withstand multiple----</p>

<p>Frank A. Demartini, on-site construction manager for the World Trade Center, spoke of the resilience of the towers in an interview recorded on January 25, 2001.</p>

<p>&quot;The building was designed to have a fully loaded 707 crash into it. That was the largest plane at the time. I believe that the building probably could sustain multiple impacts of jetliners because this structure is like the mosquito netting on your screen door -- this intense grid -- and the jet plane is just a pencil puncturing that screen netting. It really does nothing to the screen netting&quot;</p>
