<p>This is their reasons why one should take flouride:</p>

<ul>
<li>The dose is so little that is not harmfull to you.</li>
<li>People in the past had worse teeths than we have today (because of no flouride)</li>
<li>Flouride helps clean the water</li>
<li>toothpaste(with flouride) gives you better breath</li>
<li>I have used flouride for a long time, and I&#39;m fine.</li>
<li>If flouride is so bad for you, why is it still used?</li>

<p>So here is how I always frame it: &quot;If people want to use fluoride, than buy fluoride toothpaste, is it really the government&#39;s job or place to forcibly add it to the community water supply? Where does it end, do we start adding other things that some bureaucrats deem to be for the public good? What would the worst government ever elected do with this power, and do you submit that there will be times when bad leaders are elected who may abuse this privileged? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That first one looks at populations in areas with high natural levels of fluoride in water and populations with little or now fluroride in water. Because the contrasting populations are difficult to find in the developed counties, ost of the studies used for this study are from China.</p>

<p>&quot;Conclusions: The results support the possibility of an adverse effect of high fluoride exposure on children’s neurodevelopment. Future research should include detailed individual-level information on prenatal exposure, neurobehavioral performance, and covariates for adjustment.&quot;</p>

<p>Notice the study is about high fluoride exposure. As noted in this thread, dosage is everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Notice it is about two different types of fluoride. One is natural and occurs in ground water and the one we use, sodium fluoride, is an industrial waste product. They are not the same. Our water additive was never meant to be inside the human body and reduces IQ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>at radio4all.net there is a talk by paul connet(?)(im mobile just do search fo flouride) thats very convincing.</p>

<p>after looking at several fl threads its really quite odd the passion many have for the stuff, i suspect shillery but anyway...</p>

<p>ive been off fl for a year and it changed my life, headaches went away and return if i have a glass of tapwater.  it also affects the ease and connection i experience when meditating.  </p>

<p>i dont know what concentrations and what glands are affected, but my experience has been stark, i got my hightst score ever on an iq test about a month ago.  i had a similar increase in mental clarity when i had my mercury fillings removed and stopped eating processed meats ie pizza rolls and hot pockets.</p>

<p>at this point besides my first hand experience i see a hundred reasons not to touch flouride, its extremely dangerous when concentrated.</p>

<p>why injest something thats only good for your teeth anyway?  would you want hair and skin products in your intestines?</p>

<p>why does the government care soooo much about teeth health all of a sudden when flouride comes up?</p>

<p>especially as the color of my teeth was ruined by flourosis as a child, it discolors teeth.  </p>

<p>its an industrial byproduct and companies like ge save megabucks by disposing of it in our water supply.</p>

<p>after my experience it clearly has mind and spirit properties that limit a person, and yes im talking about the third or dharma eye, but see for yourself, i dont want to say too much about that because it is not a necessary part of the argument.</p>

<p>see for yourself, get non flouridated baby water for a few months it costs next to nothing to run the experiment, but i havent gotten a single peson to try i suppose because what if you have to live in a world where you know the people in charge are poisoning everyone so blatantly?</p>

<p>which will it be the red pill or the blue?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m happy to hear about your experiences, and that it turned out to be a positive one. I&#39;ve got a friend who has recently had problem with too little melatonin production, which makes it hard for him to sleep at night.  I&#39;m suspecting it&#39;s the flouride, but I can&#39;t say for sure. I&#39;ve heard that the pineal gland is like a magnet to flouride which is a part of the brain, which is a part that controls when one should sleep, for example.</p>

<p>How&#39;s your teeth by the way now? I guess they are a &quot;rotting&quot; at a much faster pace, am I right? ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t had any other problems, I use flouiridated touthpaste but I don&#39;t swallow it. </p>

<p>I was given special fl treatments every year from like 7-12, it ruined the development of my teeth so i have basically 2 tones that make it look really wierd, especially on my front teeth, so I got bonding that wears out every 3 years or so because it yellows faster.  </p>

<p>I may have some cavities in my molars but i&#39;m getting old and am not that great about brushing before I go to sleep and eating sugar, but otherwise no it&#39;s not that big of a deal.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure I get fl in some amounts because all the animals and plants are fed/watered with it, but drinking it in all of my water was definitely having clouding affects on my brain.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know anything about the pineal gland, I avoid that specific claim because I haven&#39;t been convinced exactly because that&#39;s what it is, but for me my head feels different and it is a very stark.  </p>

<p>Like I said, it&#39;s not that difficult to go off it or lower your dose significantly, thankfully they usually(though not in poor areas, go figure) sell baby water without fl.  </p>

<p>But if you are not doing things where your spirituality, for lack of a better word, is being used, you might not notice.  But as you practice insight, eventually you get very sensitive to what your own body is telling you.   Because I know most americans and most people are not spiritual and are not developing insight practice, it would not surprise me though if many people were not sensitive enough to test it.  </p>

<p>But then again, that is an affect of fl, making spirituality less interesting, fulfilling, rewarding, and so of course people are over time so jaded to the idea of pursuing this path, of course they don&#39;t value these things.  </p>

<p>For instance it has made me a lot more sympathetic to the plight of others and I have a lot more difficulty observing others in pain, watching people be manipulated, letting myself be manipulated, i.e. watching commercials is so offensive to me on so many levels I have to mute them because I can&#39;t watch people be brainwashed right in front of me with such ease.  </p>

<p>fluoride does not help your teeth by ingestion. This is fact.    you do not drink suntan lotion.  You are trying to rationalize drinking what once was used to kill rats and bugs.. It kills pests.  Are you a pest in someone else&#39;s eyes??   That is a hard side to debate for and still sound rational. LOL Just have faith. stake your life on your faith in your leaders..Prove your faith to your leaders by drinking poison when they command you to..And convince others to have faith in their all knowing wisdom also........DRINK THE RAT POISON it&#39;s so good for your teeth, so sayeth your lord.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The dose is so little that is not harmfull to you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit. Poison is poison. A tiny bit of rat poison (which can actually be made from fluoride) probably won&#39;t kill you right away, but that doesn&#39;t make it good for you. There are cumulative negative health effects that build up over time from prolonged exposure to any toxin, including fluoride.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People in the past had worse teeths than we have today (because of no flouride)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit. People in the past had worse teeth because they didn&#39;t floss or brush their teeth, and they didn&#39;t have regular teeth cleanings and access to dentistry that we have today. Some countries in Europe that have never fluoridated their water have healthier teeth than places in the U.S. that use fluoride. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flouride helps clean the water</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit. This doesn&#39;t even make sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>toothpaste(with flouride) gives you better breath</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit. Not brushing and flossing and eating shitty, sugary foods gives you bad breath. I haven&#39;t used fluoride toothpaste in years and my breath is perfect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have used flouride for a long time, and I&#39;m fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit. Just because you don&#39;t drop dead instantly doesn&#39;t mean something is not hurting you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If flouride is so bad for you, why is it still used?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main reason is that fluoride represents mass medication. The reasoning is that because a certain percentage of the population doesn&#39;t take care of their teeth, medicating them with fluoride will improve their tooth health. The people that do take of their teeth don&#39;t need fluoride but they can take the health hit for the greater good.</p>

<p>The secondary reasons are conspiracy related: it allows big corporations to sell their toxic industrial waste (which is where fluoride comes from) and paid to literally dump it into the water system.  It also creates a dumber, more docile population. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you! Nice to know from someone who hasn&#39;t used fluoride in years. That people in the past had bad teeth seems to be mainly because they didn&#39;t brush/floss as much as we did (or never) and also because of their diet. I guess stuff like smoking was a one of the main causes for bad teeth back then, since everybody smoked, and people smoked all the time.</p>

<p>I love how you said it&#39;s good for the teeth&#39;s health, but what about the rest of the body? ;)</p>

<p>Nice to know that you got a good breath after all these years! :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m happy to hear about your experiences, and that it turned out to be a positive one. I&#39;ve got a friend who has recently had problem with too little melatonin production, which makes it hard for him to sleep at night.  I&#39;m suspecting it&#39;s the flouride, but I can&#39;t say for sure. I&#39;ve heard that the pineal gland is like a magnet to flouride which is a part of the brain, which is a part that controls when one should sleep, for example.</p>

<p>How&#39;s your teeth by the way now? I guess they are a &quot;rotting&quot; at a much faster pace, am I right? ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are dosed constantly all day every day  for your entire lifetime, and you are, that is NOT a low dose.</p>

<p>It is industrial waste. </p>

<p>It reduces IQ </p>

<p>It has no good effect on adult teeth, </p>

<p>It produces bone damage . </p>

<p>There are no redeeming qualities. Shame on you for your support of this atrocity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s in your water all day every day. It&#39;s in your drinks other than water, It&#39;s used to process every meal you ever eat. It has been force fed to you for your entire life, every day .</p>

<p>That is absolutely not a low dose.</p>

<p>It has no redeeming qualities.</p>

<p>It&#39;s used to dumb you down and keep you calm so that powerful people can control you better and make more profit while getting rid of neurotoxic industrial waste at a massive profit.</p>

<p>It is criminal activity of the worst kind.</p>
