<p>...even when my article is submitted by some random user I&#39;ve never met, it gets deleted from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>ME</p>

<p>Hi mods, may I submit this story?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.collegetimes.tv/feds-sue-stevens-henager-college/">http://www.collegetimes.tv/feds-sue-stevens-henager-college/</a></p>

<p>Cheers and thanks ~</p>

<hr/>

<p>PoliticsMod[M]</p>

<p>No. That&#39;s your own content. If it was good someone would find it and submit it here on their own and you wouldn&#39;t have to spam.</p>

<hr/>

<p>ME</p>

<p>Okay thanks anyway.</p>

<p>Trying to hurt my feelings wasn&#39;t really necessary.</p>

<hr/>

<p>PoliticsMod[M]</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to hurt your feelings. You are most likely in violation of Reddit&#39;s spam policy and will probably be banned eventually for all your self posting. I was trying to give you a heads up, but you are free to ignore that and face the potential consequences.</p>

<hr/>

<p>ME</p>

<p>We have a great relationship with most subs on Reddit.</p>

<p>There are thousands of spammers on here using 10-20 fake usernames. We opt for honesty, and passionate discussions, rather than fake story submissions.</p>

<p>Anyway cheers and best wishes --</p>

<hr/>

<p>PoliticsMod[M]</p>

<p>But again, if your stories are so good then why don&#39;t people just submit them on their own? That works just fine for most sites, what makes yours so different that you have to submit all your own content?</p>

<p>Organic submission and curation of articles is the backbone of this site and you guys are trying to bypass that all together. This isn&#39;t Facebook or Twitter which exist as a platform for business to reach customers. This is reddit and it is an insular community and works in a whole different way.</p>

<hr/>

<p>ME</p>

<p>We are an independent blog with just a few writers, in contrast with like a Huffington Post with millions of dollars to spend on promoted Tweets or Facebook advertising, etc.</p>

<p>If I wasn&#39;t involved on Reddit, it would take years for my stories to get discussed by the relevant audiences. I also regularly submit stories from other blogs that I respect and read.</p>

<p>Some of our stories get submitted or discussed on Reddit but not very often. Now that Facebook blocks most stories from news feed, its pretty much just Twitter or Reddit for independent websites. Even Google search has infamously begun favoring corporate news sources in the past few updates i.e. Google Penguin, etc.</p>

<p>I know 5 years ago Reddit was more private and all but now its one of the main traffic sources on the web and unfortunately quite controlled by (no offense) a small handful of mods. It just seems like the exclusive mentality is kind of in denial of how big Reddit has actually become.</p>

<p>If you check my post history nearly all my stories are well received. It seems like heavy moderating is not really necessary with the rather clever algorithm that Reddit has. Junk stories get buried pretty quickly. I know <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> and <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> get huge traffic though, so maybe its different for some of the bigger subs.</p>

<p>Honestly it just seems kinda backwards that corporate social networks with shareholders to please are less restrictive than should-be open-minded communities like Reddit. Like, why does Reddit welcome transparency for AMAs from web guy so-and-so but if that guy wants to post articles from his website, he needs to create other handles so that nobody down-votes him. Kinda backwards.</p>

<hr/>

<p>noeatnosleep[M]</p>

<p>You&#39;ve just basically admitted that you&#39;re only interested in Reddit from a traffic standpoint.</p>

<p>We&#39;re not interested in people like that posting their own content. If we did, 90% of this subreddit would be people posting their own stuff.</p>

<hr/>

<p>ME</p>

<p>I did not say that. I said I am passionate about discussions, and Reddit is one of the biggest social websites on the internet right now.</p>

<p>You ignore my entire response. If I only cared about traffic, I would spam links from a dozen different accounts and would not be honest about my CollegeTimes connection.</p>

<p>If some of my articles can get more traffic due to my involvement, I am overjoyed and my topics can garner more discussion.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t seem to realize is Reddit is already 90% people posting their own stuff.</p>

<hr/>

<p>hansjens47[M]</p>

<p>Here is the reddit.com official policy on self-promotion</p>

<p>In short,</p>

<p>You&#39;re spammer if you&#39;re not a natural member of the community, but make submissions to an end.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not a spammer if you&#39;re a normal member of the community who submits content as part of normal redditing.</p>

<p>That&#39;s an awful lot of work, and is very different from what&#39;s acceptable on facebook and twitter. The user-recommended nature of reddit it&#39;s major advantage over other websites.</p>

<p>As content creators it&#39;s probably frustrating that the success of your content is out of your hands, but that&#39;s the nature of reddit.</p>

<hr/>

<p>ME</p>

<p>Fair enough. So then, what in your book is an acceptable amount of involvement in the Reddit community to not be considered a spammer?</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t answer that question, then trying to label me a spammer seems rather unfair.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason why most subs happily accept my involvement. The mods know that I&#39;m connected to CollegeTimes, but the links and opinions I share are legitimate and contribute to discussions.</p>

<p>The only problem you really have with me is my username, it seems.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Waldoh[M]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You ignore my entire response.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, you are ignoring the rules made by the admins of the site. About 30% of your submissions are from the collegetimes domain, and the self-promotion wiki that you are ignoring states that you should be keeping that number under 10% or else risk being banned by the admins.</p>

<p>Go ahead and make a dozen accounts submitting collegetimes links, but you&#39;ll risk having the domain itself banned from reddit.</p>

<hr/>

<p>ME</p>

<p>Clearly, you are not trying to have a beneficial discussion with me.</p>

<p>But at least you finally discovered the 10% rule, hopefully your colleagues do as well.</p>

<p>If you go back the reason our discussion began it was because I was submitting a post from my own website. Instead of telling me that the story was inappropriate for <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> or that I should submit 9/10 stories first to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, I was simply told my username matched my website and thus I could not submit it.</p>

<p>If you as mods could follow the rules that we users follow, Reddit would be a much happier place.</p>

<hr/>

<p>PoliticsMod[M]</p>

<p>Here is the reddit.com official policy on self-promotion:</p>

<p>In short,</p>

<p>You&#39;re spammer if you&#39;re not a natural member of the community, but make submissions to an end.
This is what you do.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not a spammer if you&#39;re a normal member of the community who submits content as part of normal redditing.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t do this. You are only here to promote your blog.</p>

<p>As content creators it&#39;s probably frustrating that the success of your content is out of your hands, but that&#39;s the nature of reddit.</p>

<p>This seems very accurate, you do appear to be frustrated that we won&#39;t let you spam our subreddit.</p>

<p>If you as a user could follow the rules that the owners of this site created, Reddit would be a much happier place.</p>

<hr/>

<p>ME</p>

<p>You still have not said why my story was unacceptable to your sub.</p>

<p>Now you are backtracking and trying to explain yourself in hindsight. No, I&#39;m not here only to promote my blog. Stop saying that, please, and check out my user activity and positive relationship with dozens of subs on Reddit. You are now repeating each other in desperation.</p>

<p>You have not quoted anything that explains why my story was unacceptable, you&#39;ve only said my username matched my website thus I could not submit.</p>

<p>Now you say that I&#39;m not a natural member, despite less than 10% of my Reddit activity being connected to my website, which is precisely within Reddit guidelines.</p>

<p>Which one is it, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> mods? You guys are the very definition of a circle-jerk.</p>

<p>How else can I word this question: What, in your mind, would make my story acceptable?</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t answer that, it proves that you are blindly banning me from your sub for personal reasons that have no relevance to Reddit guidelines, i.e. the 10% rule.</p>

<hr/>

<p>luster[M]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You still have not said why my story was unacceptable to your sub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We do not accept any posts from spammers regardless of the content of the post.</p>

<hr/>

<p>ME</p>

<p>You seem to equate spammer with &#39;anyone connected to the story&#39;s domain&#39;...</p>

<p>If that is true, you should update your FAQ, and admit that your sub does not abide by community-wide Reddit guidelines in the process.</p>

<p>Apparently Huffington Post etc. spammers are acceptable though, it would seem.</p>

<hr/>

<p>todayilearned83[M]</p>

<p>Attempting to manipulate or strongarm your way into being allowed to spam this sub will get you nowhere. I have reported your account and domain to admins.</p>

<p>screenshot: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/vPSGfiv.png">http://i.imgur.com/vPSGfiv.png</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>ME</p>

<p>I have no interest or hope in submitting stories to your sub at this point.</p>

<p>I&#39;m merely trying to clarify what your sub&#39;s rules are, and instead you try to report me.</p>

<p>Wow, really guys? This is exactly what&#39;s wrong with Reddit lately.</p>

<hr/>

<p>todayilearned83[M]</p>

<p>There&#39;s no &quot;try to report&quot;, I did report.</p>

<p>The FAQ of reddit does what &quot;constitute spamming&quot;.  If i see weird urls being posted by people constantly and then I run the program on them and it shows that they&#39;re spamming.

    <div class="md"><p>Downvotes should never scare mods as integration is crucial to proper authority, you need to feel the right to say anything you want to but have the ability to understand why you need to feel that way in the first place. You will always be wrong with your words so just don&#39;t give yourself stress or become blind to unreason. Chaos, as you play with every day, cannot be played with without respect. You also should not play with chaos out of respect. But all work and no play would have never lead to the discoveries we truly take for granted today. </p>

<p>What I am trying to say is, the effort is nice I am sure a lot in the sub actually appreciate it in their own ways, however when one seeks to find orderly discussion you must give respect in such a way that everyone no matter how many &lt;insert reason to look down upon|racism/nazi/jew/black/pink/etc&gt; is a representation of all of us with their perception since in the long run each interaction anyone ever has in todays world actually effects the whole. Sure nobody deserves it but if we never observe it in our world we will lose the ability to respect even the most &quot;involving&quot; type of leadership. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t ban you.  By this thread I&#39;m kind of glad that you got banned.  You&#39;re probably the kind of guy that would be calling out people and being banned for being a unproductive member of the community. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong. Reddit allows 10% of user activity to be from your own sources.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty obvious when a user is being &#39;naturally&#39; involved and when they are not. Generally, most mods will say &#39;natural&#39; entails joining the conversations on the subs you are active on, and not being solely focused on promoting your own content.</p>

<p>If a user&#39;s own content is well-received, up-voted, and appropriate for a sub, that is not &#39;spam&#39; to most people.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these lines are interpreted all too often by passive-aggressive, power-tripping keyboard warriors.</p>

<p>It&#39;s against the rules of reddit to promote your own content to try to get views to your website. It&#39;s called spamming.

<p>In the spirit of transparency, would you like to help us Americans get more transparent commentary back into <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>?  You used to find real news there all the time.

<li><p>Some serious investigation of the ongoing national travesty at Guantanamo (and other more secret prisons)</p></li>

<p>Etc.</p>

<p>As Americans started to realize that we had been duped and Obama = Bush, news stories pointing that out got disappeared.  Can you help us fix this?</p>

<p>Guantanamo Bay is only political if there is explicit political content as part of the story. CIA interventionism, again is only <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> if it&#39;s explicitly political or brings in a explicitly American political opinion into it. All those stuff must be explicitly American in focus and not &quot;Just because it&#39;s a American organization&quot;.

<p>I guess we all realize that what is at stake is the type of political news that makes it to the eyeballs of a large number of readers.  Please consider that transparency and fair posting/voting are critical not only to USA readers who want to make their country a better place, but to all the people around the world whose lives are impacted (too often tragically) by the decisions that the US government makes (seemingly divorced from voter intent).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, on one of the subreddits I moderate, some companies will post advertisements for their products (blatant, such as &quot;Live near CityTown? Call 555-555-5555 for the best takeout you can buy!&quot;). This is not tolerated, and it is no different if an owner of a news website only posts links to their website, whether it is in a &quot;friendly&quot; matter, or in efforts to try and get more traffic/ad revenue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well what if the username wasn&#39;t linked? There are some people that post from say CNN for example repeatedly since that&#39;s the only site they get their news from(hypothetical). Like if you &#39;appear&#39; to be a common user but did post 25% from just one sight, say a major publication? Just wondering to get better insight on it.</p>

<p>We do.  Read the entire reddit wiki.  We follow all of them + rules that are made to control spam and the promotion of posting <em>original content</em> which isn&#39;t <strong>spam</strong>.</p>

<p>No, you haven&#39;t. You even copy/pasted my response showing you exactly why you haven&#39;t. The reddit admins have a policy regarding self-promotion that you aren&#39;t following. The moderators can&#39;t choose to override these rules even if we wanted to. </p>

<p>So again, an overwhelming majority of your submissions are from the collegetimes domain, about 30% the last time I checked. You need to be keeping that number at 10% or less or you are by reddit&#39;s definition, a spammer. </p>

<p>You had the attention and time of a bunch of different mods trying to give you information that can help you, yet you insisted on ignoring the advice. The same rules apply to you as they do to anyone caught spamming. If the Huffington post has a hundred accounts submitting their own content, as long as each account engages in the community and keeps the self-promotion of their domain under 10% they are most likely fine, if they are caught violating those rules their posts are removed the same as yours was. </p>

<p>This whole thing would only be a conspiracy if the rules that you were violating were some sort of secret back-room scheme. But they&#39;re not. Anyone can view the rules, and there&#39;s a nice link right above the submit button that goes right to them every time you post something.</p>

<p>Other than your feelings being hurt, I just can&#39;t understand your need to create an argument from nothing</p>
