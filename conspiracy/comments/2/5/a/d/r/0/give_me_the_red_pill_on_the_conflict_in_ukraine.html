    <div class="md"><p>Here is the 30 second report on what is happening in the Ukraine:</p>

<p>1) America funded a Neo-Nazi coup overthrow of the democratically elected Ukrainian government.  Some say we are spending $5billion a day or week or something.  Either way, lots of money supporting Nazi terrorists.</p>

<p>2) Nazis overtook the government and are now killing pro-Russian protestors, that are usually unarmed, and murdered them in horrific manners.</p>

<p>3) Putin has made several aggressive moves to let America know he isn&#39;t taking their BS, and our mainstream media is reporting all of this as if the Nazis that illegally overthrew the Ukraine are on some peacekeeping mission in Africa.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great synopsis. I&#39;d add it&#39;s more NATO expansion as well, where NATO is just another western aligned military outfit that keeps everybody &quot;liberated,&quot; wherever they happen to be. The west wants Ukraine to be a NATO country as well. The people, as you might expect, just want to live their lives and the people who run our government see the globe as a chessboard that they themselves must dominate. It&#39;s literally insane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So $200million per year? (this is quite honestly on a macro level very little) You do realize that this is one of the most corrupt countries in the world and that money probably ended up in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/video/world/europe/100000002732759/inside-the-museum-of-corruption.html">Yanukovych museum of corruption estate</a>?</p>

<p>To even think that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UIvYM9w9QY">half a million people</a> are USA puppets and not a populist movement is quite a stretch. Yes USA exhibits tremendous pressure across the globe. But you are ignorant if you think that the only reason that half a million people would join EuroMaidan because the USA funded some fucking NGO. This is quite obviously a populist movement.</p>

<p>Whats next all of these revolutions/riots are USA sponsored? Give me a break...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me ask you this. If USA spent $5 billion to start a coup? How much has Kremlin spent to install their puppet state? You do know yanukovych son is worth $200 billion. While Sr is $70 billion. Tymoshenko who is worth about the same, and who everyone thinks is pro-west also was Putin&#39;s bitch. You do realize Russia due to its geographic proximity spends waaaaaay more money on Ukrainian puppet state than the USA could ever on a coup. </p>

<p>Sure the IMF, EU, USA, and Russia has had a hand in all of this mess. But to claim that this revolution is orchestrated ONLY by international interest is downright offensive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so pretty much what you&#39;re saying that everything happens in this world is USA government doing? That is funny. Do you even know anything about Ukraine? I mean do you read anything except conspiracy websites?</p>

<p>If you actually knew anything about the country and the vast amounts of inequality and corruption it has, and the fact that this nation has been literally raped by all of its neighbors for thousands of years. From Poland to Lithuania to Russia to Turkey to Mongols to Nazis to communists. Everyone shat on the Ukrainian people, and for the first time in almost 90 years this nation has some sort of national unity about some sort of issue. And yet you think this nation of 46+ million is yet somehow just USA pawns. That noone out there actually maybe thinks Yanukovych is a criminal and that EU is better than Customs Union?</p>

<p>Firstly, this requires there to actually be evidence of the illuminati currently existing. Secondly, are there any specific examples of them pulling the strings? (not trying to disprove that point, just curious).</p>

Two more articles showing how the Us supports &quot;Freedom&quot; in general and in Cuba. <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/cia-front-usaid-spreading-democracy-gearing-up-in-ukraine-suharto-ii/5381174">Link1</a> <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/us-secretly-created-cuban-twitter-stir-unrest">Link2</a>
You got Victoria Nulands &quot;Fuck the EU&quot; and discussing who should be in the new ukrainian government phonecall. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSxaa-67yGM">Link</a> , she also traveled to Ukraine and handed out cookies. She is married to Robert Kagan co-founder of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century">PNAC</a>
.Senator McCain visited Nazis that are part of the euromaidan movement <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/there-are-no-neo-nazis-in-the-ukraine-and-the-obama-administration-does-not-support-fascists/5370269">Link1</a> <a href="http://www.infowars.com/us-backed-neo-nazi-party-given-key-roles-in-ukrainian-government/">Link2</a>
.On February 21st there was an Agreement on the Settlement of Crisis in Ukraine <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/21/agreement-on-the-settlement-of-crisis-in-ukraine-full-text">Link</a> but the protesters stormerd government buildings none the less and instsalled a coup government consisting of Nazis and oligarchs. <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/whos-who-in-ukraines-new-semi-fascist-government-meet-the-people-the-u-s-and-eu-are-supporting/5372422">Link</a> There were snipers most likely connected to the maidan that did shoot police and protesters <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEgJ0oo3OA8">Link</a> , there were also snipers in Syria and Venezuela not too long ago contemporaneous with US involment in the region.
Russia annexed Crimea to secure their military base. No real invasion happened the military was already legally there. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_Treaty_on_the_Status_and_Conditions_of_the_Black_Sea_Fleet">link</a>  Russia certainly made the referendum happen, maybe the votes are rigged but i wouldnt be surprised if they are in fact not. Ukraine is a divided country, you got ethnic Ukrainians in the west and ethnic Russians in the east. Now you give ethnic Russians in the autonomous Crimea Region the possibility to vote for a hostile <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RxSzSWbcxo">Link</a> coup government that will also sell you to the IMF <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/regime-change-in-ukraine-and-the-imfs-bitter-economic-medicine/5374877">Link</a> or vote for Russia where Crimeans will face a better financial situation. Guess for what the majority will vote? For the same Reasons the rest of the East is resisting the coup government in Kiev. Kiev starts &quot;Anti-Terror&quot; campaigns against the East after visits from US officials. Coincidence?
Now you have the US trying to provoke a reaction from the East or even Russia that would justify NATO involvement and Russia trying to de-escalate because they dont want NATO involvement.
