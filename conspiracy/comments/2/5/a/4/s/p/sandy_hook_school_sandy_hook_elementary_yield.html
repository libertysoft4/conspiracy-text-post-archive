        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Second Edit:</p>

<p>Following the discussion that has taken place in this post, I have come to a conclusion. It appears that the theory that SHES was never a real school is false, there appears to be sufficient evidence that this school did exist and was functional in the past. This does not, however, prove that the school was not defunct leading up to the incident. Even if this were proven to be false, there are still many things left to be explained. I am not sure if we will ever have the full story that everyone can agree upon, but weeding out unfounded theories is an important part of the process. My initial suspicions about the Google Trends numbers turned out to be largely unfounded.</p>

<p>What I have learned today: There are more important issues surrounding this incident to explore than whether or not the school was a real school. The claims that DNA on the gun and car do NOT match Adam Lanza but DO match SOMEONE in the felon database seem much more relevant. I believe I may have come to a premature conclusion when I initially made this post, but feel that I have come closer to the truth in being disproven.</p>

<p>I am not redacting the entire post. One thing I still think is suspicious is item #2 that I listed below. Although I no longer see this result when going to the page, I swear on my honor that I DID see a value of &quot;50&quot; for November 2012 when I first checked out &quot;sandy hook school&quot; this morning. This is of course not the only indicator of premature action by various individuals, such as the tribute facebook pages that predate the shooting. Still plenty of questions to answer here, but I believe we can take the &quot;never was a school&quot; theory off the table.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Initial Post:</p>

<p>This was interesting to me. I decided to see what Google search trends had to say about the search history of &quot;Sandy Hook School&quot; and &quot;Sandy Hook Elementary&quot; and the results raise questions.</p>

<p>First as a reference I searched the district I attended years ago, &quot;mosinee school&quot; a small district in a town of around 4,000 people.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/MwRYjg1.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/MwRYjg1.jpg</a></p>

<p>We see a varied but sustained searchability from 2007 to current day.</p>

<p>Now, take a look at what we see for:</p>

<p>&quot;sandy hook school&quot;
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/nxAMNRt.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/nxAMNRt.jpg</a></p>

<p>and</p>

<p>&quot;sandy hook elementary&quot;
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/M7jaul1.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/M7jaul1.jpg</a></p>

<p>I am not sure which is more interesting of these observations:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>No search history prior to 2012, this school was reported to be a very highly rated and desirable school. I am quite surprised that my small town school which is nothing special (not to cut it down but it&#39;s just an average school district) shows searches prior to 2012 while sandy hook shows 0.</p></li>
<li><p>The result for &quot;sandy hook elementary&quot; shows the rise in searches starting in NOVEMBER 2012 (with a value of &quot;50&quot;) when the news reports of the shooting started in December.</p></li>
<li><p>Search results plummet back to near 0 values immediately after the incident. I understand that the public was most aware of this school during the period of the reporting, but I have a hard time believing that the small district of Mosinee is showing continued interest while Sandy Hook has tapered off.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Am I misunderstanding the Google Trends reporting system or is this another indicator of something strange about this school?</p>

<p>TL;DR.... My small hometown school shows sustained searchability prior to 2012 while Sandy Hook shows zero.</p>

<p>Edit: I just checked out &quot;sandy hook hoax&quot; </p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=sandy%20hook%20hoax">http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=sandy%20hook%20hoax</a></p>

<p>Apparently this is searched more frequently in recent months than the other 2 I listed above.....</p>

<p>This is factually incorrect. What happens is, the massive spike, for obvious reasons, in December 2012 blows away all search interest prior to that point, making it APPEAR zero. If you search for &quot;Sandy Hook school&quot; before that time - say, for 2011 - you&#39;ll see there was activity.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/7nXd3gG">http://imgur.com/7nXd3gG</a></p>

<p>The same for 2009 and 2010. This looks like yet another case of Sandy Hook conspiracists mis-interpreting data, and leaping to a conspiratorial conclusion that&#39;s entirely unwarranted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To all visitors to this thread, AZSnakePit has outed himself as a supporting and stating known lies.  He has presented heavily doctored photographs to back his lies, and in addition to this, has cherry picked data to support his incorrect claims.  Going through many, many dozens of examples only to find the one single instance that appears similar to what he&#39;s claiming as fact.  Please do not believe his lies outright without first reviewing the posts that have been buried by shills in this thread.  Their use or down/up votes to hide the truth is sickening, and only proves the lengths they will go to obscure the truth.  </p>

<p>If the number of downvotes appears strange, it&#39;s very likely because the original post was truthful and they are stopping at nothing to hide this truth from you.  Do not allow it. This is all these cowards have left.

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely incredible username.  Props.  </p>

<p>Long before or after the prosthesis were played off as actual bone and flesh blown to smithereens, as he&#39;s kept alive by cloth loosely wrapped around his &quot;wounds&quot; showing NO BLOOD, a flushed face (not possible with such blood loss), him being lifted into a wheelchair over 5 minutes after the bombing, when people that were far less injured right next to him were removed BY STRETCHER prior to him, even though triage protocols would have helped him before anyone else.</p>

<p>Also notice the complete and total lack or shrapnel in any if the flags and banners mere feet away from the blast location.  Not a single one exhibits any holes or damage caused by the alleged shrapnel in used in the bombs.  Also watch the military personnel that were immediately rushed in.  Not to help the injured, but to pull down the undamaged flags and banners.  </p>

<p>ALSO, listen to the medical examiner.  He is shadowed by a camera in the immediate aftermath of the staged bombing, and within the first minute, before he can even get within 20 feet of the small number of injured, he is already claiming that &quot;there are at least three people dead.&quot; Mind you, he has ONLY witnessed blast zone #1, has not touched any wounded person or had radio contact with anyone, yet is able to predict with perfect accuracy the exact number of fatalities.</p>

<p>Also, review the two alleged blast zones, and start counting the wounded.  Zero blood begins to flow 2+ minutes after the blast, and there is no way there are 200+ injured people in either of these zones.  </p>

<p>This is also a fatal botch by the Sandy Hoax team.  They claim the school is fully functional with over 500 students, then fail to issue am photographic or video evidence of an evacuation of more than 30 students.  A school worth, or a classroom worth.  You decide. Back to Boston...They fucked up yet again, as with Sandy Hoax, and this is what kills the official story.  The fact that they would lie about this, proves they would lie about anything and kills all credibility they once had.  Do not believe the lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well here&#39;s a guess. Maybe the search numbers were so high during the event that the old searches were watered down by the largeness of the shooting that they basically are too small compared to the spike to register readable on there... Just a guess though, this is good info. Your school never got huge press so every statistic is in a decent range, while Sandy Hook&#39;s huge spike made the smallness of the old searches turn into outliers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Scale does not change the number of hits, and what was captured by the same aybafk machine.  </p>

<p>Also, over 500 students were claimed to attend Sandy Hook Elementary.  They were evacuated while the school was surrounded by news.media.  Cameras, journalists, and many news helicopters.  Of the 500+ students supposedly evacuated, no video has been released.  Instead we have obvious actors walking around the firehouse in an attempt to make their relatively small group appear as though we are seeing the results or 500+ parents waiting for their children to be released.  This video is clear as dsy, and has not been addressed by anyone attempting to sell the official fiction or this staged event as fact.  </p>

<p><strong>AZSnakePit</strong> has taken the lead disinfo role here, and they are working overtime to bury this thread or damning evidence.  I have requested that he show is the photos or video or an evacuation of &gt;500 students, which he will be unable to provide.  Please view his credibility for being unable to offer basic evidence of Sandy Hoax not being a fully engineered drill sold as an actual event.</p>

It&#39;s as if they realized no-one takes the reptilian shit seriously any more, and they need something new, but just as lunatic, to make conspiracy theorists look bad.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re spot on.  They also do not abide by the Americans with Disabilities Act, something that a fully functioning school would NEVER run afoul of.  The school was quite obviously once a functional school, but at the time of the alleged shooting (a fictional event) it was quite obviously only used for school district storage.  Seen also in the few short minutes of unredacted police video is a case of beer for Christ sake.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s clear as can possibly be Sandy Hoax Elementary was <strong>not</strong> an active or in use school.  For all the shills that claim otherwise, we have requested time and time again, and you&#39;ve failed to deliver.  According to the official reports and testimony, SHES had well over 500 students in attendance that day.  Simply show us video or photographic evidence of the evacuation of that many children.  Should be simple enough, as the news media was, according to Twitter, staging as early as 0800 (note: another fatal flaw. The first reports came in s round 0930, police on the scene a little before 0940).  The.evacuation should have been fully covered because at this time, news reporters and cameras were on the ground and in helicopters before the evacuation started.</p>

<p>Also shillls, you need to tell us why the exact number of Christmas trees that someone allegedly donated after the shooting were presented and captured on video behind the fire house well before this even hit the national media.  Who was the mindreader that knew exactly how many trees to donate, and then hide at the firehouse BEFORE Tue shooting ever began.</p>

<p>This story, or should I say proven lie, is so fucking ridiculous.  Did they even try.  After notching Aurora and 9/11, you would think they would actually make an effort NOT to fuck this one up.  Apparently not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is absolutely not true, i have family that live in newtown and frequent the area quite often.  i have driven by that fire station and school well over a hundred times, and know people that attended the school.<br/>
i do acknowledge that there is something suspicious about the tragedy, but as us normal citizens do not have access to digital communication records from the house, we may never know.  perhaps that is just my brain trying to rationalize how something terrible like that can just randomly happen in a nice community.   what may have initiated my suspicion was how the local media was not responsible in reporting the events (protests and opposition) leading to the now passed and near pointless firearms + magazine bans.  anyone opposing it was instantly turned into the bad guy in the extremely rare chance they made it to TV. and yes there was plenty of opposition.  our local news is really disgusting, but its probably like that everywhere  :\</p>

Never captured, and muchbloke Boston&#39;s hidden 100+ or so, all we see in any of the Sandy Hoax footage is never more than 200 souls.  It was so understaffed, they had the (badge wearing) participants clearly walk in circles, attempting to make it appear as though there were 500+ students and an equal or greater number of parents and siblings.

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, to me it seems at least from the web archive that Sandy Hook Elementary WAS a real elementary school. What I find curious is that there is no record of the Newtown district website from 2008 to the end of 2009. </p>

<p>You may have seen the video from youtube user logicoverauthoirty in which he demonstrated that a large number of homes (in Newtown) were transferred to the current owners for $0 on christmas day, 2009. I guess it is a little interesting that we start to see archives of the Newtown school district website start up again in 2010 after 2 years of no snapshots.</p>

<p>No, it isn&#39;t. I just checked archive.org for my own site, which has been up continuously since September 1997. There&#39;s a gap there in 2009 and 2010 as well. I guess I must be a false flag. </p>

<p>You&#39;re comparing a screenshot of a web page, which really <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be stored as a JPEG in the first place, to a photograph, which is what the format was invented for. It&#39;s not a fair comparison.</p>

<p>What the heck are you talking about? Are you talking about <a href="https://i.imgur.com/L156ZTC.png">this</a>? That corresponds to the little black bar on the 2009|2010 line, not to an edit. It&#39;s in the original. Look again.</p>

<p>Nobody was saying there&#39;s <em>literally</em> no data there, just that there&#39;s less. Considering that bar represents one archival in that entire blank period, yes, there is less data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only your first reference shows the massive gap.  And NEITHER show the absolute lack or any reference online prior to two years ago.  That, in and of itself is quite damning.  The photo forensics shows quite clearly that you edited your image.  And when the examples do not back your claim, you can only be considered a liar.  Is this the end all, be all proof that Sandy Hoax was engineered?  Absolutely not.  But when the totality of evidence is weighed and taken into account, it paints a very clear picture.  The school, based on all unredacted video and photographic evidence shows a school that has not been used in years.  Bathrooms that are nowhere near useable for children.  An absolute lack of all Americans With Disabilities Act requirements.  Something NOT PRESENT in any of the schools you referenced as &quot;examples,&quot; examples mind you that did not even support your original position no less.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll gladly debate this one finer point with you, but be prepared to lie some more to cover all of the other proof to Sandy Hoax being pure Mossad fiction.  A drill that was presented as real life.  Though not having any supporting evidence to back any of that up.  </p>

<p>I also see you&#39;ve brought your shill buddies in.  It&#39;s always interesting to see how idiotic you fools are with your overuse of downvotes.  Your position is widely viewed as an absolute lie here, yet magically you receive upvotes with no corresponding comments.  I&#39;ve marked you appropriately fir what you are.  Still, by all means continue.  Prove your lies with firm evidence.  Not cherry picked schools in the wayback archive, and clearly Photoshopped pictures, done as you claim to &quot;not DOXX yourself.&quot;  Something not physically possible unless you have something to hide.</p>

<p>An administrative assistant at the Assessor’s Office, Andrea Santillo, promptly returned my phone call. She said that the Newtown city government recently had switched to a new computer system and had not been able to enter the property data for all Newtown homes. So the computer used the 12/25/2009 and $0 as, respectively, a “filler” default sale date and price.</p>

<p>If you check the database (as I have actually done), you&#39;ll see the $0 price applies to a broad range of properties, many with absolutely no conceivable connection to the shooting, and even empty lots. </p>

<p>O RLY? Let&#39;s pick another town in Connecticut, using the same kind of database: Bridgeport.</p>

<p><a href="http://data.visionappraisal.com/BridgeportCT/search.asp">http://data.visionappraisal.com/BridgeportCT/search.asp</a></p>

<p>Put in, &quot;Main St&quot; as your search term. Look at the very first results.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://data.visionappraisal.com/BridgeportCT/findpid.asp?iTable=pid&amp;amp;pid=3406">12 Main St</a> - Last sale date 4/19/2012, Sale Price = $0</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve provided a very small sample that is not present with Sandy Hook, Connecticut.  These are nowhere near the magnitude that enveloped practically every street in the town.  Your examples are single instances, and not entire cities.  He&#39;ll, not even entire subdivisions.  Care to try to back your claim with factual examples or entire cities being updates to wipe their sales entirely off the books?</p>

<p>We are witness to the wholesale payments/bribes of an entire city for their criminal participation in a pre-planned and executed FEMA drill passed off to the world as an actual, real life event.  Which is now being used to further restrict the God given natural human rights or a nation.  </p>

<p>We are not foolish enough to believe these lies.  And until solid proof and independently verified evidence is presented, such as a display of the more than 500 alleged students being evacuated from the grounds that day (NOT PRESENT IN ANY PHOTO OR VIDEO RELEASED TO DATE), a valid explanation for why they did NOT rush ANY of the injured or even just recently passed children, performing the required CPR and transport to the awaiting Danbury hospital located mere minutes away from the school, or even as we&#39;ve requested multiple times, the death certificates for the alleged murdered souls.  </p>

<p>These are reasonable expectations that so far have not been met.  And the reasons for not releasing them is quite clear.  The event was not real.  Real people did not perish.  The small, ~2,500 residents, who by and large were new residents to the city, were paid off through the full payment of their mortgage, for participating in the stated drill.  Paul Vance have his chilling warning to all these people when he stated that any participant that shared the truth would be attacked by the state and federal govt. if they were to speak.  That wasn&#39;t a message to us.  It was a threat to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you after seeing what some other people have had to say and looking closer at some things myself. The school is/was real, and that is actually quite easy to prove. What questions still remain for me: </p>

<p>Was the school defunct in the couple of years leading up to the shooting?</p>

<p>What was the deal with the men running around in the woods?</p>

<p>Why was the S.T.A.R.T. triage protocol not followed by the emergency responders? Why did the ambulances not go directly to the school? Why were the bodies left inside the school?</p>

<p>It was also quite strange that the brand new security system does not have videotape to show us of Lanza entering the school. To me, that would make the official story much more believable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, and I think that is one of the big reasons why people are not buying the official story.</p>

<p>Columbine: video. Virginia Tech: video. Sandy Hook: no video, no photos of the shooter or any victims. </p>

<p>I understand that for parents/family releasing the photos of the victims would be painful, but if they could at least show us a photo of Adam&#39;s body in the school that would probably end many of the theories floating around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bullshit.  The allocated funds would have covered much more than a simple viewer.  All schools worth their weight now have cameras running 24/7.  Sandy Hoax was an apparent exception to this....because it wasn&#39;t a functional school.  Check out Lima just near there, where the police.were filmed storming the building, and the media passed it off as at Sandy Hoax Elementary.  Look at the seciryty system they have. I can tell you with certainty from calling them personally that there record the cameras that blanket the school.</p>

<p>And you are absolutely wrong about the prevalence of cameras in primary schools.  Only 51 percent of primary schools use cameras to monitor their premises, and that includes schools like SHES with only active monitoring systems.

    <div class="md"><p>If this is all they have left, the game is nearly over.  They&#39;ve attempted their hail mary, though it hasn&#39;t worked to sway the minds back into the belief of their fiction.</p>

<p>Sandy Hoax is the failure that has exposed their sickening use of fully engineered false flag events to control the population.  It exposes the absolute corruption of those in positions of authority in the state and federal government, the massive corruption of our propaganda news media, and the lies they will push as fact.  There is a reason why network news viewers has dropped off to a volume smaller than ever seen before in the past.  The people, by and large, no longer believe the lies.  The TV newsman is no longer to be trusted at all.  With abything he says.</p>

<p>At the same time, the supreme court of the nation has proven itself unjust and illegitimate.  No longer worthy of our backing.  The governed no longer give consent.  They are illegitimate, and do not represent the public in any fashion.  The totalitarian control is all they have left.</p>

They have had to increase their shill presence five fold, and they are still failing.  A simple review of YouTube shows that the massive majority is now aware they&#39;ve been lied to.  As they wake up to the fiction of Sandy Hoax, they begin to see the other failed Mossad false flags.  The time of awakening is now.  My goal is to share the truth with everyone I know.
