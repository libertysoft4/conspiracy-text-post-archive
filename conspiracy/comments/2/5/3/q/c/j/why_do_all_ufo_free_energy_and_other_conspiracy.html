        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I thought this would be fun to discuss, so here it goes :)</p>

<p>Recently I watched this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Sz1yWC4nw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Sz1yWC4nw</a>.</p>

<p>After listening to Dr. Steven Greer I was kinda interested in the stuff he was talking about and the fact of it being on RT with a credible host, but then he mentioned The Disclosure Project website <a href="http://www.disclosureproject.org/">http://www.disclosureproject.org/</a> </p>

<p>I went there to have a look and BOOM! Oh no! Not the CRAPPY WEBSITE AGAIN!! WTF is wrong with these conspiracy freaks!!!</p>

<p>Why is there always some shitty website with these people, WTF am I missing here!</p>

<p>Have you ever thought about it? Why all these crazy conspiracy, UFO and free energy websites have such crappy web design? I am amazed at the pattern, like there was a rule that if you talk about something dodgy you have to make a plain html website with minimal design and make it a real pain to navigate. It&#39;s like they would hire the same web designer who tosses online some crappy gif animation and plain text with 90s page layout again and again. Or they don&#39;t trust anyone with their &quot;sensitive&quot; information and therefore make a website themselves in MS Word?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rexresearch.com/">http://www.rexresearch.com/</a> is one typical example. I wonder who is even paying for this domain name for the last 15 years!</p>

<p>It&#39;s 2014 and the people who made these websites never heard of Wordpress? Its fuggin ridiculous! WTF is going on here, is it the NSA, CIA or some other fooked up agency making these websites and then laugh at us? Anyone have any thoughts on that?</p>

<p>Cheers :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guys, come on guys. Sure OP comes off as judgemental, but he does have a point. If I&#39;m trying to sell somebody on these ideas, somebody who may be inherently very skeptical, I&#39;ll have a way easier time opening their eyes by sending them to a site that at the very least is streamlined and remotely up-to-date with links and such. It by no means has to be pretty. But user friendly is kinda nice don&#39;t yah think?</p>

<p>And like OP says, to go from trainwreck to at least functional is 10-30 minutes out of the hosts day. Is that really so much to ask?</p>

<p>To the uninitiated,  perception is reality. Like it or not, people judge books by their covers. Sucks I know, but we want to get this type of info in the heads of as many people as possible right? Why not make it a tad easier?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess, self made websites when the web started getting popular for home use, with little upgrading since. The reason: these people are not web designers, their passions lie with their theories and researching them as well as a need to share, hence the websites. I can imagine having long term beliefs and suddenly the internet is connecting everyone, damn that sounds like an awesome way to get word out and maybe find others, but you gotta remember not everyone cares or is up-to-date themselves on web design, or have time to tweek a long working website. I have also noticed it and it made me question or assume things about the information contained, but only when the content was poor as well. However I always just thought it made sense that they were home made websites, like really home made, like went to borders (when they still existed) and bought a book to follow along with and make an anglefire site. Perhaps they&#39;ve since got their own domain but think about what motivation someone with a site like this would need to upgrade it and get some Helvetica and rounded squares all over the place, make it shiny, why bother as long as it works is my guess. Yes, it is easy to make a wordpress, but it wasn&#39;t around 10 years ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, but one can make a basic Wordpress site with native theme in 2 minutes, why bother with producing 50 html pages and linking them manually? The problem is not with the design so much as for comfortably readable text, navigation and dead links. Also they almost by rule lack a decent search and archive organization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You found yourself a new job. Alex Jones had a crappy web design and a terrible page management until Kurt Nimmo, I think it was him, called him up and offered his help to redesign his sites. They are running like this a few years now.</p>

<p>So if you want a crappy website with nice content changed just called them up and offer your valuable help. For instance you could install them said wordpress blog system with all the features they need plus help them when they get attacked by script kiddies who happen to exploit vulnerabilities in the rather common wordpress blogs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think some people are not that tuned into the web design process. I am always surprised about that as well, and sometimes even meet people much younger than myself &amp; they have no idea about any aspect of WP or templating. I don&#39;t rule out that the sites are made to look crazy to dissuade people from considering the possibility of a conspiracy.</p>

<p>My point would be.... slickness should make us wary just as much as bad design when considering credibility.</p>

<p>I agree to a certain degree, but we are talking about people who are to a large extent interested in this stuff as hobby. I also think those type of &#39;bad design&#39; websites could be used as deterrent used to dissuade people from taking the information as a credible source.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all about appearance only if you lack the ability to effectively discern the credible details, hence your use of &#39;Janky&#39;.</p>

<p>BTW people in third world countries get their health care from the side of a van all of time by doctors who have graduated from the top medical schools around the world. I don&#39;t think they have a hard time being convinced. Suddenly because it&#39;s in the US/Canada it becomes scary?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a rational thought process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>May get buried/ may not get seen/ may get banned, idk the rules of this. But if you want a website, and lack the funds. I will design one for you, well within a meager budget and trust me it will be nice. I am a seasoned professional in the business. I believe, unfortunately, we live in a society where image is everything. I too have seen many informational websites, that will get over looked/ and or laughed at because of the image. The info is great, but the image is wrong. So, as I drink some beer tonight, I open the door to my fellow truth seekers. I&#39;d accept paypal, bit coins, barter don&#39;t matter, just trying to help, it&#39;s really my calling, that&#39;s why I am making the offer. PM me if you&#39;re interested and we can discuss :) .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the implied meaning of free is in what it costs to the environment. Obviously, you can&#39;t simply &quot;get&quot; energy, you have to generate it. There will always be an overhead. You&#39;ll always need engineers to maintain your plant, etc etc. A term like &quot;free energy&quot; isn&#39;t supposed to be taken literally, it&#39;s a buzzword.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I try not to go all in on any single form of government. For instance, our police force, education system, library and fire rescue teams are all socialist style. If it were pure capitalism, you&#39;d have to purchase contracts in order to have response from rescue teams. It&#39;s probably right to say that every system of government is doomed to failure. Our representative republic has been far from perfect, and has decayed in the same fashion as every other democratic capitalism before it. Now if you want to talk about something new, how about totally removing the monetary system?</p>

<p>The way Kerry Cassidy (Project Camelot) explains it is this: They don&#39;t have any money. They can&#39;t afford web design, they can&#39;t afford nice cameras and sound equipment. All the money goes to traveling and setting up meetings with Whistleblowers. No one is cataloging UFO whistleblowers to make money, or be famous, or have a nice website and nice equipment.

<p>This part made me look at your account. Your account confirms what I think of you.</p>

<p>Edit: Yea I&#39;m doubling down. This guy has a two month old account with one post previous to this one. He&#39;s pointing at something that&#39;s about as superficial as can be especially when you consider the fact that web design is not the priority of researchers and that truly great web design costs money. He just so happens to sneak in a ridiculous insult in there by calling people &quot;conspiracy freaks&quot; based on the fact that their web design isn&#39;t up to his standards. That&#39;s not cool, that&#39;s stupid.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve actually read plenty about this subject. I&#39;ve read books, I&#39;ve gone through UFO case files to read up on the most compelling cases, and I never had any trouble. But this guy doesn&#39;t talk about the actual information, he complains that the &quot;crazy conspiracy&quot; websites are hard to navigate. What makes them crazy? Because you can&#39;t navigate their website? Really?</p>

<p>Seriously, yerbus, what&#39;s with your use of the words &quot;freaks&quot; and &quot;crazy&quot;? The only complaint you have is with the layout of their website, is that really it? Bad layout means you are a freak?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Relax, I&#39;m online since 1994 and I have seen shit, freaks and crazy might be too harsh, but I meant it all with their website functionality in mind and not the content. While content might be good and interesting, the functionality of the site is a pain for a reader. If someone appears in a TV interview and suggests to see his website, while his information is good, he might deter the readers immediately by the lack of readability, dead links and poor navigation.</p>

<p>Bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WTF is wrong with these conspiracy freaks!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You specifically said conspiracy freaks. Not poor webdesign freaks. Conspiracy freaks. What is it about their conspiracy and the evidence they use to back up their claim that make them freaks?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why all these crazy conspiracy, UFO and free energy websites have such crappy web design?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, crazy conspiracy. But you failed to dedicate one single sentence in your name calling rant to explain why they are freaks and why they are crazy. You just went ahead and called them freaks and crazy. Again, as someone who&#39;s spent the time to do the reading and look into the backgrounds of the sources, it&#39;s incredibly disrespectful for you to use these blanket insults.</p>

<p>If your objective truly was to strictly criticize the web layout, you would have done that. But you arbitrarily inject these loaded insults into your rant that are idiotic. And the fact your account is 2 months old with a single post on it before this makes this look even more ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s not how you call them out. You call out the bullshit when you see it. You don&#39;t overgeneralize with blanket terms that insults everyone who looks into conspiracies. Try doing that sometimes.</p>
