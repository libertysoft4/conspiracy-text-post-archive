<blockquote>
<p>If you want to know the truth and dirt about what&#39;s going on here in these circles. I&#39;m trying to be as brief (minus these disclaimers) and non technical as possible here so bear with me.</p>

<h1>There&#39;s a few things you need to know:</h1>

<p>A. Ultimately, It&#39;s all about kinetic effect. That&#39;s the end game. Hacking, or whatever &#39;cyber&#39; activities to affect change kinetically.. in the physical world. Think Stuxnet. We&#39;re talking anything from simply breaking in to a target&#39;s wireless AP and configuring it to beacon a particular string (which, btw, comes from an actual training scenario used by the US military).. which can then be zeroed in on for targeting by drone(s). On that note, let&#39;s take a detour to just have a drone refresher. What&#39;s the end game there? Quite literally, Terminator. I will actually make a second, separate, post solely about that to keep this post concise and on-topic. So, that&#39;s on the basic level and it goes all the way to.. well, use your imagination. The key word here that&#39;s all the rage in CYBERCOM circles is <strong>kinetic</strong>. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/cybercity-allows-government-hackers-to-train-for-attacks/2012/11/26/588f4dae-1244-11e2-be82-c3411b7680a9_story.html">Here&#39;s the DoD&#39;s #1 mouthpiece, the Washington Post from 2012 in an article about one of the training regiments they use called CyberCity</a> There&#39;s a ton more I could link, but for anyone that&#39;s &quot;in the know&quot; you would know the significance of this particular thing here. </p>

<p>B. What&#39;s going on now is the Manhattan project of the 21st century. The same vigor with which the United States pursued nuclear weapons in the context of kinetic warfare during the Second World War is being applied to the development of &quot;end all&quot; weapons in the context of cyber warfare (which, from the previous point, is becoming more and more focused on kinetic impacts of cyber activities!)  For all we know, and some have certainly speculated, it&#39;s already on-line, it&#39;s already been done. Don&#39;t be alarmed or confused, this is nothing mythical about this stuff. All we&#39;re talking about on a basic technical here is malware. Just like viruses and all that, but this is special malware. The design goals of this &quot;super malware&quot; include maximum stealth and persistence. Something which cannot be detected, cannot be circumvented or removed and to some extent cannot even be proven to exist, which provides arbitrary level of remote access - be it monitoring or control. As insidious as technologically possible. </p>

<p>Most sources on this are <a href="http://www.toucan-system.com/research/blackhat2012_brossard_hardware_backdooring.pdf">quite technical</a>, also <a href="http://www.securiteam.com/securityreviews/5FP0M1PDFO.html">2</a>, and <a href="http://inertiawar.com/microcode/">3</a> for an average audience, but <a href="http://steveblank.com/2013/07/15/your-computer-may-already-be-hacked-nsa-inside/">an article by Silicon Valley insider Steve Blank</a> sparked a wave of controversy in the (alternate/online) media; 1. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/steveblank/2013/07/15/your-computer-may-already-be-hacked-nsa-inside/">Forbes</a> 2. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-blank/your-computer-may-already_b_3599084.html">Huff Post</a> and there&#39;s plenty more.  Additionally, his claims were backed up by now published documents leaked by Snowden.. <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/catalog-reveals-nsa-has-back-doors-for-numerous-devices-a-940994.html">appearing in Der Spegel</a>. Perhaps the best and my favorite source, which I will link, was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vILAlhwUgIU">Jacob Applebaums now famous/infamous keynote at the most recent Chaos Communication Congress on the militarization of the Internet (and really,  the war on general computation, in general)</a>. But then again.. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m only some random guy with a background in both systems and network administration/engineering and over half a decade experience in incident response and network security testing or claiming such and posting a bunch of fancy blue links.. What would I know about malware? You decide. <strong>Also</strong> how about some (somewhat) <a href="http://cryptome.org/jya/intel-bug.htm">historical precedence</a> for you? And lets not leave out the recent <a href="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/the-many-flaws-of-dualecdrbg.html">Dual_EC_DRBG</a> drama which hit the fan right around the same time Intel released their microcode update for the entire &quot;i&quot; line. Juicy. More? <a href="http://grahamcluley.com/2013/09/nsa-cheated-cryptography/">here&#39;s one</a>. <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd/2013/12/msg00095.html">here&#39;s</a> some Debian mailing list chat on this. And lastly, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/us/nsa-foils-much-internet-encryption.html?hp&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">Here&#39;s the cowardly NY Times on the same topic</a>. </p>

<p>That&#39;s all I&#39;m going put into this post, but I can/will follow it up with more detailed information. That&#39;s really what you need to know.. 1, so called &quot;cyber war&quot; is primarily focused on kinetic impact. 2. After playing around with application level, user mode and even kernel mode malware, state actors have realized that the &quot;money&quot; is in compromising lower, more esoteric levels, of compute systems ultimately culminating in malicious hardware itself; what is commonly refereed to as a &quot;hardware backdoor.&quot; Perhaps the most alarming aspect of this is that it requires the implicit cooperation of chip makers themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are, for the most part, entirely correct. </p>

<p>However, there are plenty of new developments. For one, on the issue of drones - which I didn&#39;t post any follow-up about yet - these developments are barely a decade old and are still in development. We have the seen the first and perhaps second generation waves of killer robots, but just wait till you see what they have in store for you down the road. This isn&#39;t any &quot;secret&quot; knowledge that&#39;s in the dark either.. The US government and psychopathic oligarchs who run it are, in the bigger picture, quite open about what they do with our money for the most part. All you have to do is read the books coming out of DARPA circles back in the early 2000&#39;s when this stuff was brand new to understand what their plans are..<strong>in their own words.</strong> As for so called &quot;cyber war,&quot; these are indeed new developments. Stuxnet was not that long ago and nation-state actors becoming so deeply, yet publicly involved in this sphere is a newer development. Hacking for kinetic impact has always been the domain of sci-fi and sort of in the back of people&#39;s minds, but it is now a demonstrable reality. Look at the whole &quot;CyberCity&quot; exercise and scale that up plus use your imagination a bit. Any major conventional confrontations aka &quot;wars&quot; that we see from here on out will not only have a distinctly &quot;cyber&quot; element to them, but will probably be preceded by some of cyber engagement focused on these kinetic, aka real world, impacts. Right now, there is a war going on.. for long term infiltration of critical control networks all over this planet.. Nation state actors are attempting to stealthily set up shop all over the place. This stuff is in the news all the time now, ie &quot;Iran suspected of being responsible for the deep compromise of sensitive Navy networks&quot; blah blah.. But most people have no idea what it really means. What it really means is your local water/power plant, local hospital, whatever.. might have already had their systems broken into by some nation-state sponsored actors out there.. who just set up command and control and then leave. Why would they do that? Why would they leave control behind if they weren&#39;t planning on coming back to use it at some point? Always blame Iran and China.. or better yet, cyber false flags. Half the shit that&#39;s attributed the China, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised was a false flag tactics. </p>

<p>All of that said.. I always say &quot;<em>I don&#39;t know where these large corporations end and where the federal government begins.</em>&quot; So you might have a point there as well! </p>
