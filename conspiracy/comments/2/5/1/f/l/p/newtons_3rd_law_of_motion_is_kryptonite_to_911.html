<p>Forces always come in pairs. How does this pertain to the demolition of both WTC1 and WTC2? Let&#39;s set up a simple example: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A= top 15 floors of tower</p>

<p>B= bottom 88 floors of tower</p>

<p>Newton&#39;s 3rd law of motion states &quot;in every interaction, there is a pair of forces acting on the two interacting objects. The size of the forces on the first object (A) equals the size of the force on the second object (B).

<p>The logical next step is to find the <em>unaccounted for energy source</em> for the remainder of the collapse sequence. </p>

<p>Gravity can only account for a portion of the energy that brought down either WTC1 or WTC2.
Debunkers will insist that gravity <em>is</em> the unaccounted for energy source. Which brings us back to debunkers ignoring Newton&#39;s 3rd law. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/24xos1/911_truth_for_dummies/chc5cp6">And around and around we go...</a></p>

<p>In other words, the momentum (which equals mass times velocity) of the 12 to 28 stories (WTC 1 and WTC 2, respectively) falling on the supporting structure below (which was designed to support only the static weight of the floors above and not any dynamic effects due to the downward momentum) so greatly exceeded the strength capacity of the structure below that it (the structure below) was unable to stop or even to slow the falling mass. The downward momentum felt by each successive lower floor was even larger due to the increasing mass.  </p>

<p>So physics changes with scale?  I would like to know how physics is different on a smaller scale or larger scale.  You are saying the a smaller scale object cannot be tested in a lab environment, which I provided the plane example.  Now you are saying my theory is untestable until we build a life size scale of the WTC towers.  Nice try.</p>

<p><a href="http://nees.ucla.edu/edumodule.html">Look what I found.</a></p>

<p>Could those be scaled down models of buildings for structural engineering analysis?  You should call the University of UCLA and tell their Engineers that testing building structures on a smaller scale is pointless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea you&#39;re completely misunderstanding how it works.  Buildings aren&#39;t solid masses (especially not the WTC buildings, which were more like flat plates with vertical pencils around the edges and in the center supporting the next level) so in this case gravity adds cumulatively.  You have the entire weight of the floors above pushing on the single floor below, because each floor pushes on each floor above and below it.</p>

<p>This fact is what skyscrapers rely on to survive, that each floor can support the cumulative weight of the floors above it.  However, if you weaken the steel supports on one of those floors (say by either introducing burning jet fuel or letting the fire rage uncontrollably for 6 hours) then suddenly it can&#39;t support its assigned weight.</p>

<p>Seriously, you wanna test this?  Play a game of Jenga.</p>

<p>Since you so helpfully pointed out that small scale tests can be useful to indicate realistic expectations, build a Jenga tower <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Jenga_tower_with_vertical_pieces.JPG">like this</a> using all vertical or horizontal pieces for each level so that there is a massive air gap in the middle like WTC&#39;s design.  Now remove on of the vertical pieces, and you&#39;ll see the whole thing come tumbling down.</p>

<p>Also worth pointing out:  Small scale <em>suggests</em> large scale results.  It doesn&#39;t conclusively prove them.  Namely because of the square cube law (mass volume increases faster than height) while the yield, shear, and ultimate strengths of materials stays the same.  This results in what would normally be a very stable situation (like, say, a jenga tower made of wood) rapidly becoming unfeasibly dangerous (which is why we don&#39;t build skyscrapers out of wood).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for at least trying the experiment at home.   </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Jenga tower you built should have fallen over the second the planes hit them.  The towers were built stronger then that.  The way you built your Jenga tower is suggesting that taking out an upper column weakens the lower mass.  This is not Newton&#39;s third law.   If this holds true, then a Cessna should be able to fly into any tall building and collapse it.  Your Jenga tower is also lacking the central core columns for added support.  Please re-create your Jenga tower with a <a href="http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/0112/Eagar/fig3.gif">strong central core</a>, then test it again.</p>

<p>Edit:  </p>

<p>Every single comment that was against &quot;the official story&quot; is being actively downvoted by <strong>2 downvotes a minute here.</strong>  Just hit refresh.  And the comments here for &quot;the official story&quot; are being upvoted by the same.  They were all winning by a margin of +10 votes yesterday.  This thread is literally on <strong>page 10</strong> of this sub now.  For a post that no one likes, it sure is being downvoted heavily right now.   You can literally click refresh an <strong>any</strong> posts that were against the official story and watch.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/251flp/newtons_3rd_law_of_motion_is_kryptonite_to_911/chcpxkw">This post</a> had -18 points last night.  Now it has +44 and counting this morning? <strong>That&#39;s a 60 point swing overnight on a thread no one likes.</strong>  I guess this is how this sub works.  When the truth get brought to light during the day, it gets buried at night when the USA is sleeping.  Rather convenient.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 3:</strong>  </p>

<p>Why would a thread that was winning last night get heavily downvoted overnight?  It seems like people across the Atlantic and Pacific have more interest in downvoting this story than the American people do.   Pretty weird.  It&#39;s like getting into an argument with some dude from India who is really passionate about making sure the American people don&#39;t question the official story.</p>

<p>The truth will come out one day and downvotes will not be able to stop it.</p>

<p>According to you my Jenga example is completely acceptable.  You&#39;re wrong, because physics is in fact scalar (what with things like F=ma meaning that adding mass with a consistent accelleration results in a superior force and whatnot) but by your own logic my Jenga example disproves you.  So either you&#39;re wrong about physics and your hypothesis is still proven wrong, or you&#39;re wrong about my small scale&#39;s veracity and you&#39;re still proven wrong.  Make up your mind.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY">This guy probably doesn&#39;t know what he was talking about either.....</a></p>

<p>&quot;In the following interview clip, which took place inside of the Twin Towers on January 25, 2001, and aired on the 7th Season of the History Channel&#39;s Series &quot;Modern Marvels&quot; on June 25, 2001, Frank A. DeMartini, Manager, WTC Construction and Project Management, explains how the Twin Towers were &quot;designed&quot; to withstand the impact of a &quot;fully-loaded Boeing 707.&quot; He also goes on to say that each of the Twin Towers would &quot;probably sustain multiple impacts of jetliners because this structure is like the mosquito netting on your screen door: this <strong>intense grid</strong>; and, the jet plane is just a <strong>pencil</strong> puncturing this screen netting; <strong>it really does nothing to the screen netting.</strong>&quot;  <em>-ahem, Newton&#39;s 3rd Law</em></p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the planes that slammed into the Twin Towers were Boeing 767s, which have a maximum take-off weight of 300,000 pounds, slightly less than the 330,000-pound maximum of the Boeing 707, making them slightly smaller than the planes the architects designed the Twin Towers to withstand the impacts of.</p>

<p>Sadly, Frank DeMartini is not available for comment because he perished in the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001.&quot;</p>

<p>What is colloquially called pancaking <em>during</em> the collapse they refer to as <strong>progressive collapse</strong>. Which did happen and they don&#39;t say didn&#39;t - in fact they support that.</p>

<p>Because NIST didn&#39;t study beyond the initiation point, they don&#39;t rule out pancaking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was no violation of Newtons third law.</p>

<p>Here is a simple logic exercise for you.  Remember, according to Newton, Force = Mass * Acceleration</p>

<p>When the uppermost 15 stories of the trade center gave way and started to collapse, the <em>MASS</em> was 15 stories worth, and it <em>ACCELLERATED</em> to around 19mph before hitting the top intact floor of the bottom portion of the structure.</p>

<p>Now, Newton&#39;s third law says forces occur in equal and opposite directions.  The amount of force needed to destroy that first intact floor acts in the opposite direction on the falling mass by slowing it down.  That floor doesn&#39;t have nearly the strength to <em>stop</em> 15 stories worth of falling mass, so it can only slow it down.</p>

<p>Once that floor collapses, you now have a <em>16 story mass</em>, and it has 12 feet of <em>nothing but air</em> to go through before it impacts the second intact floor.  The now <em>16 story pile of mass</em> isn&#39;t starting from 0mph like when the initial 15 stories collapsed.  It&#39;s already moving.  By the time it passes through the 12 feet of air, it is now going <em>faster</em> than the initial 15 story pile was.</p>

<p>So, knowing that <strong>Force = Mass * Acceleration</strong>, what do you think happens as that mass goes through floor by floor?  It GAINS MASS with every floor it collapses, and it <em>ACCELERATES</em> every time it passes through the 12 feet of air between floors.  The amount of <em>FORCE</em> that pile of mass possesses <em>INCREASES</em> as it falls.</p>

<p>There is NO violation of Newton&#39;s third law.  The energy required to pulverize and collapse each story of the building acts in the opposite direction by slowing the pile down.  The problem is that the trade center is not a tower of bricks.  It&#39;s a mostly hollow tube, made up of 88% air which provides no resistance at all.  Any energy expended in slowing the pile of falling mass down is irrelevant, since the pile gets to fall 12 feet unimpeded between each floor and <em>GAIN VELOCITY</em> as it falls.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The upper falling section of WTC 1, while it was still identifiable and observable, (before it turned into a dust cloud) was measured and it did not slow down, it accelerated uniformly</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False.  The structure did not collapse at free fall acceleration, it was 8 or 9 seconds slower, indicating it was meeting resistance and slowing down between floors.  Not nearly enough to arrest the collapse, but enough to safely say the building was providing resistance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s also that little thing called the core of the building with 47 HUGE steel columns, that&#39;s not air every 12 feet. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the buildings collapsed, portions of the core columns remained standing for 15 seconds for both towers.  40 floors for one tower and 60 floors for another IIRC.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lots of mass was immediately set outside the perimeter of the tower, or square, if you will and that mass is no longer acting up the rest of the building, it&#39;s falling through the air.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The majority of the mass remained in the collapse zone.  You&#39;re nitpicking, the fact is that the mass of rubble was <em>increasing</em> as the building collapsed.  Who gives a shit if it isn&#39;t adding an entire floor worth of mass for each one it collapses, it&#39;s still adding a shitload of weight as it falls.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you believe the upper block crushed everything below if then why is there perfectly straight columns showing in the core for a few seconds when most of WTC 1 was on the ground?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the core columns offered more resistance than the empty floor space did, therefore they remained standing for a few seconds.  All of the empty floor space around them collapsed without much resistance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The great majority of the mass of those buildings turned into powder in midair</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No they didn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Nowhere did I say that it fell at free fall, only that it accelerated uniformly. If it accelerates uniformly and doesn&#39;t slow down, it&#39;s not impacting what&#39;s below, something&#39;s removing it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t understand the concept you are talking about, and it shows.</p>

<p>The estimate was that the first floor impacted would have slowed the mass down by around half a mile an hour.  Each subsequent floor would have slowed it down even less than that due to the pile of rubble having increased in mass and velocity.  You can&#39;t see 99% of what&#39;s happening in the trade tower collapses.  All you can see is what&#39;s happening to the outer shell.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mentioned portions of the core still standing, and that that fact gives your piledriver theory a MAJOR problem, why didn&#39;t this unstoppable force you speak of crush it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The core columns remained standing because they were essentially a hollow tube in the center of the building.  The massive empty floor space around the core columns was subject to the full force of the rubble bearing down and collapsed almost immediately.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Both of the towers dispersed in a hugh circular fashion and blossomed dramatically into gigantic plumes of dust.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What did you expect them to do?  The buildings contained a massive amount of cement and drywall, which tends to turn <em>partially</em> to dust when it gets crushed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzGJs-uyaSY">Here</a> is a building tipping over in India.  It certainly isn&#39;t demolished, yet it creates a &quot;gigantic plume of dust&quot; when it falls.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr18PYagUIo">Here</a> is another.  Again, a &quot;gigantic plume of dust&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Uh, yeah, there was a ridiculous amount of material in weight missing on the ground.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, there wasn&#39;t...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>780,000 metric tons of concrete in those towers, where did this concrete go?…... That&#39;s right, it was pulverized in mid air and was all over lower manhattan like snow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Concrete turns partially to dust when it is pulverized.  This is not news to anyone with any knowledge at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look at the seismic readings from the Kingdome implosion and compare them to the towers, then compare the weights of these different structures. What&#39;s missing there?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Sigh</em>...</p>

<p>The Kingdome was demolished from the bottom up.  The trade towers collapsed from the top down.  Do the math.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, but you&#39;re way off here. We aren&#39;t talking about the structure being strong enough to support the upper 15 floors. We are talking about whether the structure is strong enough to support the impact load from the upper 15 floors falling 12 feet, which is totally different. As calculated by bazant and Zhou,  the impact force is an order of magnitude greater than what the structure can actually support.</p>

<p>Secondly, you&#39;re not understanding properly how a structure supports load. Having more floors doesn&#39;t make the structure any stronger. The columns in this case only fail one or two floors at a time, so this building could have been two hundred stories tall and you would have the same outcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you&#39;re having trouble understanding this &quot;gravity&quot; thing. Let&#39;s learn some basic physics.</p>

<p>Force = Mass x Acceleration</p>

<p>Noting this, and noting that gravity is a source of acceleration (with no air resistance, mass will accelerate at roughly 9.8 meter per second downwards due to gravity...air resistance is negligible at this point), we have to consider two things:</p>

<p>1) The force acting downward must increase as the mass increases, because greater mass is hitting the floors below...even if debris falls out to the sides, it&#39;s not likely to <em>reduce</em> the above mass.</p>

<p>2) The force acting downward must increase, or at least remain roughly constant, because gravity is accelerating the mass as it falls.</p>

<p>Now, keeping this in mind, let me give you an example. A flat piece of wood falls 10 meters, hitting a flat piece of wood below it (both weigh 1 kg). In order to dislodge the lower flat piece of wood, the upper piece has to hit it with a force of at least 5 Newtons (measure of force). The upper one hits the lower one with a force of 9.8 m/s * 1kg, 9.8 Newtons. It dislodges and falls with the second piece of wood into the next one. Now, the force is no longer 9.8m/s * 1kg, because there&#39;s <em>two</em> pieces of wood. Now, they hit with 9.8m/s * <strong>2</strong>kg, increasing the downward force.</p>

<p>You still following here? Cool. Now let&#39;s look at the energy side of this, because that&#39;s another way to calculate this all. Kinetic energy is calculated by 1/2 * mass * velocity squared. Or we can do this with potential energy, which is mass * gravity (acceleration) * height. Note, by the way, that they both illustrate exactly what is being said above. Each time a floor falls, the same height (roughly, I mean it&#39;s not <em>perfect</em> engineering) is traveled before they hit the next one. However, there is <em>more</em> mass coming down. That means <em>more energy</em>. And in both formulas that means <em>more</em> energy. And because the velocity in the first formula would be roughly the same (since the acceleration downwards is constant due to gravity, and they go the same distance down while accelerating), there&#39;s <em>no reason</em> to think they would <em>lose</em> energy as they go down. In fact, they should be falling <em>faster</em>!</p>

<p>Think of it this way, if you don&#39;t like the above examples/explanations. You fall off a building, let&#39;s say. You are going to fall through a few canvases as you go. You&#39;ll slow down, right? Because your mass remains constant, but friction slows you down (we&#39;re assuming your legs don&#39;t break). This time, we drop a bulldozer down. The canvases have very little effect, right? Because it&#39;s got so much more mass, it has <em>tons</em> more potential energy, and hits with much more force! Now let&#39;s say we drop a bulldozer which latches on to another bulldozer, resting on a canvas. Does the fact that it hit another bulldozer slow it down? Nope, because now they&#39;re falling <em>together</em>. When they both hit, there will be double the force, because there&#39;s double the mass. Sure, <em>some small amount of energy is lost</em> when they collide because this isn&#39;t a perfect world, and the top bulldozer probably bounces every so slightly upward. But in the case of the falling building, each floor falls only for the slightest fraction of a second, before coming down thunderously on top of another floor that has already exerted its force, and probably hasn&#39;t had time to rebound itself.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very, very basic physics. The more mass is falling, the more force it&#39;ll exert when it hits what&#39;s below.</p>

<p>You can look up the NIST findings if you want - I did and it says that the center structure was compromised by fire and the damn thing fell.<br/>
Whether you call it &quot;pancaking&quot; or whatever, the result is the same - the building fell down because it was hit by a big plane full of fuel, it caught fire and burned until it became structurally unsound enough to fall.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, the NIST had this to say about the collapse of WTC 1 and 2.</p>

<p>&quot;Based on its comprehensive investigation, NIST concluded that the WTC towers collapsed because: </p>

<p>(1) the impact of the planes severed and damaged support columns, dislodged fireproofing insulation coating the steel floor trusses and steel columns, and widely dispersed jet fuel over multiple floors; and </p>

<p>(2) the subsequent unusually large number of jet-fuel ignited multi-floor fires (which reached temperatures as high as 1,000 degrees Celsius, or 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit) significantly weakened the floors and columns with dislodged fireproofing to the point where floors sagged and pulled inward on the perimeter columns. This led to the inward bowing of the perimeter columns and failure of the south face of WTC 1 and the east face of WTC 2, initiating the collapse of each of the towers. Both photographic and video evidence—as well as accounts from the New York City Police Department aviation unit during a half-hour period prior to collapse—support this sequence for each tower.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t see the reason for the in your own words comment but to each his own. The reason I think this is simple a plane hit the uper part of each building at close to full speed and at somewhat of an angle(not directly head on). When th impact happend it twisted the whole building, not much but more than it was disigned to in the wind. This would cause damage through the whole building not just the floors impacted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it wasn&#39;t designed to take an impact like it did though. Near full speed and a larger plane than it was designed for. It makes zero sense to think a building getting hit by a plane, even if designed for such an impact, wouldn&#39;t take other damage to the structure. Being built to withstand doesn&#39;t mean it wouldn&#39;t take damage just that it would still be standing to let people evacuate. They would still have to go in and fix said damage or bring it down in CD because it can&#39;t be fixed.</p>

<p>A= top 15 floors of tower</p>

<p>B= bottom 88 floors of tower</p>

<p>Newton&#39;s 3rd law of motion states &quot;in every interaction, there is a pair of forces acting on the two interacting objects. The size of the forces on the first object (A) equals the size of the force on the second object (B). The direction of the force on the first object (A)is opposite to the direction of the force on the second object (B). <strong>Forces always come in pairs</strong> - equal and opposite action-reaction force pairs.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey Look at that.  Two whole subs who downvote brigaded this whole thread.  Classy.</p>

<p>Your Jenga tower is wrong.  It has no central core columns.  That is why it will fall over.</p>

<p><em>&quot;See this flimsy tower I built, it falls over.  It is the same as the WTC towers....&quot;</em></p>

<p>Seriously, you should call the University of UCLA Engineers and give them your Jenga example.  The first thing they will tell you is that your Jenga tower has no central core columns.  </p>

<p>Edit:  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY">This guy probably doesn&#39;t know what he was talking about either.....</a></p>

<p>&quot;In the following interview clip, which took place inside of the Twin Towers on January 25, 2001, and aired on the 7th Season of the History Channel&#39;s Series &quot;Modern Marvels&quot; on June 25, 2001, Frank A. DeMartini, Manager, WTC Construction and Project Management, explains how the Twin Towers were &quot;designed&quot; to withstand the impact of a &quot;fully-loaded Boeing 707.&quot; He also goes on to say that each of the Twin Towers would &quot;probably sustain multiple impacts of jetliners because this structure is like the mosquito netting on your screen door: this <strong>intense grid</strong>; and, the jet plane is just a <strong>pencil</strong> puncturing this screen netting; <strong>it really does nothing to the screen netting.</strong>&quot;  <em>-ahem, Newton&#39;s 3rd Law</em></p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the planes that slammed into the Twin Towers were Boeing 767s, which have a maximum take-off weight of 300,000 pounds, slightly less than the 330,000-pound maximum of the Boeing 707, making them slightly smaller than the planes the architects designed the Twin Towers to withstand the impacts of.</p>

<p>Sadly, Frank DeMartini is not available for comment because he perished in the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001.&quot;</p>

<p>When the structural integrity of a floor changes (which could happen because, oh I don&#39;t know, a plane filled with fuel flew into it and burst into flames heating the metal construction) , it will fail and the upper floors will start to move downwards. When they impact the floor below the one that has just failed, a force will be exerted on them.</p>

<p>Newton&#39;s 3<sup>rd</sup> Law is all well and good but all three laws should be taken into account as they are a homogenous set</p>

<p>In the following example I&#39;m going to be using some actual physics calculations here (Potential Energy formula - <em>P=mgh</em>). If you disagree with them then can I suggest you publish your amended formulae and await your Nobel prize?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll keep the numbers simple so that we can all understand</p>

<p>Imagine a column (built in a similar fashion to WTC 1+2 and not a Jenga pile) that is 100 levels tall. Each level weighs a metric tonne and is a metre high.</p>

<p>Now imagine that the structural integrity of level 80 is compromised and fails. In an instant, there is a mass 21 tonnes (21000 kg) in free fall. After falling for 1m, this mass impacts onto level 79 with a kinetic energy of 205.8kJ. Not all energy is conserved as it will be converted into heat, noise etc but it <em>will</em> affect the integrity of level 79 and the end result is the failure of level 79 pretty quickly.</p>

<p>We now have a mass of 22 tonnes falling and impacting level 78. Even if we imagine the mass had come to a complete top and a free-fall of only 1m occurs, 78 would encounter an impact producing 215.6kJ. However, I would imagine that levels 79 to 100 would not stop completely free-falling and so the energy would be higher. Again, some energy will be converted into heat, affect level 78 and fall again. Repeat until levels 2-80 have failed</p>

<p>By the time levels 2-100 have collapsed, even if they only impacted level 1 as if they free-fell 1m, the energy produced would be 1455.3kJ. Once floor 1 collapses, levels 2-99 are still falling. Once the mass of levels 2-80 is at ground level, levels 81-100 would the give way due to the shockwave going back up through the tower.</p>

<p>Each floor is only designed to support (repel) the energy produced by mass bearing down on it (with some tolerance). This energy is dispersed into the surrounding structure. When half the structure of a few floors has been removed (by, possibly, a place flying into it and exploding), the energy is forced into the remaining structure and the remaining tolerance is lowered. The kinetic energy of a mass falling onto it (<em>K=0.5mv<sup>2</sup></em>) means that that tolerance is exceeded and a failure is an almost certainty.</p>

<p>And the bit about putting a bowling ball on top of a model Empire State Building and it not falling? Seriously? What if you remove a load-bearing beam of the model (which I would guess <em>did</em> happen at WTC 1+2 because, hmm, let&#39;s think...a plane flying into it?). Would you expect the bowling ball to still be supported? I&#39;m guessing no</p>

<p>What. The. Hell? You&#39;re saying that the state of top 15 floors is going to change (<em>i.e.</em> move downwards) because the lower 88 floors aren&#39;t changing state? What does that even mean? Are you agreeing with me or disagreeing?</p>

I&#39;m surprised I haven&#39;t been called a shill yet but I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s only a matter of time.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not debunking anything. I&#39;m pointing out that you&#39;ve taken a well known and accepted set of law of motion, ignored the bits that don&#39;t fit your theory, warped the rest of it and come up with something that wouldn&#39;t look out of place in a sci-fi novel (albeit a terrible one).</p>

<p>Who mentioned a pancake theory? Not me. I&#39;m talking about Newton&#39;s 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> law of motion and the way you handily ignored the 1<sup>st</sup></p>

<p>The way you&#39;re describing Newtown&#39;s 1<sup>st</sup> law suggests you could remove a floor completely and anything above it would stay floating in the air as &quot;<em>they keep doing what they&#39;re doing</em>&quot;</p>

<p>Whist ignoring Newton&#39;s other laws of motion</p>

<p>I&#39;m someone who actually understands basic high-school physics, can perform basic energy calculations and doesn&#39;t cherry pick facts to suit a theory. Also, I&#39;m not saying anything about a pancake collapse. I&#39;m saying that you ignored Newton&#39;s 1<sup>st</sup> law whereby a force will affect bodies at rest. Gravity is a pretty big force. If you don&#39;t believe me, why haven&#39;t you jumped out of a building and gone flying yet?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm I actually do a physics degree so I&#39;ll try my best to explain how this works.</p>

<p>Consider the building in its equilibrium state. The top block floors exert a force vector W on the floor beneath it. This floor exerts a reaction force N back on the top floors. There is no net force on the top floors. The building does not collapse.</p>

<p>Now consider the damaged building. Suddenly the reaction force N is less than W much like how a jenga tower with no bottom block no longer has the reaction force of the table to stop it falling. There still is an equal and opposite reaction but it is the building pulling the earth towards it.</p>

<p>Since W &gt; N the floor has an acceleration, picks up momentum, impacts the next floor, exerts a large impulse, causes the collapse of the next floor etc.</p>

<p>The way you&#39;re phrasing it you would wonder how any object can ever fall.</p>

<li><p>I push down (exert a force) onto a key and it moves <em>(Newton&#39;s 1<sup>st</sup> law)</em></p></li>
<li><p>It moves down in the direction I push at a velocity proportional to that of my finger <em>(Newton&#39;s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law)</em></p></li>

<p>According to your interpretation of Newton&#39;s 3<sup>rd</sup> law though, I shouldn&#39;t be able to make the keys move at all because however hard I push there will always be an opposite force pushing back against my finger</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry to bump in here but just to clarify for the arguments sake.</p>

<p>There is an opposite equal force pushing against your finger it&#39;s just that the Force = M*a and since your mass is so much larger than the key you experience a neglible acceleration most likely cancelled out by friction forces. The key experiences the force of your finger and without a reaction force beneath it experiences a much greater acceleration and hence velocity due to its small mass. </p>

<p>But you know what? I&#39;m through with people like you who see a phrase in a high-school book, ignore the actual science behind it and use it (incorrectly) as the basis for a whole theory. And then, when people eminently more qualified than yourself come along and say &quot;You&#39;re talking rubbish&quot; you just say &quot;You&#39;re a classic debunker! You&#39;re a fool! I&#39;m the one you should all be listening to&quot;. You can&#39;t get it into your head that someone may actually know more than you about a subject (in this case, physics)</p>

<p>Tell me, what&#39;s your qualifications regarding physics? Degree? Masters? Doctorate? Professor? Or is it, as I suspect, 1st grade high-school?</p>

<p>There are people on here with degrees. There are people on here with years of engineering experience. There are people with a basic understanding of energy, force and the conservation thereof. They all have something in common - they all know you&#39;re wrong. Actually, let me correct that - they all know you&#39;re <strong>very</strong> wrong</p>

<p>Finally, tell me (without referring to penty1&#39;s explanation of force) how you believe it is possible for me to push a key on my  keyboard without violating your version of Newton&#39;s 3<sup>rd</sup> law. I need a good laugh</p>

<p>A= top 15 floors of tower</p>

<p>Newton&#39;s 3rd law of motion states &quot;in every interaction, there is a pair of forces acting on the two interacting objects. The size of the forces on the first object (A) equals the size of the force on the second object (B).

Forces always come in pairs - equal and opposite action-reaction force pairs.&quot;
The logical next step is to find the unaccounted for energy source for the remainder of the collapse sequence.
Gravity can only account for a portion of the energy that brought down either WTC1 or WTC2. Debunkers will insist that gravity is the unaccounted for energy source. Which brings us back to debunkers ignoring Newton&#39;s 3rd law.</p>

<p>Further, you can see that portions of Part A remain standing after the collapse zone has passed well below them.

<p>All of the mass that was ejected horizontally out of play and all of the mass that remained standing above the progressing collapse zone represent undeniable error in Bazant&#39;s equations.

<p>Sure, and that&#39;s mostly correct as this part: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>if it weren&#39;t already obvious, some of the mass of Part A and/or Part C is ejected horizontally out of play and cannot be part of the mass that is crushing Part A</p>

<p>.. accounts for minimal mass. The dust is 200 micron sized particles being ejected as a cloud. The cloud has minimal mass and therefore is both a minimal loss of mass and a minimal loss of energy. </p>

<p>The top 15 floors would have to lose <em>most</em> of its mass to not collapse lower floors. It was <strong>adding</strong> much <em>more</em> mass as it collapsed than was ejected in the dust clouds. So basically - this is not just a <em>terrible</em> objection to that paper, it&#39;s one that makes even less sense than your original assertion. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Your debunking is terrible and lacks any actual.. you know.. mathematics, physical models, or even anything other than <em>base assertion</em>. Not to mention it basically makes some fundamentally poor assumptions (about the mass of the clouds and ejecta).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you that dense? <strong>You quoted part of it that does it</strong>!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In other words, as long as the falling block is accelerating downward we have the counter-intuitive result that the force it exerts on the lower section of the building is significantly less than its static weight. It is difficult to imagine how an upper block exerting a force of only 36% of its static weight could crush the larger, stronger, undamaged lower section of the building to the ground, when the building, at any level, was designed to support several times the weight above it. Assuming a safety factor of between 3 and 5 [12], the observed acceleration implies that close to 90% of the strength of the lower section of the building must have been eliminated by forces other than the supposed &quot;pile driver,&quot; suggesting that some sort of controlled demolition was at work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>None of that is true <em>unless the entire lower 88 are modeled as a solid mass</em>. The percentages specifically doing that. That is in fact what the whole &quot;pile driver&quot; phrase means. It is specifically treating the &quot;larger, stronger, undamaged lower section of the building&quot; as being modeled as a solid object for the purposes of their mathematics - else none of the rest of it&#39;s work makes even the most remote of sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice try OP, physics actually does support why the towers collapsed and not this mumbo-jumbo. Say the 88th floor burnt and allowed the 15 floors above it to collapse, these upper 15 floors then pulverized the remains of the 88th and then went on to the 87th, 86th and so on. All the upper part of the tower needed to do was crush the floor below it, the increasing velocity and added mass as the floors collapsed allowed the destruction to continue and utterly destroy both towers.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t buy that, here&#39;s the equation for kinetic energy: KE=.5mv<sup>2</sup> As you can see as the mass and velocity increase the kinetic energy increases, none of the floors were built to withstand thousands of tons of material falling on them at a few hundred miles an hour.</p>

<p>As for Newton&#39;s 3rd Law, it&#39;s only applicable in the case you used it when the towers weren&#39;t collapsing, once the collapse started velocity came into play (see above) and the equal and opposing forces of the 88 lower floors pushing up and the 15 upper floors pushing down became unequal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, there is no equal and opposite reaction from the lower floors, the normal force from the bottom is no longer equal to the force of gravity from the top. Newton&#39;s third law doesn&#39;t work the way you&#39;re trying to make it, once the upper 15 floors start on the way down gravity accelerates them 9.8 meters per second every second which gives more than enough kinetic energy to pulverize floor after successive floor. Unless you think that a floor made of mostly empty space, dry wall partitions, concrete and a relatively light exterior with some tube framing can support itself as well as another 15 of itself stacked on top after being subjected to a fire burning at up to 4000 degrees F, but nobody&#39;s that stupid are they?</p>

<p>As for the steel beams, beams like those aren&#39;t designed to stand on their own, once the support provided by the exterior walls and tower was gone the beams would fall too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, this is where you are completely wrong.</p>

<p>You assume the the bottom 88 floors would slow down the acceleration and stop collapse, but you can&#39;t know that without a detailed analysis.</p>

<p>You have to look at two things, energy input and energy output. In this case, the energy input is the gravitational potential energy of the structure, which is continually released in the form of kinetic energy as the building falls. This means, you have a continuous input of energy for as long as the building is falling. I believe this is your missing energy that you mentioned.</p>

<p>The energy output is caused by the crushing of the structure. It dissipates the kinetic energy by transferring it into strain energy. </p>

<p>Now, as is probably intuitive, if kinetic energy is being input into the system by gravity faster than it is being removed by the crushing of the structure, than the collapse with progress all the way to the ground. If not, than it slows down and stops. </p>

<p>Really, the issue is much more complicated than you think and you need to prove that energy output was greater than energy input before you can actually prove that collapse was impossible. So I&#39;ll just wait patiently for your next post where you do those calcs.</p>

<p>You do not have a continuous input of energy because the bottom 88 floors with the 47 core columns and the steel outer frames would have pushed with equal and OPPOSITE force against the top 15. </p>

<p>It&#39;s Newton&#39;s 3rd law. The bottom 88 floors will push with the equal and opposite force as the top 15. It&#39;s physics 101.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow! I just understood what you are saying. I kept thinking that I was missing something, but now I realize that you just lack the most basic understanding of Newtons laws.</p>

<p>You think that because the bottom part of the tower pushes back with an equal and opposite force that these two forces cancel each other out and that no collapse can happen. That must be what you think because that&#39;s the only thing that makes sense. Let me describe how ridiculous that is with another example.</p>

<p>So, I have an egg and a brick. I put the egg on the ground and drop the brick on top of it. What happens? </p>

<p>Well, according to your interpretation of Newtons 3rd law, that egg pushes back with an equal and opposite force to what the brick impacts it with. Therefore these forces cancel each other out and the brick comes to a nice rest on top of the egg. And don&#39;t you dare ignore Newtons 3rd law and tell me that egg gets crushed!!</p>

<p>But seriously, I hope you see that you are wrong now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK,  answer this one question since you haven&#39;t bade it clear.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right that the bottom floors push on the top floors with an equal and opposite force. So why does that mean that the force that&#39;s applied is not enough to crush the bottom part of the building.</p>

<p>When I push on a door it pushes back with an equal and opposite force, that doesn&#39;t mean I cant close a door though...</p>

<p>It <em>tilted</em> yes, but it didn&#39;t fall to the side - the momentum and force was still downwards not sideways. </p>

<p>All the force needs to be is enough to cause the next floor to fail. That&#39;s it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This a really great way to approach it.  You can&#39;t debunk physics.  Try to visualize the towers as a stack of bricks.  Whatever happens(plane crashing into) on the upper mass of the bricks, cannot effect the lower part.   So even if the upper mass is on fire, it cannot crush its way all the way to the bottom bricks without adding <strong>energy</strong> to the system.  Newton&#39;s third law prevents this.  People can recreate this experiment all the want in their backyards.  Take 10 bricks, then take the top 2.  Then try dropping the 2 onto the bottom 8 bricks.  Do they crush their way alll the way to the bottom at free-fall speed?  Nope.  Good post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But there is energy. Its called gravitational potential energy (U(potential)=mass x acceleration due to gravity x height) , and once motion begins it becomes kinetic (T(Kinetic energy= .5 mass *velocity <sup>2).</sup> Once its kinetic, its not just about forces, its about momentum (mass x velocity) and impulse, and conservation of said momentum. </p>

<p>The brick analogy is both wrong and right at the same time. If you put a scale on the bottom, you would notice a change in impulse because of a transference of force because its a full rigid body (the same way newton&#39;s cradle works).  A tower that is mostly hollow is not a rigid body in the same way and if the forces aren&#39;t aligned right on the supports it would lead to collapse. Instead of clay bricks, pretend it was a jenga set after people have been playing a while. Now what happens when you drop those bricks hard on the top?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All large buildings are designed to implode during a controlled demolition. This makes them safer and easier to bring down when they&#39;ve outlived their usefulness. You can search YouTube and find numerous videos of this in action, most especially with some old Las Vegas hotels.</p>

<p>Because large buildings are designed to implode during controlled demolition, it seems to me (would be interesting for physicists and architects to confirm) that they would be more likely to implode in the same manner due to other traumas they might suffer.</p>

<p>The way the towers fell coupled with the fact they were designed to implode at the end of their lives doesn&#39;t necessarily indicate it was controlled demolition on 9/11. Nor does it indicate that it was not.</p>

<p>It simply means that they were designed in such a way that you cannot possibly design your stack-of-bricks experiment so the stack-of-bricks experiment is irrelevant to the discussion.</p>

<p>What might be interesting would be to find a skyscraper that has outlived its usefulness that was built in roughly the same manner and at roughly the same time as the WTC, then fully load a big, remote controlled jet with jet fuel and fly that fucker into high floors and see what happens.</p>

<p>To me the leap of logic that if a building is designed to fall into itself <em>during a controlled demolition</em> then it must fall that way from random damage makes no sense.
If it&#39;s true that they are intended to fall this way during a controlled demolition then what happened on 9/11 looks like a controlled demolition to me.</p>

<p>Unless you can back the statement that they would fall this way from random damage with some proof I think what you&#39;re saying actually supports the idea that the buildings were demo&#39;d that day.</p>

<p>After all, demoing a building is a huge undertaking. If buildings are just deisgned to fall that way from random damage why is building demolition such an exact science?</p>

<p>The word you&#39;re getting hung up on is &quot;must&quot;. Might. Could. Plausible.</p>

<p>why is building demolition such an exact science?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To avoid the collateral damage that the WTC falling caused, for one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what happened on 9/11 looks like a controlled demolition to me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, the buildings falling look a lot like what would have happened during a controlled demolition. And controlled demolition could be a plausible explanation for what happened.</p>

<p>Equally plausible is that the impact of a 395,000 pound jet traveling at hundreds of miles per hour combined with a fire burning jet fuel weakened the structure on one floor enough that it could no longer support the combined weight of all the floors on top if it, and that one floor collapsed.  When that one floor collapsed, all that weight and energy hit the next floor down, which did a perfectly fine job of holding all the floors on top of it, but couldn&#39;t with the added energy of them under free fall, so it collapsed. And so on, like dominoes, straight down.</p>

<p>The experiment I proposed would be interesting. If we could see just one other building designed in a similar way and built with similar materials at roughly the same time as the WTC take a jet full of fuel to its top floors, we&#39;d know.</p>

<p>But to my knowledge the only time it has ever happened (with a jet / jet fuel) was WTC.</p>

<p>I&#39;m on the &quot;jury&#39;s still out&quot; side on 9/11. I feel it&#39;s plausible that TPTB were up to no good, to a greater or lesser degree. I think it&#39;s far more likely that the conspiracy was to get the terrorists to attack and leave it at that than to go to the full lengths of a controlled demolition on the towers. The latter wouldn&#39;t be needed to achieve the desired result - a new war to fill the pockets of the wealthy / military-industrial complex.</p>

<p>Physics is physics.  The forces involved are the same regardless of the scale.  </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/yUz8OBn">Take this Empire State Building Erector Set instead of bricks</a>.   </p>

<p>Light the upper 20% on fire with lighter fluid.  Does the steel frame below allow for the part on fire to crush its way to the ground?  No.  The forces are the same.  You can even attach a bowling ball on-top of the structure.  Light the upper 20% on fire again.  Does the bowling ball crush its way to the bottom?  No.  If anything, the forces on the bottom 80% would deflect the bowling ball off the to side.  It would NEVER fall at free-fall speed straight down with the 80% lower forces in place.</p>

<p>So physics changes with scale?  I would like to know how physics is different on a smaller scale or larger scale.  You are saying the a smaller scale object cannot be tested in a lab environment, which I provided the plane example.  Now you are saying my theory is untestable until we build a life size scale of the WTC towers.  Nice try.</p>

<p><a href="http://nees.ucla.edu/edumodule.html">Look what I found.</a></p>

<p>Could those be scaled down models of buildings for structural engineering analysis?  You should call the University of UCLA and tell their Engineers that testing building structures on a smaller scale is pointless.</p>

<p>The upper falling section of WTC 1, while it was still identifiable and observable, (before it turned into a dust cloud) was measured and it did not slow down, it accelerated uniformly</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False.  The structure did not collapse at free fall acceleration, it was 8 or 9 seconds slower, indicating it was meeting resistance and slowing down between floors.  Not nearly enough to arrest the collapse, but enough to safely say the building was providing resistance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s also that little thing called the core of the building with 47 HUGE steel columns, that&#39;s not air every 12 feet. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the buildings collapsed, portions of the core columns remained standing for 15 seconds for both towers.  40 floors for one tower and 60 floors for another IIRC.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lots of mass was immediately set outside the perimeter of the tower, or square, if you will and that mass is no longer acting up the rest of the building, it&#39;s falling through the air.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The majority of the mass remained in the collapse zone.  You&#39;re nitpicking, the fact is that the mass of rubble was <em>increasing</em> as the building collapsed.  Who gives a shit if it isn&#39;t adding an entire floor worth of mass for each one it collapses, it&#39;s still adding a shitload of weight as it falls.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you believe the upper block crushed everything below if then why is there perfectly straight columns showing in the core for a few seconds when most of WTC 1 was on the ground?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the core columns offered more resistance than the empty floor space did, therefore they remained standing for a few seconds.  All of the empty floor space around them collapsed without much resistance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The great majority of the mass of those buildings turned into powder in midair</p>

<p>No they didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Forces always come in pairs. How does this pertain to the demolition of both WTC1 and WTC2? Let&#39;s set up a simple example:</p>

<p>A= top 15 floors of tower</p>

<p>B= bottom 88 floors of tower</p>

<p>Newton&#39;s 3rd law of motion states &quot;in every interaction, there is a pair of forces acting on the two interacting objects. The size of the forces on the first object (A) equals the size of the force on the second object (B). The direction of the force on the first object (A)is opposite to the direction of the force on the second object (B). Forces always come in pairs - equal and opposite action-reaction force pairs.&quot; The logical next step is to find the unaccounted for energy source for the remainder of the collapse sequence. Gravity can only account for a portion of the energy that brought down either WTC1 or WTC2. Debunkers will insist that gravity is the unaccounted for energy source. Which brings us back to debunkers ignoring Newton&#39;s 3rd law.</p>
