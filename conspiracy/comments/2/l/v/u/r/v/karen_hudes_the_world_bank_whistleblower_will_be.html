<p>I strongly urge you to reconsider. I&#39;m sure we will have a great deal of meaningful questions to ask you, and I for one would be deeply disappointed to see this one go due to a misunderstanding.</p>

<p>In my opinion this subreddit, in terms of moderation has a far better reputation for it&#39;s lack of censorship than any of the ones that had blatantly removed your posts (like <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>) . This is the perfect place to hold your AMA.</p>

<p>Please reconsider the cancellation Karen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Karen, </p>

<p>Our apologies; we were under the impression that what you sent along via email was what you were planning to use for the text of the actual AMA thread due to your syntax (as you titled the document &quot;I am Karen Hudes, AMA&quot;). </p>

<p>Just so users can be aware of how the miscommunication occurred; this is what Karen had sent along to us;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Occupy Wall Street says “Hudes’ story is easily the most interesting, compared to major financial scandals, surveillance, etc. The American public, indeed the whole world, would unify with an understanding of a rigged world for a few.”  I worked in the World Bank’s Legal  Department for 21 years, and reported a cover-up of corruption up the corporate ladder to the  World Bank’s Audit Committee, to the US Treasury Department, to the US Congress, and then  to 188 member countries of the Bretton Woods institutions.  Most Americans are unaware that  the US remained a British colony, subject along with the UK to Rome.  The UK and the City of London have been subservient to the Vatican ever since the Concession of May 15,  1213. <a href="http://anationbeguiled.com/?p=1277">http://anationbeguiled.com/?p=1277</a>  (trust me and ignore the fake warning)</p>

<p>The 188 Foreign Ministers on the World Bank&#39;s Board of Governors reinstated me, and then  appointed me to safeguard the world&#39;s wealth, put in a trust fund for the benefit of humanity at  the end of WWII.  I have called out the US military for illegal transports of this gold.  </p>

<p>You may have seen me at <a href="http://kahudes.net/">http://kahudes.net/</a> or followed me <a href="https://twitter.com/KarenHudes">https://twitter.com/KarenHudes</a> or </p>

<p>I&#39;ll be here from 11:00 AM Eastern to 2:00 PM Eastern on Thursday, November 13, 2014.</p>

<p>The post you commented on here  is simply the introduction. We are absolutely happy to add in the line from your correspondence. Our apologies for the miscommunication and we hope you will reconsider. </p>

<p>This is <em>just</em> the introduction. There was simply a miscommunication.</p>

<p>We thought <em>you</em> were going to include that text in your actual AMA announcement on Thursday.</p>

<p>This thread was supposed to be a heads up for the actual event.</p>

<p>If we really were &quot;censoring&quot; you, why would we make such a big deal about how you <em>aren&#39;t</em> going to be censored here???</p>

<p>We also reached out to our next ama guest after another user brought his interest to our attention via the modmail (but we&#39;ll hold off on that announcement until next week).</p>

<p>We used a thread of comments regarding requested AMA&#39;s to begin reaching out to folks, and if any user wishes to compile another list I will happily continue to reach out.</p>

<p>Two names that we&#39;re working on, but have proven difficult with which to establish contact, are Abby Martin and Amber Lyon. Ms. Lyon is traveling doing research on plants and Ms. Martin does not have any public contact information (but we&#39;re trying back channels). </p>

<p>FTA: Neil Keenan</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Soon after being fired by the World Bank, Karen “the-bouncing-ball” Hudes was claiming there was no gold in Asia, which was in complete contradiction to her earlier claims that the Dragon Family owned eighty percent or more of the World Bank assets.  Furthermore, she stated that she never worked with me when, in fact, not only did she request my assistance with the Dragon Family, I also introduced her to some of my associates, including Count Albert. Having been barred from entry by World Bank security after her dismissal, the Dragon Family was going to get those doors reopened for her. Instead, she brazenly went behind my back with the Family and attempted to cut me out. After that, the Dragon Family would have nothing to do with Karen Hudes, and the World Bank doors remain barred to her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to come off as abrasive, it&#39;s just that Neil Keenan puts up about as much hard evidence to back up his claims as Hudes does, which is about zero. If you look it up, Neil was first mentioned by David Wilcock in his &quot;Trillion dollar lawsuit to end financial tyranny&quot; series. Wilcock said that Keenan was the master mind behind the take down effort but he could never have his identity revealed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, yeah I read it the day she posted it.  More people talking about people, big deal.  Show me someone actually doing something and I&#39;ll be more impressed. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to be rude, but I&#39;m getting real tired of people talking about this feud between Jean and Neal.</p>

<p>Remind me again which one was trusted by the family to broker the certificates that Dal Bosco stole?  Which one filed the lawsuit?  And is trusted by and working with the actual depositors of the accounts, and many of the holders too.  And the elders who are not acting proper, who continues to make their names and accounts public?  I think the number is 24 outed so far. Who was there in Jakarta with Nelu while he was wrongfully imprisoned for the last couple years and worked tirelessly to get him freed. Who&#39;s got the contacts, the black book, the original Hilton Green Accord?  Who&#39;s been nearly assassinated a half dozen times just these last couple years. </p>

<p>And who was it that arranged the Monaco Accords which lead to the BRICS and the over 180 un-aligned nations group?</p>

<p>It was two years ago when Neil told them if they were ever going make the accounts work for humanity, they would have to setup their own banking system.  Something outside and disconnected from the western, Cabal owned and controlled system.</p>

<p>And now look where we are today. It&#39;s happening.  And it wasn&#39;t because of Jean, and it surely wasn&#39;t because of Karen Hudes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fauxcapitalist is not a good source.  You can see that fauxcapitalist seems to think that the countries will accept Special Drawing Rights.  Instead, the BRICS, and the G-77 (over 130 developing countries) are refusing to use dollars as the international reserve currency.  The Federal Reserve Note is about to tank, taking US military capacity down with it.  That is why I went to Japan this summer, and why the Joint US Japan Committee under the Status of Forces Agreement accepted my proposal: <a href="http://presswire.com/pr/hudes/hudes_250714.html">http://presswire.com/pr/hudes/hudes_250714.html</a>   This is my last post here.

<p>This is how Reddit characterizes its blog: &quot;Fortunately, Karen has nothing to worry about with respect to censorship in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>Reddit doesn&#39;t seem to realize how foolish they are looking at the moment.</p>

<p>Karen, you&#39;re in a &quot;sub&quot; reddit. The subreddit is called <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;Reddit&quot; isn&#39;t making these decisions.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a blog.</p>

<p>You&#39;re overreacting. All of this was the result of a miscommunication. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry there was so much disrespect displayed towards you in these comments Karen. </p>

<p>While it is certainly understandable that some folks may wish to ask you about what got you into whistleblowing and how your vision for the future may gel with their individual vision; the level of vitriol in these comments was absolutley unacceptable.</p>

<p>You were going to be an invited guest of this subreddit and should have been treated by the users as such.</p>

<p>This is not to say that you would have been above reproach (we certainly welcome open discussion and criticism); but the vacuous personal attacks on display in this thread were disgusting and for that our entire community owes you a apology. </p>

<p>Its a pretty horrible attitude to have toward a guest.  It basically reads &quot;I can&#39;t wait to tear this person down because of my preconceived idea about them&quot;</p>

<p>This is exactly how this community is treated by reddit at large on a daily basis and I&#39;m personally disgusted by it.</p>
