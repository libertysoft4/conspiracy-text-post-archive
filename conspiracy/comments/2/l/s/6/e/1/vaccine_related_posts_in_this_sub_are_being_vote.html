<p>It and it&#39;s comments get down voted to shit. But a quick look in &quot;other discussions&quot; shows why.

    <div class="md"><p>And they keep their maps of highly profitable vaccine-induced diseases private; HIV, Diabetes Type 1, Asthma, Motor Neurone Disease, Leukemia, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, HIV, Muscle Wasting Diseases, Regressive Autism and Alzheimer&#39;s.  Let&#39;s not forget vaccine-induced Crib Death, they tell us it&#39;s a &#39;Mystery&#39;, what they mean is that one of their products causes it and they don&#39;t want you to claim compensation or stop taking their product i.e. DPT Vaccine AKA Crib Death Vaccine.</p>

<p>It&#39;s rather generous of offer us a CFR propaganda link, that&#39;s the Rockefellers, very scary to see the psychopathic Council on Foreign Relations involved with this, just like war, vaccines are another tool for the NWO agenda, if you are smart you will not trust any products which these people promote, they want to sterilize and spread disease via vaccine.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s move onto the science:-</p>

<p>This professor describes his disturbing findings about the Aluminum in vaccines</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCzdliixnmI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCzdliixnmI</a></p>

<p>More vaccines = worse infant mortality rate</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170075/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170075/</a></p>

<p>&quot;These findings demonstrate a counter-intuitive relationship: nations that require more vaccine doses tend to have higher infant mortality rates.&quot;</p>

<p>Pretty good video on Vaccines/Autism here, goes through the story of where the science is currently up to</p>

<p><strong>Do Vaccines Cause Autism?</strong> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S1-LgYyjQg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S1-LgYyjQg</a></p>

<p>A new study has found a link to the aborted fetal cells used in certain vaccines, this seems to be the cause of Autism in certain children</p>

<p>CDC whistleblower has admitted they&#39;ve been covering up the evidence showing the vaccines are causing Autism in certain cases</p>

<p><a href="http://sanevax.org/victims-2/">http://sanevax.org/victims-2/</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s one of the world&#39;s top vaccine experts explaining why the vaccines are more dangerous than mild childhood disease</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdLMeULoujM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdLMeULoujM</a></p>

<p>CDC whistle-blower, Dr William Thompson, has stepped forward and admitted that the CDC has been covering up the vaccine/Autism link all along.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;My name is William Thompson.  I am a Senior Scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where I have worked since 1998. I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information  in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased  risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>The vaccines which don&#39;t have Mercury instead have Aluminum which is even more toxic to the brain as this professor explains</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This came out through a freedom of information request, it proves that secretly the CDC know how dangerous vaccines are.</p>

<p>Full transcript here <a href="http://www.safeminds.org/government-affairs/foia/Simpsonwood_Transcript.pdf">http://www.safeminds.org/government-affairs/foia/Simpsonwood_Transcript.pdf</a></p>

<p>Key quotes below:-</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Johnston, pg. 14-15 &amp; 19-20: &quot;The data on its toxicity (shows) it can cause neurologic and renal toxicity, including death.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Weil, pg. 24: &quot;There are just a host of neurodevelopmental data that would suggest that we’ve got a serious problem.&quot; .... &quot;the potential for aluminum and central nervous system toxicity was established by dialysis data. To think there isn’t some possible problem here is unreal.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 31: &quot;we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposure and outcomes for these different exposures and outcomes.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 44: &quot;Now for speech delays, which is the largest single disorder in this category of neurologic delays. The results are a suggestion of a trend with a small dip. The overall test for trend is highly statistically significant above one.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Bernier, pg. 113: &quot;So we are asking people who have a great job protecting this information up until now, to continue to do that until the time of the ACIP meeting. So to basically consider this embargoed information.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Johnson, pg. 198: &quot;This association leads me to favor a recommendation that infants up to two years old not be immunized with Thimerosal containing vaccines if suitable alternative preparations are available.” ... &quot;I do not want that grandson to get a Thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Weil, pg. 207: &quot;The number of dose related relationships are linear and statistically significant. You can play with this all you want. They are linear. They are statistically significant.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Brent, pg. 229 &quot;we are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Clements, pg 247- 249: &quot;that I am very concerned that this has gotten this far, and that having got this far, how you present in a concerted voice the information to the ACIP in a way they will be able to handle it and not get exposed&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Bernier, pg. 256: &quot;just consider this embargoed information, if I can use that term, and very highly protected information&quot;</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, obviously shills are overrunning the vaccine topics, but I think there&#39;s also too much discourse over it as well amongst both sides, to the point where neither side is willing to see it from the other&#39;s perspective. Not to mention that a lot information from either side can&#39;t be trusted because it&#39;s either skewed at the source or from those posting, for any myriad of reasons. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no calm discussion about it anymore. Either one person is right or the other is wrong and there&#39;s no wiggle room. Same thing with many topics here. Either side is automatically wrong, and then it&#39;s just viscous, brutal name calling and insult hurling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your views are not represented by the majority of doctors and scientists. You reference the fringe while dismissing the majority(millions) as being lying psychopaths working for the NWO.  The whole NWO plot makes no damn sense either. The rich need a large population to buy what they sell and work for them, why would they get rid of their market/resources? </p>

<p>When you look at the NWO plot and everything involved with the bilderbergs, CFR, Trilateral commission, illuminati, freemasons, of course it is some satanic plot to destroy Christianity and take your guns, lol, it literally has as much logic as this lady. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You certainly fit the stereotype, most people are to lamed to accept that modern medicine is monied, antiquated and oriented towards extremely expensive medial care routines of which are often not always effective. Front line medical workers are aware there&#39;s a problem with vaccination, I recall seeing a number of MSM articles describing nurses being forced to vaccinate, which is odd no? the perfect preventive medicine is being rejected by educated medical workers? But people are stupid enough to trust the government, an instrument of the plutocratic class, to protect their own self interests, its the height of deference of ones own responsibility in a society.</p>

<p>So conspiratard, go back to what ever perceptual cesspool you came from and continue drinking your plutocratic cool-aid. </p>

I myself have been researching vaccines for over 10 years so have had access to a lot of information which you won&#39;t have done, I can understand why the mainstream propaganda will have made you feel like my posts are a little crazy, but take your time and all will eventually become clear.</p>
