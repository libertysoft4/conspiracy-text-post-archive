<p>I don&#39;t think the bible is a good measuring stick for physical anthropology either.  I think the real question here is why would anyone wanna live 1000+ years?  Not in this economic system where the rich rape the poor.  Maybe in the <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Money">Star Trek</a> economic system, sure.  But the reality:</p>

<p>1000 years of working 60+ hours a week with no vacation allowed.
1000 years of sitting in traffic or the subway.<br/>
1000 years of paying taxes.<br/>
1000 years of inflation.<br/>
1000 years of war. </p>

<p>I&#39;m suggesting that the direction we are currently heading is a kludge, a hard uphill struggle when it doesn&#39;t need to be. Simple changes such as avoiding foods that are known to be poisonous to us and being aware of how to fix those poisons when they get out of hand. How do you dissolve coal tars from the body? How do you remove tree resins? How do you get good natural sources of unadulterated collagens into the system? How do you get rid of petroleum food products that junk up the system?</p>

<p>There is no point in denying people what they want, but for them to be oblivious to these harms is idiotic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, well lets look at ancient monuments of the polytheists. Stonehenge or perhaps Göbekli Tepe. These are altars on which animal or even human sacrifices to the Gods occured. The feast was the most important part of their spirituality. They surely didn&#39;t waste a single drop of meat, and probably ate the whole kill.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardonicism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardonicism</a></p>

<p><em>Among the very ancient people of Sardinia, who were called Sardi or Sardoni, it was customary to kill old people. While killing their old people, the Sardi laughed loudly. This is the origin of notorious sardonic laughter (Eugen Fehrle, 1930), now meaning cruel, malicious laughter. In light of our findings things begin to look different. Laughter accompanies the passage from death to life; it creates life and accompanies birth. Consequently, laughter accompanying killing transforms death into a new birth, nullifies murder as such, and is an act of piety that transforms death into a new life.[7]</em></p>

<p>The Blue Zones. Some of these ancient religions still practice old habits of eating &quot;traditionally&quot;. Not cannibals, but yeah, more traditionally.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Zone">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Zone</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re also new to The Bible. The Bible records approximately 6,000 years of &quot;history&quot; (and I use the term <em>very</em> loosely). The people you say it says lived several hundred years existed within that 6,000 year period, not before that 10,000 year mark where you say we started eating bad food.</p>

<p>On the topic of eating bad food, don&#39;t you think food killed humans a lot more often before techniques like pasteurization were invented than after?</p>

<p>On the topic of The Bible, you realize it&#39;s a fable just like the Odyssey and the Epic of Gilgamesh, right? That religion is the most broadly reaching, most thorough control mechanism that TPTB have over the majority of the population?</p>

<p>Finally, I recall reading about studies into nutrition that have found that dramatically reduced caloric intake measurably extends the lifespans of certain mammals, including mice or rats and humans. Obviously eating &quot;dumber&quot; (highly processed foods, fatty foods, extremely salty foods, way too much sugar, etc.) shortens life spans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, mythologically speaking. When sacrificing virgins to the Gods.</p>

<p>Who do you think the Gods were?</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sacrifice_in_Maya_culture">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sacrifice_in_Maya_culture</a></p>

<p><em>During the pre-Columbian era, human sacrifice in Maya culture was the ritual offering of nourishment to the gods. Blood was viewed as a potent source of nourishment for the Maya deities, and the sacrifice of a living creature was a powerful blood offering. By extension, the sacrifice of a human life was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice. Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.[1]</em></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.world-mysteries.com/science/ancient-ruins-of-tiwanacu-and-pumapunku/">http://blog.world-mysteries.com/science/ancient-ruins-of-tiwanacu-and-pumapunku/</a></p>

<p><em>Tiwanaku (Spanish: Tiahuanaco and Tiahuanacu) is an important Pre-Columbian archaeological site in western Bolivia, South America.</em></p>

<p><em>TIAHUANUCO lies almost in the very centre of the great terrestrial basin of lakes Titicaca and Aullagas, and in the heart of a region which may be properly characterized as the Tibet of the New World. Here, at an elevation of twelve thousand nine hundred feet above the sea, in a broad, open, unprotected, arid plain, cold in the wet and frigid in the dry season, we find the evidences of an ancient civilization, regarded by many as the oldest and the most advanced of both American continents.</em></p>

<p>I mean seriously, how do you fight ebola virus? With transfusions. So yeah... could you imagine what sort of benefit might be had be eating virgin meat, or perhaps even transfusing blood? Maybe Type-O wasn&#39;t an issue back then?</p>

<p>Anyways, I once read that germ free mice, in a lab live something around 8% longer. So that&#39;s not so significant. However, what if they were fed the most optimal diets possible, would they live longer then? I know they do if you give something simple, like CoQ10. Or that&#39;s what I saw once.</p>

<p>Guess where CoQ10 is found in a mammals body? In the heart. Guess what CoQ10 supplements do? They improve your heart. Real tough to figure out, right?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXbEczOB90E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXbEczOB90E</a></p>

<p>What is true about that presentation, is that we only began to chew gums within the last few thousand years.</p>

<p>Gum is traditionally saps from trees. It is the juice that stays in our system for 7+ years and leads to things such as obesity which is in truth a mild case of mild lymphedema (probably petroleum food products). Google images will give insight to that medical phenomenon where our lymphatic system fails to circulate properly or retains substance inappropriately.</p>

<p>I also agree that it&#39;s difficult to discover the truth of the matter and determine if people actually did live far longer in the ancient past but, having said that, I don&#39;t think the difficulty in discovering the truth should cause us to jump to conclusions or assumptions.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t think that an animal living to be hundreds or thousands of years old definitively proves anything with regard to humans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re correct on some accounts.</p>

<p>The organisms which live the longest also co-incidentally, one could say are, the least mobile, and least prone to stumbling across foreign eco-systems which they have not yet adapted to living well in.</p>

<p>So, if there ever was a time when humans lived for hundred of years at a time, it most certainly was among small groups of tribe in civilizations that were isolated from others.</p>

<p>The orcas, maybe they are an exception seeing as how homogeneous the oceans might be in terms of nourishment?</p>

<p>Where is the best place on Earth as a candidate for that one?</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumapunku">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumapunku</a></p>

<p><em>Pumapunku or Puma Punku (Aymara and Quechua puma cougar, puma, punku door, hispanicized Puma Puncu) is part of a large temple complex or monument group that is part of the Tiwanaku Site near Tiwanaku, Bolivia.</em></p>

<p><em>Tiwanaku is significant in Inca traditions because it is believed to be the site where the world was created.[1] In Aymara, Puma Punku&#39;s name means &quot;The Door of the Puma&quot;. The Pumapunku complex consists of an unwalled western court, a central unwalled esplanade, a terraced platform mound that is faced with stone, and a walled eastern court.[2][3][4]</em></p>

<p>One could speculate forever...</p>

<p><em>As was characteristic of civilizations around this time, the Tiwanaku actively incorporated human sacrifice into their culture. The remains of dismembered bodies have been found throughout the area. Ceramic artifacts depict imagery of warriors, masked with puma skulls, decapitating their enemies and holding trophy skulls, adorned with belts of human heads with their tongues torn out.[14] It is believed that, because of certain markings on stones found at Puma Punku, the Gate of the Sun was originally part of Puma Punku.[16]</em></p>

<p><em>Ask most people who are the oldest civilization or where the oldest civilization lived and you&#39;ll here answers like Mesopotamia (Iraq), Egypt or Iran. While these cultures can be traced back to 4000 B.C., the mysterious ruins of Tiahuanaco, in Bolivia, could be 14,000 years old!</em></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibalism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibalism</a></p>

<p><em>While there is universal agreement that some Mesoamerican people practiced human sacrifice, there is a lack of scholarly consensus as to whether cannibalism in pre-Columbian America was widespread. At one extreme, anthropologist Marvin Harris, author of Cannibals and Kings, has suggested that the flesh of the victims was a part of an aristocratic diet as a reward, since the Aztec diet was lacking in proteins. While most pre-Columbian historians believe that there was ritual cannibalism related to human sacrifices, they do not support Harris&#39;s thesis that human flesh was ever a significant portion of the Aztec diet.[63][64][65] Others have hypothesized that cannibalism was part of a blood revenge in war.[66]</em></p>

<p>They wouldn&#39;t do it, if their grand parents were dying early. Look at humans today. We throw up a huge fuss when we discover what is bad for our health, you know, minus hyper consumerist self interests.</p>

<p>Kings and Queens, royal lineages, probably ate what was most nourishing and proven to be sustainable for longevity purposes. You don&#39;t wake up one morning, and say hey, let&#39;s see if this will work. People develop these things after millenniums of trial and error and effort.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_cranial_deformation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_cranial_deformation</a></p>

<p>These royal lineages were doing things, because historically they worked, and they were mastered.</p>

<p>In other words, there was a time, when the Gods walked among the &quot;slaves&quot; and commanded them to fullfill their greatest desires, and yeah, the Gods were athiests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, well lets look at ancient monuments of the polytheists. Stonehenge or perhaps Göbekli Tepe. These are altars on which animal or even human sacrifices to the Gods occured. The feast was the most important part of their spirituality. They surely didn&#39;t waste a single drop of meat, and probably ate the whole kill.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardonicism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardonicism</a></p>

<p><em>Among the very ancient people of Sardinia, who were called Sardi or Sardoni, it was customary to kill old people. While killing their old people, the Sardi laughed loudly. This is the origin of notorious sardonic laughter (Eugen Fehrle, 1930), now meaning cruel, malicious laughter. In light of our findings things begin to look different. Laughter accompanies the passage from death to life; it creates life and accompanies birth. Consequently, laughter accompanying killing transforms death into a new birth, nullifies murder as such, and is an act of piety that transforms death into a new life.[7]</em></p>

<p>The Blue Zones. Some of these ancient religions still practice old habits of eating &quot;traditionally&quot;. Not cannibals, but yeah, more traditionally.</p>
