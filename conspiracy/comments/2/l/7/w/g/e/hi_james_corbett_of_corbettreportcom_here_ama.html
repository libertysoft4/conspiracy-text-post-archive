    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I do believe Snowden is a limited hangout. Like every good limited hangout, it produces some good. i.e. the public becomes more broadly aware of some issue and some percentage of them follow the cookie trail down the rabbit hole (to mix a metaphor). But it also tells us nothing fundamentally new and obscures some very important aspects of the intelligence/surveillance complex, specifically the role of the CIA who Snowden &quot;used to&quot; work for and still claims allegiance to.</p>

<p>I plan on doing an interview with Douglas Valentine on the CIA angle of the Snowden story in particular and a more in-depth podcast documenting the psyop in general, but in the meantime you can see this editorial I wrote for the International Forecaster:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Since you&#39;re mentioning a future interview here, I feel like this is just as good a place as any to make a request.</p>

<p>It would make my day to see you interview any of the following people:</p>

<ul>
<li>Russ Tice</li>
<li>William Binney</li>
<li>Tom Drake</li>
<li>John St.Clair Akwei</li>
<li>Chris Hedges</li>
<li>Russell Brand</li>
<li>Tim Wu</li>
<li>Noam Chomsky</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;d especially love to hear Noam Chomsky address what looks, from here, like his irreconcilable support for the institution of the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I loved your documentary on the Federal Reserve and would love to see one on any of the following if you ever have the time for it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Operation Mockingbird</li>
<li>The CFR</li>
<li>The non-profit/NGO community</li>
<li>The Big Four</li>
</ul>

<p>He is obviously the UK equivalent to Alex Jones...he is the quintessential &quot;turd in the pool&quot; and serves only to repel ordinary people from looking into corruption and wrong-doing by the supposed <em>elite</em> of our society.</p>

<p>His new book is called &quot;Revolution&quot;...which is of no surprise as I always thought he was revolting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speak for Abby, but being her brother that you speak of I&#39;d be happy to combat some of the half-truths and distortions you&#39;ve just offered up on a platter.  </p>

<p>First of all if you think we are using the term &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; or &#39;tinfoil hats&#39; non-ironically or in any way intended to disparage good quality 9/11 research, you are either not paying attention (maybe listened to only a small part of the episode and lost the context) or simply upset that Abby distanced herself (slightly) from some of what we both perceive to be unhelpful and potentially destructive methods to spread 9/11 truth and as a result are holding a grudge against 2 people who still care deeply about uncovering the truth about 9/11.
How many other people have spent almost a year of their lives investigating and pulling archival footage and then editing a film about the 2001 Anthrax attacks? Maybe to someone who just goes around screaming &#39;google WTC7&#39; 24/7 it wouldn&#39;t seem that important to 9/11 truth to focus so much on anthrax, but I&#39;m not trying to reach those people. I&#39;m slowly trying to build a bridge between those afraid to touch 9/11 truth and those who are not, and it can&#39;t be done by staying in the infinite loop so many truthers for over a decade have (corbett being an exception to this, among many other good researchers). </p>

<p>I will never stop pushing the cause of 9/11 truth forward and neither will Abby.  </p>

<p>So please stop mischaracterizing the work we do, and more specifically that I do on the Media Roots Podcast. Anybody with the patience to listen to our typically 2-3 hour podcasts will immediately see that the above poster is grossly mistaken. There are &#39;bad&#39; conspiracy theories and there are &#39;good&#39; conspiracy theories, we have discussions about which aspects of certain conspiracies we think are crap or poorly researched and which ones are sound and check out. </p>

<p>edit: I rarely come onto reddit, I was here for the Corbett ama. So if someone wants to engage with me in a civilized manner you can do so on twitter @fluorescentgrey, but I don&#39;t tolerate people trolling or spreading things bordering on misinformation (as the above poster has done), I appreciate lively debate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow.  Shots fired.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin - It so happens that I, actually, am a big fan of Media Roots Radio, and have listened to all of the broadcasts thereof that can still be gotten from iTunes / Soundcloud.  Your Kurt Haskell interview, your report on Bin Laden&#39;s death, &#39;9/11: How We All Became Boiled Frogs,&#39; your exposure of the rebranding of PNAC by snakes like Jamie Kirchick et al - these are among my favorite pieces of alternative journalism.  Abby&#39;s Gitmo report was really moving.   I think &#39;American Anthrax&#39; was a stellar production - it&#39;s one of my favorite &#39;introductory rabbit hole&#39; docs for the newly initiated - &#39;here; this is one we know for sure is total bullshit and this guy has documented it.&#39;  So let&#39;s get that on the table, going in.  </p>

<p>It is, in fact, my respect for both your careers, rather than the lack thereof, that has led to my dismay &amp; critical commentary regarding much of the tone of your recent work wrt 9/11.  I must stand by it; I do not believe it &#39;distortion&#39; or &#39;misinformation&#39; at all to point out how Abby has, repeatedly and specifically, mentioned her &#39;self-distancing&#39; from the 9/11 truth movement; how the use of the word &#39;conspiracy&#39; to mean &#39;marginal or dismissable view&#39; has begun to creep into your reportage (see:  Gitmo episode) or that, when asked flat out by Joe Rogan, Abby made a meek reply about how she &#39;still had questions but couldn&#39;t say it was an inside job&#39; - a stunning statement, coming from a woman who has participated in hundreds of hours of documentation and analysis that screams for just that conclusion.  </p>

<p>I do not make these remarks without sympathy.  In my observation, Abby has been perhaps the most sandwiched and rag-dolled figure in the entire alt-media universe, particularly in recent years.  As someone who clearly thinks a lot about &#39;finding a broader audience&#39; and &#39;making a mass difference&#39; - very much the extrovert - she has ironically had to deal with a more diverse constellation of hostility than maybe anyone else in her field:  howls from the FPI shills of the world denouncing her as a &quot;Kremlin puppet&quot; (God, I could go on all day about the RT America / PressTV phenomenon and what it <em>really</em> represents, and it ain&#39;t &quot;Kremlin shills&quot;); snide remarks from strongman-worshippers like Webster Tarpley about her &#39;Putin-slandering narcissism&#39; for having the moral courage to speak out against her network&#39;s interests; the fickle vagaries of the up-and-down fads of the 9/11 truth movement (&#39;gatekeeper!  gatekeeper!&#39; - and here I am now; et tu, anacardo?) and, always, an endless parade of drooling bros packing every comments section, fetishizing her for her beauty.  </p>

<p>I am not insensitive to these pressures or what they must do - her emotional response to her Gitmo experiences, her obvious relief at being <em>appreciated</em>, was very moving, and, speaking personally, I have my own sister, herself a huge extrovert and world-class charmer whom I also tend to idolize.  That sympathy does not, to my mind, dim the necessity I feel to point out these dangerous flirtations with the boundaries of truth and integrity in the name of accessibility or reaching a broader audience.  </p>

<p>Many times on MR, you have discussed your frustrations &amp; conflicted feelings with the need for the compromise of ideals in order to spread the word, and I would point out that there is such a thing as a balance too far.  To Abby, I would paraphrase another of the tragically-underrepresented female voices in the alt-media movement, Catherine Austin Fitts, a woman who has suffered greatly for her work - as for the place humanity is going, there isn&#39;t ultimately going to be any room for staying in the middle; for understanding the beast, but trying to compromise with it to get along.  </p>

<p>You may sniff at such pronouncements from someone who has made zero original contributions to the cause of truth and liberty, who has authored no work, made no original investigations, placed his reputation on the line nowhere beyond the confines of reddit, and generally not given even a fraction of the blood, sweat and tears that you and your sister have; you would be right.  Yet I feel I must stand by them.</p>

<p>This is hardly the way I would have ever preferred to be &#39;introduced&#39; to Robbie Martin, someone who, like James Corbett, has struck me as &#39;my kind of guy&#39; from the moment of my introduction to his work; nor do I feel terribly comfortable in adding to an enormous tangent from what IMO has been an outstanding AMA, but given the circumstances, I feel I must make a comprehensive and public reply.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to respond to any of the things Abby specific, but I am 100% sure that based on your feelings about Abby&#39;s view you have misinterpreted our discussions in the context of Media Roots Radio. If you have a problem with us critiquing aspects of the 9/11 truth movement or the way we break down conspiracy culture and how its disseminated poorly or effectively in a general sense, then I&#39;m definitely guilty of doing that. Other than that, I&#39;m not sure what else I can tell you that I didn&#39;t already say, maybe that a new sub-series has started on Media Roots Radio titled the 9/11 Bulletin with 3 episodes so far?
anyways, carry on </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn, that sucks. </p>

<p>What I think is interesting though is that 9/11 truth has morphed into this thing where people like Abby Martin, Charlie Veitch, Ron Paul, Stefan Molyneux, and countless other individuals in the liberty/truth/alternative media sphere denounce 9/11 truth but we all kind of know they&#39;re only denouncing it to avoid career suicide. It&#39;s like this weird cognitive bias where they know the truth, we know the truth, and we know that they know, but they basically have no way of publicly supporting it because society-at-large has made that belief on the level, if not worse, of stating you&#39;re a racist, or stating you support Hitler, etc., etc. </p>

<p>Anyone that looks at the evidence with a truly open mind will have no choice but to see the official story cannot be true (WTC 7 anyone?). </p>

<p>But this is why 9/11 truth will never be mainstream, because the powers that be have created a climate where the shame foisted on you by society in stating your support for this particular idea is not worth it: not for rational actors at least...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speak to Assange&#39;s position, I have problems with him that I won&#39;t go into but if you&#39;ve spent a great deal of time inside the 9/11 truth movement like I have you&#39;ll learn very quickly that sometimes people&#39;s passion and narrow focus on 9/11 can lead to quite annoying personality traits. I don&#39;t blame truthers for not being the most socially functional people though,  a lot of them have let their anger and desperation get the better of them. This doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re all crazy or annoying though, there are plenty of people plowing forward with original research who are reasonably sane (aren&#39;t we all just a little bit crazy?).  I just think that criticizing aspects of the movement in some circles is simply not allowed, if you have a problem with people in it or talking points people repeat people can easily confuse that for some kind of blanket criticism of the movement as a whole. 
Go check out the work being done on 9/11 blogger,  History Commons,  Jon Gold,  Kevin Ryan, Corbett, Graeme McQueen. None of these people are annoying to me and have carved their own path trying to uncover new truths. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i basically agree with you on this point.  except it would be more accurate, in my opinion, to say that assange is compromised.  i don&#39;t think he started out working for the cia, and was assigned the task of being a &quot;limited hangout&quot;.  it is much more likely that mossad threatened to kill his son and mother if he didn&#39;t keep his fucking mouth shut about 9/11.  so he does.  (and i would too, frankly -- which wouldn&#39;t make me a &quot;limited hangout&quot;.)  right idea - wrong definition.</p>

<p>and yes, IMO it was a grand plan... tptb are very patient </p>

<p>edit; since this is the 3rd highest comment you will see from the AMA</p>

<p>OP thinks Snowden is a limited hangout</p>

<p>if you agree, subscribe and post to <a href="/r/limitedhangouts">/r/limitedhangouts</a> ... the sub dedicated to saying &quot;hey is this a limited hangout? shit... maybe....  </p>

<p>TIL about this link Corbett posted this 2 months,,, </p>

<p>“Team Security State” refers to Greenbacks&#39; critics. Or, more accurately, that subset of critics who are opposed to the Snowden leaks on the grounds that he&#39;s a “traitor” and the leaks “harm American security.” As you might guess, I am of the belief that there are more than just those two teams, but we&#39;ll come to that in a moment.</p>

<pre><code>        So Team Security State fired first this week, with Politico Magazine&#39;s Michael Hirsh penning an article with the interrogative headline “Has Greenwald, Inc. Peaked?” As one would expect, the article comes down on the side of “yes” without having the journalistic cajones to actually say it:

        “Will there be many more Snowdens to come, based on Greenwald’s &#39;model&#39;?” Hirsh asks. “Perhaps. But it’s more likely that Greenwald Inc. has already peaked. The NSA, duly chastened by Snowden’s leaks, is changing under presidential directives that will rein in its mass collection of telephone &#39;metadata&#39;—its most controversial program—while most of the rest of us have moved on. &#39;I think there’s a bit of Snowden fatigue out there right now,&#39; said former NSA director Michael Hayden.”

        Team Greenbacks fired back with a flurry of “Why, I Never...” type articles. Erik Wemple&#39;s Washington Post entry, “7 problems with Politico Magazine’s hit piece on Glenn Greenwald” is a typical example:

        “To count the fact that the NSA is being forced to rein in its telephony collection &#39;while most of the rest of us have moved on&#39; points to a continuing — not withering — impact of the Greenwald-Snowden stuff,” Wemple objects, adding: “Only in a world with a sleeping editor can one quote Michael Hayden as attesting to Snowden fatigue.”

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, mate.  I can&#39;t resist one more follow-up question, if you don&#39;t mind.  (Frankly, I watch your podcasts regularly, and thoroughly appreciate your perspectives.)</p>

<p>With respect to the argument that Snowden is a &quot;limited hangout&quot; in support of (as you suggest) &quot;the public to accept total surveillance&quot;:</p>

<p><strong>Prior to Snowden, &quot;most Americans&quot; didn&#39;t know that every communication (phone, email, net post, etc.) was being logged.</strong></p>

<p>Now fast-forward to post-Snowden disclosures:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Now &quot;most Americans&quot; (and the world) do know that everything is being logged.  </p></li>
<li><p>CIA officials have been publicly recognized as liars (lying to Congress).  </p></li>
<li><p>Congressional members (e.g., Feinstein) have been embarrassed for having &quot;hidden&quot; the realities of the FISA court.</p></li>
<li><p>America&#39;s global political relations have been strained with &quot;allies&quot;.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Correct me if I am wrong, but I would have imagined that the intelligence elite would have preferred to keep these details/realities secret.  No?</strong></p>

<p>Given the choice between:  Tell the world or DON&#39;T, I am pretty sure most in the intelligence community would have said &quot;DON&#39;T TELL THE WOLRD&quot;.</p>

<p>Given the choice between:  Purposefully trigger a public debate, and NO DEBATE... I am pretty sure most in the intelligence community would prefer ZERO PUBLIC DEBATE.</p>

<p>Given the choice between:  Publicly exposing top-level liars (Feinstein, Clapper, etc.) and NOT... I am pretty sure that most in the intelligence community would prefer NO PUBLIC EXPOSURE of lies/corruption.</p>

<p>Given the choice between:  Publicly exposing the FISA court for being completely inept, and NOT.... </p>

<p>...well, I think you get my point.</p>

<p>Seems to me that Snowden has legitimately pissed-off (directly or indirectly) <strong><em>nearly everyone</em></strong> at the highest levels of intelligence community.</p>

<p>Please explain to me:</p>

<ol>
<li> What I am missing; AND</li>
<li> How &quot;they are all in on it&quot;; AND</li>
<li> How &quot;it was all part of the planed &#39;limited hangout&#39; to <strong><em>ADVANCE</em></strong> global clandestine surveillance.&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p>So what&#39;s the alternative? </p>

<p>You would have rather Snowden not said anything?  Kept it quiet ?</p>

<p>Is that what you are saying?  </p>

<p>Basically: <strong>What we DON&#39;T know won&#39;t hurt us as much as if we DO know?</strong></p>

<p>At face value (and with all due and sincere respect), that&#39;s just an absurd argument.  Perhaps I am missing your point.  </p>

<p>Please do clarify, if you would, because I believe this strikes at the heart of the &quot;Snowden is a &#39;limited hangout&#39;&quot; proposition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the response.</p>

<p>A follow-up question, if I may...</p>

<p>I believe among the most significant disclosures that Snowden has revealed:  <strong>All &quot;raw&quot; NSA data is piped to Tel Aviv:</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/nsa-americans-personal-data-israel-documents">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/nsa-americans-personal-data-israel-documents</a></p>

<p>This is &quot;fundamentally new&quot; information.  (Am I wrong?)  And incredibly pertinent information. (Am I wrong?)</p>

<p>Finally, with respect, you didn&#39;t really answer my question:</p>

<p><strong>Do you believe Snowden&#39;s disclosures have done MORE harm than good?</strong></p>

<p>I am looking for a consideration of &quot;net-positive&quot; or &quot;net-negative&quot;, if you please.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Could the DOJ / White House be using Snowden&#39;s &#39;revelations&#39; as a means of gathering consent to legally justify mass surveillance?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Snowden isn&#39;t a &quot;limited hangout&quot;. It&#39;s not like the NSA slipped him some documents so that he would unknowingly leak them. He was a systems administrator in charge of doing the backups from the Pacific to DC. He had access to all of those things because he was in charge of backing them up, not because someone in the government wanted him to have access to them. He just kept a copy of the data for himself and then leaked it.</p>

<p>Seems like a pretty random choice for a limited hangout anyway. Is there anything in his background that would make him a better choice to release information than anyone else?</p>

<p>&quot;We’re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you’re studying that reality — judiciously, as you will — we’ll act again, creating other new  realities, which you can study too, and that’s how things will sort out. We’re history’s  actors . . . and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.&quot;  –  Bush White House aide Karl Rove explaining the New Reality to author Ron Suskind</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good answer. Especially with the rate and volume and, as you say, breathlessness of the alternative news media, it&#39;s easy to get stuck in that reaction mode only to realise, months later, that almost the entire content of one&#39;s mental space has in fact been dictated by what everybody else is saying.</p>

<p>I often wonder whether it&#39;s actually something of a tactic to keep the pace of these revelations so high that no one person can actually keep abreast of everything without sacrificing the ability to engage in their own free thought and conduct their own research or at least obtain a comprehensive picture of one key area.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think that some of the more outlandish conspiracy theories you see online (this subreddit included) about ancient cults, UFOs, the occult, and secret advanced technology actually do more to help the international banking cartel continue to perpetuate their financial schemes by deterring otherwise serious researchers from studying what is really hidden at the top of the financial &quot;pyramid&quot;?</p>

<p>Do you think that elements of the intelligence apparatus owned by this global banking monopoly are partially behind these outlandish theories? In the same way that the US gov&#39;t encourages people to believe there are UFOs at Area 51 to hide the real aircraft research that happens there, do secret online CIA trolls tell stories about the Illuminati and Zionists to hide more mundane crimes of greed and psychopathy?</p>

<p>As the international banking system is slowly being publicly revealed as the pyramid scheme that it is, how do you suggest people involved/employed within the establishment media (like myself) approach these subjects, while avoiding the psychological traps set in the minds of others by these ideas?</p>

<p>Issues regarding personal food security, alternative currencies, and the usage of some specific advanced technologies are definitely a few good options ---</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to add that the creation of grassroots organizations that enrich the lives those in your community, which directly challenge the State. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my grand example that I&#39;m working on.... A non-profit that feeds the unfortunate, providing them with farming skills and future career opportunities. </p>

<p>I&#39;m in the long process of building a farm where we utilize many different processes such as biodynamics, aquaponics, and vermiculture to name a few. Those who need assistance can come and help me with a wide range of activities, from going to our partner restaurants to collect veg waste for vermiculture, helping to manage livestock or to feed the fish in the aquaponics greenhouse.  I&#39;ve made arrangements with a couple local food trucks to accept an &quot;hours&quot; script from the folks who help me, providing them with free or discounted meals along with the compensation they receive from our profit sharing. The food trucks pay a discount for the veg and fish I produce, so they can pay out meals for this currency. </p>

<p>2, people need to be forming bonds with other skilled peoples, forming privately agreed upon Mutual Benefit Societies. I work with a doctor currently where we trade services. </p>

<p>3, consider financing through crowd-sourcing instead of traditional banking</p>

<p>4, Open Source Everything! I plan on being totally open with my business models -- for example, I&#39;m working with a partner to create a programmable automated system; software to put on a Rasberry Pi that could help micro-farmers to automate the timing of many aquaponics systems running in tandem. There are products that exist on the market, but we want to open source it. </p>

<p>4B - Open Source Ecology - look it up!</p>

<p>There are many more things</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Loved the video and good discussion here. Does make me sad that, while the direction is correct, Im still seeing a very limited discussion and advocacy of bitcoin. Seems people are taking a wait and see approach, but with bitcoin as well..its really just a matter of people waking up and switching to the new system. The technology already works. There are plenty of people ready to answer questions over at <a href="/r/bitcoin">/r/bitcoin</a> , but people need to open their eyes and get to action rather then just following the crowd with the price. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Here is the one thing that must replace the federal reserve.&quot;</p>

<p>I think you are misrepresenting the bitcoin community here as not being voluntary. Bitcoin is a completely voluntary free market currency, and you are putting it in the same light as the Federal Reserve, suggesting that people are being forced to use it. Your response here seems mostly a skeptical emotional reaction to the enthusiasm that many bitcoiners have. </p>

<p>&quot;Open up the box of complimentary currencies. Bitcoin is one of the arrows in that quiver, but there are many arrows.&quot;</p>

<p>Where are all the great functioning complimentary currency systems? They don&#39;t exist. They are small, and they are centrally controlled, unable to scale or be grow without being corrupted. Im ALL for supporting innovation in this field, but lets be honest. Nothing has been able to get off the ground without being shut down by the bankers. We all know about Bernard von NotHaus and the Liberty Dollar. Bitcoin is the first time we have had a technology to subvert the attack. Because bitcoin is decentralized, it has no central hub to attack or be corrupted.</p>

<p>&quot;Not even bitcoin is the ultimate implementation of that technology.&quot;</p>

<p>Its open source, and evolving. Was the internet really the ultimate implementation of the internet? Well...it evolved. Bitcoin is the Internet of money. I could easily go into great deal on the innovation thats unfolding, but the point is to consider that bitcoin may be here to stay, and it may not be realistic to think that something is going to replace it, anymore then a new internet would replace the internet. </p>

<p>Can you name an alternative cryptocurrency with a compelling use case?  Didnt think so. They are just copies of the bitcoin idea. Anything good would get rolled back up the stream into bitcoin. And this is exactly what is happening. <a href="http://avc.com/2014/10/sidechains/">http://avc.com/2014/10/sidechains/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bitcoin seems like it&#39;ll probably the base currency and protocol for many of the units of value people choose to hold as their money. There are new ideas every day. People can hold what they want and receive what they want, frictionlessly via their trade network.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is not the only decentralized currency either. Web of trust backed LETS enable any individual to be an issuer of currency backed by large groups. This can be done on paper with signatures or digitally with ripple and eventually, with side chains. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It can help the government too.   </p>

<p>1) Create a tax system that ends up effectively taxing P2P Bitcoin transactions around 1%. Avoiding this tax is illegal but not impossible.<br/>
2) Begin offering a new government created fork of the Bitcoin blockchain that has only the difference in a single way: The same 1% transaction tax you were effectively paying anyway with regular bitcoin, but this is simple and is built in to the code as the only change.<br/>
3) Do creative things with the price and influence media attention for a while<br/>
4) Make some small bureaucratic adjustments to the tax policy of original Bitcoin, that make it just noticeably more expensive or time consuming than using the new USBitcoin.<br/>
5) Business will save money using the USBitcoin and begin accepting it and giving a discount to customers that pay with it.
6) You kill the competition to your money monopoly just like you did when gold was outlawed for decades, but mostly instead of completely, because completely in this political climate will get too much backlash.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin is driven by greed, it’s in no way a rational solution to our monetary problems. It’s global, scarce, cashless and soon the first banks will provide usurious lending.</p>

<p>The lesson is: as long as we hope to breed money from money, not realizing it’s usually our own labor that breeds money for those holding a lot of it, we will be fooled by units like this.</p>

<p>Money must be cheap (interest-free) and plentiful, but stable. Only then can it be a good medium of exchange, allowing the producers of society the benefits of their labor, instead of the providers of capital.</p>

<p>Bitcoin offers none of these features.</p>

It&#39;s completely anonymous and secure if you use it correctly. Scarcity is a good thing.

<p>This article addresses <em>fractional reserve banking</em>, which I agree is a terrible thing, and I&#39;ve already noted is a feature of our current system that bitcoin <em>renders impossible</em>. Again, this is <em>not a feature of bitcoin</em>. Put another way: &quot;interest-free money&quot;, that ideal so praised in your article, is <em>what bitcoin is</em>! </p>

<p>I would encourage you to study how bitcoin works, then. It doesn&#39;t render fractional reserve banking impossible, just obsolete. The reason bitcoin gets rid of the need for banks is that it does everything that banks do, but better. With bitcoin, everyone on this earth can be their own bank. The main reason people use banks right now is for security. That is, they trust banks more with their money than themselves. It&#39;s still possible to steal people&#39;s bitcoins, and therefore there are still people who trust a third party with their coins, but bitcoin is driving a personal digital security revolution that is making huge advances, and I think in the next generation or so banks will be obsolete.</p>

<p>The other use for banks right now is to connect investors with investments. As with the hospitality industry (airbnb) and the taxi industry (uber), the financial industry is having its middlemen rendered obsolete by the Internet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you think of modern cosmology and quantum physics? One intriguing conspiracy theory that doesn&#39;t get much play outside of religious circles is that modern science is subservient to a paradigm reducing man to a non-spiritual materialist view. The popular Sheldon Drake &#39;Banned&#39; TedTalk approaches this idea somewhat, but there is more to be had with the Michelson/Morley experiment(s), evolutionary theory, helio v geo centrism, red shift paradigm, and efforts such as string theory, dark matter, and/or big bang inflation.</p>

<p>Have you considered this at all, or if not does it strike you offhand as worthy of consideration?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the question. As you may or may not know I started out as a physics major at university so cosmology and quantum physics have long been an interest of mine.</p>

<p>I am not really sure what question I am answering in particular here, but ultimately I do not believe that consciousness can be reduced to brain matter as the materialists would have it. More on that here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.corbettreport.com/interview-854-james-corbett-on-life-the-universe-and-everything/">http://www.corbettreport.com/interview-854-james-corbett-on-life-the-universe-and-everything/</a></p>

<p>However I think a lot of mistaken layman&#39;s interpretations of &quot;quantum physics&quot; get bandied about in ways that belittle the ideas themselves, so I&#39;m often wary about people who don&#39;t really know what they&#39;re talking about discussing the implications of quantum theory and the like.</p>

<p>It&#39;s good to hear from people that have taken some time to understand a bit of physics/cosmology/philosophy and are skeptical of the reductionist claims of the radical empiricists and materialists. </p>

<p>Thanks a lot for your work, I find your approach to investigative reporting quite a refreshing alternative to the tinfoil disinfo filling the net. I&#39;m most in awe of some the research you&#39;ve done along with Sibel Edmonds. I&#39;ve found it curious how she and others before and after came out with just ad shocking leaks and exposés but MSM did not gave them much attention, and there had to come a very videogenic agent out in order for whistleblowing to become a mainstream issue. Your opinion on the possibility of Snowden being a limited hangout agent, perhaps oblivious to his assigned role?</p>

<p>Do you exercise some heightened security measures for your communications/net usage?</p>

<p>Are we already in a sort of cold-WWIII situation between America/UK, Europe and Russia? Do you foresee the actual possibility of armed conflict as the American empire attempts further geopolitical expansion and securing of resource routes?</p>

<p>Seeing the chokehold that most world authorities want to sumbmit the net and all the consumer gizmos dependent on it to kept them under their control and surveillance, what is the privacy advocate and free-thinking net user to do? Any technology that shows promise? Maybe even going low tech to radio and such?</p>

<p>With that being said my question is what do you consider to be the smoking gun of all well regarded conspiracy theories.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard to pick a single smoking gun example, but the Warren Commission explanation for the JFK assassination is pretty widely believed to be wrong at this point, and I can&#39;t remember a time in my entire life where I believed that was the work of Oswald alone. More recently, 9/11 has been the gateway for a lot of people to begin exploring these subjects, myself included, but in my case it was the combination of evidence about 9/11 like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.corbettreport.com/episode-199-35-reasons-to-question-911/">http://www.corbettreport.com/episode-199-35-reasons-to-question-911/</a></p>

<p>With information about the history and nature of central banking (which I gleaned from &quot;The Money Masters&quot;) that really started to open my eyes.</p>

<p>Having said that, everyone has their own areas of interest and expertise and thus everyone has their own gateway into alternative history. I don&#39;t think the &quot;single smoking gun that everyone will believe&quot; exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey James! Huge fan of your website, been subscribed to your site for well over a year now. </p>

<p>I feel that we have three ‘ideologies’ that are shaping and guiding the world:<br/>
- We have the Zionist<br/>
- The Neo-conservative (PENAC)<br/>
- And a financial ‘ideology’ (Fractional Reserve Banking) which is the undergirding the entire structure.  </p>

<p>Two of these seem to be nationalist ideologies, while the financial institutions’ reach are global.  Are these all one is the same? Or will the banking institutions latch on to any nation that can carry them further to a world currency and government? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>JC,</p>

<p>Really great to have you here.  I personally discovered your (enormous) body of work a few months ago and have had one portion of it or another on blast pretty much every day since.</p>

<p>Question (w/ buildup):  In a historical context, how do you think the present day compares to, say, the eighteenth century, in terms of the buildup before the French Revolution?  I see a lot of parallels:  banks/corps = feudal lords, &quot;rule of law / consent of the governed&quot; = &quot;divine right of kings,&quot; and the present day being sort of a mass salonniere exercise of people trying to figure out just WTF is going on and how do we do something about it, only on the internet instead of in fashionable ladies&#39; drawing rooms.  Can we avoid the usual historical patterns of dying, revolutionary republics (chaos, then dictatorship?) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the question. I&#39;m no expert on the French Revolution (although it is a subject I would like to cover in more depth in the future), but there are obvious parallels between our current situation and the historical revolutionary periods of centuries past. One that I find particularly ironic is that the &quot;founding fathers&quot; of the U.S. were the conspiracy theorists of their own day:</p>

<p>But how do we avoid falling into the same pitfalls of nearly every &quot;revolution&quot; that we&#39;ve seen before?</p>

<p>Short answer: we have to evolve our conception of revolution. What is needed is not a &quot;storming of the Bastille&quot; incident but a revolution in consciousness. It is only from an understanding of ourselves as free human beings that we will ever become motivated to implement the <a href="http://www.corbettreport.com/?s=solutions">solutions</a> that actually make a difference.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no talk of <em>political</em> solutions. The hackers are hard at work at irrevocable defeating the panopticon with strong cryptography. </p>

<p>This of course benefits the CIA who took down Emperor Alexander of the NSA with one well-placed asset. I think of the Snowden operation more as an interagency weapon than a limited hangout, though it performs both functions admirably. It does not aid a wetworks agency to have a functioning panopticon, for it could spy on and blackmail them. Incidentally, I must agree with a CIA man that the web needs to be encrypted, and fast.
To that end, Snowden has been able to talk the tech talk. Strong cryptography, endpoint security, data encryption, he&#39;s talked the talk (to a convention hall full of developers at the SxSW conference). As a result, there have been many efforts by researchers and hackers to prevent physical infiltration as well. We also need trusted hardware, but that&#39;s another story...</p>

<p>The disinterested mass will of course know nothing of this, and only know to fear the all-seeing eye, not knowing that all the while they have the choice to hide as well as they want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The NSA underwent a transformation post-9/11 from COMSEC (COMmunication SECurity) to SIGINT (SIGnals INTelligence). The two practices are diametricaly opposed -- one concerns the securing of information, the other is interested in spying and exfiltration. </p>

<p>The NSA, throughout its known public history, has worked to both weaken and strenghten encryption standards. (For example, they fixed the s-box of the standardised DES (&quot;Data Encryption Standard&quot;) algorithm to immunize it from differential cryptanalysis, a method of attack then unknown in the public cryptography community). They also weakened the DES standard by reducing the key size to a manageable and crackable 56 bits (Today, crackable in a few days to a few weeks on your home computer). Comparably, an encryption standard that&#39;s stood the test of time and public scrutiny with a keysize of, say, 256 bits could not be cracked by brute force for thousands and thousands of years. Mathematical physics-based proofs for this are available if you&#39;re interested.</p>

<p>So after 9/11, COMSEC was deprioritized and much of the talent and resources went to SIGINT, and the digital panopticon. Once built, it allowed NSA employees to trivially spy on the communications of the then-barely-encrypted internet. I would guess that they, perhaps in collaboration with the FBI, began leveraging blackmail for unknown powerful players. </p>

<p>And now the speculative part. Maybe they were responsible for the Petraeus takedown, which signaled the CIA controllers that the NSA is becoming a nuisance to their operations.</p>

<p>I repeat, as someone well-versed in cryptography and with a reasonable grasp of mathematics, as long as your key is secure, strong encryption cannot be broken.  </p>

<p>I do not believe everything the TPTB touch is infused with evil, though they certainly use evil means to achieve their (also evil) goals. But sometimes I believe they make mistakes (I don&#39;t think DARPA&#39;s creation of the internet was part of a long-term plan for sociocultural dominance, though it&#39;s certaintly being reappropriated to that end.) Expect to see tools to render the digital panopticon moot and obsolete if just a few years -- there are quite a few neckbeardy scruffy crypto-anarchists double-checking and improving Tor code, and creating their own alternatives. the OTR messaging protocol, for example, is based on good, strong crypto and I have full confidence that the NSA is doing nothing but wasting space when they collect that encrypted communication. Even if they discovered my key later, they could not decrypt the previous message (just another neat mathematical quirk allowed by the universe called perfect forward secrecy)</p>

<p>In the short run though, the sheeeeeepeople will of course cower in fear of the imaginary all-seeing eye. In the long run, people like me will show them how to easily have privacy when they want it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the questions. It really depends on the podcast, and on what can be considered &quot;research.&quot; In one sense I was doing research for <a href="http://www.corbettreport.com/federalreserve/">Century of Enslavement</a> since 2006, but the actual production of the documentary took 7 months. Some podcasts can be done in one week using sources that I&#39;ve collected over years, others take a month or more. I&#39;m currently working on one of the most detailed reports I&#39;ve ever done on &quot;China and the NWO&quot; and tearing my hair out (haha) about how to put it together into a single, coherent narrative. I&#39;ve been working on it on and off for two months now, but hope to have it out this week.</p>

<p>As for disappearing info, it is difficult. That&#39;s why it&#39;s good practice for everyone to save important stories/files/documents locally to your hard drive (and back them up). Also, the Wayback Machine is your friend.</p>

Any tips or recommendations for family and neighbors coming down with strange illnesses? It seems most doctors here have no answers for the these mystery illnesses. Some are extremely serious. They just keep sending to other specialist on different islands. My family and I live sustainably from the land and sea. Should we avoid deep sea fish? Should we limit gathering seaweed, salt and limpets from the shoreline? And should we be cautious about picking up garbage/debris on the shoreline? Sorry, that was a lot of questions.

<p>Any tips or recommendations for family and neighbors coming down with strange illnesses? It seems most doctors here have no answers for the these mystery illnesses. Some are extremely serious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you elaborate at all on this?  What types of illnesses?</p>

<p>Also, not to unnecessarily scare you or anything but have you ever come across <a href="http://plumegate.wordpress.com/">this site?</a>  Full of documents obtained through FOIA but the basic gist of it is that Fukushima is a lot worse than we&#39;ve been told - and has been since the initial meltdown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link. The illnesses range from high amounts of mysterious blood in urine, vomit and fecal matter in multiple people, often resulting in hospitalization and testing with no cause or illness being identified, some of those cases are being told they have severe intestinal issues and dr unable to diagnose the cause, leukopenia and being hospitalized twice in isolation with no idea how the severe blood disorder developed and still is not getting better, strange tumor like lumps that test as negative for cancer in the esophagus that may require a stint for eating, extreme weight loss in 2 individuals almost like a wasting disease, both of those loosing weight has been tested for multiple types of cancers with no results, one of those cases can no longer pick up anything/cannot drive a car/ or do anything once considered normal activity, also family coming down with advanced cancer suddenly when they were very healthy, a young child who woke up with no balance couldn&#39;t walk for over three weeks and with terrible joint pains, the child&#39;s blood tests were lost by the hospital and took a lot of work to track down on the mainland, the reports came back as toxicity poisoning of heavy metals. The mother had testing done on the house, preschool and other common areas where the young child is during daily activities. No results came back showing what might have caused this illness. Strange body rashes with liquid filled pustules and dark red splotches around that. Thought to be a form of skin cancer at first. Testing was performed, biopsy and blood tests. The doctors are saying it is some type of sun allergy possibly. But not cancerous. Thyroid imbalances in multiple people with a sudden onset of it either hypo or hyper. Rare blood disorder recently diagnosed in another family member called hemochromatosis and the young woman will need a liver transplant soon. She is one of the youngest cases ever identified with this blood disorder. In 2011-2012 there was a high increase in still born babies. Babies born with birth defects like heart malformation, again tumor like lump in throat, and organs being displaced and backwards. And children seizing with no medical related answers as to why. There are also a lot of hospitalization a of people with severe diarrhea and vomiting without flu/food poisoning or any other related illness being diagnosed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn my friend.  I&#39;m really sorry to hear all that, I hate to read about these things.  I&#39;m not a doctor or expert, but having spent many, many hours reading about Fukushima and the massive cover-up that has taken place for the last few years, I think the two may very well be related.  Most of those things you described are documented symptoms of radiation poisoning.</p>

<p>Maybe try to find or buy a Geiger counter?</p>

<p>Are any of these doctors talking about and/or looking at radiation as a possible cause of some of these symptoms?  If they aren&#39;t, the question to ask is: <em>why aren&#39;t they</em>?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. Yes it is all very troubling and many have asked if radiation poisoning is the cause. Those questions get downplayed severely. My friend who really began asking those questions was the one who&#39;s daughters tests went missing for over a month. The state of Hawaii was not keeping good radiation tests for too long. Then they announced they would be keeping better records and setting up monitoring stations last year. No word yet about any of it. Hawaii depends on tourism and they don&#39;t want to panic people who might potentially come visit and spend money. I truly believe that&#39;s why people are being sent home with antibiotics and inconclusive tests results coupled with another dr apt with a specialist somewhere else. Round and round it goes. I really do need to purchase a Geiger counter. </p>

<p>If you do, or if you hear or notice anything else, don&#39;t hesitate to let me/us here know.  I am very interested in this subject as I personally believe that Fukushima is one of the largest cover-ups (and certainly the largest <em>provable</em> cover-up) of our lifetime and that the effects will become worse and more obvious as time goes on.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting that you mentioned that about the monitoring stations though because I&#39;ve noticed the same the last few years - many stations in the US have suspiciously &quot;been down&quot; or &quot;gone offline&quot; for days/weeks/months at a time.  Tons of mysterious &quot;die-offs&quot; on the west coast but nobody in the mainstream scientific community mentions the possibility of radiation.</p>

<p>That makes sense for tourism-centric Hawaii though but I think it may go even deeper than that.  According to that link I sent you before, there&#39;s an international effort in place to downplay the severity of Fukushima - to act like the worst <em>hasn&#39;t already happened</em> there.  So I don&#39;t think it&#39;s limited to Hawaii.</p>

<p>There have been tons and tons of reports coming out of Japan of similar symptoms and &quot;mysterious illnesses&quot; in recent months.</p>

<p>Anyway, good luck with everything and stay safe and, again, please keep me/us posted if you hear anything else.</p>

<p>&quot;CAS (Close Air Support) weapons included AGM-114 Hellfire, AGM-65 Maverick and TOW missiles. These mainly use shaped charge warheads believed to contain Uranium shaped charge liners (concept identified in US Patent 4441428 [55,56]. CAS operations in Fallujah also used 500lb GBU-12, 38 and possibly larger hard target guided bombs e.g. GBU-24 for hard targets and suspected bunkers. The advanced penetrator warhead versions of these (BLU-110, 111) use high-density metal ballast - either tungsten or Uranium [54,55,57]. Undepleted or low enriched Uranium contamination has been found in samples from heavily bombed locations in Afghanistan, Iraq and Lebanon [53,56,58].&quot;</p>

<p>I believe we must be new settlers, but instead of a riffle we need modern tools - - lawyers, grant writers, like minded people with skills and a philosophy.</p>

<p>I believe that the bankers and corporate ceos will keep killing and harming innocent people for profit until people start to kill them.</p>

<p>they own the law makers in every state, the judges are in their back pocket all the way to the SCOTUS - I see no way of saving or preserving the system in the US.</p>

<p>thank you for your time</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who are our controllers?</p>

<p>I must preface my statement by emphasizing that i am not a racist, nor a member of any race-related organization. In short, i subscribe largely to the &quot;one people, one earth&quot; philosophy, as i believe you do also.</p>

<p>Having said that, as a result of a great deal of research there is no doubt in my mind that there exists what one might call a Jewish criminal network that enjoys acute over-representation in vital spheres of influence, including the banking industry, the government, the news media and the entertainment industry.</p>

<p>For example, in the U.S. it is difficult, at best, to win a presidency without the approval and funding provided by Jewish lobby groups. I think many are aware that Jews essentially control the system of central banks which are in turn used to control government and finance wars. The same is true of the news and entertainment industries which are heavily influenced by Jews and which provide much of the sustenance for the opinions we form regarding issues of great importance.</p>

<p>My question is, why does no one speak of this elephant in the room which exercises a very disproportionate amount of influence upon the people of the world? Why does no one connect the obvious dots between ultra-wealthy, ultra-influential Jews and the problems we face?</p>

<p>I have tried to open a dialog regarding this issue with yourself (James), Sibel Edmonds, Abby Martin, Amber Lyon, Kerry Cassidy and several others and have never once received a reply.</p>

<p>It is my opinion that understanding the history of the Jews and the influence wielded by the &quot;1%&quot;, many of which are Jewish, is absolutely vital if one wants a clear understanding of the significant problems we all face today, why we are facing them, and why we continue to face them, and yet even creditable alternative media is utterly silent on this issue, refusing to even mention the word &#39;Jew&#39; when talking about subjects like central banks or politics or the entertainment industry. Why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve said since the very beginning of my podcast that WWIII starts in Iran. In fact, that was the title of my 2nd ever episode:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.corbettreport.com/episode-002-wwiii-starts-in-iran/">http://www.corbettreport.com/episode-002-wwiii-starts-in-iran/</a></p>

<p>I still think that Iran is the line in the sand for Russia/China to come off the sidelines, so that would still be a very serious move.</p>

<p>As for how they will do it, they can of course do a number of things like what you suggest, but let&#39;s not forget Seymour Hersh&#39;s revelation that Cheney actually did have a Northwoods-like incident ready to go to provoke war involving painting up an American boat to look like an Iranian PT boat and then use it to attack American ships in the Straits of Hormuz.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the question. This is an extremely difficult question to answer succinctly, but in short: anything I might say about the breakaway civilization is almost entirely conjecture, and I would be extremely cautious about anyone claiming to know what&#39;s really happening. It&#39;s a black box, and purposefully so. You might want to check out my attempt to grapple with this subject in the podcast:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well of course there are income taxes and the like. As a foreign resident on a visa, if I don&#39;t pay those taxes I will be kicked out of the country, so as long as I am here there&#39;s not much option on that front.</p>

<p>One of the most insidious aspects of the police state system here, though, is the fact that every foreigner is legally required by law to carry their &quot;foreign resident id card&quot; around everywhere they go. Police can by law stop you and ask to see it basically any time for basically any reason. The scariest thing is when I first came to Japan (pre-awakening, 2004), I didn&#39;t even think much of this. It wasn&#39;t until I saw the &quot;Gandhi&quot; biopic (of all things) and saw people willing to be brutalized and jailed for resisting the 1906 Registration Act in South Africa that I realized there was something deeply wrong with this. In some ways, that started me down the path toward being more receptive to the information that became The Corbett Report.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your part answer on the unknown state of the 3 cores.  I&#39;m not nearly convinced it is an unknown unknown.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not concerned about cleanup, but merely a direct observation of what they are dealing with.   If they say no technology can clean it up, what are they basing their assessment on?   No observations?  That sounds strange.</p>

<p>I read about this and other robots since 2012.   Were they unable to collect data?</p>

<p>&#39;&quot;The robot uses a zoom camera, laser range finder and dosimeter located at the tip of the arm to confirm detailed images, collect 3D data and identify the source of radiation,&quot; Honda said. It&#39;s designed to probe high, narrow, hard-to-reach areas.&#39; </p>

<p>&#39;In the early days of the crisis, Japanese officials were criticized for using foreign-made robots, instead of domestically developed ones, to venture into the plant.&#39; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey James! I really enjoyed, and highly recommend, your <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=QOmRk26jrNo">presentation on the questionable origins of planned parenthood</a>.</p>

<p>Having thoroughly exposed the eugenicist roots of planned parenthood, does it make you curious about the meteoric rise of bill gates? </p>

<p>Considering that <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Gates,_Sr.">his father</a> has been associated with the organization, is it really a surprise that his son should pursue a similar cause?</p>

<p>For example, bill gates <a href="http://naturalsociety.com/bill-gates-faces-trial-india-illegally-testing-tribal-children-vaccines/">currently faces trial in India</a> for illegally testing vaccines on tribal children.</p>

<p>How are figures like Margaret Sanger even talked about with respect today?</p>

<p>Are the lunatics running this asylum?</p>

<p>How can we denounce the &quot;monstrous&quot; eugenics of the Nazis when our entire society seems to be run by people who share a similar mentality. </p>

<p>Any possibility of doing the Joe Rogan podcast or Eddie Bravo Podcast?</p>

<p>Your acquaintances Richard Gage and Ryan Dawson have done Eddie Bravo podcast.</p>

<p>Actually Stefbot/Stefan Molyneux changed quite a bit after doing JRE and not for the better i think.

    <div class="md"><p>Hello friend,
This is Brian here reporting as always from the snowy climbs of Anchorage, Alaska.  I started watching your videos 1 year ago and I&#39;m hooked.  You&#39;re pushing me ever so closer to following my gut and going into independent journalism.  It scares me but I feel this is a calling, but every time I see something in the news that I have no idea about I have to spend all day reading up on it.  It begs the question, How can anyone possibly know all the information needed to form a coherent picture of events and happenings? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Short answer: We will never have all the information we need and that&#39;s a brass ring that we have to stop chasing. I truly believe in the power of open source communities to assemble/process/edit information more reliably than any individual could, and that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to create with the Corbett Report community. For more on the concept of &quot;Open Source Journalism&quot; see my presentation at the 2013 fOSSa conference:</p>

<p>The beast is a hydra with many heads, and the secret to defeating the beast is not to cut off the head but to stop its heart. We are the heart, and we pump the blood through its system by our participation in it. We must remove ourselves from the system in order to defeat it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello James, You&#39;re doing excellent work.</p>

<p>Seems I missed the window by about 10 hours, which makes me sad but I&#39;ll ask my questions anyway. Since this post is stickied, perhaps you&#39;ll return sometime during the week as axolotl_peyotl requested.</p>

<p>So my question is;</p>

<p>What are your opinions on:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Agenda 21 - How will/has it affected Canada, and more importantly, the entire world?</p></li>
<li><p>The NDAA - And whether any such similar bill was passed in Canada? (I believe there was one but the name escapes me and I&#39;m not positive if it entails the exact horrors that the American one does.)</p></li>
<li><p>Social media - And the affect it&#39;s had on the growth of the truth movement. I believe Social Media will retain a great deal of importance with the future of the truth movement and indeed the entire world, similar to how it did with the Arab Spring, and Hong Kong protests. Only it will (hopefully) be less violent.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In any case, keep up the good work.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT;</strong> Words, grammar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi James, thanks so much for joining us today and thank you for all of the work that you have done. </p>

<p>The standards of journalism surrounding the conspiracy world seem to be constantly in flux, and, are perhaps more a testament to the lack of established professionalism in the industry than anything else; and while this lack of centralized and monetized professionalism brings with it little corruption is also tends to attract widely varied standards of content souring. </p>

<p>In this regard I wonder where you see yourself in regards to upholding journalistic standards in an arena that is often times marred by speculation and mis/disinformation?</p>

<p>As an addendum to this question; what are your thoughts on the work of Bill Cooper and how do you compare his style to that of Alex Jones? </p>

<p>The point of the Non-GMO Project and other such initiatives is that it allows us a way to share and crowdsource information that neither the corporation nor the government has any interest in sharing with us.

    <div class="md"><p>To clarify &quot;right to know&quot; -
Its just one of the arguments  <em>for</em> labelling products containing GMOs in the United States. While I agree that it is &quot;mystical&quot; in nature, the <a href="http://righttoknow-gmo.org/mission">&quot;right to know&quot;</a> is used as a rallying cry to gain support for legislated GMO labelling. The Non-GMO Project is trying to create an unofficial but authoritative standard by which our foods can be &quot;verified&quot;. Which is awesome. I&#39;m really interested in the difference it makes to consumers when the only organized GMO labelling system that we have is a crowdsourced &quot;Non-GMO&quot; versus a government-regulated &quot;GMO&quot;.</p>

<p>Do you ever see GMO labels in Japan?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi,<br/>
There is a lot to talk about..  </p>

<p>As a scientist, I find disinformation on almost every topic.<br/>
There are many ways disinformation gets into science:<br/>
- commercialization of research.<br/>
- political influence on research.<br/>
- religious and atheistic influence on research.<br/>
- patents and other forms of legislation that makes research partially secret.<br/>
- witchhunting of people that do not agree with some research or models.<br/>
- influence on status and career.<br/>
- etcetera.  </p>

<p>Because science is seen by the public and scientists as a &quot;way to establish the truth&quot;, controlling science seems a perfect way for any intelligence agency to control the &quot;truth&quot;.<br/>
We can see in the old days, that science was used to support racism, support believe systems, and support all kinds of destructive political decisions. Hitler had his own group of scientists, and with them found the &quot;solution&quot;.   </p>

<p>So my question is about the controlling part of the scientific community, and that covers all topics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>James,</p>

<p>[Full disclosure, I posted a version of this comment to Richard Gage the other day and upon further reflection, think it&#39;s more deserving of your eyes and would appreciate any input]</p>

<p>I for one am no longer satisfied with being just knowledgeable and content with ‘knowing’ what really happened on 9/11 or JFK or pick your false flag du jour (as well as being disgusted by what these events have done to this country and planet with the cascade of events that have taken place), I am eager for change in our current system, but know full well that the pervasive effects of unlimited campaign financing effectively make those who are not career politicians with access to these types of monies, silenced.</p>

<p>By your estimation, what percentage of the American public who were affected by all of this <em>terrorism</em> agree with the above statements? I imagine we both agree that the current US politicians will never open a new, independent, criminal investigation for the events on 9/11 due to the taboo nature of the subject in American culture and dialogue.</p>

<p>A representative democracy or republic was meant initially as a system of government for regular people to serve their people, and it was regarded as a privilege. Career politicians will by default be diametrically opposed to how this system is supposed to work, as they are dependent on their campaign financiers to fund the PR machine required to keep them in power. With the advent of services such as kickstarter and indigogo, could your foresee a system where candidates are crowdfunded (and possibly unified by certain key issues), and legislation can be organized in an open-source manner? I believe if this is feasible, the time is NOW. I just love the way you always include source material in your show notes and feel at this stage technogically, there&#39;s no reason we can&#39;t have open-source legislation (and would be a fantastic campaign bullet, IMO).</p>

<p>With that being said (and I apologize for the lengthiness of the comment already), do you agree that at this point, the only real way for a new investigation to occur is for the US governmental system to be repaired? For this, the only remedy I can imagine is a complete reboot, with career politicians being voted out and individuals free of the shackles of corporate money replacing them, who will finally be able to represent their constituents properly, and who can open a new criminal investigation, and slowly roll back the legislative behemoth implemented in the 13 years since 9/11 (and since it&#39;s inception in the 1780s, but that&#39;s an entirely different story). In my view, this can only be established by motivated citizens who are unhappy with the status quo, and are willing to unite with others who may not agree politically or ideologically on what the mainstream media state as ‘major issues,’ for the greater good.</p>

<p>Could you see this happening? Again, thank you for all that you do for those that are unable to speak out for fear of being socially ostracized and difficult to employ in certain fields (I am in American academia myself). Thank you for your contributions.</p>

<p>All the best,</p>

<p>Jim</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tl;DR: I will pay for and help you set up https:// (SSL) for your website so that you can prevent the NSA and ilk from harvesting information and from profiling the relatively popularity of your content and collecting all your users&#39; passwords and comments.</p>

<p>Mr Corbett, please set up SSL for your website!
Your subscribers are currently not safe from the all-seeing eye of the panopticon -- the technical security term for it is a Global Adversary (pun not intended). Anyone listening on the wire will know who is logging in from where, what passwords they&#39;re using on your site, what their email addresses are, what comments they write, which articles and podcasts are more popular than others -- basically, the entire interaction between your server and your subscribers is open to a global adversary passively collecting all the unencrypted data.</p>

<p>None of the above mentioned things are possible if you set up your server with HTTPS. It&#39;ll cost you around $20 to buy a certificate, and a little bit of time to set it up. I will pay for your certificate, I can help you in any way to set up nginx (the web server program corbettreport.com currently uses) -- I could do it for you, or guide you through it, or offer a place to find guidance -- that depends on your level of comfort. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve talked many times about things we, as individuals, can do to fight The Powers That Shouldn&#39;t Be. The stuff Snowden hung out, limited though it may be, clarified for us techies what needs to be done to secure this net we&#39;ve got between us. Strong cryptography always wins over the panopticon. This only defends you from passive spying, security from targeter attack costs a lot more, and I can&#39;t help you much in that regard. But SSL/TLS stops the passive panopticon dead.</p>

<p>I would really like to start participating in the discussions on your site, but I recognize that it is not safe for me to do so. The same applies to your current subscribers. Without a secure connection, neither you nor they have any idea who is listening at the other end, and if they&#39;re messing with the data. 
You know how you have that problem of audio streams sometimes getting interrupted? How do you know someone isn&#39;t messing with the connection mid-stream? (Such things are called man-in-the-middle attacks.) If you used TLS/SSL (properly set up), you&#39;d have complete mathematical certainty that nobody is snooping on the wire, and nobody is messing with the data along the way.</p>

<p>So please, please do it. I&#39;ve sent you a message about this before. Strong cryptography is a necessary precondition for the ability to make meaningful choices on the web. I&#39;ll pay for the whole thing and then some. (The same offer goes for BFP, they have unsecured logins just like you).</p>

<p>Thank you for reading my wall-o-text, and thank you for your work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi James:</p>

<p>Kolin Evans.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<p>Q1.
To what degree do you think Reddit is flawed as an &quot;information platform&quot; if any?</p>

<p>Q2
What&#39;s your take on this exchange between Karen Hudes and Bill Still ?</p>

<p>in which Karen states Bill is </p>

<p>&quot;working for the other side&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/KarenHudes/status/528970642725818372">https://twitter.com/KarenHudes/status/528970642725818372</a></p>

<p>Which started with a video about the coveted &quot;Asian elders&quot; which sounds very similar to the narrative of the &quot;World Gold trust&quot; in which Karen Hudes describes herself as :</p>

<p>&quot;Acting General Counsel of World Bank and Legal Counsel Global Debt Facility TVM-LSM-666&quot;  ( see link to convo)</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/KarenHudes/status/529090160110338049">https://twitter.com/KarenHudes/status/529090160110338049</a></p>

<p>Q3
Any comments on the idea that A. it exists and B. there is going to be any &quot;global reset&quot; on a &quot;Gold base&quot;, in which supposedly Gold is returned to the &quot;people of the world&quot;?</p>

<p>Q4 
How do you think the NDB (new Dev Bank) and the AIIB (Asian Inf Inv Bank) would be effected in this event and to a degree could this be related to the other side of that equation?  (if at all real) </p>

<p>** Just to be clear I don&#39;t know anyone else that understands the important of control of issuance as Bill Still and they are not my comments or opinions, i&#39;m just asking the questions.</p>

<p>** equally if you have covered this in a video or pod cast feel free to link. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey James,</p>

<p>Thank you so much for doing this AMA! I&#39;ve followed your work for years and you were one of the first people I found online after reading Crossing The Rubicon (Michael C. Ruppert for those unfamiliar) freshman year of college in 2007 and having that book forever change my outlook on a number of big things. It&#39;s pretty wild when a book can fundamentally transform your understanding of the world.</p>

<p>Speaking of books, I&#39;m curious which books you consider to be the best or most important in the realm of politics, history, 9/11 truth, or conspiracy stuff in general. These could be new, or old, or on specific topics, or very broad in scope. I&#39;m sure you read a fair amount, so which books would you throw on a list like this?</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mr. Corbett,</p>

<p>The official version of the 9/11 story is most obviously false; and you&#39;ve done a wonderful job at highlighting the inconsistencies and nonsense which surround that version of events.</p>

<p>That said, what do you feel actually occured on that day?</p>

<p>Was this a case, like Pearl harbor, where American authorities knew of an impending attack and simply facilitated it&#39;s success to further their strategic aims (specifically the aims of The Project for a New American Century?</p>

<p>Or was there something much more involved, and much more nefarious at play? </p>

<p>-- why did you move to japan</p>

    <div class="md"><p>2nd question (before the first is answered, pure greed alert:)</p>

<p>Peter Dale Scott is the most notable alt-research authority digging into workings of so-called &#39;Continuity of Government-&#39; doubtless you&#39;re pretty current on this and know that these procedures went into effect for the first time on 9/11/01.  It is his thesis that this legal/political paradigm has been in effect ever since and that the US Constitution has been, in large part, effectively superseded.  Have you done much in the way of looking into this?  Do we have any concrete / trail of breadcrumbs type evidence to suggest that the private, &#39;secret&#39; legal rationale of the 21st century White House is that the Constitution simply does not apply anymore, and any references to it are for PR / quieting the herd purposes only?  </p>

<p>For my part, I always think of the scene in Jeremy Scahill&#39;s &quot;Dirty Wars&quot; of Sen. Ron Wyden, looking a million years old, with some off-screen handler telling him what he can and can&#39;t say, remarking that &#39;if Americans knew the private legal interpretations of the White House, they&#39;d be horrified.&#39;  Thanks if you can get to this.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi James, I came here late but was sure glad <a href="/u/sheasie">/u/sheasie</a> got the limited hangout question in... (he doesnt think snowden&#39;s documents are LH)</p>

<p>So, as creator and spiritual leader, kidding, of <a href="/r/LimitedHangouts">/r/LimitedHangouts</a> ... I&#39;m Obviously going to ask about it</p>

<p>1) Have you heard of <a href="/r/LimitedHangouts">/r/LimitedHangouts</a> ? If not, I would say its the &quot;premier spot&quot; on reddit that questions the official story on Snowden</p>

<p>2) What&#39;s the goal of Snowden, if he is limited hangout</p>

<p>I have my personal opinion, that he&#39;s designed to instill the &quot;Digital Panopticon&quot; idea in all of us... which, their goal is for a chilling effect so we self-censor ourselves. Another Fear Tactic.</p>

<p><strong>Do you agree that that&#39;s the primary goal?</strong></p>

<p>Others think its a CIA-NSA turf war, or to distract us ( tarpley thought it was to distract from syria ), or it&#39;s to discourage us from looking deeper since Snowden holds the &quot;keys to the kingdom&quot;</p>

<p>I believe its a Fear thing to target 3 groups of Americans</p>

<p>A) The masses- Let americans know they are being watched </p>

<p>B) Potential Whistle-blowers- To discourage them from blowing the whistle, to show them what happens (espionage act)</p>

<p>C) Journalists- To discourage them from acutally doing their job (james risen)</p>

<p>3) Why don&#39;t you write an article saying Snowden&#39;s docs are limited hangout? </p>

<p>Thank you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>James you seem to shy away from some topics which I believe have plenty of evidence of fakery like the Boston bombing, LAX shooting, Elliot Rodger etc.  Is it just because you haven&#39;t spent the time researching or do you feel you may lose credibility no matter what evidence exists?

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, looks like I&#39;m going to have to send you some proof..  (eg. Boston has some people who clearly have no wounds or torn clothes until later photos).   I guess when you say government stages events you mean they organize real events and yes I&#39;m sure they do sometimes but I think it&#39;s a whole lot more likely they would fake deaths instead of actually kill for certain agendas like gun control and it&#39;s not that hard to imagine how the victims could be created.</p>

<p>Maybe you&#39;ve been turned off by all the speculation and 100% EXPOSED videos in the early stages of these events, it typically takes a few weeks before any decent evidence comes through.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s the added benefit of creating strife and division even within &quot;conspiracy circles&quot;.  Some people see the fakery, others, for whatever reason, aren&#39;t convinced - and we sit here arguing over whether the event was &quot;real&quot; or &quot;staged&quot; or &quot;allowed to happen&quot; or any other number of things while the agenda pushes ahead without us.</p>

<p>Edit:  Also I agree with you that all of these things are pretty blatant scams, the &quot;ebola outbreak&quot; included.  I had to just laugh when I saw all of those signs being hung up all over Liberia saying, &quot;EBOLA IS REAL.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is bothering me, when you say you don&#39;t believe in the fakery, are you referring to those events I mentioned or in general? because there&#39;s a lot of footage of people faking death and injury in Syria and more recently ebola in Africa.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is my opinion that &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; thinking is becoming more mainstream. It seems more and more people are understanding how rigged everything is and questioning things like 9/11 and the fed don&#39;t produce the bug eyes in people they used to. Do you think this is occurring, that the general populace is starting to &quot;wake up&quot; to some basic things, and, regardless of your answer, can you expand on it? Thanks for taking the time to do this!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>!!! Almost forgot about this. Long time listener here, but I jumped into your podcasts about halfway in, somewhere around episode 100 I think? 
Anyway, I&#39;ve cherrypicked a few podcasts as time allowed, and I noticed you sometimes repeat the same topics with new info, and as you yourself admit, the earliest episodes are almost embarassing.
Despite that, I want to pick up on episodes I&#39;ve missed throughout, essentially &quot;marathoning&quot; your podcasts.
So I&#39;d like to know, where do you personally think I should start with the podcasts in order to get the best quality?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been watching you on and off for the past few years now, and I&#39;m increasingly curious when you are going to put together a high-level overview of the current &quot;State of the Union&quot;. Has this been proposed to you before?</p>

<p>One other question: In Century of Enslavement, at the end when you begin to discuss alternatives, why did you neglect the variation where we keep the current fiat fraction reserve system but move it under congress. A scary thought, I know, but to me the key issue is that the constitution says it&#39;s something congress should be responsible for, and pragmatically, FRB isn&#39;t going anywhere any time soon. </p>

<p>Basically, I want to see more discussion revolving around the constitution. For example the deep state the Peter Dale Scott references and Continuity of Government programs.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>James, thanks so much for doing an AMA. I have been following you for around 4 years and I love your material. I really respect and admire your work ethic and you inspire me to research more about a wide array of topics that I never knew I would have been interested in. </p>

<p>My question has to do with how we can actually make a change. Since I think I can safely assume you would identify as an AnCap or voluntaryist, I don&#39;t need to expound on the profundity of the simple fact that the state is the monopoly on law. I bring this up because I think that it is relatively futile to use state legalese to try and bring down the state apparatus itself.</p>

<p>On <a href="http://www.corbettreport.com/corbett-report-radio-114-the-cafr-swindle/">episode 114</a> of your Corbett Report Radio show, you touch on the topic of Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports or CAFRs. After much research, I have come to the conclusion that CAFRs may be the way to actually expose the state and local governments as the racketeering schemes they are since the are official government documents.</p>

<p><strong>Basically as a tl;dr, what is your opinion on the CAFRs and do you think that more awareness about them can catalyze some real change as laws can be used to regain the money through Tax Retirement Accounts ala Walter Burien that has been funneled by the ultra elite to offshore tax havens?</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the question. Firstly, I don&#39;t believe laws are the conduit to real change. Secondly, there was an important thread on the Tragedy and Hope forum debating the merits of the CAFR argument that helped to persuade me that some of the claims about CAFR are overblown. Unfortunately it&#39;s a member-only forum so I can&#39;t dig up the link for you, but perhaps I will explore the topic in a future podcast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for responding, I really value your opinion. </p>

<p>I need to try and find that thread link because I have had conversations with CPA&#39;s and surprisingly, few of them had ever even heard of the CAFR let alone be willing to be objective in their analysis of the reports. I would love to hear you expound on CAFRs again, just give me a shout out when you do :)!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely seperate question here:
On the topic of Bitcoin, if Bitcoin has the potential to supersede popular currencies, what&#39;s stopping TPTShouldn&#39;tB from simply buying up all Bitcoins and effectively taking them out of circulation? 
And if this is indeed something that can happen, why hasn&#39;t it? 
At the risk of giving the elites the power they want us to think they have, might there to be alternate motives at play here? Subversion of known systems to squeeze in world-government infrastructure or something of the sort?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We just celebrated the 58th anniversary of the Hungarian Uprising and what we are told - the &#39;official version&#39; - still doesn&#39;t make sense. The Russians only needed Hungary as a supply route to their Red Army divisions in Austria and as soon as the Austrian State Treaty was signed on May 15, 1955, they dismantled the border lock on the Austro Hungarian border, picked up their land-mines and started to withdraw from <em>both Austria and Hungary</em>. By October, 1956, almost all Soviet personnel left Hungary, and then the Suez Crisis happened and &quot;we had a revolution&quot;. Returning Soviet troops, according to my relatives, thought they were in Egypt. Having heard of Gladio and Gladio B, I can&#39;t help but think that &quot;our revolution&quot; wasn&#39;t really ours. What is your take on these events?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>James, 
Do you have hope? Do you see a future without oligarchy and what does that future look like? I have heard the Zeitgeist folks and the communist types and the new age promises but I do not see a path to the place they describe, nor am I sure their versions of utopia are really all that great. Where do you look for this kind of inspiration? I tend to agree with Bucky Fuller in that If you don&#39;t like a thing don&#39;t fight it but rather build a new paradigm  rendering it obsolete. What is that paradigm for you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the question, but I think this is a reductive premise whose logical conclusion would be that ridding the world of Zionist Jews would rid the world of evil. This is cartoon politics. There are absolutely Zionist Jews in positions of power in the globalist schema, but the full scale of the problem involves playing different factions off of each other to achieve the synthesis of global government, which is the real goal and driving ideology.</p>

<p>The beast is a hydra with many heads, and the secret to defeating the beast is not to cut off the head but to stop its heart. We are the heart, and we pump the blood through its system by our participation in it. We must remove ourselves from the system in order to defeat it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow.  Shots fired.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin - It so happens that I, actually, am a big fan of Media Roots Radio, and have listened to all of the broadcasts thereof that can still be gotten from iTunes / Soundcloud.  Your Kurt Haskell interview, your report on Bin Laden&#39;s death, &#39;9/11: How We All Became Boiled Frogs,&#39; your exposure of the rebranding of PNAC by snakes like Jamie Kirchick et al - these are among my favorite pieces of alternative journalism.  Abby&#39;s Gitmo report was really moving.   I think &#39;American Anthrax&#39; was a stellar production - it&#39;s one of my favorite &#39;introductory rabbit hole&#39; docs for the newly initiated - &#39;here; this is one we know for sure is total bullshit and this guy has documented it.&#39;  So let&#39;s get that on the table, going in.  </p>

<p>It is, in fact, my respect for both your careers, rather than the lack thereof, that has led to my dismay &amp; critical commentary regarding much of the tone of your recent work wrt 9/11.  I must stand by it; I do not believe it &#39;distortion&#39; or &#39;misinformation&#39; at all to point out how Abby has, repeatedly and specifically, mentioned her &#39;self-distancing&#39; from the 9/11 truth movement; how the use of the word &#39;conspiracy&#39; to mean &#39;marginal or dismissable view&#39; has begun to creep into your reportage (see:  Gitmo episode) or that, when asked flat out by Joe Rogan, Abby made a meek reply about how she &#39;still had questions but couldn&#39;t say it was an inside job&#39; - a stunning statement, coming from a woman who has participated in hundreds of hours of documentation and analysis that screams for just that conclusion.  </p>

<p>I do not make these remarks without sympathy.  In my observation, Abby has been perhaps the most sandwiched and rag-dolled figure in the entire alt-media universe, particularly in recent years.  As someone who clearly thinks a lot about &#39;finding a broader audience&#39; and &#39;making a mass difference&#39; - very much the extrovert - she has ironically had to deal with a more diverse constellation of hostility than maybe anyone else in her field:  howls from the FPI shills of the world denouncing her as a &quot;Kremlin puppet&quot; (God, I could go on all day about the RT America / PressTV phenomenon and what it <em>really</em> represents, and it ain&#39;t &quot;Kremlin shills&quot;); snide remarks from strongman-worshippers like Webster Tarpley about her &#39;Putin-slandering narcissism&#39; for having the moral courage to speak out against her network&#39;s interests; the fickle vagaries of the up-and-down fads of the 9/11 truth movement (&#39;gatekeeper!  gatekeeper!&#39; - and here I am now; et tu, anacardo?) and, always, an endless parade of drooling bros packing every comments section, fetishizing her for her beauty.  </p>

<p>I am not insensitive to these pressures or what they must do - her emotional response to her Gitmo experiences, her obvious relief at being <em>appreciated</em>, was very moving, and, speaking personally, I have my own sister, herself a huge extrovert and world-class charmer whom I also tend to idolize.  That sympathy does not, to my mind, dim the necessity I feel to point out these dangerous flirtations with the boundaries of truth and integrity in the name of accessibility or reaching a broader audience.  </p>

<p>Many times on MR, you have discussed your frustrations &amp; conflicted feelings with the need for the compromise of ideals in order to spread the word, and I would point out that there is such a thing as a balance too far.  To Abby, I would paraphrase another of the tragically-underrepresented female voices in the alt-media movement, Catherine Austin Fitts, a woman who has suffered greatly for her work - as for the place humanity is going, there isn&#39;t ultimately going to be any room for staying in the middle; for understanding the beast, but trying to compromise with it to get along.  </p>

<p>You may sniff at such pronouncements from someone who has made zero original contributions to the cause of truth and liberty, who has authored no work, made no original investigations, placed his reputation on the line nowhere beyond the confines of reddit, and generally not given even a fraction of the blood, sweat and tears that you and your sister have; you would be right.  Yet I feel I must stand by them.</p>

<p>This is hardly the way I would have ever preferred to be &#39;introduced&#39; to Robbie Martin, someone who, like James Corbett, has struck me as &#39;my kind of guy&#39; from the moment of my introduction to his work; nor do I feel terribly comfortable in adding to an enormous tangent from what IMO has been an outstanding AMA, but given the circumstances, I feel I must make a comprehensive and public reply.  </p>
