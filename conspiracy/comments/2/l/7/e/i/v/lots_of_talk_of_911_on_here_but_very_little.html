    <div class="md"><p>Compared to 9/11 - they were significantly more crisp with their delivery of the narrative that day.</p>

<p>Remember - this was 12 years after 9/11, so their newly established DHS had 12 years to become trained, run drills, and integrate with local police departments. <strong>Coincidentally, they were running drills that day of multiple bombings.</strong></p>

<p>There was also no mentioning of these guys at the scene at all, despite their backpacks looking <em>remarkably similar</em> to pictures of the &#39;pressure cooker bomb bags.&#39;</p>

<p>Exploded bag:</p>

<p>As to your question, OP - a lot of us here don&#39;t talk about it either because we already did the research 18 months ago as it happened live and Boston used it as an excuse to do a door-to-door military exercise, locking down a major US city, and successfully conditioning the American people that those armor-plated vehicles are a good idea <em>just in case</em> (#bostonstrong).</p>

<p>Or maybe that&#39;s just why I don&#39;t talk about it - it&#39;s depressing to relive it.</p>

<p>I hope that helps.</p>

<p>I never really thought of this - and it&#39;s a great point. Looking at my 14-year-old nephew - I&#39;m sure he feels this way. If only there was an appropriate way to bring up <strong>the biggest terror attack in the history of the US</strong> without being a social pariah...</p>

<p>Great points! I have used these events successfully as wedges to get people to start questioning things. But it has to come up organically in conversation to have any effect.</p>

<p>I disagree. The problem with the Craft Guys is there is still no valid excuse for ex-Seal Team Three, now private civic mercenaries (think Blackwater/Xe/Academi) be doing, <em>deployed</em>, at the Boston Marathon in 2013? Isn&#39;t that a valid concern? I&#39;d love to know why my government is paying private contractor mercs. Because they don&#39;t really have any loyalty, do they? I mean, they&#39;re mercs.</p>

<p>And of course there&#39;s that ridiculous photo which I won&#39;t link that shows the team hanging out at the intersection in front of a black van, with blue and red arrows everywhere. It&#39;s a silly photo that I don&#39;t think really adds to the argument and only serves to distract.</p>

<p>the &#39;Florida&#39; photo of the younger brother walking down the sidewalk after the second &#39;bomb&#39;.</p>

<p>whats interesting is what the full photo shows, who else is in the photo, the grinning idiot.</p>

<p>a certain senior marketing manager of a Boston branch of a big marketing company.</p>

<p>the dude has at least two bodyguards shielding him.</p>

<p>then up by the &#39;bomb&#39; sites are various assorted pairs of grey hoodie dudes wearing sunglasses and totally out of place at a sports event.</p>

<p>miserable overcast April day and everybody wears fcuking sunglasses like its mid August !?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are either part of the agenda or willingly ignorant. There are so many holes in the story its downright absurd. Whoever the director is in the red shirt and glasses should be fired or demoted to actor. But they have done a few things right and one of them being that the lie is so big no one would ever believe it could be untrue. Boston Strong, Newtown Strong, Ottawa Strong? Really? I hope you donated some of your hard earned money to the &quot;victims&quot;. Especially to the guy in the wheelchair with his fake legs and the lack of blood that should be squirting all over the place. Does the blood clot that quickly when your FLIPPIN LEGS are blown off? Its comical bro. Did you see the lady that ran across the entire seen with her bandages already on and then laid down? One of the better ones. Or all the glass that should have been blown into the building and not out on the sidewalk? Or the fact that no one lost any arms or head? And yeah, I usually carry a strap in my hoodie too, just in case Im in a bomb situation and someones leg gets blown off yo. At least you are willing to admit the guy pulled a strap from his flippin hoodie - right where I keep mine ;) Haha!  I like your style. </p>

<p>This sub tracked the photos of the Craft guys and interesting backpacks. That arab student thing didn&#39;t originate from this sub at all. In fact, how it was portrayed on mass media and the big subs on this site led me to believe it was simply a bullshit story (not saying some kid didn&#39;t die, but when the media starts howling on something in unison, you know fuckery is afoot) engineered to discredit the community on reddit and other social media platforms as a whole. <em>Calm down, children, you&#39;re not sleuths, and now look, this porr kid is DEAD, tsk tsk...</em></p>

<p>A lot of people were not falling for the flashbangs and talcum powder, and they needed a decisive story to smear in the faces of those who were picking apart the FBI&#39;s bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>how about this. ill keep my ignorant mouth shut about football, fantasy football, FIFA and pro wrestling</p>

<p>if you keep your ignorant mouth shut about actual news and events.</p>

<p>i see your account is only 3 months old. so basically you are like the guy who walks into a movie theater half way through a movie and loudly asks &quot;What Did I Miss?&quot; and expects everyone else to drop what they are doing, distract themselves from paying attention to what is happening next, just to bring your ignorant ass up to speed.</p>

<p>so, how about instead of being that guy, you decide to sit it out and just wait for the next movie to start, because you will never fully understand what everyone else already knows is going on by tuning in halfway through. actual news is a little more complex to watch and comprehend than football, but at least your kinda trying, right? its unfortunate that you were too busy watching football to pay attention to actual news, but its not really anyone else&#39;s responsibility to explain to you what you missed. </p>

<p>This would be an exercise in futility, because you are not going to agree with anything anybody tells you on this sub, are you?</p>
