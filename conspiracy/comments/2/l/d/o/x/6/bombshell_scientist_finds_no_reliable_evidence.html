<blockquote>
<p>I recently had an exchange of emails with David Rasnick, PhD.</p>

<p>You can read Rasnick’s bio at his site, davidrasnick.com. He obtained his PhD from the Georgia Institute of Technology, and spent 25 years working with proteases (a class of enzymes) and protease inhibitors. He is the author of the book, The Chromosomal Imbalance Theory of Cancer. He was a member of the Presidential AIDS Advisory Panel of South Africa.</p>

<p>The subject of our conversation was the isolation of the Ebola virus from humans. Has it ever been done?</p>

<p>Direct isolation is far different from diagnostic tests such as antibody or PCR, which are both indirect methods of assessment. In previous articles, <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/10/06/the-ebola-test-let-the-tests-inventor-speak/">I’ve covered the irrelevance of these two tests.</a></p>

<p>Any discussion of the Ebola virus must begin with the question of direct isolation. <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/11/03/ebola-hoax-my-foia-request-to-the-cdc/">The whole presumption of an Ebola outbreak and epidemic rests on that question.</a></p>

<p>Was the Ebola virus ever purified and isolated from a human?</p>

<p>Here is what Rasnick wrote, after his search of the published literature:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“I have examined in detail the literature on isolation and Ems [EM: electron microscope pictures] of both Ebola and Marburg viruses. I have not found any convincing evidence that Ebola virus (and for that matter Marburg) has been isolated from humans. There is certainly no confirmatory evidence of human isolation.</p>

<p>“I searched the CDC’s website and came up dry. The CDC claims 7728 Ebola virus cases have been ‘laboratory-confirmed’.</p>

<p>“I asked the CDC what constitutes isolation of Ebola virus from human specimens. I also asked for the protocol for isolating Ebola virus. [No reply from the CDC as of this date.] Virtually everything that is known and done with these viruses is in animals and cell culture.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rasnick continued:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“There is the possibility that Ebola and Marburg viruses represent laboratory artifacts. I’m inclined to think this is the case. What I mean is the viruses are real but may exist at very low levels in wild animals and even humans, well-below pathogenic [disease-causing] levels. These ‘passenger’ viruses may be activated and amplified in laboratory culturing conditions designed for that purpose in order to produce enough viral particles to be characterized.</p>

<p>“Viruses causing real pathology are abundant in the diseased tissues. You can see them using EM on the primary tissue. You do not need to amplify the virus in cell culture. I’m always suspicious when cell culture is the only way a virus is observable by EM.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rasnick’s findings are a direct challenge to the basis of the whole “Ebola outbreak.” If indeed the Ebola virus has never been isolated from a human being, the so-called epidemic is unproven.</p>

<p>To say this is shocking would be a vast understatement.</p>

<p>When public-health officials and governments claim there is an epidemic, the burden of proof is on them.</p>

<p>At this point, they must, first and foremost, show someone, somewhere, correctly and directly and undeniably isolated Ebola virus from a human being.</p>

<p>Let’s see the evidence. Now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a friend who is from an ebola stricken country of Africa who has family over there, and she has spoken to them about this problem several times. She said that doctors who try and speak out about how much of this is either fake, or someone high up is causing this ebola scare gets murdered. She knows of two doctors that have gotten murdered so far. I recently read something about how it might not even be ebola thats causing the sickness and death over there but a tainted water supply that produces ebola like symptoms. The whole thing is very fishy. No one from her country had ever heard of ebola, more specially her city/providence until a few months ago. Now they have the population over there scared shitless according to her family back home. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to be. A little logic and a little common sense is all that is required to put two and two together. If the scientists can not trace the origin of Ebola back to a human then the disease isn&#39;t human. That leaves the door open to other possibilities. And before you say &quot;It came from Monkeys&quot;...don&#39;t. The scientists are, by implication, ruling that out too. </p>

<p>It is a psy-op, plain and simple.  Just another in a long line of them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny how the &quot;ebola outbreak&quot; rhetoric died down almost completely these last couple of days, just in time for all of the election talk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do they propose the agent is that caused all these deaths, chicken pox?  Ebola and Marburg both cause massive cell death and can be found in samples of destroyed human liver and spleen tissue in huge amounts as well as in the testicles and blood.  This is not something that is difficult to find or can escape notice, it is present in the blood in amounts exceeding 10 billion virus particles per milliliter (see Jaax, Jaahrling, Geisbert, Belanov, Bray, Osterholm, Piot et al.)</p>

<p>When inoculated with Ebola infected fluids, macaques and other lab animals including swine develop fulminating hemorrhagic fever that quickly kills.  The same agent is present in huge amounts in their fluids and organs are destroyed in the same way.</p>

<p>The test on blood samples is PCR or polymerase chain reaction which reacts in the presence of filovirus antibodies and furthermore is substrain specific, ie a Zaire test will not react for Sudan, Reston, bundibugyo, etc.</p>

<p>Before claims like this can be taken seriously, the people making the claim need to produce some other etiologic agent capable of producing such tissue destruction.  Claiming a substance present in samples in amounts so large (10,000,000,000 particles per CC!?) is an &quot;artifact&quot; is frankly ludicrous and an insult to the intelligence of the reader as well as to the numerous virologists who have worked with, tested and observed this pathogen for nearly fifty years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did the problem is there is so much emotional attachment to the theory of HIV/AIDS because they hear all the propaganda in the media and they see people who are &#39;HIV sufferers&#39;, so many doctors over the years and so many peer reviewed papers confirm the study of HIV/AIDS however there is not a single peer reviewed paper which has isolated it hence the rewards.</p>

<p>I get castigated every time I question this to people as if I&#39;m the devil. I just want to get to the truth and see what is the cause of their weak immune system and low T-Cell count. There are plenty of people that are HIV+ but are cured.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ebola hoax: my FOIA request to the CDC</p>

<p>Today, I sent a Freedom of Information Act request to the CDC (Note: On startpage.com, search for “CDC Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Requester Service Center”).</p>

<p>For those of you who’ve been reading my articles about Ebola (<a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/category/ebola/">archived here</a>), it’ll be self-explanatory:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“This is a request for published records, data, studies, electron microscope photographs, work notes, and internal correspondence relating to and describing, in detail, the direct isolation of the Ebola virus from human beings.</p>

<p>“Note: My request does not seek information on this subject which is derived from antibody tests, PCR tests, or virus cultured and grown outside the human body. Nor does it seek electron microscope photographs which are, in fact, simulations or the result of computer models.</p>

<p>“I am, however, seeking electron microscope photos of diseased human tissue.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That’s it.</p>

<p>Of course, I’m not holding my breath. I have no expectations.</p>

<p>But people need to be aware that this is an issue. A vital issue.</p>

<p><a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/10/22/the-ebola-hoax-questions-answers-and-the-false-belief-in-the-one-it/">Disease hoaxes start at square one, where the fundamental assumptions are made.</a> And one of the first assumptions is: humans who are labeled with a germ-caused disease house that germ in their bodies.</p>

<p>This seems like a tautology. But it isn’t, because there are cases in which an “outbreak” is promoted, and yet the virus which is said to be at the root of the outbreak can’t be found.</p>

<p>It can’t be found in the body. Or it can’t be found in sufficient quantity to cause disease.</p>

<p>Its presence and influence can only be inferred through faulty and/or deceptive means.</p>

<p>That’s why, in email correspondence with me, David Rasnick, PhD, announced this shocking finding:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“I have examined in detail the literature on isolation and Ems [EM: electron microscope pictures] of both Ebola and Marburg viruses. I have not found any convincing evidence that Ebola virus (and for that matter Marburg) has been isolated from humans. There is certainly no confirmatory evidence of human isolation.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unless and until I see convincing evidence to the contrary, that’s called a knockout punch.</p>

<p>you are implying understanding a virus (virus family) from a biological perspective makes you an intelligence authority on any conspiracy that might use a specific virus from the family for some unrelated (to the obvious) purpose. </p>

<p>Maybe your interest is in biology and not political/intelligence conspiracy?</p>

<p>Nothing of the sort.  I&#39;m implying that  we know very well what the etiologic agent of Ebola is.  It&#39;s the virus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trouble is, we can&#39;t do that because Ebola is highly contagious as well as representing a credible bioterrorism threat.</p>

<p>The fact that people like you don&#39;t trust the scientists who have worked with it for 40 years is irrelevant though, as is the opinion of aids denialists-- nobody rational cares what any of you think.</p>

<p>Also there&#39;s really no guess about it.  If you want to put your money where your mouth is, volunteer to be shot up with Ebola viruses to prove your point.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a denialist. I&#39;m advocating for more open science. But people like you are too busy pretending you know something to acknowledge that.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve simplified the actual issue into a completely misguided fantasy. We have an outbreak of something unprecedented. There are so many unknowns it would be careless and irresponsible to not organize a better effort in research. </p>

<p>Instead we fake scientists like yourself cheering on the CDC and their schizophrenic management of the outbreak. Yes.. let&#39;s not do research because terrorism. Good one.</p>

<p>The scope is unprecedented.  The etiologic agent is not, but may have undergone mutations since previous Zaire (350 mutations, effect unclear) and since May when the virus was last sequenced.  See Kobinger&#39;s latest research as well as the dr Osterholm lecture at Johns Hopkins, he raises some very disturbing questions.</p>

<p>You sound hysterical.  Ask yourself who is really schizophrenic.</p>

<p>The most hilarious thing ever is the claim by the Sirleaf regime that the disease has reversed.</p>
