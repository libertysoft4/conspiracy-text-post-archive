<p>Yes.  Good point.  However, what I mean is that this is the first time that Corbett has <em>directly addressed</em> the reddit community and said it to us in no uncertain terms.  We were <em>directly addressed</em> with the statement on his part.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>But isn&#39;t the information nothing new?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.  The information is indeed nothing new.  However, the information was previously given to the masses in a piecemeal, bit by bit method where various separate pieces of the overall puzzle would be released first in this MSM news broadcast, then in that newspaper outlet, then in this tv show, then in that movie...</p>

<p>All separate pieces bit by bit...</p>

<p>Problem is that, many of us being generally stupid sheeple, we didn&#39;t really put 2 and 2 together, so we STILL didn&#39;t get the hints that TPTB were at times <em>heavily</em> dropping.</p>

<p>That&#39;s when TPTB likely finally said &quot;Ohhhhhkay.  Damn.  These motherfuckers are really <em>that</em> stupid?  Really?  You mean we really have to spoon feed you motherfuckers the LITERAL truth?  Jesus fucking Christ.  Okay.  Bring in the stool pigeon.  Where&#39;s that Snowden cat?  Bring him in!&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does the public at large feel any more surveilled than before?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They do now.  And you know why?  Because Snowboy came in and said &quot;Ehem.  Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen of the United States.  I am here to officially tell you that TPTB are - yes - <em>officially spying on you.</em>  Be afraid.  Be <em>very</em> afraid.&quot;</p>

<p>And many citizens have followed suit very accordingly.</p>

<p>I guess you don&#39;t remember, but when the story first broke, Reddit in general - and this sub in particular - was up. in.  <em>arms</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Quite the opposite actually considering Bundy ranch and Ferguson.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Budy Ranch and Ferguson are not examples of the public not being afraid that Uncle Sam is surveilling them...in the least.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I haven&#39;t noticed people acting any less forthcoming with personal info since Snowden.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s because Snowden isn&#39;t an end all be all false flag.  He&#39;s only one piece on the chess board of PTB chicanery and manipulation.  Their plans are a <em>lot</em> deeper than just one person, and it&#39;s not like they&#39;re putting all there effort on only him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me break it down for you:</p>

<p>If you ask why before looking at the evidence, you won&#39;t be able to judge the veracity of the answers you get. You will have to accept or reject the answer based only on your ignorance of the subject. Wether you accept or reject, you still don&#39;t know anything about what happened. </p>

<p>The answer to &quot;why?&quot; only makes sense in the context of the evidence. So if you aren&#39;t familiar with the evidence, it&#39;s the wrong question to start asking. </p>

<p>Yes, I do believe Snowden is a limited hangout. Like every good limited hangout, it produces some good. i.e. the public becomes more broadly aware of some issue and some percentage of them follow the cookie trail down the rabbit hole (to mix a metaphor). But it also tells us nothing fundamentally new and obscures some very important aspects of the intelligence/surveillance complex, specifically the role of the CIA who Snowden &quot;used to&quot; work for and still claims allegiance to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I plan on doing an interview with Douglas Valentine on the CIA angle of the Snowden story in particular and a more in-depth podcast documenting the psyop in general, but in the meantime you can see this editorial I wrote for the International Forecaster:</p>

<p>And my work on &quot;the panopticon&quot; and the conditioning of the public to accept total surveillance:</p>
