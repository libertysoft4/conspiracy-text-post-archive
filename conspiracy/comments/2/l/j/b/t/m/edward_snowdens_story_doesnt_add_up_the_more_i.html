        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Playing devil&#39;s advocate here, I&#39;d say these few things make me wonder if Edward Snowden is really a rogue former intelligence employee, or, still part of the CIA, and leading a propaganda effort to focus dissent to an avenue that will go nowhere. Follow me here:</p>

<ul>
<li>white, male, aged 25-34, generic looking, relatable </li>
<li>his revelations, really, are of little or no importance, it&#39;s all old tech stuff</li>
<li>no meaningful policies have changed as a result</li>
<li>there was no information to put anyone in danger</li>
<li>the government has used his revelations as reasoning to legalize and enhance the their surveillance </li>
<li>surveillance is now easier. People trying to avoid detection have generally funneled their shit to Tor, which has no real evidence of security, and is funded by the gov&#39;t anyways.</li>
<li>the documents released by Snowden could have been documents made to be released-hence the corniness of some of them, the wild spy-story shit, all that stuff. You read the book and it&#39;s like reading a movie.</li>
<li>if the CIA wanted him dead, he&#39;d be dead in Russia or Hong Kong or wherever the hell he went.</li>
</ul>

<p>okay, so maybe that can all be explained, but this I cannot explain:</p>

<p>His girlfriend is living with him in Russia. That means one of two, very, very improbable things:</p>

<p>If Snowden is the real deal:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>she got to Russia, despite being under constant NSA surveillance. She got a passport, got a visa, bought tickets, boarded an international flight with no problems and no one noticed. Impossible. </p></li>
<li><p>or, all of the above did happen, and the NSA has tailed her to find Snowden&#39;s location. This is highly unlikely because Snowden would expect that, and so far, has proven himself masterful at avoiding the NSA and would never make such a huge mcsteak. It would be uncharacteristic of everything he&#39;s done so far.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If Snowden is NOT the real deal, and is still on the CIA payroll, then it all makes sense. The failure to release any real damaging information. Avoiding capture almost without effort. Him now enjoying a decent life in Russia with his girlfriend. Odd claims like not having the ability to get more information, oddball things like saying he encrypted it with no key, etc, etc. Who&#39;s to say, then, that the documents he is publishing are even real and not also planted by the intelligence agencies?</p>

<p>The only way Edward Snowden makes sense is IF he actually is still an intelligence agency operative. Otherwise, none of it adds up in the long run.</p>

<p>Also, we do have one comparison: Bradley Manning. Compare and contrast:</p>

<p>The people and release:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>manning: awkward, ugly transsexual nutjob, rotting in prison now. Provided a clusterfuck of classified, embarrassing emails and cables to Wikileaks, who in turn will forever be in hiding from the government. </p></li>
<li><p>Snowden: all American white guy. Friendly, too well spoken. Model girlfriend. Contacts an award winning filmmaker to make his debut. Provides a PowerPoint. Easily flees (to Russia?? The fuck-oh double agent for us). Girlfriend joins him shortly. Scores a book deal, gets a job, becomes an international celebrity and gets access to he deepest darkest hidden realms of those who would oppose us. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>The documents:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Manning: absolute clusterfuck of emails and cables. Embarrassing content. Current content. Put lives at risk. Exposed actual crimes the USA did.  It&#39;s 750,000 ugly, type text emails that are full of jargon that most people wouldn&#39;t understand anyways. It&#39;s hard to read. </p></li>
<li><p>Snowden: gorgeous power points and pdf&#39;s? A movie? Old &quot;secrets&quot; easily spelled out with big letters and illustrations even a child could understand? Nothing that could risk operations? No evidence of any US crimes committed by the government? No actionable legal information? Crazy sounding catchy acronyms? Full color brochures? The military doesn&#39;t do shit like that. Those documents were made for public release. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I agree, but the fact than <em>none</em> of his &#39;revelations&#39; are novel or significant is a bigger flag than the girlfriend.  All he did was announce the surveillance state by loudspeaker, for those who had so far missed the news or had failed to put the pieces together.  He is a symbol.</p>

<p>You forgot that the MSM loves him.  The story would be dead if they didn&#39;t want us to feel the reach of the government&#39;s dark intrusion into our lives.</p>

<p>9/11 was a NY MSM production, at least the selling of it.</p>

<p>I suspect they wanted to see who scurries for the dark corners when Snowden turned on the lights, whether or not their surveillance is that good.  the people that made security changes at this time look more suspicious than those that did nothing.  Kinda like watching which cars hit their brakes when they see a cop.</p>

They can&#39;t just cancel her passport or put her on the no fly list for being his girlfriend.  They haven&#39;t cancelled Glenn Greenwalds passport or out him on he no fly list.</p>

<p>Getting a visa is easy.  Of corse russia have her a visa.</p>

<p>I think there would be incentive for the US to let her go.  They can hope he tells her his plans and that she will let stuff slip to her family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, Snowden doesn&#39;t resemble a master spy. He worked for the CIA, not as an agent, but as a systems administrator. He&#39;s the IT guy at your work, not James Bond. He demonstrated capability with software, which lead to a job at the CIA, which led to contracting for the NSA. At no point was he a spy, the majority of people who work for the CIA aren&#39;t spies. </p>

<p>He&#39;s in way over his head but it seems to be working out for him. He&#39;s not a limited hangout, he&#39;s just a nerd who lives in Russia now.</p>

<p>But, this would harm them, not Snowden, so, there&#39;s that. </p>

<p>One step further:</p>

<p>Overnight, Snowden became a trusted underground IT security figure. Anyone looking to vete encryption goes to him. He&#39;s at all the major IT Security functions now, as an insider. Think about that. He gained instant credibility by a paranoid, hard to-puncture group....all without any real vetting. </p>

<p>ie black hat hackers, and as we all know, lots of them are on TLA payrolls after getting quietly busted for doing their hobby and getting caught.</p>

<p>the dude that fingered Manning was a TLA asset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being friends with someone on Snowden&#39;s &quot;team&quot; make this hard to say for me...but something <em>doesn&#39;t</em> add up!</p>

<p>I think he&#39;s CIA--COINTELPRO all the way. Come on...I have seen the US search ENTIRE COUNTRIES to perform &quot;extrajudicial renditions&quot; (kidnappings) on people that they wanted extradited back to US soil to stand trial--like hiding in an airport hotel is gonna REALLY throw off the US spooks, right?</p>

<p>This story smells bad in about 100 places. I&#39;ll hold judgement until I see CITIZENFOUR and go from there.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Snowden is NOT who/what he says that he is.</p>

<p>What better way to undermine someone and the content of their revelations than to say that they are emotionally unstable and wish to mutilate their own genitals.</p>

<p>Pretty powerful stuff if you think about it. </p>
