        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGtRzkNoEuM">Dorothy Thompson was an American journalist and radio broadcaster</a>, who in 1939 was recognized by Time magazine as the second most influential woman in America next to Eleanor Roosevelt.</p>

<p>Thompson was viciously attacked in an orchestrated campaign of what she termed “career assassination and character assassination.” She wrote: “It has been boundless, going into my personal life.”</p>

<p>Before long, her column and radio programs, her speaking engagements, and her fame were all gone. Today, she has largely been erased from history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s one of the ways posts are kept artificially low.  I don&#39;t know the exact mechanism but it&#39;s like you said - votes are either ignored or literally &quot;removed&quot; from the total.</p>

<p>This becomes particularly obvious on certain posts that will have 60-70 comments while only having 20 votes, for instance (which happens quite a lot if you actually pay attention to it).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it is obvious there was/is significant upvote shaving on this topic, I have been watching upvotes being shaved off this topic ever since I posted that I was going to keep a close eye on this post earlier today. All afternoon I have seen this topic gain a couple upvotes, then lose them a few minutes later. In just <em>today&#39;s</em> screenshots I have <strong>clear evidence of close to 50 upvotes being shaved from this topic</strong>, who knows how many more shaved upvotes went undocumented (I was not home for a couple hours, and I was not fully dedicated to watching every minute for what the votes were doing, so who knows how many more upvotes I could not get definitive proof of, my guess is quite a few more.)</p>

<p>At this point it is painfully obvious the reported vote totals on reddit cannot be relied upon to be accurate or real. I think this last week I have spent collecting evidence of voting fraud here poses just as many questions as it starts to answer.</p>

<p><strong>edit-</strong> ..lol, I just watched total upvotes drop from 125 to 122 and the post lost another 2 points (110 to 108)..lulz.</p>

<p><em>“American movie-distributors refused to become involved in the distribution and exhibition of the motion picture after the A.D.L. and others expressed the fear that the film was harmful; the Rank Organization withdrew the picture in the United States.” Later the picture was released after censorship by the A.D.L.; “seventy two eliminations” were made at its command and a prologue was added assuring beholders that they might accept it as “a filmization of Dickens without anti-semitic intentions.” (In occupied Berlin the A.D.L. ban was final; the British authorities ordered Dickens withdrawn from German eyes).</em></p>

<p><em>I was in America at this time and thus saw the fulfilment of a prediction made in a book of 1943, when I wrote that, as the secret censorship was going, Chaucer, Shakespeare and Dickens would one day be defamed as “anti-semites.” I thought to strain probability, to make a point, but it happened in all three cases: a Shakespearean actor-manager visiting New York was ordered not to play The Merchant of Venice, Dickens was banned, and the defamationists put Chaucer on their black-list.</em></p>

<p><em>A private organization which can produce such results is obviously powerful; there is nothing comparable in the world. Mr. Vincent Sheehan wrote in 1949, “There is scarcely a voice in the United States that dares raise itself for the rights, any rights, of the Arabs; any slight criticism of the Zionist high command is immediately labelled as anti-semitic.” Miss Dorothy Thompson, whose picture and articles at that time were published everyday in hundreds of newspapers, similarly protested. Mr. Sheehan&#39;s popularity with book-reviewers immediately slumped; Miss Thompson&#39;s portrait and writings are seldom seen in the American press today.</em></p>
