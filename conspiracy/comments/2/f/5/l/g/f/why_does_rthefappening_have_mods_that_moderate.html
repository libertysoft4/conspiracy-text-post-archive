<p>A subreddit that was created less than 24 hours ago for a specific event gave out moderator status to a bunch of so-called &quot;power users&quot;.  These people moderate a huge swath of subreddits including major subs.  Why are they given mod status seemingly by default?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve met a very high-profile Reddit moderator before.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t get the impression that they&#39;re conspiring to control the information on Reddit for its own sake. But they are by and large a group of people who are all friends and know each other. They talk to the admins. They have a set of norms that they&#39;ve settled on in terms of how and what they moderate.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not an active conspiracy. It&#39;s just the result of a few people having power over others and being a little elite clique to themselves.</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> He also talked about various massive Reddit controversies and explained why they were blown way, way out of proportion. I don&#39;t remember the details, but there are Redditors who have been socially crucified who did little to nothing wrong. Most of the mods are probably decent, though there are surely some power-hungry assholes in the group. It&#39;s more like average politics than an Illuminati conspiracy.</p>

<p>But that is precisely what most of us mean when we talk about conspiracies. We are talking about opaque or translucent, little-known or unknown power circles that can influence larger populations and who act mainly according to their own interests, which are sometimes systematically incentivized to do unethical things, and against the popular intuitions of how such people with such power out to ethically behave. </p>

<p>It is the <a href="/r/conspiratards">/r/conspiratards</a> that try to frame everything we talk about here as being about infallible unidentifiable magicians/aliens with super powers.</p>

<p>Okay and how can you possibly ever hope to prove that if there&#39;s no transparency with the moderators and admins here? How many times do we see huge swaths of threads and comments getting obliterated (Zoe Quinn is a good recent example)? </p>

<p>The people who ended up as Mods on <a href="/r/thefappening">/r/thefappening</a> wasn&#39;t done by design.. it was just an unintentional &quot;emergent-phenomenon&quot; of the fact that most of them share the same interests or Mod similar themed sub-reddits. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no &quot;hidden agenda&quot; to <a href="/r/thefappening">/r/thefappening</a> ....it&#39;s just a central dumping ground (or central discussion ground) for events related to celebrity-nudes. There&#39;s nobody Mod&#39;ing <a href="/r/TheFappening">/r/TheFappening</a> directly trying to influence how Members think or what they should believe,etc. </p>

<p><a href="/r/thefappening">/r/thefappening</a> isn&#39;t the result of any &quot;conspiracy&quot;.. it&#39;s just 1 facet (of many) of the mesh nature of things that happen on the Internet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, I created <a href="/r/TheFappening">/r/TheFappening</a> and I can explain this fairly easily. I saw the sub blowing up about an hour after I created it and I was getting modmail after modmail asking to mod the sub. I clicked the profile of every one who asked to see how many communities they moderated to decide if I wanted to bring them aboard. I only selected people who moderated a lot of communities or default subs because I needed people who had experience modding large and active communities. So, it wasn&#39;t that they were given mod status by default, I chose them because they are good at what they do.</p>
