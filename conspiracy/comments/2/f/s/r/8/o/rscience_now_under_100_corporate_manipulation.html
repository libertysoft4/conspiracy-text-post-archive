        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yesterday there was a thread top on the front page of Reddit with an unrealistic amount of upvotes for something which is an incredibly boring topic for the Reddit Hive-Mind, it&#39;s obviously been falsely pushed to the top by our corporate friends, they&#39;ve found a new use for their marketing budgets.  </p>

<p><strong>61 percent fall in female genital warts due to free HPV vaccine</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/2fqlxi/61_percent_fall_in_female_genital_warts_due_to/">http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/2fqlxi/61_percent_fall_in_female_genital_warts_due_to/</a></p>

<p>Some real posters could smell something wasn&#39;t right <a href="http://i.imgur.com/i7D9DKq.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/i7D9DKq.jpg</a> they&#39;ve clocked that this repetitive pro-vaccine whitewash is a bit odd.  There were also lots of shills posting the Party Line and &#39;I LOVE SCIENCE!&#39; to drown out the real posters who were posting stories about the horrifying complications which they&#39;ve witnessed post-vaccine.</p>

<p>Personally, after having read hundreds of studies and case studies on this vaccine over a number of years, I came in to sum up with my own conclusion, but apparently my comments were &#39;inappropriate&#39;, apparently only one side of the story i.e. pro-vaccine, is appropriate.</p>

<p>Going forward the most important thing is that as many people in <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a> as possible realize what&#39;s going on and that these posts are just paid-for Big Pharma commercials, not real information with real posters.</p>

<p>For the record, here&#39;s my comment on the HPV vaccine which they decided was &#39;inappropriate&#39;.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Right, so apparently these ruthless corporations are willing to destroy their own Cancer Industry for the good of humanity....hmmm...anyone actually believe that? Look into the lifelong autoimmune diseases being induced by this vaccine, they are highly profitable diseases leaving people dependent on expensive drugs for the rest of their lives. Sorry folks, that&#39;s the only way this makes sense, that&#39;s the only way this jigsaw fits together properly.</p>

<p>Look into why Japan has stopped their HPV program, read up on why Spain, France and India are all considering a ban on the vaccine.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe the Reddit Hivemind Hype, look into these topics yourself and keep away from corporate controlled sites like the CDC and FDA, that why you&#39;ll stay clear of propaganda.</p>

<p>Listen to the girls and families telling their stories</p>

<p>He agreed with my decision!  He said for most it isn&#39;t worth the money and time except for in the most extreme cases; but he still offered me the procedure regardless.</p>

<p>I do know that Polio was pretty bad before the vaccine was created and today, we rarely see people with Polio.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>pbae,</p>

<p>I used to believe that most vaccines were good, however after spending a long time on this, going into great detail on every vaccines, I&#39;ve found clear evidence that vaccines are simply shots in the dark, the evidence to back them up does not exist, and Big Pharma have no interest in cleaning them up as by causing an epidemic of autoimmune disease it sends their sales sky-rocketing.</p>

<p>Polio used to be harmless in the majority, with mild flu like symptoms in less than 5%.  Then some women stopped breast-feeding and modern medicine decided to remove part of the immune system which protects against Polio i.e. tonsils, this is when a very small % of people started to have problems with Polio.  The vaccine was produced, it didn&#39;t reduce the rate of Polio, so they started renaming Polio into a number of other diseases to cover up it&#39;s existence.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been admitted by the former head of Merck that some Polio vaccines have been contaminated with HIV and the Cancer-causing SV40 virus, so these have been doing a lot more harm than good.  Then we have the Live Polio vaccines which Bill Gates has been sending over to India, where researchers have been appalled by the fact that the vaccines are causing a disease twice as deadly as Polio and with exactly the same symptoms, but Big Pharma give that one a different name to make it look like their vaccine is a &#39;success&#39;.</p>

Be it  medicine (HPV vaccines, anyone?) or technology (IBM just made a 7nm transistor, Intel is on shaky ground...) or anything else that hits gold in r/science. Wild speculation can allow a foothold for other non-science and nefarious intents. At best misinformation is spread, at worst we provide a blog with tons of traffic and ad revenue prompting them to continue with crazy posts, and at the very worst people read a snippet about medications or healthcare and take it to heart without ever seeing the dissenting opinions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23902317">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23902317</a></p>

<p>&quot;We documented here the evidence of the potential of the HPV vaccine to trigger a life-disabling autoimmune condition. The increasing number of similar reports of post HPV vaccine-linked autoimmunity and the uncertainty of long-term clinical benefits of HPV vaccination are a matter of public health that warrants further rigorous inquiry.&quot;</p>

<p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines as an option for preventing cervical malignancies: (how) effective and safe?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23016780">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23016780</a></p>

<p>&quot;We carried out a systematic review of HPV vaccine pre- and post-licensure trials to assess the evidence of their effectiveness and safety. We find that HPV vaccine clinical trials design, and data interpretation of both efficacy and safety outcomes, were largely inadequate. Additionally, we note evidence of selective reporting of results from clinical trials (i.e., exclusion of vaccine efficacy figures related to study subgroups in which efficacy might be lower or even negative from peer-reviewed publications). Given this, the widespread optimism regarding HPV vaccines long-term benefits appears to rest on a number of unproven assumptions (or such which are at odd with factual evidence) and significant misinterpretation of available data. For example, the claim that HPV vaccination will result in approximately 70% reduction of cervical cancers is made despite the fact that the clinical trials data have not demonstrated to date that the vaccines have actually prevented a single case of cervical cancer (let alone cervical cancer death), nor that the current overly optimistic surrogate marker-based extrapolations are justified. Likewise, the notion that HPV vaccines have an impressive safety profile is only supported by highly flawed design of safety trials and is contrary to accumulating evidence from vaccine safety surveillance databases and case reports which continue to link HPV vaccination to serious adverse outcomes (including death and permanent disabilities). We thus conclude that further reduction of cervical cancers might be best achieved by optimizing cervical screening (which carries no such risks) and targeting other factors of the disease rather than by the reliance on vaccines with questionable efficacy and safety profiles.&quot;</p>

<p>The first study seems to be of only 3 women, but is still pretty interesting. The second really pounces on the effectiveness and safety testing the vaccine was put through, criticizing procedures and accusing it of selective sampling. That&#39;s a pretty big deal.</p>

<p>&quot;My name is William Thompson.  I am a Senior Scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where I have worked since 1998.</p>

<p>I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information  in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased  risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>false.  &quot;polio&quot; was reclassified into numerous other diseases around the same time it was supposedly &quot;eradicated&quot; due to the polio vaccine. In reality, polio cases just became reclassified as we learned more and more about subtle variations in diseases. 
What happened was that increased awareness of sanitation combined with a &quot;reclassification&quot; of what was known as polio led to the &quot;eradication&quot; of the disease. Right around the same time that the vaccine was introduced in the 50&#39;s, polio was finally reclassified as numerous diseases since we were starting to understand more about the subtle variations between them.</p>

<p>&quot;Polio&quot; until that point had referred to a whole group of ailments...and shortly after the vaccine was introduced, cases that previously had been labeled as &quot;polio&quot; now were identified correctly. This led to a sharp drop in reported polio cases, when what was happening was that there were just as many &quot;polio-like&quot; cases that they just weren&#39;t calling polio anymore.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22591873">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22591873</a></p>

<p>Researchers reported:</p>

<p>&quot;while India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. Though this data was collected within the polio surveillance system, it was not investigated. The principle of primum-non-nocere [First, do no harm] was violated.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is because they use a live oral vaccine (OPV) in India.  OPV has been banned in most first world Nations because it was found to have some pretty severe side effects, NPAFP being one of the major ones.  </p>

<p>Pharmaceutical corporations are notorious for pawning off their dangerous, dated &quot;cures&quot; on third world nations, including Bayer knowingly selling HIV infected hemophilia medicine, and older MMR vaccines (banned in Europe for causing very dangerous fevers often resulting in brain damage and.. surprise.. ASD diagnoses) sold cheap to poorer nations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccine damage? How could they cause damage? You do that vaccines are just deactivated viral proteins. Your immune system simply sees these and makes antibodies for it. If what you say is true the same thing happens every time you are exposed to any virus. WHICH HAPPENS DAILY. What you are saying is completely illogical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look into what an adjuvant does, in order for a vaccine to have a chance of working it also has to be dangerous i.e. to increase the chance of a desired immune response one must also increase the risk of an undesirable immune response which leaves the you with an autoimmune disease (the body fighting itself) e.g. Diabetes Type 1, MS etc.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the fact that injecting metals is bad news for the brain, as this professor explains</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the hell? This is even more evidence that you have zero idea what you are talking about. It in no way has to be dangerous. The body will mount an immune response to foreign proteins it encounters and then it remembers those proteins so in the future it knows how to fight them. This is basic biology. There is nothing special about the immune response against vaccines that would cause an autoimmune response of any sort. The flu or even a common cold can cause a much more heavy response than a vaccine does. It&#39;s ridiculous to claim any real danger of developing an autoimmune disease from a vaccine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Different people have different immune systems.</p>

<p>There is a percentage of people who get a flu vaccine and <strong>get</strong> the flu while others don&#39;t.
Getting the flu is one thing but getting Autism is a life long struggle.  I don&#39;t know if vaccines cause Autism or not but I&#39;m keeping an open mind about the cases and evidence that I see where it is linked.</p>

<p>But i do feel that the vaccine schedule is pretty harsh.  They give children in this country 49 doses of 14 vaccines before age 6.</p>

<p>At the ripe old age of 2 months, a baby is given vaccines for:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Diphtheria,
Tetanus,
Pertussis,
Polio,
HIB,
Rotavirus
Hepatitis B,
PCV,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this doesn&#39;t alarm an adult or parent, then please go get these vaccines injected into yourself in one sitting because it&#39;s safe, correct?</p>

<p>But as an adult, why stop there?  The same adults should go back and get vaccinated at 4 months with these vaccines:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Diphtheria,
Tetanus,
Pertussis,
Polio,
HIB,
Rota,virus
PCV,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And again, why stop there?</p>

<p>Go back at 6 months and get these vaccines in one sitting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Diphtheria,
Tetanus,
Pertussis,
Polio,
Rotavirus,
Hepatitis B
PCV,
Influenza,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And no need to worry because <strong>all</strong> vaccines are safe, correct?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course people get vaccines and still get the disease. People&#39;s immune systems aren&#39;t perfect and no one is expecting them to be.

Also, I found it odd that you replied to a post that was a month old and in addition to that, your user history shows that you have a 7 year old account in which you sporadically use.</p>

<p><strong>BUT,</strong> if you click on that CNN link in my first post, you&#39;ll find this statement:</p>

<p>UPDATE, September 6: It has been found that “Translational Neurodegeneration” broken their own rules when they pulled Dr. Hookers research paper.</p>

<p>That link you provided is the one that has been found to have broken it&#39;s own rules when they pulled Dr. Hookers papers.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll go on to say that I&#39;ve seen videos of actual families (plural, which means more than one family) that say that their once healthy child got some kind of brain damage as a result of being vaccinated.</p>

<p>GlaxoSmithKline has just been fined in China for bribery of officials and I found this statement in an article:</p>

<p>UK-based GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), is said to have purposely suppressed clinical studies and intimidated researchers who discovered that its pioneering diabetes drug, Avandia, significantly increased the risk of heart attacks.  <a href="http://rt.com/news/drugs-fines-corporations-crime-671/">Link</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t find it beyond Pharma to have intimidated or bought someone off to get Dr. Hooker&#39;s article pulled, especially since it&#39;s been found that they went and broke their own rules in getting an article pulled.</p>

<p>When hundreds of millions of dollars are involved, the people&#39;s interest aren&#39;t what big corporations have in mind.  Profit is and it&#39;s been shown what lengths these Pharmas will do to get their product to market.</p>

<p>&quot;My name is William Thompson.  I am a Senior Scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where I have worked since 1998.</p>

<p>I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information  in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased  risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed.&quot;</p>

<p>That all fits in, as at one stage the head of the CDC did admit in an interview that vaccines cause Autism</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3336455/Secret-report-reveals-18-child-deaths-following-vaccinations.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3336455/Secret-report-reveals-18-child-deaths-following-vaccinations.html</a></p>

<p>&quot;Eighteen babies and toddlers have died following childhood vaccinations in just four years, a secret Government report reveals.</p>

<p>Four deaths have been linked to suspected adverse reactions to the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) triple jab, according to documents prepared for the Government&#39;s expert advisers on immunisation.</p>

<p>The controversial jab has been beset by fears of a link to autism and bowel disease, although since its introduction in 1998, yearly deaths from measles have fallen from 16 to zero, while the jab against meningitis C is thought to save 50 lives a year.</p>

<p>The report, covering the period between 2001 and 2004, details how one baby suffered a cot death following MMR vaccination in 2003. Two more infants were reported to have died after having the MMR jab in 2001, but the cause of death in both cases was unknown.&quot;</p>

<p>When Japan stopped vaccinating the under-2&#39;s Crib Death completely disappeared in the country and Japan jumped right up to number 1 in the ranking for infant mortality rates i.e. they had the best infant mortality rate in the world.</p>

<p>The USA gives the most vaccines per child (by a long way), they also have the worst infant mortality rate in the developing world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if there was a link between autism and vaccines and all the anti-vaccinators were right... It is still more then worth it. </p>

<p>The ever so small chance of developing something from it is worth the 99% protection from many of the diseases prevented. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about anyone else... But seeing the effect of polio(which has effectively been wiped off the planet) ... I would choose the risk autism over that any day.</p>

<p>How many lives were saved and spared the ravages of polio because of the vaccine?  It has been wiped out from many parts of the world thanks to Vaccine.  Small pox, same thing.  Ask people from 60-70 years ago if any are still alive and ask them if they would still vaccinate their children to protect them from Polio if it ment there was a very slight chance(and that is giving a lot based on the statistics) they could develope some other life long condition.  Death by Polio or a lifetime of dealing with Multiple Sclerosis?  </p>

<p>If you are claiming that the evironmental factor is Vaccine...you are jumping to conclusions where are not there and ignoring everything else that can lead to diabetes that is different bewteen the 2 countries.  Like how the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_average_wage">Average Finnish have over triple the monthly income of the average Russian</a>  therefore can spend more on things that lead to diabetes.  </p>

<p>If anything these maps show that Vaccines work.</p>

<p>FUCK NO!  That is now how correlation works at all.  We can easily blame the higher income for the higher instances of diabetes in Finland vs Russia...number back that up too...especially when you pull in other countries with higher incomes and Diabetes rates.  There is a correllation there too.  Looking at that Hib Map...is Russia and the poorest of countries do not have high levels of Vaccination.</p>

<p>The correlation between genetics and lifestyle have a much high signifigance then any vaccine.</p>

<p>What information?  A correlation with no proof as to what is causing it.  There are so many factors you ignore since they do not fit in with your theory.  Where is the proof that his vaccine causes Diabetes?  I can just as accurately say it is the higher income that causes diabetes if I were to use your methodology.</p>

<p>The studies show a small correlation.  I can point to studies that link Diabetes to higher incomes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unless there&#39;s evidence that it&#39;s the vaccine, as has been provided, the rate of Diabetes Type 1 rises after the introduction of Hib.</p>

<p>But they do not say it causes it.  If you are looking for a link you will find it.  AKA: Confirmation Bias.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So they have shown that beyond any doubt that this vaccine causes Diabetes...Well then where is the Nobel Prize? </p>

<p>You will not get through to him.</p>

<p>Even if he is right...let&#39;s say there is a correlation between Vaccines and some of the disease he is claiming are caused by it..IT IS WORTH THE RISK!</p>

<p>Near 100% protection from polio, small pox, and other diseased where we can be vaccinated against is well worth the small risk of developing Autism or MS or Diabetes.  Risking a high chance of death vs a small chance of a lifelong condition...I will take MS please.  Though him claiming Vaccines cause MS is just insane being that we do have not even discovered what causes MS yet.  And I for one would give almost anything to find out.  </p>

<p>And claims Vaccines cause Diabetes...Sorry but the statistics just can not support such a claim.  We would expect it to be much more common in children...but it does not even break 1% of the population until the 20-25 age category.  and 20% for seniors...claiming a vaccine causes Diabetes when you are senior...completely ignoring everything else is just bad research.  If it were caused by a Vaccine in some small way we would see a more equal distribution accross various countries if it were caused by vaccines...but we do not see that at all.</p>

Had they been true to their &quot;oath&quot; they would have also done rest of the work properly, when no more accountability or money was involved, avoiding the cancer from radiation and amputation from poorly done biopsy. And more private operations we paid out of the settlement money. Its only money, the world is a BUSINESS.</p>

<p>Oh boo hoo...5 years experiencing the medical system in your small world.</p>

<p>So you had a bad experience and think the rest of the system is exactly the same.  You have your own little conspiracy theory that makes the system fit in with your personal belief.</p>

<p>The American system is flawed, no arguement there.  But to blame the entire system and all the doctors for your one personal experience...is utter nonsense.  </p>

<p>That is what you believe.  You can go out and find most doctors all over the world and yes even in the US take that oath very seriously.  </p>

And trust me this was because we work with potentially infected blood so anyone who is even borderline gets a booster... So we don&#39;t mess around with immunity status. All of us were still immune, consistent with published literature. There is some thought the pertussis wanes eventually and needs a booster, but it does cover the kids past the point were they will die from it and boosters are readily available.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a matter of who to believe, it&#39;s just the statistics behind it... if there was a shot that you could get which was proven to prevent heart disease completely, but had a 5% instant lethality, I&#39;d line up for that and sign the waiver: Chances aren&#39;t very good that it would kill me (1 in 20) but there&#39;s a much better chance that it could stop what would kill me down the road.</p>

<p>In the US, the ACS estimates that 12360 people will be diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer and 4020 people will die from it this year. ( <a href="http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cervicalcancer/detailedguide/cervical-cancer-key-statistics">http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cervicalcancer/detailedguide/cervical-cancer-key-statistics</a> )</p>

<p>Considering the Japanese statistics, for instance, 8.29 million people go the HPV vaccine, 106 people got serious adverse effects. Isn&#39;t that a .00128% adverse effect rate?</p>

<p>I&#39;m okay with that rate, but then I&#39;ve already had the vaccine. I agree that people should be educated first about anything that gets stuck in their bodies, though. Then again, I also think that people should have complete control over what gets put into their body and what stays (pro-choice and affirmative consent), and that&#39;s not a terribly popular bunch of opinions at times.</p>

<p>Looking around at the very few people who have those conditions is in NO WAY proof vaccines caused anything.  </p>

<p>All those show much stronger correlations to genetics.  The Link to Autism is non-existant.  Where is the proof?  To say all those are caused by Vaccines is utter nonsense.  Thankfully you removed MS from that...since in your previous posts you mentioned it...and saying it is caused by vaccines when we don&#39;t even know the cause...is just ignorance.  </p>

<p>If you can prove these are all linked...then please publish your work and claim your Nobel Prize.</p>

<p>Everything you listed can have and does have other causes which are much more strongly correlated then any Vaccine.  Even if they did have a chance of causing those...whatever your small correlation is...weigh it against the much higher risk of death by those which are being vaccinated against...it&#39;s worth the risk!</p>

<p>You have no proof.  It has been studied again and again by people all around the world...the proof just isn&#39;t there.</p>

<p>So, what you are saying, is that <strong>every</strong> child who received a polio vaccine in Canada in the <strong>1950s</strong> was perfectly healthy? That&#39;s ridiculous, and yet, Polio is essentially nonexistent in North America. </p>

<p>Then why is the decline of measles directly correlated to the the number of people vaccinated and not to the relative health of the people?</p>

<p>That can be said about all diseases.  We see a decrease is all disease when santitaion and nutrition are improved.  Measles are almost unheard of in the general population today, the only people who get it are those that are unvaccinated.  A recent Measels out break in Canada was caused by an Unvaccinated child returning from the Netherlands in their &quot;Bible Belt&quot; where many protestants are anti-vaccine.  The child brought it back and infected other non-immunized children.  The disease spread quickly amoung pockets of population where there were large amount of unimmunized people.  Vaccines are the leading cause of why something like Measles is so rare now in Canada/US.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23902317">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23902317</a></p>

<p>&quot;We documented here the evidence of the potential of the HPV vaccine to trigger a life-disabling autoimmune condition. The increasing number of similar reports of post HPV vaccine-linked autoimmunity and the uncertainty of long-term clinical benefits of HPV vaccination are a matter of public health that warrants further rigorous inquiry.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines as an option for preventing cervical malignancies: (how) effective and safe?</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23016780">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23016780</a></p>

<p>&quot;We carried out a systematic review of HPV vaccine pre- and post-licensure trials to assess the evidence of their effectiveness and safety. We find that HPV vaccine clinical trials design, and data interpretation of both efficacy and safety outcomes, were largely inadequate. Additionally, we note evidence of selective reporting of results from clinical trials (i.e., exclusion of vaccine efficacy figures related to study subgroups in which efficacy might be lower or even negative from peer-reviewed publications). Given this, the widespread optimism regarding HPV vaccines long-term benefits appears to rest on a number of unproven assumptions (or such which are at odd with factual evidence) and significant misinterpretation of available data. For example, the claim that HPV vaccination will result in approximately 70% reduction of cervical cancers is made despite the fact that the clinical trials data have not demonstrated to date that the vaccines have actually prevented a single case of cervical cancer (let alone cervical cancer death), nor that the current overly optimistic surrogate marker-based extrapolations are justified. Likewise, the notion that HPV vaccines have an impressive safety profile is only supported by highly flawed design of safety trials and is contrary to accumulating evidence from vaccine safety surveillance databases and case reports which continue to link HPV vaccination to serious adverse outcomes (including death and permanent disabilities). We thus conclude that further reduction of cervical cancers might be best achieved by optimizing cervical screening (which carries no such risks) and targeting other factors of the disease rather than by the reliance on vaccines with questionable efficacy and safety profiles.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>remember the &quot;crazy woman&quot; jenny mcarthy saying vaccines causes autism and shit tone of other crap?. I think whats actually going on, at least with kids vaccines, is that vaccines as themselves are not the problem but what they put in additionally in vaccines. Vaccines are getting riddled with thimerosal (mercury), which is highly toxic, specially for a developing brain. They are using this as a vaccine preservative but it appears that the science is not right and they still dont have proper proof that thimerosal is safe. Maybe mcarthy  is not quite crazy after all. ( more info on the subject. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJXjIxP9aP8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJXjIxP9aP8</a>) Looking at how pharma companies operate i am not very surprised the hpv vaccine is getting a lot of heat now that a lot of people are getting bad secondary reactions or getting killed. Now when it comes to censoring on reddit, it looks quite worrying how easily they ban and delete posts that simply challenge the narrative or go against the grain but what can we do?  very worrying indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually a simple Google search will show that the Mercury in vaccines, ethylmercury, cannot pass the BBB. The mercury you get from fish, methylmercury, can pass through the BBB and actually is a neurotoxin. Also, one gets that methylmercury in a much higher dosage from a can of tuna than one gets ethylmercury from a vaccine. And that&#39;s the thing about toxins. They&#39;re dose - dependant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That may be the case with aluminum. I was however, refuting the original mercury claim. Methylmercury and ethylmercury are two very different things. The ethylmercury found in vaccines does not cross the brain blood barrier. But thanks for the video, interesting watch</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;almost completely phased out&quot;?  a lot of the flu shots today have thimerosal still in them and internationaly it is still being used.</p>

<p>i did do a &quot;wiki&quot; search before posting. toxicology part on the wiki:</p>

<p>|Cases have been reported of severe poisoning by accidental exposure or attempted suicide, with some fatalities.[16] Animal experiments suggest that thiomersal rapidly dissociates to release ethylmercury after injection; that the disposition patterns of mercury are similar to those after exposure to equivalent doses of ethylmercury chloride; and that the central nervous system and the kidneys are targets, with lack of motor coordination being a common sign. Similar signs and symptoms have been observed in accidental human poisonings. The mechanisms of toxic action are unknown. Fecal excretion accounts for most of the elimination from the body. Ethylmercury clears from blood with a half-life of about 18 days in adults. Ethylmercury is eliminated from the brain in about 14 days in infant monkeys. Risk assessment for effects on the nervous system have been made by extrapolating from dose-response relationships for methylmercury.[17] Methylmercury and ethylmercury distribute to all body tissues, crossing the blood–brain barrier and the placental barrier, and ethylmercury also moves freely throughout the body.[18]|

    <div class="md"><p>first off. fish may carry mercury but its Methylmercury. these vaccines carry ethylmercury which is bit different. second off, ingesting some of these types of mercury work differently than injecting them. third off, these so called &quot;preservatives&quot; are now useless since we just dont need them anymore. fourth off, there are hardly any studies out there other than the ones funded by pharma companies, that show these &quot;preservatives&quot; as safe. We dont need them, they are unnecessary in this day and age and thankfully they have been removed from some vaccines since 1999 but they are still out there, specially internationally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look into what an adjuvant does, in order for a vaccine to have a chance of working it also has to be dangerous i.e. to increase the chance of a desired immune response one must also increase the risk of an undesirable immune response which leaves the you with an autoimmune disease (the body fighting itself) e.g. Diabetes Type 1, MS etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Different people have different immune systems.</p>

<p>There is a percentage of people who get a flu vaccine and <strong>get</strong> the flu while others don&#39;t.
Getting the flu is one thing but getting Autism is a life long struggle.  I don&#39;t know if vaccines cause Autism or not but I&#39;m keeping an open mind about the cases and evidence that I see where it is linked.</p>

<p>But i do feel that the vaccine schedule is pretty harsh.  They give children in this country 49 doses of 14 vaccines before age 6.</p>

<p>At the ripe old age of 2 months, a baby is given vaccines for:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Diphtheria,
Tetanus,
Pertussis,
Polio,
HIB,
Rotavirus
Hepatitis B,
PCV,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this doesn&#39;t alarm an adult or parent, then please go get these vaccines injected into yourself in one sitting because it&#39;s safe, correct?</p>

<p>But as an adult, why stop there?  The same adults should go back and get vaccinated at 4 months with these vaccines:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Diphtheria,
Tetanus,
Pertussis,
Polio,
HIB,
Rota,virus
PCV,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And again, why stop there?</p>

<p>Go back at 6 months and get these vaccines in one sitting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Diphtheria,
Tetanus,
Pertussis,
Polio,
Rotavirus,
Hepatitis B
PCV,
Influenza,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And no need to worry because <strong>all</strong> vaccines are safe, correct?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is because they use a live oral vaccine (OPV) in India.  OPV has been banned in most first world Nations because it was found to have some pretty severe side effects, NPAFP being one of the major ones.  </p>

<p>Pharmaceutical corporations are notorious for pawning off their dangerous, dated &quot;cures&quot; on third world nations, including Bayer knowingly selling HIV infected hemophilia medicine, and older MMR vaccines (banned in Europe for causing very dangerous fevers often resulting in brain damage and.. surprise.. ASD diagnoses) sold cheap to poorer nations.</p>

<p>Look around you at the number of people with Diabetes Type 1, Epilepsy, Asthma, Motor Neurone Disease, Eczema, Peanut Allergies, Muscle Wasting Diseases and Autism, you&#39;ll then get an idea how many people are being left vaccine damaged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looking around at the very few people who have those conditions is in NO WAY proof vaccines caused anything.  </p>

<p>All those show much stronger correlations to genetics.  The Link to Autism is non-existant.  Where is the proof?  To say all those are caused by Vaccines is utter nonsense.  Thankfully you removed MS from that...since in your previous posts you mentioned it...and saying it is caused by vaccines when we don&#39;t even know the cause...is just ignorance.  </p>

<p>If you can prove these are all linked...then please publish your work and claim your Nobel Prize.</p>

<p>Everything you listed can have and does have other causes which are much more strongly correlated then any Vaccine.  Even if they did have a chance of causing those...whatever your small correlation is...weigh it against the much higher risk of death by those which are being vaccinated against...it&#39;s worth the risk!</p>

<p>You have no proof.  It has been studied again and again by people all around the world...the proof just isn&#39;t there.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>They conclude it&#39;s an environmental issue rather than genetic.</p>

<p>There are a lot of Enviromental factors...you can not single out Vaccines as the source.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I then show you that the Hib vaccine&#39;s been linked to Diabetes Type 1 already, and show you the map which highlights that Russia isn&#39;t vaccinating much with Hib, Finland vaccinates at 5.5 times the rate with Hib and has 5.5 times the rate of Diabetes Type 1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One picture...it displays a snap shot of information.  While yes diabetes is higher in the country with high vaccination rates...it does not mean they are linked.  Correlation is not causation.  I can show a link bewteen caucasians and sunburns when they travel to a tropical location...that does not mean being caucasian causes sun burns.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;ve got all the information we need there, this would have to be a one huge coincidence for the Hib vaccine not to be causing Diabetes Type e.g. a 1 in 10,000 coincidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What information?  A correlation with no proof as to what is causing it.  There are so many factors you ignore since they do not fit in with your theory.  Where is the proof that his vaccine causes Diabetes?  I can just as accurately say it is the higher income that causes diabetes if I were to use your methodology.</p>
