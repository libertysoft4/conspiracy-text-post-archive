<p>Is there any validity to this? Also which type of &quot;attack&quot; would they falsify?

    <div class="md"><p>guys, lets face facts, everyone is up in arms at the moment about a lot of very pressing, very important global issues and everyone thinks &#39;something is coming&#39; because of what they read and because of the discussions they are actively having with people who are from the same school of thought (<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>) - if something is going to happen, it will happen and we will be ready to call bullshit, that is what&#39;s most important. Have your camera phones ready, be critical of any information, record all the initial MSM reports if anything does happen and gather as much evidence as fucking possible if something does happen so it can be carefully scrutinised. </p>

<p>A lot of people fail to realise what i am about to say, but because we as a community are so consumed with the &#39;evil the government does&#39; we fail to also see how much, especially now, it is actually being combatted by the larger population. From scientists to pilots, from architects and whistleblowers. Don&#39;t forget, there has been a huge effort to launch stuff over the last year that just hasn&#39;t worked on the general public, everything from Syria to the (obviously faked) execution videos. People aren&#39;t just swallowing the narrative that they are told anymore and dont forget it, people are waking up and it is a massive force to reckon with</p>

<p>edit: a word</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it is possible that they could make financial dealings with mexican gangs such as The Knights Templar (not to be confused with the medieval faction), who have been known to successfully knock out the power grid in mexico. Especislly when considering how &quot;well financed and organized&quot; ISIS alledgedly is.</p>

<p>Im not saying its gonna happen, im jist sayin its possible. Whether or not ISIS is a &quot;real&quot; terrorist entity or a CIA/Mossad subsidiary entity doesnt affect this possibility. At least, this is my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mexican cartels are in a parasitical relationship with the united states. You don&#39;t help another parasite kill your host, or at the very least insure your eradication. Mexicans hate muslims more than the average non-catholic-atheist american. Besides, the Saudis, who run ISIS/ISIL, could easily charter jets and fly untold number of &quot;militants&quot; into the united states without anyone even checking. Saudi&#39;s are immune to security checks. Every member of the house of saud have diplomatic immunity and that extends to their planes, cars, itinerary, traveling companions, pilots, drivers, the young women they abduct of the streets for sex slaves...etc. Why would any of their soldiers have to cross through shit hole mexico? There are literally thousands of private airports that could ferry militants into the US, just like they were all ferried out after 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your position. And it makes sense, too.</p>

<p>I wasnt trying to imply thst the possibility is great. I was just pointing out, however slight, it still remains a possibility. Thats all.</p>

<p>But, on another note, if one is to believe that 9/11 was an &quot;inside&quot; job, meaning that some people in our own government actually had participated in its logistics or execution, it wouldnt be fsrfetched to acknowledge this former scenario to be the &quot;scapegoat&quot; of an excuse. </p>

<p>I can very well see the possibility that any attack could be &quot;explained&quot;, &quot;blamed,&quot; or in any way included in the &quot;official narrative&quot; after the fact. The point here is that it doesnt even have to happen in such a way. It just has to be plausible enough (from the perspective of the general population who might buy into such a story) to be effectively used in a &quot;scapegoat&quot;-esque manner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, <strong><em>IF</em></strong> there were to be an attack, whether a false flag or organicslly terroristical in nature, it could be many things. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Biological in nature: the syringe attack on the air martial recently highlights this possibility, as well as the suggestions of &quot;ebola martyrs&quot;, but this cstegory of attacks doesnt have to be limited to ebola. There are plenty of nasty organisms out there to choose from.</p></li>
<li><p>Those airplanes &quot;lost&quot; and &quot;stolen&quot; could possibly play a part.</p></li>
<li><p>(<em>This is the more plausible one, imo</em>) Attack on the power grid. I read an article not too long ago that explained how ISIS could easily make a monetary transactionbwith the Mexican gang called &quot;The Knights Templar&quot; (not to be confused with the midievil faction), who have been known to successfully attack Mexicos power grid, in exchange for their participation in such a large scale coordinsted attack. Furthermore, the article pointed out that only 19 of the 55 (if my memory serves me well) nodes are needed in order to wipe out our grid system for months, if not years. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The third scenario, if indeed it is a false flag type thing, would be &quot;going for broke&quot; so to speak. &quot;All in&quot;, if you will. I do not believe that TPTB are ready for this type of ante just yet, so i feel, <strong><em>if anything</em></strong> it will be on a smaller scale in order to perpetuate justification for more and more oppressive legislation. But, this is just my opinion...</p>

<p>Well, that may be your opinion. And thats okay, ill respect that.</p>

<p>I dont subscribe to such a notion. I do not deny the possibility of each being a false flag, but i will not say that i believe that all of them, 100% of them, are all false flags. </p>

<p>Just a thought, anyhow. In all seriousness i would doubt that which i had just posited.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was living on the east coast of Canada last winter, during the ice storm. Our area had about 7 to 10 days without power. Gas (for cars and generators) was running low, the shelves in grocery stores were almost bare and restaurants were not getting replenishments. </p>

<p>I am telling you this because society in my community was beginning to fall apart. People were abrupt, moody, conflicts were escalating, driving was a nightmare. I would guess complete chaos was a week or two away. I cannot see how shutting off electricity would ensure anyone&#39;s safety.</p>

<p>I do feel that the symbolism of another 9/11, 13 years after the first would be a major coup. The number 13 is of special signifigance to these sociopaths in charge. One of the scariest things about terror attacks is the elements of not knowing when and where.</p>

<p>Ok, the US government could do this if they wanted. Fine. They would have to falsify all of them because that is the only way they would happen.</p>

<p>Why would the US government do this? What is the motive? After you turn off the power grid, then what do you do? Do you think that the people will stand for this for long?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just feel as though there is an agenda 21 pushing us close to fema camps and martial law. I also recognize the numerical significance of the number 13 to those who believe there is a darker evil society. Either way the urban militarization is happening there are UN personnel on US soil and our &quot;free press&quot; refuse to cover any of this.  The sheep that think their govt is there to save them better reconsider their stance in society before their ushered into FEMA camps.</p>

<p>An emp strike?  Maybe.  All of this hype about all of these scenerios that MSM is pushing might just be bait and switch.  </p>

<p>I say this because they should have learned from 9/11 that everyone will be watching.  Unless they cant watch.</p>
