The US dollar only has value because we force people to trade oil for it, and if someone tries selling oil for anything else we invade.  Now russia comes along with the BRIC nations and are going to offer oil for other currencies.. so now people have a choice and can buy oil at reasonable price, and not have to be in debt to the federal reserve to buy some oil.</p>

<p>This is where I think the US is screwed.. because if the BRIC&#39;s succeed, the US dollar loses all worth, so i think they want to go to war with russia like really badly right now.. which also means we&#39;re screwed because russia isn&#39;t a bunch of poor arabs like we are used to bullying and it will be detrimental on us and the rest of the world because it will spark the bloodiest of world wars. </p>

<p>anyone else have a different perspective? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve posted the following idea on worldnews, where it contradicts the programmed groupthink and therefore, gets a hostile reception. I also posted it to geopolitics and got upvotes. It goes like this.</p>

<p>To understand what Russia is doing, you have to see the world through Russian eyes. Putin obviously doesn&#39;t wake up in the morning and say &quot;Gee, I wonder what bad guy stuff can I do today?&quot; He sees himself as the hero who sticks up for Russia.</p>

<p>And what do Russians think/worry about when it comes to geopolitics? Invasion. Russia has suffered from overland invasions in it&#39;s history. From the Mongols to the French under Napoleon.... and by Germany under the Nazis.</p>

<p>Right now, the Russians are looking at a steady eastward expansion of NATO. A west European military alliance. Check out this <a href="http://www.investwithalex.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/nato-expansion.jpg">map</a>. It shows the difference in NATO over the last 20 years. And <a href="http://foreignpolicyblogs.com/wp-content/uploads/nato-expansion.jpg">here&#39;s</a> a map that shows the nations that want to join.</p>

<p>Imagine that you&#39;re a Russian looking at these maps. It&#39;s easy to see a slow but steady process of encirclement. This is no secret either. It&#39;s part of a well-known US policy of Russian containment. So what does this have to do with Russia and WWIII?</p>

<p>Ukraine. This is a country that has a very long border with Russia. It also shares much of the coastline of the Black sea. If Ukraine were to become a NATO member, the Russians would have a member of a western European military alliance right on their border. We see NATO as the good guys, they don&#39;t.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s a catch to Ukraine joining NATO. Among other things, a country cannot join if they are involved in an active territorial dispute. Enter the Crimean penninsula. </p>

<p>By annexing the Crimea, the Russians have managed to ensure control over one of Russia&#39;s strategically important naval assets. At the same time, they created a territorial issue that prevents NATO from accepting Ukraine as a member nation. </p>

<p>I suspect that a similar motivation is behind Putin&#39;s support for the pro-Russian rebels in Eastern Ukraine. Prevent Ukraine from joining NATO, or perhaps, create a buffer state between NATO and Russia itself.</p>

<p>When you look at things this way, events in Ukraine, from a Russian perspective..... are <em>defensive</em> in nature. But the MSM has relentlessly been portraying them as naked aggression. </p>

<p>On a short scale of time, just focusing on the last few months, it does look like aggression. But if you take a look at the big picture and factor in things that have been taking place over a period of decades, the picture starts to look a lot different.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll finish this with a quote from George Orwell that seems appropriate:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All the war-propaganda, all the screaming and lies and hatred, comes invariably from people who are not fighting.</p>
</blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>You kind of hit on this, but don&#39;t underestimate what access to the Crimean Sea, means to Russia. </p>

<p>Before Ukraine gained independence, Odessa and I believe Sevastopol were their largest, and most strategic Naval bases. They controlled the Crimean Strait. I think this is also a huge reason for the takeover of Crimea. </p>

<p>Also, another reason IMHO for the takeover, is the nationalist atmosphere it creates. I think I read a study once, that argued when nationalism was rampant, birth rates were much higher. Russia is losing population like crazy. Putin has been incentivizing people to have children. I think this also plays into it.</p>

<p>This is a bit misleading. The US might have a policy of Russian containment, but the expansion of NATO happened mostly by allowing countries to join, rather than influencing or coercing them to do so. Take the Baltic&#39;s for example. It&#39;s difficult to overstate just how devastating Soviet rule was in these countries. It left a deep national trauma that is still visible today. Just as an anecdote, a friend of mine who is living in Estonia recently had his neighbours call the cops because an old lady wouldn&#39;t let the internet company in the basement to draw new lines, accusing them of being spies. A large portion of the population in these countries are still very scared of Russia.</p>

<p>It bothers me that people only see these countries as pawns in some great game. The US didn&#39;t expand NATO, most ex-Soviet countries joined as soon as they could because they saw themselves as incapable of defending themselves against Russia. </p>

<p>This makes it sound like the US influenced the eastern European countries to join NATO. My point was that all the US needed to do to encircle Russia was allowing the bordering nations to join. The only way Russia wouldn&#39;t be encircled by NATO is if the US denied membership of these countries.</p>

NATO across their border is a direct consequence of the Soviet Union. It&#39;s why Estonia is a NATO member but Finland isn&#39;t. Russia doesn&#39;t oppose NATO expansion because they&#39;re afraid of a western attack on Russia, they oppose it because it significantly reduces their possibility to influence those countries.

    <div class="md"><p>That is the most condescending thing I&#39;ve read in quite some while. Not literally everything is about the US. These little countries are perfectly capable of having an opinion that might not have been put there by the almighty force of the US government. </p>

<p>These are peoples who have long histories and cultural identities just like anyone else. The Soviet Union devastated their way of life. Huge amounts of people were sent to prison camps or executed. They lived for decades in fear under a foreign government, with a different culture and language. But no, that&#39;s not apparently not a valid reason for fear of that country. It was all invented by the US to scare them. I honestly would wish to see you explain to someone from the Baltic&#39;s who lived under Soviet rule that the reason for their paranoia against Russia stems from being brainwashed by neo conservative American propaganda. This fucking white washing of history for the sake of fitting your narrative is so unbelievably rude it hurts my brain.  </p>

<p>&quot;Lets annexx some parts from neighboring countries because it makes me feel safe&quot; is an explanation, not a justification. Just because he has a good reason for doing so doesn&#39;t make it any less evil. He is lying about sending troops over borders and causing instability and death. He utilises a propaganda machines that regularly lies about what is happening as long as it makes people love Russia and hate those neo nazi ukranians.</p>

<p>Yeah, he has got a reason to do why he is doing what he is doing. That doesn&#39;t make it right, that just means he has a reason. Israel has a reason for oppressing palestinians. They think it is instrumental in keeping the Israeli state safe. That is a reason, not a justification.</p>

<p>Well, they don&#39;t quite own it yet. But they are willing to do business with governments that the USA and Europe won&#39;t touch. And they come over in person, with plenty of funding, to open and run all kinds of local ventures.</p>

<p>China is definitely interested in Africa and to gain access the staggering amount of natural resources that Africa possesses. Most people don&#39;t realize this, but Africa is not represented correctly on most maps. This is especially true for the Mercator style maps.</p>

<p>They have distortions that make some parts of the world look larger and some look smaller. Africa is a lot bigger than you&#39;d think. Here is a <a href="http://static02.mediaite.com/geekosystem/uploads/2010/10/true-size-of-africa.jpg">map</a> that shows how vast the continent is. Now think of all this. The resources, the coastlines, the sheer amount of territory....... controlled by a country with 1.5 billion people. It just amazes me that China has been going full speed ahead in Africa for the last 20 years virtually unopposed while the USA diddles around in the Middle East worrying about oil.</p>

<p><strong>Gas</strong>: Transit (now in stage of privatization to the EU) and Oligarchic control over &quot;distribution contracts&quot; (ex-Ukraine PM Yulia Timoshenko was knowned as Gas Queen, amongst other key Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs). Russia-Ukrainian gas deals are murky, opaque, and sustain the wealth of well-related oligarchs in both countries.</p>

<p><strong>Trade Partner</strong>: For Russia, Ukraine is an indispensable part of Putin&#39;s Euroasian Economic Union as is Russia&#39;s military-complex (including aviation, rocketry, weapons) reliant on Ukrainian manufacturing. As for the EU, Ukraine with its 40 million population (even if through indebtness) has the possiblity to become an important EU-market for its flailing economy, and besides all the property still under government control that can always be privatized to pay off such debt.</p>

<p><strong>Slavic Spring</strong>: Fear amongst Putin&#39;s intelligence circle that an Euromaidan could repeat itelf in Russia. While the 2011 Arab-Springs-inspired protests (mainly Bolotniy Ploschad) were succesfully dismantled and legislation has since been increasingly aggressive (censorship, regulating NGO and Non-profits, harsh sentences for protestors). Putin as such has demonstrated his &quot;flavor&quot; of politics (Conservative-Religious-Nationalism) as a &quot;superior-alternative&quot; to the West&#39;s (Decadent-Perverted-Liberalism), specially at 84% approval rating. And apparently his &quot;Flavor&quot; is gaining &quot;fans&quot; specially in Turkey, India, and even EU&#39;s right-wing parties.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In early May of 2006, the president of the United States, George W Bush, the commander in chief of the United States Military, stated that 2001 was the beginning of World War III. His remarks were confirmed by Dan Gillerman, at the time Israel&#39;s UN Ambassador, when he also acknowledged during a routine UN Security Council meeting on 30 May 2006 that World War III had already begun. Many consider these two statements from two of the main nuclear powers in the world to be the declaration of War, indicating that World War III has already started. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_III#cite_note-Introduction-9">Also</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“But even with the help of the Israelis - especially with the help of the Israelis! - we couldn&#39;t defeat the Iranians, the &#39;Arabs&#39;, the world of Islam or the whole Third World if it should turn against us. We [the CIA] have reason to believe that Soviet strategists well understand this, and that the Third World War that they envision will be one of ourselves against shapeless forces of the Third World, with Soviet Russia ostensibly aloof from it...The U.S Government was sinking into exactly the dilemma that best suited the purposes of Moscow&#39;s Leninists as they&#39;ve begun to blossom under Gorbachev. In materials easily available to the U.S government without recourse to espionage, they had made it clear enough that in their version of the Third World War the United States would be forced into a variety of situations in which it would feel compelled to play the role of a powerful nation but, for all the world to see on it television sets, it would in fact, be powerless.&quot; The Game Player: Confessions of the CIA&#39;s Original Political Operative, London: Aurum Press, 1989 </p>

<p>The real &quot;real&quot; end-goal of Russia is not even regime change in Kiev: it is regime change on the planet.  There is no doubt in my mind whatsoever that both Russia and China want to create a New World Order, but one very different one from the one envisioned by Bush, Fukushima, Obama and the rest of the AngloZionist 1%ers.  Russia and China want a complete deconstruction of the AngloZionist Empire, they want to de-dollarize the world economy, the want an multi-polar international world order in which the rule of law is respected because it is understood that it is the most advantageous way to deal with problems.  Russia see its future in her North and in Siberia, China wants its economy to go global, including the Far-East Asia and the Pacific region, Africa and Latin America.  Russia also wants to role of Latin America and Central Asia to become more important because without these continents and regions there can be no truly multi-polar world.  I would also argue that both Russia and China are rejecting the western civilizational model and it&#39;s key dogmas (I won&#39;t list them here lest I offend or infuriate new readers, but my longtime readers know exactly what I mean) and that they are both seeking to create not only a different world order but a different civilization.  All this is much, much bigger than the Donbass or even the entire Ukraine.  Yes, at this moment in time, the frontline of the global civilizational war is going straight across the Ukraine, but this is only one battle in a much bigger and wider war.</p>

<p>they dont actually want a nuclear war, the american politicians. they want putin to be assassinated. but if they fail, we know what will happen.</p>

seeing what gets the most public approval, what they can get away with and what people will and will not fall for.</p>

<p>time is obviously not an issue to them since look at how long of a play from WWI to now has all the crooked underhanded back door moves played out.</p>

<p>its really just waiting game for them to figure out what method will yield the best results for their ideal setup and then setting that plan into motion.</p>

<p>so until then they aim at gaining more and more control in other aspects of the world so that regardless of the outcome they will still be on top.</p>
