    <div class="md"><p>Ebola is airborne, just not in the way the flu is considered airborne. With Ebola it can survive in water droplets (&quot;aerosols&quot;), which can be ejected into the air via vomiting, sneezing, crapping, etc. Plus with an extremely humid climate (Africa!) it&#39;s effectively airborne like the flu. This is the only explanation for the infection rate: for every 1 person with Ebola, 2 have become infected. What&#39;s the infection rate for the flu? (Hint: it&#39;s the same.)</p>

<p>Our main hope is that in northern climates it really isn&#39;t as airborne, containment efforts are effective, and that it doesn&#39;t mutate in dangerous ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason people who are properly educated on the subject continue to claim ebov Zaire is not airborne s simply because data on the subject indicates that this is the case.

<p>The only argument you have offered  on this topic hinges on a semantic turn of phrase and indicates a profound misunderstanding and/or willful misinterpretation of clinical terminology and the main reason I will continue to push this point with you is because this fundamental misunderstanding is immeasurably detrimental to your own knowledge of the topic.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Airborne:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>moving or being carried through the air. (Per webster-merriam)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Through many different sources, we all know ebola can be spread through infectious bodily fluids, including but not limited to sputum and saliva, which are cast as aersolized particles when sneezes, vomits, etc. In this way, the infectious fluids certainly can travel through the air, and by definition, can be said to be airborne.</p>

<p>However, the medical establishment does not consider ebola to be transmitted via airborne means due to instability (at the molecukar level) while it is outside of its host, as well as the aerosolized particles size, being much larger to effectively carry the infections virions than the aerosolized particles strewn about with, say, the flu. </p>

<p>Because they are strict with their labels, they do not consider it to be airborne, because it doesnt fit their strict definitions and requirements to be consjdered as such. But, by pure definition, it certainly can be transmitted through the air, hence, airborne. Its all semantics and depends on the prerequisite one uses in order tobapply that label.</p>

<p>What the other user was positing, is that in near 100% humidity environments, the efficacy of larger aerosolized particles (as those with ebola) increases as humidity increases. Though, i will admit, i knkw nothing about this claim. It makes sense at face value, but im no virologist.</p>

<p>As far as eidonofnights comments, my previous encounters with him and stuff, i know hes been paying attention to the R-noughts of various viruses, and he is pointing out how ebolas current r-nought seems to be much higher than was is generally expected (this <strong><em>is</em></strong> what the data suggests). One of the best explanations for this is that this current outbreaks strain seems to be better transmitted via airborn means than in previous outbreaks, bringing in question the mutations common in the virus family.</p>

<p>Not unsprisingly, the virologists at WHO akd the CDC have publicly admitted that this strain alone has had something like 250 mutations since the zero patient. They are watching it mutate almost in real time. Admittingly, they acknowledge thst the mutstions thus far are slight amd dont seem to be all that advantageous in regards to transmissibity, but it is not at all that farfetched of an idea to assume that one day, very soon, ebola might mutate effectively to become much more infectious via airborne means. This is not my opinion, it is the opinion of WHO and the CDC.</p>

<p>But still, as you suggested in your comment, the argument is in semantics, not function. By definition, ebola certainly is airborne. But its not nearly as effective in infectivity via this route of transmission than viruses such as influenze that are better suited for airborne transmission, falling short of their requirements for a pathogen to be &quot;clinically&quot; determined to be airborne.</p>

<p>You yourself admitted that it&#39;s contagious in aerosol and as we&#39;ve been over aerosol is an airborne route.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False.</p>

<p><strong>aerosol is NOT the same as airborne</strong> Despite your repeated claims otherwise.</p>

<p>Yes, aerosol transmission is bad, however, <em>airborne transmission</em> is much, much worse.  For a disease to be transmissible by aerosol, the uninfected person must be in close contact with the infected person.  For a disease to be truly <em>airborne</em> has much more to deal with how far the virus can travel.  </p>

<p>If a disease to be transmitted by aerosol, they guy whose face you cough in will get the disease.  If it&#39;s airborne, so will the guy across the room, and possibly the one down the hall.  <em>That</em> is the difference.  This picture might help illustrate my point.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough.  </p>

<p>Perhaps over the years, I have grown too accustomed to the rhetoric of scientific discourse which is deliberately peckish, prudish and pedantic (but for good and valid reasons).  </p>

<p>In the desire to describe and understand observed phenomena as precisely as possible given state of all currently available evidence on that particular topic, minutiae which would seem insignificant in normal conversation must necessarily become topics of intense scrutiny and debate within the scientific community.</p>

<p>Perhaps, if anything, I&#39;m arguing that the general public needs to be more educated on what these terms mean in the scientific community in order to avoid such misinterpretations(and their almost inevitable distortions in mainstream/nonscientific media).  </p>

<p>And of of course, by saying this I do not mean to pejoratively imply that the general public is uneducated, unimpassioned, or ignorant with regard to scientific topics, far from it. </p>

<p>Rather, the responsibility to promote knowledge falls upon the educated and the scientific community and the public at large are both best served by concerted efforts to better communicate the facts, in order to more easily facilitate a common discourse on some of the most important questions we all face as human beings from microscopic to cosmic.</p>

<p>Given that the content of my discussion with <a href="/u/EidolonofNight">/u/EidolonofNight</a> over the past 2 days has not moved beyond the mere possibility of aerosolized transmission, we have not been able to advance into a discussion of the likelihood of transmission by this route, its rate of occurrence, or its impact on viral transmission in any setting beyond the laboratory (and most evidence seems to indicate that this is not a primary or even statistically significant route of infection) all of which are far more important and germane to any rational discussion of the current ebov Zaire outbreak.</p>

<p>The problem is that when terms such as &#39;airborne transmission&#39; are used publicly without providing a clear definition of what is intended by that term is that it allows for all manner of speculation and inaccuracy to be perpetuated.  </p>

<p>The horrific nature of symptoms sufferred by ebov Zaire victims coupled with recent pop culture depictions of hemmoragic fevers (Outbreak and the like) facilitate an environment in which it is both easy and understandable for the general public to develop disproportionate fears based on little to no factual information about the virus itself. And as we all know, there would be no shortage of opportunists available to potentially take advantage of the climate of fear raised around a particularly horrible disease such as this.  And therein lies the danger of using improperly defined terms. </p>

<p>For instance, if the hypothetical headline <strong>&quot;WHO continues to deny airborne transmission of ebola&quot;</strong> were to be printed....while truthful, to a certain degree, would actually be misleading, because the average reader not be likely to infer from this (unless it is explicitly stated in the accompanying text) that the scientific community uses a different definition of the term &quot;airborne&quot;.</p>

<p>Similarly, random, unevidenced postings on the internet that &quot;ebola is airborne!&quot; are disingenuous, do nothing to describe the state of the current events, often serve little purpose other than to sensationalize the current situation and foster a climate of misunderstanding in which the actual medical facts of the situation are often obscured, distorted, or just plain left by the wayside.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. This is a perfect explanation that i feel needs to be read, digested, analyzed, and understood by all. I couldnt have put it bettet than that.</p>

<p>Specifically, i like how you mention that the scientific community actually <strong><em>needs</em></strong> to be so specific and precise with their labels, for the reasons you gave accurately. This need is generally not present in casual discussions, including the ones speculative in nature on reddit and this sub in particular.</p>

<p>I was even astonished how you share my sentiment regarding responsibility of the scientific and medical communities to make it clear that when they say &quot;it isnt airborne&quot; they do not mean it is impossible to be transmitted through the air, in the fundamental sense of semantics. It is very important to understand the scientific communitys perspective and perogatives when they say this. For, if they werent so concise with their wordings, misunderstandings would become rampant amongst them, stifling much of their scientific breakthroughs and whatnot.</p>

<p>This is, imo, where a lot of conspiracy theories are born. With semantical misinterpretations and misunderstanding of the inentions behind official statements. It is so easy for one to conclude that since they say it isnt airborn, they are maliciously lying to us and trying to kill everyone. Thats ignorant of everything youve said in that awesome comment.</p>

<p>I hope i didnt come off as rude by interjecting in yalls transactions. I only wanted to point out exactly what you have said. I jist cant help myself when i see folks arguing basically the same thing but from different perspectives, wherein both sides were valid and accurate (but for different reasons), you know what i mean?</p>

<p>For your own admission, the difference is in the distance the infectious particle can travel. Yet, in both routes, they travel through the air. This is an argument on semantics and what is and isnt accepted labels by the medical establishment. In both cases, the infectious virions travel through the air, and by definition that airborne. </p>

<p>But, to be considered &quot;clinically labelled&quot; as airborn, it must meet certsin requirements. The only difference between &quot;aerosol transmission&quot; and &quot;airborne transmission&quot; in your argument, as well as in the perspectives of the experts, is not in the <strong><em>route</em></strong> of transmission, but in the <strong><em>efficacy</em></strong> of that route of transmission.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, we meet again.  </p>

<p>I see you&#39;re still harboring the same misconceptions about about what defines a disease as transmissible by the airborne route.  Continuing to assert things which are <em>demonstrably</em> incorrect does no one a service, and limits your own ability to understand the real facts of the situation.  Shall we continue where we left off?</p>

<p>For the benefit of others, reading this: airborne transmission of certain strains of ebolavirus absolutely <em>are</em> transmissible via the airborne route <strong>between animals and nonhuman primates</strong> (Ebov Reston which does <strong>not cause disease in humans</strong>) The position that you seem to be arguing is that is also transmissible in this fashion between animals/NHP to human and human to human.  </p>

<p>I think we need to understand and clarify the differences between airborne transmission and droplet transmission, which while similar in appearance are nonetheless clinically distinct. And also the difference in isolation precautions necessary to prevent  human to human and animal/NHP to human infection under those conditions.</p>

<p>From the CDC:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>III.B.2. Droplet Precautions</strong> Droplet Precautions are intended to prevent transmission of pathogens spread through close respiratory or mucous membrane contact with respiratory secretions as described in I.B.3.b. Because these pathogens do not remain infectious over long distances in a healthcare facility, special air handling and ventilation are not required to prevent droplet transmission. Infectious agents for which Droplet Precautions are indicated are found in Appendix A and include B. pertussis, influenza virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, N. meningitides, and group A streptococcus (for the first 24 hours of antimicrobial therapy). A single patient room is preferred for patients who require Droplet Precautions. When a single-patient room is not available, consultation with infection control personnel is recommended to assess the various risks associated with other patient placement options (e.g., cohorting, keeping the patient with an existing roommate). Spatial separation of &gt; 3 feet and drawing the curtain between patient beds is especially important for patients in multi-bed rooms with infections transmitted by the droplet route. Healthcare personnel wear a mask (a respirator is not necessary) for close contact with infectious patient; the mask is generally donned upon room entry. Patients on Droplet Precautions who must be transported outside of the room should wear a mask if tolerated and follow Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette.
III.B.3. Airborne Precautions Airborne Precautions prevent transmission of infectious agents that remain infectious over long distances when suspended in the air (e.g., rubeola virus [measles], varicella virus [chickenpox], M. tuberculosis, and possibly SARS-CoV) as described in I.B.3.c and Appendix A. The preferred placement for patients who require Airborne Precautions is in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR). An AIIR is a single-patient room that is equipped with special air handling and ventilation capacity that meet the American Institute of Architects/Facility Guidelines Institute (AIA/FGI) standards for AIIRs (i.e., monitored negative pressure relative to the surrounding area, 12 air exchanges per hour for new construction and renovation and 6 air exchanges per hour for existing facilities, air exhausted directly to the outside or recirculated through HEPA filtration before return) 12, 13. Some states require the availability of such rooms in hospitals, emergency departments, and nursing homes that care for patients with M. tuberculosis. A respiratory protection program that includes education about use of respirators, fit-testing, and user seal checks is required in any facility with AIIRs. In settings where Airborne Precautions cannot be implemented due to limited engineering resources (e.g., physician offices), masking the patient, placing the patient in a private room (e.g., office examination room) with the door closed, and providing N95 or higher level respirators or masks if respirators are not available for healthcare personnel will reduce the likelihood of airborne transmission until the patient is either transferred to a facility with an AIIR or returned to the home environment, as deemed medically appropriate. Healthcare personnel caring for patients on Airborne Precautions wear a mask or respirator, depending on the disease-specific recommendations (Respiratory Protection II.E.4, Table 2, and Appendix A), that is donned prior to room entry. Whenever possible, non-immune HCWs should not care for patients with vaccine-preventable airborne diseases (e.g., measles, chickenpox, and smallpox)</p>

<p><a href="http://virologydownunder.blogspot.com/2014/08/ebola-virus-may-be-spread-by-droplets.html">Here&#39;s a nice link explaining the subtle difference between the &quot;aerosolized&quot; transmission and &quot;airborne transmission&quot; and why those differences matter when it comes to understanding how the virus is spread.</a>  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a quote from <strong>Evaluation of transmission risks associated with in vivo replication of several high containment pathogens in a biosafety level 4 laboratory</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Containment level 4 (CL4) laboratories studying biosafety level 4 viruses are under strict regulations to conduct nonhuman primate (NHP) studies in compliance of both animal welfare and biosafety requirements. NHPs housed in open-barred cages raise concerns about cross-contamination between animals, and accidental exposure of personnel to infectious materials. To address these concerns, two NHP experiments were performed. One examined the simultaneous infection of 6 groups of NHPs with 6 different viruses (Machupo, Junin, Rift Valley Fever, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever, Nipah and Hendra viruses). Washing personnel between handling each NHP group, floor to ceiling biobubble with HEPA filter, and plexiglass between cages were employed for partial primary containment. The second experiment employed no primary containment around open barred cages with Ebola virus infected NHPs 0.3 meters from naïve NHPs. Viral antigen-specific ELISAs, qRT-PCR and TCID50 infectious assays were utilized to determine antibody levels and viral loads. No transmission of virus to neighbouring NHPs was observed suggesting limited containment protocols are sufficient for multi-viral CL4 experiments within one room. <strong>The results support the concept that Ebola virus infection is self-contained in NHPs infected intramuscularly, at least in the present experimental conditions, and is not transmitted to naïve NHPs via an airborne route.</strong></p>

<p>There are even problems with airborne transmission of ebov Zaire by people <strong>who are literally trying to make it airborne</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aerosol models of filovirus infection have been developed in knock-out mice, guinea pigs and non-human primates; however, filovirus infection of immunocompetent mice by the aerosol route has not been reported.</p>

<p>This is where all the confusion stems from. Its nice how you differentiste between airborne transmission amd droplet transmission. I just wanted to point out, per all the misunderstandings on this topic, that the two are different, but, if the droplets travel through the air, by definition, that is airborne. Though, the clinical definition is obviously much more strict thst the common dictionarys definition. </p>

<p>Anyhow, this is where all the confusion and arguments are coming from. Technically, droplet transmission can be considered, by definition, to be airborne, but, in the case of ebola, it doesnt quite meet the requirements for them to slap the &quot;clinical&quot; label of &quot;airborne&quot; to it.</p>

<p>Nice citations, too, btw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While much of the argument can appear superficially to be likened to  everyday vs proper scientific use of the word &quot;theory&quot; this <em>critical</em> misconception leads to a misunderstanding of the nature of the virus, the qualities which it possesses, its modes of transmission, what constitutes proper protection, isolation and containment of the virus, and ultimately how it can/should best be treated or contained.</p>

<p>Attempting to shoehorn &quot;aerosloized transmission&quot; to mean &quot;airborne transmission&quot; is to misrepresent the nature of the virus.  Disinformation, however innocent, or well intentioned is always counterproductive.</p>

<p>Imo, this goes both ways. For, without the differentiation of &quot;clinical&quot; terminology vs &quot;laymans&quot; terminology, to say definitively either way is a bit disingenuous.</p>

<p>For instance, to &quot;shoehorn&quot; the differences between &quot;aerosolized transmission&quot; and &quot;airborne&quot; transmission without considering the difference of perspective in terms of prerequisite attributes between the two paradigms can be seen as disinformation, as well, whatever the intentions or motives.</p>

<p>So, to definitively state that ebola is absolutely not airborne, without acknowleding that by definition (per every dictionary from oxford to webster-merriam) even aerosolized transmission happens through the air, is to allow one to conclude, ignorantly, that ebola absolutely cannot be transmitted through the air, when in fact, it is certainly possible.</p>

<p>It goes both ways. We cant say definitively that it absolutely IS airborne, as this is ignorant of the clinical definitions and requirements for such a label. And, in parallel, we cant say definitively that it IS NOT airborne, as this is ignorant of the nature of the virions to be able to infect another person whilst travelling on droplets <em>through the air.</em></p>

<p>Again, the distinctiin is between laymans terms and clinical terms, which are often (not limited to ebola and airbirn transmission) two very different things.</p>

<p>To state it is one way without acknowledging the validity of the other perspective is biased, and cements a certain level of failing in regards to proper communication between experts and common-folk alike.</p>

<p>To be clear, i agree that, clinically speaking, ebola is not considered to be an airborne virus, as is influenza. But at the same time, i acknowledge that it is possible, though ineffective, for ebola to be transmitted through the air.</p>

<p>I partly agree. But then again, i partly disagree. Ill explain:</p>

<p>If it is intended to release ebola for the purpose of culling the population, ebola isnt the best virus (at least in its natural form, they have already weaponized it, though.) There are far better choices. Thats when i agree.</p>

<p>But, if it is intended only to disseminate fear, the fundamental motive of &quot;terrorism&quot;, then ebola is quite the choice option. It dkesnt need to kill lkts of folks, its just got to be scary. The flu kills hundreds of thousands of people a year, every year. Ebola has only killd a few thousand. Statistically, the flu should be much more feared for this reason alone. Yet, it is often disregarded as &quot;JUST&quot; the flu...</p>

<p>Wjth ebola as a bioterror weapon, all they need to do is incite fear. Just the mentioning of ebola does exactly that. In this manner, ebola is certsinly the perfect choice.</p>

<p>But, realisticslly, this is only if it is spread intentionally for malicious reasons, which i beljeve is a differemt discussion...</p>

<p>Given the current situation it&#39;s not so difficult for terrorists to fly over there, get some material and release it where ever they like in the western world (or keep it in a fridge and use it when the opportunity arises). For example, on the tube.</p>

<p>All of our current defenses deal with explosives, conventional weapons, etc. Ebola is a completely different animal. I think part of it hinges on how well it survives in a vial and so on.

    <div class="md"><p>Ebola only spreads through liquid contact and has no vermin vectors.. Not a very viable weapon unless you figure out how to aerosolize it. In a first world country where people have flushing toilets and wash their hands even once a day a virus like Ebola doesn&#39;t have much of a chance of becoming epidemic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think distributing it as an aerosol or however needed is a major hurdle.</p>

<p>In a &quot;first world&quot; country people might engage in basic hygiene practices but that doesn&#39;t mean we aren&#39;t massively overcrowded. Overcrowding presents a significant problem on its own whether people wash their hands or not (we still have things like flu and what we might have to do to prevent spread in a crowded urban environment could be highly disruptive) however the objectives of the terrorists isn&#39;t necessarily to make an epidemic. It&#39;s to terrorise and Ebola could do that quite well.</p>

They told us WHO and Doctors Without Borders were wrong.  They changed the page on the CDC dealing with whether or not Ebola was airborne about 5 times since this started.  Now they admit that it can be caught through the air if you come within 3 feet of an infected person, or are in an enclosed room.  Which is why there have already been 3 people forced off planes in the past 2 days into quarantine, for sneezing, a headache, and a fever.</p>

I wouldn&#39;t put it past these psychopaths in the shadow government to unleash a disease on the population. I think they know the planet is fucked and there&#39;s too many people and not enough resources so some of us gotta go. They probably believe they&#39;re doing us all a favor.

<p>&quot;Unfortunately, the news was accompanied by worsening statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), which announced on Friday that out of the roughly <strong>4,000</strong> people that have been confirmed to have the virus, <strong>2,105 people</strong> have died in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria.&quot;</p>

<p>2,105/4,000= approx <strong>53%</strong> have died.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/</a></p>

<p>&quot;EVD outbreaks have a case fatality rate of up to <strong>90%</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>If this was real Ebola, shouldn&#39;t the death toll be around 3,600 out of 4,000?</p>

<p>Either the virus has mutated into a more communicable and <strong>less</strong> deadly form or this isn&#39;t true &quot;Ebola&quot;.  I would think if a virus mutated to this degree it would become more deadly, not less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Usually when a virus naturally mutates, it becomes more deadly, not less. And I don&#39;t know if this is related but there has been quite a few suspicious deaths of microbiologists. </p>

<p>On 9/11, it seems like they deliberately tried to keep the death toll low. Their goal was to kill just enough people to scare the population and get Congress to bend over and let them put their plans in motion to invade the middle east and pass the Patriot Act. All 4 of the planes were under capacity.  The Twin Towers should have been full of people because they attacked during work hours yet only 1,700 or so people died in the towers and then the Pentagon was hit in the section that was mostly empty due to the recent renovation. </p>

<p>And coincidentally,  FEMA was running training exercises in both New York City and Washington dc along with first responders to respond to a terrorist threat so they were able to immediately respond to the attacks. </p>

<p>Training exercises are a tell tale sign of a false flag attack and the government has been running alot of them over the past year. I suspect it&#39;s either going to be a biological attack, which they&#39;ve already done with the Anthrax attack or a nuke, either a dirty bomb or a suitcase nuke. When you have both Obama and Dick Cheney warning against a nuclear bomb, it&#39;s time to sit up and take notice. </p>

<p>The 2008 outbreak of the EBOV strain in DR Congo had a CFR of 45%. The 1996 Gabon outbreak was 57%.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have dedicated a lot of my free time to research of Ebola and all of which it entails. Its amazing, the determination that a virus has to survive,  I should also mention, parasite as well. [The recent Ebola outbreak in Congo has proved to be similar to that of Ebola Zaire, which was indeed a parasite.] I have posted many links to this thread, many responses to peoples theories and even exaggerated my own. However, it seems the crazier my personal theories get, the more cracked the situation in real life becomes.</p>

<p>There are currently 2 Ebola outbreaks, both which we have absolutely no control over. We have no idea where it started, why or how. We do not have the means or pull to execute a vaccine faster than mutation rates of said virus. As far as the parasite, I am not sure on the mutation
process, if any. I do know that none of this makes any sense.</p>

<p>In fact, no matter what excuses that are to occur, there is just no lie big enough to cover this mess up. What may have started as an accident, or on purpose has started taking its own course. </p>

<p>So, even I propose, what is next?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Explain your whole &quot;parasite&quot; assertion, please. </p>

<p>As i understand it, Marburgs virus (another filovirus, a cousin of ebola, if you will, with incredibly similar symptoms) is suspected to be transmitted by mosquitos and other pests, though it is not conclusive, yet. Ebola, on the other hand, again, as i understand it from my research, has not been proven, nor shown, nor even suspected to be transmitted through a mosquitos bite, or any other pests for thst matter.</p>

<p>So, i was just curious if you could expound on your mentioning of &quot;parasite&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ebola Zaire attacks every organ and tissue in the human body except skeletal muscle and bone. It is a perfect parasite because it transforms virtually every part of the body into a digested slime of virus particles. The seven mysterious proteins that, assembled together, make up the Ebola-virus particle, work as a relentless machine, a molecular shark, and they consume the body as the virus makes copies of itself.

    <div class="md"><p>I meant the parasite comment. I didnt need the condescension, either.</p>

<p>But, i figured out that viruses are considered &quot;microparasites&quot;, specifically intracellular microparasites. This is what i was asking about. </p>

<p>Its not the conventional parasite, which is one living organism that benefits in a relationship with its host, whereas the host does not share those benefits. Furthermore, viruses are not considered to be true living organisms, hence my questioning as to why you were refering to it as a parasite. I wasnt aware of the sub-classes of the term &quot;parasite&quot; to include viruses in the &quot;intracellular microparasite&quot; category.</p>

<p>So, i hope you see now why i was curious as to why you kept referring to it as a &quot;parasite,&quot; when most people refer to it as a virus. Both labels apparantly fit, as i found out on my own.</p>

For some reason, while everyone else in the entire world was saying that this version was airborne, and a risk to the world, <em>we</em> were saying (we being the CDC and the President) that Ebola isn&#39;t airborne and never was, and that there was no risk of it spreading to other countries, <em>anywhere</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh im not, but if you wanted to know my position on the matter there are plenty of comments in this thread ive submitted that highlights such.</p>

<p>I acknowledge the &quot;clinical&quot; terminology of &quot;airborne&quot;, whereas ebola shouldnt be considered (currently) airborne. But i also acknowledge the technical (laymans) terminology, whereas using mere definition of &quot;airborne&quot; and the fact that ebola can actually be transmitted, albeit ineffeciently, through the air, it can be considered as such from that perspective.</p>

<p>I only argue the difference is really in semantics, where in the clinical perspective, it cannot be considered airborne because it doesnt fit their strict criteria to be labelled as such, regardless of the fact that it can be transmitted through the air, which, by definition only, is airborne transmission. </p>

<p>I also acknowledge the important difference between the clinical definitions vs the &quot;normal&quot; definitions, which often (not limited to ebolas transmissibility) are two very different perspectives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you are saying. there is a fine line in Airborne transmission.</p>

<p>In reality any diseaswe can be considered Airborne.</p>

<p>Take Gastrointestinal worms for instance.</p>

<p>If I pick up some poo and toss it at you and it hit you in the face and you get a tape worm, technically I Just infected you with an Airborne Parasite.</p>

<p>I still hold that no one thought that Africa could go this full on that they have.</p>

<p>What we have is Mass Hysteria in Africa and a total breakdown of being able to contain it because of it.</p>

<p>Past infections have been very well contained. But when you hit the poorest of the poor in areas where trust is non existant, it makes it hard to apply the same tactics.</p>

<p>Sure there is risk of a spread but outside the third world better quarantine and better behaved patients will stop the infection before it gets out of control. The sad part is that unless we all submit to daily screenings it has a huge chance of outbreak in a First World Nation and that is all due to the Mass Hysteria in the already infected areas.</p>

<p>The Outbreak will  probably not be small. By the time it is identified as highly mobile as a country like the USA is there is enough time between ID and our very mobile in contact society to spread it. But I don&#39;t think that there will be a problem with containment.</p>

<p>We also have to look at the Disease Vector besides human to human and that right now the results are inconclusive but it thought that it is a natural part of rural Africa. If this vector is not present anywhere else and a new Vector does not develop which would be the scary scenario that it finds a new better vector host in the USA then continued outbreak once contained is unlikely. There is no way for it to sit dormant outside of its Vectors Habitat.</p>

<p>Thats an enterovirus, which is interesting you brought that up because there is apparantly a new outbreak of enterovirus d68 in the united states, that has gotten hundreds of kids sick already. Which is almost alarming, considering that in the past several years less thsn a hundred cases were found, total.</p>

<p>Im not implying anything, just pointing it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it&#39;s an escaped biological weapon, it wouldn&#39;t be the first time. Neuroborreliosis is alleged to have escaped from the Plum Island research facility (which also studied foot &amp; mouth).</p>

<p>SARS &amp; MERS are their own weird story. Besides their names, which sound just a little too similar to the Russian for &quot;plague&quot; and &quot;filth,&quot; respectively, to be coincidental, they are both variants of coronavirus (responsible for another common cold). Moreover, if I remember correctly, they can be carried by bats, which to me indicates that they are of anthropogenic origin (like light pollution can cause birds to fall ill, same with sound pollution for bats).</p>

<p>I would suggest they name the next coronavirus plague &quot;CURS&quot; - Canonically Upgraded Respiratory Syndrome.</p>

<p>You yourself admitted that it&#39;s contagious in aerosol and as we&#39;ve been over aerosol is an airborne route.</p>

<p>False.</p>

<p><strong>aerosol is NOT the same as airborne</strong> Despite your repeated claims otherwise.</p>

<p>Yes, aerosol transmission is bad, however, <em>airborne transmission</em> is much, much worse.  For a disease to be transmissible by aerosol, the uninfected person must be in close contact with the infected person.  For a disease to be truly <em>airborne</em> has much more to deal with how far the virus can travel.  </p>

<p>If a disease to be transmitted by aerosol, they guy whose face you cough in will get the disease.  If it&#39;s airborne, so will the guy across the room, and possibly the one down the hall.  <em>That</em> is the difference.  This picture might help illustrate my point.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Explain your whole &quot;parasite&quot; assertion, please. </p>

<p>As i understand it, Marburgs virus (another filovirus, a cousin of ebola, if you will, with incredibly similar symptoms) is suspected to be transmitted by mosquitos and other pests, though it is not conclusive, yet. Ebola, on the other hand, again, as i understand it from my research, has not been proven, nor shown, nor even suspected to be transmitted through a mosquitos bite, or any other pests for thst matter.</p>

<p>So, i was just curious if you could expound on your mentioning of &quot;parasite&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough.  </p>

<p>Perhaps over the years, I have grown too accustomed to the rhetoric of scientific discourse which is deliberately peckish, prudish and pedantic (but for good and valid reasons).  </p>

<p>In the desire to describe and understand observed phenomena as precisely as possible given state of all currently available evidence on that particular topic, minutiae which would seem insignificant in normal conversation must necessarily become topics of intense scrutiny and debate within the scientific community.</p>

<p>Perhaps, if anything, I&#39;m arguing that the general public needs to be more educated on what these terms mean in the scientific community in order to avoid such misinterpretations(and their almost inevitable distortions in mainstream/nonscientific media).  </p>

<p>And of of course, by saying this I do not mean to pejoratively imply that the general public is uneducated, unimpassioned, or ignorant with regard to scientific topics, far from it. </p>

<p>Rather, the responsibility to promote knowledge falls upon the educated and the scientific community and the public at large are both best served by concerted efforts to better communicate the facts, in order to more easily facilitate a common discourse on some of the most important questions we all face as human beings from microscopic to cosmic.</p>

<p>Given that the content of my discussion with <a href="/u/EidolonofNight">/u/EidolonofNight</a> over the past 2 days has not moved beyond the mere possibility of aerosolized transmission, we have not been able to advance into a discussion of the likelihood of transmission by this route, its rate of occurrence, or its impact on viral transmission in any setting beyond the laboratory (and most evidence seems to indicate that this is not a primary or even statistically significant route of infection) all of which are far more important and germane to any rational discussion of the current ebov Zaire outbreak.</p>

<p>The problem is that when terms such as &#39;airborne transmission&#39; are used publicly without providing a clear definition of what is intended by that term is that it allows for all manner of speculation and inaccuracy to be perpetuated.  </p>

<p>The horrific nature of symptoms sufferred by ebov Zaire victims coupled with recent pop culture depictions of hemmoragic fevers (Outbreak and the like) facilitate an environment in which it is both easy and understandable for the general public to develop disproportionate fears based on little to no factual information about the virus itself. And as we all know, there would be no shortage of opportunists available to potentially take advantage of the climate of fear raised around a particularly horrible disease such as this.  And therein lies the danger of using improperly defined terms. </p>

<p>For instance, if the hypothetical headline <strong>&quot;WHO continues to deny airborne transmission of ebola&quot;</strong> were to be printed....while truthful, to a certain degree, would actually be misleading, because the average reader not be likely to infer from this (unless it is explicitly stated in the accompanying text) that the scientific community uses a different definition of the term &quot;airborne&quot;.</p>

<p>Similarly, random, unevidenced postings on the internet that &quot;ebola is airborne!&quot; are disingenuous, do nothing to describe the state of the current events, often serve little purpose other than to sensationalize the current situation and foster a climate of misunderstanding in which the actual medical facts of the situation are often obscured, distorted, or just plain left by the wayside.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think distributing it as an aerosol or however needed is a major hurdle.</p>

<p>In a &quot;first world&quot; country people might engage in basic hygiene practices but that doesn&#39;t mean we aren&#39;t massively overcrowded. Overcrowding presents a significant problem on its own whether people wash their hands or not (we still have things like flu and what we might have to do to prevent spread in a crowded urban environment could be highly disruptive) however the objectives of the terrorists isn&#39;t necessarily to make an epidemic. It&#39;s to terrorise and Ebola could do that quite well.</p>
