I&#39;m really pumped about this paper, I LOVE conspiracies. On the back of our prompt are the mainstream conspiracies like: Area 51, JFK, 1969 Moon landing, Marilyn Monroe, AIDs, Fluoride, Roswell, 9-11, Big foot, but I want something that&#39;s interesting, and that will blow people away. I know of some other conspiracies, but I think they&#39;re a little far fetched to do an English paper on. If anyone knows of some other amazingly interesting conspiracies, it would be awesome if you would share the name, and a little about it so I can further research the topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m very keen on the moon landing conspiracy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s special since I truly believed that we landed on the moon, and would even argue against a friend who thought the moon landings were a fraud.</p>

<p>After the idea had been seriously suggested to me, I would consider the possibility that the conspiracy theory was true, and everything made more sense.</p>

<p>The March 2013 National Geographic dedicates a two page spread to advising other spacefaring powers to follow our policy and stay 0.5km<sup>unsure</sup> <sup>of</sup> <sup>distance</sup> away from ALL moon landing sites &quot;to preserve lunar history&quot;.  Time ran a cover story advising in favor of the policy.away  seeing news stories related to I considered the possibility that we did not in fact land on the moon.  A bi-partisan bill was introduced to make 8<sup>+-1</sup> Apollo sites and some area at least 1km around them equivalent to US National Parks under law.  </p>

<p>Lunar history?  If we actually had landed on the moon, observing and photographing the footprints and the flagpoles and the rovers years later seems like the only way to have ANY lunar history.  Am expedition of explorers stuck a flagpole in the most exotic place every, and they don&#39;t want anyone ever allowed within a kilometer of it?  The history we have from those alleged landings sucks.  All the moon landing videos are recorded off of TVs, and none of the astronauts from the apollo missions really spoke or interviewed much afterwards.  I wouldn&#39;t minds some &quot;50 Years Laters&quot; photos taken by a new country who is exploring the moon.  That would be history.  To me this stuff seemed like warnings to other countries to not go near our moon landing sites.  Just on cue, the Chinese sent their first rover to the moon, which explored some new area far away from our sites.</p>

<p>The wikipedia page for &quot;Third Party Evidence&quot; of the moon landing is also pitiful.  They show a photo of a landscape taken by a Japanese rover, saying it is the same landscape seen in the film of an Apollo mission.  OMG, if you saw that landscape, get a shot of a footprint!!!  Some sand dunes in the background which look like the ones from an Apollo mission doesn&#39;t convince me.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m a pretty young guy.  I remember when I was little.  I was shown the moon landing videos real early.  I thought it was inevitable that we would go to Mars and then keep going.  Now I see that no man has ever set foot on any rock in space, and none of the current powers seem to be trying to do get men to the mars or the moon or anything outside of a tight orbit around the earth.  We did it 6 times between 1969 and 1972, back and forth like the Jetsons, and after 45 years of tremendous progress in all areas of science and technology, everyone is acting like this previous achievement is unthinkable?</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t alive back then!  I don&#39;t just believe that we landed on the the moon because I was told so in kindergarten and everyone else thinks so.  Why are people taught that only insane people think that we didn&#39;t land on the moon?  We hadn&#39;t even sent an unmanned craft for a round trip (the Russians had), and we winning the space race was a military of strategic importance.  It might have been decided that rather than taking the years, dollars, and risked lives to actually develop a means of for landing men on another astronomical body, that we could just win the space race outright by sending the men out far into orbit, and broadcasting some super high budget film of astronauts on the moon.</p>

<p>I have good reason to doubt the conventional story.</p>

<p>The general lack of good pictures/video/astronaut interviews &amp; speeches,</p>

<p>the way that people are so deeply programmed to believe it,</p>

<p>modern day propaganda warnings for others to stay away from out landing sites,</p>

<p>and a fact of history that has been revealed by mankind&#39;s behavior since 1969:</p>

<p>Landing on the moon/mars/anything is IMPOSSIBLY challenging.</p>

<p>So much so that no space program has since seriously considered doing attempting it.  This is with 45 years of advancement, including in space exploration.  And I&#39;m told that we did it like it was nothing decade(s) before I was born, and that I should believe it since you saw it on TV?</p>

<p>If I am asked to believe that we landed on the Moon based on faith, I ain&#39;t gonna just believe it.  The burden of proof is on the people who claim to have FUCKING WALKED ON THE MOON.  They did it a ton of times, with many astronauts each time, with rovers and golf!  I&#39;ve seen snippets of video of them up there!  Now can I just get a little bit more proof than a few photos and slightly damaged videos?  The evidence I&#39;ve seen hasn&#39;t convinced me that we landed on the moon.  And this new push from some establishment to make it an act of aggression to go near our moon landing sites convinced me that we never landed on the moon.  So long as the US empire stands, we will not be made to swallow that proud lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything else aside, the fact that questioning the moon landing runs a close second to holocaust denial in terms of how bad it is for your reputation does seem a bit fishy.</p>

<p>Whenever there&#39;s a &quot;how dare you&quot; response to questioning something, you know you&#39;re onto something, especially when there seem to be very compelling reasons why one might lie about it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s become such a conspiracy-theorist cliché to question the moon landings that no one touches it anymore unless they want to completely destroy their credibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I think that has a lot to do with how the Holocaust and the Moon Landings are taught to everybody in school starting at a very young age.  People who hear that you don&#39;t believe these things think, &quot;Are you serious?  They taught me about that in kindergarden, how stupid are you for not knowing that we landed on the moon/Hitler killed 10 million innocent Jews in cold blood?&quot;</p>

<p>People also don&#39;t understand that doubting the official stories of these historical events doesn&#39;t mean that I deny EVERYTHING.  Even though I don&#39;t believe that the Apollo missions went as reported, I do believe the full details of nearly all other space missions.  Similarly, I disagree that the Nazis should be remembered foremost for their crimes against the European Jews, but I DO obviously concede that the Nazis had work/concentration/death camps where 10,000,000+ people of many sorts were killed with many Jews among then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, calling into question any aspect at all of the official holocaust story = DENIAL (even if your thesis is that it was 5 million and not 6 million).</p>

<p>Same with climate change. Not agreeing with the most pessimistic predictions = DENIAL.</p>

<p>I guess the strategy does work, so I understand why they use it. I&#39;d like to use it too for my own agendas if I could do it while keeping a straight face.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny, really. I <em>want</em> to believe the moon landing story hook, line and sinker, but once I encountered the hypothesis that it was faked, it introduced a bit of doubt that I&#39;ve never been able to put to rest. </p>

<p>Why can&#39;t they just produce some real, solid evidence to refute the claims against them? I ask. The stance seems to be that to do so is beneath them, or that because to doubt them is indicative of a pathological obsession with conspiracies, even if they did provide evidence, we&#39;d just call that into question and be back at square one.</p>

<p>They point at your lack of faith and try to make you feel ashamed.</p>

<p>But, seriously, why be so indignant? If I accomplished something outrageous, like say.. I am the first man to swim unassisted to the bottom of the Marianas Trench. Would I really be so insulted if someone asked for better proof than my GoPro video where it&#39;s mostly black with a few bubbles??</p>

<p>I really wish they could just do us all a solid and sincerely answer the questions without mockery and without pathetically casting aspersions about the mental health of the asker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;PNAC&quot; was a conspiracy of Neocons who fantasized about a &quot;New Pearl Harbor&quot; and an invasion of Iraq, one year before Bush became president.</p>

<p>They also fantasized about bioweapons designed to kill specific genetics, such as only-blue-eyed-people or only-dark-skinned-people:</p>

I&#39;m going to try to find everyone involed in the set up of 9-11 and research them and see what role each person played, same thing with organisations, and government administrations, etc. I&#39;m gonna blow this paper away, and everyone will worship me when it&#39;s done.

<p>You&#39;re biting off more than you can chew.  There are dozens of books about this.  Your paper would be thousands of pages long.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Another-Nineteen-Investigating-Legitimate-Suspects/dp/1489507833/ref=as_li_wdgt_ex?&amp;amp;linkCode=wsw&amp;amp;tag=besofthelef-20">This book</a> names 19 people &quot;involved in the set-up of 9/11&quot;.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t read that book, here are 5 hours of interviews with the author which discuss the 19 suspected individuals:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kpfa.org/archive/show/34/2013/08">http://www.kpfa.org/archive/show/34/2013/08</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.kpfa.org/archive/id/95210">http://www.kpfa.org/archive/id/95210</a></p>

<p>You should skip the first hour -- start with any other hour -- then end with the first hour, which is background information.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t buy the book, the author has <a href="http://www.digwithin.net">many articles on the Internet and his website that contain chapters from the book</a>.</p>

<p>If I were you, I&#39;d skip trying to explain the entirety of 9/11 for your project and work on a much smaller project, such as &quot;Who were PNAC and what did they want&quot;.  PNAC contains many of the probable 9/11 conspirators who were later in the Bush Administration and government.  Looking to explain &quot;everyone in 9/11&quot; will take you years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, how a group of international bankers took over the power to create money out of thin air, then loan it to the American Govt which in turn pays the international bankers interest on the money it never had (just created). If that&#39;s not the biggest and best gangster scheme in history I don&#39;t know what is. You loan a Govt (the people) money you never had, just conjured up, and loaned it to them then get paid billions in interest on the same damn loan into your nasty greedy damn pockets? Wow.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0912986212?pc_redir=1410060717&amp;amp;robot_redir=1">http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0912986212?pc_redir=1410060717&amp;amp;robot_redir=1</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would start at the JFK assassination and really do a good job. Blow people&#39;s minds, debunk the lone gunman. Don&#39;t treat it as a theory because it&#39;s not a theory anywhere outside of mainstream american hive-mind. It&#39;s the truth, and there are a lot of sources. Ignore any theory that points to one single perpetrator organization, because it was compartmentalized by the CIA, FBI, Joint Chiefs, Secret Service, Dallas PD and the Mafia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>John Mohammad, the DC sniper, stopped his reign of terror after police followed his demand to read a strange note on the airwaves he was monitoring.  The note contained the impossible to come across phrase from a Cherokee folk tale, and the police stated &quot;we understand it&#39;s very important for you to hear us say &#39;caught like a duck in a noose&#39; &quot;.  Shortly after the phrase was read, Mohammad pulled over in a rest stop,   <strong>put his wallet on the roof of the car</strong>,  and went to sleep. He was, of course captured immediately.  The implication is that he was brainwashed or hypnotized and the bizzare phrase functioned as a release trigger to signal him to end his mission.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To &quot;blow their minds,&quot; id suggest something incredibly controversial. And, imo, nothing is more controversial than religion. Id suggest looking into the ancient sumerian texts and the dead sea scrolls, learn as much as you can about the annunaki, as well as the (!!) <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_apocrypha">Biblical Apocrypha</a>.</p>

<p>For a quick rundown, the leaders of the catholic church convened in a series of councils, the first being the <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea">Council of Nicea</a>. During this meeting, they discussed which books were to be canonized (accepted) into the bible, and which ones were to be thrown out (these make up the apocrypha). The theory here is that they threw out the books that did not follow their preconceived idea of what christianity should be. They dismissed books like The Book of Enoch, which explained in incredible detail how angels took him to heaven where he met god. But, he explains it in such a way that makes it seem like these were extraterrestrials, not celestrial beings. </p>

<p>It is also important to look into the freemasons and how they revere Enoch in many ways. </p>

<p>Anyhow, the premise i am suggesting is that all religions, particularily the main ones (the abrahamic three, christianity, islam, and judaism) were actually originated in misinterpreted (by modern folks) encounters with real, flesh and blood, beings. Not celestrial angels or gods.</p>

<p>As a bonus, ill tell you about a historic presedence for this phenomena. Back in ww1 (or ww2, i forget), the allies found an island in the pacific that served wonderfully as a strategic base where they can resupply their troops and planes and ships amd stuff. However, they found an indigenous population of humans there, untouched by modern technology and culture. They gave these people food and helped them in all kinds of ways. Then, after the war, the allies packed up amd left a lonely indigenous population behind.</p>

<p>A few years later, they went back, and found thst those people had formed a religion based on the allies benevolence, and even created wooden effigies of the airplanes to try and honor them as gods, in an attempt to bring them back once again.</p>

<p>When you look into the ancient texts concerning the annunaki, you can see how much the two actually parallel eachother.</p>

<p>Just a suggestion...</p>
