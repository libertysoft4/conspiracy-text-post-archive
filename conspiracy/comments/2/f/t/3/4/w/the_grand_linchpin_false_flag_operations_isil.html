        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Forewarning:  This will be, I suspect, a rather lengthy post which will require an extended period of time to read. There will not be a tl;dr because I believe  it is important to read through  this in its entirety in order to have a solid understanding  of the thesis which a condensed tidbit message cannot convey.</p>

<p>con•spir•a•cy
 <em>noun</em> \kən-ˈspir-ə-sē\
: a secret plan made by two or more people to do something that is harmful or illegal</p>

<p>Before I delve into the crux of my theory I would like to first begin discussion on the nature of conspiracies themselves and how I came to take an interest in the underworld of treachery. For it wasn&#39;t too long ago that I counted myself as being among rank within the legion of derisive skeptics who incredulously dismiss any notion of possible unlawful doing by persons of power. The very notion that certain actors of authority would be willing to participate in abhorrent deeds so as to further their own ends is something I would naively brush aside as absurd. Little was I aware at the time, however, of the long and sordid background of not only the United States, but of perverse groups rooted in every polity throughout human history. </p>

<p>Looking back now, it seems ridiculous to have ever denied that people would readily engage in nefarious and underhanded tactics as a means of consolidating power. After all, is that not an inherent component of humanity’s past? In World War 1 alone, for instance, there were at least two major conspiracies which took place that most reasonable people would agree dramatically affected the path of the 20th century.  The first of these being the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand which is, as you might be aware, very well documented and not denied by historians. </p>

<p>The very creation of the Black Hand was reminiscent of a stereotypical shadow organization <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hand_(Serbia)#Birth_of_the_Black_Hand">spawned by a small group of powerful men who shared a similar ideology</a>: “The Black Hand was formed when ten men met on 9 May 1911 to form Ujedinjenje ili Smrt (Unification or Death), better known as the Black Hand…the professed goal of the group was the creation of a Greater Serbia, by use of violence, if necessary”. Not only did they just kill Franz Ferdinand however, but they also murdered their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Coup_(Serbia)">own King and Queen in a coup</a> years before, shortly after their inception. </p>

<p>As you can see, they very obviously fit the definition of a traditional conspiracy. In fact, it would be almost comical how boilerplate they truly were if it hadn’t been for the seriousness of the matter. And before it is mentioned how that the Balkans was the “powerkeg of Europe” and that WWI was going to happen regardless, I do not deny the fact that the socio-political policies of that era were bound to inevitably erupt into conflict.  This is beside the point.  The fact of the matter is that there was indeed a conspiracy to provoke war by a group of people who believed they would benefit from it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslavia">And they were right</a>. </p>

<p>The second less discussed conspiracy is the intentional sinking of the RMS Lusitania. This unsavory fact of WWI receives less attention overall in the history books than does the Black Hand, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Lusitania#Conspiracies">although that is not to say that it’s ignored altogether by historians either</a>: “There has long been a theory, expressed by historian and former British naval intelligence officer Patrick Beesly and authors Colin Simpson and Donald E. Schmidt among others, that Lusitania was deliberately placed in danger by the British authorities, so as to entice a U-Boat attack and thereby drag the USA into the war on the side of Britain. A week before the sinking of the Lusitania, Winston Churchill wrote to Walter Runciman, the President of the Board of Trade, stating that it is ‘most important to attract neutral shipping to our shores, in the hope especially of embroiling the United States with Germany’. Beesly concludes: ‘unless and until fresh information comes to light, I am reluctantly driven to the conclusion that there was a conspiracy deliberately to put the Lusitania at risk in the hope that even an abortive attack on her would bring the United States into the war. Such a conspiracy could not have been put into effect without Winston Churchill&#39;s express permission and approval&quot;.</p>

<p>Furthermore is the fact that just prior to WWI, the Cunard Steamship Company in England had received a subsidy which allowed the government to participate in the design of the ship, which included a secret compartment where weapons and ammunitions could be stored aboard ship. Worse still is that “<a href="http://books.google.co.za/books?id=6U-o9At__2cC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=patrick+Beesly,+lusitania&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lcm-UYTMIeHb7AaMo4C4AQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">as the Lusitania drew near to its final destination, orders came from the British Admiralty to the military escort ship, the Juno, to abandon its usual mission, thereby leaving the ocean liner without protection from submarines</a>”. To this day the British government continues to keep hidden the true nature of the Lusitania’s sinking by refusing to release certain documents of the doomed ship’s final days. </p>

<p>These are just two specific examples of conspiracy within the last century. There are many others which are permeated throughout all of human history.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Catilinarian_conspiracy">The Catiline conspiracy</a> to stage a rebellion against the Roman republic, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisonian_conspiracy">Pisonian plot</a> led by Gaius Calpiurnius Piso to overthrow Nero and have himself installed as emperor, and of course the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Julius_Caesar">assassination of Julius Caesar</a> are three further instances of conspiracy going all the way back to antiquity. This isn’t to mention cases like the murder of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew,_Duke_of_Calabria#Murder_and_aftermath">Duke Andrew</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pazzi_conspiracy">the Pazzi conspiracy</a>, <a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/washington-puts-an-end-to-the-newburgh-conspiracy">the Newburgh conspiracy</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot">the Gunpowder plot</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_affair">the Dreyfus affair</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Credit_and_Commerce_International#Lending_practices">the BCCI scandal</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleiwitz_incident">the Gleiwitz incident</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_July_plot">the July 20 plot</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Abraham_Lincoln">and the Lincoln assassination</a>. This is without delving into the specifically American-related conspiracies of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment">Tuskegee syphilis experiment</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_(testimony)">the 1990 testimony of Nayirah</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair">the Iran-Contra affair</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO">COINTELPRO</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird">operation Mockingbird</a>,  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">operation Ajax</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gladio">operation Gladio</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Snow_White">operation snow white</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip">operation paperclip</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HODxnUrFX6k">the Gulf of Tonkin incident</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot">the business plot</a>,  or <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/30/ron-paul-conspiracy-theory-cia-drug-traffickers_n_1176103.html">CIA drug running in LA</a>. Sometimes conspiracies even take on a more mundane form such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sox_Scandal">1919 World Series Black Sox scandal</a>. </p>

<p>To deny that conspiracies are very much a reality of power is not to refute their existence. On the contrary, it’s to bury ones head in the sand in the hopes that the truth will disappear. As such, I pose the following question to the reader: At what point does it become delusional, not to propose such theories, but rather, to vehemently deny their possibility? </p>

<p>While the methods and purposes of these conspiracies might have differed to varying degrees, what is universally true is that they existed. They were real. They happened.  And yet there persists in our society this idea that conspiracies are confined to the realms of lunacy and paranoia. That mental illness is inseparable from the people who would be wary of their government’s intentions. Why is it though, that self-proclaimed “skeptics” should be allowed to possess a monopoly on what sanity is?</p>

<p>At this point the reader might question my use of quotations around “skeptics”.  My reasoning is so:  Skeptics play an integral role in ascertaining an objective view of reality. However, skepticism is not the same thing as reinforcing the official account of things. Indeed, a conspiracy theory can be argued as an alternative to the “official” story of events. Therefore, when skeptics attempt to ridicule a conspiracy theory by using the official story as a means of proving the conspiracy wrong, in effect, they are just reinforcing the original “mainstream” view of history, and actually not being skeptical as claimed.  Thus it is the case that we have believers claiming to be skeptics, apostles claiming to be heretics, disciples claiming to be heathens, and orthodoxists claiming to be iconoclasts, culminating into a bizarre achievement of Orwellian doublethink. </p>

<p>I too am guilty of having engaged in scornful pseudo-skepticism in the past. In fact I only came by the way of conspiratorial interest through membership of refined associations such as the tactfully named “conspiritards”. A true bastion of intellectual integrity, this company gleefully seeks out targets to sneer at with a vestige of casual bullying. I partook in these virulent campaigns both because I was bored and wanted to pass the time, and because there’s this strange sort fraternity being amongst people making fun of other people. Put another way, participating in classic tribal group mentality makes one feel like they’re a part of the “cool kids”, to use a high school-vernacular. </p>

<p>Yet, I couldn&#39;t help but notice that some conspiracy theorists were making interesting points. Frequently I would learn something intriguing that I hadn&#39;t known before, like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavon_Affair">Lavon Affair</a>. I had never heard of that. If it was true that one of our own “allies” had actually tried to kill our own people in order to manipulate events to their benefit, what else would they do? And the fact that the very agents tasked with carrying out this plot were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavon_Affair#Legacy">awarded certificates as recently as 2005</a> instead of being admonished? Offensively inconceivable. And in spite of this they are supposed to be one of our staunchest allies? After all, this is a government we regularly give billions of our taxpayer dollars to. These kinds of discoveries would begin leading me to more regularly investigate shady events of the past and present that have shaped the world we inhabit today, and which will continue to shape the world of tomorrow. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>The Grand Linchpin Theory</strong></p>

<p>Lately there has been a lot of discussion concerning police militarization, stock markets, Ukraine, Russia, China, Syria and Iran, ISIL, and the legitimacy of the Foley and Sotloff videos. Between professional analysts <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/bill-gardner/11054488/Foley-murder-video-may-have-been-staged.html">concluding that the beheading videos were staged</a>, a weird development on MH17 where NATO countries are either simply backpedaling on the issue or <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-causes-of-the-mh17-crash-are-classified-ukraine-netherlands-australia-belgium-signed-a-non-disclosure-agreement/5397194">signing non-disclosure agreements over the incident altogether</a>, or billionaires stating ominous things like <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/zell-soros-icahn-druckenmiller-preparing-for-plunge-2014-9">“I don&#39;t remember any time in my career where there have been as many wildcards floating out there that have the potential to be very significant and alter people&#39;s thinking&quot; and, &quot;If there&#39;s a change in confidence or some international event that changes the dynamics, people could in effect take a different position with reference to the market”</a>, it only makes sense to begin examining things with a critical eye. On the one hand we have ever-escalating tensions mounting on Ukraine’s border, and on the other hand we have the war hawks screeching for military intervention in the Middle East here at home. As I write this there are reports of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29098808">shelling in Ukraine marking a blow to the temporary cease-fire</a>, and a <a href="http://news.antiwar.com/2014/09/05/iran-offers-us-aid-in-fighting-isis-us-rejects-it/">refusal of the U.S.  to work alongside Iran</a> against ISIL despite them attempting to reach out to our government.  It doesn&#39;t take a particularly adept sleuth to sense something strange in the air.</p>

<p>I’m skeptical of one detail in particular. That of the scaling intermittent warnings by U.S. officials that “suspect something could happen on U.S. soil”, but claim that they can’t give more details on the matter, or that it’s all they know at the moment. Interestingly enough this is exactly what they claimed after 9/11, that they knew something was afoot but not that they had known any particular aspects, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1GCeuSr3Mk#t=1832">despite having been given very specific details of the attack by numerous foreign intelligence agencies</a>. I’m not interested in dwelling on 9/11 in this particular discussion however. <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/">There are</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1GCeuSr3Mk">numerous sources</a> out there which give a more comprehensive overview of the subject than I could possibly hope to do here. Suffice to say that there are relevant details between the tragic events of that day and what is most likely going to happen in the near future.</p>

<p>It is along these lines that I propose an appalling series of events which I have reason to believe will happen in the coming days. The theory that I propose will span across a timeline ranging from the immediate near future to possibly decades from now. I fully expect that some of you will assume a knee-jerk contrarian attitude towards this idea as it’s heterodox on multiple levels. I don’t fault you for that. However, I would kindly ask that you at least hear out what I have to say and then come to your own conclusions based on the credibility of my arguments. </p>

<p>*Addendum at the end of the posts.  </p>

<p><strong>The False Flag</strong></p>

<p>The first steps of the Grand Linchpin Theory (which for convenience’s sake I shall henceforth refer to as GLT) will look almost like a near repeat of the invasion of Iraq. It will include a false flag attack which will be used as a pretext for an invasion of Syria. Like our soft-spoken officials I cannot be certain of the exact logistics of the attack, but if I were a betting man I would place it happening on the anniversary of 9/11*. As it stands, the public is angry and disgusted by ISIL, yet not enough to the point where people are willing to accept boots on the ground. We are war-weary after two primary wars which have lasted over a decade and anything more than guided airstrikes assisting allied forces is greeted with uncertainty. The public has become jaded over the early years of the 21st century after fabrications of WMD’s, a gridlocked congress, rising inequality, police brutality, rampant corruption, and to top it all off, a seemingly omniscient domestic dragnet surveillance program. </p>

<p>Suddenly though we find ourselves in a scenario where we have an unparalleled bipartisan agreement over the barbarity of ISIL and, should an attack be blamed on them, I guarantee you that the government would have the full backing of the people to use full-scale military intervention in the Middle East once more. To have this attack happen on the exact date of 9/11 would not only be horrible in its own right, but it was also serve to open up old wounds from 13 years ago that people are still very much sensitive about. It would serve to create the ultimate atmosphere of furious indignation which would be all that the government needs to intervene.  Of course this doesn&#39;t necessarily have to happen exactly on that date; it could happen within a few months or thereabouts and still have the same effect as intended. For those hesitant over the idea that elements of our government would be willing to undertake such a deprived act I would like to point you towards <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods">Operation Northwoods</a>.  I would place special emphasis on the fact that the Joint Chiefs of Staff all signed off on this proposal and sent it to the president. The only thing that stopped this from originally being adopted was JFK, and when he died the following year, theoretically, nothing stood in the way of its implementation. </p>

<p><strong>Syrian Intervention</strong></p>

<p>Step two of GLT would be the conflict with ISIL inevitably resulting in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_creep">mission creep</a> which would see us to then seek the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad. The PTB (powers that be, i.e., top-level officials of our government) have undoubtedly wanted him gone for at least over a year now. You might recall how back in the August of last year the government claimed that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nearly-1500-killed-in-syrian-chemical-weapons-attack-us-says/2013/08/30/b2864662-1196-11e3-85b6-d27422650fd5_story.html">al-Assad had perpetuated a chemical attack on rebels</a> and had attempted to use that as a justification to topple his regime. For weeks there were deliberations on whether or not we should get involved, with certain key advisors urging Obama to do so in one ear and certain congressional members and the public saying no in the other.  As it happened, the latter group won out. Now to be clear, I’m neither denying nor affirming whether al-Assad did indeed use chemical weapons or not and, to be blunt, it doesn’t matter. I’m not saying it doesn’t matter in the humanitarian sense (that would certainly be an awful crime should it be true), but rather it doesn&#39;t matter in the realpolitik sense which is what is relevant in this scenario. The United States government doesn&#39;t embroil itself in geopolitical conflicts out of the goodness of their hearts; they do it because they have strategic interests in them.  </p>

<p>I probably don’t have to remind the reader at this point that we used 9/11 as an excuse to eliminate Saddam Hussein, who, as it turns out, had absolutely nothing to with that event. He didn’t want to play hardball with us when it came to oil and for that he had to go. To <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2004/11/9/confessions_of_an_economic_hit_man">quote John Perkins</a>, author of <em>Confessions of an Economic Hitman</em>:“…And the House of Saud would agree to maintain the price of oil within acceptable limits to us, which they’ve done all of these years, and we would agree to keep the House of Saud in power as long as they did this, which we’ve done, which is one of the reasons we went to war with Iraq in the first place. And in Iraq we tried to implement the same policy that was so successful in Saudi Arabia, but Saddam Hussein didn’t buy. When the economic hit men fail in this scenario, the next step is what we call the jackals. Jackals are C.I.A.-sanctioned people that come in and try to foment a coup or revolution. If that doesn’t work, they perform assassinations, or try to. In the case of Iraq, they weren’t able to get through to Saddam Hussein. He had — His bodyguards were too good. He had doubles. They couldn’t get through to him. So the third line of defense, if the economic hit men and the jackals fail, the next line of defense is our young men and women, who are sent in to die and kill, which is what we&#39;ve obviously done in Iraq.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although I do not doubt that oil plays a key role in the desire to eliminate Assad, I also believe there are other more relevant factors at play which influences the decision making of the PTB, such as Syrian alignment with Iran and Russia. It’s no secret that Russia greatly disapproves of the United States&#39; efforts to meddle with their ally and has done nothing but lambaste Obama for attempting to do so. Yet we continue to prod the bear in both Syria and Ukraine. How else though should Russia act, in the case of Ukraine, when <a href="http://www.investwithalex.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/nato-expansion.jpg">faced with an increasingly eastward expansion of the largest alliance on Earth</a> marching towards their borders? Could you imagine China forming a coalition with someone like Mexico? It would absolutely not be tolerated; as well it shouldn’t be from the United States’ perspective. No, either the U.S. is exceedingly naïve when it comes to diplomatic relations with foreign countries or they’re provoking something. All the while Putin is being painted as the mentally unstable aggressor seeking the glory days of old Soviet Russia.</p>

<p><strong>WWIII</strong></p>

<p>Step three of GLT is WWIII. Initially it might rather seem like a large jump to say military conflict in Syria would necessarily lead to the third world war. Intuitively, it might appear on its face to be nonsense. However it at this point that I must point towards the network of alliances currently in place with both the United States and Russia, a network of alliances not unlike World War 1.  In addition, it is important to examine the conditions which preluded WWII such as the economic status of the Weimar Republic.   </p>

<p>First let us take a look at Russia’s current and potential allies. Aside from Syria, Russia holds great ties with Iran and China and belongs to the formal organization of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States">CIS</a>. A part of the CIS is the member states of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Russia itself. Turkmenistan and Ukraine are also members, though obviously Ukraine would follow suit with the Western-back alliance as it stands now.  Not an alliance with a whole lot of tooth when compared to the Goliath that is NATO, but it could certainly hold its own in many instances. </p>

<p>The primary partners on Russia’s side in a potential war between East and West though would be <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ukraine-crisis-who-are-russias-biggest-allies-1439028">Syria, Iran, and possibly China</a>. China is somewhat of a wild card when it comes to direct military assistance in the form of providing soldiers to such a conflict, <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ukraine-crisis-china-back-russia-cold-war-over-crimea-1438650">but there is little doubt that they would diplomatically and economically side with Russia</a> in light of what would appear to be Western aggression. <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-06-01/are-china-and-russia-moving-toward-formal-alliance">There also always remains the possibility</a> that they could seek out a more formal military alliance with Russia in the future. In any case, the point is that a conflict developing between the United States and the Assad regime could easy create a domino effect in which Iran and Russia accepts a call of arms into the war against America and her allies. This kind of sprawling system of alliances is exactly what dragged Europe into WWI. </p>

<p>And of course on the United States’ side is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a>. With members spanning from North America to Eastern Europe to Eurasia it is quite the impressive alliance. It has countries as big as the U.S. and countries as small Luxembourg. It spans halfway across the world and should one of these countries go to war with a state such as Russia, the rest would be dragged along with them, creating a battlefield that would affect millions, even billions, of people. Of course, there would be severe economic consequences as well which is inevitable in a globalized and interconnected world which suddenly sees itself turned upside down. This isn’t to mention what China could do as an <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2263-internationalists-are-pushing-the-world-towards-globally-engineered-economic-warfare">ultimate trump card</a>. But I’ll get back to that later.</p>

<p>The last detail one must consider in a potential third world war scenario is the parallel between Russia’s economy following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Weimar Republic’s economy following the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>.  One of the provisions of this very punishing treaty was the controversial requirement of Germany to “accept the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage” during the war”, known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_231_of_the_Treaty_of_Versailles">War Guilt clause</a>. “The treaty forced Germany to disarm, make substantial territorial concessions, and pay reparations to certain countries that had formed the Entente powers. In 1921 the total cost of these reparations were assessed at 132 billion Marks which is equivalent to $442 billion dollars today. At the time economists, notably John Meynard Keynes predicted that the treaty was too harsh – a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles#Historical_assessments">‘Carthaginian peace’</a>, and said the figure was excessive and counter-productive. As historians attentively note, these conditions paved the way for resurgence in German nationalism and the rise of Hitler.  Finally, let’s examine the demise of Russia’s economy following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“In 1992 the United States government passed the Freedom Support Act, its aim to help Russia reconstruct itself. Along with millions of dollars of aid came a group of young advisers, economists, and political theorists who had a radical vision of what was necessary. They called it shock therapy. The aim was to remove all state control over the Russian economy at a stroke. All price subsidies would be removed, and all state industries privatized overnight.  The Americans allied themselves with a group of young radical free-marketeers around Yeltsin.   And together they drew up a plan. Underlying it was a theory of how to transform society, by creating new human beings. It was the same theory that laid behind the rise of what was called market democracy in Britain and America in the 1980’s. The theory said that if one destroyed all of the elite institutions that in the past told people what to do, and instead allowed individuals to become independent in the market place, then they would become new kinds of rational beings, choosing what they wanted. Out of this would come a new form of order and new kind of democracy in which the market and not politics gave people what they wanted. But things didn’t work out as the theory predicted.</p>

<p>On the first day of the plan all price controls in Russia were removed, and the cost of all goods soared.  The only solution for millions of Russians was to come out onto the streets and sell their belongings for anything they could get. The chaos spread as the currency no longer had any value. Then the privatization plan kicked in. Every Russian was given vouchers to buy shares in the privatized companies. But desperate for cash, they simply sold their vouchers to ruthless businessman for a fraction of their worth. And a new elite began to emerge who snuffed up vast sections of Russian industry.  They became known as the Oligarchs. Faced with this the deputies in parliament began to protest against what they called economic genocide, which led to chaos and violence in parliament. In face of this, the group of reformers around Yeltsin convinced him he had to suspend parliament. In protest, the deputies occupied parliament. Yeltsin’s response was brutal. He ordered the army to attack. The deputies were arrested and Yeltsin announced that he would now rule by decree. Shock therapy continued, but in the future people were going to be made free through force and dictatorship. But what actually happened was that Yeltsin became the creature of those with the real power in the new Russia- the Oligarchs. And then in 1998 the experiment came dramatically to an end. Out of this economic catastrophe a new order emerged, but it wasn’t the spontaneous order dreamt up by the free market utopians. It was the very opposite- a harsh and tough nationalism imposed by the new president, Vladimir Putin. Putin arrested or exiled the major Oligarchs and set about dismantling many of the democratic freedoms in the new Russia. But this was welcomed by the majority of Russians who wanted order, not freedom.”</p>

<p>This order and sense of collective nationalistic identity is exactly what Hitler provided the destitute and frustrated Germans back in the 1930’s. Under extreme duress people naturally turn towards authoritarianism as a means of achieving stability and pride which otherwise could not be obtained through a narrow sense of freedom. Now to be clear, I’m not saying that Putin is thoroughly identical to Hitler, although he is certainly no saint himself. He clearly persecutes homosexuals and perverts the democratic process that is supposed to be in place, but he’s also not committing genocide on unprecedented scales either. I suppose one could say that he is “Hitler-lite”, or a classic authoritarian ruler. </p>

<p>Between the sprawling network of alliances and nationalism rampant throughout not only Russia but also the United States it seems reasonable to suspect that conflict among East and West is plausible. It is for these reasons that I suggest an impending third world war isn’t too far off from now.  What the war will look like and how it will play is anybody’s guess, but it’s guaranteed to be as deadly if not more so than WWII ever was.  </p>

<p><strong>The Collapse of the International Monetary System</strong> </p>

<p>That’s all well and good you might think to yourself but where does all of this leave us, exactly? What’s the purpose of all of this? If there truly are people engineering such a series of events, what are they trying to achieve? Who are these people? What is their endgame?  Before I begin to explore each of these questions we need to first understand the precarious position of the dollar and its status as a global reserve currency. </p>

<p>Beginning at the dawn of the economic crisis of 2007/2008 it was easy to make the assumption that people were going to realize that they were suffering a normalcy bias. <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2041-deluded-currency-cultists-believe-the-dollar-is-invincible">To quote Brandon Smith</a>: “In 2006, the amount of ego on display surrounding mortgage investment was so disturbingly grotesque anyone with any true understanding of the situation felt like projectile vomiting. To watch the smug righteousness of MSNBC and FOX economic pundits as they predicted the infinite rise of American property markets despite all evidence to the contrary was truly mind blowing. When the whole system imploded, it was difficult to know whether one should laugh, or cry. The saddest aspect of the credit crisis of 2008 was not the massive chain reaction of bankruptcies or the threat of institutional insolvency. Rather, it was the delusional assumptions of the public that the grand mortgage casino was going to go on forever. There is nothing worse than witnessing the victim of a Ponzi scheme defend the lie which has ultimately destroyed him.” </p>

<p>Brandon goes on to say that “The cultism surrounding the U.S. economy and the U.S. dollar is truly mind boggling, and by “cultism” I mean a blind faith in the fiat currency mechanism that goes beyond all logic, reason and evidence. In recent weeks it has become more visible as global financiers play both sides of the Ukrainian conflict, luring Americans into a frenzy of false patriotism and an anti-Russo-sports-team-mentality. My personal distaste for Vladimir Putin revolves around my understanding that he is just as much a puppet of the International Monetary Fund and international banks as Barack Obama, but many Americans hate him simply because the mainstream media has designated him the next villain in the fantasy tale of U.S. foreign policy. Open threats from Russia that they will dump U.S. treasury bond holdings and the dollar’s world reserve status if NATO interferes in the Ukraine have been met with wildly naive chest beating from dollar cultists.  I am beginning to see the talking points everywhere. ‘Let them dump the dollar, Russia’s holdings are minimal!’ Or, ‘Let them throw out Treasuries, they’ll just be shooting themselves in the foot!’ are the battle cries heard across the web. I wish I could convey how insane this viewpoint is, especially in light of the fact that many alternative economic analysts, including myself, have been predicting just such a scenario for years.”</p>

<p>He then lists off a series of reasons why there’s a strong possibility that the demise of the dollar will happen in the near term. To save time and space I will give a brief summary of what some of these reasons are:</p>

<p>1) China alongside Russia will “decouple” from the dollar system. “China, our largest foreign creditor, and India (a supposed ally) have clearly sided with Russia on the Ukrainian issue.” </p>

<p>2)  China has already been slowly dumping the dollar as a world reserve currency using bilateral trade agreements with numerous countries, including Russia, India, Australia, Brazil, Germany, Japan, etc.</p>

<p>3)  A total drop of the dollar or U.S. treasury bonds by Russia and China would send shock waves through global markets. Russia is a major energy supplier for most of Europe. China is the largest export/import nation in the world. If they refuse to accept dollars as a trade mechanism, numerous countries will fall in line to abandon the greenback as well.</p>

<p>4) China has been shifting away from export dependency since at least 2008, calling for a larger consumer based market at home. This process of enriching the Chinese consumer has almost been completed.</p>

<p>5) China (and most of the world) has ended new dollar purchases for their FOREX reserves.</p>

<p>6) China executed the <a href="http://http/money.cnn.com/2014/02/19/investing/china-treasuries/">second largest dump</a> of U.S. Treasury bonds in history in the past month.</p>

<p>7) Russia, China, and numerous other countries, including U.S. “allies”, have been calling for the end of the dollar’s world reserve status and the institution of a <a href="http://http/www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/at-g20-kremlin-to-pitch-new-currency/375364.html">new global basket currency</a> using the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights (SDR). Even Putin has suggested that the IMF take over administration of the global economy and issue the SDR as a world currency system. This flies in the face of those who argue that the IMF is somehow “American run”. The truth is, the IMF is run by global banks and no more answers to the U.S. government than the Federal Reserve answers to the U.S. government.</p>

<p>Brandon gives several other convincing arguments for the case of the dollar’s demise which you can read for yourself, but the idea is the same. We have come to be misled down a path of absolute blind faith which is lighted by the way of the financial priests’ honeyed words. A faith which is absolutely unwarranted and misplaced. A faith which will have serious repercussions not just for ourselves but also for the world.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But there’s no need to take Mr. Smith’s word alone on the matter. Look at what James Rickards, author of Currency Wars, port-folio manager at West Shore Group, adviser on international economics and financial threats to the DoD and the U.S. intelligence community, and facilitator of the first-ever financial war games conducted by the Pentagon has to say in chapter 2 of his book <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Death_of_Money.html?id=uUNKAAAAQBAJ">The Death of Money</a>: “On this occasion, Marshall was not being briefed on kinetic weapons or air-sea tactics. He was hearing about sovereign wealth funds, stealth gold acquisition, and potential threats to national security caused by U.S. Federal Reserve policy. China has over $3 trillion of investments denominated in U.S. dollars, and every 10 percent devaluation in the dollar engineered by the Fed represents a $300 billion real wealth transfer from China to the United States. It is not clear how long China will tolerate this raid on its accumulated wealth. If China were not able to defeat the United States in the air or on the sea, it could attack through capital markets…The Chinese were less affected than other Asian nations by the panic, but they studied the situation and began to see how banks, working in conjunction with the IMF, could undermine civil society and possibly force regime change.” </p>

<p>Rickards later mentions that “The financial meltdown in 2008 was not an act of financial warfare, but it did demonstrate to U.S. officials the complexity and vulnerability of the global financial system. Approximately $60 trillion of wealth was destroyed from the peak in October 2007 to the trough in March 2009. If such a catastrophe could be caused by instruments as innocuous at mortgages, imagine how much more harm could be caused by malicious market manipulation orchestrated by experts who knew exactly how the system behaved. The coming collapse of the dollar and the international monetary system is entirely foreseeable… Only nations and individuals who make provision today will survive the maelstrom to come.” </p>

<p><strong>New World Order</strong></p>

<p>Ah yes, the grandest conspiracy of them all. A new world order.  The last piece of the puzzle. For years now people have debated whether there has been a concerted effort towards a new system of world governance and if so who would be behind it. Ideas that have been suggested range everywhere from the fanciful lizard folks of star Alpha Draconis in the Draco constellation to certain secret societies such as the Illuminati or Freemasons. Exact details vary depending on who you speak to but the gist if largely the same: A single world government which is truly only ruled by a small group of powerful people. This idea is, on the surface, quite undoubtedly a ludicrous proposal. It sounds like something out of a Dan Brown novel. We live in a world inhabited by over 7 billion people divided into distinct ethnic and cultural groups who, logistically, could never be ruled over by a single privileged elite without perpetual unrest. It just isn’t possible. Or so it might seem. </p>

<p>To understand this notion of a new world order (or NWO as referred to by certain people), you need to be aware of the relationship between the IMF, World Bank, and the national banks. You see, we are more globalized and interconnected than ever before in human history, even more so than the 19th century and years leading up to WWI. A lot of people who were alive during that time believed that the interdependence of nations on one another for the health of their economies would prevent wars from happening on the scales that they had been conducted in the past. There might have been something to those arguments had there been a single unified currency.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/1308-the-linchpin-lie-how-global-collapse-will-be-sold-to-the-masses">In another of Brandon Smith’s articles</a> he refers to what is called Linchpin theory (from whom I have borrowed the namesake of my more overarching theory and who he himself borrowed from John Casti, a systems theorist, Futurist, and former employee of the globalist think tank Rand Corporation).  Described within Casti’s book <em>X-Events: The Collapse of Everything</em>, this theory lays out how scapegoats will be utilized for global catastrophes that will ultimately be designed by the establishment. “Linchpin Theory argues that overt social, political, and technological ‘complexity’ is to blame for the most destructive events in modern human history, and it is indeed an enticing suggestion for those who are uneducated and unaware of the behind the scenes mechanics of world events.  Casti would like you to believe that political and social tides are unguided and chaotic; that all is random, and disaster is a product of ‘chance’ trigger events that occur at the height of a malfunctioning and over-complicated system. What he fails to mention and what he should well know being a member of Rand, is that global events do not evolve in a vacuum.  There have always been those groups who see themselves as the ‘select’, and who aspire to mold the future to their personal vision of Utopia.  It has been openly admitted in myriad official observations on historical events that such groups have had a direct hand in the advent of particular conflicts. </p>

<p>In the economic arena, one might say that the collapse of Lehman Bros. was the “linchpin” that triggered the landslide in the derivatives market which is still going on to this day.  However, the derivatives market bubble was a carefully constructed house of cards, deliberately created with the help of multiple agencies and institutions.  The private Federal Reserve had to artificially lower interest rates and inject trillions upon trillions into the housing market, the international banks had to invest those trillions into mortgages that they KNEW were toxic and likely never to be repaid.  The Federal Government had to allow those mortgages to then be chopped up into derivatives and resold on the open market.  The ratings agencies had to examine those derivatives and obviously defunct mortgages and then stamp them AAA.  The SEC had to ignore the massive fraud being done in broad daylight while sweeping thousands of formal complaints and whistle blowers under the rug. </p>

<p>This was not some ‘random’ event caused by uncontrolled ‘complexity’.  This was engineered complexity with a devious purpose.  The creation of the derivatives collapse was done with foreknowledge, at least by some.  Goldman Sachs was caught red handed betting against their OWN derivatives instruments!  Meaning they knew exactly what was about to happen in the market they helped build!  This is called Conspiracy…</p>

<p>One might attribute Casti’s idea to a sincere belief in chaos, and a lack of insight into the nature of globalism as a brand of religion.  However, in his first and as far as I can tell only interview with Coast To Coast Radio, Casti promotes catastrophic &#39;X-Events&#39; as a &#39;good thing&#39; for humanity, right in line with the Rand Corporation ideology.  Casti, being a futurist and elitist, sees the ideas of the past as obsolete when confronted with the technological advancements of the modern world, and so, describes X-event moments as a kind of evolutionary &#39;kickstart&#39;, knocking us out of our old and barbaric philosophies of living and forcing us, through trial by fire, to adapt to a more streamlined culture.  The linchpin event is, to summarize Casti’s position, a culture’s way of ‘punishing itself’ for settling too comfortably into its own heritage and traditions.  In other words, WE will supposedly be to blame for the next great apocalypse, not the elites…”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need to accept the truth that there are powerful people out there who sit behind the scenes and pull the strings of nations around the world in order to exploit events towards a desired goal. We need to rid the notion that such people belong to nothing more than Saturday morning cartoons, video games, movies, and dystopian fiction. Some of these people may genuinely believe that their twisted sense of ideology is the correct choice for humanity, but others do this for no reason other than greed. </p>

<p>To further borrow from Mr. Smith: “With almost every major economy on the globe on the verge of collapse and most now desperately inflating, taxing, or outright stealing in order to hide their situation, with multiple tinderbox environments being facilitated in the Pacific with China, North Korea, and Japan, and in the Middle East and Africa with Egypt, Syria, Iran, Pakistan, Yemen, Mali, etc., there is no doubt that we are living in a linchpin-rich era.  It is inevitable that one or more of these explosive tension points will erupt and cause a chain reaction around the planet.  The linchpin and the chain reaction will become the focus of our epoch, rather than the men who made them possible in the first place. </p>

<p>Now, I think anyone with any sense can see where this is going.  Casti and Rand Corporation are giving us a glimpse into the future of propaganda.  This is what will be written in our children’s history books if the globalists have their way. The fact that Linchpin Theory is featured in a primetime television show at all is a testament to Rand Corporation’s influence in the media.  But, as for the wider picture, are the trigger points around us really just a product of complex coincidence?  </p>

<p>Not a chance.  </p>

<p>Each major global hot-spot today can easily be linked back to the designs of international corporate and banking interests and the puppet governments they use as messengers.  Casti claims that “X-events” and “linchpins” cannot be accurately predicted, but it would seem that they can certainly be purposely instigated.  </p>

<p>The globalists have stretched the whole of the world thin.  They have removed almost every pillar of support from the edifice around us, and like a giant game of Jenga, are waiting for the final piece to be removed, causing the teetering structure to crumble.  Once this calamity occurs, they will call it a random act of fate, or a mathematical inevitability of an overly complex system.  They will say that they are not to blame.  That we were in the midst of “recovery”.  That they could not have seen it coming. </p>

<p>Their solution will be predictable.  They will state that in order to avoid such future destruction, the global framework must be ‘simplified’, and what better way to simplify the world than to end national sovereignty, dissolve all borders, and centralize nation states under a single economic and political ideal?”</p>

<p><strong>Fin</strong></p>

<p>&quot;The nature of the universe is such that the ends can never justify the means. On the contrary, the means always determine the end.&quot;
-Aldous Huxley</p>

<p>These cunning and idealistic utopians are engaging in a dangerous experiment of godhood.  They seek to create an order built upon the foundations of ruination and chaos, an order that they will “coincidentally” just so happen be on top of. The casualties of order are seen as nothing more by them than necessary losses in the strive for a different humanity. They will not be mourned by the architects and engineers of this brave new world. </p>

<p>There was once an aspiration of true freedom for every man and woman to pursue their own happiness. A true freedom which has been corrupted into a new, more slavish idea of liberty. This distortion has led us to believe that servitude is emancipation. That war is peace. That ignorance is strength. Fear, this parent of cruelty, has infiltrated the Psychosphere of Western Civilization and ensnared our collective consciousness. We have forsaken freedom in exchange for false promises of safety. We have handed the keys over to the devil and wonder why everything has gone to hell. </p>

<p>This doesn’t have to be inevitable, however. Every strategy has its flaws and can be countered in equal proportion should the proper forces be mobilized. Knowledge is the ultimate weapon, but it’s a double-edged one. By enforcing a state of ignorance, the elite have ensured an oligopoly on true power.  The last thing any ruler wants is for his subjects to be as intelligent as himself, for he knows that when armed with a comparable wisdom they pose a threat to the established order of things. </p>

<p>In our lifetime we will see chaos unmatched by even the 20th century. We will see more war, death, destruction and instability than we have up until now. We might not be able to achieve a better world in our lifetime, but we can strive towards one. For those of you who want to have children at some point in your life, it is your duty as a human being to ensure them a world that is better than the one you inherited. We are not simple animals. We are complex beings who have the capability to create a world worth living in. </p>

As you are no doubt aware, that day thankfully came and went without any sort of horrific event as I had originally supposed it might. This is one of those rare instances where it&#39;s better to have been wrong rather than to have been right. Although despite this, I fear that some readers may get hung up on this one point specifically and use it as a justification to ignore the more important parts of my theory. </p>

<p>If I had to do this part over again I might have been more cautious in explicitly asserting any one day in favor over others, as <em>when</em> it might happen is less important than the fact that it <em>will</em> likely happen. Original readers might remember than in the very next paragraph I go on to state that, &quot;of course this doesn&#39;t necessarily have to happen exactly on that date; it could happen within a few months or thereabouts and still have the same effect as intended&quot;. I realize that this will come off as a cop-out to some and I don&#39;t necessarily blame you for feeling that way, but do please try to keep the broader picture in mind. In any case, the false-flag argument in particular is overall less significant than the Syrian intervention which is what will truly be the catalyst for the looming international storm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post, I do agree with the general gist. However, I think something far more insidious than the idea of groups of rich elites sitting around discussing how to gain even more power is the idea of institutions in the capitalist system, either corporate or public institutions (like the IMF), now performing as far greater than the sum of its parts, and those in charge of, say, the EU, the IMF, or even CEOs of corporate banks, all operate under certain assumptions and beliefs, coloured by their privileged backgrounds and the institutions they find themselves in, and are completely convinced by their actions...and even if they weren&#39;t, fairly powerless to stop the juggernauts that global institutions have become. It isn&#39;t a problem of individuals, it is a systemic problem.</p>

<p>What you have overlooked or deliberately chosen to omit is the role of environmental destruction (climate change, but also just the side effects of industrial economies), media saturation, the identity creation of corporations (the individual as the consumer, buying goods as form of identification), and the death of spirituality and rise of materialism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely correct. This is indeed part an all-encompassing systemic problem, one that I perhaps could have been more attentive towards. These institutions such as the media, corporations, banks, international organizations, etc., have entrenched themselves in the global order of things and serve to contribute to the existence of a near-impenetrable hegemony on power, utilized and shared only by a privileged elite.</p>

<p>For the sake of a more detailed and specific proposition I did have to omit certain topics such as what you have mentioned.

    <div class="md"><p>We need to accept the truth that there are powerful people out there who sit behind the scenes and pull the strings of nations around the world in order to exploit events towards a desired goal. We need to rid the notion that such people belong to nothing more than Saturday morning cartoons, video games, movies, and dystopian fiction. Some of these people may genuinely believe that their twisted sense of ideology is the correct choice for humanity, but others do this for no reason other than greed. </p>

<p>To further borrow from Mr. Smith: “With almost every major economy on the globe on the verge of collapse and most now desperately inflating, taxing, or outright stealing in order to hide their situation, with multiple tinderbox environments being facilitated in the Pacific with China, North Korea, and Japan, and in the Middle East and Africa with Egypt, Syria, Iran, Pakistan, Yemen, Mali, etc., there is no doubt that we are living in a linchpin-rich era.  It is inevitable that one or more of these explosive tension points will erupt and cause a chain reaction around the planet.  The linchpin and the chain reaction will become the focus of our epoch, rather than the men who made them possible in the first place. </p>

<p>Now, I think anyone with any sense can see where this is going.  Casti and Rand Corporation are giving us a glimpse into the future of propaganda.  This is what will be written in our children’s history books if the globalists have their way. The fact that Linchpin Theory is featured in a primetime television show at all is a testament to Rand Corporation’s influence in the media.  But, as for the wider picture, are the trigger points around us really just a product of complex coincidence?  </p>

<p>Not a chance.  </p>

<p>Each major global hot-spot today can easily be linked back to the designs of international corporate and banking interests and the puppet governments they use as messengers.  Casti claims that “X-events” and “linchpins” cannot be accurately predicted, but it would seem that they can certainly be purposely instigated.  </p>

<p>The globalists have stretched the whole of the world thin.  They have removed almost every pillar of support from the edifice around us, and like a giant game of Jenga, are waiting for the final piece to be removed, causing the teetering structure to crumble.  Once this calamity occurs, they will call it a random act of fate, or a mathematical inevitability of an overly complex system.  They will say that they are not to blame.  That we were in the midst of “recovery”.  That they could not have seen it coming. </p>

<p>Their solution will be predictable.  They will state that in order to avoid such future destruction, the global framework must be ‘simplified’, and what better way to simplify the world than to end national sovereignty, dissolve all borders, and centralize nation states under a single economic and political ideal?”</p>

<p><strong>Fin</strong></p>

<p>&quot;The nature of the universe is such that the ends can never justify the means. On the contrary, the means always determine the end.&quot;
-Aldous Huxley</p>

<p>These cunning and idealistic utopians are engaging in a dangerous experiment of godhood.  They seek to create an order built upon the foundations of ruination and chaos, an order that they will “coincidentally” just so happen be on top of. The casualties of order are seen as nothing more by them than necessary losses in the strive for a different humanity. They will not be mourned by the architects and engineers of this brave new world. </p>

<p>There was once an aspiration of true freedom for every man and woman to pursue their own happiness. A true freedom which has been corrupted into a new, more slavish idea of liberty. This distortion has led us to believe that servitude is emancipation. That war is peace. That ignorance is strength. Fear, this parent of cruelty, has infiltrated the Psychosphere of Western Civilization and ensnared our collective consciousness. We have forsaken freedom in exchange for false promises of safety. We have handed the keys over to the devil and wonder why everything has gone to hell. </p>

<p>This doesn’t have to be inevitable, however. Every strategy has its flaws and can be countered in equal proportion should the proper forces be mobilized. Knowledge is the ultimate weapon, but it’s a double-edged one. By enforcing a state of ignorance, the elite have ensured an oligopoly on true power.  The last thing any ruler wants is for his subjects to be as intelligent as himself, for he knows that when armed with a comparable wisdom they pose a threat to the established order of things. </p>

<p>In our lifetime we will see chaos unmatched by even the 20th century. We will see more war, death, destruction and instability than we have up until now. We might not be able to achieve a better world in our lifetime, but we can strive towards one. For those of you who want to have children at some point in your life, it is your duty as a human being to ensure them a world that is better than the one you inherited. We are not simple animals. We are complex beings who have the capability to create a world worth living in. </p>
