<p>The poison is even going into bottles of mineral water according to the chap they caught</p>

<p>&quot;A man in Schieffelin, a community located in Margibi County on the Robertsfield Highway, has been arrested for attempting to put formaldehyde into a well used by the community.</p>

<p>Reports say around 10 a.m., he approached the well with powder in a bottle. Mobbed by the community, he confessed that he had been paid to put formaldeyde into the well, and that he was not the only one. He reportedly told community dwellers, “We are many.” There are  are agents in Harbel, Dolostown, Cotton Tree and other communities around the ountry, he said.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;The man also alleged that some water companies, particularly those bagging mineral water to sell, are also involved. The poison, he said, produces Ebola-like symptoms and subsequently kills people.&quot;</p>

<p>Except it&#39;s not controlled nor is the WHO making an assumption that it&#39;s being controlled.</p>

<p>You linked to an unsourced and painful article. Please link me the scientific papers where formaldehyde produces Ebola-like symptoms. I&#39;ll wait. Only relevant search on Google: &quot;ebola+formaldehyde&quot; produces this reddit post and the article you linked. </p>

<p>Lastly, how would this make Ebola a false flag? Wouldn&#39;t this simply be a terrorist attack by a militant group (assuming your article isn&#39;t completely an absurd sham).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even going to go into why trusting an unsourced and poorly written article is a good idea. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody said that the WHO has make an assumption that this was being controlled, there would be no need for the WHO to be made aware of which areas were being poisoned or that is was deliberate.</p>

<p>The article is the source, it will be used by other articles as the source.  There&#39;s an original source to everything.</p>

<p>It would make Ebola a false-flag as this is a controlled poisoning rather than an outbreak of a disease.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So 5 days ago in Nzerekore a market was sprayed with &#39;disinfectant&#39;  (likely Formaldehyde), this caused a riot as &quot;some also reportedly feared the spray would spread Ebola&quot;.  How many of these people who were sprayed will go down with Formaldehyde poisoning and be diagnosed with Ebola?  This will then cause more &#39;disinfectant&#39; to be sprayed elsewhere, so we&#39;re seeing the DDT/Polio scam continued.</p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing how quickly you jump from conjecture to asserting that conjecture as fact.</p>

<p>This is the way to control an Ebola outbreak, <strong>you simply fake it</strong></p>

<p>He is not asserting that it&#39;s the government spreading the disease. He is stating there is NO DISEASE! That the formaldehyde is just causing symptoms of such and the government is faking a disease.</p>

<p>You infer that governments can and do spread disease. Which I concur. However this is not the case here.</p>
