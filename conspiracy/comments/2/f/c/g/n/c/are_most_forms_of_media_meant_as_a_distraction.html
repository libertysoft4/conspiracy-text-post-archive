        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After living in a househould which religiously watches the television and are non-users of psychs I&#39;ve come to a couple conclusions. First off, these people love their dogs too much. But more importantly, movies, television, and the news seem to be more of a distraction from life than a true help to education.</p>

<p>When I come home, something will be playing on the TV guaranteed. Ranges from Avatar to some fucking Disney movie their 20 year old child daughter is watching to Bill O&#39;Rielly.</p>

<p>When it&#39;s the daughter, everything is compared to everything. &quot;That movie&#39;s so bad&quot; and seems to watch movies simply for the acting never quite analyzing and getting lost in philosophy of say, Transcendence. Personal taste does play a role in this but I&#39;ve noticed this among people who use television as a means of time wasting. They wait for the next time waster never really thinking, just sort of watching.</p>

<p>In this same way, the news controls a person&#39;s perspective of life. Watching the aforementioned douche Bill O&#39;Reilly or The Kelly File all I see are circular arguments. &quot;Drugs are illegal. They&#39;re illegal because they&#39;re drugs&quot;. And that&#39;s fine and dandy, the general population agrees with that sentiment because they are told so through their miniscule education they receive. Here&#39;s the funny part though. In all news outlets, the blame is never on themselves and no apologies are ever given. &quot;The Democrats/Republicans/Liberals/Conservatives/Tea-Partiers/OTHER PEOPLE are the problem&quot;. It then turns into a shriek fest where the captured video doesn&#39;t involve discussion or even arguments but ear-drum breaking decibels. It doesn&#39;t quite matter what news you watch. If it has a party attached to it, they are never wrong.</p>

<p>As well, our dear Obama seems to get flack for being a &quot;bad president&quot; when it seems people don&#39;t understand he&#39;s just a blame figure. Before this, Bush was the popular scapegoat and guaranteed there will be another after. Either the person will be idolized or mocked no matter what they do.</p>

<p>Do people not really see this distraction or blame-game in waking life?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Its a pity, to see otherwise intelligent folks getting fooled into believing they are living. Being alive is not the same as living, imo. </p>

<p>While my wife and i do enjoy waching certain shows and movies, there are plenty of days/nights where we opt to keep the television off. Instead, i enjoy learning other languages (currently working on tagalog, and am teaching my wife how to speak german.) We take our dog out everyday. We go down to the river, or to the beach, or to the park, anywhere outside where we can immerse ourselves in nature. </p>

<p>When we do watch our shows/movies, we tend to discuss the abstract meanings of certain themes in the movies, even in disney movies like Maleficent. </p>

<p>In todays &quot;modern&quot; society, i truely believe people become so stressed, that they feel like they must drown themselves out into complacency just to make ends meet. They often forget to live life the way we were meant.</p>

<p>Psychedlics have a special place in this regard, imo. Not just to get &quot;high&quot;, like how the kids do it. No, but to immerse oneself into another realm free of the shackles of indoctrinated thought and logic. I believe they are fantastic therapeutic tools, if used with respect and honest, ingenuous intent. Not just to drown out the stressors of life.</p>

<p>Many folks wish to drown out the static. They do this with drugs, alcohol, even television shows and movies. Anything to get and to keep their mind off of the financial enslavement/endenturement they must endure the following days.</p>

<p>I can see it in the gaze of my coworkers. People are unhappy, generally, with this current societal paradigm of work work work, work some more, and then <em>maybe</em> get some playtime, if you can afford it. </p>

<p>But, to answer your original question (in the title), i do not believe most forms were mecessarily <strong>meant</strong> to be distractions. As TPTB are opportunivores, i do believe they have taken advantage of the druglike nature of various forms of media to disconnect oneself from reality, and from life in general. </p>

<p>Whether or not they were originally meant as distractions, they have certainly become some of the most widely used forms of distraction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Psychedelics allows us to achieve a higher perspective about all life forms.. Psilocybin mushrooms, if taken at a right dosage, will let you see that the earth is a beautiful living entity... but the powers that be doesn&#39;t want that. They want people to remain a sheep for their own dark agendas</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I look at it this way:</p>

<p>You said &quot;Drugs are illegal. They&#39;re illegal because they&#39;re drugs&quot;.. that notion exists just so people will be incarcerated/put to death penalty or other forms of punishment for &quot;breaking the law&quot;. If people look at it like &quot;That person&#39;s using drugs. That person shouldn&#39;t be punished for exploring his or her own consciousness.&quot; I can imagine that the world will be significantly better... and DEA or other forms of factions &#39;against&#39; drugs exist so there will be profit. Black market &gt;sells drugs to anti drug factions&gt;distribute them to dealers&gt;dealers distribute them to whoever wishes to acquire drugs&gt;once someone gets caught they confiscate the drugs&gt;anti drug faction sells it to the black market. I am not certain if people will get this but that&#39;s the way I think of it. That type of system existed back in my home country, as a friend of mine, which is the daughter of a high-ranking DEA officer told her that.</p>

<p>About &quot;The Democrats/Republicans/Liberals/Conservatives/Tea-Partiers/OTHER PEOPLE are the problem&quot;... they simply exist so that the general populace have an illusion of free choice... so instead of blaming the shadow government/illuminati/13 powerful families/private bankers etc, people will blame politicians.</p>

<p>Lastly, those programs we get shoved down our weary throats are nothing but mere distractions/coverups/trash to manipulate our perception about the world we know today.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just my opinion that I just wanted to share.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In fact, something like this seems to have happened 
already with one of our society’s most important
psychological tools for enabling people to reduce (or at
least temporarily escape from) stress, namely, mass entertainment
(see paragraph 147). Our use of mass entertainment 
is “optional”: No law requires us to watch television,
listen to the radio, read magazines. Yet mass entertainment 
is a means of escape and stress-reduction on
which most of us have become dependent. Everyone com
plains about the trashiness of television, but almost everyone 
watches it. A few have kicked the TV habit, but it
would be a rare person who could get along today without
using ANY form of mass entertainment. (Yet until quite recently 
in human history most people got along very nicely
with no other entertainment than that which each local
community created for itself.) Without the entertainment
industry the system probably would not have been able to
get away with putting as much stress producing pressure
on us as it does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a reason it&#39;s called television programming... You are being programmed on how to think, act, eat, dress, form opinions, and view the world. It&#39;s so well done that the people that are being brainwashed don&#39;t even realize it, it&#39;s like candy, because they wouldn&#39;t allow something like that be happening to people would they??? Just take a look at someone that watches any news station religiously. They do not form their own opinion, they just spout off what their told.</p>

<p>I love this stand up from Eddie Griffin giving a piece of advice that&#39;s very relevant to this topic: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEGidFKs5XU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEGidFKs5XU</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think so: you have to consider who <em>owns/control</em> media; what i believe has been part of the agenda, keep the populace passive AND ignorant.</p>

<p>most ppl don&#39;t filter what they see on tv or what they read, as most ppl don&#39;t <em>think</em> about the info they&#39;re being force fed.</p>

<p>imo <em>we</em> are on a timeline, the <em>truth</em> is being revealed, slowly, which is long overdue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the few times a headline that ends with a question mark is not immediately and obviously answered with a &#39;no&#39;.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason we describe a lot of movies/tv/books as &quot;entertainment&quot;. It&#39;s designed to amuse you. Some media is also designed to convey a particular message; as more people are involved in the creation of a work, the more likely it is to be one that&#39;s approved by the executives focused on nothing beyond making more money. It takes a small army to make these things, and if you don&#39;t have someone watching the bottom line you&#39;ll have trouble paying that army to make the next one, or even to finish the current one.</p>

<p>Also damnit this is one of those moments where I really, really miss the old &#39;former agent of the global media complex&#39; custom flair I had. Whatever happened to flair on this subreddit anyway.</p>
