    <div class="md"><p>If Britain&#39;s monarchy and parliament are capable of widespread pedophilia and coverups...why doesn&#39;t it stand to reason that American politicians are subject to the same denial and debauchery? But we know they are.</p>

<p>United States citizens, under law by the Federal Government, are considered <em>currency</em> in foreign nations. Does it not stand to reason that young celebrities might be used to make money from anonymous elite? It has been done throughout history, yet people deny that it could exist today? Where human slavery can occur in places like Africa, Italy, France, Brazil, Mexico, China, Britain, Russia, and even America? </p>

<p><strong>When our security in the United States is at an all-time low, how can we expect ANYBODY who is responsible for it (DOD, DHS, NSA, CIA, FBI) to protect us???</strong></p>

<p>Polaroid photos locked in a physical safe are more secure than electronically stored photos, as it requires a person physically enters your premises to gain entry to the safe ( breaking and entering ) and then breaks your safe open ( property damage ) and then takes your photos ( theft ).</p>

<p>This is why security exists, to TRY to prevent people from doing things they aren&#39;t supposed to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no reasonable expectation of security for transferring data electronically, do I really have to explain it to you?</p>

<p>Back in the day, to intercept telegrams, they would literally install a device onto the transmission line, which is why they call it wire tapping.</p>

<p>That was in like 1924.</p>

<p>Go ahead and try to fool yourself into thinking that people have made encryption methods that can evade the all seeing eye of the USGOV, they haven&#39;t. The DoD receives billions in funding, and have been researching online security since 84.</p>
