<p>People who saw stuff did come out. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once again we find that the argument of the peculiarly unskeptical skeptics is not just fallacious, but factually incorrect. There have, in fact, been numerous whistleblowers with documentable evidence of the frauds and lies that have been constructed around the official 9/11 narrative. This leads those who use the “But someone would have talked” argument in an uncomfortable situation. Either they are incompetent—boldly pronouncing on issues they have not bothered to investigate—or they are lying. The next time someone attempts to use this argument in your presence, it might be worthwhile to inquire which term applies to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if they want to know why someone directly involved would not come out... well for one, if you&#39;re involved in such a massive crime the odds are you are so broken and so far gone from humanity that it makes no logical sense for you to ever come out. There is also something called the division of labor. People in the military are involved every day with things they are not aware of. They get handed some documents and are asked to deliver it, or are sent on a mission with no explanation of what the purpose is.</p>

<p>Look at the old MKULTRA experiments. There were hospitals set up as CIA fronts that were doing experiments on people and the doctors involved had no idea they were part of a government program. They didn&#39;t need to know so they were not told. They could have not blown the whistle because they did not know enough to do so.</p>

<p>that&#39;s what they want you to believe.  for how many years was the manhattan project kept &quot;secret&quot; ?  (with 10&#39;s of thousands of contractors involved.)</p>

<p>if you are waiting for dick cheney to admit he enabled it ?  or if you are waiting for larry silverstein to admit he engaged in one of the most horrendous acts of &quot;insurance fraud&quot; in history... don&#39;t hold your breath ;)</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say someone comes out today. Tomorrow he is discredited in the media, the government says he never worked for the government and is just a crazy lunatic, and magically his computer and home is full of illegal shit that gets him sent to prison and labeled a fringe anti-government terrorist.</p>

<p>So in the eyes of the public we now have a criminal lunatic terrorist who hates freedom telling us how 9/11 was a fraud. Nobody will believe anything he says.</p>

<p>and as far as the us goes, you have got to understand this isnt something thrown together, the american gangster shadow state has been growing with impunity since ww2, by now people have spent their entire lives

<p>it could be controlled by aliens for all we know.  i just dont agree with even noam chomsky when he says the cia is controlled by the president, as if there is not some huge monstrous nasty cancer thing that has been growing on and becoming independent of the cia.  </p>

<li>Thomas Drake</li>
<li>Richard Grove</li>
<li>Susan Lindauer</li>
<li>Michael Springmann</li>

<p>Funny that you should mention NTD. Did you know that he <em>witnessed</em> the towers come down. You can read his account from the day after. He literally calls the blast that brought down wtc 1 a &quot;demolition style explosion&quot;. Google &quot;neil tyson 911 eye witness&quot; to read his account.</p>

<p>Neil Tyson DeGrasse eyewitness account:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4) As more and more and more and more and more emergency vehicles descended on the World Trade Center, I hear a second explosion in WTC 2, then a loud, low-frequency rumble that precipitates the unthinkable—a collapse of all the floors above the point of explosion. First the top surface, containing the helipad, tips sideways in full view. Then the upper floors fall straight down in a demolition-style implosion, taking all lower floors with it, even those below the point of the explosion. A dense, thick dust cloud rises up in its place, which rapidly pours through the warren of streets that cross lower Manhattan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main way our government protects classified information is through compartmentalization.  As an example, a person with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._security_clearance_terms#Security_levels">Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information</a> (TS/SCI) clearance is not necessarily privy to all things Top Secret.

<p>As such, it is quite common for GS 13 Jones in office A, and GS 13 Smith in office B to be working on the same project without knowing what the other is doing, or the true scope of the project.  </p>

<p>My response is that, to claim you know how many people would be required to do it, means that you claim to know exactly how it was done. No honest truther who cares about what really happened  is making this claim. So in that sense, it&#39;s a red herring argument.</p>

<p>all the <em>&#39;witnesses&#39;</em> from the day were NYC MSM execs (strangely people with no Wikipedia pages) and a few anchors, go watch the footage from the morning of the main TV channels, that days TV is fully available on archive.org.</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/sept_11_tv_archive">September 11 Television Archive</a></p>

<p>ABC is the only channel that captures the second plane hit into the South tower, all the rest were running Pentagon footage, and the ABC footage looks fake.</p>

<p>the TV companies have cameras on tripods filming the WTC within minutes of the first plane strike, but its very odd footage. a mix of stationary and video window zooming, plus some secondary camera footage, then the helicopters start filming. and some of their footage looks very odd too, almost impossible rotations of scenery.</p>

<p>one criticism of the assorted Utube videos could be that the quality is low, hard to interpret what happened from low res and fuzzy footage, but the TV on that day was low res and fuzzy, the Utube videos are just showing what the NYC MSM showed. CGIed footage.</p>

<p>the TV quality video from their own channels on the day is low quality, the video looks like its deliberately reduced in quality, exactly as if you were covering up CGI.</p>

<p>all TV people phoning in or being contacted for their <em>eye witness</em> comments.</p>

<p>9/11 in NYC at least was a MSM staged event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Manhattan Project is the best example of a massive conspiracy being kept completely secret. Hundreds of thousands of people, an entire city, for several years, kept the most dangerous secret of the day. We pride ourselves on that history, yet deny that the same phenomena could ever be employed against us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if you work in the private sector you have to sign a confidentiality agreement. You handle and work on many documents that are considered to be confidential. If any of those documents or information leak out you lose your job.   </p>

<p>Losing a long term job without a reference (or a bad reference) could destroy someones career.   </p>

<p>That fear along with drinking the cool-aid and being sold a slightly different story of events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how much of any specific conspiracy that I believe in but I do know this - on the Monday before, I was going to work listening to NPR and there was a story about how military bases were stepping up their security. They said there was no known threat - it was &#39;just being cautious.&#39; That was the first thing that popped into my head once we realized what was happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s one for ya the government only admitted to area 51&#39;s existence a couple of years ago! Pretty sure it&#39;s been there for decades. It&#39;s pretty clear at this point in history of all we&#39;ve learned about government corruption that they will do what they want and don&#39;t care what people think or say about it. If they think a person is very influential and a threat to their schemes or plots.......blam car accident, robbery/murder, they disappear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s odd you say that because you would think that with a little research you would know that the government admits the m to the bases existence. The name Area 51 isn&#39;t an official title for the base so they don&#39;t claim it as their name when asked. </p>

<p>The only misinformation floating around is the crap on this sub passed off as insider knowledge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s part of Edwards Air Base. It&#39;s also known as the Groom Lake airport. Area 51 is just a nickname that originates from a local map. Even a basic search will tell you that. It is a top secret facility and it did to advanced research. So they don&#39;t like to talk about what&#39;s going on because you don&#39;t have a clearance and you&#39;re a crazy nut bag. The only people spreading this myth are locals who own conspiracy related stores and theme shops. </p>

<p>The professional military doesn&#39;t have time for that bullshit so they don&#39;t address questions regarding area 51. It&#39;s stupid and you&#39;re asking them to break their contacts to secrecy by asking what&#39;s going on. Some of the most well known spy planes have come from there. </p>
