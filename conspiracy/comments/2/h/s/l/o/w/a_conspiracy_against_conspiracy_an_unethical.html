        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is a sub on reddit called <a href="/r/digitalcartel">/r/digitalcartel</a> where several redditors congregate to &quot;chat and debate&quot; according to them.</p>

<p>The reality is that this sub was created by <a href="/u/thedigitalking">/u/thedigitalking</a> who is an alt of a conspiratard user.</p>

<p>The story begins a little over a year ago when I noticed a user here posting YouTube videos they had made featuring them self sitting on a porch swing talking about their delusions (schizophrenic delusions).  This person thinks they are God and also the king of the CIA (whatever that means).  It was mostly harmless but a little disturbing to see this person suffering from a real mental illness and broadcasting it over YouTube.   The deeper they explored their own delusions the more it became clear that this person had the potential to cause harm to others.  They believed that natural disasters like hurricane sandy and national tragedies like the sandy hook shooting were done by the CIA specifically to punish them.  Regardless of your opinion of who did sandy hook or if lanza had any accomplices, I think we can all agree that they didn&#39;t so it to punish a kid named Eric who suffers from schizophrenia and thinks that he is god.</p>

<p>Here is where things went out of bounds in my opinion.  Some trolls that plague us here and are constantly on the lookout for anything they can use to &quot;make us evil&quot; noticed this kid and latched onto him.  They started feeding his delusions and calling themselves &quot;his disciples&quot;.  They created a special subreddit for him where he is the central figure, you can read about his delusions yourself in their sticky post.</p>

<p>The kid claims the navy yard shooter was being mind controlled in the same way that he himself is being mind controlled.  He talks about building a lead hut to escape from the voices.  </p>

<p>The ring leader there is a user <a href="/u/thedigitalking">/u/thedigitalking</a>, who has tried everything to get /conspiracy to make him or <a href="/u/ewolv">/u/ewolv</a> a mod here, or to get us to feature his story with a sticky.</p>

<p>When denied they have made threats and &quot;put us on a kill list&quot; </p>

<p><a href="/u/thedigitalking">/u/thedigitalking</a> talks to ewolv over skype and there is no telling what evil seeds he has planted in his mind there.  But its clear that &#39;king&#39; supports and reinforces this poor sick kid&#39;s delusions.</p>

<p>&#39;King&#39; has become this kids handler and he does everything and anything except steer this kid back towards reality.</p>

<p>If you look at the list of mods over there in their special subreddit you&#39;ll even find people there who are mods of prominent sub reddits like <a href="/r/askscience">/r/askscience</a>.</p>

<p>I believe that they intend to push this kid toward some kind of violent outburst IRL and then blame it all on /conspiracy.</p>

<p>Because of this, I have been keeping detailed logs of all the threats made to us in mod mail and the users inflating his ego in <a href="/r/digitalcartel">/r/digitalcartel</a>.</p>

<p>It all sounds like silly madness to us here but I remind you that the navy yard shooter tried to get help before his killing spree and people turned him away because they didn&#39;t see it as a serious matter.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/MWicoQN">http://imgur.com/MWicoQN</a></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/BrDyuRl">http://imgur.com/BrDyuRl</a></p>

<p>These are just a few examples of the threats we&#39;ve received from &#39;king&#39;.  Keep in mind that &#39;king&#39; is perfectly sane and is preying upon ewolv who is suffering from a serious mental disorder.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going public with this now because you can see for yourself how deep into the delusions ewolv has sunk.</p>

<p><strong>Edit there appears to be sort of internal examination of this over at <a href="/r/digitalcartel">/r/digitalcartel</a>, perhaps my bringing this to light will help them stop the exploitation of Eric</strong></p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2hslow/a_conspiracy_against_conspiracy_an_unethical/ckvpmny">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2hslow/a_conspiracy_against_conspiracy_an_unethical/ckvpmny</a></p>

<p>Mod of /digitalcartel (<a href="/u/cornroll">/u/cornroll</a>) explains how</p>

<blockquote>
<p>at first we were a cult community designed to create a following for the self proclaimed messiah.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hopefully they were &quot;unaware&quot; of his schizophrenia when they created a cult following for him..  otherwise that is just fucked up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>haha this is some of the best ironicism on the internet! </p>

<p>let&#39;s just recap a second;  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Flytape thinks that there is a shady group of people trying to discredit the subreddit he moderates, he thinks they&#39;re using CIA brainwashing methods which another used FerroFluid describes as being like &#39;MKUltra&#39; and that their method will be to cause a violent rampage akin to Sandy Hook...  </p>

<p>If digitalcartel is dangerously pandering to paranoid delusions then uh, you guys are just BEGGING for the majority of reddit to use this excuse to shut down conspiracy too...  </p>

<p>don&#39;t say no one didn&#39;t warned you...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The difference being that ewolv is admittedly schizophrenic and not on any meds.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen another user here objectively mentally I&#39;ll, and I&#39;ve also never seen anyone else on here suddenly surrounded by a group of people telling them that they are God!</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t see a clear difference between the two situations then something is wrong with you.</p>

<p>This sub is full of paranoid, delusional and probably schizophrenic people all feeding off each others delusions - if you can&#39;t admit you&#39;re crazy then you have to at least admit a lot of the people here are totally nuts.  </p>

<p>As for a group of people telling him he&#39;s god? that&#39;s a figment of your over active imagination, case in point to my previous statement...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mhmm.  I think you have a few things mixed up here.  I was added there fairly early on in that sub.  I was member 23 or something back when it was a private sub.   This was back when you needed to be nominated to join.  I still dont know who nominated me.  </p>

<p>Im pretty sure that <a href="/r/TheDigitalCartel">/r/TheDigitalCartel</a> is not there to make fun of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  I do think the <a href="/u/thedigitalking">/u/thedigitalking</a> is not sane like you suggest but crazy as well.  For some reason he decided to mod a few people who did not share his ideals and have a trollish side.   After the admins removed him as the top mod there he cant get rid of them now.  </p>

<p>I think he wants to mod here because he feels your users will believe him over regular users, sticky his message to gain more followers.  I dont think he is trying to troll you. </p>

<p><a href="/u/ewolv">/u/ewolv</a> is legit crazy and he seems to be getting worse.  I remember one time he thought the CIA was putting sharpies up his butt and thought the CIA was making his penis twitch using their mind powers or something.  </p>

<p>Yes he is getting worse.  I wonder if it has anything to do with his perception of having a bunch of disciples?  Regardless of why he is getting worse, when he breaks and hurts himself or someone else, if it makes national news I will be releasing my documents to the media.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t want my name on it.  Or blood on my hands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We aren&#39;t disciples, that&#39;s just a word. I did the css for the sub and I thought it was funny and it fits the theme of the sub. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll just cut and paste my explanation of what is happening there because I don&#39;t want this false idea of thedigitalcartel being spread around,</p>

<p>What is going on is you have one guy that is schizophrenic who thinks he is Christ returned, and another guy that believes in revelations in the bible and the second coming of Christ. Put them together, and they feed off each other. Everyone else that is there is normal and we do not support Eric&#39;s belief that he is Christ nor do we encouraging violence in any way.
So actually the people there are good decent people. It is the digitalking that is threatening people and we haven&#39;t the slightest clue why.</p>

You&#39;re a small group of trolls and snooneters who have devoted time to trolling a schizophrenic kid and telling him where to put his sharpies.

    <div class="md"><p>You need to understand that this is broadly being attributed to everyone in that sub like we are all in on it just to see how far we can push Eric. That isn&#39;t even slightly the case. The Digital Cartel is a place where ANYONE can say ANYTHING without fear of feeling judged or persecuted. At times the mix of people there has evoked some really interesting discussions and has yielded insights you can&#39;t find anywhere else on reddit. We are not violent, we are not trolls, we are not evil, we are not exploiting anyone, and we are not disciples of Eric. </p>

<p>What is going on is you have one guy that is schizophrenic who thinks he is Christ returned, and another guy that believes in revelations in the bible and the second coming of Christ. Put them together, and they feed off each other. Everyone else that is there is normal and we do not support Eric&#39;s belief that he is Christ nor do we encouraging violence in any way.</p>

<p>The reality is that this sub was created by <a href="/u/thedigitalking">/u/thedigitalking</a> [+44][2] who is an alt of a conspiratard user.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you can prove that the DigitalKing is from conspiratard then you should let me know asap... because if so, then the implications are quite damning. If ANYONE is exploiting Eric or pushing him to do anything destructive, the mods wouldn&#39;t stand for it. No one other than the digitalking knew of these threats or has any reason to threaten anyone. Personally, I actually think the digitalking is brainwashed by the bible to the point that he is also delusional and this is why he and Eric have latched on to each other.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t <em>think</em> the digitalking is exploiting him, it seems to me he really believes all of this stuff and revelations in the bible and the second coming and all of that. But like I said if you can prove he is an alt account of a conspiratard and he is just manipulating Eric let me know and me and the rest of the mods will make sure we put an end to it.</p>

<p>In the natural state of the universe good men will do good things and wicked men will do wicked things. But to make a good man do wicked things? You&#39;ll need religion... or a conspiratard it seems.</p>

<p>Once it became apparent to me that Eric was indeed a real schizophrenic with real delusions and DK was attempting to be his handler I started logging everything.  Its unfortunate that DKs participation in conspiratard isn&#39;t a part of that log.  We have so many trolls from there that he just blended into the crowd.</p>

<p>If I were you I would purge Eric&#39;s sub of DK and urge Eric to get back on his meds and quit using drugs.  Nicotine is documented to inhibit the antipsychotics used to treat schizophrenia and marijuana/alcohol to have undesirable effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen that subreddit around a bit. I first noticed it when I started getting mod mail demanding that I kneel before the King of Israel or other such nonsense. It would come about once a month and always from a different username, sometimes a shadowbanned one.</p>

<p>The whole thing is very sad, honestly. Eric seems to be a rather intelligent man, a mathematician, who at one point was diagnosed with schizophrenia. It seems the meds stopped working for him and his delusions ordered him to stop taking them altogether. He now thinks that he&#39;s some sort of messianic incarnation based on an oddly colored carp he once found. He&#39;s been posting on multiple accounts, many of which were banned. <a href="/r/digitalcartel">/r/digitalcartel</a> used to be a ground where he would post his ramblings and delusions, but recently has become a sort of conspiracy discussion center. I&#39;m not sure if the members are trolls, schizophrenics or just alt accounts of Eric. </p>

The worst part about it is the fact that EWOLV will never believe what anybody says unless his schizobrain agrees with it...so basically nothing anybody can say ever helps him out and he is constantly stuck in his own poor thoughts.  I wonder what his IRL friends and family think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unbelievable....</p>

<p>You misinterpreted cornroll, intentionally, and ignored my clarification, just to protect your fiction. What Cornroll was saying is that the digitalcartel was created by theDigitalKing to create a cult following for the self proclaimed messiah BUT as they started inviting people, the community started to realize what was going on and that there were delusional and mentally ill people involved and transformed it into something positive, where now <em>it is a nursery for those with mental wounds and has been used to create a lot of good</em>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually disgusted by the implications of this post and the constant reiteration of lies despite my attempts to bring real clarity to the situation. You people choose whatever dark reality you want to be true and then stick to it even if there is no evidence to support it and THAT is fucked up. I know DigitalKing has crossed the line, Im not defending him and his actions or his threats, but to make up a story just because one guy is delusional and paranoid, and claim there is a whole community of people trying to create the next adam lanza is absurd. Especially when most people here already believe all of these events were false flags, to turn all of the sudden and side with the idea that people are crazy and going to start shooting people, is mind blowing. You fold so easily on the root idea that is peddled in order to push controlling legislation on the people. People are inherently good, not inherently evil. So STOP shoveling the bullshit and start placing blame where it is due. Squarely on the DigitalKing, not because he is evil but because he is under the spell of the bible like billions of others in this world, which was put in place by the establishment 2000 years ago under the control of Constantine, because people started getting wise.</p>

<p>You are the people that need to be UNIFYING not blindly falling for this garbage being sold.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoever said that DigitalCartel was a &quot;cult subreddit&quot; is fucking retarded.  If DigitalKing said that, well then that is what he wishes it were but it&#39;s untrue.  It was never a &quot;cult subreddit&quot; LOL.  We all have different beliefs and don&#39;t follow a cult leader or specific dogma...in fact that is the point.  Most of us disagree with DigitalKing on many issues, but I feel like we do all try to find similarities beyond them.</p>

<p>Please understand that only one person may be attempting to manipulate EWOLV (and doubtfully), but definitely not the whole subreddit.  Yes, DigitalKing started the sub, but he isn&#39;t any sort of leader, members do not see themselves as disciples, and it is most definitely not a cult.</p>

<p>Edit: Cornroll you are not retarded but maybe you could have worded it differently haha... its technically true just horrible sounding taken out of context, whatever it doesn&#39;t matter :p</p>

    <div class="md"><p>actually it&#39;s a lot clever than you might think, a thirty second glance at any significantly complex subject will be enough to confuse anyone but once one starts to understand the language and structure of the information it becomes cohesive and begins to make sense.  </p>

<p>Society often tends to write off anyone that&#39;s outside the mainstream, especially if they can label their condition as a mental illness however the list of geniuses that suffer what&#39;d be considered a serious condition is quite considerable to the mighty greats of philosophy like Nietzsche to the luminaries of the ancient scriptures such as Ezekiel, with great insight often comes great mental stress; in mathematics we see similar things with amazing minds like Nash and Turing -- Turing&#39;s insight into the pattens of nature came about exactly because he was seeing the world through a different lens than most people, this mathematical insight into organic systems led to his revolutionary breakthroughs in computational mathematics and without a doubt changed the world as significantly as any scientist or mathematician ever has.  </p>

<p>It&#39;d take hours to get into it to any suitable degree but concepts and structures as described by ewol in regard to the sociological and psychological underpinnings of the modern theology [zeitgeist] explained and unveiled many things which i&#39;ve been trying to understand for over a decade - I&#39;ve read hundreds of books on theology including of course most the known holy books, once one begins to understand the structure of allegorical theology it becomes somewhat trivial to group ideas and constructs into established groups, generally it&#39;s easy to spot the idealised structure and the patching dogma - that which makes up the construct of the universe from their perspective and all the bits they needed to add or bend to make it work with our reality...  </p>

<p>the proto-orthodox Christian church in the first century for example has a very gnostic vision of the universe similar to many contemporaneous schools, many of the ideas largely made popular and discovered by the Pythagorean mystery school [and there&#39;s another genius with issues] - one can trace the growth of this by noticing how the central core philosophy get&#39;s patched in much the same way an evolutionary tree grows; ideas once central to the conceptualization of the Christ figure for example such as the trinity get pushed aside in later incantations of the Christian faith, this being a seemingly final step in it&#39;s development from the orginal mathematical ideal and it&#39;s use as a bridge between the messianic traditions of the spiritualists and the gnostic teachings of the scholarly traditions [as in, Egypt, Canaan, Greece, etc] </p>

<p>to cut a long story short what i&#39;m trying to say is if you understand the mechanics of theology and someone comes along with something that&#39;s not just kinda novel but actually goes right back to the very core issue and makes a change without it needing a million patches to get it to harmonise - that&#39;s actually really interesting. Kinda like editing the linux kernal while it&#39;s running and not causing any crashes with anything...  </p>

<p>Jesus is quoted as saying &#39;when you were one you became two, now you are two what will you do?&#39; i don&#39;t know but i&#39;m guessing this doesn&#39;t speak volumes to you? yet with an understanding of the gnostic perspective and a few bits of framework understood [such as &#39;as above, so below&#39; and &#39;i am the alpha and the omega&#39;] there&#39;s actually a lot in these statements.  </p>

<p>am i saying he&#39;s literally an incarnation of a divine christ? maybe, that depends very much on your interpretation and perspective on the christ, the divine, what it means to exist and to be an incarnation - i think there are likely many people who could and should be called christs; of course this doesn&#39;t mean i think he&#39;s the mythical person that&#39;s said to have walked on water and been martyred - i very much doubt the historicity of Jesus and i don&#39;t think that Erik or anyone else is a personification of the eternal christ as sometimes described [either a literal divinity or personified absolute].  </p>

<p>The DigitalKing believes in revelations in the bible and the second coming of christ and ewolv is schizophrenic and thinks he is Christ returned. The two are feeding off each other. No one other than the digital king supports ewolvs fantasy and for some reason you keep reiterating &quot;these people&quot; like there is some sort of group of people dedicated to fucking with Eric&#39;s head and people are upvoting you for your fiction because it&#39;s the &quot;white knight&quot; thing to do. Stop. It&#39;s not true.</p>

<p><strong><em>Or...</em></strong> And hear me out, but what if he is a troll, is well-versed enough in biblical text, and uses that knowledge to further convince Erik of his (for lack of a better word) delusions, to further an agenda?</p>
