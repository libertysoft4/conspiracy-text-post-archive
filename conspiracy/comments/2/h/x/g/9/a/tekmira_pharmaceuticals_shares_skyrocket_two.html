        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So with today&#39;s news of an Ebola case discovered in Texas, I decided to do a little research. Tekmira, the company trying to get it&#39;s Ebola vaccine approved, had a massive spike in shares earlier this year, before the Ebola outbreak in Africa was even reported. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/K6gAU">Have a look at these share prices</a> and let me know what you think.</p>

<p>&quot;As of 2014, an epidemic of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) is ongoing in West Africa. The epidemic was discovered in March 2014, but was later determined to have started in Guinea in <strong>December 2013</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On <strong>19 March</strong>, the Guinean Ministry of Health acknowledged a local outbreak of an undetermined viral hemorrhagic fever that had sickened at least 35 people and killed 23.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_virus_epidemic_in_West_Africa">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_virus_epidemic_in_West_Africa</a></p>

<p>Tekmira shares peaked on March 7, 12 days before Guinean authorities acknowledged the outbreak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think its even a little unlikely that a country experiencing an outbreak of some undetermined viral hemorrhagic fever would contact a company selling vaccines for viral hemorrhaghic fevers.</p>

<p>Dinners are eaten and hands are shaken and a couple nights later the right people know that there might potentially be demand for Tekmira&#39;s product.  Investments are made.</p>

<p>And a couple weeks later once Guinea has gotten its shit together enough to present to the world...authorities acknowledge the outbreak.</p>

<p>Thats my stab at a non-conspiracy explanation.  I don&#39;t think its unreasonable.</p>

<p>He just explained a series of events that most likely happened without any shadiness whatsoever.</p>

<p>If there was a perceived outbreak occurring or about to occur, a small company would need investors to be able to make enough medicine.  Smart investors would seize on the opportunity.  You can say it&#39;s deplorable for investors to want to make money off the medicine...but that&#39;s not a conspiracy, that&#39;s just greed.  It&#39;s also just an assumption that the people investing are doing it solely for the money.</p>

<li><p>There have been several Ebola outbreaks since it was first discovered in 1976. All previous outbreaks were minor and effectively contained. There was no reason to think this most recent outbreak would have been any different.</p></li>
<li><p>As you can see by the chart, Tekmira&#39;s share price started rising in January before anyone had any idea there was an Ebola outbreak. Why is this?</p></li>
<li><p>Ebola is classed as a biological warfare agent by the CDC. Merck Pharmaceuticals, the same company that kills teenage girls in doctors offices, was contracted to develop biological weapons by the US military after WWII. They had labs in Zaire, now know as the DRC, the same country where Ebola was first discovered. In 1975 the US ratified the Biological Weapons Convention, one year before the first outbreak of Ebola.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Every single outbreak has been successfully controlled, even the first one in 1976. So why wasn&#39;t it controlled in 2014? Maybe because Big Pharma has a vaccine now. They can let it get out of hand, terrorize the public into a frenzy then make massive profits while appearing to be the saviors of humanity. &quot;Bird flu&quot; terrorized the world and now everyone gets flu shots every year.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a stretch to assume Ebola is a manufactured virus, one of many, to be released when profits start to dip.</p>

<p>Scary shit. I don&#39;t think that he admitted to introducing AIDS to the US - I think he was just saying that those monkeys could likely have been HIV positive since they came from West Africa around that time, and they didn&#39;t know about HIV/AIDS then. They were test monkeys - they would be well guarded from spreading any kind of infection to people or even other lab animals. </p>

<p>I think he was pointing out some irony - that those monkeys could have had the AIDS virus in them, and he brought them here. But not that AIDS spread from them. </p>

<p>His point is more or less valid - at that time they weren&#39;t aware of the dangers of undetectable viruses, and he was pointing out what a disaster it could have become. But I don&#39;t think what he said added up to conspiracy - just the equivalent of 19th century doctors spreading infection because they didn&#39;t know to wash their hands. </p>

<p>But it certainly raises some scary points. These viruses <em>were</em> in vaccines, and could have spread through vaccinations and vaccination trials. I just don&#39;t think that he said that&#39;s how AIDS came about in humans.</p>
