<p>If you want to be rid of him, you need to convict him of a felony. If you somehow manage to do that, you get Biden. (And if GWB and Cheney weren&#39;t convicted of felonies they actually DID commit, GL getting Obama convicted.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To prove that particular mass murder on 9/11, you would need to prove GWB &amp; Cheney orchestrated it. If you can prove that, you will quickly become famous, rich, then probably dead.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t really asking your <em>opinion</em>, but rather your rationale behind calling for the prosecution of a sitting President, which usually means reasonable suspicion and proof of the committal of a felony.</p>

<p>What you have seems to be a dislike of a great many things but neither <strong>reasonable</strong> suspicion nor <strong>evidence</strong>. So it&#39;s just meaningless chatter. Rhetoric. Politicians do that a lot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, I&#39;m a shill. Because I ask questions and point out flaws in logic. Intellectual challenges can&#39;t be legit. They must be liars.</p>

<p>The &quot;top suspect&quot; in any crime is not taken into custody until sufficient evidence against them exists. The strength of the evidence required increases with the severity of the crime and notoriety of the suspect.</p>

<p>Oops, more rationality injected into your fantasy? Just invoke your cognitive dissonance and ignore it as &quot;shill&quot;.</p>

<p>I like the idea of charging our politicians/executives/shills who conspire to kill Americans under their own anti-terrorism laws and locking them up in the FEMA camps they meant for us. I go back and forth as to whether those 30,000 guillotines should be pressed into service, but it&#39;s not my decision to make.</p>
