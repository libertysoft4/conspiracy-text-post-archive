<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/axolotl_peyotl/comments/2bs5zp/rconspiracy_documentary_of_the_week_archive/">previous voting threads and winners</a></p>

<p>This film was nominated by <em>three</em> different folks this time, <a href="/u/sinominous">/u/sinominous</a>, <a href="/u/User_Name13">/u/User_Name13</a>, and <a href="/u/KayneC">/u/KayneC</a>.</p>

<p>We must all be on the same wavelength or something, because I was hoping to see this nominated as well. </p>

<p>It&#39;s time to stop letting our emotions interfere with how we view the past, especially the wars and other major events of the 20th century.</p>

<p>At the very least, this film will give you a different perspective.</p>

<p>Thanks again to all who voted, I&#39;m willing to wager that this is the only place on reddit where this film will be featured.</p>

<p>I know this material is very controversial but I think we are all used to controversial by now.  If you don&#39;t want to watch it then don&#39;t.  If you don&#39;t watch it then don&#39;t sit in here and have a melt down in the comments.</p>

<p>To everyone concerned about our &quot;reputation&quot; I think that is a silly idea that you have an anonymous reputation because you visited a website and created a username.  Please don&#39;t concern troll about a reputation that doesn&#39;t exist.  We aren&#39;t a homogeneous collective of people... we are all individuals.</p>

<p>To those who think (maybe even correctly) that this documentary was vote brigaded to the top,  please get a glass of ice and open a can of &quot;Hitler did nothing wrong&quot; sit back and enjoy the show.  Surely the existence of this one documentary isn&#39;t going to end the world, it will be up for a few days and then down the memory hole with everything else.</p>

<p>If you find yourself in a panic and forgot to bring a towel, a concierge will be around to your table shortly with a moist towelette.</p>

<p>And please remember to vote for Zaphod Beeblebrox</p>

<p><strong>Edit: Special thanks to <a href="/u/bipolarbear0">/u/bipolarbear0</a> for voting in favor of this documentary <sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>SRD</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>wink</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>was</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>that</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>less</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>than</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>12</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>hours?</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></strong>  please don&#39;t subpoena my info and take me to court bro!  Lol.  Srs business.</p>

<p><strong>I would also like to thank conspiratard and subredditdrama for mirroring this documentary on their front pages as well</strong></p>

<p><strong>There is no way that I can not thank 4chan for the special edition &quot;Hitler did nothing wrong&quot; mountain dew</strong></p>

<p>No one cared when we featured a documentary that claimed that cell phones are contributing to a cancer epidemic. </p>

<p>No one batted an eye when a featured documentary claimed that we were lied to about every aspect of 9/11, or that Al Qaeda was a product of Western intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>But oh no! A documentary that offers another perspective on World Wars I and II? Call the fucking admins!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m watching the documentary. I&#39;m about an hour and a half into it... It provides a different outlook on world war 2 thus far but in no way am I taking it in as propaganda.  I don&#39;t see what all the rage is about, unless later on it says the holocaust never happened or something? I&#39;m taking a break right now because it keeps freezing up (due to high volume of traffic I assume) but to anyone who feels iffy about watching this: don&#39;t. I actually recommend it. Especially if you&#39;re a history nerd like me. </p>

<p>I am in no way condoning the evil that is murder/genocide, by the way.. I do suggest watching this documentary, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m watching it too because of all the fuss everybody seems to be making about it.  i am noticing a definite bias, it is focusing mainly on russias evil deeds during ww-duece.  it goes pretty light on hilter (i&#39;m at 3:24:00)  still waiting to see what all the fuss is about,  does anybody have a link to relevant parts of the documentary i may have skipped over that warrant this kind of fussy bitching from people here?  </p>

<p>edit: maybe its the music they play in the background every time they feature a scene with hitler?  i mean they do seem to be glorifying him.  </p>

<p>edit2: oooooh they&#39;re claiming the deaths at auschwitz number has been manipulated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, as far as I can tell, they&#39;re at least partly right.</p>

<p>For 50 years people were told 4 million people died there.</p>

<p>Then in 1992, they changed it to 1.1 - 1.5 million.</p>

<p>1.5 million people is still awful, but what bugs me is what&#39;s behind that conflation.</p>

<p>I am not a neo-Nazi. I am a pacifist. What bothers me about the conflation of the evils of hitler is that it&#39;s used to justify the &quot;Good War&quot;. </p>

<p>We had to kill all the Germans we did, and get all our boys killed in WWII. We were fighting <em>evil</em>. Just like now, we have to kill ISIS. Because they&#39;re <em>evil</em>.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the lie we&#39;re told by the real evil ones who create these wars to fuel the war machine and line their pockets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bro, there&#39;s so much BS trying to make hitler look like a saint. Just ignore it and take in the good info. Even the music is pretty fucking cool if you don&#39;t let it trick you. Fantastic soundtrack in my opinion. It is what it is... Hitler was a horrible man but his story is interesting. </p>

<p>Edit: I know &quot;good&quot; info is subjective.. This is such a touchy comment section because I don&#39;t want to look like I&#39;m condoning his actions at all.  For me, personally, I&#39;ve learned a few things that I didn&#39;t know about ww2 and I love learning new stuff about history.. Nothing I&#39;ve learned changed my impression of hitler. </p>

<p>Really interesting movie especially looking at Hitler from someone elses eyes, who clearly thinks he is the bomb dot com. I&#39;m still a bit disturbed that it&#39;s in the sidebar as it would seem to be endorsing it. But I guess the reason we&#39;re all here is capacity for critical thought, time to exercise it some more and hope that this isn&#39;t used as propaganda fodder to delegitimize the subreddit as a whole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Iraq, rich in oil on the one hand and internally torn on the other, is guaranteed as a candidate for 
Israel&#39;s targets. Its dissolution is even more important for us than that of Syria. Iraq is stronger than 
Syria. In the short run it is Iraqi power which constitutes the greatest threat to Israel. An Iraqi-Iranian 
war will tear Iraq apart and cause its downfall at home even before it is able to organize a struggle on a 
wide front against us. Every kind of inter-Arab confrontation will assist us in the short run and will 
shorten the way to the more important aim of breaking up Iraq into denominations as in Syria and in 
Lebanon. In Iraq, a division into provinces along ethnic/religious lines as in Syria during Ottoman times 
is possible. So, three (or more) states will exist around the three major cities: Basra, Baghdad and 
Mosul, and Shi&#39;ite areas in the south will separate from the Sunni and Kurdish north. It is possible that 
the present Iranian-Iraqi confrontation will deepen this polarization.&quot;

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> doesn&#39;t exist in a bubble. Conspiracy theorists have done crazy, harmful things in the past based on shit similar to the video you linked (Anders Brevik being just the most recent example of neo-nazi terrorism). A lot of what Adolf Hitler himself though, especially the stuff that lead to him supporting extermination of Jews, was based on conspiracy theories that had already been debunked at the time. If you want to know more about that subject, look up the &quot;Stab in the back&quot; conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theories can be incredibly dangerous.</p>

<p>This subreddit posts all kinds of vile content on a daily basis. Many comments and posts call for violence against groups (I don&#39;t even have to name what groups, you already know). Many comments and posts suggest that users do things that may be dangerous to themselves (such as refuse to take medication). I&#39;m not even suggesting you get rid of it, just acknowledge that it can be harmful and take steps to minimize this harm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who is the &#39;people&#39; that you&#39;re referring to? What centuries?</p>

<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth">wikipedia</a>: &quot;Aristotle accepted the spherical shape of the Earth on empirical grounds around 330 BC, and knowledge of the spherical Earth gradually began to spread beyond the Hellenistic world from then on&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;During the 19th century, the Romantic conception of a European &quot;Dark Age&quot; gave much more prominence to the Flat Earth model than it ever possessed historically&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a myth that early modern Europeans believed the earth was flat, if that&#39;s what you mean.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s all kind of beside the point, since the &#39;fact&#39; that you&#39;re using to suggest current historians have no idea what they&#39;re talking about is untrue in itself.</p>

<p>Which kind of goes to prove the lack of scepticism, and lack of knowledge of history, that subscribers in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> exhibit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s arrogance to think that as a layperson you would know more &#39;truths&#39; about 20th century history than a historian does, just from watching a 6-hour shoddily-produced film.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hate to hijack the top comment but the butthurt in this thread is palpable.</p>

<p>People: open a fucking book or two.  The official story of WWII was written by the <em>victors</em> and is full of lies, omissions, and half truths.  There was a lot more going on behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Hitler and the Nazis were <strong>directly funded</strong> by the west, specifically Wall Street.  He literally signed an agreement with Zionist Jews in 1933 to transfer Jews to &quot;a new homeland&quot; in Palestine.</p>

<p>If you are offended by this movie being posted, maybe you should ask yourself why you have that immediate, visceral, instinctive negative reaction.</p>

<p>Also, if you haven&#39;t even watched the movie and/or have never looked into the claims of &quot;revisionists&quot; (hate that word), then what business do you have commenting here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about those articles is jaw-dropping or illuminating?  The repitition of the number 6 million?  Historically (before many left for Israel and the USA), the majority of Jews in the world lived in Central and Eastern Europe.  In these places, anti-semitism was prevalent long before the First World War, in fact it had existed for centuries.<br/>
There were over ten million Jews in continental Europe within the timespan covered in this video, and the articles are right in that many of them faced difficult struggles in that period.  This is a fact.  Whether all of them were at risk of dying violently during this period is another question, but journalists sensationalizing things is hardly new.<br/>
Oh, and the word &quot;holocaust&quot; was used to describe massacres before it came to represent the acts of the Third Reich, so there is nothing unusual about it being used in that context.<br/>
The repetition of the same exact number is an interesting coincidence, but seeing as the number of Jews in these regions was in that order of magnitude, and there are undoubtedly countless articles on similar topics with different numbers, this seems like just that - coincience.  Obviously articles would not have been selected to appear in the video if they did not contain the exact number, so the presence in this video of articles with the number 6 million isn&#39;t really surprising.</p>

<p>Could you please clarify how this video is supposed to prove or even question anything?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the Jews were the first &quot;different&quot; group of immigrants that the people of central and western Europe were experiencing on an ongoing basis.  They looked different, they spoke a different language, and they had their own culture <em>and religion</em>.  And here they come to settle in our village!</p>

<p>People worried that the Jews had a higher solidarity with other Jews around the world than with the local culture and its kings and it&#39;s rulers.  They thought of Judaism as a &quot;state without borders&quot; that was kind of &quot;floating across Europe&quot;.  Who were the Jews going to back if times get tough?  What if Kingdom X goes to war Kingdom Y?  Are the Jews in each country going to fight each other as is their duty?  Or are they going to try to work together for their own interests?  &quot;Who do they really serve?  Where is their true allegiance?&quot;  (.. went the argument)</p>

<p>The Jews were medieval money lenders.  Christians were forbidden from engaging in &quot;usury&quot;, so the Jews did it.  They loaned money for interest.  It&#39;s an inherent part of our western economic system.  But you know who is unpopular?  The guy who is coming to collect the money you owe him.  HOW GREEDY!   And of course, it made a lot of money for Jewish families.  So when times got tough, poor Farmer Johan is looking up at the estate of Isaac the Moneylender .. saying &quot;how come <em>he</em> has so much money?  He bought his things with <em>our</em> interest payments!  And now times are tough for us, our crops are having some bad years, and there he is with all his coins!  His people aren&#39;t even from here like we are!  They shouldn&#39;t be allowed to prosper when we, the natives, are suffering!&quot;</p>

<p>And .. let&#39;s not forget the Jews do not accept Jesus as Saviour.  This is a pretty &quot;big fucking deal&quot; any time before the 18th century.  Catholics and Protestants even differed enough to start wars with each other.  This was a whole other level.</p>

<p>Those are just some of the reasons (You know .. outside of the whole &quot;starting plagues and stealing children&quot; thing) that Jews wound up on the end of the &quot;hating stick.&quot;</p>

<p>Do you really thing people just wake up one day and decide to hate Jews for no reason at all? Just because they are jewish?</p>

<p>The fact is they lied about six million. Not many people think like you that Jews are above criticism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of <em>course</em> anti-semitism had historical reasons - it didn&#39;t just happen.  I don&#39;t actually have a very good understanding of what those reasons are, but I am quite confident that they were (1) not always entirely baseless and (2) not adequate to justify what the Jewish people were subjugated to.  Anti-semitism is something I would like to understand better than I do.<br/>
To clarify, who lied about &quot;six million&quot; and it what context?  My understanding of the holocaust deaths figure is that it depends enormously on who you ask and how you count it (who counts as a Jew?  Which deaths count as &quot;part of the holocaust&quot;).  6 million seems to be the general consensus when asking historians and applying the widest conditions - if you can give examples of respected historians who disagree then I would happily entertain what they are saying.<br/>
The articles mentioned in the video may be lying or misleading when they say &quot;six million&quot;, but the sentiment and scale they convey is not entirely inaccurate.<br/>
Nobody is above criticism, especially not if they lie to achieve their ends.  I just think that, in the case of the Holocaust, some Jews may be using it to push their agenda but the facts they are using are true.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say Hitler was alright, besides there were tens of thousands of Jews fighting in the Wehrmacht so it wasn&#39;t just blanket &quot;anti semitism&quot;. </p>

<p>Six million isn&#39;t a magic number, it&#39;s just a talking point that&#39;s been over used like the boy who cried wolf.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure in 50 years we&#39;ll hear about how the Palestinians killed six million jews and thats why Israel had no choice but to expand from the Suez Canal to Tehran....</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Jews killed tens of millions of whites in peacetime USSR</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you mean?  I know the the Soviet leadership killed millions, and some small but significant fraction of said leadership was Jewish (a similar fraction of the total population was Jewish, so this is no surprise).  Is this what you are referring to?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>all Hitler wanted to do was deport them to Vichy French controlled Madagascar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How nice of him.  Too bad he killed them instead.  It is interesting that some Jews fought in the German army, but that doesn&#39;t erase the genocide.  There is nothing that can make it acceptable to kill any number of people simply for their ethnicity or for the crimes of others (even if Jews played a more significant role than myself or historians think in, say, events in the USSR, that still would not justify action against even other Jews in Russia, let alone those in Germany or Poland).</p>

<p>I agree that the millions of deaths in the Holocaust have been used in rhetoric to support decisions on which they have no bearing, but that does not make the number false.  </p>

<p>I also agree that Israel has done many things wrong, and it is important that an equitable and stable solution be found for affairs in the Middle East.  However, despite fears of misusing the term as it is so often misused, I feel compelled to say that the sentiment of your comment comes off as a bit anti-semitic itself, and does not seem like the kind of outlook that will be at all helpful in resolving anything.</p>

<p>The man with the Irish accent keeps referencing article after article where &quot;6 million jews&quot; <em>are not exterminated</em>. So why does this have anything to do with pumping up holocaust extermination numbers??!</p>

<p>And the articles are talking about Jews in Russia, Ukraine, Poland being under pressure/experiencing persecution. Yet he keeps saying &quot;blah blah years <em>before</em> Adolf Hitler ever set foot in the government&quot;. </p>

<p>Well, these articles <em>aren&#39;t talking about</em> Hitler&#39;s persecution of Jews, but about persecution going on before Hitler arrived. Why is it &quot;jaw dropping&quot;??</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of the transfer agreement in 1933?  Zionists worked <em>directly</em> with Hitler and the Third Reich to create a Zionist homeland in Palestine.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible that certain wealthy crypto-Jews within the international finance world would fund both sides of a war, as they had done for almost all wars from the previous 200-300 years, and use other Jews as a &quot;shield&quot; for their crimes?  And this isn&#39;t to say that it was <em>only</em> Jewish bankers who funded Hitler, it&#39;s just to say that <em>some of those who did fund him</em> were Zionist Jews and their cohorts.</p>

<p>This would prevent people such as yourself from ever looking into the realities of who funded who during WWII because you&#39;re blinded by what you perceive to be &quot;anti-semitism&quot; on the part of people like me when really that couldn&#39;t be further from the truth.</p>

One died from typhus in 1945 and one was ransomed for what is still a world record for one person.

<p>Lol.  You&#39;re a poor grammar Nazi.  Too funny!</p>

<p>If your writing abilities were up to par, I wouldn&#39;t have to guess at wtf you are saying here.  Are you asking a question, making a statement, or trying to insult me?  If you&#39;re attempting to insult me, fuck you.  If you are making a statement, try rewording it&#39;s a bit confusing.  If you are asking why I disagree with this documentary?  Well, other than the conclusion of: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hitler was probably the hero of the second world war and the 21st century. A man of ethical courage, a man of spiritual perception and good intent. A spiritual soul who cared – cared about all life forms, all cultures, about goodness and Light and ultimately about Truth.</p>

<p>Because he was one of the good guys.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I 100% disagree.  Any person that resorts to torture, murder, and manipulation of the masses is NOT one of the good guys.</p>

<p>I would have to say this video conveniently downplays events of significant importance.  Like the Reichstag fire, or the overthrow of a Democracy to a Dictatorship, just to name a couple.  It mentioned these topics, but then conflates other events to make it seem as though they were needed, appropriate, and beneficial to German society.  I disagree.  I think these events degraded German culture, and opened the door for this (your) perverse ideology to spread.</p>

<p>As a Voluntaryist/Libertarian we share very little common political/social/spiritual ground.  Which is fine by me.</p>

<p>Now, just to be clear, I am NOT saying that history depicts the true image of Hitler and the events surrounding the World Wars.  Quite the contrary.  But neither does this video.</p>

<p>Now, if you are done insulting my reading comprehension?  Might I suggest you brush up on just who is guiding your movement?  I&#39;ll post a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kyu6CPlEx0Q">video</a>, just in case those words are too hard to comprehend.</p>

<p>Dear God dude, you fucking suck at writing.  Grammar man, it makes a world of difference.  I get what you are saying here, I think, but for future reference you might want to reword that canned response.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t explain any?  Here&#39;s one.  Immigration enriches the lives of the people who move out of the slums to a less violent, more abundant society.  For example, you and your family (unless you&#39;re Native American which I highly doubt).</p>

<p>Colonialism is evil, but multiculturalism is not? Gotta love that marxist hypocrisy. Why would we want them to bring their hell here&gt; </p>

<p>Why did you cross out white? It was almost ALL white children abused by Pakistani muslim child service workers. A predictable failure of &quot;multiculturalism&quot; . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As to your link:  I do not believe your genetic sequence, while different from such a tiny percentage of Africans, makes you superior.  Different, Yes. </p>

<p>You have to remember that most black people found almost anywhere else in the world today have a bit of Caucasian or other genes in them.  Thanks to Colonialism.</p>

<p>Guess what?  That makes them just as genetically &#39;superior&#39; as you.  Based on your evidence and logic, you must agree that damn near every mother fucker on this planet is just as equally &#39;superior&#39; as you.</p>

<p>I guess you can debate the finer point of who&#39;s more pure than who (whom? that one always gets me), but I think that&#39;s just grasping at straws.  Who&#39;s to say that one particular genetic trait will continue to keep you superior?  Now that everyone&#39;s got it, it makes sense that another genetic anomaly might evolve and get passed on.</p>

<p>Either way, as for that minuscule group of African people; just because they are different than you, doesn&#39;t mean they deserve to be treated any worse or better than you.  It&#39;s called kindness man.</p>

<p>As to multiculturalism:  Dude, get over it.  Its happened.  You and I were born into it.  You aren&#39;t going to stop it, and any attempt to reverse it is futile.  Not only that, but I have found it very enlightening to understand other cultures on a personal level. </p>

<p>Shit, you won&#39;t believe it (no you probably will), but the one human I hold in the highest regard happens to be a Jew.  Shocking, I know.  His name, Yeshua (spelling my vary).    </p>

<p>Serious question:</p>

<p>I read before, in a comment of yours, that you profess to be a man of God.  Please elaborate.</p>

<p>How about the fact they still live in the stone age in 2014? </p>

<p>What problem is that of yours?  Seriously, we just acknowledged you are talking about a tiny fraction of Africans.  Other than for humanitarian issues, why do you care how they live?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just think people should live and work in their own country, travel and trade is fine. However if the best and brightest keep leaving the third world, then the third world will never advance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, we are getting the best and the brightest to immigrate here.  Good for us.  However, I would have to agree that positive change for any nation must come from within.  So, I guess we agree here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Multiculturalism fails us all, also it&#39;s extremely new and an already failred experiment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I guess that&#39;s your opinion.  I disagree.</p>

<p>I would still like to hear about your thoughts on God.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not an opinion, multiculturalism is a path of ruin. </p>

<p>They can&#39;t cut it, so they need legislation that favors them (affirmative action) at the expense of whites. </p>

<p>Because you said you were a man of God, and that intrigues me way more than the topic at hand.  I grow tired of this point, counter-point.  This shit could go on for ages.  You know it.  I know it.  The fucking NSA/CIA/FBI/DHS agents reading this knows it.  If you really are who you claim to be, and I know who I am ;), it&#39;s safe to say this conversation is being monitored.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve entertained your points to the conclusion of agree to disagree.  Trying to &#39;prove&#39; each other &#39;wrong&#39; is pointless, and a waste of time.</p>

<p>Enlighten me.</p>

<p>10 REASONS WHY HITLER WAS ONE OF THE GOOD GUYS</p>

<p>1/. He never wanted to kill any Jews</p>

<p>2/. He cared about conditions for the Jews in the work camps</p>

<p>4/. He tried to prevent the destruction of his fellow Europeans<br/>
Numerous occasions Hitler tried to warn and assist his fellow brethren about the Jewish trap they had fallen for and who really was behind all the warmonger. </p>

<p>In Conclusion<br/>
Hitler was probably the hero of the second world war and the 21st century. A man of ethical courage,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, this documentary is shit. But I strongly disagree that it shouldn&#39;t be posted here. We are constantly bombarded by holocaust religious propaganda. The first duty of a free thinker is to counter that type of shit. Also it trolls the rabid tyrans who support that mainstream propaganda and sends a big fuck you their way. All good. And I frankly don&#39;t care if people fall for the shit that&#39;s in this documentary. They&#39;ll grow out of it, or not. And yes, it is a honeypot and a trap: by promoting a delusional pro Hitler narrative, they make sure that the people who disbelieve in the holocaust bullshit will remain neutralized because they believe in just as big a pile of shit that wonderfully also happens to discredit them durably towards the majority of good sheeple. Yea, it stands to reason that this documentary is made by Jews. To neutralize anti holocaustianism. To keep the fringe repulsive to the herd.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe the fucking brouhaha and the <em>moaning</em> and the <em>whining</em> and the <em>kvetching</em> over that fucking image. <strong>Get in trouble</strong> for having a mocking caricature of famous political personality on your screen? Some days I wonder if I&#39;m living in a freakish parallel universe.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a shocker: <strong>The original artwork was done by an ISRAELI ARTIST</strong> - one of many similar &quot;portraits&quot;.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2011/07/28/noma-bar-guess-who/">Noma Bar’s Minimalist Vector Portraits of Cultural Icons</a></strong></p>

<p>Here is the original - juxtaposed to a <em>plagiarized version</em> that appeared on the cover of - wait for it - <strong>Przekrój, Poland&#39;s oldest weekly news magazine</strong>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/assets_c/2011/09/nomabarcopycat-thumb-615x438-62303.jpg">PNSFW???</a></strong></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a link to the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/09/lessons-in-plagiarism-from-przekr-j-polands-oldest-weekly/244553/">2011 Atlantic article</a> on the plagiarism.</p>

<p>So all of this whining and handwringing has been because <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was SO INSENSITIVE that it posted a (totally excellent) piece of art done by an <strong>Israeli Jew</strong> on its sidebar???</p>

<p><strong>ARE YOU PEOPLE FUCKING CRAZY???</strong> Grow a pair!</p>

<p>Here are a few more of Noma Bar&#39;s totally excellent pieces - which of THESE will you whiners say are NSFW?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/nomabar_guesswho_stalin.jpg">Josef Stalin</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/nomabar_guesswho_nelsonmandela.jpg">Nelson Mandela</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/nomabar_guesswho_kimjongil.jpg">Kim Jong Il</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/nomabar_guesswho_margaretthatcher.jpg">Margaret Thatcher</a></p>

<p>and of course <strong><a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/nomabar_guesswho_hitler.jpg">NSFW!!!!</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Is ISIS scary?</strong></p>

<p>No, ISIS isn&#39;t scary - the idea of living in a culture and a time where one could &quot;get in trouble&quot; for having a minimalist caricature of Adolf Hitler on your monitor - THAT IS FUCKING SCARY.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found the documentary extremely interesting. It wasn&#39;t &quot;pro Hitler&quot; exactly, it sure did focus on the German plight and why he did what he did. It avoided some negative things that other docs mention but it gave an alternative perspective that has been COMPLETELY missing from our history books. That alone is both cause for concern and reason for some happiness. </p>

<p>I think when we make things illegal to challenge, we are boxing ourselves in for further Tyranny. </p>

<p>A very very basic premise exists, and we should all keep this in mind:
TRUTH FEARS NO INVESTIGATION. Think about that. Nothing should be off limits. Let the evidence speak for itself and now as we look back on some atrocities, let&#39;s not blame it all on one man as has been happening since WWII, lets look into why it happened, how it happened, and at what the Allies did as well. Let&#39;s look at the stories we have been told and then at all the other books who using first hand accounts and mountains of evidence, do not match what our school systems told us (big shocker)...</p>

<p>Keep leaders on their toes, not in their thrones...</p>

<p>To anyone that&#39;s interested in more of this, I would recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hellstorm-Death-Nazi-Germany-1944-1947/dp/097138522X">Hellstorm: The Death Of Nazi Germany, 1944-1947</a> by Thomas Goodrich. Hellstorm tells the story of German suffering at the hands of the Allies. You learn, from the victims themselves, what it felt like to be in Hamburg during the US/UK firebombing and to witness the brutality of the Soviet Asiatic horde.  </p>

<p>Goodrich wrote a similar book called &quot;Scalp Dance&quot; about the experience of American pioneers who battled with Indians on the Great Plains. My god, the horrors!  </p>

<p>The Indians, inured to this torture ethos, naturally fought one another to their last breath. The whites were at first astonished by this persistence, and most of the soldiers of the 18th Infantry had long since made unofficial pacts never to be taken alive. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t try to talk about overlooking the &quot;crimes of the Indians&quot; like its at all equivalent to what we suffered FIRST at colonial hands. And we HELPED you. You didn&#39;t conquer anything in the east, you were accepted into the neighborhood.  I&#39;m not sjw about this, I just think it sucks when your historical friend turns on you. Not about victimhood, I&#39;d rather we teach about plains tribes ritually murdering invaders and also teach about all the industrial waste dumped on native reservations. And why? For what? Why be such assholes that corporations never suffer for it? No loyalty, no honor. Give us reservations, which could actually be great sources of community building and a refuge, then spitefully salt the earth beneath us.</p>

<p>I applaud your looking into history and I would have none of it buried.  More context for my race&#39;s actions historically makes us more sympathetic. Same for your people.

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t mean to suggest you favored suppressing historical facts.</p>

<p>The history of relations between Indians and white settlers has been whitewashed. This whitewash has tended to err on the side of portraying Indians as blameless and whites as coldhearted oppressors. The orthodox narrative tends to ignore instances when Indians didn&#39;t have clean hands and times when whites were victims.</p>

<p><strong>My point is the story could easily be biased in the opposite direction.</strong> Indeed, it would be in the interest of white Americans to highlight Indian atrocities to limit their own blame.</p>

<p>I pointed out a book that tells history from a perspective that is now seldom heard. I referred to &quot;horrors&quot; suffered by pioneers and you responded by tut-tutting about death marches. <em>That is exactly the problem I&#39;m talking about</em>. Those facts have implications that upset the way we think about the past, which is exactly why they are cast aside.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I spoke from a position of ignorance, obviously I jumped on a particular phrasing.  I hope at least my response gave you insight in some way.  White guilt is wrong, I am not in favor of blaming descendants or of Joe Taxpayer, or you, feeling guilty about the past.  What&#39;s done is done.  Being good neighbors <em>now</em> is what&#39;s important.  At least honoring border agreements that are on the books... a little respect, not even a bailout...</p>

<p>The victim narrative actually damages our own self-image (in addition to not being as cut-and-dry as it&#39;s portrayed) because it disempowers us.  I should say again I am <em>not interested</em> in creating white guilt, I believe in white power, black power, red power.  Have pride... and give respect.</p>

<p>My research has led me to some complex beliefs on shared native and European history. I <em>would never</em> try to downplay the scale and quality of Native violence toward pioneers. Your post wasn&#39;t an academic paper, you had no responsibility to give more context for that violence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. I totally agree with you on the victim narrative and its ability to disempower. Not only does it encourage <em>you</em> to see yourselves as helpless, it also encourages <em>us</em> to see you as helpless.</p>

<p>Anyway, my original point was that every story has two sides, even WWII and American colonialism. The more the popular narrative skews in favor one side, the more the other side becomes evil monsters as is the case with the Nazis and American settlers to some extent. Moreover that whole thing about learning from the past becomes more difficult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/pR9F8uK.png">It certainly was savage</a>.* The notion that Indians merely wanted the white man to leave is nonsense—maybe that helps justify it in your mind—but they also mutilated members of enemy tribes in the same disgusting fashion. They lived in a constant state of warfare.</p>

<p>Yes, Americans nearly brought about the extinction of the buffalo, but it&#39;s unlikely the Indians were very concerned about this. You have to keep in mind Indians believed Buffalo came from an underground cave and were endlessly reincarnated. Indians were also known for driving <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Y55r1zY.jpg">whole herds of buffalo off cliffs</a> and wasting all but the best meat. The idea that Indians were conservationists has long been debunked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not when the premise of the attachment is that your ancestors were born there...</p>

<p>If the truth is that their ancestors, were in fact, Khazar - than it throws a wrench in the whole &quot;Right to Return&quot; (that&#39;s literally what its called: <strong>Return</strong>) doctrine. When your &quot;attachment&quot; to a thing is based on an ideology that understands your bloodline as tracing back to a certain geographic location - than no, I&#39;m sorry, it does not apply.</p>

<p>There are Jews who are religious Zionists as well - in that case, yes, it makes sense for them to feel an attachment to that land without a genealogical tradition. But religious Jews are a minority in Israel. What was understood as Judaism in 750 AD isn&#39;t that same as what it means to be &quot;Jewish&quot; today.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All of the abrahamic religions (gotta be like 75% of people) want Jerusalem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not at all. Only Islam and Judaism make a claim to Jerusalem. Christians might feel an endearment to Jerusalem and many Arab Christians suffer life there the same way Arab Muslims do - but Christian religious scripture doesn&#39;t dictate an attachment to it. And most of the people who actually do feel an attachment to it that happen to be Muslim are Palestinians, people who&#39;ve lived there for several hundred years. These people aren&#39;t substantially different than the Jews who lived there before Balfour or the Christians - all living in peace somehow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel could not have been born, but for the story of the story of the &quot;six million.&quot; The creation of the Jewish state depended on the massive invasion of Jews from all over the world into Palestine and a successful war of terror against both the British who administered the region under a League of Nations mandate and against the regions native inhabitants. The displaced Jewish populations of Europe were a tremendous source of immigration to Palestine. </p>

<p>Without that emigration, it is doubtful that the relatively small prewar Jewish population there could have wrested control from the British and the native Palestinians. The Zionist military takeover of Palestine required vast economic, military, and political support from around the world. It entailed the terrorization of the Palestinian majority, driving them from their homes and lands and denying them their civil and political rights. Only the perpetuation of the Holocaust story could make these crimes tolerable in world opinion. Sympathy for the Jews, deeply stirred by recollections of the Holocaust, made whatever grievous offenses committed against Palestinians, no matter how unjust, seem trivial. </p>

<p>The Holocaust story has generated tens of billions of dollars of aid from the United States and even greater amounts from Germany in reparations. Perhaps most importantly, the Holocaust was the fuel that fired the flame of Jewish Zionism all over the world. Recital of the Holocaust united Jews worldwide and elicited the huge monetary and political support necessary for the establishment and maintenance of Israel. After 50 years of almost unbroken conflict with the Palestinians and her Arab neighbors, Israel still completely depends upon American and German support. </p>

<p>Israel remains America&#39;s biggest annual recipient of foreign aid, just as it has been since her foundation. Constant harping on the Holocaust keeps the money flowing from both Jews and non-Jews and forms a subtle excuse for every injustice committed against the Arabs. </p>

<p>In 1989 Auschwitz lost a few million people from their official count</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For those who don&#39;t know the story: From 1945 to 1989, a plaque at the front gate proclaimed in many different languages that 4.1 million victims had died there. During a visit to the camp in June 1979, Pope John Paul II stood before this monument and blessed the four million victims&#39; souls. It turned out that three million of the souls were 
imaginary. </p>

<p>Shortly after the pope&#39;s visit, with no fanfare or publicity, the camp historians removed the plaque and replaced it with one reflecting the new official figure: 1.2 million. For many years, the officially declared six million Jewish victims of the Holocaust included the four million supposedly killed at Auschwitz. Interestingly, when the Auschwitz figure was reduced by about three million, there was no rush to correct the encyclopedias or the endless stories quoting the six million figure. </p>

<p>Jewish revisionist David Cole traveled to Auschwitz in September, 1992. Wearing a Yarmulke, he interviewed the curator, Dr. Francizek Piper, who admitted that while the &quot;official tour guides&quot; tell the visitors the gas chamber is exactly as it was when the camp was liberated, it is actually a &quot;reconstruction.&quot; That revelation is just one of the gaping leaks in the bow of battleship Auschwitz, the mothership of the Holocaust fleet. Cole was subsequently beaten up and his life threatened repeatedly.</p>

<p><strong>note:</strong>  After much intimidation Cole later repudiated his revisionist viewpoints, but the tape of Francizek Piper remains. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I upvoted you but I would respond that to me viscerally, it is the idea of the systematic, industrialized gassing of people by a democratic nation that made that particular aspect of the many massacres that occured the most horrific. I willfully admit I am minimally educated on the events of WWII however, and with modern day Zionism do not deny in the least the fact that it is continually used to justify even more bloodshed and favoritism. The more you look at the world, the more it appears to be some kind of hellish, nightmare slaughterhouse with a very thin veneer of bullshit on top that no one dare peer beneath because the underlying reality is so terrifying. Perhaps awakening to all the lies will set us free once we can clearly identify those lies.</p>

<p>Anyone who says &quot;I believed the Holocaust happened&quot; doesn&#39;t really understand the debate. It&#39;s not an all or nothing argument. It&#39;s not about &quot;happened - didn&#39;t happen&quot;. The Holocaust is a whole spectrum of asserted events and incidents. Some happened, some didn&#39;t happen, some happened but have been exaggerated, some were lied about, some have been misinterpreted, and so on.</p>

&quot;Iraq, rich in oil on the one hand and internally torn on the other, is guaranteed as a candidate for 
Israel&#39;s targets. Its dissolution is even more important for us than that of Syria. Iraq is stronger than 
Syria. In the short run it is Iraqi power which constitutes the greatest threat to Israel. An Iraqi-Iranian 
war will tear Iraq apart and cause its downfall at home even before it is able to organize a struggle on a 
wide front against us. Every kind of inter-Arab confrontation will assist us in the short run and will 
shorten the way to the more important aim of breaking up Iraq into denominations as in Syria and in 
Lebanon. In Iraq, a division into provinces along ethnic/religious lines as in Syria during Ottoman times 
is possible. So, three (or more) states will exist around the three major cities: Basra, Baghdad and 
Mosul, and Shi&#39;ite areas in the south will separate from the Sunni and Kurdish north. It is possible that 
the present Iranian-Iraqi confrontation will deepen this polarization.&quot;

Another user, probably from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>, also admitted to sending &quot;threats.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, I wonder if you would be accusing me of an &#39;association fallacy&#39; if this documentary had been called Evolution: the Greatest Story Never Told, and the only information I could find about it came from bestbiblescience.com, creationsciencetoday.com, etc.</p>

<p>No, that would not work because the only evidence you would have to support your claim is somebody else talking about that user, there is no logical association that can be created due to a random person talking about a different person.</p>

<p>Somebody having talked about somebody else on a bestiality website, does not equate to somebody else being into bestiality, anybody can talk about anybody, what you are saying is bullshit.</p>

<p>This is entirely different, as apparently this video is actually hosted by multiple white supremacist sites.</p>

<p>Now, SOME of the gas chamber claims were exaggerated, but there were most definitely gas chambers where they exterminated people using Zyklon-B. </p>

<p>Read this <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/faqs/auschwitz/auschwitz-faq-06.html">research article with supporting evidence</a>.</p>

<p>You know why Holocaust denial is illegal in Europe?</p>

<p>Because They don&#39;t have the first amendment, and the holocaust most certainly happened, are you fucking retarded?</p>

<p>Or did the allies build half destroyed prison, labor, and concentration camps to fool the future about the Nazis?</p>

<p>Give me a fucking break.</p>

<p>None so far as I know.</p>

<p>No topic should, that&#39;s why America&#39;s awesome, mostly, because we pretty much can question anything, doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re going to get answers though.</p>

<p>We have a first and second amendment, you know, sort of reasons we left Europe in the first place.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t enjoy living in fascist hell holes.</p>

<p>Too bad the whole world is turning into one.</p>

<p>That&#39;s kind of the NWOs&#39; goal though, and large majorities of people still don&#39;t even believe the NWO is a real thing, they think it&#39;s all phooey.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying that it being on a white-supremacist website makes the video white-supremacist.</p>

<p>I am alleging that the only reason it would be hosted on multiple sites of that sort, is that there is something about it that they agree with, so at the very least, it&#39;s not pro-Jew or pro-Israel.</p>

<p>It being not pro-Jew or pro-Israel doesn&#39;t make it anti-Jew or anti-Israel either.</p>

<p>But yet again, at the very least, it must not be promoting any form of Jewry, excuse the dated term.</p>

<p>I have not watched the video, because I do not care to use my time for reasons that I feel that yes, the claims were exaggerated like the human skin lamp and bones and such being used to make soap and buttons, but that there were prison camps, labor camps, and extermination camps.</p>

<p>At some of these extermination camps, there were gas chambers as it is provably a very effect method of killing many people at once without having to line them up and shoot them or do other physically brutal harm to them. The Zyklon-B gas is deadly, which is why they used it, and wore respirator masks while dousing them with it.</p>

<p>Sorry about the &quot;fucking retarded&quot; question, I just want us all to be realistic here about this and not actually deny real history which was documented on documents that survive to this day, and physical video evidence which can be analyzed and dated so as to be proven real.</p>

<p>I am of the believe that a lot of history is most definitely covered up, and that it is by whomever the people are that comprise the Illuminati.</p>

<p>Since I believe in God, however, I believe that the aliens are actually demons tricking the insanely corrupt and psychopathic world political and military leaders into believing they are aliens, but that&#39;s just me.</p>

<p>I think <a href="/u/mr_dong">/u/mr_dong</a> would disagree with me, but hey, that&#39;s why it&#39;s <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, because we&#39;re all entitled to our own beliefs, but we still need to admit what is actually true in reality, is true.</p>

<p>I could go on and on, because it&#39;s so easy to disprove other world religions that aren&#39;t Christianity it&#39;s insane, but let&#39;s save those debates for threads where that&#39;s the focus, because this has most certainly shifted far beyond the content of this submission and I am most certainly not attempting to derail or anything, I&#39;m just super long winded, check the proper grammar and my post history lol.</p>

<p>Stop purposely presenting logical fallacies as if anybody thinks that way, I already addressed that exact allegation, again, you ignored every single thing I said and didn&#39;t address a single point of the content of my post.</p>

<p>Apparently you&#39;re too inept to be able to quote parts of what I say and refuse them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I never presented any theory of any sorts, I stated that 3 white supremacist sites wouldn&#39;t be hosting it if it was pro-Jew.</p>

<p>An actual alternate theory would be that it&#39;s actually just government propaganda designed to make the KKK look bad, and there&#39;s not really much evidence of that at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a PETA website might host videos of how cute cows are, that cute cow video doesn&#39;t necessarily contain PETA propaganda. </p>

<p>But it would most certainly be furthering their agenda in that they want people to see animals as not a food source.</p>

<p>You are not worthy of any form of intellectual debate, if your little four sentence diatribe is all you are able to conjure up.</p>

<p>Why should everything be pro-Jew? Why not neutral, or pro-truth? As far as my other point about something being on a white-supremacist website not necessarily being white-supremacist content, if you really can&#39;t understand that point, I guess I&#39;ll just have to sit here and laugh because it&#39;s not that hard to understand. </p>

<p>Just sit back and read that sentence slowly and maybe the lightbulb will go off. If a white supremacist website hosts a video, it isn&#39;t necessarily white-supremacist content. It might be a video of historical facts that have been suppressed, and the revelation of those facts <strong>just so happens</strong> to further the white-supremacist movement, giving them the motivation to host the content. </p>

<p>Read that a few times and get back to me. </p>

Have you seen with your own eyes a recovered body from one of the mass burial graves? OR - and this is more likely - were you told stories, watched movies, and read books about the Holocaust? Have you ever actually put any real thought into the LOGISTICS of the alleged gas chambers when put into context with the alleged timeline? Seriously, spend some time and think about all of this. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yor7rlFd-yI">Here is some food for thought</a>.</p>

<p>Ask yourself why our schools don&#39;t teach kids about the Holodomor.</p>

<p>Also, ask yourself why Martin Luther and Henry Ford both wrote books that are not-exactly-pro-Jewish people. These were not the type of men who spread false rumors about certain groups of people. Think about it - what benefit is there to speak ill of Jewish people? If you can&#39;t think of a valid reason beyond &quot;to feed their hate mongering minds&quot; then you have a great deal of research to do.</p>

<p>Not at the time of operation, but yes I have visited in person the gas chambers at Dachau.</p>

<p>The schools don&#39;t teach about the holodomor because it wasn&#39;t a systematic purposeful &quot;cleansing&quot; of what the regime dubbed &quot;dirty&quot; people, which was way more than Jews.</p>

<p>Martin Luther king put out not-exactly-pro-Jewish people books because he recognized as a Christian how those certain Jews are wrong, and how they&#39;re probably the same bad Jews in the Illuminati.</p>

<p>Henry Ford was just racist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How many people did Mao and Stalin kill? we never discussed  that in school. just Hitler and his 6 million jews. So they probably murdered less people right? </p>

<p>out of all the ones you listed weren&#39;t they all involving horrible economic conditions? civil unrest, famine? Im sure the leaders feared uprising? Those people were [sadly]murdered out of &#39;mad king&#39; paranoia... Wasn&#39;t Germany like economically stable at the time? Also, hitler seems to be the only one that murdered because of religious orientation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasenovac_concentration_camp">Nazi predations against Serbs</a> don&#39;t receive the attention they should.  And in fact, a hell of a lot of Serbs were murdered at Nazi hands during the war - around 350,000-500,000 so far as I can find.</p>

<p>I suppose a large part of it is that while the Nazis seem to have <em>wanted</em> to murder most of Eastern Europe and Russia (they certainly had plans to), they only succeeded in wiping out a relatively small percentage.  </p>

<p>With the Jews, they managed to kill around 60% of European Jews before the bastards were stopped.</p>

<p>I would say that the fact that many Westerners don&#39;t have a clue about the extent of the Chinese killed during the war isn&#39;t the fault of historians as such.  Western historians generally focus on Western history.</p>

<p>EDIT:  It was actually the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usta%C5%A1e">Ustaše</a> who murdered all those Serbs (and Jews and Gypsies) during WW2 - not Nazi Germany.  The Ustaše <em>were</em> put into power by the Nazis and closely allied both ideologically and diplomatically, however.</p>

<p>The problem, in short, is that the only &quot;evidence&quot; of mass gassings come from the testimony of survivors of the Nazi camps </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much of the Holocaust story is based on eyewitness accounts. Revisionists argue that so-called eyewitness testimony is not always reliable. They give as an example, the John Demjanjuk case. Demjanjuk, a naturalized American autoworker from Eastern Europe, was accused of being Ivan the Terrible, a nefarious concentration camp guard at Treblinka concentration camp who allegedly murdered hundreds of people. </p>

<p>Demjanjuk maintained his innocence, but hundreds of Jewish eyewitnesses testified that he was Ivan. The witnesses screamed, cried, and postured, telling the most incredible stories of cruelty and sadism. They swore under oath that they clearly remembered that Demjanjuk was Ivan. Ultimately, Demjanjuk was deported to Israel, an Israeli court tried and convicted him, primarily on &quot;eye-witnesses&quot; testimony. But new evidence came forward that proved that the Soviet KGB had framed Demjanjuk. Documents that supposedly showed him to be a guard proved to be Soviet forgeries. When faced with a worldwide scandal, even the Israeli Supreme Court had to agree that the eyewitness accounts were not credible and that Demjanjuk was innocent. </p>

I support the right self determination for all people, and I include Palestinians too. Also, do you really think Jews are superior? Ashkenazi Jews are the ones who do important things, and they are a minority in Israel. The average Israeli is a sandnigger, you idiot. The average Israeli looks and talks exactly like one.
Look at this mini documentary that&#39;s 10 minutes long. They LOOK like sandniggers:

<p>I found out that most of my friends don&#39;t like black people, either.  We just don&#39;t talk about it in public.  If we ever do talk about black people in public, we just call them &quot;Canadians&quot;, and it works pretty well.  My brother also did this when he was in the Marines.  He told me that all the white (and Mexican) soldiers would just say &quot;Canadians&quot; when talking about black people so that they wouldn&#39;t know.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t believe that blacks should be exterminated.  I simply believe that they belong in Africa.  Although I have told my friends this, and one of them replied with, &quot;That&#39;s too nice, they should be slaves again&quot;.  So yeah, it&#39;s cool that my friends are racist too!  :)</p>

<p>Also, I was at a party last week, and I was talking to this cool guy who I met there, and I was drunk so I said, &quot;Man, you my nigga&quot;, in which he replied with, &quot;I fucking hate niggers.&quot;.  </p>

<p>University students are often very racist, but they just don&#39;t talk about it out loud.  When people start drinking, casual racism is extremely common.  I even know a fraternity that has a confederate flag in the leader&#39;s room, and my university is not even in the South.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Literally all these holocaust denial talking points have been debunked by historians, scholars, and scientists. And eye-witness testimony does not include just sururvivors of the camps, but also nazi guards. And before you say they were &quot;coerced&quot;, these included nazi&#39;s who were not charged with any crimes as well. And in the 50 years since, not a single nazi witness has come out to say he was tortuted or coerced into testifying. </p>

<p>In regards to the typhus, its not some big secret. Anyone with a cursory understanding of holocaust history is aware of this. It just happens to be overshadowed by the freaking mass extermination of a whole race that happened at the same time, as one was distinctly much worse in terms of scope, size, and sheer maliciousness. </p>

<p>Holocaust deniers are such full of shit. For people who are seeking &quot;the truth&quot;, you sure seem eager to bend the facts to fit your white supremacist narrative.</p>

<p>To quote SS-Rottenführer Oskar Gröning:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would like you to believe me. I saw the gas chambers. I saw the crematoria. I saw the open fires. I was on the ramp when the selections took place. I would like you to believe that these atrocities happened because I was there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for posting you reaction to his bullshit &quot;debunk&quot; links....I looked over them too...one of the links actually pretty much states if you find it and click around enough that a judement was done on a case based on &quot;judicial notice&quot; in regards to gas chambers. According to that dicks own article: &quot;judicial notice meaning that the court treated the gas chambers as common knowledge, and therefore did not require evidence that the gas chambers existed.&quot;</p>

what are you expecting physical evidence to be for these debunking claims? you already don&#39;t believe the gas chambers themselves aren&#39;t physical evidence, so people do things like that cyanide study. do you need pictures of the scientists testing for cyanide? i can&#39;t believe a guy 100% asserting there were no gas chambers based on a couple of narratives gets so many upvotes and a guy saying they existed and giving a wikipedia link with references in it gets downvoted. it is one thing to question historical narratives but it is another to make positive assertions like that and i&#39;m shocked by the ratio of upvotes/downvotes here. here is a link with physical evidence, although i&#39;m thinking that someone who thinks that gas chambers didn&#39;t exist may say this physical evidence was fabricated while anyone who is saying the gas chambers were a myth has the real evidence. convenient. <a href="http://www.shamash.org/holocaust/photos/">http://www.shamash.org/holocaust/photos/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they are links to a Wikipedia article where every single claim is sourced. I confirmed that before I linked them. If you disagree with the what&#39;s said in there, I&#39;d welcome a line by line refutation.</p>

<p>As for the diaries, they are verified. These are confirmed hand-written diary entries of high-up nazi officials. This is Goebbels and Eichmann we&#39;re talking about here. Seperate memoirs of two very prominent nazi&#39;s giving almost identical accounts. I mean, there is zero evidence to suggest they are forged. If intercepted communications or official orders existed, you&#39;d just tell me they&#39;re just unverified &quot;orders&quot;. A physical, hand-written journal entry is not &quot;hearsay&quot;. I don&#39; think you know what that word means</p>

<p>This is why debating a holocaust denier is akin to debating creationist. Nothing can be said to the convince them because any and all evidence you provide is dismissed as &quot;fake&quot; or &quot;forgeries&quot;. Even if I showed you videos Jews getting gassed, you&#39;d tell me it was faked.</p>

<p>Tell me, what is the motive of a nazi who was not getting tried to lie about the holocaust? There simply is none. We have eyewitness testminoy from BOTH sides. </p>

<p>As for more tangible evidence, <a href="http://archive.today/XnCQ">we have confirmed evidence of mass graves</a>]. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/31/nazi-death-camp-treblinka-excavated-archaeologists_n_5062114.html">Here is another source</a></p>

<p>So are forensic archeologists just jewish agents? Lol. </p>

<p>I think the biggest refutation is also one of the simplest: if six million people were not killed, then where did they go? This was a post-census, post-literacy age, we have documents and records that show the presence of the six million in the areas described, and their complete absence after. There is no evidence to suggest any kind of mass migration. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Even orthodox historians no longer hold to the 6 million figure. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would be very much interested to see some citation supporting this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Auschwitz was initially said to be 4 million, and was officially reduced to &quot;1 - 1.5&quot; million in 1989.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That estimate of 4,000,000 was Soviet propaganda, and only accepted by a minority of historians, even in the immediate post-war era.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh wait, where did 2.9 million people go?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 4,000,000 figure was never included in accepted estimates of overall deaths.  Its refutation has been seized upon by deniers as evidence of some shady coverup, when in reality it was never part of the approximation of 6,000,000 dead.  As such, there weren&#39;t &quot;2.9 million people&quot; to remove from the estimates.</p>

<p>Raul Hilberg (whom you mentioned) arrived at his number in <strong><em>1961.</em></strong></p>

<p>Another Holocaust scholar, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Final-Solution-Attempt-Exterminate-1939-1945/dp/0876689519/ref=la_B001KME15C_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1411890415&amp;amp;sr=1-1">Gerald Reitlinger</a> published an estimate of 800,000-900,000 Jews murdered in Auschwitz in <em>1968</em>.</p>

<p>Franciszek Piper, historian for the Auschwitz State Museum, himself in the 1980s <a href="http://en.auschwitz.org/m/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=334&amp;amp;Itemid=8">estimated</a> deaths at Auschwitz at just under 1,100,000.  He arrived at this figure by examining records on the number of Jews deported to the camp, then subtracting out those who were transferred elsewhere, released, liberated, etc.</p>

<p>To be clear, Auschwitz was only the worst of the death camps, but hardly the only place (or method) where Jews and other hated ethnic groups were murdered <em>en masse.</em></p>

<p>Some of the larger actual death camps were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Majdanek (78,000 of whom 61,000 were Jews);</li>
<li>Chelmno (320,000);</li>
<li>Treblinka (762,000);</li>
<li>Sobibor (167,000), and</li>
<li>Belzec (434,000-500,000)</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s between 2,761,000 and 3,327,000 in just those camps alone plus Auschwitz.  Those figures don&#39;t count all the many thousands of smaller camps (not death camps <em>per se</em>, but many Jews were murdered through abuse, overwork and starvation nonetheless), actions by <em>Einsatzgruppen</em> (estimated at 1.5M), etc.</p>

After all, its only a wikipedia article, right? You won&#39;t, because you can&#39;t. Holocaust denial has been thoroughly and utterly debunked, there is undeniable physical evidence from mass graves, eye witness testimony on both sides, verified diary enries by nazi officials, and census information which verifies the sudden disappearance of millions.

    <div class="md"><p>as Ernst Zundel put it during an interview with an Israeli journalist, &quot;<strong>Hitler was an organic outgrowth to Jewish behavior</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>couple of things i&#39;d like to contribute here...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>in the hundreds of tons of German documents captured by the allies, there is not a spec of creditable proof that there was a policy to exterminate the Jews. in fact, the evidence points very strongly to the contrary. this evidence is in the form of eye-witness testimony, scholars, historians, forensics, aerial photographs, the Transfer Agreement (a Nazi/Zionist program to export Jews and their assets to Palestine), court documents, revisionists and many, many other creditable sources, including Jewish sources.</p></li>
<li><p>many see what Hitler did as a unique, when in fact it was not. according to Jewish history, the Jews were kicked out of approximately 80 countries (and persecuted in other ways in as many more) <em>prior</em> to his rise to power. Hitler was supported by approximately 30 countries, many of which sent men to populate the SS.</p></li>
<li><p>the German military consisted of thousands of 1/2 or less Jewish people, some rising to very high ranks. the SS consisted of almost every race and creed of people from all over the world, while people in the U.S. were still lynching African Americans.</p></li>
<li><p>the Jewish people, in my opinion, are victims of this false history perhaps to a greater degree than non-Jews. in Israel Jewish children are essentially taught that the rest of the world hates them -- they are taught to be victims, and so they act as such by vehemently attacking anyone who criticizes their actions and auto-labeling them as anti-Semites. the utterly despicable atrocities committed by Israel against the Arabs in Palestine and elsewhere could not take place without the foundation of the &quot;holocaust&quot;. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>please be careful how you process this information and remember that we are essentially one people upon one earth. in my opinion it is not the fault of the Jewish people as a whole that the lies regarding Hitler and the holocaust continue to permeate our society, but rather the 1%, as we might call them, whose agenda is well served by keeping these lies alive.</p>

<p>education is the problem, not the people</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks bro,</p>

<p>I posted a link to TGSNT over in documentaries, then I posted twice in other subreddits (TGSNT in <a href="/r/documentedtruth">/r/documentedtruth</a>, and a meme about the Streisand effect in <a href="/r/adviceanimals">/r/adviceanimals</a>). None of the submissions are showing up in the new sections of the subreddits.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had stuff get taken down before but only because I accidentally broke a rule about posting or forgot to include something in the title of my post. When that happens though I get a message from a mod from that sub saying why it was taken down and what I need to do to prevent it from getting taken down next time.</p>

<p>Not this time though, there&#39;s nothing. I can still access the posts from my profile, but go to the /new pages and they&#39;re just... not there.</p>

Just watch a few 20 minute epidodes a day and you&#39;ll be done in a week. The positive reviews vastly outweigh the negative ones. In fact, most of the negative ones I&#39;ve read say that they didn&#39;t want to watch the whole thing and only watched two or three episodes. </p>

<p>Edit: Also, the director Dennis Wise will be doing an AMA on <a href="/r/European">/r/European</a> on February 3rd at 7pm, you should check it out to see what others have to say about the film.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Overall a very important and well made documentary.</p>

<p>However based on what think i know happened in the developments of ww2, i take great issue in the way Polish agression towards ethnic germans living in west-poland is portrayed.
Yes the ethnic germans living in poland where being ostracized and harassed to great lenghts. And in many cases for example put in jail for illicit reasons. But there is no record of ethnic germans being <code>slaughtered</code> as in murdered, as this film claims. Even though the wholesale slaughter of german civilians living in poland DID happen as soon as the war began.</p>

<p>Hitler nor the German government did not mention the slaughter of germans as a reason for invasions. However they did say so post-facto in <code>propoganda</code> documents.</p>

<p>There where other reasons given for the German invasion of Poland prior to the fact, whom where in agreement with geneva convention nontheless. Namely the issue of right to passage trough the danzig corridor. And Poland massing it&#39;s troops at the German border, and act of agression and valid reason for a daclaration of war.</p>

<p>(The so-called <code>Gleiwitz incident</code> a supposed false flag operation <code>orchestrated by the nazi</code> is total BS btw the whole thing didn&#39;t even happen no radio tower was attacked by anyone nor did historians find any indications of Nazis/hitler making any public statement of any radio tower was being attacked). Although in the months prior to war, there where frequent skirmishes between german and polish soldiers along the borders.</p>

<p>Then i think there are 2 more <code>mistakes</code> in the documentary.</p>

<p>1: Hitler was the 55th member of the NSDAP, not the 1st nor the 7th. The fact that Hitler lied about being the 1st member is well documented. (i guess nobody is perfect)</p>

<p>2: Hitlers driver was not Jewish. At one point Hitlers driver and Himmler didn&#39;t like each other all that much so himmler though he could get rid of him by making an problem for the fact that this driver was like 1/8th part Jewish. But then Hitler intervened defending his driver. So that&#39;s where the rumour comes from.</p>

<p>All in all, i very much admire this 6 hour documentary and its much more accurate then anything you will see on TV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched a video the other day by Lloyd Pye about how humans are alien hybrids. It had all sorts of nonsense about bigfoot but it was one of the most interesting things I&#39;ve seen in a while. I don&#39;t buy his main theory but I learned a lot. I&#39;ve even watched an anti-American propaganda video produced by North Korea. It&#39;s not like everyone is just a gullible fool that will believe everything they get exposed to and it&#39;s not like every wrong theory is supported by equally wrong facts. There are many facts that are true and of course much exaggeration but there is value in their wrongness, there is metaphorical truth that isn&#39;t literal/material. I remember being a child and being scared of Mein Kampf. Actually scared of the physical book. As an adult I avoided it b/c it&#39;s boring but I learned of its contents and there was nothing scary about words and concepts. </p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming the documentary you&#39;re referring to is &#39;<em>Propaganda</em>&#39;, in which case this documentary was actually made by South Korean film makers. In fact, they did such a good job that the man portrayed as the North Korean historian was apparently detained by the South Korean government for a period of time to verify he wasn&#39;t a spy. If I remember correctly that is. </p>

<p>If your immediate response to this post is knee-jerk vitriol, maybe you should start asking yourself why that is?</p>

<p>Who and what is telling you how to feel about this historical period that you undoubtedly have very little actual knowledge of outside of watching films like Schindler&#39;s List, Downfall and Saving Private Ryan. </p>

<p>Remember that you are in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and the tendency to shut down rational thought in favor of emotion is a trained response. </p>

<p>Also, remember that Adolf Hitler was Time Magazines Person of the Year. How does that sit with your notion that he was the most vile and evil person to ever walk the face of the earth?</p>

<p>Lumping homosexuality in with pedophilia and referring to it as a &quot;degenerate perversion&quot; in an argument against the notion that claiming such isn&#39;t anti-gay is absurd. For starters, homosexuals are as likely to respect consent as heterosexuals; pedophiles categorically cannot if they act on their desires.</p>

<p>What is wrong is showing a lack of respect for the freedom and personal rights of your fellow humans. The sex life of your neighbour should have no bearing upon you unless you are personally involved in their sex life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a group, no. If anything, admiration. At the time of the revolution in 1917 Russia was a corrupt, poverty stricken backwater with little industry and ruled by an evil and corrupt class exploiting everyone else.  In 1917 only 37 percent of males over 7 and 12 percent of females could read. The Soviet Union industrialized, educated its people including granting women equal rights, won WWII, reached 100 percent literacy, sent the first satellite into space, the first man in space, the first woman in space, the first satellite around the moon, got the first pictures of the dark side, which gave them naming rights. It&#39;s been said that what it took the United States 300 years to accomplish, took the Soviet Union thirty. Since the end of communism most people in Russia and the old Soviet republics are worse off.</p>

<p>So no hatred for Russian Soviets. Just sorry they bought the same bill of goods about capitalism that we did. And it has hurt us both.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well as a commie I would hardly be bothered. Still that is a lie. The Soviet Union was busy industrializing, educating its population, and trying to pull the USSR into the 20th century. They didn&#39;t even have much of army until the late thirties when it became clear that Hitler was a danger. The pact Stalin made with Hitler was to give the Soviet Union more time to grow an army. </p>

<p>Are you a rich capitalist that will support any system, no matter how monstrous, that lets you stay rich?</p>

<p>Still this does support my hypothesis that Hitler was used as a pawn by rich capitalists to try to destroy communism and that was the subtext of Nazism and WWII.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Umm... generally contemporary Marxists-Leninists who know their history take major issue with the thesis that Stalinism is commensurate with Communism.</p>

<p>Central planning from the Kremlin doesn&#39;t make a state Communist. The proletariat had literally no power... all dissident Communists, Trotskyists, and Leninists were purged from the ranks. Yes, Stalin industrialised Russia but that was literally on the back of forced labour worked to the bone which was condemned to indeterminate Gulag sentences through kangaroo show trials. The command economy was driven by central planning which was driven by goals of showing off flashy numbers and statistics for propaganda purposes; the command economy was not driven to meet the needs of the people it had total authority over.</p>

<p>The Bolshevik Revolution became compromised by Wall Street and Western Industrialists. That industrialisation was encouraged by the latter because it meant they could sell their technology and capital to the developing technocratic Soviet state. </p>

<p>If you think that Stalinist Russia was closer to Communism than it was to crony capitalism and aristocracy... then you need to reconsider how much propaganda you&#39;ve digested.</p>

<p>So are you a &quot;commie&quot; or a Stalinist? It&#39;s rare to meet educated Communists who apologise for Stalin&#39;s atrocities (let alone whitewashing them as you are... or feigning ignorance) and the Kremlin&#39;s repression of the Eastern Bloc (not to mention its raping of the Eastern Bloc&#39;s natural resources and labour). </p>

<p>Marx would be rolling in his grave at the idea of a &#39;communist/socialist&#39; driven more by hatred of bourgeoisie and dissent (see: demigod powers of Soviet secret police) than it was driven by a humanism based upon the emancipation of human potential.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The official keepers of the Holocaust wage an international campaign to silence the disturbing questions. Most people never even hear the revisionist position because Jewish forces dominate the media and block mainstream access to material that questions Holocaust orthodoxy.</p>

<p>An honest debate between the high priests of the Holocaust and Holocaust questioners would reveal that the latter are not crackpots or hatemongers but people with legitimate questions and arguments based on sound evidence. Such a debate would reveal that revisionists do not deny that Jews, like the Japanese in World War II America, were unjustly incarcerated in concentration camps. Revisionists acknowledge that the conditions in the European camps were horrendous near war&#39;s end, and they maintain that many thousands of Jews died in the camps, mostly from malnutrition and disease. Finally, revisionists also freely admit that some massacres of innocent civilians took place and that such horrors should be condemned. </p>

<p>Revisionists maintain that while there were certainly Germans who committed what is today defined as &quot;war crimes,&quot; the Allies themselves, which include the Soviets, were guilty of them to at least an equal degree. Revisionists point to the Allied intentional firebombing of civilian populations as well as to the Soviets&#39; mass rape, expulsion, and murder of millions of Germans and other peoples of Eastern Europe. They also point out that many of the deaths in the concentration camps in the last years of the war were caused by Allied bombing of rail lines vital for transportation of food and medicines. They point out that specific targeting and destruction of pharmaceutical factories that produced medicines and medical supplies increased the death rate among German civilians, soldiers and also among those in the camps. </p>

<p>To challenge the popular perception of the Holocaust, obviously, does not condone mass murder. Those who refute the popular conception of the Holocaust make clear that they view atrocities against innocent Jews or any other people as crimes against the moral values of Western civilization. Revisionists simply contend that the Jews were not the only victims of the world&#39;s most horrific war. Many revisionists also argue that the motive for a horrific Holocaust story is the furtherance of the economic and political objectives of Israel and the Jewish organizations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some estimates of those killed and the disposal of bodies, 
From From <em>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</em> (1960) by William L. Shirer. His information was taken from Nuremberg trials or direct testimony. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>To superintend the new camp and the supply of slave labor for I. G. Farben there arrived at Auschwitz in the spring of 1940 a gang of the most choice ruffians in the S.S., among them Josef Kramer, who would later become known to the British public as the ”Beast of Belsen,” and Rudolf Franz Hoess, a convicted murderer who had served five years in prison – he spent most of his adult life as first a convict and then a jailer – and who in 1946, at the age of forty-six, would boast at Nuremberg that at Auschwitz he had superintended the extermination of two and a half million persons, not counting another half million who had been allowed to ”succumb to starvation.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Letters showing businesses competing for death camp contracts. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A letter from the firm dated February 12, 1943, gives the tenor.</p>

<p>TO THE CENTRAL CONSTRUCTION OFFICE OF THE S.S. AND POLICE, AUSCHWITZ: SUBJECT: Crematoria 2 and 3 for the camp.</p>

<p>We acknowledge receipt of your order for five triple furnaces, including two electric elevators for raising the corpses and one emergency elevator. A practical installation for stoking coal was also ordered and one for transporting ashes.</p>

<p>The correspondence of two other firms engaged in the crematorium business popped up at the Nuremberg trials. The disposal of the corpses at a number of Nazi camps had attracted commercial competition. One of the oldest German companies in the field offered its drawings for crematoria to be built at a large S.S. camp in Belgrade.</p>

<p>For putting the bodies into the furnace, we suggest simply a metal fork moving on cylinders.</p>

<p>Each furnace will have an oven measuring only 24 by 18 inches, as coffins will not be used. For transporting the corpses from the storage points to the furnaces we suggest using light carts on wheels, and we enclose diagrams of these drawn to scale.”1209</p>

<p>Another firm, C. H. Kori, also sought the Belgrade business, emphasizing its great experience in this field since it had already constructed four furnaces for Dachau and five for Lublin, which, it said, had given ”full satisfaction in practice.”</p>

<p>Following our verbal discussion regarding the delivery of equipment of simple construction for the burning of bodies, we are submitting plans for our perfected cremation ovens which operate with coal and which have hitherto given full satisfaction.</p>

<p>We suggest two crematoria furnaces for the building planned, but we advise you to make further inquiries to make sure that two ovens will be sufficient for your requirements.</p>

<p>We guarantee the effectiveness of the cremation ovens as well as their durability, the use of the best material and our faultless workmanship.</p>

<p>Awaiting your further word, we will be at your service.</p>

<p>Heil Hitler!
C. H. KORI, G.M.B.H.1210</p>

<p>In the end even the strenuous efforts of German free enterprise, using the best material and providing faultless workmanship, proved inadequate for burning the corpses. The well-constructed crematoria fell far behind at a number of camps but especially at Auschwitz in 1944 when as many as 6,000 bodies (Hoess put it at as many as 3 6,000) had to be burned daily. For instance, in forty-six days during the summer of 1944 between 250,000 and 300,000 Hungarian Jews alone were done to death at this camp. Even the gas chambers fell behind and resort was made to mass shootings in the Einsatzkommando style. The bodies were simply thrown into ditches and burned, many of them only partly, and then earth was bulldozed over them. The camp commanders complained toward the end that the crematoria had proved not only inadequate but ”uneconomical.” page 972</p>

<p>How many hapless innocent people – mostly Jews but including a fairly large number of others, especially Russian prisoners of war – were slaughtered at the one camp of Auschwitz? The exact number will never be known. Hoess himself in his affidavit gave an estimate of ”2,500,000 victims executed and exterminated by gassing and burning, and at least another half million who succumbed to starvation and disease, making a total of about 3,000,000.” Later at his own trial in Warsaw he reduced the figure to 1,135,000. The Soviet government, which investigated the camp after it was overrun by the Red Army in January 1945, put the figure at four million. Reitlinger, on the basis of his own exhaustive study, doubts that the number gassed at Auschwitz was ”even as high as three quarters of a million.” He estimates that about 600,000 died in the gas chambers, to which he adds ”the unknown proportion” of some 300,000 or more ”missing,” who were shot or who died of starvation and disease. By any estimate the figure is considerable. Page 973</p>

<p>But the ghetto population did not die fast enough from starvation and disease to suit Himmler, who in the summer of 1942 ordered the Jews in the Warsaw ghetto to be removed altogether ”for security reasons.” On July 22 a great ”resettlement” action was instituted. Between then and October 3 a total of 310,322 Jews, according to Stroop, were ”resettled.” That is, they were transported to the extermination camps, most of them to Treblinka, where they were gassed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Continued, with more info about the disposal of bodies:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be%C5%82%C5%BCec_extermination_camp">Bełżec</a> The camp was situated in German-occupied Poland … and operated from 17 March 1942 to the end of December 1942. The burning of exhumed corpses on five open-air grids and bone crushing continued until March 1943.</p>

<p>From late 1997 until early 1998, a thorough archaeological survey of the site was conducted. The survey was headed by Andrzej Kola, director of the Underwater Archaeological Department at the University of Toruń, and Mieczysław Góra, senior curator of the Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology in Łódź. The team identified the railway sidings and remains of a number of buildings. They also found 33 mass graves, the largest of which were 210 by 60 feet. The team estimated that they had found 15,000 unburned bodies, and &quot;The largest mass graves ... contained unburned human remains (parts and pieces of skulls with hair and skin attached) and entire bodies preserved in wax-fat transformation. The foul smelling bottom layer of the graves consisted of several inches to a meter thick of human fat resembling black soap. One grave contained uncrushed human bones so closely packed that the drill could not penetrate.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treblinka_extermination_camp">Treblinka extermination camp</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A different group of about 300 men, called the Totenjuden (&quot;Jews of death&quot;), lived and worked in Camp 3 across from the gas chambers. During the first six months they took the corpses away for burial after any gold teeth had been extracted. However, once cremation began in early 1943 they took the corpses to the pits, refuelled the pyres, crushed the remaining bones with mallets, and collected the ashes for disposal.[40] Each trainload of &quot;deportees&quot; brought to Treblinka consisted of an average of sixty heavily guarded railcars. They were divided into three sets of twenty at the layover yard. Each set was processed within the first two hours of backing onto the ramp, and was then made ready by the Sonderkommandos to be exchanged for the next set of twenty cars.</p>

<p>The secret orders to exhume the corpses already buried at Treblinka and burn them instead came directly from the Nazi leadership, quite possibly from Heinrich Himmler himself. Himmler was very concerned about covering up Nazi crimes, and it is known that the cremations began shortly after his visit to the camp in late February or early March 1943.</p>

<p>Within Treblinka II, there were at least two large cremation pits constructed to incinerate dead bodies. The pits were used to cremate the new corpses along with the old corpses, which had to be dug up since they had been buried with a crawler excavator during the first six months of the camp&#39;s operation. They utilised rails as grates per the instructions of Herbert Floß, the camp&#39;s cremation expert. The bodies were placed on grates over wood, splashed with petrol, and burned in one massive blaze. It was a harrowing sight, according to Jankiel Wiernik, with the bellies of pregnant women exploding from boiling amniotic sac fluid.[105] He wrote that &quot;the heat radiating from the pits was maddening.&quot;[5] The bodies would burn for five hours, and the pyres operated 24 hours a day. Once the system had been perfected, the bodies of some 10,000–12,000 victims could be incinerated there at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.deathcamps.org/occupation/janowska.html">Janowska</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The open-air burn pits were located east of the new gas chambers and refuelled from 4 a.m.[106] (or after 5 a.m. depending on work-load) to 6 p.m. in roughly 5-hour intervals.[107] The current camp memorial includes a flat grave marker resembling one of them. It is constructed from melted basalt and has a concrete foundation. It is a symbolic grave, as the Nazis spread the actual human ashes, mixed with sand, over 22,000 square metres (237,000 square feet).</p>

<p>In June 1943, the 126 man Jewish brigade of Sonderkommando 1005 began the exhumation and cremation of all those who had been murdered and buried in the Lviv District. The German officers in charge of and supervising this Kommando were Sipo-SD Scharführer Rauch and Sipo-SD Oberwachtmeister Kepick. The bodies recovered from the pits were laid on special platforms in stacks, each containing 1,200-1,600 corpses. Tar and petrol were poured over the bodies which were then burned. The ashes and bones were sifted in order to collect articles of value - gold fillings, teeth, rings, watches etc. Eyewitness accounts testify that during the five months’ activity of this &quot;Death Kommando&quot; 110 kilogrammes of gold were sifted out of the ashes and dispatched to Germany. The ashes were scattered on the fields or buried; large bones were collected separately and crushed in a bone-crusher, which was specially designed to speed up the &quot;work&quot;. The bone-crusher supervisor was Sipo-SD Scharführer Elitko. The Germans failed to destroy this bone-crusher, which was later recovered by the Soviets and used as material evidence in war crimes trials in the Soviet Union.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So while there were crematoria at some concentration camps it was more common just the bury the victims in pits, though they tended to give off such a stench that later prisoners were forced to dig them up, crush the bones and rebury them. It’s not like they had a shortage of victims to do the work. Burying the bodies in great pits was more common than the crematoria, which could handle fewer bodies than a big pit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even a well-respected Jewish historian who believes in the existence of the gas chambers offers a somewhat revisionist viewpoint. In his 1988 book &quot;Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?: The &quot;Final Solution&quot; in History&quot;, Princeton University professor Arno J. Mayer pointed out that there are many questions about the Holocaust. Mayer, who himself lost close family in the Holocaust, wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many questions remain open.... All in all, how many bodies were cremated in Auschwitz? How many died there all told? What was the national, religious, and ethnic breakdown in this commonwealth of victims? How many of them were condemned to die a &quot;natural&quot; death and how many were deliberately slaughtered... ? We have simply no answers to these questions at this time. (pg. 366) </p>

<p>From 1942 to 1945, certainly at Auschwitz, but probably overall, more Jews were killed by so-called &quot;natural&quot; causes than by &quot;unnatural&quot; ones. (pg. 365) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The truth is that if hundreds of thousands rather than up to 26 million were killed, and if most of those deaths were caused by the expected brutalities of war rather than a calculated plan of extermination, then 
the prevalent version of the Holocaust story is grossly inaccurate. </p>

<p>The main component of the Holocaust story is that the Nazis had a plan or program for exterminating the Jews. But even though the Allies captured Germany&#39;s government and military headquarters and most of the concentration camps with their records intact, there has never been a single order or instruction found that calls for the gassing of Jews or that indicates a plan to exterminate all of European Jewry. No blueprint has been found for the construction of a human gas chamber, or instructions or orders written for gassing human beings. </p>

<p>On this subject, as on others, the Holocaust story has undergone revision. No longer do the experts claim the Nazis gave direct orders to exterminate the Jews. Raul Hilberg in the 1961, first edition of his major work on the Holocaust, The Destruction of the European Jews, wrote that in 1941 Hitler had issued two orders for the extermination of the Jews. In Hilberg&#39;s revised three-volume edition of the book, published in 1985, all reference to such orders had been removed.</p>

<p>Hilberg, R. (1961). The Destruction of the European Jews. New York: Harper &amp; Row. </p>

<p>In a review of Hilberg&#39;s revised edition, historian Christopher Browning, himself an &quot;exterminationist 
historian,&quot; wrote: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the new edition, all references in the text to a Hitler decision or Hitler order for the &quot;Final Solution&quot; 
have been systematically excised. Buried at the bottom of a single footnote stands the solitary reference: 
&quot;Chronology and circumstances point to a Hitler decision before the summer ended.&quot; In the new edition, 
decisions were not made and orders were not given.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some answers to this white washing of Hitler and the Nazi. </p>

<p>From <em>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</em> (1960) by William L. Shirer. His information was taken from Nuremberg trials or direct testimony. </p>

<p>First, what motivated Hitler&#39;s actions and his view of himself and how he should act:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In Hitler’s utterances there runs the theme that the supreme leader is above
the morals of ordinary man. Hegel and Nietzsche thought so too. We have
seen Hegel’s argument that ”the private virtues” and ”irrelevant moral claims” must not stand in the way of the great rulers, nor must one be squeamish if the heroes, in fulfilling their destiny, trample or ”crush to pieces” many an innocent flower. Nietzsche, with his grotesque exaggeration, goes much further.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The strong men, the masters, regain the pure conscience of a beast of prey; monsters filled with joy, they can return from a fearful succession of murder, arson, rape and torture with the same joy in their hearts, the same contentment in their souls as if they had indulged in some student’s rag . . . When a man is capable of commanding, when he is by nature a ”Master,” when he is violent
in act and gesture, of what importance are treaties to him? . . . To judge morality properly, it must be replaced by two concepts borrowed from zoology: the taming of a beast and the breeding of a specific species. Page 111</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Monsters filled with joy, good description of Hitler and the Nazis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Came to the bottom of the comments to see this. It immediately made me wonder why the hell this was stickied. Are people actively trying to discredit rational conspiracy theorists and correlate them with Nazi apologists and violent radicalization? Because this is how it&#39;s done.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a problem with an objective look at touchy subjects like this. But from where I&#39;m at in the film, this documentary isn&#39;t really objective at all, it&#39;s just flat out pro-Nazi. Any form of statist socialism is bad, imo, and the film&#39;s reference to Hitler as the German Messiah was ridiculous. (And it goes without saying that the comments on the film&#39;s website are laughable)</p>

<p>It&#39;s just like any other shitty subjective agenda-pushing documentary that gets churned out these days; it&#39;s only distinguishing factor is that it takes an unusual position.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll come back to edit the comment when I finish the documentary. If I can fucking stomach it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, kind of like that. I know you&#39;re implying that I&#39;m being a hypocrite in criticizing this documentary and <em>not</em> criticizing the emotional warfare wrapped in propaganda wrapped in marketable genocide that passes for most documentaries about the Holocaust, but I&#39;m going to let it slide.</p>

<p>Though, like I said, I didn&#39;t finish watching it. Just a pet peeve of mine when political leaders, fascist or socialist or otherwise, are lauded. So the documentary&#39;s portrayal of the Nazzie prison camps and resultant mass death, or the social policies and racism/eugenics that came before it could be right on the money. I doubt it, but I&#39;ll have to finish watching it when I&#39;m in the mood for emotionally leading documentaries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sticky is obviously JIDF type mods trying to associate conspiracy with neo-nazis/anti-semitism. </p>

<p>I do believe that the motives of the Nazis is completely white-washed, twisted to suit propaganda purposes for Israel and that history has been re-written. There is no way of learning the scope of how many jews and other minorities were killed. I have a feeling it was much less than 6 million. Numerous times that number had been settled and then inflated again and again, which is suspicious. Of course the holocaust was horrible but to get a huge PR impact you need some unimaginable horror. You ask any kid in school about WW2 and every kid says it was started because Hitler hated Jews and wanted racial purity (which in itself was not a huge motivator for Germany to go to war)...you never learn why anti-semitism was such an easy sell to the German public. You never learn about how Jewish owned banks really stuck the screws to the German economy post WWI and you never learn about the failed revolution in Germany led by Jewish Communists right after WWI. This documentary is very shoddy though and in my point of view is on the anti-semite side rather than just rational perception of what actually occurred back then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bub, you should be able to entertain the idea that this documentary is propaganda that pushes a very specific notion. If you can&#39;t realize that, then you aren&#39;t as critical of a thinker as you try to be.</p>

<p>I accept that there&#39;s many, many aspects of WWII that are open to more thorough investigation. But I&#39;m also aware that this documentary has a definite agenda. Does this mean that I reject all of the information? No, I&#39;m just highly skeptical of what&#39;s being said, as we all should be with everything we watch or read.</p>

<p>But that picture of hitler in the sidebar? That&#39;s some edgy teenager shit, it&#39;s cringeworthy. It doesn&#39;t hurt my feelings, it just makes me think the people here are less civil than I thought.</p>

<p>Holocaust deniers believe the historical narrative is extremely exaggerated. They don&#39;t dispute that Jews were grossly mistreated or that many of them died. They do dispute whether the Nazis had an extermination program and the existence of gas chambers.</p>

<p>Everyone thinks they know all about the Holocaust and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/r4EbYAH.jpg">gas chambers</a>. But it turns out most are extremely ignorant about the subject. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/GcrrplG.jpg">But aren&#39;t the survivors reliable?</a> No, not on certain issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, I feel like this posts is very controversial and as a result we have lot of people that seem to think if you question the status quo you are automatically a neo-nazi and you hate all Jews or something. Quite the contrary, this information (which I have not finished reviewing) is very difficult for me to process and goes contrary to my upbringing in many ways. However, it syncs up with a lot I know about the banking cartels that are attempting to run the world through zionistic (Rothschilds and other FED founders) agendas. There are a lot of things here that if reliable sources can be found to suggest they are truth would suggest that what I was taught growing up in school may not exactly be what happened. </p>

<p>I think &quot;history&quot; is only written from the perspective of the victors and unfortunetly the truth is likely somewhere in the middle with a lot of people blind to the truth or deceived into believing certain truths from a very early point. It&#39;s brainwashing. I want to know what really happened. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s not black and white, the only way to move forward honestly is knowing the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a strange feeling when find yourself conceding the truth in ideas you once thought were outrageous and stupid.</p>

<p>But the fact is, most people know effectively <em>nothing</em> about the holocaust—much less the controversies. I&#39;ve only been studying these issues in detail for about a year and I&#39;m still scratching the surface. It&#39;s a massive topic.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say with certainty what happened in the holocaust but I am highly skeptical of the story we&#39;ve been told.</p>

<p>More stuff I posted somewhere else:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a copy of <a href="http://i.imgur.com/NdIJP5d.jpg"><em>The Black Book: the Nazi Crime Against the Jewish People</em></a>, published in 1946 by the Jewish Black Book Committee, &quot;which was made up of the World Jewish Congress based in New York, the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee in Moscow, the Va‘ad Le’umi (Jewish National Council) in Jerusalem, and the American Committee of Jewish Writers, Artists, and Scientists.&quot;</p>

<p>Albert Einstein <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=oA3HituGJXQC&amp;amp;pg=PA164&amp;amp;dq=%22Albert+Einstein+had+written+a+preface%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=BywhU77gNOuk0gHeiIE4&amp;amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22Albert%20Einstein%20had%20written%20a%20preface%22&amp;amp;f=false">even wrote a preface</a> calling for Palestine to be opened for Jewish settlement but it was omitted from publication.</p>

<p>Anyway here is the good stuff:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/bcLWWyi.png">Description of extermination methods in Treblinka</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/yW7ek3R.png">Extermination at Belzec</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/sqyyAGR.png">The Bathhouse at Sobibur</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/U5nUBgf.png">Rivers of Jewish blood, and a game German&#39;s played</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing that no one talks about the steam chambers, electrocution apparatuses or the suffocation chambers any more. Nowadays, all we hear about is gas chambers. </p>

<p>Amazingly, on page 4, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/9zN8xFN.png"><em>The Black Book</em> gets the precise figure of Jewish deaths exactly right</a>: 6 Million. Pretty good for 1946.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally. Of course, those passages I excerpted above are no longer part of the &#39;orthodox history.&#39; But the source, The Black Book, was submitted to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_War_Crimes_Commission">United Nations War Crimes Commission</a> and continues to be cited by Holocaust scholars. </p>

<p>That documentary is great. There are two new Treblinka documentaries that are a must see. <em>The Jewish Gas Chamber Hoax</em> and <a href="http://www.gaschamberhoax.com"><em>The Treblinka Archaeology Hoax</em></a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The older I get, the more I see how truth turns to gossip which then transforms into larger than life stories and outright lies! The propaganda of WWII transformed the Germans into demons and everyone else into saints and heroes. </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny how this propaganda machine works so well in each and every scenerio within our government and media structures these days. </p>

<p>Propaganda works so well that if it&#39;s constantly applied, it only strengthens the thought. For instance...dictate, teach or malice something that might be considered a bad controversy in public about Jews in this day and age and see what happens! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a question for anyone who knows more about this subject. </p>

<p>If you are aware of the world&#39;s history of financial power (as discussed in Money Masters) you&#39;ll understand that this documentary paints Adolph Hitler as possibly the world&#39;s greatest revolutionary, someone who rose up and fought against the international political / money power structure. He attempted to take back the value of his people&#39;s money by having the government produce it rather than lend it&#39;s value to usury as is done in most of the world.</p>

<p>This was pre-war Germany, but as the war begins we hear stories about Wall Street and other large banking interests providing funds to support the effort. This shows an obvious conflict of interest, and is contradictory to the idea that he was opposed to TPTB at all.</p>

<p>Was he a Revolutionary rebel, or just another tool of those who guide international affairs?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So another puppet, not a revolutionary. (Revolutionary is probably how he was portrayed to the German people, but not the actual case)</p>

<p>In that case, the premise of the documentary is flawed. It has however given me some new perspectives that were certainly not taught in school.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That makes a lot of sense.

    <div class="md"><p>The theory of Hitler receiving funds from Wall st. came from two book sources. One was debunked completely. The other was by Anthony Sutton who claimed Hitler was funded by Bush and others. What he forgets to mention is that some banks with money to make continued to deal with Germany as good Capitalist do. After all not all the banks were Jewish. Some like Henry Ford hated Communism and the Jews and did not want to see a communist take over of Germany. He sent Hitler $50,000 every birthday. All this of course was in peacetime. Sutton also wrote another book claiming the Jewish bankers never funded the Russian Revolution, which we know to be true. Lastly, Hitler never had any need to get money from the bankers as he was protecting one of the richest organisations in the world. The Vatican.</p>

It is absolutely amazing to me how many of you come to this sub for thoughts outside the mainstream and an alternative to what has been taught, a place to think, and always can&#39;t seem to grasp the thought that much of the history you know is not the full truth.  There is always two sides to the coin.  Do I think the Nazis were fun loving, bunny petting, and rainbow shitting people. No. But for the most part this documentary is not that far off the path of what I could figure actually was happening.  The Allies clearly hated everything the Nazis stood for and each side had their own propaganda as in every situation but you can&#39;t deny the possibility that what we know of the holocaust may be over exaggerated.  Do I think the Nazis mistreated the Jews, most definitely, but I also think that the holocaust has turned into a Martyr to end all martyrs.  Those are my thoughts anyway</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t make my point very clear and I think you read between the lines to a certain extent. </p>

<p>I will say history is written by the winners of conflict that alter the affairs of man. The narrative of the genocide of the American Indians is lacking in appropriate brutality. It is always implied that there was some desire to serve civilization or some modern interpretation of &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot;.</p>

<p>When it comes to WWII to simply paint the defeated powers as monsters  could be misleading. The complexities of WWI must be fully grasped to understand WWII. Was Japan forced into a corner ? Probably. Is the American Empire of today more aggressive than the powers considered at the outset of WWII ? These are questions that beg to be answered.</p>

<p>What color shoes did Hitler wear ? He has been painted as a homosexual - he has been &quot;documented&quot; as impotent. Here it seems he is straight. I am simply interested in facts. If he was a nice guy and if he had a great sense of humor I think it should be part of the record.  </p>

<p>I kind of want to agree, but you said &quot;should not only be concerned in offering information&quot;. I think that you and I will agree that the more information we have the better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough if that is all you really want to know. I would like to know if he really thought he was doing the best thing for Europe at that time. A good comparison that I keep referencing is the genocide of the American Indians. It seems that General Custard thought participating in the genocide was the right thing to do. We tend to sympathize with is dedication to his duties of his rank. There have been countless movies made about him in a positive light. But as an American Indian one would not be interested in a man who contributed to the genocide of his civilization. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In fact MOST serial killers would be described as charming individuals. It is part of the narcissistic psychopathy. Psychopaths feel no natural empathy for any living creature, but themselves. Early on the smart ones realize that if other people are going to trust and accept them, they must become masters at faking it. Because of that, you would probably never  know without years of interaction, if you were dealing with one. Hitler&#39;s indifference to the humanity of jews, along with charismatic qualities, fit most of the qualifications for psychopathy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To the holocaust revisionists on here that have clearly done more research on the subject than I, would you please explain the quotes that the Wikipedia page on criticism of Holocaust denial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Holocaust_denial#cite_note-9">here</a> </p>

<p>It contains alleged quotes from Hitler such as &quot;Once I really am in power, my first and foremost task will be the annihilation of the Jews. As soon as I have the power to do so, I will have gallows built in rows—at the Marienplatz in Munich, for example—as many as traffic allows. Then the Jews will be hanged indiscriminately, and they will remain hanging until they stink; they will hang there as long as the principles of hygiene permit. As soon as they have been untied, the next batch will be strung up, and so on down the line, until the last Jew in Munich has been exterminated. Other cities will follow suit, precisely in this fashion, until all Germany has been completely cleansed of Jews&quot;</p>

<p>This and many other quotes on the page very clearly implicate Hitler but obviously they could be falsified. I&#39;m really interested in this subject now as quite frankly I had always been incredibly turned off by it, but now after seeing stuff like the &quot;Auschwitz-bucks&quot; and the cultural testimonial of those inside, etc, well, I just want to hear both sides of the story, see the evidence and make up my own mind. But these quotes if legitimate are damning, obviously. </p>

<p>I think what really gets to me, above all, is the illegalization of holocaust denial. After watching this, it really hit home that if this is a law, you cannot say that free speech exists. I understand laws against hate speech are valid (*edit - laws against speech that directly incites VIOLENCE aganist an individual or group) and that we cannot allow free speech that openly calls for violence against an individual or an ethnic group, however questioning history is clearly not this, it is merely raising questions. Imagine if questioning 9-11 was a criminal offense, punishable by PRISON! Well, I&#39;m sure there are many who would want exactly that, media pundits calling 911 truth advocates &quot;ungodly&quot; and &quot;immoral&quot; and &quot;hateful&quot; come distinctly to mind. </p>

<p>The whole thing is disgusting, Zionism is disgusting, that is undisputed, and we know the aims of Zionism existed pre-WW2, that is for sure. Now look at modern days, the constantyly duplicitious nature of Israel and it&#39;s portrayal of the Palestinians, and more egregiously it&#39;s ability to on the one hand cry about the holocaust, and on the other hand <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/01/times-of-israel-genocide-article-post-deleted_n_5641971.html">openly calls for genocide in mainstream news op-eds</a> . </p>

<p>In closing I would say I am the better for having watched this film, thank you for posting it. We must question everything and not tolerate any forms of thought censorship whatsoever. </p>

<p>If you <a href="http://www.ifz-muenchen.de/archiv/zs/zs-0640.pdf">dig up the document</a>, you find that ZS 640 is dated 1955; the text was written in 1945, and the source was Josef Hell&#39;s notes from 1922. Josef Hell was a reporter for the anti-Hitler newspaper &quot;<a href="http://i.imgur.com/QKdT4ZS.jpg">Der gerade Weg</a>.&quot; So it&#39;s not the most reliable source.

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. The quote seemed obscene to me even reading it, even if you suppose Hitler did have plans for an extermination, openly announcing it to the world so bluntly, he was too intelligent of a politician for that.</p>

<p>This is really my first exposure to all this kind of thing, and it&#39;s opening my eyes quite a bit. Growing up, I&#39;ve always thought &quot;my god, what kind of world would we live in if the Nazi&#39;s won?&quot; Now I feel like an idiot for not even considering the alternate timelines. I&#39;m not surprised anymore by worldwide suppression and see no evil attitudes since it is pervasise across medical science, archaeology, history, current geopolitics, it&#39;s like most of what is perpetuated is lies and no one has the guts or balls to actually point it out rather than the ever growing alternative media. </p>

<p>Needless to say, this is easily one of the biggest lies we have been told if it is a lie, and one of the most terrible. But there are so many terrible lies... It&#39;s disheartening! We live in Game of Thrones. I hope the light of truth of world history comes to shine across the entire earth, whatever it  may be.

    <div class="md"><p>Ironically, Adolf Hitler coined the term &quot;Big Lie&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods. It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation. For the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying. </p>

<p>Imagine if questioning 9-11 was a criminal offense, punishable by PRISON! Well, I&#39;m sure there are many who would want exactly that, media pundits calling 911 truth advocates &quot;ungodly&quot; and &quot;immoral&quot; and &quot;hateful&quot; come distinctly to mind. </p>

<p>UK PM Cameron recently gave a speech labelling questioning 911 as &quot;extremism&quot; and <em>attempted</em> to equate it with terrorism....</p>

<p>A power hungry man who was pure evil and wanted to own Europe for himself, starting with Poland and working his way around. Britain had to intervene because of the atrocities of his ethnic cleansing that he was convicting - also thank God the US came to our aid.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for bring this to my attention, I have shared it abundantly and continue to research topics in history that are written by the winners.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, this is a complete lie, Germans in Poland lived peacefully. Actual reasons for Hitler&#39;s move against Poland were quite different - the Polish leadership at the time didn&#39;t want to join Germany in an alliance to guarantee Hitler&#39;s safety to deal with France and then jointly attack the Soviets. Hitler was actually the first pro-Polish German politician - he tried to forge friendly relations with Poland. It is very interesting that marshal Pilsudski - Poland&#39;s dictator at the time of Hitler&#39;s assent to power - was the first leader to reach out to Hitler through an emissary inquiring what his intentions will be once ruler of Germany long before he became the chancellor. Hitler then attended Pilsudski&#39;s funeral mass in Berlin (which is his last documented visit in a church btw). If you analyze Hitler&#39;s speeches and policies in 1936-38 they were actually aimed at trying to forge an alliance with Poland - toning down nationalist rhetoric in Danzing, organizing festivals of Polish culture in Germany and vice-versa etc. Poland even backed Germany during the Czechoslovakian crisis. But then Polish leadership was vowed away from this course by French and esp. British diplomatic maneuvers, empty &quot;guarantees&quot; etc. This is when in the early 1939 Hitler got mad at Poland and turned to Stalin. </p>

I had to stop when it started roll crediting every shitty law in America. I thought this was about Hitler.

<p>Here&#39;s some rinse for that brainwash <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwgQVZju1ZM">Jim Al-Khalili - Quantum Life: How Physics Can Revolutionise Biology</a> </p>

<p>EDITS: Yes its factual, however its tone is so wrong. We do still live in a &quot;pick sides&quot; era, as we did then. Socialism, Fascism, Communism, and democracy are all divisive ideologies unless followed through. Communism failed, Democracy is failing, Socialism was violently achieved in America due to capitalist opposition. Fasci...zzzzzzzzz</p>

<p>Just describing these primitive ideologies hurts. But until we get a New World Order,  Fuck Russia, fuck ISIS. Its 2014 and I still need to scream fuck Hitler? He was fucking nuts and enabled genocide. <a href="https://kiltsandmore.com/upload/artikelbilder/big/C23.jpg">Ne Obliviscaris</a> </p>

<p>A couple of days ago someone using a throwaway account posted this to a subreddit which I frequently visit. It was downvoted to hell and back and ridiculed as usual. </p>

<p>I&#39;m certainly glad I watched it. Pretty much was glued to the screen for the entire 6.5 hour duration. Probably the best documentary I&#39;ve ever watched, hands down, and I&#39;ve seen quite a few &#39;truth&#39; ones.</p>

<p>There&#39;s so much to digest here. I probably will watch this again in the near future. Thanks guys for getting this out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone gonna talk about the odd amounts of positive reviews for this?  I get it if you like a different point of view, but several are claiming that it&#39;s the &quot;best documentary ever made&quot;, which really is a laughable assertion given the lack of any proprietary material, most of it is recutting of a Hitler biopic. This seems far to much to be a film that (independent of what the film might say) is being pushed by some group (Stormfront?) as their view on the past. </p>

<p>Also as for the films &quot;objectivity&quot;, I have to say that using the common holllywood tactic of swelling chords to cause emotional reaction, around images of Nazi rallies is not the way to show impartiality, either for or against. </p>

<p>I&#39;m watching, but I&#39;m extremely tentative, as hess factors are making it difficult for me to see this as anything more than propaganda. There is definitely truth that Hitler is not taught in schools as anything but the embodiment of evil, and the actual details of his rise are usually hidden, but this does not mean it is the opposite of what we have been told.</p>

<p>So I&#39;ve now gotten at least 3 down votes, and not a single response. Come on people, discussion is key.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at IMDB. That&#39;s where I&#39;m getting the reviews.</p>

<p>sorry if it seemed perfunctory, but I always go and check outside sources on any piece like this, making sure to filter my opinion through the evidence I could see. I was mainly expecting to see this film trashed and berated as propaganda not worth the time to see. Upon searching I instead found quite a lot of reviews giving it sentiments similar to &quot;best documentary&quot;, with fewer than I would think coming down on it as propaganda. Another reason is that the general quality of the film is, well, terrible. You can like the points made if you want, but calling it the best is suspicious by any count.</p>

Also the whole malnourished jews in deathcamps that you see pictures of was at the end of the war when Allies bombed all the supply routes, including the ones to the concentration camps. </p>

<p>And don&#39;t forget, Hitler got his idea of concentration camps from Stalin himself, though he didn&#39; make them as grueling as Stalin&#39;s gulags. So if you want to condemn deathcamps, condemn Stalin&#39;s work.</p>

<p>The mistreatment of jews wasn&#39;t a result of no supplies. they were trying to kill off the jews, as evidenced by the poison gas chambers that were discovered, and testimonial of the jews that were liberated by the Allies. </p>

<p>And of course Stalin was no better. i suppose we talk more about Hitler because he tried to get rid of not just one people in Europe, but also gypsies, gays, the mentally disabled, and anyone labeled as an undesirable. Stalin put people in gulags for going against the government.</p>

<p>Also, Hitler&#39;s crimes weren&#39;t very well known until the concentration camps were actually discovered. the gulags weren&#39;t known much about either until the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. in that time, the holocaust became a household word, but when the gulags were discovered, there harsh reality had happened during stalin&#39;s reign, which ended 40 years before the USSR&#39;s downfall, wasn&#39;t as shocking.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you ask what have the Germans done to the Jews you must always ask what have the Jews done to the Germans. Since 1850 they have done three things which are really dramatic.</p>

<p>Number 1, they were a small minority of two percent of the population, at the time when Hitler came to power 500 000 within 60 million German people. This small minority managed to control about 50 percent of the media of about 70 percent of all judges to have a tremendous amount of influence in movie, theater and in literature they were over represented.</p>

<p>Second, Jews were at the origin of a lot of catastrophic financial bank crashes in Germany between 1870 and 1920. Millions of German fathers have lost their income their savings because of these Jewish gangsters, bank gangsters and speculation people.</p>

<p>The third point which was psychologically the most dangerous of all. They have introduced into German art and culture and theater and movie decadence in morality. The first homosexual theater plays were made in Berlin in the 1920&#39;s the first adultery theater plays were made in the 1880&#39;s, 1890&#39;s by Jewish authors. Adultery and sexual perversions of all sort, sadism, masochism, a lot of homosexuality all these things and then the decadent art, you know. An art which is absolutely ridiculous so called &quot;modern art&quot; it was all pushed by Jewish intellectuals. And this created among the German people a big revolt and there were furious reactions in Germany and this is why Adolf Hitler came to power.&quot;</p>

<p>Now ask yourself whether this isn&#39;t happening in America now and perhaps the wider world? The banking world is largely a Jewish one, the porn industry was legalized by the court case of one Jew. It doesn&#39;t stop at merely legalization as expounded upon here (i.e they basically control porn too). The entertainment industry is completely monopolized by the Jews. And now the pushing of the homosexual lifestyle (again largely by the Jews) which was at first the odd man out, on a whole population, whether you agree with it or not. When the state legalized homosexual marriage they effectively normalized it to the country. What will follow in the future is an erosion of clear gender roles and boundaries. Children will no longer grow up with the default heterosexual lifestyle as the first choice, they will be indoctrinated to believe that homosexuality is as normal as heterosexuality.</p>

<p>In the words of some of the leading homosexual writers and proponents of the time (excerpt from savethemales.ca, my emphesis):</p>

<p>&quot;Heterosexual hegemony is being eroded,&quot; says Gary kinsman. &quot;The forms of sexuality considered natural have been socially created (really? cause I thought nature kinda did that on its own...) and can be socially transformed (apparently so..).&quot; (The Regulation of Desire: Sexuality in Canada, 1987, p.219)</p>

<p>&quot;In a free society, everyone will be gay,&quot; says Allen Young, a pioneer of the Gay Liberation Movement. (John D&#39;Emilio, Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America, p.322) &quot;</p>

<p>Unlike us, gays understand that their campaign for &quot;equal rights&quot; will erase the distinction between gay and straight. In the words of gay historian Jonathan Katz.</p>

<p>&quot;In one sense the right is right...to accuse the gay and lesbian rights movement of threatening homogenization....if gay and lesbian liberationists ever achieve full equality, they will do away with the social need for the hetero/homo division. The secret of the most moderate, mainstream gay and lesbian civil rights movement is its radically transformative promise (or threat, depending on your values). The Invention of Heterosexuality, 1995, p.188.&quot;</p>

<p>John Blair Linn has been an active member of the Washington DC gay scene for 25 years. Recently he became disillusioned with the &quot;homosexual lifestyle.</p>

<p>&quot;Homosexuality revolves totally around sex, pure and simple. Few homosexual men ever form relationships, and nearly all homosexual men are attracted to much younger men. Homosexuality is truly a compulsive disorder.&quot;﻿</p>

<p>The &quot;liberal&quot; mindset in America is going to destroy it completely, when the family unit is destroyed through the indoctrination of unnatural behavior as natural, the whole nation soon follows. Porn too is destroying the social fabric of our society as it teaches young boys to view woman as objects of pleasure. It teaches them to have sex with a lot of woman instead of staying with one and being faithful to one woman. The divorce rates will only keep skyrocketing as younger and younger children get to see their idols on all media act in a way that is purely materialistic and fundamentally empty. Good family values have disappeared from television and slowly replaced with degeneration. Miley Cyrus is just the latest in perversion, they&#39;v been doing this for years. People aren&#39;t ready yet for Miley Cyrus style degeneration, but soon they will be, and people who look down upon this will be laughed at by the younger generation as being old farts.</p>

<p>It&#39;s &quot;cool&quot; to be promiscuous, &quot;people aren&#39;t made to be with one partner&quot;, &quot;you must be sexually free!&quot;, &quot;preference is truth, if you want something it must be good&quot;. I had a conversation with a young adult male where he would equate visiting prostitutes with normal activities such as bowling, or going to the cinema to watch a movie. This is how many males perceive sex, a purely materialistic act devoid of soul, devoid of contact, simply the rubbing of ones penis against the inner walls of any woman who opens her legs. The pure induldgence of the material flesh, without any regard to the spiritual person. This is why sex becomes increasingly dehumanizing, violent and destructive. As one physical act looses its novelty there will be an immediate search to satiate this material desire by doing ever more extreme and evil acts, Chris Hedges even goes as far as to say that pornography is at heart necrophilia. In both instances sex is devoid of spiritual contact between two people and reduced to pure materialism. The male mentality today is one of the reasons I have very few male friends. Because they are degenerates who have infantile minds, these people are void and proud of it.</p>

<pre><code>All of this in my eyes is Satanic.
</code></pre>

<p>A little extra something specifically about homosexuality and how it ceased to be seen as disorder, which until that point there seemed to have been no question that it was.</p>

<p>According to the American Psychiatric Association, until 1974 homosexuality was a mental illness. Freud had alluded to homosexuality numerous times in his writings, and had concluded that paranoia and homosexuality were inseparable. Other psychiatrists wrote copiously on the subject, and homosexuality was “treated” on a wide basis. There was little or no suggestion within the psychiatric community that homosexuality might be conceptualized as anything other than a mental illness that needed to be treated. And, of course, homosexuality was listed as a mental illness in DSM-II.</p>

<p>Then in 1970 gay activists protested against the APA convention in San Francisco. These scenes were repeated in 1971, and as people came out of the “closet” and felt empowered politically and socially, the APA directorate became increasingly uncomfortable with their stance. In 1973 the APA’s nomenclature task force recommended that homosexuality be declared normal. The trustees were not prepared to go that far, but they did vote to remove homosexuality from the list of mental illnesses by a vote of 13 to 0, with 2 abstentions. This decision was confirmed by a vote of the APA membership, and homosexuality was no longer listed in the seventh edition of DSM-II, which was issued in 1974.</p>

<p>Also noteworthy is the fact that the vote of the membership was by no means unanimous. Only about 55% of the members who voted favored the change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. I agree with you, the present American culture has been debased and perverted by the Jewish control over the media and the legal system. What we are living under is as disgusting and verminous as what the Romans endured (and wallowed in) under the Caesars.

<p>I think everyone should look at every single war and think &quot;History is written by the victors&quot;, including WW2. However, just because this is the case, doesn&#39;t mean that we should now make the losers look like the good guys all along. There is a middle ground and this documentary... i&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s totally fair. I will give it a watch though</p>

<p>A lot of the footage in this movie came from the movie Hitler: Rise of Evil.  So I watched some of both, for perspective.</p>

<p>That movie shows him wailing away on a puppy and generally acting batshit crazy in the first 15 min.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, documentary is a joke and praises Hitler. </p>

<p>After 30 min i found at least few facts about him which they deliberately avoided for example they said after Hitler became ruler of Reich he fought with unemployment <strong>but they didn&#39;t mentioned Hitler did this by  throwing people to concentration camps (Forced labor camp) and forcing people to work at artificial jobs which he created.</strong></p>

<p>I lost faith in this reddit, also godlikeproductions, youtube conspiracy theoretics and just people. How can you believe anything without checking sources? I suppose glorifying music while they talk about Hitler is convincing enough to believe everything  :&lt;</p>

1. I am insane. (You are then sentenced to an asylum.)
2. Yes I denied the Holocaust, please be lenient. 
People have been imprisoned for up to 5 years. Even the lawyers are hard to find, as one was jailed for 3 years for defending a client.
The judge stated. &quot; The truth is no defence.&quot; Some people have even been deported from other countries to stand trial in Germany or Israel. 
All that I have written is 100% true. Now take YOUR BS argument and do some research before commenting on something you have no idea about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haven&#39;t watched but I can assume its a &quot;Hitler wasn&#39;t really all that bad considering the situation at the time&quot; type of doc, not exactly pro-national socialism but still focusing on Hitler being portrayed as taking desperate measures during desperate times. </p>

<p>Its true Hitler was a product of the treaty of Versailles and its unmeetable demands in relation to reparations Germany would pay the &#39;entente cordiale&#39;.
Its true German hyperinflation, unemployment and poverty led to the radicalization of the masses, most notably in the form of the spartacists and Nazis. Its also true that Hitler rejuvenated his country&#39;s economy by adhering to Nazism. </p>

<p>This does not change the fact that he was a vile, racist, xenophobic, homophobic, despotic anti-semite hell bent on creating a master race devoid if anyone that wasn&#39;t of  &#39;Germanic&#39; blood.</p>

<p><em>That&#39;s just bat shit crazy. He was a fuckin fruitloop. Nothing will change by redefining why Hitler did what he did. Read mein Kampf, you&#39;ll see what I mean. He says some really interesting and thought provoking things, and then starts rabbiting on about how Jews are smelly.</em></p>

<p>Fuck off Hitler. That&#39;s just fucking warped.</p>

Let&#39;s put the holocaust aside, let&#39;s put his hatred of Jews aside.  He was a totalitarian tyrant... And for anyone, especially you guys to support that is insane. Praising an overlord while criticizing your own that doesnt even close to match up is laughable at best. </p>

<p>Yet another lie propogated by the Jewish mind benders and kosher clowns like Alex Jones:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately for those who would like to link Hitler and the National Socialists with gun control, the entire premise for such an effort is false. German firearms legislation under Hitler, far from banning private ownership, actually facilitated the keeping and bearing of arms by German citizens by eliminating or ameliorating restrictive laws which had been enacted by the government preceding his: a left-center government which had contained a number of Jews.</p>

-The Nazis (thinking only of the well being of the Jews) decided the best way to rid the camp sites of disease,   was to burn the bodies of the dead Jews.<br/>
-Unfortunately, when the evil allied forces showed up, they saw what &quot;appeared to be death camps.&quot;  This couldn&#39;t have been further from the truth.  Many of the Nazi&#39;s who were really trying to help the Jews, wanted to stick around and make sure the jews got better, and had to flee because the allies had a terrible plan to make the Nazis look bad.  This plan was hatched in Israel, which had not yet been formed, but nonetheless, was ruthless in exterminating the Nazis.<br/>
-Saddened by not being able to help the Jews, and the rest of Europe, Hitler sat by by bed and decided to clean his hand gun, and it accidentally went off, grazing him in the back of the skull.  He staggered forward to his loving wife Eva, but was unable to speak so he showed her where he was shot by pointing the revolver down her throat forgetting about her gag reflex.  (Rarely did he have any reason to see her gag reflex after all.)  she gagged, and the gun went off and grazed her in the the back of the skull.<br/>
They both staggered out of the room and out the back door where  a couple of friends were having a bonfire.  The Hitlers, not noticing, stumbled into the fire, and were badly burnt and died.
-So, by the end of the war, Hitler and the Nazis were just a bunch of mis-understood humanitarians, trying to help a bunch of jews who loved to be outdoors, but didn&#39;t understand the dangers of back woods camping.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hitler was probably the hero of the second world war and the 21st century. A man of ethical courage, a man of spiritual perception and good intent. A spiritual soul who cared – cared about all life forms, all cultures, about goodness and Light and ultimately about Truth.</p>

<p>Because he was one of the good guys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing I didn&#39;t learn in my history class.  I really wish this documentary wasn&#39;t so padded with war scenes and fond music behind videos of Hitler along with videos from other movies.</p>

<p>I waded through hours of this documentary, waiting for the inevitable punch this whole documentary tries to deliver that the holocaust was somehow fabricated/exaggerated.  Many war crimes were committed in WWII and history is written by the victors.  You could have made this point easily without treading into such a controversial topic.</p>

<p>I can only imagine the people who composed this documentary only think of Adolf Hitler with the rosy music so often paired with his appearances in the film.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t help but laugh my ass off at their speculations on &#39;What if Germany Had Won?&#39;  Utopia lost?  And then they have the balls to paint homosexuality as some sort of awful sin that wouldn&#39;t have propagated in a German state.  Wow, I lost all respect for whatever they had to say there.</p>

<p>Not a bad documentary.  I do feel Germany is far more demonized in WWII then they deserve and not many people know the true history of WWI and WWII.  In true <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> form this was a bankers war, but do we always have to equate bankers=jews?  I think this is where truthers lose a lot of respect.</p>

<p>Oh btw, hoe about the genocide the jews in israel are executing. I agree we cant forget genocides but please let us focus on the current ones, not one 70 years in the past from which you jews are still surfing the guilt wave. Its over. You are just normal people.

    <div class="md"><p>So I just watched the whole 6 hours in one sitting.  It was an interesting documentary that gave a different view point on the war, but it was obvious that there was a very strong bias present throughout the film.  I like to give all pieces of information a fare share, and I have to say I am not impressed.  Throughout the film the director constantly tries to shift blame on the war and the multitude of the atrocities on the various allied forces.  And while some of the blame is warranted, its a is a very narrow view on the whole subject at hand.  There were in-numerous variables that contributed to the war.  Germany was definitely not the victim of circumstance.  The German people had no right to think they could get away without a scratch after the shit they pulled after WWI.  Yes they were fucked by everyone after the world war I, and they rightly deserved it for failing (you don&#39;t get a cookie for losing a war), I am surprised that Germany was not devied up between the victors in the first place as the spoils of war.  What the hell did they expect from the rest of the world?  Clemency after WWI, are they deft?  Also the whole denial of holocaust is ridiculous.  There are many eye witness accounts, pictures, and videos that show clearly the horrors committed by the Nazi Soldiers at the camps.  Shifting blame and saying that Russia or the British had committed just as horrible crimes does not dismiss your crimes.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>More or less, they did. It could have been resolved peacefully had Germany wanted it to. Instead, Germany was eager for war, since it had roflstomped France in the Franco-Prussian war fairly recently. </p>

<p>They gave unilateral backing to Austria-Hungary to give it&#39;s ridiculous demands to Serbia, and to invade if they didn&#39;t accept, knowing very well that it would draw Russia, and France into the war <em>when</em> Serbia didn&#39;t accept (the demands were made to be rejected so Austria-Hungary would have a better reason for war). They rebuffed all British and Russian attempts at seeking a diplomatic resolution to the July Crisis.</p>

<p>The only reason Austria-Hungary acted so boldly is because they knew they could count on Germany backing them no matter what. The war was manufactured out of crisis that could have easily been resolved peacefully. </p>

Denying that the holocaust happened by stating something else happened before it does not refute the fact that the holocaust did happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well as a commie I would hardly be bothered. Still that is a lie. The Soviet Union was busy industrializing, educating its population, and trying to pull the USSR into the 20th century. They didn&#39;t even have much of army until the late thirties when it became clear that Hitler was a danger. The pact Stalin made with Hitler was to give the Soviet Union more time to grow an army. </p>

<p>Are you a rich capitalist that will support any system, no matter how monstrous, that lets you stay rich?</p>

<p>Still this does support my hypothesis that Hitler was used as a pawn by rich capitalists to try to destroy communism and that was the subtext of Nazism and WWII.</p>

<p>Well, at least you are honest enough to admit it.  I&#39;ll give you some respect for that.  Not much, but some.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If your reading comprehension was up to par you are the one who disagrees with this fantastic documentary just for the sake of disagreeing.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you articulate what is wrong and why exactly its wrong captain?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lol.  You&#39;re a poor grammar Nazi.  Too funny!</p>

<p>If your writing abilities were up to par, I wouldn&#39;t have to guess at wtf you are saying here.  Are you asking a question, making a statement, or trying to insult me?  If you&#39;re attempting to insult me, fuck you.  If you are making a statement, try rewording it&#39;s a bit confusing.  If you are asking why I disagree with this documentary?  Well, other than the conclusion of: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hitler was probably the hero of the second world war and the 21st century. A man of ethical courage, a man of spiritual perception and good intent. A spiritual soul who cared – cared about all life forms, all cultures, about goodness and Light and ultimately about Truth.</p>

<p>Because he was one of the good guys.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I 100% disagree.  Any person that resorts to torture, murder, and manipulation of the masses is NOT one of the good guys.</p>

<p>I would have to say this video conveniently downplays events of significant importance.  Like the Reichstag fire, or the overthrow of a Democracy to a Dictatorship, just to name a couple.  It mentioned these topics, but then conflates other events to make it seem as though they were needed, appropriate, and beneficial to German society.  I disagree.  I think these events degraded German culture, and opened the door for this (your) perverse ideology to spread.</p>

<p>As a Voluntaryist/Libertarian we share very little common political/social/spiritual ground.  Which is fine by me.</p>

<p>Now, just to be clear, I am NOT saying that history depicts the true image of Hitler and the events surrounding the World Wars.  Quite the contrary.  But neither does this video.</p>

<p>Now, if you are done insulting my reading comprehension?  Might I suggest you brush up on just who is guiding your movement?  I&#39;ll post a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kyu6CPlEx0Q">video</a>, just in case those words are too hard to comprehend.</p>

<p>But the fact is, most people know effectively <em>nothing</em> about the holocaust—much less the controversies. I&#39;ve only been studying these issues in detail for about a year and I&#39;m still scratching the surface. It&#39;s a massive topic.</p>

<p>Albert Einstein <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=oA3HituGJXQC&amp;amp;pg=PA164&amp;amp;dq=%22Albert+Einstein+had+written+a+preface%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=BywhU77gNOuk0gHeiIE4&amp;amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22Albert%20Einstein%20had%20written%20a%20preface%22&amp;amp;f=false">even wrote a preface</a> calling for Palestine to be opened for Jewish settlement but it was omitted from publication.</p>

<p>Anyway here is the good stuff:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/bcLWWyi.png">Description of extermination methods in Treblinka</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/yW7ek3R.png">Extermination at Belzec</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/sqyyAGR.png">The Bathhouse at Sobibur</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/U5nUBgf.png">Rivers of Jewish blood, and a game German&#39;s played</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing that no one talks about the steam chambers, electrocution apparatuses or the suffocation chambers any more. Nowadays, all we hear about is gas chambers. </p>

<p>Amazingly, on page 4, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/9zN8xFN.png"><em>The Black Book</em> gets the precise figure of Jewish deaths exactly right</a>: 6 Million. Pretty good for 1946.</p>

<p>We come from different sub species of humanoids. </p>

<p>In case you&#39;re wondering why they still eat each other and live in the stone age. </p>

<p>&quot;Enriching the lives of people who move out of the slums to a less violent, more abundant society&quot;</p>

<p>Colonialism is evil, but multiculturalism is not? Gotta love that marxist hypocrisy. Why would we want them to bring their hell here&gt; </p>

<p>Indians are asiatics that migrated here. Ice Age Europeans were here before them (See Kennewick Man)</p>

<p>&quot;Dude that shit has been around for ages.&quot;</p>

<p>Not here, did you miss the point? </p>

<p>Why did you cross out white? It was almost ALL white children abused by Pakistani muslim child service workers. A predictable failure of &quot;multiculturalism&quot; . </p>

<p>You still haven&#39;t explained what is so great that makes up for the seemingly endless list of detriment.</p>

<p>Sorry I didn&#39;t browse through six months of your posting history? Wait no I&#39;m not, because that&#39;s stupid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough if that is all you really want to know. I would like to know if he really thought he was doing the best thing for Europe at that time. A good comparison that I keep referencing is the genocide of the American Indians. It seems that General Custard thought participating in the genocide was the right thing to do. We tend to sympathize with is dedication to his duties of his rank. There have been countless movies made about him in a positive light. But as an American Indian one would not be interested in a man who contributed to the genocide of his civilization. </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t think you see the connection. Perhaps you feel the the 100 years or so that set these events apart make them somehow - I don&#39;t know what.   </p>
