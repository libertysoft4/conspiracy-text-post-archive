<p>&quot;Most music worldwide has been tuned to 440 hertz since the International Standards Organization (ISO) endorsed it in 1953. The recent rediscoveries of the vibratory / oscillatory nature of the universe indicate that this contemporary <em>international concert pitch standard may generate an unhealthy effect or anti-social behavior in the consciousness of human beings</em>. </p>

<p>A=432 Hz, known as Verdi’s ‘A’ is an alternative tuning that is mathematically consistent with the universe. <em>Music based on 432 Hz transmits beneficial healing energy, because it is a pure tone of math fundamental to nature.</em> </p>

<p>There is a theory that the change from 432 Hz to 440 Hz was dictated by Nazi propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels. He used it to make people think and feel a certain manner, and to make them a prisoner of a certain consciousness. </p>

<p>Then around 1940 the United States introduced 440 Hz worldwide, and finally in 1953 it became the ISO 16-standard.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>a friend and i had a jam session using the pythagorean tuning.  theres such a slight difference, imo, that is doesnt warrant any type of conspiracy theory.  chords <em>did</em> sound more harmonic, but that was about it.  8 hz really is nothing.  the mathematics behind the tuning is what is interesting, as theyre based on a type of universal harmony.</p>

<p>id recommend looking into the golden ratio/square/rectangle if this is something that piques ur interest.  that is something truly amazing and really shows up in ancient greek (and later roman) art fairly often.</p>

<p>e2a:  just to note, all my digital tuners wouldnt go below 436hz.  i had to bust out my dads old 70s needle-gauge tuner to drop down to 432.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think depression and disharmony are so widespread.  That 8 Hz is massive! when taken in to account.  They use it against us.  IndIndependent labels should release on a432 and market it as such.  Let the consumers decide.  Possibly put the trash Zionist labels out of business.   With the correlation to shape, sound, color, light, a few degrees off is diaasterius to the final product.  This is purposefully done.  There is no VALID reason to do this.</p>

<p>If you think it&#39;s so harmless, go YouTube some of your favorite hits at a432 and tell me you can&#39;t innately sense the disharmony.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who has spent countless years as a musician and studying music theory and analysis, this honestly has to be the dumbest thing I have ever heard. 440Hz is a central point of modern concert pitch tuning. The &#39;A&#39; is selected as this point because all orchestral stringed instruments have an &#39;A&#39; string. It&#39;s just a standard of the modern age. If you go and listen to a Baroque orchestra they will often tune to and &#39;A&#39; of 415Hz and even use special &#39;period style&#39; Baroque bows for their instruments to try an replicate the style of the time. Sure different resonant pitches have different qualities but attempting to claim the pitch standard was implemented for use as a Nazi mind control conspiracy? Yeah.... and the choice of 33, 45 and 78 rpm for records is a reptilian conspiracy...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not having a dig at you, just the person who wrote the article you linked to. It sounds like they&#39;ve done research into the effects of resonant frequencies and wavelengths which certainly do have different properties and effects on matter and can influence state of mind, just like an atonal rhythm can (like a marching beat on a snare drum). The stupidity here is not that different frequencies can cause an effect in people, but the attempt to attribute it to malevolence and intentional subjugation of others. It&#39;s just changes in pitch standard over time in history and adaptation of tuning to create a commonality across all instruments, even non orchestral ones such as guitar etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>changing the pitch of the source sample isn&#39;t going to be the same as tuning instruments to A432. the resonant characteristics of a lower pitch don&#39;t just appear magically out of nowhere through a digital filter. also pitching vocals is stupid. the source must be tuned to 432 or you&#39;re wasting your time.</p>

And <a href="http://528records.com/pages/432-vs-528-honest-debate-or-cia-propaganda-fraud">maybe A432 is misinformation</a>. Or maybe <a href="http://www.dailypaul.com/271324/retune-your-music-to-a444-hz-or-a432">either A432 or A444 are good</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is so ridiculous.</p>

<p>The real difference is the difference between equal temperament and using the natural harmonic series - whatever the starting pitch is. Equal temperament - whatever the starting pitch is - results in intervals that aren&#39;t quite the same as the natural harmonic overtone series. The flawed reasoning of the article is just convoluting starting pitch for that <em>real</em> issue…that isn&#39;t much of an issue at all, since in nature, notes of all frequencies occur, not just half steps.</p>
