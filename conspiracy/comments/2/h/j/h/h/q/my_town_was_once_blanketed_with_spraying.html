    <div class="md"><p>Haha definitely not the end of it. Probably just a change in cycles. We&#39;re having waay above normal temps for this time of year, and rain in the forecast for the next few days. My guess is that they conjured up this humid storm, 
 Something to do with winter. My guess is after the storm it&#39;ll be a full out assault on our ionosphere</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perform your own when they are spraying chemicals.  In the interim, I&#39;ll scan my results.  The best evidence is what you seek for yourself.  Validate or invalidate my results with your own.  A simple sterilized dish and roughgly $100 will net up u your own.
