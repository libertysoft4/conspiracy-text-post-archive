    <div class="md"><p>The sumerian stories say that the anunnaki wanted our gold. If that is so then why is there still so much gold on earth? </p>

<p>Honestly I&#39;ve always found the gold connection to the big problem with the annunaki or nephilim stories. It seems to me there is only one creature obsessed with gold and that is man. Man is also a creature capable of great and massive deceptions. Especially when it comes to people who are less literate in the sciences. </p>

<p>More like anything that has value, or perceived to have value, can be monetized.</p>

<p>Gold has a unique combination of properties that make it stand out such as rarity, portability, chemical stability, malleability and is easily identified.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have never really understood the value of gold. I guess it is a pretty metal and it has a comforting feel. </p>

<p>I realize it has technological and perhaps even health effects. Colloidal gold and silver are supposed to be wonder drugs according to some. But I don&#39;t have totally satisfactory data on that. Not enough to believe it.</p>

<p>With that said though I think the beautiful and reflectiveness of gold certainly lends itself to sun worship regalia. I imagine a man all decked out in gold standing in the sun before a crowd could be quite a spectacle. </p>

<p>But I don&#39;t really KNOW, why gold. What I do know though is that if the annunaki wanted it they sure left a lot of it behind.</p>

<p>Well no... If you keep reading those guys pretty much wiped out all life on earth. Enlil decided that the many voices of man got on his nerves and bang, flood.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind these Annunaki created us to be their slaves, again according to the story. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that ethics concerned them very much if they even existed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, good points. Maybe invoking an argument in ethics wasnt the strongest idea.. but ill still try:</p>

<p>Per the theories, Anu was the king of the annunaki. His two sons, enlil and enki, essentially ruled the earth. Enlil had the upper world (mesopotamia) while enki had the underworld (africa, particularily south africa.)</p>

<p>Anu never really made it to earth, as far as my research indicates.</p>

<p>Anyhow, their mission was to extract enough gold to repair their own world. Not to invade or colonize. When the annunaki got fed up with the hard work, they asked their scientist and geneticist, Enki, to help them out. So, enki spliced an indigenous creature with their genes to create a slave race (Adamu, or humans). This took awhile, amd they failed several times. But nonetheless, they finally created humans.</p>

<p>Humans were supposed to he purely slaves, to toil the mines for the annunaki. This gave rise to our obsession with gold, as it was the &quot;rock of the gods&quot; or whatever.</p>

<p>Enki was much more passionate towards his creation than his brother, enlil. Enlil was a great leader, bit viewed the adamu as purely slaves, and as a potential threat due to their much less lifespans (manufactured) and subsequential birth rates. He feared that, should they learn the ways of the annunaki (science, technology, etc) that they wouod be able to outnumber and eventually overpower the annunaki. So he forbade the humans to have these knowledges.</p>

<p>Anyhow, long story short, enki taught the humans because he loved the humans, enlik was enraged, and feared for the annunakis position of power. The annunaki knew a coming disaster (comet/asteroid strike) was imminent, and enlil decreed that all humans should be allowed to perish. When the floods subside, enlil wanted everything to restart from scratch and continue on.</p>

<p>Enki decided to save a few humans, one of which was zuisudra (the sumerian Noah). </p>

<p>As it turned out, the floods wiped out <em>every</em>thing, akd decimated the lands so kuch thst the annunaki were not able to restart their mission on their own. They just didnt have enough manpower to even feed themselves. They were facing certain death.</p>

<p>But then, they realized that few humans survived, and nurtured the human population enough to sustain the annunaki and their mission.</p>

<p>Once they finally had their gold, they left earth for the humans and went back home.</p>

<p>Of course, all this according to theories and shit. But still, the ethics argument is valid, in this scenario. Again, this is assuming the theories to be true and stuff...</p>

<p>I think here is where your theory breaks down. Not to be combatative but if these Niberans were so smart then why on earth would they use an asteroid strike and hurt their own people? Risk their own mission to save their home planet?  Seems it could have been done many ways without risking the whole operation. Or better yet, just finish the job and then wipe out mankind.</p>

<p>Another problem here though is that more and more Stitchin&#39;s scholarship is coming into question. I have never come across one single scrap of information outside of Stitchin that talks about the Annunaki needed gold to repair their world. I&#39;m really not even sure how he leapt to that conclusion but it&#39;s not on the stone tablets.</p>

<p>I think that a lot of leaps are being made here on very scant data.  There is nothing wrong with speculation but speculation alone cannot bring us the truth. I guess while we are on the subject who is to say that alien ethics have to be anything like our own? </p>

<p>Also while we are on this subject too something else bugs me about Stitchin&#39;s work. He describes this Annunaki as very technologically advanced. They had earth splitting lasers and shit. Also weren&#39;t they giants? So... How could it have been easier to have tiny little man do the mining vs 40 foot tall mf&#39;s with mighty high technology? It doesn&#39;t track for me. It especially doesn&#39;t track that they didn&#39;t use machines. Especially if they were in a hurry. To genetically engineer and train a whole slave race???</p>

<p>See I have another theory about all of this. I think that an advanced earth civilization came upon the primitive Sumerians and masqueraded as their gods. Much like the Cargo Cults of WWII.  But in this case they told a lot of tall tales and exploited the labor of more primitive peoples. This theory doesn&#39;t explain the giant bones though. Damn I wish I could see that with my own eyes. Just once.</p>

<p>Ftr, i dont consider you combative at all. But, have you considered the possibility thst despite their intelligence and advanced technology, that they <em>couldnt</em> manipulate asteroids out of harms way? Maybe they were advanced enough to know well in advance that there was a strike coming, and they were fully capable of avoiding catastrophe themselves, yet chose to let the humans be subjected to such an event?</p>

<p>Though, your other points, you poke the same holes that bother me with sitchins work as well. Although i love his shit, there are definite issues that should not be overlooked. I believe you touched upon quite a few of them.</p>

<p>Holy shit. Yes. I have come to the same exact conclusion, actually. I admittedly am incredibky fascinated with aliens, but i feel the more plausible explanation for all these ufo and megalith mysteries is simply what you just posited. Some older, terrestrially originated civilization survived whatever the fuck happened at the end of the last ice age and seized the opportunity to take advantage of the sumerians and other ancient folks (who, i would argue, would be descendants of the survivors, but were seperated and thus suffered from an amnesiac heritage of epic proportions).</p>

<p>The giants, well. Yea. I dunno. I feel that they kind of reside on the &quot;hominid&quot; side of this discussion. Hominids dont have to be sasquatch, there couldve been another, bigger, version of humans that might have succumbed to the racism and bigotry that we see today. As you said before, humans <em>are</em> wicked.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no question about some kind of major global &quot;event&quot; around 10k years or so. That geologists call it the younger dryas and it definitely happened. Whatever it actually was.</p>

<p>True... but 40 feet tall in their largest incarnation? Some of the bones that I&#39;ve read about belong to beings 20-30 feet tall. They had weird shit like double rows of teeth and an extra finger. I did spend a few moments considering the idea of a predator race of hominids. Especially considering a lot of the legends about these guys is that they ate us. </p>

<p>Another thing that occurred to me is that idea of  island gigantism <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_gigantism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_gigantism</a>. I got this idea from the Odyssey and how he encounters and island of one eyed giants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m constantly telling myself there has to be a better way. Visiting forums like this one does a pretty darn good job of highlighting the problems with the world but rarely is a focus on the solution. We need a think-tank style subreddit focussed on the workings of a near-perfect society. Things like the banking and political systems need massive change but change to what? I think political parties need to be abandoned, interest free loans should be issued by the sate and patents should be rendered obsolete. Why put our resources into several different companies competing to achieve the same goal. We know sales are correlated primarily to marketing not quality. Capitalism doesn&#39;t favour the &quot;best&quot; product, if favours the product that sells the most. Each industry could be controlled by one company with an independent group assessing quality of product. If Each were constantly striving for innovation and had access to pooled resources surely the products would be better. </p>

<p>I&#39;m constantly telling myself there has to be a better way. Visiting forums like this one does a pretty darn good job of highlighting the problems with the world but rarely is a focus on the solution. We need a think-tank style subreddit focussed on the workings of a near-perfect society. Things like the banking and political systems need massive change but change to what? I think political parties need to be abandoned, interest free loans should be issued by the sate and patents should be rendered obsolete. Why put our resources into several different companies competing to achieve the same goal. We know sales are correlated primarily to marketing not quality. Capitalism doesn&#39;t favour the &quot;best&quot; product, if favours the product that sells the most. Each industry could be controlled by one company with an independent group assessing quality of product. If Each were constantly striving for innovation and had access to pooled resources surely the products would be better.</p>

<p>Oh man I&#39;ve been on this road all my life. I&#39;ve gone one step farther though. I realized that nobody wants change. Change is scary. The unknown is scary. And most people have been on earth long enough to know that making plans and working hard doesn&#39;t always turn out like it is supposed to.</p>

<p>It would. It truly would. People are the wealth of the world. With enough people working together anything could happen. But I don&#39;t think we going to get to change society. I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s quite happy like it is or it is at least afraid of being something else.</p>

<p>I think to progress we are going to have to leave the fearful behind. We can build the community we want anywhere. We just need the set up costs covered and enough people onboard to ensure that the process isn&#39;t total misery for all concerned.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been said for years by the wise men that the world would have to end one day. But they say it always starts up again too. It&#39;s an idea common to a lot of ancient religions. I think we will have to live through the death of this world and when it is gone we can build a new one.</p>

I&#39;m pretty close to believing myself that the end times are near and honestly I&#39;d welcome welcome it. However waiting for the sky to fall obviously isn&#39;t any way to live, in the mean time I&#39;m planning on creating my own party. Going pretty slow for a while offering a slightly better version of the current system, but the current system none the less. Then when and if any public interest/following arises and only after the party is in the game so to speak would I just start dropping bombs. Full pr campaign about the actual issues that exist and offer real solutions, slap the people awake to the corrupt system we&#39;re being forced to live in. I wouldn&#39;t even care if I were laughed out of politics at that point at least people would have had the chance to be part of something better. If it fails backup is find the people that agree and start an isolated self sustaining community. Australia is the place to do it, we have a rural population that is dying for such a thing to occur. No one likes or trusts the government and our parliament is small enough for a complete overhaul. We just need ONE person to get the ball rolling and if it has to be me it will be. </p>

<p>why is there still so much gold on earth?</p>

<p>Most of earths gold is believed to be in the core, not on top at the surface, while it is believed that the majority of gold discovered at the surface originated from meteorites and comets that have struck the earth in the distant path. </p>

<p>While it is currently thought that gold mining began as far back as 6-7k yrs ago, there is evidence that gold mining on earth has been a thing for hundreds of thousands of years:</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure it discredits them either but I find the gold thing to be a very big gaping hole in the theory.</p>

<p>Also I was aware of the data from the Adam&#39;s calender site and the various sites all over Africa. </p>

<p>I was actually pretty fascinated with this. It&#39;s Michael Tellinger giving a talk on the subject.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD1h9DYitg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcD1h9DYitg</a></p>

<p>But... with all this said I think leaping to the conclusion of aliens is still a huge leap with not enough data to fuel it. Especially not in the face of the idea that various types of hominid have existed for millions of year. I&#39;m of the school that doesn&#39;t believe homo habilis was a trog with no brains. My study of this matter has lead me to conclude that our original speech comes from the habilis times and so do the seeds of our earliest legends.</p>

<p>When I think about it, I can&#39;t get passed the idea that 2000 years ago people were riding around on carts powered by oxen. Even 500 years ago such contraptions would not be out of plus. But pretty much from the dawn of the industrial revolution until now there has been an explosion in population and technology. </p>

<p>I think these two things go hand in hand. The more people you have and the better your infrastructure the faster and farther your technology can advance per generation. It strikes me that technological advancement is an inevitable result of human habitation. So I don&#39;t think the magic 500 years I&#39;m speaking about has only occurred once in the millions of years that hominids have existed. Especially not when you take into account the ancient megaliths and ruins that litter our world.</p>

<p>Precisely! Extraterrestrial origin is just one facet to explain the megaliths and shit. It is not necessary to involve any visitors, actually. I do truely believe that humans have been around for a very looooooong time, and that civilizations, even ones more advanced than we are today, could have existed, and fell victim to nature cataclysms or even self induced destructions periodically. If youve ever see the show on tv called <em>after people</em> or whatever it was called, all it takes is a few thousand years and almost every evidence of our existence will have yielded to natural processes of degradation. I think within ten thousand years, all of our infrastructure woukd be completely irrecognizable. </p>

<p>And, of course, this isnt even touching on the idea that <strong><em>other</em></strong> homids couldve had complex civilizations before us!</p>

<p>Aliens, ancient humans, ancient hominids, all are equally plausible when considering the creators of the megaliths we find today. And, additionally, each could be an explanation for the UFOs we see today. They dont have to be <em>visitors,</em> per se. They could also be <em>survivors.</em></p>

<p>Well we are kind of watching this process occur right now. Our species has spread over this globe like a plague. No real plan or organization just humans everywhere. Then our technology increased to the point where we had weapons capable of eradicating life. You can almost hear the hands of clock.</p>

<p>Right... this idea obsesses me. A few thousand years in the ground and most ferrous metallic construction and it&#39;s evidence would be wiped out. And the paper records of such a society would be long gone before the metal degraded. Another thing is what about electro-magnetic data storage methods? None of that stuff we leave behind will last as long as the paper I bet. Not to mention how useless that technology would be without a power grid.</p>

<p>This is pretty much how I read it. It is also I think much more likely that a earth based species would manipulate and screw with us rather than an extraterrestrial species. If only because they would be local but also well.. Humans are just wicked.</p>

<p>I like the direction that this notion promises. Another facet could be purely survival-based. Competition for resources could provide a well enough motive for whatever they are doing. It stands to reason that we out number them (whoever/whatever &quot;they&quot; are) by quite a large ratio. So, approaching us with brute force, even considering their possibly more advanced techonolgy, probably wouldnt bid them well. Especislly now thst we have nukes and our oft irrational tendencies. I believe it would make sense to infiltrate us, and destroy us (or at least render us as no longer a threat) from the inside. This &quot;competition&quot; argument makes sense for aliens and other homids alike.</p>

<p>But, maybe less so for the proposed &quot;ancient humans&quot; (i feel it would be more appropraite to refer to them as &quot;Antidelluvians&quot; henceforth, unless you object). Being of the same species, just a difference in cultural paradigms could offer a reasonable motive to do their UFO-shenaningens and stuff. With malevolence or benevolence, well thats a different discussion i guess haha. Not sure where i stand on that much...</p>

<p>The paradigm that seems to really stick out in ancient writing about our &quot;gods&quot; is that they are extremely dynastic. They are very jealous of their families wealth and power. They also fight within the family to control that wealth and power. Even if the antidelluvians (good term) are human they still would probably see us primitive garbage compared to themselves. We would also represent bloodlines that are alien to them.  So I&#39;m sure they could sell us down the river exactly like the people who control the US government did during 9/11 for instance. That was all about people trying to advance their dynasty (Bush, Rockefeller, Rothchild) at the expense of the whole world.</p>

<p>Thats what im saying. The flood myth has origins in thousands of different cultures that are considered to have had no contact with eachother. Many of the stories in the bible can be found in older texts. I have a sneaky suspicion that thisbis why the library in alexandria was sacked amlnd why the conquistadors all but erased entirely the indigenous south american peoples religions/cultures/legends/myths/etc... Tue council of nicea was sought to cannonize specific books into what is now known as the bible, yet these books are rehashes of older stories that, when <strong><em>ALL</em></strong> are considered side by side, tell a different version of things than the abrahamic religions wish to have us believe. </p>

<p>The theory is that these texts refer to alien beings with terrific power and vast knowledge who came to earth and brought humans or shared their knowledge with humans allowing us to develop technologically.  </p>

<p>The entire theory hinges on the interpretation of Annunaki.  If you accept the translation as &quot;sky people&quot; then it certainly seems to refer to angels or aliens or some extra worldly being with the ability to fly.</p>

<p>If you accept the theory that Annunaki translates to &quot;princely people&quot; or &quot;holy people&quot; the text describes a knowledgeable class or race of people sharing knowledge.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive been searching for a source to back up what im about to say, ill find it, its just tedious. But anyhow, there was a study done after the genome project back in 2001 that found 223 genes in the human genome that have not ever been identified in the animal kingdom, anywhere. And when you consider the fact that the difference between humans and chimos is roughly 300 genes, you can see the significance.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the neanderthals do not have these genes, so the mutations (or other method or means of our adoption of these genes) came about rather recently, and considerably abruptly. This cannot be explained using the theory of evolution, as the TofE says these kinds of mutations occur over long periods of time. </p>

<p>There is talk about bacterial lineal transmission of these genes into humans, which is known to occur in significsntly less amount of cases. Additionally, geneticists sometimes use bacteria for genetic manipulation studies. </p>

<p>All this is supported by <del>many</del> some studies im trying to find and is still not confirmed either way. I am currently looking through a bunch of shit to post here to show you what im talking about. Its intetesting stuff... And with only a small amount of imaginative deducement, the stories of the annunaki genetically modifying some indigenous species on earth to create humans become more and more plausible...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6822/full/409860a0.html">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6822/full/409860a0.html</a></p>

<p>This is the study from nature magazine issue 409. Its a lot to read, but somewhere far down they begin talking about the 223 genes. They arent completely convinced they were transferred over from bacteria...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Probable horizontal transfer.
An interesting category is a set of 223 proteins that have significant similarity to proteins from bacteria, but no comparable similarity to proteins from yeast, worm, fly and mustard weed, or indeed from any other (nonvertebrate) eukaryote. These sequences should not represent bacterial contamination in the draft human sequence, because we filtered the sequence to eliminate sequences that were essentially identical to known bacterial plasmid, transposon or chromosomal DNA (such as the host strains for the large-insert clones). To investigate whether these were genuine human sequences, we designed PCR primers for 35 of these genes and confirmed that most could be readily detected directly in human genomic DNA (Table 24). Orthologues of many of these genes have also been detected in other vertebrates (Table 24).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An orthologue, btw, is a gene sequence that is similar to anothet found in genomes, but not exactly the same. Similar to how an analogue of a controlled substance (drug analogue) is considered to be controlled as well since it is similar to the controlled substance. Then they say this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In addition, the functional repertoire of these genes, which largely encode intracellular enzymes (Table 24), is uncharacteristic of vertebrate-specific evolutionary innovations </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this link, the authors arent really convinced that any genes were transferred over from bacteria. Not even the 40...</p>

<p>Here are some links discussing the possibility that any evidence of extraterrestrial existence might be found in our DNA:</p>

<p><a href="http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/3034876">http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/3034876</a></p>

<p>Here is a link (probably more on the fringe side of things, but i believe we can handle its content appropriately) that discusses connections between all this and the annunaki, largrly considering sitchins translations:</p>

<p><a href="http://eden-saga.com/en/biology-genetics-sitchin-creationism-human-genome-sequencing-two-hundred-twenty-three-alien-genes.html">http://eden-saga.com/en/biology-genetics-sitchin-creationism-human-genome-sequencing-two-hundred-twenty-three-alien-genes.html</a></p>

<p>This has taken me almost all of my free time i have available in one day. Im still searching for more sources and whatnot, but i believe this to he a rather good start. </p>

<p>It is incredibly intriguing to me. Considering all of this info, and the fact that scientists dont understand more than 98% of our dna (see <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncoding_DNA">Junk DNA</a>), this is one theory that begins to build mystery and plausibility at the same time. Not even the experts have a clue of where this stuff came from or what it does. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, ill continue my search for some more sources...</p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT</em></strong> And yes, that is another example of a human specific gene that isnt reslly ffound elsewhere. This specific one, the FOXP2, is believed to be solely responsibpe for human speech abilities... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just finished watching the Ancient Knowledge Series on Youtube, along with alot of other videos on ancient peoples/pyramids etc.  </p>

<p>I am also fascinated with alien theories and stories.  </p>

<p>In that Ancient Knowledge video (which i cannot verify the truthiness of the material) there are a few scientists etc that are starting to find things that disprove or at least largely question the theory of evolution.  And start to lead to intelligent design.  Not by a bearded god whose voice comes from the clouds, but more like the way i think of intelligent design as an alien civilization that seeded the earth. </p>

<p>This is all just me rambling for a few minutes at work, which is why most of my thoughts are half baked stream of consciousness type thinking.  </p>

<p>But lately when i think of a god, i am leaning more towards a Prometheus style population of earth.  Aliens planted a few of their kind on earth.  We have evolved slightly over the last few thousands of years adapting to the environment on earth.  And every once in a while the aliens come down to check on us.  </p>

<p>What the purpose of it all is idk.  Just an alien science experiment?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assume you got the debunking from this dude:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sitchiniswrong.com/anunnaki/anunnaki.htm">http://www.sitchiniswrong.com/anunnaki/anunnaki.htm</a></p>

<p>But the annunaki surely were a part of ancient culture:</p>

<p><a href="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/anunna/">http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/anunna/</a></p>

<p>That link offers quite a bit of citations.</p>

<p>But, imo, sitchins credentials surpass those of the debunkers, as only a handful of people in the world can even read sumerian and akkadian and translate them as well. Im not saying that i believe in sitchin 100%, but, as far as i know, he was the leading scholar on this topic. </p>

<p>Plus, considering the fact that egyptologists continually dismiss concrete evidence that the sphynx was built before the ancient egyptian dynasties (evidence includes precipital erosion which could only have occured when the climate there was wetter, placing the construction dates well beyond whst they will accept), i can say i trust mainstream archeologists much. </p>

<p>They tend to dismiss good evidence that doesnt fit their already established narratives. Call it a conspiracy, call it egocentrism and pride, whatever. I believe it stands to reason that many folks would go far out of their way to discredit sitchins translations due to the impact they would have if accepted. Literally our entire understanding and currently accepted paradigms would have to be changed...</p>

<p>Imagine a piece of A4 with two characters drawn at each end. In their two-dimensional world, they would have to walk the length of the page to meet each other. Now roll the paper into a tube so that both characters are on top of each other. </p>

<p>In their 2D world, they would still need to walk the length of the page to meet, but to us, we can see they are actually sitting on top of each other, separated by just the thickness of the paper. We would say &quot;why walk the length of the page, when you could sidestep 1mm to see them?&quot;</p>

<p>I sometimes think about this when I read about &quot;curved space-time&quot;. Could our universe be tightly rolled into a tube? Or maybe twisted into a spiral? Or perhaps scrunched into a ball? Or even all three!</p>

<p>Every religion tells a startlingly similar tale of humans and visitations from the gods.  We have ridiculously huge jumps in human ability that doesn&#39;t seem to have a reasonable cause.  Pyramids built in a time in which this would have taken thousands of years, or in which we didn&#39;t have the technology to do so.  Statues on easter island, stonehenge, just to name a few things that would have been impossible based on the technology known to exist. </p>

<p>Water erosion marks on the sphinx in the middle of the desert.  Underwater pyramids and manmade structures underwater seem to indicate we are missing an entire section of humanity&#39;s existence before current epoch.  </p>

<p>One thing that explains this is a previous ancient civilization that was visited by &quot;the gods&quot; or extraterrestrials.  I don&#39;t think the evidence is there to confirm this absolutely, but the evidence now seems to counter the idea of humanity only having come up 10000 years ago.  And doesn&#39;t explain how such great feats occurred in a time in which literally nothing found can explain it. </p>

<p>1973 - Two men claim to have been abducted by aliens while fishing near Pascagoula, Mississippi. They are interviewed by a local sheriff who afterwards leaves them alone but secretly records their conversation. He suspects that their private conversation will reveal a hoax, but the men continue to discuss the event between themselves as if they are terrified and shaken.  </p>

<p>1975 - A group of Arizona loggers encounter a UFO in the woods. One of them, named Travis Walton, approaches and is struck by a beam of light, knocking him to the ground. Believing he had been killed, his friends flee. When they return later to search for him, he is missing. A major police search begins, and the loggers are polygraphed about the event. All who completed the test pass. Several days later Walton reappears in a nearby town, dazed and bedraggled, mumbling about beings with terrifying eyes.  </p>

<p>1976 - Four men claim to have been abducted and given medical examinations by aliens while camping in Allagash, Maine. All four pass lie detector tests when questioned about their experiences.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for posting some of these credible stories.  It seems to be that, because of the seemingly improbable claims of a lot of these UFO or alien encounters, only the events with significant evidence seem to mean anything, as the rest can be brushed off by skeptics</p>

<p>And to clarify, I am not suggesting there is anything wrong with that, skepticism is a very necessary, just pointing out that a lot of testimony and circumstantial evidence would be considered much more easily and add more credibility than if the claims weren&#39;t about something people assume is crazy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I start by looking at how many various sightings there have been throughout history and imagine there have to be at least a couple of those people that reported them were not delusional or lying.</p>

<p>Then I factor in, without ascribing any validity to current pop-culture ancient alien nonsense, how most ancient cultures in total isolation from each other have some form of story of people coming from the sky. When you think about that, it is a crazy idea. Where in the hell would people get the idea other people could come out of the sky? It is quite a leap. Look at the ocean. If fish never came to the surface, there wouldn&#39;t be any reason to think there was anything living in there. I think of space and the ocean as similar things perception wise. They are vast inscrutable environments. People have been exposed to them for the same amount of time. But we don&#39;t see a huge preponderance of cultures saying their gods come out of the ocean, many more say they come from the sky. I think that is significant.</p>

<p>Then you have a lot of people who will admit that the universe being as vast as it is, there are sure to be some other life forms out there, but the likelihood of them having the ability to get here is ridiculous. Well, I think <em>that</em> is ridiculous. I don&#39;t think interstellar travel is some super magic thing that is impossible to attain. I think once you get the trick to it, it is trivial. The idea of supersonic airplanes was absurd 200 years ago, some people believed breaking the speed of sound would end the world. </p>

<p>There are probably civilizations that are millions of years old. Think about that. We got to space in 3000 years. How about if we had a thousand times that amount of time to develop technology? Does anyone really think a civilization like that is still grubbing around in the dirt on their homeworld after a few million years, or that the resources of a planet could sustain the development of an active productive civilization for that long? </p>

<p>So it isn&#39;t any one thing or video or testimony or piece of evidence that makes me think that we are visited, it is the aggregate of all of those things. And also the thought that if I was a super advanced culture I would be highly interested in other civilizations as they developed, but I would want nothing to do with them directly. And I could probably hide myself pretty well if I was so inclined. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Millions of people see UFOs every year and they have been seeing them for thousands of years.  Granted a lot of these UFOs are likely top secret human technology, but if just 1 of these UFOs from the millions upon millions of sightings was an alien craft, then we&#39;ve been visited. I&#39;m going to go with the odds and say that at least 1 person in the history of UFO sightings actually saw an alien craft.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a number of documents which suggest that government officials believed some UFOs to be of alien origin:  </p>

<p>1947 - General George Schulgen sends a memo to General Nathan Twining inquiring about the UFO situation. Twining, then-head of Air Material Command&#39;s intelligence and engineering divisions at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, sends a reply now known as the Twining Memo. It states, in part, that &quot;The phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary or fictitious. [...] There are objects probably approximately the shape of a disc, of such appreciable size as to appear to be as large as a man-made aircraft. [...] The reported operating characteristics such as extreme rates of climb, maneuverability (particularly in roll), and action which must be considered evasive when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft and radar, lend belief to the possibility that some of the objects are controlled either manually, automatically or remotely.&quot;</p>

<p>1948 - The Air Force undertakes Project Sign to study UFOs. The report concludes that while many UFO sightings have mundane explanations, some are likely of extraterrestrial origin. When the study reaches the desk of General Hoyt Vandenberg, he orders all copies of it destroyed and disbands the project.</p>

<p>1949 - The Air Force replaces Project Sign with Project Grudge and beings a PR campaign to let the American people know that UFOs can all be explained as mundane phenomena.</p>

<p>1949 - The FBI issues a classified memo entitled &quot;Protection of Vital Installations&quot;. The document notes that “Army intelligence has recently said that the matter of ‘Unidentified Aircraft’ or ‘Unidentified Aerial Phenomena,’ otherwise known as ‘Flying Discs,’ ‘Flying Saucers,’ and ‘Balls of Fire,’ is considered top secret by intelligence officers of both the Army and the Air Forces&quot;. The memo expresses concern over the violation of airspace over Los Alamos and other sensitive facilities by unknown craft displaying exceptional maneuverability and travelling at up to 27,000 mph.</p>

<p>1952 - H. Marshall Chadwell, the CIA&#39;s director of scientific intelligence, sends a memo to CIA Director Walter Smith stating, &quot;At this time, the reports of incidents convince us that there is something going on that must have immediate attention.... Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and travelling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or known types of aerial vehicles.”</p>

<p>1954 - Maxwell Air Force Base sends an emergency memo to the CIA, NSA, and Joint Chiefs of Staff stating that a saucer-like flying object rapidly entered their airspace, hovered for some time, and then just as rapidly vanished.</p>

<p>1980 - Dozens of U.S. Air Force personnel witness lights and a landed craft of unexplained origin in Rendlesham Forest, just outside of a British air base which is being used at the time by the United States. Deputy base commander Lt. Col. Charles Halt describes the incident in a memo to the Ministry of Defense.</p>

<p>1999 - A group of high-ranking French military officers and aerospace officials issue the COMETA Report, which states that approximately 5% of UFO sightings are conventionally inexplicable and that the best hypothesis to explain them is that they are of extraterrestrial origin.  </p>

<p>Please don&#39;t think this is a series of accidents, if it were it is the most perfect series of accidents that could ever happen to dumb down and divide a nation I would say the possibility is astronomical. Reading the hidden hand account and the law of one will help you see this very clearly. In the Quran 53 : 49 it speaks of the Lord of Sirius and many many sources speak of the Orion group. If you know your mythology, you will know that the dogs (Sirius) faithfully follow the hunter (Orion).</p>

<p>Whilst I agree that these things all happen, what has that got to do with Aliens? This is unfortunately a part of human nature and of those with unlimited power. I don&#39;t get what relevance this has to aliens but i would love an explanation as i am genuinely interested. </p>

<p>Most of the things you mentioned allude to enslave/depopulation/control/etc - why, if they had alien technology would they do this over an extended, prolonged period of time in the ways that you have said? </p>

<p>Please dont take this as an argument as it is just a question, i hope it doesn&#39;t come off too standoff&#39;ish. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because this is a free will universe, it cannot be done by just a drop down invasion. So they take your free will through subversion, religion,TV, cultural narratives, lies, deceit, etc. They know our minds as they gave us our worst parts it is NOT human nature todo these things, this is what you have become programmed to believe.You are not going to come to any conclusions no matter how long my post will be, you need to inform yourself and come up with your own opinion. More people are awakening to this reality and the sooner the better, our nation wants WW3 so bad you can see Obama practically drooling for it in his latest speeches. If he really cared he would do things like have a visit to Syria speak with their president or invite him here or do Skype. Why have the last 4 presidents regardless of &quot;party&quot; not changed their tune?</p>

<p>You should if you like read it as fiction if you like but read The hidden Hand from above top secret, the law of one RA material, &quot;the biggest secret&quot; by David Icke, The Matrix series by Val Valerian and really a ton of other books, I find they (certain books) come into my life as I need them. Also The Nag Hammadi library the gnostic Jesus wasn&#39;t about turning the other cheek but stated we had archons or rulers that were from a mistake, a blind god Yalbadoath. There is a common theme throughout history we like to call myth but why does this myth permeate over and over throughout every culture. St. George versus the Dragon. St. Patrick drove Snakes out of Ireland? 4% of people believe in reptilians, while this is scoffed at in the media and joked up, there is a lot of evidence throughout history of these beings. </p>

<p>TRUST ME I did not WANT to go down this path, I do not want to brag but I have a high IQ, 6 figure job, live in a perfect home, so this is not coming from anything but pure knowledge seeking not a blame game or me not being able to understand this reality. I was an atheist, science minded individual (If I cant see it it or test it, it isn&#39;t there type). I was attacked by something in late 2012 that came into this dimension attacked me and my wife had to &quot;awaken&quot; me from a pale milk white wide eyed stupor, it felt like I was phasing back to this reality. This thing was pure fucking evil and the attack left no marks but I felt all the physical pain of being disemboweled by its claws, it was reptilian black with red eyes and more than one row of teeth. I brushed it off as a hallucination as I could not comprehend it. I think it did not hurt me because I stated no no no stop it you are hurting me forcefully (law of free will). I think this law like gravity was the only thing that protected me. It also slightly possessed me post the attack. I grabbed my wife&#39;s breast and crotch in a forceful manner and sounding like a greasy pervert said &quot;Oh yeah baby that&#39;s what I like&quot;. This is totally out of character for me and not anything I would say, I was like a backseat driver during the event a witness to it but behind where my consciousness normally is. I could see it go down but could not control it. Afterwards I basically was so frightened I slept like a child with my wife. I understand how ridiculous this sounds to the normal person but this event started my journey in the search, like I said I was happy with being an egoist, intellectual, that &quot;knew&quot; everything. Now my main objective is to awaken people. read my other posts if you like, I comment a lot but it is all there.</p>

<p>The trick is to ridicule and make fun of conspiracy theorists or aliens etc. I mean please we are in a galaxy with hundreds of millions of stars each with planetary systems in a sea of trillions of galaxies, one has to be absolutely mind controlled to NOT KNOW there is other life. These guys are winning and it must be the responsibility of those in the know to spread this info. It has not been easy for me, I have lost friends and family over this, they claim I am mental etc. The ones that do get it are very few typically the smarter types with open minds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I could give all my upvotes away for people to take this shit seriously I would. There is an end game and it ends with us in cages or slaughtered. I do not know about you, but while this may be considered a &quot;game&quot; which from many accounts it is, I have skin in the game literally. I have a little daughter who I do not want to see in her beautiful eyes the sheer terror that is awaiting us all if we do not at the very fucking least stop this government from it&#39;s non stop slaughter. </p>

<p>They erase their karma by announcing it first (at least this is their belief system) kinda like if you touch me I will break your nose and the person touches you it&#39;s ok to punch their nose at least by your own logic. Have you noticed they ALWAYS announce what they are going to before a massive slaughter and they do it in the most calm voice? The last 4 presidents have done this.  Before that, JFK spoke about secret societies and was shot 2 years later. Before him we were warned by Eisenhower about the military industrial complex and yet STILL the average human sits there and absolutely denies or cannot connect the dots to what this all means.</p>

<p>Reagan gave that speech about how we could be united if their was a common alien threat, well guess what kids this shit has been happening right under our noses and no matter how &quot;smart&quot; you THINK you are you have to be an utter fucking moron to not see the parallels I have drawn here. Do you think I am making this shit up? Why to troll? I am smarter than that and would come up with better shit than this trust me. Everything I say I am absolutely serious as a fucking heart attack. I have MUCH better shit to do with my time than this. I feel obligated because I did have these experiences and have connected the dots to share it with my fellow man. Like I said I would give up all my upvotes, my house, my car, all of my personal physical belongings to have a million people honestly take the time and do the research themselves or connect the dots and then spread this information to others. Again what in the world would I have to gain by this occurring? A big prank? Like I said I would have a better prank than this shit that has been spouted by many before me and is not original. If I am gonna prank I can think of 1000 other things more ingenious and fun than this crap.</p>

<p>Seriously people pull your heads out of your asses and just for &quot;fun&quot; consider it without believing it and look throughout history and why we only have written history that dates back 6000 BC. Are we that bad at record keeping? Nah this shit has been destroyed over and over as have all truth speakers. Our species is MUCH older than you think and we were NOT fucking cavemen or stupid tens of thousands of years ago like that SHITHOLE movie 10,000BC portrayed. Lloyd Pye take the time and watch his stuff. Mark Passio. Nassim Haremein. Do not look from the perspective of trying to debunk because technically anything can be debunked. Do the Aristotle method of&quot; it takes a wise man to entertain an idea but not necessarily believe in it. This is truly the only theory of human history that makes sense. We are not stupid, we have been bred to think so and do so. Have you not been taught your whole life from early childhood you were a piece of shit? Whether from the church, school, parents trust me this is a common theme think about this honestly people.</p>

<p>Good luck in your searches the TRUTH is OUT THERE!</p>

<p>As much as you feel comfortable sharing. What were your other encounters? Id prefer as much details as i can get, but i understand if its difficult. Particularily:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Setting (Time, Place, Weather outside, dates so i can compare astronomical phenamena as well, such as possible relationships to equinoxes and stuff, or to find out if none of the astronomical stuff is relevant...)</p></li>
<li><p>Descriptions of the entities</p></li>
<li><p>Your personal thoughts at the time</p></li>
<li><p>what you sensed (felt, smelt, heard, saw, etc.)</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know much about aliens/exobiology, but I always thought the essay by Robin Hanson, entitled <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/greatfilter.html">The Great Filter</a> gave some interesting perspective:</p>

<p>&quot;Within the next million years (at most) therefore, our descendants seem to have a foreseeable (greater than one in a thousand) chance of reaching an &quot;explosive&quot; point, where they expand outward at near the speed of light to colonize our galaxy, and then the universe, easily overpowering any less developed life in the way. FTL (faster than light) travel would imply even faster expansion.
We expect such an explosion to fill most every available niche containing usable mass or negentroy resources. And even if the most valuable resources are between the stars or at galactic centers, we expect some of our descendants to make use of most all the matter and energy resources they can economically reach, including those in &quot;backwater&quot; solar systems like ours and those near us.</p>

<p>Once an explosion goes beyond the scale where a single disaster, such as a supernovae, could destroy it, to become a &quot;lasting&quot; explosion of advanced life, it should only be stopped by meeting another explosion of similarly-advanced life. After that, if disaster befalls some long-established colony, others should soon return to try again.</p>

<p>Without FTL travel to mediate conformity, we would also not be surprised by a great diversity among the different parts of an explosion, and especially among different explosions [Hoerner 78]. We would expect, for example, different cultures, languages, and body form details. We expect much less diversity, however, regarding choices which would put a civilization or entity at a strong competitive reproductive disadvantage.</p>

<p>For example, while one can imagine predatory probes sent to search and destroy other life [Brin 83], it is harder to understand why such probes would not also aggressively colonize the systems they visited, if such colonization were cheap. Aggressive colonization would give them all the more probes to work with, and deny resources to competitors. If this colonization effort could hide its origins from those who might retaliate, what would they have to lose?</p>

<p>Similarly, while some groups might plausibly leave some places &quot;fallow&quot; as information-generating &quot;nature preserves&quot; [Fogg 87], it is much harder to imagine that most places would be so preserved. There should be diminishing returns to such information, and groups that use more of their resources should be at a competitive advantage. And given the vastness of space, substantial resources should be required to keep &quot;poachers&quot; from slipping in to colonize such a preserve.</p>

<p>Finally, we expect advanced life to substantially disturb the places it colonizes. Whenever natural systems are not ideally structured to support colonists, we expect changes to be made. And unless ideal structures always either closely mimic natural appearances or are effectively invisible, we expect advanced life to make visible changes.</p>

<p>For example, it only takes a small amount of nuclear waste dropped into to visibly change its spectra [Whitmire &amp; Wright 80.] And a civilization might convert enough of a star&#39;s asteroids into orbiting solar-energy collectors to collect a substantial fraction of this star&#39;s output, thereby substantially changing the star&#39;s spectral, temporal, and spatial appearances. Even more advanced colonists may disassemble stars [Criswell 85] or enclose them in Dyson spheres well within a million years of arrival. Galaxies may even be restructured wholesale [Dyson 66].</p>

<p>If such advanced life had substantially colonized our planet, we would know it by now. We would also know it if they had restructured most of our solar system&#39;s asteroid belt (though much smaller colonies could be hard to detect [Papagiannis 78]). And they certainly haven&#39;t disassembled Jupiter or our sun. We should even know it if they had aggressively colonized most of the nearby stars, but left us as a &quot;nature preserve&quot;.</p>

<p>Our planet and solar system, however, don&#39;t look substantially colonized by advanced competitive life from the stars, and neither does anything else we see. To the contrary, we have had great success at explaining the behavior of our planet and solar system, nearby stars, our galaxy, and even other galaxies, via simple &quot;dead&quot; physical processes, rather than the complex purposeful processes of advanced life. Given how similar our galaxy looks to nearby galaxies, it would even be hard to see how our whole galaxy could be a &quot;nature preserve&quot; among substantially-restructured galaxies.</p>

<p>These considerations strongly suggest that no civilization in our past universe has reached such an &quot;explosive&quot; point, to become the source of a light speed expansion of thorough colonization. (That is, no civilization within the past light cone of a million years ago for us; see Technical Appendix below). Much follows from this one important data point [Hart 75, Tipler 80].&quot;</p>

<p>TLDR: If there are/have been aliens, they haven&#39;t made it past the Great Filter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If i am to answer honestly, id have to say im not sure. I do believe aliens exist, but its a different question altogether whether they have already visited us.</p>

<p>But, i tend to lean towards the believing side. My rationale is that if billions of people believe in the bible and koran, believing in the common themes from ancient texts of all other cultures, some of which predate the bible (sumerians, egyptians, etc...) is not only just a founded, but, imo, more logical, as it is not as biased as believing in just one ideology. </p>

<p>There is a ton of shit out there that doesnt make sense if we are to take the currently accepted perception of our origins and our history. Puma Punku is a megalithic site that illustrates this fantastically. </p>

<p>But, my issue is that it isnt necessary for aliens to have visited us in order to explain things like puma punku, the giza pyramids, etc etc. The other explanation i can come up with is that human civilization has been around much <strong><em>much</em></strong> longer than currently admitted. There is plenty of cultures that support this, too. </p>

<p>So, this is why im not exactly sure. Is it all aliens? Or just really old human civilizations ? UFOs dont even have to be extraterrestrial, either. They could just be surviving humans from a much much older era. </p>

<p>But, nonetheless, i DO believe it is either case. If not ancient human civilization, its aliens. If its neither, then i suppose there is a possibility of another ancient indigenous species from earth that is currently unknown that could be behind all of it...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems most responses have been essentially yes - because of various ancient aliens theories.</p>

<p>I am more inclined to say yes, but for a different reason.  I am very interested in UFO&#39;s and the evidence for them is enormous.  There have been so many government officials, aircraft pilots, astronauts, etc that have come forward and said that ufo&#39;s are real and the government is intent on covering them up.  Many have also come forward and said that the government is in contact with ET&#39;s and has been for a while.</p>

<p>This, combined with the widespread Roswell reports, combined with crop circles, combined with countless reports of UFO sightings around the world, on a daily basis, is what leads me to believe that ET&#39;s are here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people give too much credit to the government here.</p>

<p>If an alien species can travel light years to reach us, or shift through dimensions, then they most certainly could prove their existence to all of humanity if they wanted to.</p>

<p>If you look at all the world religions, many of them have characters who bring knowledge to humans, and are demonized for it. I think a sort of &quot;Prime Directive&quot; attitude is taken by most ETs, under the belief that technological progress that outpaces evolutionary progress is highly dangerous.</p>

<p>For instance, we have recently just <em>barely</em> avoided nuclear war. If our brains were even more primitive, we might all be dead already.</p>

<p>In fact, given that there have been numerous reports of UFOs closely monitoring nuclear facilities, we may actually be too primitive, and it may have been these &quot;Angels&quot; that saved us from ourselves.</p>

<p>I know that personally, in the time that I&#39;ve had a smart phone, I&#39;ve spent more and more time alone, inside. I have my phone on me a lot more -- but I rarely go outside. You have to be outside to see UFOs.</p>

<p>Likewise, the people who are less likely to have smart phones are more likely to see UFOs. Rural areas cover a lot more land, and &quot;prime directive&quot; style aliens would avoid cities.</p>

<p>That being said, I&#39;d wager that filming a actually have increased, despite those drawbacks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im surprised that no one has mentioned their own alien experience.
When I was 8 years old I had an experience. I woke up in my bed and looked towards the door to my bedroom. There was an &quot;alien&quot; just outside the door. I turned around and got close to the wall and was so shocked that I didn&#39;t no what to do, and had no where to go. When nothing had happened for a while, I got the courage to look back towards the door and it was gone.
Earlier that evening I did see a lit up figure in the sky, just hovering. Then it just took off and disappeared. 
So yeah, I think that there are alien visitors.
Although, my husband thinks that I was dreaming/imagining it. I can&#39;t say for sure, but it was real for me at that time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, because Pleiadians. It seems more logical to me that a highly evolved community of aliens (intelligence) would exist in a pure sentient energy state that allows them to exist anywhere in the universe at any moment without having to overcome the physical restrictions of time/space travel. In other words, they&#39;ve had a million year evolutionary head start and have already achieved transcendence beyond the bounds of this physical dimension. Like our souls. After all, what is the evolutionary end game of life if not to evolve to a higher state of existence. I believe we are old souls from ancient cosmic communities of energy and intelligence that universally exists beyond the physical dimension.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is teleological. Are you a closet Hegelian?</p>

<p>&quot;Evolution&quot; is often misrepresented in New Age rhetoric as driving towards some higher state or purpose. This is metaphorical. For example, if I meditate, I can &quot;evolve&quot; my consciousness to a deeper state of understanding. In a way this is a &quot;spiritual evolution&quot; - a process of becoming, to a &quot;higher&quot; existence (&quot;higher&quot; because of my value judgments placing awareness on an arbitrary vertical scale).</p>

<p>But this is distinct from physical &amp; biological evolution and should not be conflated.</p>

<p>Evolution is blind and dumb and tends statistically toward whatever increases fitness at the time of selection in response to a particular selective pressure. The consequence of this is that species may evolve themselves into a corner and trap themselves in a &quot;dead end&quot;- e.g. the mollusc eye (aperture vs. resolution trade-off); <a href="http://www.molluscs.at/mollusca/eyes.html">http://www.molluscs.at/mollusca/eyes.html</a></p>

<p>See also Manfred Eigen&#39;s formulation of fitness landscapes.</p>

<p>I recommend Dennett&#39;s &quot;Darwin&#39;s Dangerous Idea&quot; for a contemporary treatment of evolutionary theory - it sounds like you&#39;re a bit confused about biological evolution.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only do I think aliens came to our planet thousands of years ago, I believe some of these beings visit us still to this day.  Going one step further, it is my opinion that an alien presence currently inhabits parts of this planet.  We are not alone, on Earth. </p>

<p>Edit: Why?  Some say the aliens are exploiting Earth of its precious metals and elements.  Others say they are here more as observers due to our biological diversity.  My opinion crosses both of these theories.</p>

<p>Looking out into the cosmos I question what might motivate a technologically advanced race of beings to travel all the way to our little blue speck.  What would hold true economic value among the stars?</p>

<p>Maybe, Stars themselves (energy), Solar systems (materials) and the most valuable of all, inhabitable planets (life).  On the micro-scale side of a universal view.  You can extrapolate this theory to infinity on the macro, should the multiverse exist.  Earth is a jewel of the cosmos, and we have been conquered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t like the word &quot;believe.&quot; It has way too many connotations in english. </p>

<p>It&#39;s possible to consider things without actually believing them. It&#39;s possible to be 75% sure of something but always to hold it as an idea that could possibly be wrong.</p>

<p>That is how I feel about aliens. I think that from the moment we began broadcasting radio signals we would have attracted the attention of any nearby alien species.  But before that? Our sun would have just been another yellow star. Could something in it&#39;s spectrum have attracted miners or something from another world? </p>

<p>But to sum up here I guess I really don&#39;t think it is likely that aliens have visited our world. I will always keep the possibility open but its not likely.   If they wanted our resources it seems to me they would have taken them and there would have been nothing we could do about it but live on a resourceless rock or die during the extraction process.</p>

<p>Do they wish to conquer us? If so then where would the alien Satrap be located? I have to confess that one scenario does sort of intrigue me. What if the reason for such exorbitant taxes and constantly financial games are really about paying the aliens some kind of tribute? Perhaps the local ET Satrap is actually the person we think we are electing?</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t find that likely. Not as likely as previous human civilizations achieving technology and space flight. Perhaps they left and came back much later only to find the society that had launched them was at the bottom of an ocean and all their people were gone.</p>

<p>Essentially if anybody is in space around our sun and hanging out there it is most likely that their place of origin is in fact, earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, because there is absolutely and unconditionally no proof of any intelligent, sentient, conscious life outside of Earth.</p>

<p>Any UFO sighting can be explained by much more probable phenomena before you have to resort to creating an entirely new alien species of which there is absolutely no precedent.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s evolved somewhere in the universe - but visiting Earth? No chance.</p>

<p>1) Why do you discount human ingenuity and the pace at which technological advancement can increase when built upon previous technical advancement?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people give too much credit to the government here.</p>

<p>If an alien species can travel light years to reach us, or shift through dimensions, then they most certainly could prove their existence to all of humanity if they wanted to.</p>

<p>If you look at all the world religions, many of them have characters who bring knowledge to humans, and are demonized for it. I think a sort of &quot;Prime Directive&quot; attitude is taken by most ETs, under the belief that technological progress that outpaces evolutionary progress is highly dangerous.</p>

<p>For instance, we have recently just <em>barely</em> avoided nuclear war. If our brains were even more primitive, we might all be dead already.</p>

<p>In fact, given that there have been numerous reports of UFOs closely monitoring nuclear facilities, we may actually be too primitive, and it may have been these &quot;Angels&quot; that saved us from ourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have never really understood the value of gold. I guess it is a pretty metal and it has a comforting feel. </p>

<p>I realize it has technological and perhaps even health effects. Colloidal gold and silver are supposed to be wonder drugs according to some. But I don&#39;t have totally satisfactory data on that. Not enough to believe it.</p>

<p>With that said though I think the beautiful and reflectiveness of gold certainly lends itself to sun worship regalia. I imagine a man all decked out in gold standing in the sun before a crowd could be quite a spectacle. </p>

<p>But I don&#39;t really KNOW, why gold. What I do know though is that if the annunaki wanted it they sure left a lot of it behind.</p>
