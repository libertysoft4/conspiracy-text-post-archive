    <div class="md"><p>Definitely the right place. Interesting theory, but my money&#39;s on the more mundane and everyday: I&#39;d really, really like to know whether he was being prescribed medication and whether his dosage had been recently upped or discontinued. Has all the hallmarks of a &quot;psychoactive medication-induced act of violence/suicide.&quot; We&#39;re now hitting peak madness--at least two stories a week making it past the local news...Chicago ATC, the White House (multiple incidents there now)...It&#39;s getting so hot and heavy now, it&#39;s got to be any time now...of course, I said that after Aurora and Sandy Hook, too, but nope.

    <div class="md"><p>It is too easy to blame the people for madness when it is absolutely drenched within and without our society. The sickness is inherent in the system, it is flawed, poisoned, and manipulated. We can all agree that CIA and other groups are using media and other terrible devices to mind control the people, when these things happen I do not think madness I think this is a desperate attempt by someone who has had all of their options taken away. Think Falling Down. He wasn&#39;t crazy he had enough.</p>

<p>By being transferred out of state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess, but if you were pushed over the brink, wouldn&#39;t you go out differently? In a rage, maybe, but not crouched under a table, trying to slit your own neck with a knife? Reminds me of the guy who calmly tried to saw his own arms off in the middle of a West Covina Home Depot (<em>there&#39;s</em> a story that disappeared). It&#39;s not the action of a &quot;I&#39;ve had it with this place!&quot; break, but this plus the calm planning involved indicates a complete not-quite-in-this-realm anymore kind of break, both of which are hallmarks of these medication-involved psychotic episodes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, you may not believe me now - but watch and see under-the-covers changes for ATC personnel. FAA already bars pilots from taking Champix/Chantix, will be interesting to see if this expands (forcing patients off the stuff is a worse idea, though, because that can bring on episodes, too; they&#39;re going to have to be careful about it).</p>

<p>Honest to God, this is one of the biggest conspiracies out in plain sight. No one in authority will talk about it because they&#39;re afraid people will stop taking their medications, but there&#39;s not even any effort to educate people about it, which is frustrating (if you knew a bad reaction to something could make you have homicidal ideations, you might have a better chance of realizing it and seek help before you acted on them).</p>

<p>Edit: Hrm, looks like a lot of meds are banned (and I believe this applies to air traffic controllers, too): <a href="http://www.leftseat.com/psychotropic.htm">http://www.leftseat.com/psychotropic.htm</a> -- and Chantix is grounding until peak dosage side effects has been checked:  &quot;Chantix (Varenicline) is initially grounding until applicant demonstrates no adverse side-effects at 72hrs post peak dosage.&quot;  (Seriously, it would probably lower violent crime like 20% for <em>everyone</em>&#39;s doctors to do what the FAA is doing; some people can&#39;t metabolize this stuff, causing all kinds of havoc when they get dangerous levels circulating in their bloodstream.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The commercial doesn&#39;t say: &quot;Some people may build intricate firecracker bombs and place them all over the house. After which, they may decide to tie up their families. After this, they may decide to shoot their families, set off their bombs, and then kill themselves.&quot; Or &quot;Some people may feel a sudden urge to disembowel themselves publicly.&quot; Or &quot;Some teenagers may feel overcome with a sudden urge to self-immolate in the cafeteria.&quot; &quot;Some patients may feel a sudden urge to break into the White House. Set fire to their workplace. Shoot up their workplace. Suffocate their children. Jump off a bridge. Throw their children out windows. Jump off a building. Kill and eat their roommate. Dismember their coworkers. Shoot up the Navy Yard. Shoot up their school. Shoot up the movie theater.&quot;</p>

<p>You know, stuff like that.</p>

<p>A lot of lawyers are making money hand over fist under the cover of darkness with this stuff, and people continue to die, lives continue to be ruined. Cheaper for the pharmaceutical companies to settle, keep it under wraps, while the rest of the country believes it&#39;s all <em>their</em> fault - that they&#39;re legit mentally ill. Lawmakers let it happen because we can&#39;t let their 401K lynchpins&#39; stock drop. People let it happen because we&#39;re addicted to those meds and don&#39;t want to lose them, and the idea that this is really happening in front of our noses is too horrific to entertain.</p>

<p>Interesting theory, but having spoken to the nurses that treated him, he told them that he was sick and tired of a lying government. He was trying to commit suicide because of this. </p>

<p>I think the major thing to take away from his actions is the fact that what he did had such a major impact on the FAA. He mentioned how he simply wanted to sabotage the work of his employers, knowing that the government has several contingency plans to respond to catastrophes such as this. The fact that so many flights were shut down and many big problems occurred showed that these contingency plans are non-existent. More proof of a lying government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FAA does have contingency plans and they were used. While a lot of flights were delayed the minor impact seen by the flying public is due to the hard work and diligence of the Air Traffic Controls at Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center. Chicago ARTCC works approximately 7,500 aircraft a day to not expect some delays after losing an entire facility is a little silly. </p>
