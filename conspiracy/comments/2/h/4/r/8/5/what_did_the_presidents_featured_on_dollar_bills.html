        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;I have always been afraid of banks...If congress has the right under the Constitution to issue paper money, it was given them to use themselves, not to be delegated to individuals or corporations. &quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Andrew Jackson (on 20 dollar bill)</li>
</ul>

<p>“I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.” </p>

<ul>
<li>Thomas Jefferson (on 2 dollar bill)</li>
</ul>

<p>History records that the money changers have used every form of abuse, intrigue, deceit, and violent means possible to maintain their control over governments by  controlling money and its issuance. </p>

<ul>
<li>James Madison (on 5000 dollar bill)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Government should create, issue, and circulate all the currency and  credits needed to satisfy the spending power of the Government and the buying power of  consumers. By the adoption of these principles, the taxpayers will be saved immense sums of interest. Money will cease to be master and become the servant of humanity. </p>

<ul>
<li>Abraham  Lincoln (on 5 dollar bill)</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;But if in the pursuit of the means we should unfortunately stumble again on <strong>unfunded</strong> paper money or any similar species of fraud, we shall assuredly give a fatal stab to our national credit in its infancy. Paper money will invariably operate in the body of politics as spirit liquors on the human body. They prey on the vitals and ultimately destroy them. Paper money has had the effect in your state that it will ever have, to ruin commerce, oppress the honest, and open the door to every species of fraud and injustice.&quot; </p>

<ul>
<li>George Washington (1 dollar bill)</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s either a salute to a worthy foe, or more then likely the last and best insult they can give. I&#39;d say it&#39;s more of an insult considering the content. If it was a statue it might be a salute but printing his face on the very bank notes he opposed definately seems more of an insult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually Kennedy <em>eliminated the silver certificate</em>. Silver certificates were issued from 1878 to 1964. Kennedy had a law passed to phase them out in favor of Federal Reserve notes. Executive Order 11110 was an order giving0 the Treasury the power to keep printing them until the new Federal Reserve notes were ready. Before the new law passed, the Treasury could print them without presidential authorization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the quote &quot;I have always been afraid of banks&quot; is a real quote from Andrew Jackson. It seems to be a relatively recent invention. The rest of the quote is a fairly accurate paraphrase of what Jackon wrote in his <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/ajveto01.asp">&quot;Veto Message Regarding the Bank of the United States&quot;</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is maintained by some that the bank is a means of executing the constitutional power &quot;to coin money and regulate the value thereof.&quot; Congress have established a mint to coin money and passed laws to regulate the value thereof. The money so coined, with its value so regulated, and such foreign coins as Congress may adopt are the only currency known to the Constitution. But if they have other power to regulate the currency, it was conferred to be exercised by themselves, and not to be transferred to a corporation. If the bank be established for that purpose, with a charter unalterable without its consent, Congress have parted with their power for a term of years, during which the Constitution is a dead letter. It is neither necessary nor proper to transfer its legislative power to such a bank, and therefore unconstitutional.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>The quote from Thomas Jefferson is accurate. It is from <a href="http://www.britannica.com/presidents/article-9116907">this letter to John Taylor</a>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The quote from James Madison is not real. It&#39;s actually Olive Cushing Dwinell commenting on a quote from Alexander Hamilton in her book <a href="http://libertyparkusafd.org/lp/Hancock/CD-ROMS/GlobalFederation%5CGlobal%20-%2031%20-%20The%20Story%20of%20Our%20Money.html"><em>The Story of Our Money</em></a> (1946). Because of an editor&#39;s error, this author&#39;s note is followed by &quot;From Writings of Madison, previously quoted. Vol. 2, Page 14.&quot;, but it&#39;s clearly not from Madison.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The quote from Abraham Lincoln is actually Gerald McGeer&#39;s <em>interpretation</em> of Lincoln&#39;s monetary policy in his book <a href="http://heritech.com/pridger/lincoln/mcgeer/mcgeerv.htm"><em>The Conquest of Poverty</em></a> (1935).</p>

<p>Here are Lincoln&#39;s messages to Congress where he discusses banking and
money:</p>

</ul>

<hr/>

<p>I&#39;ve just started researching the alleged Washington quote. The sentence
&quot;Paper money has had the effect in your State that it ever will have, to
ruin commerce—oppress the honest, and open a door to every species of
fraud and injustice&quot; is from <a href="http://founders.archives.gov/GEWN-04-04-02-0428">this letter</a>.</p>

<p>The rest of the quote is not in the letter. So far I haven&#39;t been able to verify it.  <a href="http://thelastoutpost.com/classics/merrill-jenkins/a-treatise-on-monetary-reform.html">This website</a> —where the text may be from a 1982 book— just gives the other quote and says it&#39;s from 1789. But it doesn&#39;t give a source.</p>
