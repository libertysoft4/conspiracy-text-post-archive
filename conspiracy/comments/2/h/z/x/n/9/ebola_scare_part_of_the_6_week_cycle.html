    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get hung up on the &quot;6 weeks&quot; portion of the idea. Pay attention to the reality that state actors can and will promote their agenda by means of propaganda and disinformation tactics. The hypothesis of the 6 week cycle is that it takes around 6 weeks (4-8 weeks) for the events which promote state agendas to be placed into the broadcast news cycle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to buy into ironic responses. If this is a propaganda event, then the concern being promoted throughout r/conspiracy is itself fear-mongering. <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr4310/text/enr#link=A_X_H_1078_a&amp;amp;nearest=H3C8D18E917DD40CAABFB0544EEBC6DBD">Here&#39;s the Smith-Mundt Act Amendment</a> I referenced above. You can search any of the referenced acts in that section with &quot;Misuse&quot; in google and come up with hundreds of documents detailing that the interpretations of what is legitimately disseminated information are often times contrary to the well-being of the citizenry.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t conspiracy theory nuttiness. This is a piece of legislation that has been in effect for almost a year and a half. There is an allocated budget for the overall activity and broadcast channels by which the propaganda pieces are disseminated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, and it&#39;d be exactly like numerology except that the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 was passed in the National Defense Authorization Act 2013 authorizing government and military agencies in the following manner:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bill&#39;s purpose is &quot;to authorize the domestic dissemination of information and material about the United States intended primarily for foreign audiences&quot;[35] The act was added to the 2013 NDAA bill as section of 1078 to amend certain passages of Smith-Mundt Act of 1948 and Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1987.[36] The Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 passed Congress as part of the NDAA 2013 on December 28, 2012.[36] <strong>Amendments made to the Smith-Mundt Act of 1948 and Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1987 allow for materials produced by the State Department and the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) to be released within US borders.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So its jut like numerology provided numerology had an entity with a multi-billion dollar budget making its predictions appear true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What predictions do the 6-week cycle make? I may be ignorant, but as far as i know the whole theory is based on <em>something</em> happens as a false flag every six weeks. </p>

<p>Im just saying that it is easy enough to look back and find <em>something</em> that occured (e.g. a bombing, shooting, failed attempts, etc.) to fit this cycle. That doesnt necessarily prove anything unless there is proof that each of the events stated were indeed false flags, and that each event is proven to be connected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It means that government agencies can disseminate information created with techniques used on foreign populations (psy-ops (and standard diplomacy to be fair)) to US citizens. The Smith-Mundt Modernization Act effectively amended the Smith-Mundt Act which authorized the US Government to use propaganda techniques on foreign populations. The amended version allows the gov to use propaganda techniques on the US population. The amended act stipulates:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No funds authorized to be appropriated to the Department of State or the Broadcasting Board of Governors shall be used to influence public opinion in the United States. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is then immediately invalidated with the contents of the next line of the bill:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This section shall apply only to programs carried out pursuant to the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 (22 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.), the United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994 (22 U.S.C. 6201 et seq.), the Radio Broadcasting to Cuba Act (22 U.S.C. 1465 et seq.), and the Television Broadcasting to Cuba Act (22 U.S.C. 1465aa et seq.). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Google searches for &quot;misuse&quot; and the referenced acts lead the dedicated researcher to many instances of alleged fraud and abuse, suggesting further that the  interpretation of the acts themselves remain somewhat undecided as to what constitutes a breach of the intended legislation.</p>

<p>News follows a script. You ever notice the same talking points regardless of channel?

<p>There we go, pretty much what I was saying. </p>

<p>True, this resistance/enlightenment didn&#39;t stop American invasion, but even if the populace were dead-set against aggression, all it would&#39;ve taken was the media to sell them a handful of shitty reasons to support said aggression, something they did, and continue to do.</p>

<p>As to what we can do, look around and consider the options. We agree that most around us are drunk on Kool Aid. We also have seen that those who step out of line are stamped with &#39;truther&#39;, or &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39; labels and shunned. So what <em>do</em> we do? This is a great question, and one that has no clear answer apart from stay away from mainstream sources and draw your own conclusions as to what is happening. A mite anticlimactic of an answer maybe but if more like us got together maybe a solid solution could be reached?</p>

<p>Step 1 was see through it. We have, how do we take the conversation to step 2, what to do once you&#39;ve seen through it? What do you think step 2 entails? I don&#39;t think its fight the power. I think its more along the lines of identify and control the power. I think some of the modelling I do in that post opens the possibility of identifying and controlling the power structures around us.</p>

<p>Not really (see the quote below) And for arguments sake, if it did, that doesnt support <em>this</em> event is being lied about. Just the potential (im responding to both your comments with just this one, for ease). I mean, you are free to speculate. I get the skepticism. I just disagree that this has anything to do with the six week cycle. From your other comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its not just &quot;potential&quot;. Its a budget <strong><em>to lie</em></strong>, the means <strong><em>to lie</em></strong>, the incentive <strong><em>to lie,</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are installing the implication &quot;to lie&quot; here where it orignally does not exist. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>NDAA 2013 (HR 4310, Section 1078 (c)) <strong><em>does not make legal</em></strong> the dissemination of propaganda within the US that the Smith-Mundt Act has outlawed: <strong><em>&quot;No funds authorized to be appropriated to the Department of State or the Broadcasting Board of Governors shall be used to influence public opinion in the United States.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thats not to say this wont be abused, sure. But this is a poor argument that doesnt really support your claim. </p>

<p>And again, coming back to the six week cycle, shit happens often enough nowadays that <em>something</em> is bound to happen given the time parameters, that will inevitably fit such a broad and general prediction that <em>something</em> will happen, or that *some propaganda&quot; will be released. </p>

<p>Do you not understand the logical fallacy this claim is using to support its argument?</p>

<p>Just to be clear, that was pertaining to the six week cycle. However, this last comment of yours sparked a renewed interest for me.</p>

<p>I propose we start from the beginning. We can ignore the &quot;ebola/six-week-cycle&quot; connection <em>for now</em>, so that we can discuss this act better, then move on to see how it relates to your OP. Sound fair?</p>

<p>Ill start by expressing my understanding of the last part of your OP, so that its easier for you to lay it out in order. </p>

<p>Essentially, you are implying that this current case of ebola in dallas is or will be used to further a certain propaganda. Is that right?</p>

<p>And as evidence to support your claim (that they use propaganda spiels relative to the six week cycle theory, and this is the next &quot;installment&quot;), you cite the SMMA. Lemme know if ive misunderstood something thus far, as the context is important for me to understand where youre coming from.</p>

<p>If my understandings above are correct, id like for you to start at the beginning of how the SMMA fits into all of this, if you dont mind. (We&#39;ll get into how it relates to the six week cycle soon, i just want to make sure we are on the same page first...)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have misunderstood. The SMMA leads to the &quot;6 week cycle&quot;. The 6 week cycle is a consequence of institutional deceit. It could be a 6 week cycle, a four hour cycle, a fifteen minute cycle depending on what needs to be transmitted and the time frame within which it needs to be transmitted. That a propaganda system is in place and actively used is documented and obvious. Whether reporting on an ebola outbreak is a part of that system is the question posed by my OP.</p>
