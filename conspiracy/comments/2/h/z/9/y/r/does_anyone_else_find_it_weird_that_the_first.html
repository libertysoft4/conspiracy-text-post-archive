        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First i will note that the US has a strong connection with Liberia, so that could be be the reason.</p>

<p>But i just find it odd, that it hasn&#39;t popped up anywhere else yet, like say south Africa, north Africa or even Europe. It just seems odd to me, you would think it would pop up closer to the hot zone, before it pops up inside the US. I mean either its not there yet, or even worse there are people walking around with it, but haven&#39;t gone to the ER or haven&#39;t shown symptoms yet.  </p>

<p>Now for the &quot;conspiracy&quot; side, with all that said, am i the only one that bells are going off in their head over this? I mean with all that airborne strain crap aside, this strain is already spreading fast enough as it is without it being airborne(i <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-the-ebola-virus-will-go-airborne/">dont think it will mutate into a airborne strain</a> either). <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/2hy3r9/science_ama_series_ask_your_questions_about_ebola/">There is a thread going on now</a> in <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a> that is very interesting, but it does raise some concern over the possibility that it could get &quot;bad&quot;, some even recommend using the military to enforce martial law to combat the spread of it.... Rambling now, but we all know the various theories that have come out as what this could be used to do, be it population reduction to inserting martial law country wide. The fact that its popped up first in the US, is what is causing me to re examine those theories, and what led me to write this post.</p>

<p>Not to mention the fact that this guy went to the ER, was released with antibotics, only to come back 2 days later, and then getting diagnosed with Ebola.</p>

<p>So, is this alarming to anyone else? </p>

<p>Ebola should be treated as airborne. Not fearmongering or conspiracy, just the precautionary principle and some evidence. Experimentally, aerosol transmission in monkeys has already been demonstrated, and ultimately we don&#39;t really know the details of how ebola is transmitted.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/infection-prevention-and-control-recommendations.html">http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/infection-prevention-and-control-recommendations.html</a></p>

<p>The CDC recommends adequate face/nose/eye protection for aerosol generating procedures. But aerosols can also be generated when you cough, sneeze, vomit, etc.</p>

<p>I speculate that the reason this strain has become so widespread is that it is airborne and still highly transmissible in the vicinity of the patient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understand what airborne truly is, the case with the monkeys has been grossly over exaggerated. First, it was a completely different strain of Ebola, and second the scientist who was conducting the research thinks it was spread via water vapor. As for your link with use of respirators, that could tell many different stories, but i could see the main reason being that they want workers in a completely quarantined environment themselves, to prevent to them from getting sick(i.e someone sneezing or coughing on them, but that IS NOT AIRBORNE contamination, thats you getting a infected persons bodily fluids on you(i.e saliva), not to mention even then there is a good chance you wont get sick) The fact is, this strain of Ebola doesn&#39;t have a need to mutate to become airborne, as the virus thinks its already spreading at a fast enough rate, obviously it being airborne would be better, but that &quot;little&quot; virus doesn&#39;t understand that, as far as its concerned its doing fine.... Dont take my word for it: <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-the-ebola-virus-will-go-airborne/">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-the-ebola-virus-will-go-airborne/</a> </p>

<p>If it does become airborne, then we know someone(a human) is to blame, because the only real way for it to mutate(not to say it couldn&#39;t) would be for human intervention.</p>

<p>Point being this strain of Ebola isn&#39;t airborne in the classical sense that it can spread like the common cold. Of course if a sick person coughs or sneezes on you, you could get sick, but thats IS NOT AIRBORNE TRANSMISSION. That is you getting the sicks persons bodily fluids on you(saliva), and ten to one you wouldn&#39;t get sick unless they coughed/sneezed a good amount of saliva on you, and directly into your eyes or mouth.... If it was airborne in that sense, you&#39;d see hundreds of thousands sick.</p>

<p>While the possibility exists for this mutation to have occured, or will occur, i believe it would be easier for the virus to mutate in such a way to cause the disease to be contagious prior to symptoms arising, much like influenza. I feel like that could also explain the severity of this particular outbreak.</p>

<p>Thats my speculation, anyhow...</p>

<p>I think this is less likely. The reason that ebola is only transmissible when symptomatic, based on what I understand, is that both symptoms and transmissibility depend on viral load. With more virions there is a greater inflammatory response and more severe symptoms; and with more virions per volume of blood, the more virions other people are exposed to when they come in contact with your blood. The correlation between symptoms and infectiousness is based on the viral load, so it would be pretty hard for a mutation to get around this limitation without reducing mortality.</p>

<p>OTOH, aerosol transmission in monkeys was demonstrated in 1995. So ebola seems to have had this capacity for a while - a mutation that strengthens a characteristic that is already there seems more likely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really sure, but I&#39;d assume it&#39;s because influenza&#39;s symptoms are less severe. So you can have a higher viral load without any symptoms, and by the time you are symptomatic your viral load is high enough to infect other people.</p>

<p>So I would guess that ebola could mutate so that symptoms don&#39;t correlate with infectiousness, but then it would not be such a deadly disease.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess it would require a much more complex mutation in order to retain its severity while introducing presymptomatic contageousness... In that case, i suppose a mutation allowing it to travel through the air more efficiently would be more feasible...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, even in that thread i linked(and other resources), they basically say &quot;Well its hard to actually get infected by just going about your daily life, and interacting with someone who is infected...... BUT on the other hand it is possible&quot;... Obviously the main line medical view is you can only catch it by getting a infected persons bodily fluids in a open wound, your eyes and mouth. But if enough saliva for example(from a infected person) is on a door handle, and you touch it, the virus <em>could</em> live long enough, for you to touch that door handle, get it on your hands, then go eat something with your bare hands(i.e a sandwich) and get/be infected by that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Could</em> --- yes. Especially considering thst theoretically only one virion of ebola is necessary to establish infection. Though i would think the higher end of the range given by the cdc (who claim it takes a minimum of 1-10 virions to establish infection) would be easy enough to spread through contact of infected materials (e.g. door handles). </p>

<p>It all comes down to proper care. Even though ebola can be thwarted by constant hand washing, it is still spread quite easily through contact such as this, especislly when many folks dont wash their hands enough as it is. </p>

<p>And this is where they might &quot;drop the ball.&quot; They have to disinfect all the surfaces he might have infected. And, as winter approaches, this is even more perilous, as ebola virions can survive outside its host on surfaces much longer as the temperstures decrease (and as UV radiation decreases). </p>

<p>Honestly, i am less worried about this case in late september than the ones that could possibly pop up come this winter when temperatures and uv radiation levels are low enough to help facilitate ebolas infectivity to much more dangerous levels..</p>

<p>That should help contain this. I am concerned about mutation as it relates to different forms of transmission, since this is the first case diagnosed outside the diseases home continent of Africa.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am concerned with mutations as well. Particularily one that would cause it to become contagious prior to symptoms arising, much like the flu.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>most definitely. I really don&#39;t want to be ordering masks on Amazon and stocking up on canned goods, food, and ammo, I&#39;m no disaster planner guy. But if this spreads beyond Texas I&#39;m going to be really considering it. New environment, new climate, so much horrific potential.</p>

<p>Random interesting tidbit- one of the Jack Ryan novels by Tom Clancy, Executive Orders, involves a terrorist plot with weaponized airborne ebola. Though that&#39;s just a fear-based tangent I go off on just for funzies... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, im no virologist, but, seeing how ebola can survive longer on surfaces in an environment thsts cold and low UV radiation, i assume that north america would harbor ebola better due to our colder winters. </p>

<p>Where ebola comes from, its hot, with a lot of uv radiation. This would, i would assume, hinder ebolas infectivity. </p>

<p>So, with winter around the corner, if ebola were to spread here now, i would be concerned because it seems like it would survive on contaminated surfaces much, much longer here than in africa. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The scary thing about it too is, a virus can actually spread a whole lot faster in a developed nation because of the huge radius in which we live.  People in African nations might live mostly in a couple mile radius.  Whereas in the USA, you can drive around up to a 15 mile radius in a day; going to work, stopping at the grocery store, picking your kids up, or hopping on a jet for business trip.  That&#39;s a lot of places to be the point of contact for others.  The CDC is dropping the ball on this one IMHO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats a good point. Shit, folks in my area drive an average of like 90miles a day just to get to and from work... Not including grocery stores or picking up the kids or whatever.</p>

<p>Anyway you look at it, its tough to really predict whats gonna happen. On one hand we have a lot of advantages when compared to africa. Then on the other handz there are environmental and cultural differences that may cause us to have disadvantages as well. </p>

<p>Im just sayin, they better not drop the ball. Its containable atm. But honestly, human nature is to fuck up sometimes. Lets hope this isnt one of those times...</p>

<p>Except that appears to be irrelevant:</p>
