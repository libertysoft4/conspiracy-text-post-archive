        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I support free speech, always have, so don&#39;t even try to pin that &#39;censorhip&#39; tag on me.  I&#39;ve been around.  Long time member, big time contributor, check me all you want.</p>

<p>If you want to have a documentary about hitler, go ahead.  There should be a free and open discussion with a vigorous uncensored debate.  I&#39;m all about that.  I&#39;m all about airing controversial material.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t about that.  This is about not intentionally shooting yourself in the foot when you don&#39;t have to.</p>

<p><strong>People who browse reddit at work could get fired</strong>  People who browse at cyber-cafes or libraries could get kicked out.  Yes I understand that it&#39;s legal to look at pictures of hitler and it doesn&#39;t make you a nazi for doing so but we need to be realistic.  This is like intentionally wearing the wrong gang colors in the wrong neighborhood.  Just because you aren&#39;t a gang member and it just happens to be your favorite color doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a good idea.  Should anyone feel unsafe for wearing a t-shirt?  Of course not.  But practical considerations must be made.</p>

<p><strong>This week is Rosh Hashana, an important Jewish holiday</strong>.  By posting the hitler picture, you are asking for trouble that you don&#39;t need to ask for.  Again, keep the documentary, keep the sticky post, keep the discussion.  Just don&#39;t plaster nazi logos on <strong>every single page in the subreddit</strong>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not just a complainer.  I can&#39;t stand people who complain and don&#39;t offer an alternative.  I have prepared this <a href="http://i.imgur.com/mRnrZeo.png">alternative image</a>.  It&#39;s not great, it took me a minute to make, and someone else could do better, but it will do for now.</p>

<p><strong>There has been a recent influx of new users</strong> and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that, but a lot of them are doing nothing more than cause trouble.  Again, I&#39;m not new here.  Neither are many other users who take this very seriously.  I&#39;ve been around and I care about this place. </p>

<p><strong>We can have free speech without painting ourselves as nazis</strong>.  I don&#39;t want to hear any pedantic nitpicking about how it&#39;s just a picture, or other historical figures were just as bad.  This is primarily an American site, and there is a cultural context to that image in America.</p>

<p>Can we debate that cultural context?  Absolutely.  Does that mean we need to put a picture of hitler on every page of the subreddit.  Fuck no.</p>

<p><strong>The picture causes more harm than good.</strong></p>

<p>If we could only talk about WW2 when it wasn&#39;t near a Jewish holiday we wouldn&#39;t ever be allowed to talk about it. Take your political correctness and reserve it for yourself, don&#39;t project your views onto a open minded all topics on the table forum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can talk about it all you want.  On any day of the year.  I haven&#39;t seen the documentary in question, and I was not attacking the documentary.  I didn&#39;t vote in that thread or any of the documentary threads so I can&#39;t complain that it won.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to put a picture of hitler on every page of the subreddit to do that.  You can have the discussion without the picture.  The picture doesn&#39;t contribute anything to the discussion, but it does take away a lot.</p>

<p>Images matter, perceptions matter.  Free speech doesn&#39;t mean speech is free from critique.  Timing matters, tact matters.  The mods made a big mistake by putting that image on the sidebar.  You can have a thorough debate about WWII without using that image.  You can promote the documentary.  You can even take the side of the nazis (and I will oppose you).  But when you plaster nazi logos all over a subreddit that I and many others take very seriously you aren&#39;t helping yourself or anyone else.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is NOT a nazi subreddit.  You can talk about the nazis, but don&#39;t go telling everyone this is nazi headquarters.  Plastering that image sends the wrong message.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The documentary doesn&#39;t glorify the racist aspects of the Nazi party.  Watching just the first hour, though, gave me a context and helped me finally make some sense of WWII and the motives of the German people.  I was literally never told about the motives until now.  I was never exposed to an attempt at an explanation as to why the movement was so racist and commit to genocide of the hebrew people.  I didn&#39;t understand how much WWII had to do with WWI.  You can call me uninformed all you want, but I did fine and high school and college.  My education would never have exposed me to these thoughts and I plan on going and watching more of it right now.  This film, if anything for me so far, has highlighted the extreme danger in targeting a group of people and holding them all accountable for the actions of their leadership.  If you can&#39;t even bring yourself to start the film, then I propose you take a look in the mirror and ask yourself whether or not you&#39;re too inundated with propaganda to question events that happened before your birth.</p>

<p>This is just a person who judges books by their covers trying to defend a book he likes but hates its current weekly cover and has to correct this problem because he feels everyone thinks the way he does and will jump to conclusions about what the content of the sub is by the picture on the sidebar and that will then project him as pro nazi when he is so adamantly not as he feels the need to say as if anyone accused him otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, I re-examined OP&#39;s argument.  As someone impassioned about freedom of speech.  He&#39;s actually correct in some ways.  There could easily be a different image for the documentary, a lot less potentially free minds goofing off at work would be reprimanded over it.  A lot of people are stupid, we&#39;d be doing the people who work for them a favor.  I will say, though, that as someone in the service industry, the thought of someone in IT making more than me and getting to surf <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> at work really pisses me off.  So when I come home and read it in the privacy of my own home, I really don&#39;t give a shit about appearances.  It was in this mindset that I passionately disagreed with OP (I deleted some of my own arguments), but I&#39;d say as long as the film is still the voted in film, we could alter the image to one that grabs less knee-jerk attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Strictly speaking you are either breaking the rules at work and should be reprimanded or you aren&#39;t and they would have to revise the companies policy on non-work internet usage to make it clear what is acceptable and what is not. Nuance is not something you have to worry about if you get fired and it was based on nuance you get to sue the company. HR departments and internet usage policies exist to remove this situation from being a matter of &quot;nuance.&quot;</p>

<p>This picture is Safe for work, if you work for a company with a no filter no policy non-work related internet policy go to town, abuse the sh*t out of it all you want. If you are worried that you may be breaking the rules go ask HR, again they are paid to answer these questions to remove &quot;nuance&quot; from the situation, or use the tools available to everyone to remove unwanted images from the sidebar. As I said RES works automatically for me and simply turning of subreddit style does this for you w/o download.</p>

<p><strong>As for the image provoking these kinds of reactions, I do believe that was the entire point of the image.</strong> This is a doc discussing some of the craziest times in human history, if it didn&#39;t provoke a reaction then it wouldn&#39;t be worth having an open mind and wondering why it is we live in a society where you worry about getting fired over an image of something(not the symbol of nazism, thats the swastika) when the topic you actually should be worried about is that you find it socially acceptable to jack off at work, as long as an image of what resembles Hitler isn&#39;t on the sidebar.</p>

<p>For your help, other things you could be getting paid at work to do instead of reading r/cons:</p>

<p>Learn a foreign language.
Study for a better education so you can get paid more, &quot;hey boss I&#39;ve been using my downtime at work to further my ability to bring profit to the company think I could get a raise?&quot;
Watch cat videos, at least then you won&#39;t have to worry about any &quot;nuance&quot; right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I wasn&#39;t going to waste time defending myself to you, but since this acct is somewhat tied to myself I feel compelled to explain things to you.</p>

<p>First of all fuck you for trying to tell others what to do. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t know me. </p>

<p>Second of all, I&#39;ve put in my time. I&#39;m a fucking adult that started working at the fucking age of 13, waking up at 4:30 am EVERY fucking day of the year to deliver papers from my bike before school. Then, at 16, when I could LEGALLY get a real job I worked at a sandwich shop afterschool and weekends while my friends went and did fun things. Then, I continued to work to put myself to college, now, 20 years later, I&#39;m at the top of my profession in a field severely lacking in finding American talent and with that comes perks.</p>

<p>Again, you obviously are not familiar with my industry.</p>

<p>As for your &quot;lazy&quot; insult and &quot;integrity&quot; comment. I don&#39;t lie or misrepresent myself, my boss and his boss are aware and expect it. Also, I don&#39;t work hourly and may sometimes work from home until 3am on a deadline or demo. Trust me, the company is getting honest work, probably more then out of an old ignorant prude like you.</p>

<p>PS - I am going to have to go source it, but a reputable study was done showing that browsing the web at work actually increased productivity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know...  I gave it some thought as to whether I&#39;d actually rebut or not, but I have one simple question for you right now, being what exactly do you do for a living?  I&#39;ll gladly explain to you my career in return, and maybe then we can see why I might perhaps be a bit bitter about this subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this post is a joke.  I think jobs where people get to play on computers all day are a joke.  I don&#39;t mind at all about the sidebar picture.  I do mind that there are low class individuals out there who get paid more money than most laborers do to sit around and play with computers all day except for when they have to troubleshoot (unplug and replug a modem/router/printer/etc).  I do mind that there are honest, hard working people out there slaving away for scraps.  Without people like me no one would eat.  Without people like me life would be a lot more difficult on every person alive.  Sweating all day fabricating food processing equipment for bare bones money while computer guys get paid 8 hours to work for 30 minutes a day.  That in itself is a damn conspiracy.  /rant.  No, I&#39;m not sorry.</p>

Looking at WWII in a different light isn&#39;t turning us all into crazy people.  If you want to censor this, you don&#39;t belong here.  Get off my lawn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly!  It&#39;s literally not safe for work.  Having a picture of hitler on your screen could get you <strong>fired</strong>.  Management is not understanding.</p>

<p>I am not advocating any censorship of any speech about WWII.  I don&#39;t have a problem with porn either, but that doesn&#39;t mean we should put artistic nudes on sidebar either.  I&#39;m all for free speech and truth seeking but the mods messed up big time here.  </p>
