    <div class="md"><p>It should be done.  Replace these corporate retards with real people.  If ever those real people become corrupted by money they should be terminated as well.  I think it&#39;s a great idea, and the first two removed should be Nancy Pelosi and John McCain.  Ideally all 535 congressional members should be ousted at once but an example deserves to be made of these two in particular.  I feel they represent equally the corruption of both political parties and their dismissal should be made a display.  Once we rid our government of the puppets we implement a no party system with no special beliefs attached and no special interests involved.  Any corporation or entity of any kind attempting to taint the new system with bribery and the like should be posed with sanctions and penalties to the highest degree.  There should be term limits for the Legislative and Judicial branches of government along with the Executive branch.  I&#39;m ready to try this.  Let&#39;s do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people still aren&#39;t consciousnessly able to process this sort of data about their government let alone the political party that they favor. A lot of people have belief in authority and the powers that govern them as a sort of lynch pin in their psyche. Part of how they raise their kids, sit in traffic, watch bullshit tv etc every single part of these daily lives are underpinned by that idea that the world is governed by people who know what they are doing.</p>

<p>This belief allows people to focus on other things in their daily lives. They can divorce themselves from the macroscale and focus merely on the microcosm right in front of their faces. A lot of people are deeply innurred to this way of thinking and if you blow the doors of it many of them would undergo a psychotic break. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really a lot like the matrix. I&#39;m not sure how to break people out of it or even if we should. All I know is that I personally want to be free and I observe many others say they do as well. But never enough of us to command those who merely wish to follow.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll never get anywhere attacking the government. They can lie, cheat and murder all they want and for most of the world it will just go down the memory hole if it was known/processed by the individual at all in the first place.</p>

<p>There is a way out but you won&#39;t find it in politics or even in revolution. The best case scenario with revolution is that you get to become the masters yourselves instead of being ruled by others. But you haven&#39;t created freedom. You&#39;ve just taken over.</p>

<p>I agree but there is nothing productive we can do about that. They won&#39;t reform themselves. We can&#39;t push reform though with elections that we don&#39;t control. Etc etc. Nothing short of a massive tax revolt or a revolution is going to put the US temporarily back into the hands of its people. And as I said before those roads just lead to changing the bosses at best. It does not eliminate the oppression.</p>

<p>But in your words what is freedom? Or is freedom a farce?</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">2</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/[deleted].html">[deleted]</a> 2014-09-23</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Freedom isn&#39;t a farce. But it&#39;s also not easy to put into words. I think that is because true freedom isn&#39;t even a physical thing. I shall essay my best on this matter for my own benefit as much as others</p>

<p>Freedom means being able to do the things you need to do to survive without unnatural constraint or compulsion. One cannot exist physically on the world without some form of constraint or compulsion. I am constrained by gravity from flying and I am compelled by my body to seek food. </p>

<p>These are naturally occurring properties of my universe and my body. They are the rules of being incarnate on this world. Rules written into the universe and my body itself. Maybe they were or maybe they were not written by a divine consciousness but they are the rules none the less. </p>

<p>But not all constraint or compulsions are natural. Is it natural that I must seek employment on bended knee from an employer class to receive payment in paper to exchange for goods and services? Is it natural that if I fail to do this but seek to support myself by other means that I must then go to jail or die? Is that natural or is that a product of society? </p>

<p>One can argue that society is a natural thing. It is after all created by humanity, another natural thing. However it seems that when a society is created it has one set of values and rules. But as each generation within the society dies it seems more and more to fall into the power of a ruler class. A group whose will is made manifest on the society more strongly with each generation. </p>

<p>And so even though society may be a natural thing it eventually becomes a man-made thing. And not even a thing made by the majority. But merely a construct through which the few rule the many. A construct into which we are born as bond-slaves, generation after generation. Compelled to give our energy and labor in exchange for paper or &quot;computer credits&quot; with which we must then deal with other members of the rich class. We must turn over our spent-energy chits to them in exchange for our necessities. We will live our whole lives at a disadvantage with these rich people.</p>

<p>I think that true freedom would be the right to opt out of this system and pursue a more natural way of obtaining survival. There used to be such a thing as common land that people shared to set up gardens for themselves and to hunt on. This meant that a man could survive all of his days without ever having to wear the yoke of a master. </p>

<p>I think that to be truly free, or as free as a person can be, they must be able to opt out of society and opt their whole family out. There needs to be an alternative to the spent energy chit economy. There needs to be another way to survive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply, I really enjoy your prose.

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. I swear you are not on your own. I know a lot of people who want this common land. In fact if I can ever get a piece of decent land clear and legal the first thing I will do is bundle it into a common charter containing rules like, &quot;nothing can be sold from the land without unanimous consent&quot; or &quot;all land management decisions are to be considered in the full group meeting before any sort of independent council gets involved.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t exactly have all of the ideas completely sorted out. I had intended  these rules to be created by a ruling council of folks ready to go out and make a village/tribe on that land. So that&#39;s why it isn&#39;t completely put together but also because it is most likely a pipe dream. I survive month to month on my petty wages and we barely even do that.</p>

<p>I just know that what fucks up most communes is that somebody owns the land and expects everybody else to be their serfs. I&#39;ve seen it over and over again. A commune only works when everybody owns everything. </p>
