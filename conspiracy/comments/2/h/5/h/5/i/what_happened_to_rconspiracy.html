The articles and videos can, most the time, be backed up by fact and sources. The discussions are usually compelling and with strong arguments for both sides that keep you thinking open-mindedly. </p>

<p>All I see now are sensationalized headlines, discussions turning into instant circlejerks, tons of pictures boasting statistics with nothing to back it up. </p>

<p>What happened?</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks everybody for your input. I got a lot more answers than I thought I would. The main one seems to be &quot;stop being a lurker and contribute instead of complaining about nothing good being posted.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Waves of trolls do occasionally pop up.  Then there&#39;s people who may have good intentions but just aren&#39;t that smart or don&#39;t understand what this sub is for.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s better to have too little moderation than too much, lest the mods be accused of censoring.  Reward the good posts with upvotes and comments, downvote and ignore the bad.</p>

<p>I also must note.  One of these &quot;What&#39;s happening to conspiracy&quot; posts shows up at least once a week.  They don&#39;t really help anything and take slots away from actual content.  They can be disheartening to users who take this seriously.  I noticed that the OP of this one hasn&#39;t really contributed to this sub as far as I can tell, and admits to being a lurker. </p>

<p>Lurking is fine, but contributing is better.  Complaining without contributing looks like <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/concern_troll">concern trolling</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Internet slang) Someone who posts to an internet forum or newsgroup, claiming to share its goals while deliberately working against those goals, typically, by claiming &quot;concern&quot; about group plans to engage in productive activity, urging members instead to attempt some activity that would damage the group&#39;s credibility, or alternatively to give up on group projects entirely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not calling out OP to pick a fight, but remember this is a community.  If things aren&#39;t up to your standards a little effort to make positive contributions can go a long way.  Some of us put a lot of time and effort into this and take our work very seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but if this subreddit is as inundated with trolls and shills as people suggest then good posts are going to get downvoted and bad posts are going to be upvoted quite quickly. One of the reasons I frequent the &quot;new&quot; area so often. I figure it&#39;s the only chance I have for the most part of catching good shit before it&#39;s downvoted to hell. I don&#39;t know how true any of this is, but it&#39;s the best method for avoiding what I suspect may be an issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. Maybe criticize later, when you&#39;re better informed? Communities about... <em>delicate</em> topics such as this one are bound to be a bit tempestuous and plagued with trolls, and certainly not everyone here agrees on everything.</p>

<p>So complaining about the quality of submissions declining is pretty damn unhelpful, because it&#39;s not like everyone on this sub got together and voted that the sub should be flooded with shitposts.</p>

<p>Calling the sub itself into question over it is <em>extremely</em> counterproductive. Arguably trollish.</p>

It&#39;s posts like these that help maintain the integrity of this sub. I mean isn&#39;t that what this sub is all about, questioning everything? And what do you mean it&#39;s taking up a slot from &quot;actual content&quot;? How does this hurt anything at all?

    <div class="md"><p>Less whining, more contributing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not discouraging anyone from asking questions.  <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is <strong>all about</strong> asking questions that usually aren&#39;t asked.  But if all one is asking is &quot;why isn&#39;t this sub the way I want it to be?&quot; then they&#39;re really just complaining.  And by the way,  the answer is because you haven&#39;t done anything to contribute.</p>

<p>The integrity of this sub is maintained by high quality posts.  There are people that work hard on trying to maintain a standard of quality.  If your question is &quot;why are there some bad posts&quot;, the answer is a tolerant moderation policy, which I will defend.</p>

<p>There is no &quot;king or r/conspiracy&quot; that owes anyone any kind of explanation for why posts aren&#39;t to their liking.</p>

<p>This is a community.  It doesn&#39;t exist without it&#39;s members and posters.  Honestly, I think we&#39;re doing great.  To all of those that know what we&#39;re about and have that genuine thirst for truth, you know who you are.  Keep going and never give up.   </p>

<p>EDIT: I think I&#39;ve made my point in my first.  There&#39;s just no pleasing some people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my opinion.</p>

<p>Things became black and white.</p>

<p>It used to be &quot;hey look at what I found, can anyone prove or disprove this?&quot; </p>

<p>People would join the DISCUSSION and post evidence for or against a submission. The audience would look at things objectively and the sub as a whole would either embrace or debunk something.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s an us against them mentality. If you&#39;re not jumping onboard with something the burden of proof is on you, not the OP. If you don&#39;t agree you must be a shill. It&#39;s some sort neo-mcarthyism mentality. I just feel like there&#39;s no middle ground anymore. We&#39;ve developed this culture of fear in our country that spreads like an infection. It&#39;s ok to question everything , here, the MSM, what the guy at work said etc. It&#39;s ok to be wrong or disagree. Just because you don&#39;t believe in UFO&#39;s doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t believe that the CIA is running drugs or vice versa. I don&#39;t believe that there&#39;s a reptillian agenda, that everything in the MSM is a false flag and I also believe that the MSM pushes a govt written agenda on a lot of issues.</p>

<p>Let me just use fracking as an example, I&#39;ve worked in oil and run wells right after they come online. I&#39;ve been on a lot of active fracking sites. Those people setting their water on fire, could probably have set it on fire pre frack. Is there nasty shit going down the well, yep there&#39;s a lot of acid and other descaling agents. But it&#39;s mainly water, sand, guar gum(emulsifier also used in the food you eat) , clay and potassium. A lot of potassium. But I&#39;ve never seen an anti fracking group post results showing the acids,guar gum or increased potassium in these water wells. I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s not data out there showing it, I just haven&#39;t run across it. Is big oil bad, fuck yes but not for all the reasons they&#39;re pushing. It&#39;s bad because if we keep ramping up production oil prices will go down, it&#39;s bad because they&#39;re finding wells that &quot;recharge&quot; sort of validating the abiotic oil theory(if it&#39;s not scarce you won&#39;t pay a high price for it...just like diamonds), it&#39;s bad because we could be self sufficient but our corporations choose to sell crude on the foreign markets because it&#39;s more profitable. But if I try to call someone out on flaming tap water I&#39;m a shill for the oil companies.</p>

<p>A diamonds true value lies in its hardness. The monetary value of diamonds is a sham. One simply has to look at <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/diamond-de-beers-marketing-campaign">the  DeBeers marketing campaign.</a></p>

<p>As for oil, its value lays in its necessity in the modern world. Its monetary value is based on the US-$Dollar. Look up the petrol-dollar, and its status as the world&#39;s currency reserve. </p>

<p>if you filter by top instead of hot or any other filter, the top thread has 1900 votes, thats prob a realistic percentage of the real people here, maybe 50% of the number visiting over the previous four days.</p>

<p>so 5% or 10% of the 250K might be a good ballpark guesstimate as to the numbers of real people.</p>

<p>&quot;a pretty insane jump in logic&quot;</p>

<p>to assume there are NOT people with a paid agenda downvoting threads that touch on sensitive topics.</p>

<p>its possible to conversant with shills occasionally on quiet times, if you are tactful and don&#39;t outright swear and cuss them for their trade.</p>

<p>I recently postulated to one obvious shill about the status and ethics of being one, the concept of selling lies for money, how could one sleep well at night doing such a job.</p>

<p>he/she replied with &quot;I hear it pays well&quot;</p>

<p>and PS, its not up to us to prove a plane hit the Pentagon, we never said or claimed one did, your masters tried to sell us the story a plane went boom into the audit office there (the day after Rumsfeld announced the $2.3T accounting hole of ten years), its up to your masters to prove a submarine plane flew partially through the ground to make ONLY an initial 15&#39; hole in the ground floor. nice pristine lawn you have there !?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.killtown.911review.org/pentalawn.html">Penta-lawn 2000</a> the amazing airliner proof lawn for the 21st century.</p>
