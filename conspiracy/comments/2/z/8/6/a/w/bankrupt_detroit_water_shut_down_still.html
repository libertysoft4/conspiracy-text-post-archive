        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;As evidence and studies continue to mount against public water fluoridation, cities that continue to do so risk individual legal action for damages and human rights violations for force-medicating. In Detroit, after becoming the largest American city to file for bankruptcy, there is a move to quickly begin water shutoffs to “protect the city’s budget.” </p>

<p><em>Yet there is still money to be found by the city to purchase hydrofluorosilicic acid (fluoride) from private companies to add to the water supply. In fact, it’s mandated by Detroit city ordinance</em>:</p>

<p>“§ 56-2-58 Authorized. The board of water commissioners, in cooperation with the department of health of the city, is hereby authorized and directed to institute fluoridation of the water supply of the city and to do all things necessary to carry out the directive set forth in this section.”
Violating Human Rights</p>

<p>Detroit, labeled a ‘corporate sacrificed city’ by author Chris Hedges, became ground zero for public frustration in 2014 when a judge ruled to begin shutting off water to roughly 3000 homes per week. This move was halted when international attention came from the work of the Detroit Water Brigade and The Wave Fund, causing the United Nations to label the situation a violation of human rights.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s why they&#39;re still doing it then. They can&#39;t break the law. They will have to keep doing it until the law is changed.</p>

<p>Apparently there&#39;s no law on the books that they need to keep supplying water to addresses that have stopped paying for it.</p>

<p>No law, but at least someone&#39;s standing up for the poor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that in general municipalities won&#39;t spend money on stuff unless they have to (unless it&#39;s kickbacks). Think of all the other things they could add to water for whatever reason, but they don&#39;t. Just the mandated fluoride.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That seems to be true of many laws that mandate the government purchase stuff. But it doesn&#39;t change the conversation. The city has to keep fluoridating water because it&#39;s legally mandated.</p>

I&#39;m from and we&#39;ve put ourselves in a position where we have to follows laws knowing they&#39;re harmful to the people that live there because we needed the flow of money revenue and to line some peoples pockets also stating that there may have been some behind the door agreements like with Jennifer Granholm&#39;s brother (Probably Butchered Her Name lol). What sucks even more is the knowing and pure ignorance of the people in Detroit who basically have given up and dont care and only want to be saved.</p>

<p>Therein lies the problem. The opposite would be that the city would ignore ordinances and do whatever it wants. That would be a bigger conspiracy. </p>

<p>This is one of those paradoxes that tin hatters like to create, damn if you do, damn if you don&#39;t. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>The opposite can also be true, that people whose teeth start rotting out of their heads can also sue. </p>
