<p>lots of famous Americans (Ford, Disney) supported/funded the nazi&#39;s. I think that maybe at the time communism was much more of a threat to the westerns way of life, so once the national-socialist party took control of Germany everyone jumped aboard to support them considering how well communism worked out for the Russians under the Bolsheviks. </p>

<p>I believe the driver was involved, in some respect, but I don&#39;t think he was a shooter. I&#39;ve seen the videos suggesting he was but none of it has convinced me so far. I think he was culpable of slowing down to make sure the kill shot was as easy as possible for the snipers, and checking over his shoulder to make sure it had happened, but I don&#39;t buy into him being a trigger man himself</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody is bothered because of  this :-</p>

<p>The six grand illusions that keep us enslaved to the Matrix</p>

<p>The Illusion of Law, Order and Authority - The social order is not what it seems, for it is entirely predicated on conformity, obedience and acquiescence which are enforced by fear of violence. The pomp and trappings of authority are merely a concealment of the truth that the current world order is predicated on control, not consent.</p>

<pre><code>The Illusion of Prosperity and Happiness - Adorning oneself in expensive clothes and trinkets ... became a substitute for genuine prosperity. [T]he illusion of prosperity is critical to our economy because its foundation is built on consumption, fraud, credit and debt. True prosperity is a vibrant environment and an abundance of health, happiness, love, and relationships.

The Illusion of Choice and Freedom - Just look no further than the phony institution of modern democracy to find a shining example of false choices appearing real. A powerful oppressor because it fools us into accepting chains and short leashes as though they were the hallmarks of liberty.

The Illusion of Truth - In order to maintain order, the powers that be depend on our acquiescence to their version of the truth. While independent thinkers and journalists continually blow holes in the official versions of reality, the illusion of truth is so very powerful that it takes a serious personal upheaval to shun the cognitive dissonance needed to function in a society that openly chases false realities.

The Illusion of Time - They say that time is money, but this is a lie. Time is your life. Your life is an ever-evolving manifestation of the now. The big deception here is the reinforcement of the idea that the present moment is of little to no value. Once completely focused on what is to come rather than what is, we are easy prey to advertisers and fear-pimps who muddy our vision of the future with every possible worry and concern imaginable.

The Illusion of separateness - The tactic of divide and conquer is standard operating procedure for authoritarians and invading armies. As individuals we are in competition with everyone and everything around us, including our neighbours and even mother nature. Us vs. them to the extreme. This flatly denies the truth that life on this planet is infinitely inter-connected.

<p>You don&#39;t get to vote on it or have a say in it.  You can influence unimportant matters all you want, but your right to determine your own destiny has been stolen from you in the name of &quot;national security&quot;.</p>

<p>It happened to me when i watched micheal moores farenheit 9/11 and the beautiful music played while he showed all the democratically elected leaders after being shot by the cia.</p>

<p>That and reading the operations northwooods document. Once you see them discussing downing airplanes full of americans to make it look like cuba did it so they can invade you realize there is nothing these people wont do. Nothing menas shooting the presidentt jfk - who told them to stop.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t mischaracterize this by accident.  They don&#39;t &quot;run everything&quot;.  That would be impossible.  They have formed alliances all over the globe.</p>

<p>Need to produce some passports for fake &quot;terrorists&quot;?  Just use your Saudi contacts that live in a relatively closed society on the other side of the world.  You did, after all, funnel weapons and training to them to create the security apparatus for your friends in exchange for oil and cooperation.  Heck!  They even jokingly called the head of Saudi intelligence &quot;Bandar Bush.&quot;</p>

<p>The Bush family filled the void that Allen Dulles left.  He and Prescott were very close.  Dulles had no children, so he could have a progeny in GHW and, in return, GHW would use his new power and knowledge to favor his father&#39;s (and his friends) business interests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh look... Chrisbooth12... good to see you again.  Did you just start your shift or do you work on flex hours?</p>

<p>What does him being &quot;black sheeped&quot; have fuck all to do with anything?  Furthermore, you can&#39;t actually provide proof that the claim is meaningful or actually true in any way.</p>

<p>Is there any issue you can&#39;t try to strawman?</p>

<p>Seriously.. you need to fuck off and stop trolling here with your garbage.  I encourage any user to spend two seconds reviewing his comment history and you will find post after post defending every government approved narrative out there.  </p>

<p>When you know you can&#39;t disprove the facts, the best you can do is distract from the core issue, huh?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why does this subreddit love the word strawman so much? I just pointed out something. Just because someone is a member of a family and he did something doesn&#39;t mean the whole family is at fault now does it? I don&#39;t have a horse in this race. Just pointed something out. I am not defending anything or refuting anything. Just pointing something out.</p>

<p>Go through my post history and find the last time I said the word &quot;strawman&quot;.... I fucking dare you.</p>

<p>It&#39;s convenient how your version of &quot;the truth&quot; is always in sync with every government narrative.  Seriously... fuck off... people are tiring of being purposely deceived.  Maybe you should do something productive with your life.</p>

<p>That may work on some, but people are becoming more and more aware of dickholes like you.  I have seen your name a lot and have never seen you contribute anything of substance.  You aren&#39;t honest about why you are here.  You never stray from the official position unless it is an issue of no consequence.</p>

<p>The bin laden family funded the japanese architect who buitl the world trade towers . He had just helped rebuild mecca.</p>

<p>The towers had arabic arches at the bottom and the plaza was meant to reseemble mecca with two minaretts.</p>

<p>Its likely bin laden had precise building plans for the world rade center towers.</p>
