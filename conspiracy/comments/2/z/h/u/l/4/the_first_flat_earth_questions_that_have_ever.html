<p>Well today I stumbled upon an interview with a person who claims to be a former NASA artist who was tasked with doing mock ups of photos for them.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cQt9vq3sdtQ">https://youtu.be/cQt9vq3sdtQ</a></p>

<p>Around the 11 minute mark he made some claims that gave me pause and I&#39;d like to hear what you guys think.</p>

<p>His questions were all in regards to photos of the earth from space.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why is the ocean so blue? </p></li>
<li><p>If the ocean is blue because it is reflecting the atmosphere, why are the land masses not also tinted blue?</p></li>
<li><p>If the water is reflecting the colour of the atmosphere, why can we not see any of the blackness of space reflected back?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Maybe there are some really simple answers to these questions but I&#39;d like to hear them, but that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking you guys!
Thanks</p>

<p>The ocean is blue for the same reason the sky is blue: refraction and diffraction of incident light.</p>

<p>After all, the reason the sky is blue is not that the Sun is blue.  This whole post is based on equally immature fake reasoning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That makes sense, if the initial premise is wrong then so would the subsequent questions. Thanks. I&#39;m still trying to wrap my head around this though. Why is it that the ocean and sky appear blue but there isn&#39;t a blue tint or blue look to the land masses? Would the light coming from them not also be diffracted?</p>

<p>EDIT: Also if you go to the end of the clip he references the diffraction/refraction of light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope,this is why I am asking! Thanks, and what you&#39;ve said makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>I wish my understanding of some basic scientific principals was better, but this is the kind of stuff I&#39;d snore through back in school.</p>

<p>So it sounds like it&#39;s really the light in the oceans that is being tinted blue by the water light passing through the water. The atmosphere is not having much of an effect as the land masses show so clearly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s pretty much right.  It&#39;s also worth noting that the blue light in the atmosphere tends to be deflected by the diffraction, and the blue light is directed horizontally, so a satellite will not see much blue light in the atmosphere.  Most of the light incident on the ocean is absorbed in the ocean, but a large fraction of what&#39;s re-radiated will be blue.</p>

<p>Can you explain a bit more? Wouldn&#39;t the light coming from the land masses also go through the air and thus be refracted/diffracted? Or do we only see this through the water and not the atmosphere? (since I guess everything is equally affected by the atmosphere when looking from outside)</p>

<p>A clear cloudless day-time sky is blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light. When we look towards the sun at sunset, we see red and orange colours because the blue light has been scattered out and away from the line of sight.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm...I still feel like this means the light coming from the land masses should also be blue tinted to a degree. It has to pass through the atmosphere to get to the camera, no?</p>

<p>Of course they might just touch it up in editing, but that&#39;s the main reason these types of theories exist, people see deception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like landmasses would appear blue if they were air particles but they have solidness which has its own color. Plus it&#39;s probably gotta be quite a long distance for all the air particles put together to appear blue (but that&#39;s just my opinion)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I ran across a video a few weeks back about how the math used to calculate various planetary things shows that the earth is its center; that we aren&#39;t moving.  Obviously, that doesn&#39;t jive with what&#39;s already written in the text books, and certain agendas, so that information is suppressed, and possibly why some key scientists are losing their lives.  But, anyway, the first time I was tripped up by the flat earth thing was just recently when I was asking why people don&#39;t fall off.  Huh? If the earth is flat why haven&#39;t we found the edge of it? huh? huh? and it was explained to me that it&#39;s more like a cd, or a record spinning and the edges are at the north and the south.  I&#39;m still processing that information. It&#39;s difficult when your belief system is challenged so completely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  I can&#39;t quite wrap my head around how there could be an edge when you can get &quot;there&quot; from &quot;here&quot; without falling off.  Now, the geo-centric thing is a little more difficult to just dismiss.  (i think that&#39;s what they call it). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first time I really said &quot;hey... wait a minute...&quot; was when my brother started  blathering on about how the moon landing was faked.  I laughed right at him, but then looked into to so I could laugh at him some more, but now... yeah, no moon landing.  That lead me to question a lot of other things.  Personally, I don&#39;t think space is what we&#39;ve been told it is, I don&#39;t believe in the mars thing, or the landing on the comet thing, none of it.

<p>I do wonder why you don&#39;t see the earth&#39;s curvature more when you go up that high and why they always seem to use super wide angle lenses to give the look of the earth curving.
I don&#39;t think I have enough info to doubt the explanation that the curve is just so shallow you need to be FAR away before really noticing it.</p>

<p>Yes I actually just watched this earlier one and personally I expected to be able to see the curvature more, but I understand the earth is huge and this may not be the case. (hopefully you can understand I&#39;m really trying not to let any preconception colour my opinion either way)</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t ever seen a video that actually showed the curvature as anything significant. I don&#39;t know if this is because they just didn&#39;t go high enough. The one with the weather baloon seemed really high.</p>

<p>The map would look something like <a href="http://wiki.tfes.org/images/4/43/Map.png">this.</a>  I made a post about it a week or two ago but Antarctica is incredibly unique in that a great many countries have a great many bases and outposts there, any visits anywhere on the continent need to be pre-approved months in advance and you can only visit one relatively small section of it, there is no civilian presence there at all, etc.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s true, but it&#39;s an interesting idea either way and one I don&#39;t immediately dismiss - especially in light of how negative of a reaction it always gets whenever questions like these are asked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It only gets a negative reaction because it challenges someone&#39;s reality and people are very much afraid to be ridiculed as being backwards.  I have a difficult time dismissing it out of hand because I don&#39;t believe the moon landings happened anymore and because of the things you mention here.  I truly believe that I may just be living in a matrix situation. </p>

<p>I&#39;m with you here, in fact I&#39;d go so far as to say that in my mind there isn&#39;t any doubt whatsoever that the Apollo missions were total BS from top to bottom.  <em>If</em> we ever went to the Moon (and that&#39;s an enormous if), it certainly wasn&#39;t the way they told us we did.</p>

<p>But you&#39;re right, if <em>that&#39;s</em> a lie what else is?  &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; was invented by a Jesuit priest for instance.  The &quot;Copernican Principle&quot; is (to this day!) an unproven theory that probably 90% of the world or more just takes as a given fact.  Numerous holes have been poked in some of both Einstein&#39;s and Newton&#39;s theories, despite much of &quot;modern science&quot; being based around them in part or in full, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Agreed, though I think the technology Apollo claimed to have used was insufficient regardless of the Van Allen Belts.  The amount of fuel that would&#39;ve been required to get to the Moon and back (and how much it would necessarily weigh) alone is enough to prove their story BS.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s Wernher von Braun talking about the type of rocket that would be needed to actually reach the Moon:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is commonly believed that man will fly directly from the earth to the moon, but to do this, we would require a vehicle of such gigantic proportions that it would prove an economic impossibility. It would have to develop sufficient speed to penetrate the atmosphere and overcome the earth’s gravity and, having traveled all the way to the moon, it must still have enough fuel to land safely and make the return trip to earth. Furthermore, in order to give the expedition a margin of safety, we would not use one ship alone, but a minimum of three … each rocket ship would be taller than New York’s Empire State Building and weigh about ten times the tonnage of the Queen Mary, or some 800,000 tons.</p>
