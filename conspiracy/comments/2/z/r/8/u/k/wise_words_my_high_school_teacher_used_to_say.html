<p>There&#39;s a flaw. By singling out religion, people forget the obvious replacement that fulfills the historical role of religion:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t really need to say it, religion is kept out of the government schools. Remember the school prayer debate frenzy of years gone by?&#39;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/19/school-prayer_n_3461479.html">School Prayer 50 Years Later: What Do Americans Believe?</a></p>

<p>My point isn&#39;t that we should have religious practices in government schools, it&#39;s simply pointing out that if you control the education of generations of young people, then eventually certain modes of thinking will become very scarce or nonexistent.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a lot of trust to put in one institution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am so incredibly grateful for my high school history teacher.  Mine always said &quot;Those who don&#39;t learn from history, are doomed to repeat it.&quot; and &quot;History is always written by the victors.&quot;  He would advise us not to jump to conclusions about what we hear in the media. He also made it clear that certain movies we were forced to watch like Schindler&#39;s list and Amistad are just fictional piece based on history, and in order to get the real full story we should actually research the subject.  I was disappointed when he retired shortly after I graduated because my younger siblings would not get to enjoy his teachings.  Dude bought a red jag and is enjoying his days in style though lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t a problem with being religious as much as there is a problem with people taking advantage of this religious belief. Something akin to quoting Revelations(?) about the current problems in Israel. </p>

<p>Most Christians take what their pastor/priest says at face value. I can&#39;t really call myself a Christian so much anymore; however, I have nothing against people being Christian, but I do have an issue with people who will believe anything someone they think is truthful says.... </p>

The west is filled to the rafters with well off agnosticish, atheistic, (haven&#39;t really thought about it because I don&#39;t careish) assholoes that suck up the MSM and vote red/blue like good sheep.
In contrast I know (online) quite a few poor religious types in third world countries that are WAY less &quot;under control&quot;.</p>
