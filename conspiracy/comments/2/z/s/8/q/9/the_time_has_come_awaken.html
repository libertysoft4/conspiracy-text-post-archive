Fuck the matrix. The food&#39;s fake, the entertainment&#39;s fake, the religions are fake, the news is fake, the education&#39;s fake, and the drugs don&#39;t work: it&#39;s one big scam. </p>

<p>It&#39;s time to get serious. It&#39;s time to (peacefully) build a new world based on REAL values, based on the TRUTH. We&#39;ll accomplish this by first working on ourselves, remembering the ancient wisdom: AS ABOVE, SO BELOW. </p>

<p>As we awaken, we&#39;ll manifest wise elders instead of &#39;leaders&#39; who try to enslave us. We&#39;ll create close knit communities instead of ones torn apart by bullshit. We&#39;ll stop watching friends and family needlessly suffer because the system never taught them what it means to be human. </p>

<p>Fuck fame, fuck partying, fuck watching other people do shit on TV, fuck any notion of happiness based in the future or past. Be REAL. Personally, I intend to grow into the archetypal human that I&#39;m naturally supposed to be! I will provide for  my children, fiercely defend my people, live in harmony with this beautiful planet, and help create a society based on learning, growth, and ever expanding awareness. </p>

<p>Think I&#39;m being idealistic? You still don&#39;t get it. Once you start fighting, you&#39;re whole. This reality is already here if you want it. </p>

<p>That which is above is like that which is below ; and that which below is like that which is above. </p>

<p>You know the meaning of this axiom. </p>

<p>In order for change to occur it must to occur on a a level of consciousness. After that,  the dominoes will fall in order, the puzzle will be complete. </p>

<p>As simple as it sounds, it is going to to be difficult. 
Most people don&#39;t want to wake up, because it&#39;s tough realizing nearly everything you had thought truth, are either down right lies, or based off of them. 
It SO much easier to be ignorant. Because you aren&#39;t really responsible. For anything or yourself. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing. 
When this event happens, and it will, since human beings are basically receptors for energy, everyone will become awake. 
What happens if you get shocked and you touch someone? They get shocked too. </p>

<p>Every living thing on earth ATM is linked together on a conscious level, a chemical, an atomic, and a physical one. </p>

<p>It&#39;s already happening, though. Like a snowball collecting snow as it rolls down a hill, this energy is gaining momentum.</p>

<p>This will play out in our lifetime. There is no doubt in my mind. </p>

<p>Once people learn the truth on their own terms there will be no other option but to move forward. Ever forward. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I kind of agree with this. Sometimes I think the first person to realize this was Eckhart Tolle, when he quit his job as a professor to live as nothing, just to always be in the moment. Now he is a popular pseudo-philosopher and potential spiritual leader.</p>

<p>I wish I knew why the changes in society, good and bad occur. Like why we go from being ok with a dictator to believing we need a full on revolution. Sometimes I wonder if as sensing beings we&#39;re incapable of perceiving change on a big scale if it doesn&#39;t directly relate to the five senses. In the same way that a fly cannot perceive the glass of a window it&#39;s trying to fly through, or the old myth of someone thinking they&#39;re on an island when in fact they&#39;re on an ancient turtles back. The forces that determine our futures feel like they&#39;re moving and changing. But who knows, maybe humanities awareness of how terrible things are is actually causing some kind of global resonance and forcing change for everyone, like you&#39;re saying.</p>

<p>Your comment speaks to one thing that I feel like we really need to learn as humans. We think we&#39;re super smart because we have self-awareness, but we need to become self-aware as a species and recognize we are all interconnected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cannot agree more, sir.  Nothing wrong with aggression.  Hell, nothing wrong with great <em>rage</em>.  The key is to <em>channel</em> that energy constructively toward - among other things - all of us putting down the racism, prejudices, and antagonisms that have had, from birth, brainwashed and indoctrinated into us.  We need to put them down and come together as the ONE HUMAN FAMILY which we indeed all are.  If we do this and ALL support each other independent of creed, class, race, color, etc, etc, TPTB will <em>not</em> have the power <em>that we currently GIVE them.</em></p>

<p>Exactly this, unfortunately.  We don&#39;t want to take responsibility for things, and then wonder why those very few who <em>are</em> willing to end up using it to their advantage and our <em>dis</em>advantage.  Well, it&#39;s because <em>we let them!</em>  We let them by handing over the reigns of power to them - reigns that WE OURSELVES need to be responsible enough and disciplined enough to take and guide properly ON OUR OWN.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are subconsciously looking for parent figures</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s weird.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, the thing is that it DOES take a lot of responsibility to set everything right.  With great power comes great responsibility, and setting this entire civilization right is one of the most powerful things that can get done.  As such, a lot of just.  Don&#39;t.  Wanna.  <em>Work</em>.  We don&#39;t want to take on that responsibility.</p>

<p>On one level, I can understand this.  I&#39;m a lazy bastard in my own way - just like almost all of us are.  However, I also know what teamwork can accomplish and am in <em>no</em> way afraid to roll up my sleeves and get to work with everyone toward improving this world if we all but came together.  Problem is, we first have to get our MINDS straight before we even have any hope of coming together and getting to work as <em>one</em> species toward the work we would have to do to set this civilization aright.</p>

<p>Lots of steps still needed...</p>

<p>I dunno. I think when the truth is told, it can be understood by even a child.</p>

<p>There is only one being. If that being was static, it would have no frame of reference to view any change as being relative to, and subsequently would have no experience. It is only through creating movement towards two polarities that you can allow for the infinite expansion of experience in between. That is what is represented with the Merkabah. </p>

<p>The vibrations of this expansion harmonise at scalar octaves from the macro to the micro, repeating similar patterns in a fractal form. This is the idea behind the saying &quot;as above, so below&quot;. </p>

<p>If you think of a Mandelbrot set, imagine the human experience is at the far end of one of the tendrils. We feel extremely removed from the architecture of the whole. We see super structures above us and minuscule structures below us, yet because of how far we are out on the tendril, we are under the illusion that we are separate from the whole. As we understand more, and unify the above and below, we come to realise that although we appear far from the whole, we are undeniably part of it and actually find ourselves blessed to be able to experience such degree of individuality. </p>

<p>So it is that we begin to realise that all elements of the whole are expressed at all points in the geometry. Through that we begin to realise that mind is similarly expressed in the whorls of the fractal. The higher vibrational octaves are expressed, albeit infinitesimally at all points, and by steadying our perspective enough we can access these dimensions within ourself. </p>

<p>So it is that the same expansive force, that drove us outwards towards the illusion of individuality, is the same force that affords us the opportunity to have that relativistic experience of realising just how great this show all is. </p>

<p>Now that&#39;s not really in terms that a child could understand as I feel I&#39;m somewhat constrained by attempting to articulate this through text but I hope you get the point.</p>

<p>There <em>is</em> no “far end of one of the tendrils”, for they are all the same depending upon one’s perspective.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We feel extremely removed from the architecture of the whole.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>…never realizing that we are one with it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As we understand more, and unify the above and below, we come to realise that although we appear far from the whole, we are undeniably part of it and actually find ourselves blessed to be able to experience such degree of individuality. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That has one level of significant validity.  Another level involves one area of the fractal pushing against another in exertion of a particular will.  This is where we seem to find ourselves now.  While I do not doubt that this     existence is but a tiny spark coming out of the Great Fire, and it will ultimately soon be absorbed back into it, it seems better to make the effort to help that spark shine as brightly and effectively as possible instead of stifling and manipulating it.</p>

<p>It can all be said to be ultimately for naught, however, as it doesn’t matter if one end manipulates another end of The Great Fire.  <em>Every</em> end is ultimately going right back into It and becoming one with It eventually anyway.</p>

<p>The Great Fire, it seems,  posed a question to Itself:  Is it better to remain The Great Fire <em>only</em> and that’s it? or might it not be a bad idea to splinter myself off into countless little sparks all struggling amongst each other in a wilds and often ignorant play toward eventual Oneness? sparks that can slowly develop and evolve from ignorance to an awareness and understanding of what they always were in the first place - The One Great Fire?</p>

<p>If you look at things from the perspective of The Great Fire, then, it ultimately matters not what happens to any one, individual spark created.  If you look at it from the perspective of any one, individual spark, however, then one might not mind continuing the charade of separation and continuing on growing in brightness until it eventually know itself <em>as</em> The One Great Fire.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Indeed.  The cosmos is nonlocal and holographic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The higher vibrational octaves are expressed, albeit infinitesimally at all points, and by steadying our perspective enough we can access these dimensions within ourself. </p>

<p>This is, again, correct.</p>

<p>I guess because the lower consciousnesses contain less force than those operating at a higher vibration, they shouldn&#39;t be related at a 1:1 equivalency. It&#39;s more likely that rather than a straight line (which would create the see-saw), it&#39;s an exponential relationship (log10) or something in which 10x3D:1x4D or 100x3D:10x4D:1x5D. In that sense it would only require 10% of the population to achieve critical mass for 4D to become dominant or 1 5D being to raise 100 3D up. They&#39;re just random numbers but I hope you get the gist.</p>

<p>I believe what you meant to say is that we can only make large scale (city/state/global) CHANGE in large numbers.
  We can definitely <em>act</em> in small numbers.  We can even act as individuals and, as a matter of fact, SHOULD absolutely act as individuals.</p>

<p>This is agreed.</p>

<p>And corruption has most definitely set in.  Heck, I&#39;m not sure the system didn&#39;t <em>start</em> from a foundation based on corruption actually.</p>

<p>I feel I understand the sentiment in this statement, and I think that it&#39;s definitely a valid one.  However, I also feel that if that percentage that really WANT change all got together and acted, then the sheer size of it would motivate many of those who are too scared or lazy, and those people would get up and possibly join in.  In other words, what seems needed isn&#39;t so much the majority moving forward, but simply a large enough swath of the minority doing so.</p>

<p>Yes.  &quot;Motivation&quot;, as it were.  The OWS movement that literally swept the <em>planet</em> for a spell shows at least an aspect of the very thing I&#39;m talking about.  That was a trial run.  I know we can do better as a people and citizenry, however.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Those of us who ARE awake and aware and willing to move forward intelligently need to get together and organize intelligent, non-violent but strong-willed demonstrations.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By coming together and demonstrating <em>intelligently</em>.  I was kind of talking about <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2zjjil/frankfurt_mar_18_2015_blockupy_photos/cpjlc1s">the importance of demonstrating in an <em>intelligent</em> manner</a> just the other day.</p>

<p>I like your sentiment better because it&#39;s focused on increasing the acceleration of change rather than thinking about how to initiate it. I say that because you&#39;re right, the change has already begun with the smaller groups and I really shouldn&#39;t downplay them.</p>

<p>I guess my only argument against everything is, &quot;what&#39;s the plan?&quot; and that&#39;s a hard answer to muster. With limited resources and funding to get a message out, and force people to pay attention, the solution to the problems of influence require a lot of creativity. I don&#39;t doubt that it&#39;s possible, but I do see the size of the task at hand. Our society is structured in such a way to allow the government to mystify people, and encourage them to support the systems that encourage this. The education system in the united states does a great job to remove people&#39;s ability to critically think, unless the person has a natural inclination to on his own. These are systems that have been established over the course of 60 years. They&#39;re airtight.</p>

<p>Sometimes I fear our only recourse is to continue questioning everything, and hope that either the corrupted run themselves into the ground, or people start waking up.</p>

<p>EDIT::: I think after reading a bit more of this thread I realize that it&#39;s not good to be doubtful of a cause that only aims to improve regardless of the &#39;how&#39;... so I think you&#39;ve already responded to my argument about how to proceed. Just gotta keep movin&#39;. Keep workin&#39;. </p>

<p>Although, now I wonder about my idea of &#39;needing a plan.&#39; Stay with me here, I might be thinking out loud and I&#39;m not sure if this is gonna come off clearly. Is the idea of &#39;needing a plan&#39; propaganda? Like it&#39;s an implied necessity from our respected &#39;leaders&#39; to be successful, but all it does is prevent people from thinking they can live without a structured government because our government is supposed to create those plans for us. Have people forgotton that they can act without a plan? It might be a bad idea in some instances, but not always. But if that&#39;s what the majority of people think deep down inside, then it would explain why those that feel helpless feel that way, they&#39;ve forgotten it&#39;s possible to think on their own.</p>

<p>Correct.

<blockquote>
<p>I like your sentiment better because it&#39;s focused on increasing the acceleration of change rather than thinking about how to initiate it.</p>

<p>Yes.  I wouldn’t necessarily want us to act “Only when we’re 1000% absolutely ready.” because if that’s the case, then we may never likely <em>ever</em> act and we’ll be waiting for that “perfect moment” all the way to internment/death camps.</p>

<p>We should wait until we’re ready <em>enough</em>…and I think we’re really not too far from that, if not almost upon that time already.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I guess my only argument against everything is, &quot;what&#39;s the plan?&quot; and that&#39;s a hard answer to muster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I personally think it’s an <em>extremely</em> easy answer to muster and come up with.  It’s that it’s apparently not easy to actually <em>execute</em> for many, unfortunately.  And what’s the answer?  The answer, as I’ve stated before, is for each and every one of us to put away the petty, indoctrinated racism and prejudices that have been brainwashed into us from birth, and come together as the ONE HUMAN FAMILY which we indeed all are.  We need support and cooperation between and amongst one another.  We get that, and we don’t need the enslaving paradigm of money and fiat currency that keeps us as a species beholden to those who create <del>money</del> these abstract nothings that we most definitely <em>do NOT NEED</em> in order to survive and thrive.  Indeed money is one of the main things that actually gets in the way of our thriving like we could and should.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With limited resources and funding to get a message out, and force people to pay attention, the solution to the problems of influence require a lot of creativity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And we have more creativity <em>by far</em> than all the money in the world.  The money is nothing.  The creativity and willingness to act and move forward is everything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t doubt that it&#39;s possible, but I do see the size of the task at hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s certainly a large and formidable one.  Bit by bit, I feel we could definitely and absolutely conquer it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our society is structured in such a way to allow the government to mystify people, and encourage them to support the systems that encourage this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is 100% true, unfortunately.  We have come to depend on <em>it</em> - not on each other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These are systems that have been established over the course of <del>60 years</del> many, <em>many</em> generations. They&#39;re airtight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ftfy</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I fear our only recourse is to continue questioning everything, and hope that either the corrupted run themselves into the ground, or people start waking up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think questioning is certainly <em>part</em> of it, but I also feel that each and every one of us as individuals taking at least baby steps toward doing whatever we can to BE part of the change we wish to see in the world is a pretty good step in the right direction too.  Eventually, as more and more of us all continue to simply act on our own to do good and <em>be</em> good, there will be a point upon which this general modus operandi amongst the citizens reaches a point of critical mass, and a significant enough portion of the society will at that point all be moving in the proper direction and acting together toward the goal of improvement, etc.</p>

<p>This is all good and well, but what I just described above is, admittedly, a passive approach that TPTB themselves <em>see</em> happening, and they work diligently to covertly manipulate and sway this movement <em>away</em> from evolving.  This is the reason why we as a citizenry need to take this slow, percolating, natural progression toward evolving, and become more <em>conscious</em> of it - <em>quicken</em> it, so to speak - so that we can begin to take a greater hold of that evolving energy that TPTB continue to bend back toward darkness and enslavement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think you&#39;ve already responded to my argument about how to proceed. Just gotta keep movin&#39;. Keep workin&#39;. </p>

<p>Yes sir.  Indeed.  That’s definitely part of it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><em>Exactly</em>.  <em>Very</em> well said, sir!  And <em>this</em>, ladies and gentlemen, is a pretty darn clear example of a person who is showing some serious critical thinking skills!</p>

<p>Ultimately, and as per what you just said here, it seems that it’s not a bad idea for everyone as individuals to simply do as MUCH as they can to, again, <em>be</em> the change they wish to see in the world.  You want this world to be harmonious, and balanced, and “free” and just?  Then YOU need to work hard at being harmonious and balanced and free and just.  You think there’s too much racism in the world?  Then YOU need to make sure that when you think and talk and walk the streets everyday, etc, that you treat and react to your fellow human beings as the brothers and sisters that you complain others don’t see one another as being.</p>

<p><em>BE</em> the change you wish to see in the world.  Simple as that.</p>

<p>As we all start imbuing this ideology more and more into our lives, then, like I said above, a critical mass awakening will continue (as is, perhaps, already slowly beginning to happen a bit).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have people forgotton that they can act without a [structured, organized, and collective] plan?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Many of us have.  Many of us have indeed thought that - ”Well, if we’re not ALL doing it together, then I as an individual don’t need to do shit”.</p>

<p>Wrong.  It’s almost the <em>opposite</em> of that to an extent.  Whatever plan that might exist collectively almost can’t even get off the ground en mass until each and every individual begins as thinking about what they can do to help this new paradigm move forward.</p>

<p>All very, very good thoughts you imparted here, sir.  Thank you.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Sorry, man.  Don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about w/that one.  You&#39;ll have to ELI5 on it, cuz that one whooshed over me.  (no /s).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>See? I did something, I helped 50 ppl min see a lil more clearly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh and that&#39;s a <em>wonderful</em> thing, to be sure.  No doubt and most definitely.  However, it&#39;s one thing for you and/or me and/or others to help people &quot;see a little more clearly&quot; and quite another for all of us to come together in the way we will all need to in order to put a stop to the machine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re doing something, but this beast we face isn&#39;t brought down in a day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Absolutely.  Agreed.  I certainly understand that.  However, DO NOT count your chickens before they&#39;re hatched!  It&#39;s no &quot;certainty&quot; whatsoever that &quot;we got this&quot;.  Hell, we may NOT &quot;got this&quot;.  We haven&#39;t &quot;gotten this&quot; in the entire known history of the human race.  We&#39;ve been a ruled and subjugated species <em>from day one</em>.  To just &quot;know&quot; that &quot;we got this&quot; is <em>not</em> by any means living in the reality that&#39;s taken place for us here on this planet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rome wasn&#39;t built, nor did she fall, in a day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, but when Rome DID fall, then America was built up...and look where we are now.  So when America falls, will we all celebrate only to end up having another Rome or America come up after it soon enough?</p>

<p>The issues and problems on this planet are cyclical and <em>endemic</em>.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to sound harsh or like I&#39;m fighting with <em>you</em> per se because I&#39;m not.  We are definitely on the same team, I feel.  I&#39;m just saying that - as much as we both seem to be about improvement and helping us as a species, etc - I think taking a &quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;ll all be okay&quot; attitude won&#39;t necessarily help us move toward a better civilization than the very draconian, manipulative one we have now.</p>

<p>If that&#39;s what he was saying, then it was kind of stupid because A) I&#39;m <em>very</em> calm, as I told him initially, and B) I&#39;m not thinking about getting any sort of &quot;bug out bag&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see the self-improvement as an immunization against an engineered culture that&#39;s designed to split and isolate us. If you&#39;re less racist, you won&#39;t be sucked in by race-baiters. Less sexist, they can&#39;t control you on gender issues. That sort of thing. You&#39;re removing the hooks by which the system can control you.</p>

<p>There are also things you can do to help your game. Judo or BJJ will get/keep you in shape (out of the medical system) and will teach you tactics, useful in interpreting propaganda and determining countermoves. I think they help with personal courage, too. Or chess or RTS games can help tactics without the physical demands. The key is to learn to think several moves ahead, rather than stay in a reactive mode.</p>

<p>And you can reduce your attachment to the machine, plan ahead for you and your friends/family, etc.</p>

<p>So all that is good, but it&#39;s just preparation. It hasn&#39;t translated to any action yet. I don&#39;t buy the New Age bullshit that says &quot;Just imagine a better world and it will happen. :)&quot; No, we need to get off our asses and do work. Even if it means quitting your job or whatever -- money can facilitate good work, but what good is money when you&#39;re dead? </p>

<p>We are in a fight for our survival as a sovereign species. If we fail, our children and grandchildren will be slaves.</p>

<p>I just say be looking for an opportunity to help however you can. Might be organizing groups, printing tshirts, making art... Just keep your eyes open for where you can make a difference.</p>

<p>Agreed. Improving yourself allows you to conserve vast amounts of energy because you don&#39;t get caught up in bullshit. You can then channel that surplus energy into higher order pursuits. I also like how you phrase things in terms of &#39;game.&#39; People get so identified with cultural/familial/personal baggage that life becomes all serious and weird. Fuck that, we have reason and can figure out how to play the &#39;game&#39; at ever increasing levels if we just commit ourselves to growth instead of shutting down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough, and well enough that you answered it honestly.  Why pose the question that you did then in the first place though?  If a person talks, and talks, and talks about what we <em>need</em> to do, but themselves is doing exactly ZERO about what they&#39;re suggesting, then does that somehow make the suggestions any less valid or needed or sound?  Does it make it any less the case that we SHOULD all indeed come together and do something about the draconian manipulation we are most definitely subject to?</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t.  Truth is truth regardless of who utters it or the circumstances under which they&#39;re uttered.</p>

<p>As such, the &quot;What are you doing about it?&quot; question that is so often posed on here by people is, at the end, really nothing but an antagonistic query borne from some personal need to be disruptive and/or a guilt and self-consciousness over the fact that the questioner themselves is doing absolutely nothing about the situation and, therefore, attempts to knock down the individual who is at least trying to make suggestions.  They do this instead of realizing and understanding that - yes - we SHOULD all come together and work together to do something about these absolutely shitty circumstances so many of us most definitely find ourselves in.</p>

<p>That’s a very good reason for asking that question - so good, as a matter of fact, that I feel it might have perhaps been even better posed if you would have asked the question in the manner that you formulated right here instead of the manner that you initially phrased it.  What you said right here seems quite a bit more level-headed, while the manner you initially phrased things didn’t send the kind of message and meaning you explained here.  The manner you initially phrased it used words that are pretty unanimously looked upon as confrontational, antagonistic, and simply contrarian.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You just applied an unqualified universal comment here.  This means that either you’ve come across only a very few occasions like you just described, or you haven’t been paying too much attention to the occasions when suggestions <em>have</em> been given - or at least you’ve certainly never read any of <em>my</em> posts on this subject.</p>

<p>Regardless of this, however, the fact of the matter is that I’d rather have 10 people attempting to rally without having a plan than 100 shiftless neckbeards who’ve already given up hope and aren’t doing anything <em>at all</em>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I wouldn’t go that far because, for as many of us as there are in this sub that have an idea that things are wrong (<em>way</em> wrong), even many of us in this sub don’t seem to be leading any movements toward real <em>action</em> and are, more than anything, simply your average reddit keyboard warrior.  Therefore, perhaps he’s NOT preaching to the wrong crowd.  If THIS crowd doesn’t react affirmatively to this idea (and, if you’re any indication, there are some who obviously are not), then what crowd actually would?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see the self-improvement as an immunization against an engineered culture that&#39;s designed to split and isolate us. If you&#39;re less racist, you won&#39;t be sucked in by race-baiters. Less sexist, they can&#39;t control you on gender issues. That sort of thing. You&#39;re removing the hooks by which the system can control you.</p>

<p>There are also things you can do to help your game. Judo or BJJ will get/keep you in shape (out of the medical system) and will teach you tactics, useful in interpreting propaganda and determining countermoves. I think they help with personal courage, too. Or chess or RTS games can help tactics without the physical demands. The key is to learn to think several moves ahead, rather than stay in a reactive mode.</p>

<p>And you can reduce your attachment to the machine, plan ahead for you and your friends/family, etc.</p>

<p>So all that is good, but it&#39;s just preparation. It hasn&#39;t translated to any action yet. I don&#39;t buy the New Age bullshit that says &quot;Just imagine a better world and it will happen. :)&quot; No, we need to get off our asses and do work. Even if it means quitting your job or whatever -- money can facilitate good work, but what good is money when you&#39;re dead? </p>

<p>We are in a fight for our survival as a sovereign species. If we fail, our children and grandchildren will be slaves.</p>

<p>I just say be looking for an opportunity to help however you can. Might be organizing groups, printing tshirts, making art... Just keep your eyes open for where you can make a difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I have a tendency to be unclear and vague in my communication</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, at least you acknowledged it here, sir.  That’s a sign of awareness, and awareness paves the road toward understanding, development, and growth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Slavery is a good example that our founding fathers&#39; motives may have been totally unclear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.  Many so often shower our “founding fathers” with such adulation and nostalgic praise, and my response tends to usually be “Um…excuse me, but do you remember what these ‘founding fathers’ actually <em>did?</em>  They slaughtered the millions of indigenous people already on the land, and then went to Africa and enslaved more millions there!”  wtf?  smh</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Murals in the capitol of DC are another. Maybe ideas of grandeur? All sorts of behavior relating to narcissistic and self-serving tendencies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are they similar to the craziness in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=colorado+airport+mural&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=Kt4NVf-MNoukyAT2j4DoBQ&amp;amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;amp;biw=1445&amp;amp;bih=777">the murals at the Colorado airport</a>?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I like your sentiment better because it&#39;s focused on increasing the acceleration of change rather than thinking about how to initiate it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  I wouldn’t necessarily want us to act “Only when we’re 1000% absolutely ready.” because if that’s the case, then we may never likely <em>ever</em> act and we’ll be waiting for that “perfect moment” all the way to internment/death camps.</p>

<p>We should wait until we’re ready <em>enough</em>…and I think we’re really not too far from that, if not almost upon that time already.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I guess my only argument against everything is, &quot;what&#39;s the plan?&quot; and that&#39;s a hard answer to muster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I personally think it’s an <em>extremely</em> easy answer to muster and come up with.  It’s that it’s apparently not easy to actually <em>execute</em> for many, unfortunately.  And what’s the answer?  The answer, as I’ve stated before, is for each and every one of us to put away the petty, indoctrinated racism and prejudices that have been brainwashed into us from birth, and come together as the ONE HUMAN FAMILY which we indeed all are.  We need support and cooperation between and amongst one another.  We get that, and we don’t need the enslaving paradigm of money and fiat currency that keeps us as a species beholden to those who create <del>money</del> these abstract nothings that we most definitely <em>do NOT NEED</em> in order to survive and thrive.  Indeed money is one of the main things that actually gets in the way of our thriving like we could and should.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With limited resources and funding to get a message out, and force people to pay attention, the solution to the problems of influence require a lot of creativity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And we have more creativity <em>by far</em> than all the money in the world.  The money is nothing.  The creativity and willingness to act and move forward is everything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t doubt that it&#39;s possible, but I do see the size of the task at hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s certainly a large and formidable one.  Bit by bit, I feel we could definitely and absolutely conquer it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our society is structured in such a way to allow the government to mystify people, and encourage them to support the systems that encourage this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is 100% true, unfortunately.  We have come to depend on <em>it</em> - not on each other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These are systems that have been established over the course of <del>60 years</del> many, <em>many</em> generations. They&#39;re airtight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ftfy</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I fear our only recourse is to continue questioning everything, and hope that either the corrupted run themselves into the ground, or people start waking up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think questioning is certainly <em>part</em> of it, but I also feel that each and every one of us as individuals taking at least baby steps toward doing whatever we can to BE part of the change we wish to see in the world is a pretty good step in the right direction too.  Eventually, as more and more of us all continue to simply act on our own to do good and <em>be</em> good, there will be a point upon which this general modus operandi amongst the citizens reaches a point of critical mass, and a significant enough portion of the society will at that point all be moving in the proper direction and acting together toward the goal of improvement, etc.</p>

<p>This is all good and well, but what I just described above is, admittedly, a passive approach that TPTB themselves <em>see</em> happening, and they work diligently to covertly manipulate and sway this movement <em>away</em> from evolving.  This is the reason why we as a citizenry need to take this slow, percolating, natural progression toward evolving, and become more <em>conscious</em> of it - <em>quicken</em> it, so to speak - so that we can begin to take a greater hold of that evolving energy that TPTB continue to bend back toward darkness and enslavement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think you&#39;ve already responded to my argument about how to proceed. Just gotta keep movin&#39;. Keep workin&#39;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes sir.  Indeed.  That’s definitely part of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is the idea of &#39;needing a plan&#39; propaganda? Like it&#39;s an implied necessity from our respected &#39;leaders&#39; to be successful, but all it does is prevent people from thinking they can live without a structured government because our government is supposed to create those plans for us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Exactly</em>.  <em>Very</em> well said, sir!  And <em>this</em>, ladies and gentlemen, is a pretty darn clear example of a person who is showing some serious critical thinking skills!</p>

<p>Ultimately, and as per what you just said here, it seems that it’s not a bad idea for everyone as individuals to simply do as MUCH as they can to, again, <em>be</em> the change they wish to see in the world.  You want this world to be harmonious, and balanced, and “free” and just?  Then YOU need to work hard at being harmonious and balanced and free and just.  You think there’s too much racism in the world?  Then YOU need to make sure that when you think and talk and walk the streets everyday, etc, that you treat and react to your fellow human beings as the brothers and sisters that you complain others don’t see one another as being.</p>

<p><em>BE</em> the change you wish to see in the world.  Simple as that.</p>

<p>As we all start imbuing this ideology more and more into our lives, then, like I said above, a critical mass awakening will continue (as is, perhaps, already slowly beginning to happen a bit).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have people forgotton that they can act without a [structured, organized, and collective] plan?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Many of us have.  Many of us have indeed thought that - ”Well, if we’re not ALL doing it together, then I as an individual don’t need to do shit”.</p>

<p>Wrong.  It’s almost the <em>opposite</em> of that to an extent.  Whatever plan that might exist collectively almost can’t even get off the ground en mass until each and every individual begins as thinking about what they can do to help this new paradigm move forward.</p>

<p>All very, very good thoughts you imparted here, sir.  Thank you.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
