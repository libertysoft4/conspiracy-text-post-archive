        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First I know this isn&#39;t necessarily a conspiracy, so hate all you want; but I could not find a decent sub to discuss this in. I have always been interested in secret societies.  Mostly because I never saw my grandparents without their rings and pins associating them with their little &quot;clubs&quot;.   </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know my grandfather well because he died before I was born.  I grew up in an incredibly small community where everyone knows everyone.  Most of what I know about my grandfather only comes from stories about him.  From what I gather the community saw him as a hard working, nice man, who was extremely secretive.  He was more then happy to enjoy a beer with you at the end of a hard day but it was gonna be at your house.  He apparently did not have guests over ever.   The only other things I know about him is he was a member of the Free Masons.  Every photo I see of him he has a ring and usually a pin linking to the free masons.   </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t what interests me though, being as I did not know the man myself and do not have a lot of information, there is not much I really know about the man.   MY grandmother on the other hand is a whole other story.  My grandmother is arguably more into the secret society stuff because I know more about what she is involved in because I have spent a lot of time with her.</p>

<p>My grandmother is a Rosicrucian.  She is always ALWAYS wearing a ring and a necklace associating with the Rosicrucian and another &quot;Society&quot;; when she wears formal attire she wears a Rosicrucian pin.  When I would ask here about here meetings she would be nonchalant and basically allude to harmless church stuff.  Which I honestly believe.  She is also apart of another group though.  This one I am not totally familiar with because we only talked about it once.  The name of the group was in another language and the only word I recognized was light.  These meetings she never told me about and never told me anything about this group other then it was associated with the Rosicrucians.  The only thing I knew about this group is my grandmother took trips to Israel several times with them.  One time their trip was canceled because of the fighting in the middle east according to her.</p>

<p>I assume this is just a bunch of harmless old religious ladies being harmless old religious ladies.  Is it common for masons to marry Rosicrucian since women cannot be free masons, and they are apparently similar? The trips to Isreal is that just a &quot;visiting the holy lands&quot; thing?  I was curios if anyone knows more about the Rosicrucian and what the actual name of this other order connected to the Rosicrucian is called?  I just find the roots of these societies interesting, and wanted to learn more. </p>

<p>Was it the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Brotherhood_of_Light">Hermetic Brotherhood of Light</a> she had mentioned to you?</p>

<p>To clarify:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Measure a corner of the Creation, and multiply that
space in proportional progression, and the entire
Infinite will multiply its circles filled with
universes, which will pass in proportional segments
between the ideal and elongating branches of your
Compass. Now suppose that from any point whatever of
the Infinite above you a hand holds another Compass or
a Square, the lines of the Celestial triangle will
necessarily meet those of the Compass of Science, to
form the Mysterious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_of_Solomon">Star of Solomon</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I have not seen a lot of pictures of my grandfather but every one has masonic symbols in it.  Almost every one of my grandmothers crucifixes are the same shape as the rosy cross, literally the rosy cross, or a crucifix with a rose in the center (I assume is a rosy cross lol). As for the other society, that doesn&#39;t sound familiar.  I am pretty sure it was in Latin and one of the words was light.  I remember when I was younger she told me what it was but I cannot remember.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Besides the rings, jewelry, and pins? She has never hid her association with them from me and when I was little I would accompany her to the meetings where I would wait in a playroom with other kids. As I got older I was allowed to do my own thing.  When her meetings were done they would bring food and coffee into the meeting rooms and we were then allowed to go in and sit with them while they made small talk with each other.  The meetings were mostly held at the church, but many times they were held in other close cities and other churches and I did not accompany her to these meetings.</p>

<p>I honestly never thought of it anything other then harmless ladies doing harmless church stuff.  I am more interested in the roots of these societies then their current practices.   I believe most of these societies have been incredibly watered down and only a core group of practitioners actually follow the original ideals.  I believe my grandparents were just part of the watered down versions.  But I am still interested in what makes these societies tick and what it was that attracted my grandparents to joining.   Since my understanding their(these types of secret societies) religious beliefs while being christian are often quite different and have other things like kabalism mixed into them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you&#39;re referring to would be an inner order of adepts, what some would refer to as the New and Reformed Palladian Rite, which may or may not in fact exist, one the overwhelming majority of Masons would have no part of.</p>

<p>The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the Initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them; but it is intended that he shall imagine he understands them. Their true explication is reserved for the Adepts, the Princes of Masonry.</p>

<p>In the 20th century, an occultist named Max Heindel said he had a vision of Christian Rosenkreutz -- the legendary and arguably mythological founder of the order -- who directed him to establish a number of Rosicrucian churches in the United States. </p>

<p>Your grandmother may have been a member of one of his churches. It was quite a large organization. </p>

<p>Coincidentally, one of the best sources to learn about Rosicrucianism from would be Manly P. Hall&#39;s book <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/sta/">the Secret Teachings of All Ages.</a> It is not light reading, and if you are new to the subject, I recommend reading the introduction and conclusion first to orient you. </p>

<p>The author&#39;s mother was a member of Heindel&#39;s church. Hall spent some time in his youth with them, but was primarily raised by his grandmother. He wrote his book -- which is truly a gigantic tome -- at the age of 27. It is widely considered to be one of the greatest books ever written on the esoteric and occult, both for its detail and its scope. People have wondered how he came to so much wisdom at such a young age, especially since he was not formally educated. </p>

<p>One could speculate that Heindel was telling the truth, and indeed had a vision of the leader-mystic of the Rosy Cross, and instructed the young Hall in the mysteries of the universe. </p>

<p>Keep in mind that the Rosicrucians are not commonly identified as nefarious groups, like the Illuminati or Skull &amp; Bones. </p>

<p><a href="/u/quantumcipher">/u/quantumcipher</a> has seeded a large and fascinating list of articles related to this subject on <a href="/r/occultconspiracy">/r/occultconspiracy</a>. I recently created that subreddit, and would love if you subscribed and cross posted your story for discussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very well written, and eerily relevant. A couple excerpts from the conclusion: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the ranks of the so-called learned there is rising up a new order of thinkers, which may best be termed the School of the Worldly Wise Men. After arriving at the astounding conclusion that they are the intellectual salt of the earth, these gentlemen of letters have appointed themselves the final judges of all knowledge, both human and divine. This group affirms that all mystics must have been epileptic and most of the saints neurotic! It declares God to be a fabrication of primitive superstition; the universe to be intended for no particular purpose; immortality to be a figment of the imagination; and an outstanding individuality to be but a fortuitous combination of cells! Pythagoras is asserted to have suffered from a &quot;bean complex&quot;; Socrates was a notorious inebriate; St. Paul was subject to fits; Paracelsus was an infamous quack, the Comte di Cagliostro a mountebank, and the Comte de St.-Germain the outstanding crook of history!</p>

<p>What do the lofty concepts of the world&#39;s illumined saviors and sages have in common with these stunted, distorted products of the &quot;realism&quot; of this century? All over the world men and women ground down by the soulless cultural systems of today are crying out for the return of the banished age of beauty and enlightenment--for something practical in the highest sense of the word. A few are beginning to realize that so-called civilization in its present form is at the vanishing point; that coldness, heartlessness, commercialism, and material efficiency are impractical, and only that which offers opportunity for the expression of love and ideality is truly worth while. All the world is seeking happiness, but knows not in what direction to search. Men must learn that happiness crowns the soul&#39;s quest for understanding. Only through the realization of infinite goodness and infinite accomplishment can the peace of the inner Self be assured. In spite of man&#39;s geocentricism, there is something in the human mind that is reaching out to philosophy--not to this or that philosophic code, but simply to philosophy in the broadest and fullest sense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The one hope of the world is philosophy, for all the sorrows of modern life result from the lack of a proper philosophic code. Those who sense even in part the dignity of life cannot but realize the shallowness apparent in the activities of this age. Well has it been said that no individual can succeed until he has developed his philosophy of life. Neither can a race or nation attain true greatness until it has formulated an adequate philosophy and has dedicated its existence to a policy consistent with that philosophy. During the World War, when so-called civilization hurled one half of itself against the other in a frenzy of hate, men ruthlessly destroyed something more precious even than human life: they obliterated those records of human thought by which life can be intelligently directionalized. Truly did Mohammed declare the ink of philosophers to be more precious than the blood of martyrs. Priceless documents, invaluable records of achievement, knowledge founded on ages of patient observation and experimentation by the elect of the earth--all were destroyed with scarcely a qualm of regret. What was knowledge, what was truth, beauty, love, idealism, philosophy, or religion when compared to man&#39;s desire to control an infinitesimal spot in the fields of Cosmos for an inestimably minute fragment of time? Merely to satisfy some whim or urge of ambition man would uproot the universe, though well he knows that in a few short years he must depart, leaving all that he has seized to posterity as an old cause for fresh contention.</p>

<p>War--the irrefutable evidence of irrationality--still smolders in the hearts of men; it cannot die until human selfishness is overcome. Armed with multifarious inventions and destructive agencies, civilization will continue its fratricidal strife through future ages, But upon the mind of man there is dawning a great fear--the fear that eventually civilization will destroy itself in one great cataclysmic struggle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At one point referring to an order of priests and kings in ancient Judea, alleged practitioners of the Merkabah, and to some students of the Mystery Schools of Ancient Egypt, later alleged to have ties to the Essenes and Gnosticism. In ancient Judea, it was a term synonymous with being both a king and priest simultaneously, as was the case with the supposed messiah, Yeshuah and with the order&#39;s namesake, Melchizedek. The implications of this order being more relevant to theologians, more or less irrelevant in esotericism and as pertains to secret societies. To others, it may still exist today in the same manner as some view the Great White Brotherhood, in a purely allegorical sense as a group of alleged ascended masters. Though unlike the order of Melchizedek, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Chiefs">Secret Chiefs</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_White_Brotherhood#History">Great White Brotherhood</a> are known to have been in contact with certain adepts and founding members of key initiatory orders and secret societies over the centuries, perhaps millennia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you&#39;re referring to would be an inner order of adepts, what some would refer to as the New and Reformed Palladian Rite, which may or may not in fact exist, one the overwhelming majority of Masons would have no part of.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the Initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them; but it is intended that he shall imagine he understands them. Their true explication is reserved for the Adepts, the Princes of Masonry.</p>

<p>It is well enough for the mass of those called Masons, to imagine that all is contained in the Blue Degrees; and whoso attempts to undeceive them will labor in vain.</p>

<p>And you are mistaken to presume any ritual is inherently negative. It depends on the ritual, who is performing it and in what context. If you are Christian, your Sunday mass is in fact a ritual.</p>
