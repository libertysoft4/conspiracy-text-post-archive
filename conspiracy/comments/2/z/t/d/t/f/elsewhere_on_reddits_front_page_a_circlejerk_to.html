<p>On the contrary, <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> allows us to know how much what we say is bothering those people, and how absolutely obsessed they are with supporting the official narrative.</p>

<p>They are outing themselves for the propagandists they are, why not allow them?</p>

<p>Why? Let the record stand of the activities of that hate group and the daily mockery they spew online.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t use vote brigading, everything is posted with .np links, people can&#39;t delete that and use it as normal from other accounts.................................</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, so I can see when you say that the jet fuel &quot;weakened&quot; the beams, but.... only in the floors which were hit. If the plane hit on the 96th floor and there was damage from 93rd to 99th. That leaves how many stories below unaffected? In order for that building to come down as it did on that day, the columns on each level would have to buckle for some reason (which is unexplainable with the official story). Just because the top level beams where weakened, doesn&#39;t mean the other levels where also. </p>

<p>So, if we go by physics. There is more matter below the hit area. Therefore, the pancake &quot;theory&quot; is impossible, because it defies physics. A few floors <em>could</em> pancake down, but every time a floor is pancaked it looses velocity. Because you have a greater force pushing up (ie. the other 90+ floors) against the floors coming down. If we go by physics, than a few floors would&#39;ve been crushed but then stopped. Leaving a &quot;capstone&quot; if you will, on top of the rest of the 90+ floors.</p>

<p>Those building fell at free fall and literally turned to dust. This cannot be explained with the pancake theory. That would not pulverize metal, concrete, office equipment, people, etc etc.</p>

<p>As the collapsing mass fall it <em>accelerates</em> and gains mass.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/pseudosc/911nutphysics.htm">This is a pretty good simple summary</a> of the physics involved in the collapse (look at the &#39;Free Fall&#39; section). </p>

<p>The claim that the collapse is impossible even by simple high-school physics is absurd because the collapse is easily studied by <em>anyone</em> and not a single physicist anywhere in the world, even Iran, China or Russia, has ever published any study that aims to prove this collapse is impossible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re simple high school physics does prove it can&#39;t happen. Gravity also pushes up, ie the bottom 90+ stories. A pancake could happen to a few floors, not the entire building. Physics doesn&#39;t work that way. You might want to re read your HS books. There was an episode on King of the nerds that explains this. The winner won based on 9/11 truth physics and principles. <a href="http://www1.ae911truth.org/en/news-section/57-news-releases-by-others/931-pink-haired-nerd-scores-win-thanks-to-911-truth-websites.html">Here is an article talking about it.</a>. I tried finding the video of it that I saw on youtube, but it appears to all be taken down due to copyright bullshit. There was also a video on vimeo, but that too was taken down. So if you can, maybe netflix has it, so you can watch the video of her explaining and the actual contest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Btw i just read (most of)that. Its nothing i havent heard. It doesnt change my mind. It doesnt explain the underground pools or the eyewitness claims from the basement. Molten metal aside. Theres no way the buildings could have collapsed like that without all the support columns being cut simultaneously. Theres so much more. Insider trading, suspicious call outs from work, the cell phone calls, the suspiciously small hole in the pentagon, the fbi whistleblowers who tried to give warnings and were ignored, the multiple foreign warnings, the lack of air defense at day, the convenient drills for the same situations, the saudi sale of airline stock, the hijackers found alive, the money made off of the wars, the lack of wreckage in PA, the announcement of bldg 7s collapse before it happened, the patriot act being prewritten, the story already set to go to the middle east....on and on... There is too much to ignore and the physics of it all makes no sense. Ive been there, i used to believe the official stories and for a while tried very hardr to convince myself i was wrong. Nonetheless im convinced we had foreknowledge and probably participated in the events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, you asked what could be the cause of enough heat to melt steel. Now you&#39;re moving the goalposts.</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;ve seen that before but anyway:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Power puts thermite in a fired clay pot which <em>prevents</em> the heat from doing as much damage as it would if he had placed the thermite directly on top of the xbox. Ludicrous.</p></li>
<li><p>Power complains that the Jones/Harrit paper goes into detail about the provenance of their dust samples? Strawman.</p></li>
<li><p>The cartoon characters are ad hominem attacks on Jones/Harrit et al. </p></li>
<li><p>Ad hominem attack on the Bentham journal. Power also uses two examples of hoax papers that were &quot;accepted&quot; by the journal. The fact is that the emails &quot;accepting&quot; the papers were attempts to find out who the hoaxers actually were. This was explained by the journal editors but is still completely ignored by debunksters. <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17288-crap-paper-accepted-by-journal.html#.U7JRFbEQGUM">&quot;In this particular case we were aware that the article submitted was a hoax, and we tried to find out the identity of the individual by pretending the article had been accepted for publication when in fact it was not.&quot;</a></p></li>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.debunking911.com/moltensteel.htm">Honestly, read through this entire page. The explaination is far too long to post here.</a> If you have issue with it, outline what it is here. I would <strong>love</strong> to read it. But if you leave questioning whether the rhetoric you&#39;ve been told about molten steel is wrong, <em>question the rest of it.</em></p>

<p>Just be skeptical and don&#39;t put your fingers in your ears.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>both the BBC and CNN or MSNBC interviewed six or seven of the named &#39;hijackers&#39;</p>

<p>they were people who had had their passports stolen and their IDs borrowed/stolen.</p>

<p>its absolute fact that one third of the named people are or were alive in 2002.</p>

<p>now the question of wherever there were 19 real hijackers with real or borrowed names/IDs, that is another story.</p>
