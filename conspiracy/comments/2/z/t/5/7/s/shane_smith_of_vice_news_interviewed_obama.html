    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah. It&#39;s a great way for writers to get some attention and jumpstart their career, no question. Also they don&#39;t have an agenda persay but I think OP&#39;s point was for all their bluster about being anti establishment they just gave the president a rimjob instead of talking about anything of value or depth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly you can&#39;t have an edgy interview with POTUS and elect it to go anywhere or be vetted before the interview. The fact both the POTUS and VP gave them an interview shows they&#39;re at least stepping up their game from the trashy punk shit they used to publish. It&#39;ll give them more of a voice if they act like the rest of the major news media. </p>

Vice even came and interviewed my friends and I last year for some documentary they were doing. I get a strange vibe from their employees. Nowadays they want to just become a top multimedia company.. Fuck being edgy and adversarial.  I gave up on vice.. Now I just read a select writer here and there from select papers and websites. Ahh who knows. Money and success corrupts</p>

<p>What isn&#39;t? Video games, books, TV, night clubs, any media, social clubs, sports. Everything is a distraction. So what are we supposed to be looking at? We&#39;re all humans just trying to enjoy the time we have here.</p>

<p>VICE is shit media, and honestly a lot of their stories are very bias, sarcastic and condescending, especially their work in SE Asia. VICE News is a lot better than their main channel and sometimes produces quality work. The two channels should be viewed separately, even if they have the same management. One is bullshit entertainment, the other is journalism (even if you think it&#39;s poor quality).</p>

<hr/>

<p>As for ISIS, there&#39;s no clear sources saying they directly funded them. Unless you can provide some? and don&#39;t link me the pic of John McCain meeting with ISIS leaders before they became ISIS. A real source.</p>

<p>ISIS of course took a lot of money and weaponry from Iraq and other countries storage when they stormed over the middle east, but USA didn&#39;t want that to happen. War lines the pockets of American elite, but I think sometimes you give them too much credit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious to them that bombing indiscriminately is going to cause people to help out &quot;terrorist&quot; groups. If you have no job, no education, no future, and USA just blew up your brother, fuck yeah you&#39;re going to fight back. USA knew this and created a problem. USA also want to maintain control in that area and ISIS has made that very hard, they don&#39;t want to fund ISIS.</p>

<p>So you agree they are not meant to be anything other than another distraction for the masses? Yes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What isn&#39;t? Video games, books, TV, night clubs, any media, social clubs, sports. Everything is a distraction. So what are we supposed to be looking at? We&#39;re all humans just trying to enjoy the time we have here.</p>

<p>VICE is shit media, and honestly a lot of their stories are very bias, sarcastic and condescending, especially their work in SE Asia. VICE News is a lot better than their main channel and sometimes produces quality work. The two channels should be viewed separately, even if they have the same management. One is bullshit entertainment, the other is journalism (even if you think it&#39;s poor quality).</p>

<hr/>

<p>As for ISIS, there&#39;s no clear sources saying they directly funded them. Unless you can provide some? and don&#39;t link me the pic of John McCain meeting with ISIS leaders before they became ISIS. A real source.</p>

<p>ISIS of course took a lot of money and weaponry from Iraq and other countries storage when they stormed over the middle east, but USA didn&#39;t want that to happen. War lines the pockets of American elite, but I think sometimes you give them too much credit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious to them that bombing indiscriminately is going to cause people to help out &quot;terrorist&quot; groups. If you have no job, no education, no future, and USA just blew up your brother, fuck yeah you&#39;re going to fight back. USA knew this and created a problem. USA also want to maintain control in that area and ISIS has made that very hard, they don&#39;t want to fund ISIS.</p>
