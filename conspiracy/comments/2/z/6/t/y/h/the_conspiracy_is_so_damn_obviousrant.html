        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The so called &#39;conspiracy&#39; is really fucking obvious. People refuse to see it because they lack self esteem. We all start out as wonderfully happy, imaginative, and spirited creatures who are totally &#39;in-sync&#39; with life. Usually during adolescence, we start to become accustomed to some degree of suffering and thus enter the matrix. </p>

<p>However, you don&#39;t need to dig up arcane government documents or read David Icke to realize that something is off. If you&#39;re smart, even the white washed and heavily censored version of history taught at government schools should set off alarm bells. We study the exploits of fucking Kings and Queens. These are the people who ran states (i.e. tax farms) for their own personal gain and wouldn&#39;t hesitate to kill thousands or millions of people in order to enrich themselves. But yeah, that&#39;s &#39;normal.&#39; Personally, if I was ever forced to subjugate myself to a so called King (really, an enslaver/darkworker) I&#39;d die fighting for my freedom. I intend to live a long and prosperous life while raising empowered and beautiful children!</p>

<p>The State and all these hierarchical systems are enslavement. Any rational person can see that. People shut down (i.e. choose to lower their awareness) in order to avoid the painful reality of this world. But guess what: you don&#39;t get to be the archetypal hero/star/mother/father/warrior/healer or whatever the fuck else you want to be until you take total responsibility for your own life and start to be courageous. Choosing to be ignorant and lower your perception will result in anxiety/depression/addiction/relationship/health issues. Most people, though, don&#39;t make the connection between these problems and their own actions, instead believing them to be largely random. Give me a break. We have the gift of thought and reason, but you really can&#39;t figure out why you drink too much? Nonsense. </p>

<p>Furthermore, we resonate with archetypes. The &quot;Hero&#39;s Journey&quot; is the blueprint for the vast majority of Hollywood scripts. Little kids intuitively understand the battle between Good and Evil in the Lion King and other movies because this shit is encoded in our DNA. 
Deep down, we know what life is about and get depressed because we&#39;re failing to live up to our potential. That&#39;s right: your problems aren&#39;t fucking real. What they are actually telling you is that you&#39;ve fallen out of rhythm with life and need to get back into it! 
Again, there is no debate about the conspiracy. Royalty (i.e. your owners) has and does exist. Pedophiles in government exist. Operation Gladio happened. The Queen fucking hung out with Jimmy Saville constantly...I mean how obvious can this get?! </p>

<p>I encourage everyone from the bottom of my heart to start being honest with themselves. Remember childhood, remember what it felt like. Why don&#39;t you feel like that any more? Before you start throwing out all the standard excuses, remember: we have the power of reason and thought. We can figure this shit out! Logic can help us become happier, healthier, and more powerful. Once you accept this mindset, suffering about anything becomes irrational/weird. Let&#39;s fucking do this and overthrow the evil motherfuckers that we have collectively manifested and create a new earth. </p>

<p>Edit: Thanks for gold!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You want to know why being an adult is different than being a child?  </p>

<p>As a child, someone is taking care of you (hopefully).  That&#39;s why you have your &quot;freedom&quot;.  That&#39;s why you&#39;re carefree.  Do you think your parents were carefree?  Nope.  Because they had you.  Because they had something to care for.</p>

<p>The ignorance of being a child is what makes being a child so fun.  Growing up, you lose the people who take care of you because you have to start taking care of yourself.  It&#39;s not because of the State.  It&#39;s not because some oligarchy or totalitarian government is subduing you.  It&#39;s because you actually have stuff to think about now other than what toy you are going to play with next.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for critical thinking (yes yes I know many here think I&#39;m a shill or whatever), and I&#39;m all for seeking true happiness.  I&#39;m happy.  I&#39;m healthy.  I&#39;m powerful in my own right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>there&#39;s a beautiful bit in the bible that talks about this,</p>

<p>Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there betongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.</p>

<p>I totally agree that we&#39;ve moved on from the innocence of childhood, however i think the system really has pulled the wool over our eyes as well - there are certain things that we understood as a child, abit only dimly, as we&#39;ve grown the system brainwashes us into thinking we were wrong about those things and not to trust ourselves but with wisdom, study and the refinement of age most come to realise that in fact we were right at first and what the system made us think was in err. </p>

<p>faith, hope and charity the greatest of which is charity - our society teaches us to have no faith in ourselves or our fellow, to have no hope and give or take no charity; we think hope to be dumb, charity to be insulting, and faith has somehow got over written with blind obedience to an authoritarian and self-aggrandizing empire. </p>

<p>The flower blooms in all it&#39;s glory unfurled to the sun, the glory of the shoot, the glory of the seed. From damp soil and darkness knowing only the way to reach starts the process of growth which leads a plant to beauty and a person to understanding. </p>

<p>You just explained people who are born into wealth very succinctly.  I personally don&#39;t find any pressing need to have an &quot;ownership class&quot;, but I believe dying in battle with their hired goons would be futile at best.  To fight a battle in the manner your enemy has chosen is to concede any advantage you might otherwise obtain.</p>

<p>Unless you enjoy being one of their toys, or are among their ranks, they are your enemies without doubt.  But an open revolution is not ready to succeed.</p>

As adults of course we&#39;ve moved on from wanting to spend our days playing with toys. But that doesn&#39;t mean that we can&#39;t find the same joy and sense of purpose that little kids have. We just have bigger fish to fry now need to step up to the challenge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks man I&#39;ve posted him and this many times it is imperative to understanding real law and not this synthetic punishment system of caging humans due to consciousness expansion  (drugs) or failure to pay fees and fines. Hardly any of the people in prison deserve to be there as it will not ever change the self hate that put them in there in the first place. The ignorant people in prison will only turn the hatred outwards against a system that gamed them and most likely their previous generations too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I can relate to this message a lot. I remember that my childhood was probably the most free period of my life so far, free to enjoy the essentials of life and all the simple pleasures. And then somewhere along the way I got hit by lots of suggestions that put me off course. But thanks to the internet, I have gained a lot of insight and awareness.</p>

<p>I agree that suffering is largely unnecessary these days, and that progress in humanity should be measured by how much we can reduce suffering and help others. Until we are all fully self-educated and self-disciplined, it may take a while. But I have hope that the future generations will prevail as the truths come out easier and faster than ever.</p>

<p>The consumer zombie doesn&#39;t care about any of that mess. All they want is to be able to buy that cool new thing. It doesn&#39;t matter that it is the same thing as a couple years ago, just a little more fancy. They want it, and are willing to stand in line to pre-pay for it. That is all the zombie cares about, not politics, not pollution, not war, or debt. They don&#39;t care if their rights are being violated without their knowledge, or if they even have rights at all. It just wants to have Internet access and money to buy that new thing. If something were to stand in the way of that, suddenly they will care.</p>

<p>The State and all these hierarchical systems are enslavement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty broad statement that I can&#39;t entirely agree with.  Intrusive big government is certainly bad but no state at all is anarchy, and hierarchical systems are good if they&#39;re the right ones based on correct principles. </p>

<p>For example, many folks push for a hierarchy-free, egalitarian society, but unfortunately those just end up being communist regimes.  The ultimate hierarchy itself with a small group of elites and everyone else equally poor and enslaved to the state.  A better hierarchy system is a more familiar one: God/church, decentralized government, male leadership, white collar, blue collar etc. We&#39;re slowly getting further and further away from this sort of system. That&#39;s why I say it&#39;s obvious that the &quot;conspiracy&quot; for one world government is actually communist in it&#39;s goal (and &quot;new-age&quot; / everyone is &quot;equal&quot; is it&#39;s religion).</p>

<p>Let&#39;s fucking do this and overthrow the evil motherfuckers that we have collectively manifested and create a new earth.</p>

<p>It&#39;s too late imo. And if you&#39;re not wise to their plan they will just use you for their communist agenda because they&#39;ll say the exact same thing: &quot;let&#39;s create a new earth, where everyone is equal, and no one is poor&quot;:</p>

<p>You&#39;re best bet is to make plans to escape with your family to the bush when it gets really bad.  Learn how to build a cabin, stock supplies, get firearms and ammo, and make a plan.  Collective ideas aren&#39;t going to work.  It now comes down to the individual.  Look out for number one. </p>

<p>I&#39;m against communism and other collectivist forms of social organization. I agree that there is a natural hierarchy in terms of intelligence, achievement, etc. However, I vehemently disagree with the notion of a predator class that uses superior knowledge/awareness to trick the masses into subordination. I personally want my leaders to encourage growth in all aspects of life!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only problem I would foresee is that while overthrowing our government and the way things work currently would result in changing our reality and that of a few generations to come, there would come a time when people would once again become complacent and comfortable with the reality that they live in, and unwilling to fight even the smallest steps to erode away at that reality.  A prime example would be the evolution of the now-Americans society freeing European countries and forming Democracy here in the US, and the constant attempts by the banking cartels to bend that to their will and overthrow it themselves to regain power.  The attempted murder of Andrew Jackson was the beginning, but they failed.  The Jekyll Island meeting and subsequent passing of the Federal Reserve Act by the US government was the culmination of that, and the beginning of the end of us being able to control our own destinies.  </p>

<p>Ultimately <em>we</em> feel the repression on society as a result of that control by the elites, and would be willing to fight to change it, but if we were to succeed in once again eradicating these people from their control on our lives, they would not simply fade into the shadows.  And 100 years down the line it might be very difficult to convince those generations how important it is to not let these people compromise even the smallest aspects of their lives.  Humanity and society seems to go in cycles in this manner.  I&#39;m not using this as an excuse to not try, I&#39;d just be most concerned with how we would prevent ourselves from falling into the same trap once again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Remember childhood.&quot; Well said. Completely agree with what you are saying here except for the last sentence. In my opinion, we don&#39;t need to overthrow anyone because this is a voluntary system that people subject themselves to. </p>

<p>I think the idea that we need to topple the existing power structure by force (which may not be what you are implying but is a common thought) is limiting because the powers that be are very good at using violence. At this point meaningful violent resistance is nearly futile because of the power disparity. Even if it were possible, it seems like violent revolution always revolves right back into the same system (France and USA for example) because the change is superficial.</p>

<p>However if we choose not to send our children to school, into the military, refuse to subject them to the programming and teach them to think, the system will eventually wither. They will grow up outside of it and while it may continue to be a threat, it will no longer rule over them. Over generations it will wither. Those who created it planned over centuries and I think that is the best way to escape it. </p>

<p>Totally agree. I should&#39;ve been more clear - I&#39;m talking about a mental/spiritual revolution, not a violent one. We are the ones who collectively manifested this system (as I said, the masses don&#39;t want to take full responsibility and thus want to live in a controlled environment.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, we are built with leader follower instincts.</p>

<p>Its only natural for people to step up and dominate others, the issue is that it gets out of hand and the people are able to step up go mad trying to preserve the power through generations (e.g royalty).</p>

<p>Idk, this is why I just tell people that people shouldn&#39;t rule over other people. I personally hope that we will just be smart enough to let AI run humanity. Since given the right programming AI rulers can just be an active 10 commandments that enforce themselves. We all know whats right and wrong on base levels. Its only when we have peoples perceptions come into play do we start seeing the perversion of simple truths/laws.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree about the leader/follower dynamic. People have historically wanted to give away their power (i.e. to exist at lower levels of awareness where personal problems/stress are less conscious). The problem, though, is that this power has to go somewhere - and it ends up empowering governments/elites/the military, etc. to rape people en masse. We truly are all connected. Personally, I want to see individuals become conscious and force our leaders to reflect more positive values! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well to be simple its like that meme from the incredibles.</p>

<p>If everyone was an alpha dog no one would be. Public leaders are bought and controlled with money and policy, the irony is we layered all these rules to prevent free range of power but all it did was allow bullshit to take over. The issue is, there is just too damn much. People, too damn many things to regulate/maintain.</p>

<p>I personally think we should go back to tribe or city state mentality. But even then there would probably a lot of in-fighting because, people. There would probably have been nothing but civil wars if U.S.A was instead 40 or so sovereign states after than civil war. Instead of all this shitty foreign policy and pointless foreign war, we would just be fighting each other until one or 2 states formed a new north and south so to speak with the victor forming a united states. Its just fucked I think, no system to date seems to work where everyone benefits for the most part. Capitalism worked well until the infants born from the industrial boom made their dynasties and now they sit high and leech long. The stagnant state the world is in is almost suffocating IMHO. And is why I think generation x has so much angst and uncertainty in their life paths or career choices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t necessarily believe that there is a conscious &#39;conspiracy&#39; though. It&#39;s more that our current system of governance was built up over generations and has become twisted in the same way that all bureaucracies will. It tends towards a callous complexity - justifying jobs and roles while simultaneously causing redunancies and ruining lives in the process. </p>

<p>Read this essay, I found it very enlightening and left me stopping looking for someone to blame and thinking more about the systems that govern our lives.

    <div class="md"><p>I won&#39;t disagree that kings, queens and other figures of political power have dominated history. But the whole notion that there&#39;s nothing that can be done because we&#39;re all indoctrinated in school by history is stupid. </p>

<p>The enlightenment and the great American political experiment of democracy are foundational elements of American history coursework and the spread of democracy at the expense of politically oppressive monarchs, theocrats, and dictators is a central theme of modern world history. </p>

<p>The greatest challenge of our time might be extending those same kinds of liberties and ideas to economic policy to fight oligarchs from using money to oppress. It&#39;s a challenge that I think our schools are tackling. Then again, opponents of reform complain about the &quot;liberal bias&quot; of education, so there is clearly some pushback from tackling that particular topic; yet there is some hope it can be defeated as the young are increasingly intolerant of authoritarianism and tend to skew more liberal and libertarian than the previous generation.</p>

<p>Think of today&#39;s economic climate like a game of Monopoly - the state has set up some pretty strong rules to protect the ability of the wealthy to hold their assets. Welfare is like passing go to collect $200...it helps, but it&#39;s not enough to get the losing players back in the game. This will continue until one player takes all the money from the other players (increasing income inequality) within the scope of the game, the losing players band together to make new house rules (reform) or someone will flip the board and end the game (revolution.) Most of the players are to the point where they&#39;re not happy with losing, so it&#39;s getting close to decision time about how the rest of the game is going to go. I&#39;m pretty sure we know enough from school that we realize Monopoly is not a fair and fun game, so we&#39;re not going to just let the game finish with one person holding all the Monopoly money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem I see here is that people can&#39;t tell the difference between what is real and what it not. </p>

<p>For every conspiracy out there, a blogger, website, author, talk show host, radio personality is willing to exploit your fears about it for money and fame. </p>

<p>Be leery of people like Alex Jones, Jesse Ventura, David Icke, Jeff Rense, George Noory. These people make a living keeping you irrational and afraid of things that aren&#39;t true, or distorted just enough to fit your belief system.  </p>

<p>Alex Jones has been saying Martial Law is right around the corner since the 90&#39;s. </p>

<p>David Icke wants you to believe he is the son of God, and that our politicians are reptilian aliens.</p>

<p>I could go on an on about how these people exploit others for a living. </p>

<p>My argument is that the conspiracy is not obvious, because it&#39;s become a mythology in itself. So distorted, so convoluted conspiracy has become a culture in itself. A religion even, where challenging the gospel of the aforementioned people will be met with irrational fervor and attacks against me for even daring to challenge conspiracy dogma. </p>

<p>And I say bring it on, better to shine light on what is real and what is not than to go on believing in bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never knew that someone above me in the hierarchical ladder is immediately an evil slave driver and I am a slave.</p>

<p>I never knew that it is strange that paedophiles in government exist, I always thought the government are run by normal human beings liable to faults and strange sexual interests (paedophilia?) </p>

<p>I never knew that the Queen and Jimmy Saville spent time together! I wonder why? Could it be because they&#39;re hatching some form of evil plot to further the hierarchical gap? That with operation Gladio (Cold war subterfuge is really shady, right?) has to make some form of obvious conspiracy.</p>

<p>I never knew that order = enslavement. I&#39;m sorry that you guys feel that way.</p>

<p>Also, on a side note, what&#39;s censored about the history taught in government run schools, is it different from history taught in other schools? I just want to know because I&#39;m sending my kid to secondary school soon (I live in Australia by the way.).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fellow aussie here. I think aus schools just don&#39;t have time to teach the important stuff. The syllabus is so big that they have to skim over everthing. Check out Crash Course, Minute Physics and Vsauce youtube channels. they are fantastic resources especially Crash Course. There are heaps of others but I&#39;ve found that supplementing the curriculum with outside resources helps expand critical thinking skills and the ability to ask intelligent questions. Good luck mate!</p>

<p>P.S. Aus schools definitely censor Aboriginal history and European settlement. Also they teach nothing about tax, banking systems or the property market.  </p>

<p>Totally agree. I should&#39;ve been more clear - I&#39;m talking about a mental/spiritual revolution, not a violent one. We are the ones who collectively manifested this system (as I said, the masses don&#39;t want to take full responsibility and thus want to live in a controlled environment.) </p>
