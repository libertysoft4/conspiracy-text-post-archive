<p>In this book he will go over a preferred reading list as well. Your choice of magic is up to you I prefer the Enochian only because I saw this sigil <a href="https://38.media.tumblr.com/97c9f4c2e15a3c651e177fae7e8e3920/tumblr_mypz74HWFw1sgmuomo1_500.gif">https://38.media.tumblr.com/97c9f4c2e15a3c651e177fae7e8e3920/tumblr_mypz74HWFw1sgmuomo1_500.gif</a> during a very intense mushroom trip/ meditation. I experienced this sigil in 3rd and 4th dimensions, I had NEVER seen this before or knew anything about magic. When I saw that sigil my mouth dropped I had ONLY experienced it that one time. A demon did end up on the side of my house afterwards it lifted an industrial size trash lid and smelled like death and rot. My intent was this &quot;Whether gods or demons show up I demand to know the truth behind human history.&quot; I then started meditating on gaining universal knowledge of human origin. I then saw this thing with my eyes closed and it was a real polygonal shaped thing spinning in multiple directions, impossible motions (4d). It left 3 toed imprints in front of my garbage can. Cat  was freaking the fuck out at the 2nd story window where this thing came from. He has not in 1.5 years done that before or since. </p>

<p>SO yeah magic is real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have meditated for 30 years but this was the first and last time I went into the 4th dimension on mushrooms. How I knew it was the 4th dimension I smoked DMT and saw this space. Also how the geometry  moved was impossible in 3d reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I have no formal training in the occult, I genuinely believe that there is a connection between matter and pattern in this world. IMO the universe operates on grid systems, and human minds (among others, possibly) are actually conduits between this world and others. By focusing on certain patterns and holding their conjoining pairs in our minds, I think there is a means by which we are able to subtly affect our world via intention.</p>

<p>I think that a lot of the real power of these subtle magics come from two sources: Architecture and Tabula Rasa. The architecture of cathedrals and other similar structures are designed to harness the intentions of the masses within, and project those intentions over a greater area. Because everything is interconnected, irrespective of scale, these intentions can even be harvested and refocused in different locations, and these places are where broader outcomes/expectations can be forced upon the world. Architectural magic seems to be the most subtle, and requires a great deal of public control and investment in infrastructure in order to pull off. The second form involves taking advantage of tabula rasa, or &quot;blank slates&quot;, in order to reinforce the intentions of a group. Children and infants most likely have a stronger connection to higher worlds, as their perceptions and expectations have not been significantly weighed down by indoctrination. By sacrificing children or otherwise indoctrinating them into these systems, the children act as primary conduits between this world and others.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of hard to believe that there are people harvesting prayers and sacrificing children on altars in order to subtly influence the world, but I find these outcomes more acceptable than the thought of people in powerful positions doing these same kinds of things for shits and giggles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for bringing up the architecture. The fact that ancient cultures around the planet all independently built specific structures that are mathematically, geographically, and astronomically significant is pretty amazing. Hunter gather societies and the very first city based civilizations built these pyramids and stone structures in the Americas, Africa, and Europe. </p>

<p>They knew more than we give them credit for definitely.</p>

<p>Interesting shit.... Especially considering the Freemasonry design of the nation&#39;s capital and what not. I saw a picture of the dome at the Vatican and the US capital in DC. The way the dome shaped structures face the obelisk and the the way the lines seem to appear from the architecture is damn near identical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They weren&#39;t hunter gatherers. They lived a sedentary lifestyle around that time due to the uprising of agriculture.</p>

<p>What everyone must understand though, is how the world all received the information on how to farm. This is incredibly advanced stuff, like within the last 100 years we&#39;ve finally made some huge leaps in genetics. </p>

<p>What is also nuts, is that the architecture, being somewhat different also has similarities. Such as every early civilization built pyramids, also these usually involved mathematics/astrology/astronomy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There ya go. That other guy got it. They can lure ya with &quot;white&quot; magic and shit. Make ya think you&#39;re doing good. Magic all has the same source, and it&#39;s not of God. God says don&#39;t fuck with magic. And ppl point out, &quot;well, Solomon conferred with a witch!&quot; yeah, and he fucked up in other arenas, too. Proof being the wisest man that was or will be still doesn&#39;t make you infalibale. Anyways, back to point, don&#39;t drink blood, either. That&#39;s not good for alot of reasons. Don&#39;t kill babies. Yes, they think sacraficing innocent life gives them power. They literally burn babies at thier wicked ceromonies while speaking with demons. In 3 days this will take place under the blood moon in iceland, and it&#39;s members only.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Magic is the internal belief that you can alter Yahweh&#39;s pattern and or &quot;tap into&quot; Spirit through an external means. It was written &quot; For the wrath of YAHWEH  is revealed from heaven against all wickedness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;19 Because that which may be known of YAHWEH is manifest in them; for YAHWEH hath shewed it unto them. 20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and supernal nature; so that they are without excuse: 21 Because that, when they knew YAHWEH , they glorified him not as Elohim, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. 22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, 23 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible Elohim into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. 24 Wherefore YAHWEH also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: 25 Who changed the truth of YAHWEH  into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. 26 For this cause YAHWEH  gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. 28 And even as they did not like to retain YAHWEH  in their knowledge, YAHWEH  gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; 29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, 30 Backbiters, haters of YAHWEH , despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 31 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: 32 Who knowing the judgment of YAHWEH, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.&quot; That pretty well sums up what magic is...</p>

It has a really competitive scene and some really big global tournaments online and offline with prize money and everything. It&#39;s a fun game.</p>

<p>Edit: In all seriousness I&#39;m not so sure about magic being real, but I am quite sure things in the &#39;kinesis family are viable with practice. Particularly Aerokinesis which I believe to have genuinely witnessed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aerokinesis is the mental control over air. My entire life growing up from like 5 years old to even now (20 years old) I&#39;ve been able to sit quietly someplace and just focus on the air around me to push specific leaves on the ground or stop wind from blowing in a specific area all together. It isn&#39;t a lot, but their is 100% some sort of energy control there. I&#39;ve also met a few people who could do this as well. It&#39;s nothing crazy to like create a tornado, but it&#39;s enough to get a damn kite off the ground. I live in a really weird town in central new york where a lot of hippies and weird gypsy people live.</p>

<p>I remember talking to this elderly woman when I was probably in middle-school who talked about all sorts of &#39;kinesis abilities and that every person alive has a specific element they have some amount of control over just by thinking of it and visualizing that element bending to their will. It&#39;s quite possible it was all just a lot of coincidence, like a hell of a lot of coincidence throughout my life, but their hasn&#39;t been one time I haven&#39;t been able to make the air around me outside not do <em>something</em> I wanted by just focusing on it.</p>

<p>EDIT: I also saw this really old chinese dude set paper on fire by just holding it in his hand and said it was pyrokinesis. I&#39;m 100% certain that there is some sort of elemental energy that flows through everyone that they just need to tap into. Videos on similar things aren&#39;t terribly hard to find either.</p>

Ive done different manipulations on the smoke in an air tight room and ive had groups of people focus on it and it makes the smoke &quot;whip out&quot; hearts its interesting.
