        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">205</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-03-17 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/-SPIRITUAL-GANGSTER-.html">-SPIRITUAL-GANGSTER-</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The thread in question:</p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2za9d9/usa_today_the_white_house_is_removing_a_federal/">USA Today: &quot;The White House is removing a federal regulation that subjects its Office of Administration to the Freedom of Information Act, making official a policy under Presidents Bush and Obama to reject requests for records to that office.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Some highlights:</p>

<p><a href="/u/Molag_Balls">/u/Molag_Balls</a> - We rail against extremism abroad yet we fail to see our particular brand of extremism here in the US: Extreme Nationalism. It&#39;s astonishing to me how people in my country can look at Chinese institutional nationalism, or North Korean dictatorial nationalism and be disgusted, but fail to recognize the social pressure-based and indoctrinational nationalism that is bred in the US. We have to be PROUD of everything America has done and what it will do in the future. We&#39;re the GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH. We have more FREEDOM than any other country can shake a stick at. Don&#39;t you know about THE AMERICAN DREAM? The cost of that pride is complete blindness to the festering rot embedded in our society. Shitty healthcare, racism, poverty, income inequality, money in politics, all of it. We&#39;re blind to the big picture and we&#39;re complacent even when we see pieces of it. No politician is going to proffer the revolution that many of us feel is needed. They&#39;re too concerned with what particular trite platform-du-jour they&#39;re going to run on. Even the politicians who do have our best interests at heart give us the same overused spiel whenever they&#39;re asked what we can do. &quot;Get out there and VOTE! (for me!)&quot;. They&#39;re already invested in the way things are, just like the rest of us, so of course they&#39;re not going to give any other advice. I don&#39;t know where I&#39;m going with this rant anymore, but I know one thing: There are some seriously broken parts of this country and there are fixes for them out there somewhere. I don&#39;t know who is going to find them, or even if they will be found, but those fixes couldn&#39;t come soon enough.</p>

<p><a href="/u/RealChangeUSA">/u/RealChangeUSA</a> - We have food and entertainment. We feel as though we are fighting towards a better future in our country when we vote either democrat or republican, or when we debate the merits of religion and abortion and immigration and any number of silly issues with obvious answers, when the reality is the parties are two sides of the same fucked up coin. Most of us don&#39;t really worry about what we say online, because the police aren&#39;t dragging our neighbors out of their homes yet without explanation. Except they are. They can take your money and possessions, they can kick in your door and drag you out of your home without explanation and if you decided to fight back, you would be a deadly threat and a criminal and a terrorist. you can be locked up without trial, tortured, executed. The majority of the things you have ever said or typed or texted to a friend can used as evidence against you in a trial that none of your peers will witness. And we do have to watch what we say online. We don&#39;t feel like we can change things, we know they are getting worse, but most people will wait because they feel that waiting is the safest option. And then one day they won&#39;t have food and entertainment anymore, and then people will make things change because they finally won&#39;t feel like they have what they need to survive and they will not be afraid of dying to improve their situation because their situation is a death sentence anyway. People will have to live in fear before a real percentage of them want to change things in this country, which is a sickening and shameful thing because we are giving away what hundreds of thousands of Americans quite literally fought and died for. People lost their families (in some cases fought and killed members of their own families, they killed their brothers and father&#39;s for these rights) and died painful, agonizing deaths for things we don&#39;t think are a big deal to give up anymore. Edit: People have already been forced out of our country, arrested, killed and branded terrorists for trying to change things in this day and age, and even in this year. Terrorists are subjective- that&#39;s why it&#39;s such a dangerous word. The founding fathers, our most esteemed war heros, the faces on Mount Rushmore were all terrorists to someone. But they are heros to us because they risked their lives and died to give hundreds of millions of people a chance for a safer existence , free from the fear of an overzealous government or government entity controlling their short lives, and to give people for hundreds of years with the ability to try and improve their lives as much as possible. Most of our lives don&#39;t last long enough to do very much at all, and that&#39;s alright, that&#39;s how the world works. But shouldn&#39;t we be free to do and say as we please without fear and with hope that we can improve our place in society during the short time we have?</p>

<p><a href="/u/Kenny_Login">/u/Kenny_Login</a> - This isn&#39;t 1984, it&#39;s Brave New World. 1984 was about control of the population by legislating thoughts and emotions. What we have is over-saturation of information to the point where we can&#39;t tell what&#39;s important and what&#39;s not.
Ex: The biggest story this month has been Hillary&#39;s e-mail. The whole time, legislation is being pushed through to decrease transparency. The story wasn&#39;t Hillary&#39;s e-mail, but we missed it. Now it&#39;s too late. Both sides of the isle agree to this and they take turns being the punching bag, while they&#39;re clearly all friends just trying to keep their jobs in Congress. Whether it&#39;s Bridgegate or Benghazi, what we should have been absolutely focused on was stuff like Cispa, Keystone-X, corporate welfare, and government spying, but we were too distracted by non-issues because that&#39;s all the major news organizations will cover (and there is your 1984 moment. News organizations working for and with the federal government)
1984 is great, definitely read it, but be sure to check out Huxley&#39;s Brave New World
Both are literary masterpieces.</p>

<p>Not to mention, <a href="/u/fuck_all_mods">/u/fuck_all_mods</a>&#39; amazing, well-sourced piece was reposted, receiving 3100+ and gilded 5x.</p>

<p>This is one of the liveliest, and more important, <em>realistic</em> comment threads I&#39;ve ever seen on reddit. Users were genuinely interesting in talking about the problems we&#39;re facing instead of being bogged down in partisan and social rhetoric.</p>

<p>Does anyone else feel like something&#39;s in the air?</p>

<p>I say don&#39;t get down, for every Kardashian watching sheep there is an intelligent person who is waking up to the tyranny of the system we&#39;re stuck in.</p>

<p>People are waking up whether they know it or not. Almost no one is happy with the government these days. Things like the war on drugs are widely being seen as a waste of time and money and an affront to human rights.
We&#39;re getting there slowly.</p>

<p>People are starting to take the bullshit less seriously</p>

<p>This is a good way to put it. We have been conditioned to think we live in a free society but people are starting to actulaly step back and think about what that means.</p>

<p>We are no longer content to just claim we are free, people actually want to feel it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s where I start to get hopeful.  Now that more and more people are becoming awake as to what &quot;National Security&quot; actually means, we should work to help them identify the advent of using &quot;national security&quot; to do illegal and immoral things.</p>

<p>The families who created &quot;national security&quot; as an excuse to stage an &quot;intervention&quot; are the same people perpetrating this tyranny on us today.</p>

<p>edit:  as a somewhat related aside, I have been wondering lately if we are seeing Rex 84 happen in slow motion.  We often think that it will be one traumatic event, but what if they just slowed it down and boiled you like a frog?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There’s a wonderful book, by the way, I’m reading called Family of Secrets by…Russ Baker. He spent many years on it. And it’s a family — forgive me, Bushes and Bushettes — a family of criminals. Why they’re not all in jail I don’t know. If I seem a little dazed, I’ve been reading about their crimes, and proposed crimes, and how they got away with it.</p>

<p>I agree.  I don&#39;t think people are actually that stupid.  I think everyone, for the most part, knows &quot;what is going on&quot;.  </p>

<p>The issue is that if people actually admitted it to themselves, then they will be bound by their conscience to do something about it and put themselves at risk.</p>

<p>Not only that but all mortgage loans that I&#39;m aware of front-load all of the interest. <a href="http://thismatter.com/money/real-estate/images/mortgage-payments-interest-principal-portions.gif">You&#39;re only paying a small % of principal down for almost the first half of the loan</a>.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s awful. If you pay it off early you shouldn&#39;t have to pay all that interest. It&#39;s supposed to accumulate over the lifetime of the loan, not before you&#39;ve even started paying!</p>

<p>So if you buy a house for $200,000 with a loan, put $50,000 into it, and then sell it for $200,000, you get almost nothing back? The banks don&#39;t just double or triple their money over those 30 years, but if the property keeps changing hands they get way more than that?</p>

<p>I already was irritated that these 30 year loans were raising the price of houses because people could &quot;afford&quot; a more expensive house if it took 30 years to repay it. They think, &quot;It&#39;s cheaper than rent!&quot; not about how much they&#39;re really paying. So anyone who would want to pay cash or just take out a (relatively) short loan is stuck with a housing market that&#39;s over-inflated because everyone else is willing to pay out the ass for their home.</p>

<p>And somehow people see rising house prices as a good thing! I guess if you don&#39;t get any money back when you sell otherwise, even if the price doesn&#39;t drop from when you bought it, that would explain it.</p>

<li>Make a comment.</li>
<li>Cite all your sources directly, integrate them into the text.</li>
<li>Make it satirical</li>

<p>You will have your voice heard, the good thing about shills is that they can&#39;t back their lies with sources, so every time a shill make a comment, just reply to him and ask [citation needed] and continue asking it, till they give up.</p>
