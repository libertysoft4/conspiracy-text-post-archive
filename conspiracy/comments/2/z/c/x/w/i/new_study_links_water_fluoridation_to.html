<p>Confirms what I said. Last time it took me two hours to gather and post all the links and information and I got a total of one upvote out of it. I wonder whether nobody is reading and following the links, whether it takes its time to react or if it is that nobody really cares about this topic. I just do not get it, because I though <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was interested in this. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2xtbzm/russia_is_invading_ukraine_today_russian_jets_are/cp4qh8z">Here is again summerized 6 years of my personal research in these posts.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes thank you. I have recently done the same [Kelp from GNC] and I have lost 20 lbs in a month. I also modified my diet slightly, so I can&#39;t say the Iodine was the only factor. I still eat poorly [inexpensively] a lot of the time.</p>

<p>The telltale sign for me was that the first 3 days I was supplementing with it, I was positively &quot;buzzing&quot; and anxious, lots of nervous energy which I eventually settled into. No other significant changes were made during that time.</p>

<p>Anyone who reads this do some research about Iodine supplementation. You don&#39;t strictly want Iodine, you want to add some minerals [the least obvious being Selenium] as well.</p>

<p>If you truly are Iodine deficient, you will go through a &quot;Detox&quot; phase as other Halogens [Bromine] are flushed out of your system and replaced by the Iodine. This can make you feel ill, but it will pass after a week.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post made my head hurt. </p>

<p>Assuming you are either average, or even marginally overweight, losing 20 pounds (of bodyfat) in a month is physically impossible. Now, you never claimed it was bodyfat. But you also said you only slightly modified your diet, and you still ate poorly. So it stands to reason you didn&#39;t do a ~7500kcal a week deficit which is the maximum for healthy fat loss, and you couldn&#39;t possibly have lost that much water weight either. </p>

<p>So basically this is a shitpost, you didn&#39;t properly gauge or define your weight loss at all, just made an absurd statement and implied it was because of supplementing Iodine. Posts like this are exactly what we <em>dont</em> need on this sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been on the road and using scales along the way, however I benchmarked 2 different ones. My ideal weight is probably 165, but my weight for the last 20 years has been 180-190. I weighed in at 216 a month ago and am down in the high 190 lb range presently. My muscle mass is similar, the weight came from my midsection. </p>

<p>It is possible I was retaining water, however I definitely measured that much loss.</p>

<p>Edit: in the same time period I have been supplementing DHEA and I stopped drinking Diet Coke. There was a period of time where I was eating a 2 big mac special about 3 times a week on the way to work and now I avoid McDonalds completely, but not all fast food. [though I have cut out french fries]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was an article in my local paper yesterday about fluoride that makes me sick.  Doctors and physicians are lying straight to the public while the local politicians are trying to prevent fluoride from being used again; its feels completely backwards (in a good way, the sicken part is what the doctors and dentist are saying, the great part is the local politicians speaking truth).  There are 45 doctors and dentists in my area trying to get the small towns to start fluoridating the water again.  The communities blocked the attempt in 2005 but they are complaining that there has been an increase in cavities.  This has to do with less fluoride and not more sugar and sweets /s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tell me about it.

<p>I&#39;m almost 40, I have rotten teach that hurt everyday and no money to treat them and no Thyroid since three years ago. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t drink our tap water and don&#39;t allow my kids to either since it&#39;s full of fluoride and so much chlorine the water stinks. </p>

<p>The thing that always stuns me is how some people place such a high bar for <em>proof that Fluoride is damaging</em>, and how low a bar they put for <em>proof that Fluoride is safe</em>.</p>
