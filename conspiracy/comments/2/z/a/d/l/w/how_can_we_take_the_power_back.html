I don&#39;t know how to fight back against our government because well, I&#39;m young and i live in a small town in
the central valley of California and there isn&#39;t exactly alot of protests to join.I talk alot
of revolution and I try to bring up recent events to show my friends that our government is
evil but no one except the bassist in my band gives a damn. All I get is,&quot;I don&#39;t care about politics&quot;. Everyone around me 
agressivley refuses to wake up no matter how much I try. I&#39;m very frustrated with the
government and frustrated with myself for that matter. Other than signing online petitions at ACLU.org or
white house.gov that I know don&#39;t do anything, I don&#39;t know how to take action and dammit I&#39;m going to take action.
So r/conspiracy, any suggestions on how to fight back?</p>

<p>The government instituted by the American Revolution was overturned within two decades. Have we all forgotten how the Articles of Confederation were replaced - quite illegally - by a &quot;conspiracy&quot; of federalists that wanted a powerful central government?</p>

<p>The ink on the Constitution was barely dry when the people revolted against the federal government&#39;s taxes - the &quot;Whiskey Rebellion.&quot;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not even mention the Civil War.</p>

<p>You never had any power to &quot;take back.&quot; That was just propaganda. Sorry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had to make sure I didn&#39;t make this comment.</p>

<p>The Constitutional Convention many patriots use to deify the Founding Fathers was actually a meeting, *in secret, with private security, consisting of the 1% of the day (lawyers, land/slave owners, bankers, etc).</p>

<p>George Washington was arguably the richest man in the country at the time due to his days speculating land for the Virginia Company.</p>

<p>It was called in part due to a rebellion in Western Massachusetts by Daniel Shays and a group of Rev War veterans in debt up to their eyeballs due to taxes (that they thought they were fighting for). Carl Van Dorn has some interesting ideas and books that surmise (my analysis incoming) that the British knew what was coming, ams the Shays Rebellion/Constitutional Convention was a Hegelian Dialectic move of the most epic proportions.</p>

<p>If anyone wants to go down this rabbit hole, let me know. Madison&#39;s notes on the convention (published 50 years later) are a great starting point, as well as Sources Of The Constitution by Stevens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Research and learn the ways of local government and popular-vote organizations. Seemingly small scale decisions can have a big impact on local communities. In most cities and towns, popular political action is rare and it&#39;s a small group of citizens regularly attending city council meetings and making a difference. With the right research and public speaking skills, you can bring awareness to problems (no matter how small) and push for action. </p>

<p>An example is the anti-fluoride movement, interest groups are present in many communities and some have successfully removed fluoride from their water systems. There are many other interest groups you can pursue, they are not well known because of the public&#39;s ADD and lack of care but those are the &quot;pros&quot; of these groups, the masses of <del>zombies</del> consumers are too busy watching CNN to stand in your way. </p>

<p>The political process is dying as long as people continue to ignore the importance of small government in the Corporate States of America. The powers delegated to municipal government are the ones we should hold onto and won&#39;t be bought out so easily. </p>

<p>Embrace this ability when you reach voting age. I wish I had the time now to participate in local meetings. I plan to in the near future. </p>

<p>As far as conspiracies go, don&#39;t let them eat away at you. It is an important skill to be skeptical at what is given to you and to be able to research for the truth on your own. Bring others who can think like you can along the way but don&#39;t get stuck on those who won&#39;t budge. The stubborn will either find their way or just blend in with the 90% of careless citizens who just browse dank memes. </p>

<p>Focus on what you can do well independently and with others (it sounds like a band, definitely roll with that, I regret giving up on mine), not what you can&#39;t do because of the TPTB. Feeling powerless will diminish your will to live, this happens the farther you go down the rabbit hole without looking back at the light. Find what you do well and are passionate about and do it. Take occasional breaks from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, we&#39;ll always be here when you get back. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are so many things you can do. I believe your generation has the advantage to change the world.</p>

<p>People listen to a group of kids. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my 2 cents. </p>

<p>Pick a couple simple topics, and educate people.t</p>

<p>I think people only listen if they can change something.
Stay away from fear. People get normalcy bias when stuff seems too deep. </p>

<p>Starting a civil rights team at your school would be great. 
Couple flyers on what students rights are, maybe have a civil rights attorney speak or help develop a one page information flyer on how to protect yourself legally as a teen.</p>

<p>They probably don&#39;t know their rights. </p>

<p>Also, dosomething.org could be a good resource.</p>

<p>Anti-bullying/a call to men/no more.org</p>

<p>I looked into the legal rights of my hs student, and the school policy and how it relates to the kids, I was shocked. My son&#39;s school was trampling kids rights. </p>

<p>The kids I talked to were excited to know what was up. </p>

<p>If you could get some muffins and coffee, bring people together, teach them something that benefits them, win/win. 
Just keep it really simple. Have a mission statement, and stick to it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m getting ready to go all caps...fair warning...</p>

<p>GOOD FOR YOU.  People like you WILL save humanity.</p>

<p>I&#39;m with you 100%. If I can help in any way, I would be honored. </p>

<p>You have the power to change SO much. </p>

<p>Dream big.   Start small, stay focused, have fun. </p>

<p>Enthusiasm is contagious. It may take 1 meeting with one person, the next, five. </p>

<p>Keep your vision clear.   </p>

<p>Mad love. xx</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So...I&#39;m feeling kinda compelled here to create some type of simple effective activism for teens 101. </p>

<p>I know we are all in different places...my particular experience is this:</p>

<p>I woke up at 43, and it scared me to death. I woke up my son (15 then, now 17) and by default, he experienced first hand power abuse, and the dissolution of civil rights. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my point- </p>

<p>I am deeply concerned about kids like OP and my son. 
They are in the minority. Critical time for teens to feel empowered. They feel disconnected/afraid/powerless/angry. (Assumption)</p>

<p>Anyone choosing to do anything to change the social climate, I applaud. Otherwise, what&#39;s the point. Ffs, if we can&#39;t change anything, then what&#39;s the point..???? That would drive me crazy. </p>

<p>tl/dr should we provide some type of teen activism group for truthers? I believe it&#39;s necessary, and effective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think just focusing on empowering them to take some local control is a good idea.</p>

<p>A local gardening/victory garden club? Learning student&#39;s rights? Privacy rights? Big Data? </p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t give a fuck about that shit when I was 14. Imagine if just a few knew enough that they can organize against this PARC test/common core thing? That would be <em>amazing</em>, and it really just starts with engaging a few young adults and picking their brains.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t have to be anything near conspiratorial. Those rabbit holes are not for this age cohort (IMO). What matters is that they are aware of the solutions that will lead to more, not less freedoms. And that starts with engaging the communities again, especially with the youth.</p>

<p>My students are in their mid-twenties and still don&#39;t know shit, but they have potential. But the adolescents? They already got a rebellious phase coming (I know I had one). </p>

<p>But if you can point that towards the solutions that lead to big changes, incrementally - that&#39;s the solution (IMO).</p>

<p>TPTB have been playing a long game. Maybe it&#39;s time to start a mid-range action plan ourselves.</p>

<p>If he&#39;s as awake as be says he is, no, you cannot. Scared? Sure. Doesn&#39;t mean you have to revert and go back to the typical behavior.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nah. Not an option.</p>

<p>It can be, to an extent. There&#39;s no point at this stage in life to start acquiring labels (troublemaker/etc). This kid has a 20 year start on a lot of us here. Imagine what he/she can read, learn, understand, and do? Sky&#39;s the fucking limit. But that does mean for awhile you need to slowly and silently educate yourself, and try and drop some hints at those that trust him to start looking at things differently (his/our way).</p>

<p>Can still go to base ball games, the movies, etc. Just chuckle at the anthem and the fly-bys before the first pitch, and chuckle at the propagandain the cinema (and try and discuss it afterwards).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Live life as you want to live it and be an example to your friends.  The more you realize how little &#39;they&#39; actually affect your day to day life the better.  </p>

<p>Make a list of all of the things you wanted to do today, and compare that to a list of things you actually did.  How many things were you prevented from doing because of the government?  How many things were you forced to do against your will by government?  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not your job to wake people up.  If you force your beliefs on other people you&#39;re no different then the government you fight against.</p>

<p>Your job is to be the person you want to be regardless of government or any other circumstance, and to be there for anyone who comes to you for help.
If you truly live free and set a good example people who want to be awoken will find you.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget to be 14.  Chase girls, play music, etc.  Just be free and have as much fun as you possibly can.  Don&#39;t do anything that would seriously jeopardize your future, but take advantage of the awesomeness that is youth cause once it&#39;s gone, it&#39;s gone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Resistance. </p>

<p>This is farfetched, but if every citizen in the USA wouldn&#39;t go to work, buy anything, use their car,  social media, etc. for one day, the cards would topple. </p>

<p>If we use the matrix they&#39;ve rigged against them, they&#39;d crumble. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>keep being, or be, a bat shit crazy conspiracy motherfucker, you&#39;r a teenager, you get to be crazy, and you&#39;r in the system, expose the lies where they are created. When your class is being taught about democracy be that kid who stands up and asks, really? Are we free because we can drop a piece of paper in a box every 4th year? When you learn about the middle east, be that kid who makes a presentation about the petro dollar, hell, show the bombing of baghdad and ask &quot;are these people terrorists? Did they bomb the WTC towers? Did those 1 million civilians that we have killed over the last 14 years deserve to die?&quot;. Make it bloody obvious.</p>

<p>Expose the lies kid, keep exposing the lies, show people how fucked up the system are. Give your class mates some real education when the are getting educated, cause your teacher wont.</p>

<p>Remember this article: <a href="http://asheepnomore.net/2015/03/16/revolution-mind/">http://asheepnomore.net/2015/03/16/revolution-mind/</a>  and remember to also be normal once in a while, keep playing in your band and don&#39;t forget to enjoy life.</p>
