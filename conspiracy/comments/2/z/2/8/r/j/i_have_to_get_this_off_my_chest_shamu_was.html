        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In 1970 I was working for the Sea World entertainment company in San Diego, California.  Our top performer was a female orca called Shamu.  We often drugged her to control her during preformances.  While I was there we were shooting a promotional advertisement for Daltston Advertising, for an Sea World entertainment television ad.  The female model was injured by Shamu.  Months later, due to liability issues we couldn&#39;t use her in any shows and she was costing us more than $500 a day to feed and store.  Also we were afraid of civil ligitation and Shamu being alive was a constant reminder to the potential plaintiff of what happened.  In early August 1971, the vice president of operations and I injected several bottles of anti freeze into the GI tracts of dead fish and fed them to Shamu killing her.  To the media we reported her dying from a natural death. I have felt guilt from this event for years.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>To be fair, I&#39;ve seen people give preferential treatment to animals,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course.  Me too.  I&#39;m actually one of the type that tend to give preferential treatment to non-human animals over human animals.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter though.  I and people like me are WAAAYYYY in the minority, and most of us in the human species kill and torture non-human animals incessantly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and be absolutely vile towards humans. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Being absolutely vile toward <em>anyone</em> is not a good thing.  That is, however, besides the point that&#39;s being made here that, by and large, the human race overall acts pretty despicably toward the non-human race.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I guess ultimately it boils down to the individuals. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On one level, it definitely seems to - yes.  On another level, there really is just SOOOO much negativity that human beings are indeed responsible for toward non-human beings, that I would imagine that any being who isn&#39;t human and doesn&#39;t know much about humanity and who is on the outside looking in on human civilization might think &quot;These beings seem to regularly kill <em>everything</em> that is not them.  There seem to be some that <em>don&#39;t</em> do that, but there are definitely more members in this race that do engage in this despicable activity than there are those that don&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p>As such, I wouldn&#39;t think it too unjustified if this hypothetical being came to the conclusion that humans &quot;overall&quot; were just aggressive, violent things that killed everything in their path.</p>

I hope (if this story is true) that you have been able to make peace with yourself, take a step back and realize it is life and our relationships through life (human or animal), that truly give us our riches.

While many animals in zoos are not as content as they would be in nature, the education and advocacy that the public receives through zoos is invaluable.
