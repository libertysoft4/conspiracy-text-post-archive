It is why love became a weakness and ego became a strength.  Ego is controlled programming, love is pure freedom. Freedom from judgement, ownership. law, authority. LOVE is true freedom.  Why do you think so many people only think of love as in relationships and then their egos ruin the relationship leaving them miserable.  They don&#39;t want you happy and in love.  They want you afraid.  DON&#39;T BE, YOU ARE ALL MASTER CREATORS.  <a href="/r/LOVEWINS">/r/LOVEWINS</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anything that can enhance the human experience and bring more joy is always good.  Although a lot of man made drugs can alter brain waves, cause brain damage, and put holes in your brain. So even though it may bring you temporary joy it&#39;ll bring you long term misery. Love would never do that to itself knowingly.  This is why most love beings stick to natural chemical compounds sounds as THC, CBD, and DMT.  DMT is found in everything, but I prefer the shroom way of receiving my dosage of pure pineal cleansing power. A good way to see through the illusion and discover the truth in our world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL this guy is so scared you might discover the truth here he will do anything to tarnish it.  Yes I do work for the Galactic Federation of Light, we are the First Contact Ground Crew Team.  We are preparing the collective consciousness for a shift in energies.  We must prepare them before we come in with the 5D energies.  So come visit us anytime you like at <a href="/r/LOVEWINS">/r/LOVEWINS</a> because nothing can STOP LOVE not even government trolls like Howard Johnson who are so scared of truth they spit on it when they see it.  Everything comes back to us ten fold, it is why I always give love.  I love you Howard Johnson, you know not what you do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I work with them all the time.  In fact everyone on my love team has had some kind of issue or another.  See you THINK about all the problems, you don&#39;t FOCUS on the cure, the love, the cleansing.  If you want to help people you show them LOVE, COMPASSION, EMPATHY.  It is simple, people need love not pills, not shrinks who know how to fuck with the mind.  You need LOVE, love is the cure. </p>

<p>Another thing you are not picking up on is there is never going back.  See you want to help people but you believe they will relapse.  You see we create our own realities.  If you wish that on someone, you are basically throwing daggers at their love. YOU have to believe in people.  You have little faith in anyone, because you have little faith in you.  You are a reflection of everything around you and everything around you is a reflection of you.  So what you cast on others is how you feel about your self.  It is why I always show love and compassion, even to those little ego&#39;s out there who love to argue semantics because their brain can&#39;t let go of an old authoritative programmed responses.  You let go of the old, to move forward. How can you go with the flow, if you hold on to so much that is behind you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like you refuse to fix it and just keep feeding it energy.  You create the reality you live in. So what do you want love or rapist?  You sound like you have a lot to let go of.  I was raped as a child and I forgive my rapist, I was raped as a teen and forgave my raper.  I was sent to war by the same cabal that printed the bible you speak of and yet I forgave the cabal. So love wins and forgives.  You have a lot to learn about love. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a lot to learn about responcibility. Do you know what punishment is? Or should people get away with everything? So what is your definition of justice. Can we just forgive and forget? I doubt that seriously. I have forgiven plenty but there is unforgiveable acts in this world, the majority of which are done bt TPTB and those who support this regime. I may be one cold hearted mother fucker but i have been in the trenches of life the entire time. It is no easy task to see realitt as it truely is. The dark disgusting twisted shit hole existence with scant harmony left. If you wish to think that way fine but i do not agree. Love is a fical thing that i have seen come and go. Its never a full fledged solution because it just does not last. I hope you can learn something from this and i hope for myself that maybe I one day can imagine that your view point is possible but for this momment that is impossible. </p>

<p>Stop lifting those weights - set it down! Stop working and fighting! Just LOVE!</p>

<p>We have a whole political culture based around being against &quot;hate.&quot; </p>

<p>Zionist groups like the $outhern Poverty Law Center - who are &quot;against hate&quot; and &quot;for love&quot; actually just pick out various people with political opinions and label them as &quot;hate.&quot;</p>

<p>Then they use &quot;love&quot; - or other glittering generalities - to promote all sorts of vile shit. Remember, we were &quot;fighting Nazi hate&quot; sometimes then we supported actual &quot;Nazis&quot; - who use Hitler Swastikas and Everything! - in Ukraine to take down a Putin-friendly government.</p>

<p>That was done in the name of &quot;love&quot; too. We were all United Together In A Spirit Of LoveNotHate and helped Nazis Liberate Ukraine From Hateful Putin.</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t you know Putin is against Equality Marriage?</p>

<p>EQUAL = LOVE = HAPPINESS vs. HATE BIGOT NAZI (except sometimes) COMMIE FUNDIE</p>

<p>It&#39;s all pretty silly isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a hint. Not even women who actually watch Oprah actually believe any of that. They are there to look at people&#39;s outfits and gossip about celebrities. Those women don&#39;t actually believes Oprah&#39;s woo-woo New Age &quot;love&quot; crap. That&#39;s just for advertisers.</p>

You are now blessed with your own energies and can no longer spew your hate onto other people.  Your words will fall on deaf ears and their hearts will sing with love.  You will no longer have power over anyone.  You are as it is, surrounded by your own filth.  This week you will see every darkness in you manifest it self in your life, unto you, and never onto anyone else ever again.  This decree is held in the highest accord with love and cannot be broken until you find heart.  Then when you find heart this barrier keeping your &quot;shit&quot; to your self will only fade, it&#39;ll still be there only weakening until you find the love in your life. May all bare witness to you and this divine love that has been granted to help you see the light that is within. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Love cannot be thought about, love cannot be cultivated, love cannot be practised. The practice of love, the practice of brotherhood, is still within the field of the mind, therefore it is not love. When all this has stopped, then love comes into being, then you will know what it is to love. Then love is not quantitative but qualitative. You do not say, &quot;I love the whole world&quot; but when you know how to love one, you know how to love the whole. Because we do not know how to love one, our love of humanity is fictitious. When you love, there is neither one nor many: there is only love. It is only when there is love that all our problems can be solved and then we shall know its bliss and its happiness.&quot; - J.

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody wants what you offer. Easy come easy go. No one wants love from someone they a)don&#39;t know and b) didn&#39;t work for. Love takes effort. Energy. You&#39;re diminishing the true value of the word by giving handouts and snippets of just things that sound nice and wrapping it in the false packaging you call &quot;LOVE&quot;. Frankly you sound like a MiniLove shill if I ever saw one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love you and forgive you. You know not what you do, you are programmed and cannot feel love. This isn&#39;t your fault exactly but you have free will.  Only you can change you.  However we must become the change we want to see in the world.  Your foulness, grotesque views, absurd accusations, insults, dirty talk is an example of why the old ways are not working.  You call me a shrill to get the stink off you.  However you don&#39;t realize, everyone can smell you from a mile away.  You are so angry and at what?  Love?  You are angry because you are trapped in your mind and blame everyone else of your own problems.  You never take responsibility for your energies and how you use them. You&#39;re not being responsible with your energies and it is why you are literally swimming in your own stink right now. Enjoy because I feel absolutely DIVINE and GRAND, and aint no rain gonna stop my love parade. Nothing can diminish the shine on me.  I am super polished and brighter then ever.  Good evening to you. ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re so entirely full of shit. Just because you say the word LOVE a lot doesn&#39;t make you anything. You&#39;re so incredibly blind to how false you come off. Sit down son. You&#39;ve had too much acid. </p>
