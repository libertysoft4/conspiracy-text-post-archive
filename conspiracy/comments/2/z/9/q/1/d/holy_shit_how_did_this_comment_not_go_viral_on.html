<p>It really makes me sad realising that the vast, vast majority of people simply couldn&#39;t care less because it doesn&#39;t directly affect them and even if they did (which 90% of them do) they&#39;re still content going about their lives with their distractions, with their new shiny this and lovely expensive that. </p>

<p>I get the feeling that some do realise what&#39;s going on but it destroys everything they&#39;ve been taught and that the government isn&#39;t the big lovable bear they&#39;ve been conditioned to believe it is. </p>

<p>I really hope there&#39;s light at the end of the tunnel for humanity because otherwise, we&#39;re fucked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m weary though. Why now? Why worldnews which is on total lock whitewash down. And politics too? Those subs are usually really propagandized. The sub Technology tends to mirror a lot of sentiments here on conspiracy, at least with NSA, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a default sub anymore. But I am noticing a huge uptick in &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; posts all over reddit. I personally think it&#39;s to affect cognitive dissonance. I mean, I hardly care about Snowden posts anymore. I saw so much of it. I kept thinking ok ok ok things are ridiculous, but you hear so much stuff that&#39;s all the same flavor eventually you think, nothing is being done about it and stop caring. The other thing was all the police brutality posts cropping up everywhere. When taken together I think the public is being acclimated. When I say public I really mean the reddit demographic, which is broad, but probably share similarities that the government is now actively targeting to influence. What do you guys think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because Reddit is infiltrated, and controled, and biased, and misleaded. If they can set up crazed Arab terrorists and Mexican drug cartels, who chops off people&#39;s head whether using small pocket knives or a chainsaw, on a daily basis. And at the point they don&#39;t care if it was a female politician and/or torture to death their entire family, includes children. All those bizzare and manic fear based mind control schemes. How easy of a task would you think, for them to manipulate Reddit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because this subreddit is mainly centered around lizard-jews and all the other things that have nothing to do with anything important. It&#39;s pretty much just here to act as a ward against anyone taking conspiracy theories seriously on major social networking/media websites. That&#39;s what <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is used for - either by purpose and direction including a few moderators who make sure the wrong things get stickied and the wrong posts stay on the front page(while the right ones are deleted), or just because the most vocal minorities out there have used this as their entry into social media websites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes its absolutely psychological projection onto <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, which just makes us smirk and we have the pleasure of knowing that the person that used that terminology is sadly ill informed or possibly just crazy in their own right. This is my first time to see lizard jew myself. I have been here for over five years, I daily read comments from the top down all the way through new, had anyone one seriously said that and were not in here spying for their controllers, they would be laughed at. Well its kind of funny actually and its so fucking out there no one here is taking any of that shit seriously. So in fact SRS may believe in lizard jews, we do not and have never, for as long as I have been here.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not psychological projection, but it is psychological manipulation.</p>

<p>If I were a government agent tasked with disseminating propaganda, and I wanted to damage the credibility of a forum where my government&#39;s policy is frequently discussed in a negative light, I&#39;d post nothing but schizophrenic ramblings, allegations of lizard aliens infesting government, and Holocaust denials - the kind of things most normal people take one look at, and dismiss as lunacy right away.</p>

<p>Doing this, I discredit the entire forum.</p>

<p>Those guys talking about being gang-stalked by lizard aliens with mind-reading technology are posting from an air force base.</p>
