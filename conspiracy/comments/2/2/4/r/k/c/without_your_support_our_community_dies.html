However you wish to look at it the new submissions queue does not lie and we need our regular(friendly) readers to keep this in mind. Many decent posts are getting hammered with down-votes, admins have been informed and already removed a number of shit-muncher accounts who existed solely to downvote. </p>

<p>We do not expect readers to upvote shite, i down-vote here myself regularly and do not always agree with what is suggested. </p>

<p>That being said many decent posts and contributions are targeted and never get the attention they sometimes deserve and this is where we need to rely on our community. </p>

<p>Please browse the new queue and try to keep relevant and decent material alive. The sub is growing and in light of NSA scandals, Ed Snowden and Media manipulation on so many fronts and regarding many important issues <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has never been more relevant. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t let down-vote brigades rule what is read and what is ignored here and help fight the good fight. </p>

<p>Erdogan asked for a false-flag war against Syria, I&#39;m asking our readers to start an honest war against mindless down-voters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Outsider here. I&#39;ll be honest with you; I disagree with most of the major view points here. But I subbed a while back because I enjoy getting the alternative view it provides. I find a lot of it to be really bizarre, but I also like questioning things recently and I enjoy the perspective you guys provide as I consider myself open to new ideas. I never comment and I rarely vote, either up or down. But I browse the /rising/ queue of my front page, so I see a lot of things here when they&#39;re young. </p>

<p>My opinion as an outsider? You guys are your own worst enemy. I&#39;ll see a title that looks interesting and open it up just to see comments bitching about downvotes and mass brigades and whatnot, or if the theme needs to be changed because a non-truther made it. And maybe that&#39;s just because I&#39;m floating around the rising topics most of the day and don&#39;t often check in on the hot topics. But I&#39;d like to see the intelligent discourse a group such as this could provide, but it&#39;s like threads can rarely get there without tangets about downvote bots. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what the fix is, but it seems like there&#39;s a lot of back and forth here that takes away from the topic at hand and that&#39;s disappointing. Sometimes it seems you guys are more intent on proving some sort of corruption on Reddit instead of looking at the topic itself. If there is indeed a conspiracy to take you guys off topic, I would say it&#39;s working because an outsider like me, someone who&#39;s not a &quot;true believer&quot; isn&#39;t very often coming back to see what made the top threads of the day. </p>

<p>The constant barrage of complaining is off-putting. There are over 200,000 subscribers, but every thread I go into, I have to read about 5 downvotes and how it is an attack?</p>

<p>It has really soured me. I&#39;ll probably be banned for criticizing the subreddit now, but the constant discussion about attacks and censorship completely takes away from trying to discuss actual issues. I find stories every day. Nothing seems to be disappearing. But reading every post, you would think it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your criticism is well crafted even if incorrect, and very respectful even if critical. </p>

<p>You won&#39;t be banned for being a thoughtful commentor.  The people who get banned for being critical of this sub sound like &quot;omg you&#39;re all racist loons!&quot; And &quot;the joos did it!&quot;.</p>

<p>Now the problem we are talking about which isn&#39;t apparent if you browse our front page has to do with new submissions.  People have been getting multiple down votes within seconds of making a new submission.  This is not only frustrating but it messes with thread rankings and makes sure that only low effort posts make it to the front page.</p>

<p>Personally I don&#39;t think that conspiratard is 100% at fault.  We have some political groups in here that are militantly opposed to any post that isn&#39;t sucking the cock of Obama and others who are opposed to anti Republican posts.  We have global warming junkies and other junkies that have strange voting habits (I suspect).</p>

<p>I think we have many problem voters that are problematic for different reasons.</p>

<p>These heavy handed tactics are also something that subscribers rightly criticise about this sub, I didn&#39;t bring it up here before because I thought I would get banned again, &#39;for attacking the sub&#39; or something. I was not ok with what happened despite me saying, it&#39;s cool.</p>

<p>I get that there are some who don&#39;t like this place but I am just a normal guy giving an alternative opinion, not a shill/brigador.  like the op said, the users (and mods) are often their own worst enemy. And they need to realise that, before this sub can improve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll explain this to you simply and clearly once again.  Replying to you in this thread.  Only in this thread.  Challenging you on your highly flawed take on the events.  Calling you our when you speak lies.  None of these things could possible be construed as &quot;stalking&quot; or &quot;harrasment.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s sad to watch the distractors cry when they horribly botch their stated objective.  When they are not able to trust, turn, or distract from the damaging conversations at hand.  Keep trying though.  You&#39;ve got to work hard.  Get all your facts down.  And be able to lay them down clearly and concisely, if you want to sway public opinion. I can tell you with certainty that playing the pathetic &#39;woe is me&#39; victim card will NOT work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have grown tired of the derailments. In the past I have tried keeping it up with the waste of time and eventually got exausted and end up with insults and degrading replies as a child, even to this day I repeat this in my weakest moments. I decided to leave the sub until the infestation was reduced. I return and it starts growing again constantly so I have decided to refuse arguing with r/conspiratard members all at once but I haven&#39;t done the same for debunkers, for now.</p>

<p>Here you can have the best example possible as to how much those people are despicable to the point of going back on their own word just to shit on the person&#39;s face.</p>

<p>Au_Is_Heavy makes the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/20otmi/example_of_other_tall_sky_scrapers_which_burned/cg5iezj">logic fallacy of using lack of imagination as means of rebutal</a>, asks that I <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/20otmi/example_of_other_tall_sky_scrapers_which_burned/cg5imob">explain it better to him</a> in which I <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/20otmi/example_of_other_tall_sky_scrapers_which_burned/cg5inuh">request that I will only waste the time with it if he accepts the fact that fires could not have done what happened to WTC7</a> and he proceeds with deception which I notice right away and demand that he writes his own words with no tricks, he still ignores it one more time before <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/20otmi/example_of_other_tall_sky_scrapers_which_burned/cg5it6k">writing the statement in quotes</a>, I ask him to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/20otmi/example_of_other_tall_sky_scrapers_which_burned/cg5iu0i">lose the quotation marks and warn him for the last time</a>, he finally does it as I asked. I then write what I said I would and after I write it, he <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/20otmi/example_of_other_tall_sky_scrapers_which_burned/cg5iubs">changes his reply and adds a ? at the end of the sentence so that he could say he never admitted it</a>. Forgets that I had the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/20otmi/example_of_other_tall_sky_scrapers_which_burned/cg5j05i">comment quoted without the question mark</a>.</p>

<p>Despite all of his disgusting dishonesty and attempt at not admitting in the end, he still went back on his word 2 times:  &quot;<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/20otmi/example_of_other_tall_sky_scrapers_which_burned/cg5it6k">Alright</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/20otmi/example_of_other_tall_sky_scrapers_which_burned/cg5iomu">Done</a>&quot; </p>

<p>This is the best example of how disgusting Debunkers can be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You chewed him out because he didn&#39;t exactly agree with your position that &quot;Fires could not have caused obliteration of those buildings, only demolition can, period.&quot; for which you provided not one tiny bit of evidence. </p>

<p>The problem with &quot;truthers&quot; is that there is no known explosives that could have been smuggled into the buildings for a controlled detonation because it would require MANY TONS of explosives. You just can&#39;t hide that. This means that either everyone in all the buildings was in on it (ridiculous), a previously unknown explosive that&#39;s vastly more powerful than anything known (speculative), or science fiction nonsense like earthquake machines (stupid). </p>

<p>&quot;False flag&quot; is at least worth discussion because that&#39;s about what&#39;s going on inside the minds of the hijackers, and it&#39;s vastly more likely that investigators didn&#39;t know exactly what was in their heads. There was significant speculation about their identity as well. &quot;The Israelis were behind 9/11&quot; strikes me as more plausible than earthquake machines. </p>

<p>I also wonder why there is more speculation about 9/11, which was on video, as opposed to the completely unsolved anthrax attacks that followed 9/11 and led to mass hysteria and the Patriot Act. Given that the anthrax was apparently traced to the US military, this at least appeared to be a &quot;false flag&quot; operation of some kind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I, as well as you, are fully capible of researching the obviously staged event.  You, for some foolish reason, can only stand to prop up the fictional government issued cospiracy theory (shill like behavior?).  All thr while, claiming this &quot;highly complex&quot; collapse cannot be understood by simple investigation and research.  A degree now is required, in your mind.  Those who wish to know the truth are easily able to find it.  It requires work.  It does not require a masters degree in engineering.</p>

<p>I highly suggest you do the smart thing, and look to the words of the lead architect of tye complex.  Look into the protections that were over-engineered and built into the skyscrapers.</p>

<p>When you have completed this, try to find one other time in history where a building collapse leaves pulverized dust.  One where the entire building comes down.  As though ALL key support structures were removed at the EXACT same time.  Frankly, either perfect &quot;collapse&quot; is not possible without the removal of ALL supports.  With some deep investigation, you will find that the inner core, which was not affected by the impacts of the planes, was able to keep both towers standing by itself.</p>

<p>Another huge piece is dealing with the kerosine accelerant.  Of which, 95%.burned up in the massive fireball of impact.  Not leaving enough fuel to cook the steel to temperatures hot enough to partially weaken the steel.</p>

<p>Yes it would. I don&#39;t know a lot about demolition, but I&#39;ve talked to several demo and pyro people about this and they said many tons. It would take several 18-wheelers just to transport the explosives. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>A single person could do it all given enough time. Could 20 men do it all in less than 12 hours (ignoring that people worked in the WTC at night)? No, not based on the volume of explosives. </p>

<p>And this would be impossible to hide. I don&#39;t know how the workers were supposed to miss tons of ampho or plastic explosive and wires strung everywhere. Again, those same demo people told me this would be completely impossible to conceal. </p>

<p>If the WTC was mined with explosives, the thousands of people inside the buildings absolutely <strong>HAD</strong> to know about it and willingly sacrificed their lives. And the survivors, first responders, many New Yorkers that worked nearby, etc. have all conspired together (10,000+ people) to keep the secret for 14 years. </p>

<p>The problem isn&#39;t the time needed to install the explosives, but the fact that they are impossible to conceal. One person in the building for a few minutes would likely detect the explosives, let alone thousands of workers. </p>

<p>Just as an example of how biased he is, in his next reply he continues insisting that explosives are impossible to conceal and that one person in the building for 30 seconds would detect the explosives.</p>

<p>This is not the mind of a person interested in having reasonable discussions, this is the mind like a child that has his ears covered and spits the nonsense fantasies that he believes to be possible without a shred of common sense. It&#39;s borderline pathetic.</p>

<p>The problem with &quot;truthers&quot; is that there is no known explosives that could have been smuggled into the buildings for a controlled detonation because it would require MANY TONS of explosives. You just can&#39;t hide that. This means that either everyone in all the buildings was in on it (ridiculous), a previously unknown explosive that&#39;s vastly more powerful than anything known (speculative), or science fiction nonsense like earthquake machines (stupid). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You start your attack using the same logic fallacy the user I mentioned before used. Your biased imagination is not evidence for rebutal, it is just a biased imagination.</p>

<p>If that logic had any merit then you wouldn&#39;t even dare to disagree with us when we said years ago that it is impossible for any tall building to globally collapse due to office fires and it is also impossible for it to achieve free-fall speeds, especially since we have the entire history of mankind proving this. But after 13 years we know pretty well how much you guys have no problem in believing in impossible scenarios being possible so why do you keep using that logic to refute our arguments is beyond my comprehension.</p>

<p>All of this still doesn&#39;t gives him the right to be a liar and try to weasel out of what he agreed to do by trying to deceive me with empty vague words. One of the few things that show how despicable a person is is to go back in his own word multiple times just so he won&#39;t agree with someone through deception and cheating.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;False flag&quot; is at least worth discussion because that&#39;s about what&#39;s going on inside the minds of the hijackers, and it&#39;s vastly more likely that investigators didn&#39;t know exactly what was in their heads. There was significant speculation about their identity as well. &quot;The Israelis were behind 9/11&quot; strikes me as more plausible than earthquake machines. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that the majority of the US still to this day thinks the war against Afghanistan was because the 9/11 terrorists were from Afghanistan while in fact none of the terrorists where from there and instead most from Saudi Arabia strongly suggests the US intentions of pushing to a war by any means necessary. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I also wonder why there is more speculation about 9/11, which was on video, as opposed to the completely unsolved anthrax attacks that followed 9/11 and led to mass hysteria and the Patriot Act. Given that the anthrax was apparently traced to the US military, this at least appeared to be a &quot;false flag&quot; operation of some kind. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because 9/11 was the start of everything, once you take that one down all of the rest crumbles. The Iraq 100 000 deaths was all based on a lie, publicly admitted lie about them having nukes and the public turned a blind eye to this horrendous bloodshed caused by their military war thirst. If something has horrendus as that was exposed and still almost no one cares about it, trying to do the same to the rest would meet the same result. This is why the 9/11 is the most focused, at least IMO.</p>

<p>If you have a genuine interest in this discussion I suggest that you read more about it <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/did-9-11-justify-the-war-in-afghanistan/19891">here</a>.</p>

<p>That is <strong>NOT</strong> evidence that the WTC was secretly mined with explosives or destroyed with an earthquake machine. This is the claim (that truthers refuse to state explicitly) that I&#39;m responding to. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to hold you to the phrase &quot;conventional explosives&quot;. That means you have ruled out earthquake machines and magical explosives. </p>

<p>This means that many tons of explosives were required to take down these buildings. </p>

<p>How did the explosives get into the buildings? Were the planes filled with explosives? Even if they were, that doesn&#39;t explain the &quot;truther&quot; claim what WTC7 was a &quot;controlled detonation&quot;. </p>

<p>This means that tons of explosives must have been inside WTC7. How were these explosives secretly moved into the buildings?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my point, which has been repeated several times:</p>

<p>&quot;Truthers&quot; like to hint or &quot;sort of&quot; claim that the WTC buildings were secretly mined with explosives or destroyed with earthquake machines. This is ridiculous and the &quot;truthers&quot; know it is, so they back away from the claim the moment this pointed out and instead they&#39;re &quot;just asking questions&quot;. </p>

<p>Thermite/thermate particles found in the dust, to this day no one has even tested the debris of actual collapses and building fires to show that the same particles were common.</p>

<p>The NIST report has been corrected multiple times because of the independent researchers that the debunkers often label as &quot;<em>crazy lunatics</em>&quot;, for example:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXTlaqXsm4k">David Chandler&#39;s free-fall correction on the NIST report.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyRjm6JeHDU">Ae911truth&#39;s missing and wrong structure values correction on the NIST report.</a></p>

<p>And even after all of this they still refuse to ammend the other serious mistakes that were pointed out clearly by the independent researchers, for example:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/news-section/41-articles/761-fraud-exposed-in-nist-wtc-7-reports-part-1.html">The available evidence shows that the fire responsible for the collapse initiation was already extinct long before and as such NIST did not have anything that could justify the fire they used for their simulation.</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>This is all just one fraction of the immense problems with the official version. It&#39;s not that we haven&#39;t produced an iota of evidence, it&#39;s that you guys refuse to see that we produced far more than NIST ever did to backup their impossible claims.</p>

<p>Now since it never happened before and you cannot prove it to be false, my dumb logic is as valid as yours and we get stuck at personal interpertations of the same event using assumptions over assumptions while ignoring the history as an important indicator of such things being impossible.</p>

Why do you feel the need to mention these can only be justified as means to strengthen your argument by using unnecessary extremes as means to ridicule my side, unless I am wrong and you will admit to have been incorrect in doing so.</p>

<p>Also, you mention &quot;<em>absolutely no evidence whatsoever is neither logical or reasonable</em>&quot;. Thank you, this is what truthers have been saying about the NIST report for years since they also made multiple impossible claims without absolutely no evidence whatsoever. Sadly you debunkers only see this argument fit for when it is convenient for you because when we use it then it becomes meaningless. Like practically every debunker does.</p>

<p>I did not, I directly linked and explained evidence that proved the presence of a material known and already proven to cut steel beams. If you are set to ignore what I present then this discussion is over.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since you outright refuse to present anything, I&#39;m going to simply declare that your theory is that explosives were secretly installed in the buildings. <strong>This is logistically impossible.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, logic fallacy resulting of a biased imagination and even accuse me of not presenting anything. It&#39;s not impossible to rig a building under the cover of a maintenance and/or floor upgrade team. What it is impossible is to violate the laws of physics and having 3 tall steel-framed buildings suffer total collapse for the first *<em>and only</em> time in the entire history of mankind, one simply because of small office fires and at free-fall speeds.</p>

<p>Biased lack of imagination is not a rebutal argument, it is simply evidence of a person set to not listen to anything at all costs and waste the time of others: aka debunkers.</p>

<p>This conversation proved to be another waste of time with a debunker which consistently ignored the evidence and facts brought forth, twisted his own words to fit his claims and tried to pursuit strawman arguments multiple times. For these reasons and for you not even correct your unwarranted ridicule tone as I asked before multiple times, this conversation is over.</p>

<p>EDIT: To prove even more how useless it is to have a discussion with you, you are the kind of person that states with clear conscience that it is impossible to conceal explosives and that a anyone inside the building for 30 seconds would detect the explosives when in fact <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_World_Trade_Center_bombing">there has been already a bomb concealed in WTC that no one detected until it exploded</a>, let alone in 30s. And your own words copied and linked here before you try to change them:</p>

<p>Yet thousands of people died.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As well, both had very large periods or power down in the days leading up to the staged event.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The problem isn&#39;t the time needed to install the explosives, but the fact that they are impossible to conceal. One person in the building for 30 seconds would detect the explosives.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>An absolutely pathetic attempt by rtechie1.  You&#39;re wasting your time arguing with fools.  A true waste of time.  As with the other disinformer you were speaking with, this guy is behaving exactly the same.  &quot;<em>They couldn&#39;t have carried in all of the explosives.  It souls have been 10 million pounds.of TNT.  No one can carry that much.  Someone would have talked.  They are incompetent, and couldn&#39;t have pulled this off.  Do not blame evil people for their malice, when you can incorrectly label it as an accident or error.  They are evil everywhere else in life, but they wouldn&#39;t be this evil.&quot;</em>  I can hear his sniveling high pitched voice say this word for word.  With all of it being 100% incorrect.</p>

<p>I still laugh at how these bafoons are still attempting to use the truther term as derogatory, when there is nothing more noble than seeking and compiling facts and truth.  The adversaries of truth are fighting an uphill battle, and they are losing.  They want us to believe they are stronger than they really are.  They want us to think that our beliefs are fringe, when in fact we are the majority now.  Truth is waking up countless people.</p>

<p>It would he nice if these fools actually tried.  They can&#39;t debate FACT, so they do stupid shit like this to get a rise or distract from the damaging (to them) conversations that we have here.  The truth apparently is quite damaging to their position.</p>

<p>Also, they could try a little harder to make the vote manipulation even just slightly less obvious.  When you see an abnormally low vote count on non insult posts, you can be relatively sure of its accuracy.  So much effort in an attempt to silence the open discussion of truth.  The topics they attack with ferocity is quite telling.</p>

<p>Also one think i think we need to realize is that their down-vote bots and what not are probably no where near as strong and plentiful as they could be, and i think this is intentional. If they were to use their full capabilities on down-voting i think it would be insanely obvious. So instead i suspect that they have been using a lot more of their resources in up-voting certain comments and submissions. It would be far less suspicious and most people would hardly notice.</p>

<p>I prove to him that this is not true:</p>

<p>Nope. The evidence (such as the collapse of the penthouse into the building) clearly shows that the core of the building began its collapse long before the outer shell. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I write an assumption in which I clearly state it and ask that people don&#39;t throw questionaires over my opinion, khamul787 completely ignores my request while calling me an ass and starts his questionaire anyway, gets angry because I point out his lack of respect towards my request.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You posted it on a public forum designed for conversation. I have no obligation to support your request. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I provide clear and direct evidence as to why NIST produced a fraudulent research, he shifts the subject, makes false claims about the times being discussed, does not correct his mistake and continues on a rampant of ignoring the evidence and clear material explaining the first statement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s funny. I corrected my mistake <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2162s1/wtc_7_freefall_admitted_by_nist_is_direct/cgah916">here</a>, and then provided proof immediately after. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eventually derails the entire discussion by arguments of denial and eventually degrades and declares the importance of what was being discussed in the first place to be meaningless:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was, because (and I stated this) it proves nothing. Freefall was already factored in to the building&#39;s collapse, and there is no evidence of a demolition. Proving it was marginally longer is irrelevant to the situation as a whole. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I request for evidence of his claims regarding the temperatures reached in the north tower, he links a statement where it mentions the claim of NIST&#39;s pockets of fire. Proceeds with demanding evidence for my claim when he clearly did not provide any for his in which I explain that he does not have the right to demand anything from me if he cannot provide evidence for his claims.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I said this like a dozen times. I shall emphasize here again, because you do not understand <strong>you still have to provide evidence whether I do or not.</strong> And AGAIN, you yourself admitted this was a troll thread that was factually incorrect at its very base. But no, you don&#39;t have to provide evidence for your OP, that would be ridiculous.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In which I reserve the right to end the discussion and khamul787 decides to consider in his mind to be another conceded argument in which he &quot;scores&quot; 5-0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was the 5th time you ran away from an argument. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I use him as example of strawmen argumentation, he proceeds with attacking with personal imagined scenarios in which I run from his discussions because I am &quot;losing&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you fail to address points put forward in argument, and then surrender in a childish fit, I would certainly consider it losing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. It <strong>is</strong> annoying however to go into a topic and have the posts be off-topic complaining. We should have a better system for dealing with that and keeping content on topic while resolving any issues. Like a Meta subreddit could do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps the reason why it keeps coming up is because no action is taken against it by Reddit. Imagine I came into a sub-reddit you use every single day and disrupted your discussion and called you an asshole and a lunatic constantly. It goes beyond trolling and it&#39;s a constant that has been done before even Reddit was around by the same people. People will come out of the wood work and play it down as trolling and make my post look paranoid but it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s been a long campaign of censorship that effected Digg to the point of nearly shutting down. Their admins removed the people that came here and setup conspiritard, why have Reddit not done the same?</p>

<p>Censoring people and trying to bury posts is not trolling, it&#39;s censorship. People on Reddit just don&#39;t care enough to rectify problems like a large number of people every day that listen to bullshit, get fed bullshit and do nothing about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t need to apologise for anything you post. I tend to stick to things that some people would perceive to be more based on reality but that doesn&#39;t mean I scoff at the idea of U.F.O&#39;s and such but I can see why some people think those topics might be detrimental to how this sub-reddit looks. The idea that this is a free thinking ground where topics can openly be discussed without censorship from mods is going in the direction a lot of the world is not.</p>

<p>It&#39;s incredibly important to maintain the idea that people should be able to formulate theories and opinions, present facts and expose crimes and corruption without fear or ridicule. Those kind of tactics of manipulation and intimidation are the reason why so many crimes are left unanswered. </p>

<p>The setup here is probably one of the best set of rules I&#39;ve seen. No topic is censored, people either like it or don&#39;t and they up vote and down vote. Other sub reddits ban sites, submissions and even yesterday, Bipolarbear0 told people to refrain from speculating on the Fort Hood shooting in the post he/she created. The idea that you can&#39;t speculate or look for answers that aren&#39;t given to you by government mouthpieces is really disturbing to me. If that&#39;s all we had the ability to receive, we&#39;d be completely fucked.</p>

<p>And I think now is a good time for a suggestion I have for people that post here.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Take more time to consider the information before you post</p></li>
<li><p>Check out the information before you post it, not just the headline</p></li>
<li><p>Try and supply multiple sources for you post</p></li>
<li><p>Try and use source material if it applies</p></li>
<li><p>Try and accommodate skeptics by using sources they trust </p></li>
<li><p>Start reporting people that are not here for discussion to the mods and do your part </p></li>
</ul>

<p>All of these things would help this sub-reddit in a huge way. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not a fan of GM and Ford and their lock on the domestic auto industry. </p>

<p>But this is just crazy. Tesla is a tech media <em>darling</em>. They get enormous and constant positive press. Especially considering that they are a tiny boutique automaker like Ferrari. </p>

<p>Perhaps all that press means that they get some negative press too, but they negative press Tesla has gotten over QA problems is really nothing next to the negative attention GM has received over recent product recalls (which led to fatalities), for example. </p>

<p>If you think the incumbent automakers are blocking electric cars, that just isn&#39;t so. I&#39;ve driven electric cars. I like electric cars. But there remain serious logistical issues with batteries involving range and charging that have yet to be overcome. Lots of people are working on higher-density batteries, but it&#39;s a tougher problem than you may think. </p>

<p>My main concern is disingenuous moderators are admin on reddit intentionally thwarting our efforts here through shadowbans and outright censorship like what seems to be the case in the Bostonbombing and Sandyhook subreddits.  Autobots also concern me if anything with such and such a word or from a particular site is automatically set to get a downvote for every upvote or something of that nature.  But I don&#39;t have the skills to accurately identify that or combat it if I did.</p>

<p>I just remember when the front page of reddit used to be a place where I learned about people like Bill Hicks, Mitch Hedberg, and Nikola Tesla and where we collaborated and organized things such as the SOPA blackout and the Colbert/Stewart rally, which turned out to be a bust, but showed the power and potential of a social media user base that a site like Reddit has.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve brought that up a few times.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you my take. I enjoy discussing conspiracy. if someone has a wacky idea about bigfoot banging a space alien it doesn&#39;t offend me. It can be interesting and entertaining.</p>

<p>What&#39;s not of interest is a sub where the majority of posts are unimaginative trolls by juvenile tools. That&#39;s where we are at with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. As a result i need to keep myself entertained by examining the mental behavior that is overwhelmingly presented here. When you follow it along you end up on <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. And honestly, it&#39;s a really interesting thing that is happening. They are unknowingly trolling themselves by posting their own troll submissions on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. I find that interesting and I&#39;m likely going to follow it to it&#39;s tragic conclusion.. When it becomes so obvious that a larger reddit majority will become aware of it and it will become a meme, providing years of enjoyment.</p>

<p>This thread is part of the story. First the majority of sincere subscribers here need to become aware of the novel event unfolding. And as a result, the skeptards will have an opportunity to, since they make up 50% of the activity here.</p>

<p>Apparently SOME of the posts, comments and information are touching nerves - and is being taken seriously enough to warrant a concerted effort to SHUT YOU UP.</p>

<p>So, what are the topics being discussed in this sub that have attracted the attention of the Killer Bees?</p>

<p>Is it UFO&#39;s and aliens? Not likely. Is it the NSA debackle? Nah, that is being discussed broadly across many &quot;mainstream&quot; subs.</p>

<p>So what is it that is being said that they are willing to work so hard to censor via their &quot;downvote DOS attack&quot;?</p>

<p>To answer that, it may be productive to look at WHO is mounting the attack, and see if we can find common denominators among the members of that group: What are their commonalities? Which topics to they find the MOST irritating and &quot;offensive&quot;. What topics cause them to rant, rave and fling accusations on the &quot;moral character&quot; of the sub and its members?</p>

<p><strong>Whatever it is, we need to do MORE of it, not less.</strong></p>

<p>Our community is already dead all the core contributors have been wrongfully shadowbanned by the Admins of the site. Contrary to popular belief the Admins are NOT here to help us. We are not only under attack by the usual suspects but the Admins as well someone you cannot fight back against. Most of this site is dead as far as it being non controlled source of information and free discussion amongst like minded people, now its just a cesspool of shills, trolls, censorship by mods, and Admin removals/shadowbans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah man, this place is a shadow of what it used to be when I first came here.  The intellect has shot way down.  There used to be masterminds at work here, and there still are, but all the negative attention I think has rightfully spooked some people away.  When you start to look at FEMA camps and their coffin supplies, DHS buying up all the ammo, Sandy Hook shit coming after peoples guns, ad infinitum.  They&#39;re thumbing their nose at this place and simultaneously deploying so much propaganda and internet warfare.  I mean there is a whole cyber battle group in the us mil for christ&#39;s sake.  Imagine what they&#39;re trying to do to foreign nets.  And the fact is, folks in this sub prob aren&#39;t debating any of them, they&#39;re not here to converse.  They&#39;re here to down vote like crazy.  Hell, reddit is conde naste right.  Sure wouldn&#39;t be hard to blackmail the share holders to clamp down this place considering that much of the NSA data center bullshit is used for corporate espionage.  I mean, wall street is stealing at miliseconds.  The whole world is in on it.  What purpose does this sub serve to money?  Nothing.  It hinders these greedy enterprises.  Wouldn&#39;t want that in a country whose economy is based on buying consumer goods aka cheap, needless garbage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a five year account and after about 3 months of coming to this sub it was shadowbanned. I could not believe it. They said it was for participating in a vote brigade from conspiracy.</p>

<p>Makes you wonder how a sub like <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a> can exist. Isn&#39;t that entire sub a giant vote brigade? I didn&#39;t even know vote brigading was a thing until I came here. I used to do it all the time because I thought it was normal. I&#39;d find a link to an interesting thread and then go there and vote as I&#39;d normally do. </p>

<p>Then all of a sudden I do that with a thread from conspiracy and I&#39;m shadowbanned. A 5 year account gone without even a warning. Disgusting.</p>

<p>This thread says it all. 54 up, 54 down. </p>

<p>50% of the activity on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is from skeptards. They are so lost in their troll attempts they are inadvertently linking fellow skeptard trolls from here to <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. </p>

<p>They are pointing and laughing at their own BAD troll attempts under the delusion that they are real posts. Honestly, it&#39;s one of the funniest, most bizarre things I&#39;ve personally witnessed on reddit or any other forum/discussion community.. And I&#39;ve been doing this since the days of fidoNet. </p>

<p>It WILL implode. Soon, associating yourself to <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> will be like openly announcing you love eating shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The price of a pickle.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how I go about things. I (usually) either vote or comment, one or the other.</p>

<p>If I vote, my vote means: I think this topic is interesting, needs to be discussed, or is something I&#39;m curious about and would like to read others&#39; opinions on it.</p>

<p>If I comment, my comment stands on its own merit.</p>

<p>This works very well with reddit&#39;s processing for the hot (front page) list.</p>

<p>For a post to be in &quot;hot&quot;, the reddit processing considers <em>both</em> the voting and the commenting. This is how you can see something in the &quot;hot default 25 list&quot; that only has a few votes, but also has several comments. I&#39;ve seen posts with as few as 20 total votes (e.g., 15/-5) but also had 10 or more comments... as high as number 5 on the hot front page.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I fear to upvote, as i could be bumping a dis-information post</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is where the comments mitigate. I&#39;ve upvoted posts I thought were potentially disinfo, because I saw comments underneath discussing that fact - thus, my vote was for people to see the discussion about the disinfo, not necessarily to believe the posted link.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be afraid. Participate. If you want to see something discussed, but don&#39;t have something to immediately offer, upvote... get others&#39; input... come back later and learn from it. If you comment, great; especially if it&#39;s a productive comment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always check the new section and give an upvote to something that deserves attention. I suppose they can&#39;t stop everyone because some quality posts always make it to the main page. It doesn&#39;t make any sense to me the people who come here and because they genuinely dislike the community downvote things. Shills will be shills, but its a shame that some cant consider the fact that people want to talk about a subject(s) that make them uncomfortable.</p>

That&#39;s ok though - it&#39;s like the thunderdome. Say what you have to say and move on. I see a lot of what the mods say and do here as the same as the govt. if they really wanted things to improve for the better they would make changes to accommodate this being a better place. Instead they make rules like rule #10 that have only made it worse. You don&#39;t want downvote brigades? Disable the voting. This place has taken a slide and is most likely on its way out but shit happens and things change and we may hopefully find some other place for a while but don&#39;t start with the sentimental &quot;community&quot; bullshit.

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t make a new one.  I&#39;m critical of some conspiracy theories and I get downvoted into oblivion for it.  Yes I have commented on conspiritard too, but I do believe there are conspiracies in abundance.  Just the popular ones grate with me,  especially when there is quite good evidence against a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Just watch how I get comments removed from askreddit - I&#39;m about to post a quite good question, but it&#39;ll be pulled.  </p>

<p>The Question I&#39;m about to pose is &#39;If I book a holiday in Egypt and there&#39;s a public stoning of a 12 year old prostitute taking place, will I face prosecution in the US or Europe if I join in and bounce some rocks on her skull?&#39;.  </p>

<p>The answer is a resounding NO!  I already know that I wouldn&#39;t, just as I wouldn&#39;t face prosecution if I travel to Syria, join the rebel forces for two weeks, rape a few Christian children and then murder their entire family and eat their hearts on a live streaming webcam.</p>

<p>Why is nobody addressing these issues?  The laws make no sense - if you travel to Cambodia and have sex with an under age prostitute you will face prosecution in both the US or EU - so you can&#39;t have sex for money with one, but you can murder an underage prostitute in another part of the world, and you can rape one if you&#39;re a member of an approved rebel force?  </p>

<p>This is a conspiracy!  This is going on right now and thousands of people are exploiting it! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi guys, just made this here account, pretty much solely for the purpose of this sub and for participating in the discussions herein.</p>

<p>I had a couple of hours to read and scan through all the various posts before I created this account, and then I saw this stickied post, so I thought I&#39;d leave some input.</p>

<p>My biggest problem with a lot of what gets posted here is the same problem most news sites have, and that is sensationalised post headings.</p>

<p>Guys (the guys guys, not the people that are here only to rot this sub from within, and to them I recommend fucking a landmine), please try to be unbiased in the way you present information. Information is a thing which gets put through the prism of the mind that&#39;s interpreting it anyway, there is no need to attach bias to a piece of information before people have a chance to find out what the subject at hand actually is.</p>

<p>As far as the downvoting problem this sub seems to be experiencing, all I can say is this: persevere. If you see misinformation or something equally suspect, report it. If you see something as a relevant piece of information that <em>should</em> be seen, upvote it regardless of your personal feeling towards the subject matter. The thing about a place like this is that everyone is here for a reason. And while it may not be for the same <em>specific</em> reason you are here, these things we share in common with each other are beyond the scope of our personal prejudice. We are all in this together, so let&#39;s act like it.</p>

<p>Finally, I would just like to thank everyone involved in this sub and everyone involved in the spreading of information that is relevant to our survival as a species. It saddens me more and more each day to see my fellow man completely enslaved by their own kind, be it through financially crippling mortgage payments or through the thick layer of blubber that is reality TV. We all <em>exist</em> on the same planet, but unfortunately we are not all <em>on</em> the same planet, if you follow.</p>

<p>And these people, they don&#39;t know any better. They only have what they have been able to absorb from their environment, coupled with their own curiosity and fearlessness, however limited it may be. And the thing is, none of us started out the way we are now. We all share a similar past of an uninformed existence. But we are here now and that is what matters.</p>

<p>So thank you, each and every one of you, for this. For each monolithic oak that has stood the test of time came from a tiny seed, unaware of its own significance at the time of being said seed. We are the seed. Let&#39;s get to work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check out the reddit FAQ, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq">this</a> part in particular.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How is a submission&#39;s score determined?</p>

<p>A submission&#39;s score is simply the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes. If five users like the submission and three users don&#39;t it will have a score of 2. Please note that the vote numbers are not &quot;real&quot; numbers, they have been &quot;fuzzed&quot; to prevent spam bots etc. So taking the above example, if five users upvoted the submission, and three users downvote it, the upvote/downvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes, or 12 upvotes, and 10 downvotes. The points score is correct, but the vote totals are &quot;fuzzed&quot;.</p>

Similar to Tesla in <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a>.  Stuff doesn&#39;t get deleted so much here, and what does is logged in <a href="/r/uncensorship">/r/uncensorship</a>.  So you get more noise here, but also a lot more transparency.  Which is more like the real world.</p>

<p>For example, the bot&#39;s comment states a timestamp score of 64|20 - 44 karma for this thread 5 hours ago.  </p>

<p>This thread is now at 225|92 - 133 karma.</p>

<p>So since being posted to <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>, this thread has <em>gained</em> karma, thus disproving any allegations of a brigade. </p>

<p>The problem isn&#39;t the time needed to install the explosives, but the fact that they are impossible to conceal. One person in the building for a few minutes would likely detect the explosives, let alone thousands of workers. </p>

<p>Just as an example of how biased he is, in his next reply he continues insisting that explosives are impossible to conceal and that one person in the building for 30 seconds would detect the explosives.</p>

<p>This is not the mind of a person interested in having reasonable discussions, this is the mind like a child that has his ears covered and spits the nonsense fantasies that he believes to be possible without a shred of common sense. It&#39;s borderline pathetic.</p>
