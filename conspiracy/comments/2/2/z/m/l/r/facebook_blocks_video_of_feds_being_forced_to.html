<p>Here is the video you WILL NOT SEE on the mainstream media. </p>

<p>The BLM did NOT simply &quot;leave&quot; and return the Bundy cattle. They were going to KEEP the cattle --- until a group of brave patriots and cowboys from 7 Western states stood up to sniper guns and FORCED the release themselves.</p>

<p>Sooo copy the link below and paste it into your browser but take out the space between the &quot;/&quot; and &quot;watch&quot; and watch the video of the citizens who forced the release of cattle at Bundy Ranch. This is a crazy time in our history and for some reason Facebook is censoring it. Seriously-- try to post the link and Facebook says it can&#39;t do it because their security systems have detected it as &quot;unsafe&quot;… Riiight…  (Also, I feel the need to mention that nobody told me to do this/say/this/pass it on and I refuse to play into stupid chain mail type shtuff but I encourage you to pass this to your friends as well!) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">https://www.youtube.com/</a> watch?v=a_XqdQjTflc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I can tell, Bundy owns the ranch and owes the government a lot of money because his cattle grazed at an endangered tortoise habitat. People representing the government have been going to his ranch and taking his cattle as their payment, as he hasn&#39;t been paying the fine.</p>

<p>So he goes and contacts the local news and claims the officers retrieving his cattle are armed like military soldiers, and they have surrounded their ranch. </p>

<p>Bundy claims this whole thing is about a land grab for oil or solar powering. Luckily Nevada&#39;s governor sides with Bundy and said this is a perfect opportunity for activists to come forward. They came forward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was renting federal land for cattle, the feds restricted his use once they determined an endangered species was at risk. He ignored them. The federal government then declined to renew his lease of the federally owned land he had been using, at which point he claimed since he&#39;d been using it forever he could still use it. Feds took him to court twice, winning both times, rancher still refuses to comply or pay any fines. Court then okays the gov&#39;t to forcibly remove the cattle on their land, shitstorm ensues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the court case, detailing how the land is federally owned, and in no way owned by Mr. Bundy. In addition it is proof of the ruling that Cliven Bundy has been illegally allowing his cattle to graze on land he doesn&#39;t own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the tortoise habitat was an excuse though.  Not sure if mentioned in the video or another one, but Harry Reid&#39;s son is in control of the land or has to do with the area or something like that.  And I think he&#39;s in works to loan or sell the land to the Chinese for some solar power type of infrastructuring .</p>

<p>here&#39;s the story, &quot;The Nevada rancher who forced the federal Bureau of Land Management to back down last week may have been targeted because a Chinese solar company with ties to Sen. Harry Reid&#39;s son wants the land for an energy plant, several websites report.&quot;  Rory Reid is the son.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s more of a parsing issue or it&#39;s a fabricated &quot;censoring.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based off the fact a little research on Facebook&#39;s spam policy, I&#39;m sure someone has mass messaged this video on Facebook and Facebook&#39;s automated systems have flagged it as spam. </p>

<p>Take it with a grain of salt, but it&#39;s likely someone posted it to a whole lot of people at once and some people flagged it as spam. Or someone send a mass message out to their list and said, &quot;OMG you have to see this video!&quot;</p>

<p>Why would four people with four different computers in four different locations not see it blocked? Maybe Facebook unblocked the video as spam? They do have the ability to unblock spammy links. </p>
