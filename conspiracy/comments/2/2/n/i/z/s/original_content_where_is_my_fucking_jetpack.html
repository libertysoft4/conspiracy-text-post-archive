        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As told by history, after Tesla&#39;s death <a href="http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla">the FBI was contacted by the War Department (now know as the less ominous Department of Defense)</a>, his papers were declared to be top secret. If you read up on Patent Law, you may find some interesting information: The U.S. Patent Office has a nine-member committee that screens patents in order to protect &quot;national security&quot;. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/181">U.S. Code › Title 35 › Part II › Chapter 17 › § 181
35 U.S. Code § 181 - Secrecy of certain inventions and withholding of patent</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whenever publication or disclosure by the publication of an application or by the grant of a patent on an invention in which the Government has a property interest might, in the opinion of the head of the interested Government agency, be detrimental to the national security, the Commissioner of Patents upon being so notified shall order that the invention be kept secret and shall withhold the publication of the application or the grant of a patent therefor under the conditions set forth hereinafter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Tesla&#39;s claim about free energy and anti-gravity are true, the consequences to the world economy and world powers would change the world overnight.</p>

<p><em>These concepts have been proven in hundreds of laboratories all over the world, yet never see the light of day. If the new energy technologies were set free world wide the change would be profound. It would affect everybody, it would be applicable everywhere. These technologies are absolutely the most important thing that have happened in the history of the world.</em>   – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_O&#x27;Leary">Dr. Brian O’Leary</a>, Former NASA Astronaut and Princeton Physics</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My flying machine will have neither wings nor propellers. You might see it on the ground and you would never guess that it was a flying machine. Yet it will be able to move at will through the air in any direction with perfect safety, at higher speeds than have yet been reached, regardless of weather and oblivious of &quot;holes in the air&quot; or downward currents. It will ascend in such currents if desired. It can remain absolutely stationary in the air, even in a wind, for great length of time. Its lifting power will not depend upon any such delicate devices as the bird has to employ, but upon positive mechanical action.&quot; - Nikola Tesla in New York Herald Tribune, Oct. 15, 1911</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you had a flying machine powered by an infinite energy source, it would render international borders useless. No more &quot;no-fly&quot; lists, TSA, groping... basicaly all forms of government control of the masses would collapse. Some of the companies that would take a hit:</p>

<ul>
<li>J P Morgan (banking, energy, railroads, US Steel)</li>
<li>Edison &amp; General Electric (oil &amp; energy, railroads, aviation, war industrials, banking)</li>
<li>Rockefellers (oil, banking, Nazi connections through IG Farben)</li>
<li>Rothschilds (banking, oil &amp; natural resources, connections to Kuhn Loeb &amp; company through Jacob Schiff )</li>
<li>Ford motors (motors, war industrials)</li>
<li>Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co (banking, ship yards, railroads, IG Farben)</li>
<li>Du Ponts (chemicals &amp; war industrials, General Motors, IG Farben)</li>
<li>Vanderbilts (railroads, ship yards)</li>
<li>Boeing Company (aviation)</li>
<li>Lockheed (aviation)</li>
</ul>

<p>Oil &amp; energy, steel and other natural resources, railroads, ship yards, aviation, car industry, spare parts, logistics, banking &amp; finance, military industrial complex are some of the reasons to steal and keep this technology hidden.</p>

<p>But as the saying goes, follow the money.</p>

<p><strong>1870:</strong> John D. Rockefeller Founds Standard Oil</p>

<p>Rockefeller founds Standard Oil of Ohio with $1 million in capital, the largest corporation in the country. The new company controls 10% of U.S. petroleum refining.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/rockefellers/timeline/index.html">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/rockefellers/timeline/index.html</a></p>

<p><strong>September 1873</strong>: Stock Exchange Crashes and Standard Oil Takes Advantage of Economic Downturn</p>

<p>On September 18, the stock market crashed, followed by a six year depression. During this time, Standard Oil absorbs refineries in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New York, and Pennsylvania&#39;s Oil Region.</p>

<p><strong>1877:</strong> Rockefeller controls almost 90% of the oil refined in the United States</p>

<p><strong>1882:</strong> Standard Oil Trust is Formed</p>

<p><strong>1890:</strong> Congress Passes Sherman Antitrust Act</p>

<p>This is the first Federal statute to limit cartels and monopolies.</p>

<p><strong>1892:</strong> JP Morgan Arranges Merger of Edison General Electric and Thomson-Houston Electric Company to Form General Electric (GE)</p>

<p><strong>1896:</strong> Henry Ford Assembles First Automobile, Demand for Oil Increases</p>

<p><strong>1901:</strong> J.P. Morgan Founds U.S. Steel, the First Billion-Dollar Corporation</p>

<p>U.S. Steel is still one of the worlds largest steel producers.</p>

<p><strong>1902:</strong> Nikola Tesla Begins Exploring How to Transmit Electricity Without Power Lines; JP Morgan Refuses Further Funding
Nikola Tesla’s Wardenclyffe Tower, initially financed by J.P. Morgan, was designed to transmit electricity without wires. By 1904, J.P. Morgan - who had a monopoly on copper which was used to transmit electricity – refused to provide any more funding.</p>

<p><strong>1908:</strong> The U.S. Government Targets Standard Oil in Antitrust Suit</p>

<p><strong>1911:</strong> The U.S. Supreme Court Orders Standard Oil to Dissolve. Shootoffs Include ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, and ConocoPhillips.</p>

<p>Standard Oil is split up into 34 different companies. The Rockefellers still hold stock in these oil companies.</p>

<p><strong>1913:</strong> Rockefeller Foundation is Founded. John D. Rockefeller gives the Foundation $100 million in First Year.</p>

<p><strong>1919:</strong> American Petroleum Institute (API) is Established</p>

<p>API represents the oil and natural gas industry. Today API Represents More than 400 corporate members including Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, GE, Halliburton, and Shell.</p>

<p><strong>1969:</strong> API Moves its Headquarters to Washington DC</p>

<p>By 2011 it represents more than 400 corporate members. In 2010, it spent more than $7 million on lobbying.</p>

<p><strong>1982:</strong> Inventors Adam Trombly and Joseph Kahn receive an <a href="http://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/WO1982002126">international patent</a> for a zero-point energy device</p>

<p>They called it the &quot;Closed Path Homopolar Machine&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>1983:</strong> Trombly was issued a gag order by the U.S. government to stop development of the &quot;Closed Path Homopolar Machine&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Mid 1980&#39;s:</strong> Trombly developed another zero-point energy device with David Farnsworth
This device was called the “Piezo Ringing Resonance Generator.”</p>

<p><strong>January, 1989:</strong> Former Oil Businessman, George H. W. Bush, Becomes President</p>

<p>Before becoming President of the United States, Bush made a fortune in the oil industry. He founded Zapata Oil Corporation and ran the offshore drilling company for years.</p>

<p><strong>June 1989:</strong> Trombly’s Free Energy Demonstrations in New York and Washington D.C. Suppressed
Inventor Adam Trombly was scheduled to demonstrate a small version of his Piezo Ringing Resonance Generator at the UN in New York.  At the last minute Trombly was forced to do his demonstration at a church down the street.  Afterwards Trombly gave a speech in Dag Hammarskjöld Auditorium at the United Nations in front of an international audience. A few days later, Trombly was scheduled to demonstrate the same device at the US Senate Banking and Finance Committee in Washington. Only Senator Carl Levin and a &quot;handful&quot; of staff were in attendance because the Senior Bush Administration called hundreds of Senators, Congressional Representatives and their staff members for an &quot;off-the-cuff&quot; discussion of the Clean Air Act at the exact same time as Trombly’s demonstration.  The oil administration successfully diverted attention away from the technology in an effort to censor Trombly. Subsequently his lab was raided by the FBI, millions of dollars of equipment was taken and he was threatened and required &quot;for reasons of national security&quot; to cease his research.</p>

<p><strong>1989:</strong> MIT &amp; Harvard Grad, Eugene Mallove, Authors the Book, Fire From Ice, Which Details the Success of a Cold-Fusion Device with &quot;Greater than Unity&quot; Output</p>

<p><strong>1994:</strong> Infinite Energy Magazine – “The Magazine of New Energy Science and Technology” – is Founded by Eugene Mallove
The magazine covers both the theoretical and technological developments in the &quot;new energy&quot; field.</p>

<p><strong>2004:</strong> Eugene Mallove is Mysteriously Murdered Outside Childhood Home</p>

<p><strong>1998-2011:</strong> Oil &amp; Gas Industry Spends $1,114,552,107 on Lobbying</p>

<p><strong>2006</strong> – A brief summary of the &quot;History of &#39;New Energy&#39;&quot; Invention Suppression Cases</p>

<p>Source: <a href="http://www.rense.com/general72/oinvent.htm">http://www.rense.com/general72/oinvent.htm</a></p>

<p>An elite group of people and the corporations they run, have gained control over not just our energy, food supply, education and health care, but over virtually every aspect of our lives. And they do it by controlling the world of finance, not by creating more value, but by actually controlling the source of money. When you follow the money, it will take you to up the levels of a pyramid. We are at the bottom level, going about our daily lives. Above us is government, people who are given a monopoly on force and use it to tax and control us, whether or not we agree. But who controlls them? At the next level are the corporations. Many would say that it is now corporations (a &quot;corporatocracy&quot;) and not nation states, that rule the world. To acquire the world&#39;s resources and control the markets, this corporatocracy must to have access to cheap money. The big corporations get their loans with special rates from big banks, which means that those who control the major banks, the money elite, ultimately control the corporations which in turn control goverments and finally the people.</p>

<p>Free energy exists and this is being kept secret. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t have my fucking jetpack. Yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it goes back even further. I have no doubt in my mind that these technologies were known by ancient civilizations and were used to create their monuments, the pyramids and more recently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_Castle">Coral Castle</a>.</p>

<p>Imagine a free energy generator at home. I could build an electrified perimeter and turrets armed with <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/u-navy-test-futuristic-super-fast-gun-sea-202608368--sector.html">rail guns</a>. No knock warrant? Fuck you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is probably true. People before recorded history were a lot more tuned to the frequencies of the universe, like animals that guide their navigation by means of Earth&#39;s magnetism, which is where this &quot;aether&quot; energy source supposedly comes from. In essense, our &quot;civilized&quot; society has devolved rather than evolved since this knowledge has been lost/hidden from the rest of society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s definitely been hidden rather than lost.  And I think a huge part of the reason why the people today aren&#39;t as &quot;in tune&quot; has to do not only with our shittier diets but also with the effect of background radiation from 70 years of nuclear energy/detonations/waste being let loose all over the world (among many other things, but those are probably two of the main ones).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So... why would &#39;rogue&#39; states other entities cooperate in preserving the status quo? Why did Nazi Germany play by the rules of American patents and corporations when they ran out of oil? Why is Iran futilely attempting to construct nuclear reactors? Why is China destroying their own soil with mining and fossil fuel pollution? Why is North Korea still in a virtual dark age?</p>

<p>The technology was known to &quot;hundreds of laboratories all over the world&quot;, but not a single one ever publicized let alone exploited it. Not even one impoverished African nation is willing to risk the ire of Ford Motors to instantly become the most powerful nation on the continent?</p>

<p>Again, <a href="http://www.rense.com/general72/oinvent.htm">read the post.</a></p>

<p>Few examples:  </p>

<p>Wayne Henthron - from Los Angeles built an &quot;Electrometric Auto&quot; in 1976 that managed to regenerate its own electricity. In normal stop and go driving it gave several hundred miles of service between recharges. The system worked by the wiring of the batteries to act as capacitors once the car was moving along with four standard auto alternators acting to keep the batteries charged. With little official interest in his system the inventor resolved to make the car available to the public to do so, is now involved with the World Federation of Science and Engineering - 15532 Computer Lane, Huntington Beach, CA, 92649. <a href="http://www.new-energypedia.com/dJxQY23nScqP2u9YAU38L2rgXXoxW6MmXhM35qN7N3RXXv8ny8/Information_neue_Energien.pdf">Source</a></p>

<p>Joseph R. Zubris - developed in 1969 an electric car circuit design (<a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US3809978">US PAT #3,809,978</a>) that he estimated cost him $100 a year to operate. Using an old ten horse electric truck motor, he worked out a unique system to get peak performance from his old 1961 Mercury engine that he ran from this power plant. The device actually cut energy drain on electric car starting by 75%, and by weakening excitation after getting started, produced a 100% mileage gain over conventional electric motors. The inventor was shocked to find the lack of reaction from larger business interests, and so in the early seventies began selling licenses to interested smaller concerns for $500. Last known address was Zubris Electrical Company, 1320 Dorchester Ave, Boston, Ma, 02122.</p>

<p>Richard Diggs - developed at an inventors workshop (I.W. international) his &quot;Liquid Electricity Engine&quot; that he believed could power a large truck for 25,000 miles from a single portable unit of his electrical fuel. Liquid electricity violated a number of the well known physical laws that the inventor pointed out. The inventor was also aware of the profound impact the invention could have upon the world&#39;s economy - if it could be developed.</p>

<p>B. Von Platen- (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltzar_von_Platen_(inventor)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltzar_von_Platen_(inventor)</a>) - a 65 year old Swedish inventor made a major breakthrough in the field of Thermo-electric engines with his &quot;Hot and Cold Engine&quot; - based on the fact that wires of different metals produce electricity if they are joined and heated, the inventors secret breakthrough is said to give more than 30% more efficiency than regular motors, and with a radioactive isotope for power (hmmm?!) it could be completely free from oil.
Volvo of Sweden bought the rights to this in 1975.</p>

<p>Besides inventions that could end energy monopolies, what has Tesla been wrong about in his experiments?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, that doesn&#39;t take away from the fact that there isn&#39;t a prototype of any sort that I can see (which is especially weird considering this is the era of the internet). Secondly some of the evidence he uses are not that great. For example Eugene Mallow, who&#39;s murder is usually attributed to a robbery, not intentional assassination. Stanley Meyer, who was actually sued for defrauding investors with his inventions, and for good reason. And a few others. So in short, I question wether there even <em>is</em> such orders, or if it&#39;s just people trying to get publicity for their &quot;inventions&quot; by claiming they are being actively suppressed (which is actually a pretty good way to get publicity mind you).</p>

<p>He was wrong about quite a bit actually. He was wrong about teleforce, he was wrong about his so called &quot;earthquake machine&quot;, and notably, he was wrong about his assumptions that electrons didn&#39;t exist among other things. He was in no way whatsoever, right about everything.</p>

<p>Firstly, how the hell would I prove something <em>isn&#39;t</em> an assassination. In fact, it should be up to the guy (or you, either one) to prove that it was, since it was brought up originally as an assassination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you <em>do</em> live in land of conjecture and opinion. Look kid, I know your thing is debunking stuff, but your flimsy arguments just don&#39;t hold any water. Tesla proved Edison wrong, so what makes you right?</p>

<p>In the era where information can easily be accessed/distributed via the internet, I&#39;d think someone would have posted such things for others to make prototypes of, and for someone to then have made a prototype of said device. That was what I was getting at with that point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, I&#39;m confused about one thing though. The homopolar machine patent which they had a gag order on is online and it seems ot be pretty descriptive.</p>

<p><a href="http://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO1982002126&amp;amp;recNum=1&amp;amp;maxRec=&amp;amp;office=&amp;amp;prevFilter=&amp;amp;sortOption=&amp;amp;queryString=&amp;amp;tab=PCT+Biblio">http://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO1982002126&amp;amp;recNum=1&amp;amp;maxRec=&amp;amp;office=&amp;amp;prevFilter=&amp;amp;sortOption=&amp;amp;queryString=&amp;amp;tab=PCT+Biblio</a></p>

<p>If there was a gag order why is all of this information available and why can&#39;t someone use the info in the patent to build the machine today?</p>

<p>C. Even still, it&#39;s technically not &quot;free&quot; energy. He&#39;s not claiming free energy, which is an efficiency greater than 1. He&#39;s simply claiming a cheap source of energy readily available.

<p>As for the claims that this power was “free energy” not just in its inability to be metered but also its generation, it seems that they stem from ignorance of how Tesla had designed the facility; the transmitter was to be powered by a 200 kilowatt Westinghouse alternating current generator driven by a Westinghouse auto compound engine. Some conspiracy theorists claim instead that it was to be powered by Tesla’s apparatus for the utilization of radiant energy,” but again, the conspiracy theorists fail to understand that “radiant energy” isn’t “energy all around us,” but rather, is defined as energy in the form of electromagnetic waves– in essence, what Tesla patented is no more a “free energy” device than a solar panel is.
In fact, in the patent, Tesla specifically mentioned that “The apparatus being arranged as shown, it will be found that when the radiations of the sun or of any other source capable of producing the effects before describe fall upon the plate P an accumulation of electrical energy in the condenser C will result.”  This isn’t nearly as mind-blowing as somehow tapping into the æther for an unlimited power source would be, but then again, isn’t it par for the course for conspiracy theorists to pretend reality isn’t interesting enough?</p>
