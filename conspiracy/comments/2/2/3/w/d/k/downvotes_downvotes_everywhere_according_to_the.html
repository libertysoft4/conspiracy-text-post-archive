    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about...I see evidence of this every day.</p>

<p>If I submit the <em>same</em> article to one of the major subs, it does <em>considerably</em> better than on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> in the first few minutes, even if the subject is overtly conspiratorial.</p>

<p>For example, after 13 minutes, here are the vote tallies in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for this story: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ft. Hood, PTSD, and the True Cost of US Wars of Choice</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> it&#39;s currently at <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/223wkh/ft_hood_ptsd_and_the_true_cost_of_us_wars_of/">4 upvotes and 2 downvotes</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, it&#39;s at <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/223wkn/ft_hood_ptsd_and_the_true_cost_of_us_wars_of/">7 upvotes to <em>8</em> downvotes</a>.</p>

<p>After 20 minutes for this story:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s Torture...But Let&#39;s Not Call It That: These kinds of tactics would be labeled as torture if they were happening in another country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> it&#39;s at <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/223vvw/its_torturebut_lets_not_call_it_that_these_kinds/">3 upvotes and 1 downvote</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> it&#39;s at <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/223vv5/its_torturebut_lets_not_call_it_that_these_kinds/">5 upvotes and <em>10</em> downvotes</a>.</p>

<p>That article is very well-written, very damning, and does <em>not</em> deserve 10 downvotes in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> after mere minutes!</p>

<p>And finally:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Monsanto Pinned for Dumping Vile Smelling Toxic Waste Poisons at UK Town</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, it&#39;s currently at <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/223uwx/monsanto_pinned_for_dumping_vile_smelling_toxic/">5 upvotes at 2 downvotes</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, it&#39;s <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/223ux4/monsanto_pinned_for_dumping_vile_smelling_toxic/">8 upvotes to <em>10</em> downvotes</a>.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we&#39;re dealing with just a couple or a few &quot;problem&quot; users...I&#39;d say it&#39;s closer to a dozen, or a few with sockpuppets (and no life, whatsoever).</p>

<p>Unless there are 10-20 accounts who just sit here refreshing the new queue repeatedly and downvoting everything.  And if that&#39;s the case, dare I suggest that no sane person would spend their time doing something like that unless they were being compensated in some way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely bots. Which is why I asked above how they were dealt with. If they were shadow banned I&#39;d be surprised if the bot operators noticed that quickly unless they are using many, many accounts and the few bans handed out did nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assuming bots, it could, in theory just be one user running many simultaneously.</p>

<p>The problem with the whole thing is that creating a bot doesn&#39;t require a legit account.  No matter how many accounts are banned, they can just create new ones, link the bots to them, rinse and repeat.</p>

<p>I like the idea someone had the other day about requiring a comment before you can up or downvote.  That&#39;s abou the only thing I can think of that might actually mitigate the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and you can see it for yourself. If you create 10 accounts, and use each of the ten to upvote (or downvote) a single post, the vote fuzzing will show and you&#39;ll end up with a total of something like 10/9, even though all you did was upvote.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a little more than <em>just</em> IP address, as obviously a large corporation will have many reddit users coming out of one public IP, and they wouldn&#39;t want to discard all of those votes.</p>

<p>But using IP address and other identifying information, Reddit knows what handles map to a single machine, and in some circumstances, to a single person (from multiple machines.)</p>

<p>The vote filter is pretty sophisticated in order to help prevent brigading by a single person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The spam filter is adaptive. Obvious attempts to rig it are already covered, but yes, it can be deceived in this way.</p>

<p>On the day of this post, the /new queue had items in it that were 10-15 minutes old with 10-15 downvotes. You won&#39;t be able to do that with a single machine. That has to be done with separate accounts, from separate source IPs.</p>

<p>Unless your accounts have already been flagged as brigaders, you will be able to register multiple votes on a single item if the votes come in a time period that is less frequent than than the average vote period.</p>

<p>For example, if a post in the /new queue of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> historically gets 1 vote every three minutes, you will not be able to brigade it with a single machine faster than 1 vote every three minutes. The filter will pick up on an irregular number of votes in an average time period. Your accounts will then be flagged and future attempts will fail.</p>

<p>So yes, one vote every five minutes probably won&#39;t get you flagged, but that won&#39;t make much progress on brigading a post, either.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s a little more than just IP address</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I used the term <em>strict</em> anywhere, but you&#39;re right, I didn&#39;t add context to the IP filtering, although I suggested it&#39;s not simply IP based.</p>

<p>IPs cause fuzzing when votes arrive within a range of time variance. When votes arrive within this range from unique IPs they are allowed. When they arrive from the same IP they are fuzzed.</p>

<p>Outside the range all votes are fuzzed.</p>

Because I&#39;ve seen a lot of posts on here that get down voted a ridiculous amount and I can&#39;t believe why anyone would do so.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the obvious difference is that instead of posting in a subreddit frequently accused of anti-semitism and censorship of any contrary ideas (while championing itself as a bastion of free speech) with a population of less than a quarter million users and less than a thousand users at a time you&#39;re posting to subs that have upwards of 3 million users (one of which is a default sub) and more than 3 thousand people active at a time.  </p>

<p>That and your differences aren&#39;t that significant.  Particularly because your sample size (in terms of total votes) is so small, individual votes <em>appear</em> to have a greater effect overall without any serious differences.  for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>example one has a difference of 2 votes for to 1 vote in opposition</li>
<li>example two has a difference of 2 votes for to 5 votes in opposition</li>
<li>example three has a difference of 3 votes for to 2 votes in opposition</li>
</ul>

<p>for the majority of your examples then, there is a cumulative variance of only a single vote, and your largest variance has only a value of 3.  From a statistical analysis standpoint, you simply lack enough evidence to make a credible case for clear brigading due to your tiny sample size.  However if I had to make an analysis, the odds of this being a brigade are less than 15 percent or so (you can see how the small sample size is skewing my results, as anyone who&#39;s familiar with statistics is used to working with much larger differences, in the 90%s typically)</p>

<p>You also fail to account for the myriad of <em>other</em> variables that affect success with regards to a post.  Timing is a critical one, which you have failed to notate here in the example you present.  Also random chance is a major part, which covers the attitudes and types of people viewing (something which may not vary if you submitted them as a bunch i.e. all on the same tuesday at the same time, or if you submitted them at consistent times...for example every monday at 4pm for a three week period, when the same group of people in general would be browsing this sub) as well as a bunch of other random factors.</p>

<p>tl;dr your statistical analysis sucks.  Take a bigger sample size to get clearer results.  Upwards of 30 datapoints are typically necessary to eliminate the random noise of an experiment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While your verbose explanation contains a lot of language to sound reasonable, it overlooks something significant. A larger subreddit (frontpage type) should have more total votes. The fact that a smaller subreddit is showing more votes and with most of them being downvotes is quite significant, and you simply buried that fact in less relevant information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea:  Logical analysis is how we conclude reasonably on topics we form hypotheses about.  This, logically speaking, lacks the proper sample size to be quantifiable, and requires more testing before a conclusion can be reached.</p>

<p>Clearly, however, OP and many in this thread are going with what they <em>feel</em> ignoring that logically this proves nothing due to the small sample size.  Not to mention reddit has a vote fuzzing algorithm, meaning that even what you see with RES isn&#39;t always accurate.  Yet despite this people are jumping to conclusions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I looked through /new and it&#39;s pretty obvious that there is some brigading going on. No other /new queue looks like that.</p>

<p>But I&#39;d like to point out that there are two possibilities here. Obviously the first possibility (and most likely imo) is that there is a a group of users who intentionally down vote posts in /new. It&#39;s not one person using multiple handles, because that would not have the same effect. It must be multiple unique accounts (from different source IPs.)</p>

<p>However, the same result could occur from a user or users running multiple accounts from the same machine trying to vote /new posts UP. The vote fuzzer will detect that and apply downvotes for each brigaded upvote. The fuzzer is actually more interested in brigaded upvotes than it is downvotes, for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>So if any <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> folks are trying to brigade UP votes, you might be causing more harm than good.</p>

<p>I think this is a serious issue as if it can be done to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> it can be done anywhere.</p>

<p>What about what TRP does? they restrict votes and comments using rules of community.</p>

<p>I do not think trolling of any kind should be allowed here, it muddies the water too much. Like troll posts should get /u/ immediately banned.</p>

<p>Or I would go the other way, that there is so much requirement of anonymity with reddit and so many ways to game the system, that there can be no sensible discussion of conspiracies here as the entire system of reddit is itself a conspiracy.</p>

<p>The only things we know about the actual conspiracies are because professionals and investigators have put their actual names and reputations on the line(not usernames, but actual names). I trust Michael Ruppert, Julian Assange, Snowden, Ted Gunderson, Max Blumenthal, because I am compelled to believe that their person would not be corrupted.</p>

<p>A username could be easily corrupted at any time, the person behind the veil could be anyone with any objectives.</p>

<p>This problem though is not just some silly reddit thing, networked computers give the ability for pure democratic speech and vote tallying, but only if these cheap tricks for gaming the system can be prevented.</p>

<p>bitcoin is onto something with a decentralized time-based community encryption algorithm, that does verify the owner of a coins identity, and along these lines there is a way to determine if any user on any site is who they say they are.</p>

<p>You will find the authoritarians and people who benefit by the current illegitimate election methods doing everything in their power to keep all online communities, including bitcoin, unstable, lest their power be challenged with a true alternative.</p>

<p>We have the tech to revolutionize government and demonstrate how illegitimate the powers of the world are, either we get into that fight here or we admit defeat and take our ideas and evidence elsewhere. </p>

<p>Look at how much effort the Democrats put into scrubbing the default subreddits of so much news about the Obama administration shitting on liberal voters.  Look at the military propaganda, and see how much negative attention you get from negative posts about the US military.  (Remember &quot;That&#39;s not a child, that&#39;s a dog.&quot;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Step 1: Look for common denominators in the downvotes</p>

<ul>
<li>i.e. User X has been downvoting every or almost every submission constantly, as well as user Y, Z, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 2: See how many of those common denominators have similarities</p>

<ul>
<li>i.e. User X has an IP very similar to user Y and Z suggesting that these are the same person using sockpuppet accounts</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 3: See how many of them have alternate accounts</p>

<ul>
<li>i.e. Look for accounts using the same IP or very similar to</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 4: See how many of the original accounts linked to the previous ones belong in a sub group</p>

<ul>
<li>i.e. The users, or most of the users, that have been downvoting constantly this sub have other accounts that show that they are members of r/conspiratard, for example</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 5: Deal with it accordingly by use of an IP ban mask type that covers the range of IPs each user has been using in order to deny them the possibility to change IP and make new accounts</p>

<ul>
<li>i.e User X has 5 accounts, all of which use an IP range between 192.168.1.100 and 192.168.1.120, apply IP ban mask 192.168.1.*, for example</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 6: If the trouble users had a common core investigate it further and if it is found to be constantly responsible for the other problematic situations similar or equal to this one issue a final warning to the sub mods, if they allow it to continue then shut it down</p>

<hr/>

<p>PS: This, of <del>corse</del> course, can only be done by site admins only and will only work if the downvote brigadiers are not using proxy. This problem would also be prevented/avoided if they had a system that detects this behaviour and suspends their account until it is investigated, although it could never be perfect it would still work in most of the cases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s something you need to be aware of in your evaluation of this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Pay very close attention to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/223wdk/downvotes_downvotes_everywhere_according_to_the/cgj5d2x">this subthread under this post</a>.</p>

<p>The important point I want to make here is this:</p>

<p>If someone is attempting to sockpuppet vote, <strong>up or down does not matter</strong>, you get skewed results.</p>

<p>If you have 10 sockpuppets and you try to mass upvote a post, it will show (because it tracks your full routing address) 10/-9 (basically only counting you as one upvote).</p>

<p>Likewise, if someone downvotes 10 times, it will show 9/-10.</p>

<p>This is, in my honest opinion, the effect we&#39;re seeing here. You have 2 or 3 <em>people</em> with 2 or 3 <em>accounts each</em> that are sockpuppet voting. This results in a <em>net</em> of either positive or negative 2 or 3.</p>

<p><strong><em>Most Importantly</em></strong>: <strong>For those who thought they could offset downvotes by sockpuppet upvoting</strong> - that&#39;s called cheating to defeat cheaters and reddit&#39;s processing nullifies your efforts. Just visit the new queue with one account and vote accordingly: one time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem i see with that is people purposely upvoting ridiculous content like bigfoot, ghosts and lizard people which always seems to get lumped into the word conspiracy and will make it easier to discredit this subreddit...discrediting by association.</p>

<p>I see it on CNN, before they say something ridiculous they&#39;ll use the word conspiracy then say black holes took the plane which turns the word conspiracy to mean something implausible or just crazy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like the word anarchy, it simply means without rulers but has taken on the definition of meaning violence because model teleprompter readers will show pictures of violence and use the word anarchy or anarchist so that becomes the definition to the viewer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps an added layer of security for voting is needed?</p>

<p>Few ideas...</p>

<p>1) Give each user 2-5 votes a day on the /new sub
2) Any user that uses up 50% of their votes in a day constantly shouldn&#39;t be allowed to down vote something below 0 but they can up vote.
3) Some form of captcha verification if a user votes to much to quickly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is a serious issue as if it can be done to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> it can be done anywhere.  </p>

<p>What about what TRP does? they restrict votes and comments using rules of community.  </p>

<p>I do not think trolling of any kind should be allowed here, it muddies the water too much.  Like troll posts should get /u/ immediately banned.  </p>

<p>Or I would go the other way, that there is so much requirement of anonymity with reddit and so many ways to game the system, that there can be no sensible discussion of conspiracies here as the entire system of reddit is itself a conspiracy. </p>

<p>The only things we know about the actual conspiracies are because professionals and investigators have put their actual names and reputations on the line(not usernames, but actual names).  I trust Michael Ruppert, Julian Assange, Snowden, Ted Gunderson, Max Blumenthal, because I am compelled to believe that their person would not be corrupted. </p>

<p>A username could be easily corrupted at any time, the person behind the veil could be anyone with any objectives. </p>

<p>This problem though is not just some silly reddit thing, networked computers give the ability for pure democratic speech and vote tallying, but only if these cheap tricks for gaming the system can be prevented.  </p>

<p>bitcoin is onto something with a decentralized time-based community encryption algorithm, that does verify the owner of a coins identity, and along these lines there is a way to determine if any user on any site is who they say they are. </p>

<p>You will find the authoritarians and people who benefit by the current illegitimate election methods doing everything in their power to keep all online communities, including bitcoin, unstable, lest their power be challenged with a true alternative.  </p>

<p>We have the tech to revolutionize government and demonstrate how illegitimate the powers of the world are, either we get into that fight here or we admit defeat and take our ideas and evidence elsewhere.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>here&#39;s what the deleted comment said :</p>

<p>Let me help you kids out. In case you haven&#39;t figured out... the more you complain about it, the more it will happen. People enjoy trolling this sub, your paranoia is amusing, so when they see you freak out over something that is under their control, you are giving them the power to manipulate you to amuse themselves. I, myself, an unpaid visitor, immediately opened new and downvoted almost every single thread after seeing this post, sometimes I&#39;ll do it with a few accounts, especially OPs, just because I know it makes him spend all his time feeling like the center of a big conspiracy. His/your reaction, threads like these and others in srd, is what I do it for.
You guys always get burned and embarrassed by your desire for inter-reddit conspiracies, and it will likely be your downfall as discourse levels descend to things like this, serious users leave, and an increase in dangerous idiots like your sandy hook PI come in. Look at all the black eyes this sub has gotten in the last little while, it comes from thinking you are part of some grand conspiracy by sitting here redditing. You have a big gap between what you think is going on and what the reality of the world is, and people enjoy messing with you because of it. I check SRD and this place everyday purely for entertainment. You have drawn lots of attention because you have gone looking for it by positing yourself at the center of global affairs here on reddit. The truth is you are just wrong in such an offensive way as to draw negative attention and moral indignation, easy to manipulate due to your unstable relationship to the truth of how the world works, and amusing to watch overreact due to your reliance on imagination and self-righteousness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps the best option would be for everyone here to submit their threads both in r/conspiracy and r/conspiratard, since they are so obsessed with what the people they despise, insult and mock 24/7 think might as well and post everything there. </p>

<p>Maybe that way they don&#39;t feel the urge to brigade the threads here and instead end up staying more contained in their circlejerk corner.</p>

<p>EDIT; I am being sarcastic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting, but not surprising.</p>

<p>Look at how much effort the Democrats put into scrubbing the default subreddits of so much news about the Obama administration shitting on liberal voters.  Look at the military propaganda, and see how much negative attention you get from negative posts about the US military.  (Remember &quot;That&#39;s not a child, that&#39;s a dog.&quot;)</p>

<p>With reddit the way it is, it probably costs less than a single TV infomercial.</p>
