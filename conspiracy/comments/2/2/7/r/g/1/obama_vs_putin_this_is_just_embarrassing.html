        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So everyone knows of the dominant petrodollar system that runs the world.  Russia, China, Iran, Brazil, etc all want more freedom and would like to see the USD replaced.  This would eliminate the numerous advantages the US enjoys due to reserve currency status.  Here is where it stops making sense for me:</p>

<p>Obama threatens Putin with sanctions, which in effect, would force Russia to remove themselves from the US petrodollar system and create alternate system.  Ok, as a result, Russia announces a new gold backed currency system(still just an idea) and a $20B oil-for-gold deal with Iran (who was already kicked outta the system).  Russia and Iran have power through their oil and nat. gas, so forcing these players out will lead to their trading partners being also forced out, in order to continue to get the flow of goods from Russia.  This would encourage the creation of agreements and a new structure to bypass the dollar for energy trades, which is where a lot of the big money internationally comes from.  </p>

<p>Ok, so Obama puts sanctions in place, Putin uses it as an opportunity to push back against the USD system without risk of a fallout among trading partners or the world, since it is the US forcing their hands.  They find a way to survive (oil for gold deal) and now Obama is threatening more sanctions if that deal goes through.  </p>

<p>What does Obama expect to happen by enforcing more sanctions on a country that doesn&#39;t really need imports?  Lets say Russia is more important to their trading partners than they are to Russia, pushing Russia out will inevitable force others out to continue to work with Russia, leading to an alliance (BRICS etc) stronger and stronger each day, with it&#39;s strength stemming from the weakness of the US system.  </p>

<p>If he ramps up sanctions, it would give Russia, China, India etc more incentive to make their move out of the dollar sooner than later, to align with the east (russia, china) as opposed to the west (US, Nato, EU).  Russia would be forced to create a system independent than the USD system, and as sanctions get stronger, so will that system. USA was building a box to control Russia, and instead of Russia being squeezed, they flipped it and now the US is finding itself pressed up against the sides.</p>

<p>The issue comes when other countries realize that our (US) prospects for growth are very slim, esp considering the economic position, corruption, corporate influence, and waning strength of the USD compared to Russia, China, etc.  Once the intl community sees us as weak and not viable for the future, they will bail into a safer, less corrupt system.  They still hold our debt, so they must be sure to pull the rip cord before actually pulling it, because they will be sacrificing the values of their USD assets in exchange for future economic freedom.  </p>

<p>Enter the Russian system, the system that would be years away from implementation if not for Obama&#39;s financial sanctions.  If this was Iran nothing would really matter, but Russia has the strength and influence to lead a paradigm shift from west to east  and they may never want back into our system. </p>

<p>This would all be taking place over the next 10 years, so it&#39;s not like it&#39;ll happen over night, but the writing is on the wall and Putin seems to be taking actions that elicit a certain response from Obama (which he undoubtedly will provide) in order to complete his plans without having to take responsibility or heat for starting the move out of USD.  </p>

<p>Or not...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if this is intentional?   I&#39;ve found myself saying &quot;That was stupid&quot; enough with regards to what the U.S. Government is doing that I one day decided what would make it &quot;Not Stupid&quot;.</p>

<p>ANSWER: Crash the system, so they can rush in with the solution of one world government.   The Hegelian Dialectic at work.   They&#39;ve already demonstrated they use this technique, and it is the only thing I&#39;ve come up with makes all the &quot;stupid&quot; ideas &quot;not stupid&quot; if that is indeed the goal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, I believe this is intentional as well. US is a war based economy and they need larger and larger wars to inflate the bubbles, then crash them, then step in and buy it up all, consolidating their assets. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly what they have been tasked with preventing.  They have not prevented one.  And inf fact, they made the issues we have today infinitely worse by propping the house of cards up for so long.</p>

<p>I guess the silver lining here is that while they&#39;ve been doing this, they&#39;ve driven down the price of precious metals.  I highly recommend anyone reading this convert some of their soon to be even more worthless.fiat into cold , hard metals.  Silver and gold of you can afford it.  Silver is running a mere $19.95 per ozt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is where I&#39;m at with it.</p>

<p>One of the greatest tricks our current system plays out on everybody is getting the population to think of them as inept bumblers. Because its harder to want to destroy and get rid of a bumbler than a calculating psychopath. Its the same reason any media always refers to Bush W&#39;s &#39;tragic mistake&#39; with regards to Iraq. That cowboy idiot, <em>gawsh.</em> Didn&#39;t know what he was doin&#39;. </p>

<p>They&#39;d rather be seen as stupid than evil and petty, and greedy and destructive and narccissistic. Which is what they are. </p>

<p>This conflict, whatever it turns out to be, will be a very useful vehicle for them to push their sick agenda(s) onto the world. In the meantime they&#39;ll just keep playing stupid and playing victim.</p>

<p>Either way they win though. If the get an honest man who plays by the rules, they just cheat - and thereby get to control him. If they get a corrupt man in power, they can just buy him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a plan devised by a group known as &quot;The club of Rome&quot;, and this is their plan for the world. Please notice Russia(5) and the US/North America(1). I also suggest reading a little up on this said &quot;club&quot;, it&#39;s goals fit well with what&#39;s going on globally right now.</p>

<p>Here is the world map according to the group:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So Japan is on its own and the Middle East is together with South America? What is the source for this map?</p>

<p>I personally think they will consolidate the Asian union with Japan and Oceania, African Union will include South Africa and north African countries,  the Middle east will be part of the Asian Union. The American Union will not be divided into North and South. Russia and some central asian countries will be consolidated into a Eurasian union. They will aim for as much centralization as possible. </p>

<p>My only question is whether Putin is in on the game or is truly a rogue player. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your research is great, but your perspective is wrong.</p>

<p>Consider that collapse of the petrodollar is a <em>mathematical inevitability</em>. The inherent problem is that global trade hinges on the petrodollar. If the petrodollar collapses unexpectedly or abruptly, players with real skin in the game get hurt. </p>

<p>Therefore, it&#39;s necessary to develop a plan to structure the collapse, allowing the players to limit their exposure over a definite timeline of events. If you create the crisis before it happens, you can know what the fallout will be because you control all variables at play. </p>

<p>Specifically, with the USG forcing Russia&#39;s hand, the collapse can be blamed on the American Liberals, the Obama Administration and their terrible foreign policy. The narrative will frame the US banks as the real victims as they are locked out of the new exchanges for their criminal tendencies. The banks will have no choice but to seize the assets of their customers as the cost of doing business in a newly adverse market. All the important money is already out of the American financial markets, and what&#39;s left is trying to take whatever isn&#39;t bolted down with it. </p>

<p>I expect the bottom to drop out inside of the next 18 months. And they&#39;ll blame you and me, the taxpayer for it. The real story will never get told. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That all sounds like it makes sense.  Wealth confiscation has been the name of the game, with examples such as MFGlobal, Cyprus, in addition to the EU and USs open plans to have forced &quot;Bail-ins&quot;, instead of bailouts.  A bail-in is where the banks are recapitalized by the customers and investors, and not the state.  One other thing, to support the dollar, in the future a certain percentage of your IRA account may be reallocated (without your consent) to buy bonds, which is on the same thread as outright confiscation through a wealth tax or catastrophe.  Thanks for the addition to the post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anytime this idiot asshole refers to Crimea, all I can say in my head is Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya.  He has no basis whatsoever to go after Putin.  Putin is actually quite clearly the good guy here.  The people have spoken very clearly on what they desire.  And with the lawful president asking for his help in a written letter, the assistance (others would and have incorrectly claim invasion) was completely in the right.</p>

<p>Now an unelected banker, against the wishes of all protestors gas been criminally and unconstitutionally placed in control of the country, while we clear out all of their gold reserves.  Likely to pay back Germany, as the rest of the gold reserves have long since been spent. &quot;Paid&quot; illegally to the FED to sell, resell, and securitize only on paper.  The house of cards is collapsing as we watch.  </p>

<p>Obama&#39;s actions may be the final straw for all of this to come crashing down.  The widespread corruption hastened and fully ensured its demise.  It&#39;s why they are now rigging everything blind before the wheels inevitably come off.  These cowards must never be allowed to ruin our financial system again.  To have such unelected control over us.  Many of whom are highly suspect dual-citizens that do not care about America&#39;s future or children. They rape us until we are no more, then they suck someone else&#39;s blood for a century, again, inevitably destroying them as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, all within the realm of the acts and rhetoric we are seeing, now add in the NWO crowd, throw in the anti-government libertarian lords, stand back and watch the dust up. Time for more than one group to exert all that power that has been carefully arranged into a nice pyramid. </p>

<p>The world economy is controlled by a small number of people, all linked.
No longer cooperating with each other, but busy carving out their piece of the pie to control.  </p>

<p>The pie gets to watch, and since labor is no longer part of the long term equation, that is all that is to be allowed to the 7 billion people, not part of the few hundred. </p>
