<p>If you accept something as fact, question that shit!</p>

<p>Ask why?</p>

<p>Keep an open fucking mind please!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know why people don&#39;t keep an open mind? It&#39;s painful. It hurts to be open. You are vulnerable when you are open. If what you base your beliefs upon can be changed in an instant by new information, that throws your entire life out of balance until you assimilate the new information into your existing belief system, and that can take months or years. While you are in an unbalanced, chaotic state, trying to adjust to new information, you are weak. You cannot argue effectively because you don&#39;t know what you believe. YOu cannot lead effectively because you don&#39;t know where you are going.</p>

<p>Strong people, leaders, are  certain. They don&#39;t allow doubts to enter their heads. Their certain conviction makes them strong. They can out-argue and out-buffalo others because they are so sure they are right. It&#39;s a comforting position to be in. Strong. Sure of yourself. Never suffering uncertainty or doubts.</p>

<p>The trouble is, unless you open your mind, you cannot learn anything new. You are like a fly trapped in a piece of amber -- you never change. You are strong, because your certainties make you strong, but it is quite possible that your certainties are incorrect, and you are never going to learn this, because you are too terrified to open your mind and let doubt enter there.</p>

<p>Most people want the reassuring certainty. They grasp whatever perspective on reality is fed to them, and they cling to it, because it is a source of comfort and strength to them. Getting them to open their minds to new possibilities is difficult. Only if they have an innate desire to seek the truth will they ever do this, and only slowly and by small degrees, so that they are not overwhelmed by doubt. Doubt can kill. Doubt can destroy a life. That is why people are so afraid of it. They would rather cling to lies than suffer the agonies of uncertainty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I try to be a decent person, but I&#39;m not naive enough to believe that I can ever remove greed from even my own human nature. It&#39;s a self preservation mechanism at it&#39;s core, it&#39;s just some people either can&#39;t/won&#39;t control it. When those people have insane amounts of influence/resources, which is often how they got those things unless by inheriting it, that&#39;s when you get the shit that happens in the world, and it&#39;s always been that way. Absolute power corrupts absolutely as the saying goes, but it&#39;s not like being powerful is the sole catalyst in making people this way. </p>
