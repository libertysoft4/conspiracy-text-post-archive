        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is it, I&#39;m quitting Reddit.</p>

<p>A few accounts, a few days old, are able to downvote legitimate and honest discussion to the end. This is a serious flaw in the system. Only aged and verified accounts should be able to downvote.</p>

<p>I took a pro-Russia position on the Crimea issue because it really did look like an artificially created crisis to justify more wars. The massive bombardment on mainstream media was typical of yet another Iraq. We&#39;ve all seen it time and again.</p>

<p>But the shills are mercyless. Everyone of my comments and posts will be downvoted to eternity. Their jokes and mocking and outright lies are the top comments on all of <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> stories. It&#39;s completely fake and planted discussions that stay at the top. People should know that. </p>

<p>Since any account can downvote, the shills create tens, hundreds of accounts, and destroy dissent. The downvote is supposed to clean up irrelevant posts, jokes, stupid memes, that sort of thing. Instead, jokes and crap are upvoted, and the downvote is used to silence disagreement.</p>

<p>I thought we had honest debate at <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> and thus my realization that it&#39;s all fake made start to report the shills and clone accounts. But it&#39;s no use. The shills are here too on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, I don&#39;t trust the mods or anything else on Reddit. </p>

<p>This is the epitome of <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> : these people are trained to lie, deceive and spread noise. It&#39;s unfortunate that several days old accounts can destroy an otherwise great subreddit. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/22d3hg/hey_rconspiracy_check_out_this_rworldnews_clown/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/22d3hg/hey_rconspiracy_check_out_this_rworldnews_clown/</a></p>

<p>And I&#39;m outta here. It&#39;s been fun. Goodbye.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t even understand why, if someone doesn&#39;t have the tenacity to deal with some downvotes have they ever been able to offer anything anyway?, I&#39;m not trying to offend them just don&#39;t understand why they&#39;d give up.I had an odd experience one night on reddit, I was posting on a sub I wouldn&#39;t normally post on, I was dealing with someone who wanted to use the term rape every time Julian Assange&#39;s  name was mentioned, after I asked them why they were doing that their answers stopped.</p>

<p>The thing I hope people understand is that the human subconscious  can&#39;t discern from a TV show or ad, if Oprah does a show about anorexia helping them but the advertising shows a heap of thin models they are worse off.The people that get paid for advertising know that and now you do if you didn&#39;t.Earth is bigger than reddit, while I think it is gamed I also think it&#39;s a distraction from other issues.</p>

<p>this is 100% true, and thats good advice,but sometimes shit just gets on top of you, you know, like when your having a REALLY shitty fucking day, except he probably felt like that every time he saw the little red envelope in the top corner of his screen. </p>

<p>i dont know man, i regularly have breaks now, sometimes i go days-weeks without even looking at it if i feel like a break. peoples limits are different, probably depending on their &quot;real&quot; life problems i suppose.</p>

<p>i dont think his main problem was karma, it was getting fucked around by a circle of cunts that get off wasting peoples time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking as one of the &quot;cunts&quot; you mentioned, the thing is I genuinely recognized this idiots name from posting too many idiot comments, which is a side effect of acting like a total idiot.</p>

<p>His main problem was he acted like a tool, too many people took notice, and he came inches away from having a panic attack induced by his own self-fulfilling prophecy. He refuses to believe those that told him to STFU are different people, that he is right and it&#39;s the rest of the world with a problem.</p>

<p>People who could articulate as to why they were taking a &quot;pro-Russian&quot; standpoint on the aforementioned issue I can&#39;t remember. I read their posts and genuinely took into consideration what they said. His stance was not &quot;pro-Russian&quot; as much as it was &quot;anti-west&quot;, which I still couldn&#39;t care less about, until the way he expressed those opinions was both fucktarded and frequent enough that it caused name recognition. If you constantly post idiot things, hundreds upon hundreds of times in the same sub, it&#39;s a consequence of your actions that earns you the recognition. You&#39;ve created a brand, and now whether you like it or not that&#39;s what a majority of people see. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter that I&#39;m only 12 days after my account creation. In fact, my very very first comment, that I signed up to the site to make, was gilded. If you go through my post history, there&#39;s no real history of being a cunt (unless it&#39;s in response to cuntery). </p>

<p>What the largest problem I see is that the user couldn&#39;t stand enough to have any introspect and ask himself: &#39;Is it me&quot;? If you&#39;re constantly acting like that, and blaming everyone else for your problems, that could be a sign of an underlying mental health condition. There&#39;s no reason, no proof, no cause for me to have multiple accounts. This is a case of a user who has spent too much time looking into dark corners and trying to find what others can&#39;t see, only to be deluded by his own search. At that point, everyone else becomes the problem and asking yourself questions, if the problem is you, doesn&#39;t fit the narrative.</p>

<p>I get my news from a large, large range of sources. I come to reddit because it&#39;s convenient in that it aggregates them. Al-Jazeera is about the only &quot;mainstream&quot; media outlet that I read because it&#39;s, as near as I can tell, fact based reporting more than almost any other major outlet. I go to <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> and <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> because I get to see things that I wouldn&#39;t have if I didn&#39;t. I don&#39;t stick to the &quot;hot&quot; topics, I thumb through HOURS worth of &quot;new&quot; posts and always check out &quot;rising&quot; and &quot;controversial&quot;. I come to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to get alternative viewpoints that are otherwise ostracized in those subs because I think it&#39;s helpful to a critical thinking process to consider every possible viewpoint for a situation. It makes you more aware.</p>

<p>So, really, stop thinking that everyone else was the problem. It wasn&#39;t. I&#39;d be more than happy to further engage this topic if you really think it&#39;s a necessity, though I would hope you realize that it&#39;s not.</p>

<p>Not EVERYTHING that the media puts out is wrong or is creating some misleading narrative.  Many times the narrative already fits and there is no need to lie.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been researching and tracking Putin for years.  If you like conspiracies, he&#39;s a great subject. A criminal gangster of the highest order.</p>

<p>Just because our countries criminal gansters criticize theirs does not make it inherently untrue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Putin is actually aligned with the same banking mafiosa that the U.S. is involved with.  He&#39;s no different than U.S/U.K./Israeli leaders.</p>

<p>They are playing a huge game of good cop/bad cop just like Democrats and Republicans do.</p>

<p>Look at Gazprom for instance.  Signing huge deals with Israel and U.S. companies.  Russia is helping the U.S. in Afghanistan, Libya, Mali and all the countries it pretends to be opposing the U.S.  It joined the WTO.  It is with the U.S. on the war on terrorism, the war against drugs, and the war against pirates.  These countries are allies if you look closely and the posturing is good  cop/bad cop strategy.  </p>

<p>Then try to stop taking things too hard. I sometimes get downvoted, or corrected or called a name because of the immaturity in some people, but I&#39;m willing to put up facts and arguments indefinitely until I&#39;m proven wrong and not let it get to me personally.</p>

<p>Remember, <em>it&#39;s only reddit</em>. It&#39;s not your parents or your boss or anybody that matters. Just shake it off because you have to realize that you&#39;re never going to live in a world where everyone agrees with you.</p>

<p>You can surround yourself with like minded friends in real life or on certain websites but redditors are not your friends or like minded citizens of your world; they&#39;re anonymous people online with all kinds of ideas (some brilliant, some crazy).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen it with the 9/11 truth community, with progressive blogs, with conspiracy and alternative forums, and with WWII revisionism and anti Zionist forums, etc.  It&#39;s an age-old strategy because it&#39;s so effective.  </p>

<p>Why does Reddit want to know what you look like for? There can be no good coming from it. I thought about my stance on issues like Israel, 9/11, the Bushes, Clinton et al and thought fuck this, these people must have a portfolio on my opinions. </p>

<p>So now I&#39;m gonna delete my reddit account every so often. It&#39;ll probably make no difference besides piece of mind in my own little world, but it does give me the added bonus of not giving a fuck about upvotes, Reddit gold bullshit or what some dickwad from conspiritard thinks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you&#39;re totally missing the point. The kid didn&#39;t turn off the system because he wanted to play a different game, sweetheart. He turned it off because he didn&#39;t want to lose/be shown he was wrong. The kid would turn the game back on, play again, and jam his finger back down on the power button when I started winning again. Don&#39;t try to argue with me if you don&#39;t even understand fully what I&#39;m talking about. </p>

<p>Edit: and the last time I checked, 2 ten year olds playing super smash brothers on the GameCube isn&#39;t rigged... Conspiracy nutjob. Not everything is &quot;rigged&quot; or a &quot;set-up.&quot; Sometimes the world just isn&#39;t what you want it to be and you just have to accept that instead of making up stories to make yourself feel better.</p>

<p>You are a good example why OP is frustrated with this sub.  You and your pestilent <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> ilk have infested this place and thwart honest and productive discussions.  </p>

<p>It is you and your <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> buddies that are turning off the game console in the middle of the game.  Like when you hurl insults like &quot;conspiracy nutjob&quot; and &quot;sweetheart&quot; and refer to people here as &quot;kids.&quot;  But instead of going home after you ruin the game you stay in the basement taunting the rest of us and telling us that there&#39;s nothing we can do about your antics. . . you will shut the game down anytime you want and the mods don&#39;t seem particularly motivated to clean out the garbage.</p>

<p>OP is going somewhere else to play his game.  He wants a fair game as free from <a href="/r/conspiratards">/r/conspiratards</a> as possible.</p>

Not everything is about you, I was talking about myself, dumbass. Secondly, there is no &quot;truth&quot; on the conspiracy subreddit. Thirdly, the last time someone said &quot;ilk&quot; was about 200 years ago, so unless you&#39;re discussing how the War of 1812 was a setup by the government I suggest you update your vocabulary. Fourth, I shouldn&#39;t have even brought up the kid and the video games example because you, for some ungodly reason, cannot seem to comprehend it and keep trying to turn it to your favor. If you&#39;re trying to prove a point, how about you think for yourself instead of trying to hijack my own words? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, I think with the Russia/Crimea conflict there is a lot of honest opinion around. I am not disputing that shills exist, they definitively do. But I for example felt the same as you but I was on Crimea&#39;s side. For a while I felt completely the minority as it seems that most people are on Russia&#39;s side. YOu are telling me now it is the other way round, so I can only deduct that there is an equal and opposite amount from both sides and it hurts when people disagree with you, whatever you think.</p>

<p>Not everyone is a shill you know and those that are I can&#39;t care less about, they are the sad ones and won&#39;t influence my own research and beliefs. </p>

<p>To quit over it is your right but why do people have to announce that they quit? WHo really cares? What do they expect? A &quot;no,no, please stay, you are one of our best?&quot; -plea?</p>

<p>I personally can segregate shills from people with differing opinions and reddit is at the moment still the place we are &#39;allowed&#39; [more or less] to discuss injustice and the downfall of society. So personally I will stay and keep the discussions going with as much evidence and heartfelt arguments as I can muster.</p>

<p>Running away will never do any good apart from getting rid of quitters.</p>

Naturally, unless drastic steps are taken by the administrators, the conversations will migrate elsewhere.  Sadly, so will the shills.
