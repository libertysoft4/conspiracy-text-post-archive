        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Everytime i come to r/conspiracy i see so many nut jobs screaming conspiracy about absolutely anything and everything, it seems as soon as something is on the news someone has to automatically assume there is a conspiracy behind it and it isnt as it seems. 
Now dont get me wrong im all for the conspiracy theorist community because quite often there is more to a story than what gets talked about in the media and such. Im very cynical and sceptical by nature and will always question whether or not we are being told the truth,especially if there is evidence of such.</p>

<p>Now my question is, do you think the &quot;extreme conspiracy theorists&quot; give the community a bad name by calling conspiracy on absolutely everything and do they make the rest of us look bad? Personally i think a large percentage of threads seem to be bullshit and people like to cry conspiracy on anything and that hurts the community as a whole cause it makes us all look like nut jobs.</p>

<p>Me personally im looking for the truth, not a conspiracy! I like to look at all the information and then from my own opinion based on evidence and not my opinion of how fucked the government can be. I think it more people would take notice if there wasn&#39;t so many bullshit posts claiming conspiracy with absolutely no evidence at all.</p>

<p>The best way to attack in the information age is not to oppose the target group, it is to pretend to be one of the target group and then spout crazyness thus heaping ridicule on them and making anything else they say suspect.</p>

<p>That being said, some of it is probably young, new or paranoid posters.</p>

They do it to try to discredit the real witnesses, because most think that these witnesses did the same thing. They also try to discourage any people that are interested. The only way people are still &quot;believers&quot;, is because these people are witnesses themselves or have trusted relationships with the witnesses.</p>

<p>That being said, these types of conspiracy theories do hurt the image of the community in people&#39;s eyes.

    <div class="md"><p>Thats just it though. The people who don&#39;t want constructive discussion about conspiracies to take place have realized this flaw and are using it to discredit us.</p>

<p>I like to think of conspiracies as islands in an ocean. We have to navigate them with boats built for turbulent waters other wise we will not stay afloat. If we are too ridged in our thinking and hold our opinions too closely we are helpless to the strong winds and high waters.</p>

<p>The islands are all different on the suface, but underneath connect to the same continent, and this is where the root of the issue is. A lot of people don&#39;t put the pieces all together and treat each conspiracy as a small isolated incident.</p>

<p>*Elaborate surveillance grid covering the globe with the resources and capability to monitor any human being on the planet.
*Pedophile and sex trafficking rings interwoven with the top of the societal pyramid.</p>

<p>Those two things should not coexist unless the are directly linked. </p>

<p>This is a story I posted and it is not &quot;extreme&quot; by any definition of the term. </p>

<p>A young person has died whilst apparently alone in a house for reasons unknown. The post-mortem was inconclusive, so they are waiting on toxicology, but we can almost certainly <strong>rule out</strong> both suicide and drugs, as I&#39;ve explained in that thread.</p>

<p>This leaves &quot;natural causes&quot; and foul play. Again, I&#39;ve explained in the thread why foul play should not be ruled out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/22lw93/police_rush_to_declare_peaches_geldofs_sudden/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/22lw93/police_rush_to_declare_peaches_geldofs_sudden/</a></p>

<p>I am speculating, as I often do, but it is extrapolated on circumstantial evidence, and my hypothesis is plausible.</p>

<p>There are many many drugs that you dont need any paraphernalia for and still doesnt rule out anything as the family could of got rid of any to protect her reputation as well.</p>

<p>Your opinion is baseless and misinformed, the &quot;pedophiles&quot; she tweeted about were 2 young mothers that let the charged pedophile who is in prison rape their babies. They were merely 2 fucked up fans that did a fucked up and disgusting thing, they weren&#39;t high ranking officials of the government that would have had her killed. Yeah the death is suspicious, but any death of a young person would be met with questions. Theres no toxicology report and nothing more than the police&#39;s official stance on the matter.</p>

<p>Yes, that what&#39;s my post title suggests I think. You make it seem like I&#39;m claiming she was murdered by lizards on pogo sticks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but any death of a young person would be met with questions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, but Peaches is not an ordinary person. Her background, her links to the OTO, a cult associated with ritual child abuse, suggest she could know some very unpleasant individuals.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2599517/From-Scientology-libertine-cult-Ordo-Templi-Orientis-OTO-How-Peaches-obsessed-occult-spiritual-study.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2599517/From-Scientology-libertine-cult-Ordo-Templi-Orientis-OTO-How-Peaches-obsessed-occult-spiritual-study.html</a></p>

<p>The fact that she outed the two women who allowed Watkins to rape their babies might have made some other people nervous.</p>

<p>I am not making any claims - just setting out some arguments as to why the police saying that her death is &quot;non-suspicious&quot; is premature. They clearly have no idea how she died.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Marketing is a form of conspiracy though--it&#39;s trying to subtly influence people and often in secretive or manipulative or exploitative ways.  Also, much of the psychological lessons learned by marketers is used by the elite beyond just selling products . . . like going to war.  I think it&#39;s totally within the realm of appropriate discussion here.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just offer them for sale and offer factual information about the product at the location of sale.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to be manipulated with messages embedded in my entertainment and when out on the street to purchase things . . . or be told we need to live a consumption based lifestyle to be happy.</p>

<p>The way diamond rings were marketed to Americans is a perfect example.  This didn&#39;t used to be a custom yet industry crafted very effective messages to push Americans into this custom.  Same with female smoking (Edward Bernays&#39; campaign).</p>

<p>Kids are especially vulernable.  It&#39;s amazing how kids pick up on commercials and these are not simply conveying what the product is they are &quot;hooking&quot; the kids.  Think of the way candy is displayed at the checkout to get kids (and adults) to engage in impulse buying.</p>

<p>Think of the huge amount of money spent on how grocery stores are laid out.  </p>

<p>Television programming also subtly pushes products (the character drinks a coke).  And then there is the deceptive viral or social media marketing campaigns that make it seem like these are ground up fan bases for products when really they are top down marketing campaigns.  See Frontline&#39;s good segment on this: <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/generation-like/">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/generation-like/</a></p>

<p>There is all sorts of explicit and subtle manipulation going on.  Not to mention other deceit.  Like changing the packaging size to get us to spend more (a la Mr. Rooney&#39;s complaints).  Or planned obsolescence (like the lightbulb conspiracy).</p>

<p>Marketing is a very manipulative field.</p>

I think if there was more quality discussion and less illogical and imagined conspiracies, we would have a much better chance at promoting good discussions with a wider variety of people. As it stands now we have a small minority perpetuating a stigma of &quot;crazy conspiracy theorists&quot; and in my opinion that is really damaging</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humans are social animals.  Society is an organism made up of levels and levels of other organisms.  I tend to think the majority of events and their protrayal involve &quot;conspiracy&quot; of one type or another.  Accidents happen, but when they do, nobody wants to take the blame.  Hence, just about EVERYTHING is a conspiracy.</p>

<p>So yes, I am working from that fundamental understanding of human nature.  People and systems are stronger in numbers and people have the ability to plan ahead and thus work from an agenda.  Now when we bring economics into it, there is a pretty defined agenda.  So I take that premise and work backwards, yes.  Not everything HAS to be a conspiracy, but there&#39;s a good chance it is.  Test the official story and see if it works out.  Often it does not.  Then look for the context this event happened in.  History isn&#39;t a vacuum.</p>

<p>The issue is when people start making extreme leaps to form connections that probably don&#39;t exist, and when the conclusion we&#39;re working backwards from isn&#39;t just &quot;I think there might be a conspiracy here&quot;, but, &quot;I think Aliens did it&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This.  I&#39;ve been lurking here for years and years.  Used to comment under another name, but left.  Wild bullshit is a big problem here, almost as big as shilling from people that deny/disrupt/discredit the legit posters.  </p>

<p>Honestly if I was a shill, I think it would be easier to go in and stir up bullshit about random/outlandish theories and get others to upvote them to poison the well.  To a large extent I think this has already happened here.</p>

<p>A big problem is also stupid reddit infighting.  Reporting on censorship is good, essential even, but calling out random reddit users?  Crybaby posts about your own account?  Self-centered conspiracies?  This shit plagues this board and is one reason I think it lost its energy.  </p>

<p>What it takes is FACT BASED SOURCED AND WELL WRITTEN pieces that are convincing to people.  Usually if it involves you directly, or directly involves someone you don&#39;t like, and it doesn&#39;t illuminate a wider angle or system, it isn&#39;t worth posting.  Sadly most of what we get now is naval gazing.  </p>

<p>Considering the powers that be are masters of media and repetition, naval gazing is tantamount to hari-kari in terms of getting anything done. There&#39;s SO MUCH SHIT going on these days it&#39;s almost overwhelming.  I think we all just need to pick a topic, figure out a way to express, get smart on it, and start talking about shit that matters.  That&#39;s how you solve this problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s discussed in that video but the method is basically say you are X label, I&#39;m a CONSPIRACY THEORIST and then spout nonsense thus discrediting the label you fall under.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtKT11WmQcY"><em>I&#39;m Alex Jones, I&#39;m a conspiracy theorist, I believe 9/11 was an inside job, also Juice boxes make kids gay</em></a></p>

<p>If anyone watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oap5AjKPWQE">Brian Dunning (calls himself a skeptic) on the Joe Rogan podcast</a>, it wasn&#39;t purposely done but Dunning made skeptics look bad by calling himself a skeptic then poorly arguing points, making things up, and saying people should have faith in science instead of looking at evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of what&#39;s posted here (if you look at the &#39;hot&#39; section) is basically alternative or mainstream news regarding topics conspiratorial in nature.</p>

<p>Some other, &quot;fringe&quot; posts can indeed be controversial, but I see no harm with allowing others to <em>speculate</em> on current events.</p>

<p>Why should people here censor themselves solely to appease the perception of others, who would mock them regardless of what they say or do?</p>

<p>What you&#39;re advocating is <strong>censorship</strong>. Again, I see nothing wrong others who choose to speculate on alleged conspiracies or the possibility of a conspiracy underlying a current event, no matter how remote a possibility. If you&#39;re only concerned with &quot;how it makes us look&quot; because some speculation doesn&#39;t fit your narrative, perhaps you should find another sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. I agree a large number of threads are bullshit, or at least I think they are bullshit, but what do I know. There&#39;s always people who believe more far-out stuff than another guy, and people who won&#39;t believe anything even with all the evidence in the world staring them in the face. It doesn&#39;t really matter.</p>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t think we can possibly know what is actual truth. It&#39;s all going to be colored through the lens of our own minds. Truth is something you approach, not something you arrive at. Even knowing the broad facts of what occurred, there&#39;s still more steps to take like why did this guy do this thing, and why did that guy do that thing.</p>

<p>Take the Apollo program, which is a conspiracy theory sure to bring up the hackles of 100,000+ subscribers to this subreddit. I don&#39;t know whether we went or not, but I think it&#39;s impossible for us to go today. Does that make me crazy, and do I make you look bad for thinking this? My worldview allows me to hold this thought in my head where other people would decide this is evidence of insanity.</p>

<p>You know they say eyewitness testimony is unreliable because one guy will see a green jacket while two others saw a red jacket. That guy was there and he saw what he saw. Compare the people and they see the different colors when you show them red and green. Maybe it was green when he saw it. That&#39;s the simplest explanation, it just doesn&#39;t fit into what we think we know about reality.</p>

<p>I know I don&#39;t know shit about the nature of reality. I also know nobody else knows shit about it either.</p>

<p>It&#39;s my belief that the more extreme 9-11 theories (such as the theory that the buildings were brought down by planted demolition charges) have been seeded throughout the Internet to turn attention away from Israel&#39;s involvement in the 9-11 terrorist attacks. The more crazy 9-11 theories, the less time is spent talking about the plausible theories, such the theory that Israel had foreknowledge of the attacks and failed to warn the US government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just offer them for sale and offer factual information about the product at the location of sale.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to be manipulated with messages embedded in my entertainment and when out on the street to purchase things . . . or be told we need to live a consumption based lifestyle to be happy.</p>

<p>The way diamond rings were marketed to Americans is a perfect example.  This didn&#39;t used to be a custom yet industry crafted very effective messages to push Americans into this custom.  Same with female smoking (Edward Bernays&#39; campaign).</p>

<p>Kids are especially vulernable.  It&#39;s amazing how kids pick up on commercials and these are not simply conveying what the product is they are &quot;hooking&quot; the kids.  Think of the way candy is displayed at the checkout to get kids (and adults) to engage in impulse buying.</p>

<p>Think of the huge amount of money spent on how grocery stores are laid out.  </p>

<p>Television programming also subtly pushes products (the character drinks a coke).  And then there is the deceptive viral or social media marketing campaigns that make it seem like these are ground up fan bases for products when really they are top down marketing campaigns.  See Frontline&#39;s good segment on this: <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/generation-like/">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/generation-like/</a></p>

<p>There is all sorts of explicit and subtle manipulation going on.  Not to mention other deceit.  Like changing the packaging size to get us to spend more (a la Mr. Rooney&#39;s complaints).  Or planned obsolescence (like the lightbulb conspiracy).</p>

<p>Marketing is a very manipulative field.</p>
