<p>There&#39;s more cut-and-dry things to go to the mattresses for, like wealth inequality, rich people being above the law and mass warrant less domestic spying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, to start this off I am quite fascinated by the whole conspiracy landscape but I think most of them are dumb, and this is probably the dumbest of them all. I have a unique point of view on this subject, as my family experienced in a way, less than two generations ago, (I currently live in America, also i&#39;m 14 so I apologize for any spelling errors on mobile). Anyways, I believe I have a unique view on this because I am a native Sami, my Grandmother and Grandfather were born in Norrbotten, Sapmi. They we&#39;re in a way expelled from their land using superior economic capabilities, and acquiring the ways in some very shady ways. My Grandparents we&#39;re forced to move to a suburb of Stockholm and live like the rest of the modern Swedes, but when my Grandparents moved, they only spoke Lule of the Sami script. This caused them to experience a lot of racism from surrounding people, they ended up learning Svenska after much time, they gathered enough money to move to America, where they started a family and raised kids. What the whole point of me trying to say here is that my whole family isn&#39;t &#39;upset&#39; like these people are, my family understand that times change things change, you can always live like you did in the past. 100 years isn&#39;t that long, and having to pay taxes on land owned by the government so you can graze your cattle is in my opinion perfectly acceptable. I don&#39;t know why I included my family story as people I know will likely read this and know that I am ethnic Sami.</p>

<li><p>This was open public land that the federal government claimed as their own for various reasons</p></li>
<li><p>He was more than happy to pay fees to the BLM <strong>until</strong> they began using the funds for nefarious things such as buying the other ranchers out of their land</p></li>
<li><p>He tried to pay fees directly to the county who would (presumably) handle them in a way that is conducive to protecting his land and his way of making a living</p></li>
<li><p>When the county said they couldn&#39;t take his money, he was left with little else to do than to not pay the fees and continue on living his life.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of handling this on a local level in the courts <em>as should have been done</em>, the BLM has sent in armed federal agents to steal his cattle and auction them off to pay for the back fees due, which is costing the agency damn near 1 million dollars for fees that total 1.1 million dollars....</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Don&#39;t take this the wrong way, but you are only 14 and have little life experience.  This is the curse of being young.  I&#39;m sorry your grandparents and other family were forced off of their land, but this does not excuse our government for sending in armed thugs to try and steal a mans property, especially when the rancher has done 0 damage to the land that the BLM can quantify.  When you get older and begin to actually see the abuses of the government directly effecting you, your friends, or your family, you may begin to change your tune.</p>

<p><strong>Here is the account of the situation from one of the ranchers children, PLEASE GIVE THIS A READ</strong></p>

<p>-Mike Combs By SHIREE BUNDY COX:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I have had people ask me to explain my dad&#39;s forward stance on this BLM fight. Here it is in as simple of terms as I can explain it. There is so much to it, but here it&#39;s in a nut shell. My great grandpa bought the rights to the Bunkerville allotment back in 1887 around there. Then he sold them to my grandpa who then turned them over to my dad in 1972. These men bought and paid for their rights to the range and also built waters, fences and roads to assure the servival of their cattle, all with their own money, not with tax dollars. These rights to the land use is called preemptive rights. Some where down the line, to keep the cows from over grazing, came the bureau of land management. They were supposed to assist the ranchers in the management of their ranges while the ranchers paid a yearly allotment which was to be use to pay the wages and BLM to help with repaires and improvements of the ranches. My dad did pay his grazing fees for years to the BLM until they were no longer using his fees to help him and to improve. Instead they began using these money&#39;s against the ranchers. They bought all the rest of the ranchers in the area out with they&#39;re own grazing fees. When they offered to buy my dad out for a penence he said no thanks and then fired them because they weren&#39;t t doing their job. He quit paying the BLM but tried giving his grazing fees to the county, which they turned down. So my dad just went on running his ranch and making his own improvements with his own equipment and his own money, not taxes. In essence the BLM was managing my dad out of business. Well when buying him out didnt work, they used the indangered species card. You&#39;ve already heard about the desert tortis. Well that didnt work either, so then the threats began and the court orders, which my dad has proven to be unlawful for all these years. Now their desperate. It&#39;s come down to buying the brand inspector off and threatening the County Sheriff. Everything their doing at this point is illegal and totally against the constitution of the United States of America. Now you might be saying, &quot;how sad, but what does this have to do with me?&quot; Well, I&#39;ll tell you. They will get rid of Cliven Bundy, the last man standing on the Bunkerville allotment and then they will close all the roads so no one can ever go on it again. Next, it&#39;s Utah&#39;s turn. Mark my words, Utah is next. Then there&#39;s the issue of the cattle that are at this moment being amateur. See even if dad hasn&#39;t paid them, those cattle do belong to him. Regardless where they are they are my fathers property. His herd has been part of that range for over a hundred years, long before the BLM even exsisted. Now the Feds think they can just come in and remove them and sold them without a legal brand inspection or without my dad&#39;s signature on it. They think they can take them over two boarders, which is illegal, ask any trucker. Then they plan to take them to the Aucion Richfeild and sold them. All with our tax money. They had paid off the contract cowboys and the auction owner as well as the Nevada brand inspector with our tax dollars. See how slick they are? Well, this is it in a nut shell. Thanks&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Just because the federal gov&#39;t swoops in and lays claim to land that was at one point the property of the state/public does not make it ok for them to do what they want with those that live and work in that area</p>

<p>2) This was not a &quot;tax&quot; that he was refusing to pay.  This was a fee for services mandated by the BLM.  They are supposed to be supporting the ranchers in the area with the money they receive.  They have failed to do so, so he refuses to keep paying them.  The fact that you <strong>cannot</strong> choose where your tax dollars go is one of the many reasons taxes shouldn&#39;t be handled by the federal gov&#39;t.  They should be strictly voluntary and handled at a local and/or state level.</p>

<p>3) I realize this, I mentioned that to show that he wasn&#39;t looking for a free ride, he just wanted his money to actually go toward something that is helpful to him, not something that is trying to force him off his land.</p>

<p>4)  Shame the colonists didn&#39;t do this, could have avoided that whole pesky &quot;revolutionary war&quot; thing /s</p>

<p>5)  Perhaps, but if that were the case they would have warrants and the like, and wouldn&#39;t be tiptoeing around the seizure of his property. </p>

<p>Just because the government is &quot;right&quot; according to the written letter of the law <em>does not</em> mean you are wrong for protesting against abuses, even if those protests turn violent</p>

2) You don&#39;t get to decide where the money goes though. He had no legal right to the land.<br/>
3) Or maybe he was smart enough to know that the government is going to come in and take this back, he knew that he owed them nothing.<br/>
4) You obviously don&#39;t understand what I said. Trying to pretend that you want to pay by &#39;trying&#39; to pay it to someone he wasn&#39;t supposed to is just a genius way to gain public support without paying your &#39;fees&#39; (taxes)<br/>
5) They did... It&#39;s not wrong but you have to get people to agree with that it is abuse. I don&#39;t believe it is, and I know many people don&#39;t.</p>

<p>We should organize and tell the idiot rancher to stand down and agree to stop grazing his cattle on land he doesn&#39;t have permission to use.</p>

<p>We should also organize and tell the idiot militia to stand down and go home.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t an issue of personal sovereignty. This isn&#39;t an issue of government over-reach.</p>

<p>There is nothing defensible in the rancher&#39;s position. He and the militia with him need to stop being asshats before another tragedy occurs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mike Combs By SHIREE BUNDY COX:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I have had people ask me to explain my dad&#39;s forward stance on this BLM fight. Here it is in as simple of terms as I can explain it. There is so much to it, but here it&#39;s in a nut shell. My great grandpa bought the rights to the Bunkerville allotment back in 1887 around there. Then he sold them to my grandpa who then turned them over to my dad in 1972. These men bought and paid for their rights to the range and also built waters, fences and roads to assure the servival of their cattle, all with their own money, not with tax dollars. These rights to the land use is called preemptive rights. Some where down the line, to keep the cows from over grazing, came the bureau of land management. They were supposed to assist the ranchers in the management of their ranges while the ranchers paid a yearly allotment which was to be use to pay the wages and BLM to help with repaires and improvements of the ranches. My dad did pay his grazing fees for years to the BLM until they were no longer using his fees to help him and to improve. Instead they began using these money&#39;s against the ranchers. They bought all the rest of the ranchers in the area out with they&#39;re own grazing fees. When they offered to buy my dad out for a penence he said no thanks and then fired them because they weren&#39;t t doing their job. He quit paying the BLM but tried giving his grazing fees to the county, which they turned down. So my dad just went on running his ranch and making his own improvements with his own equipment and his own money, not taxes. In essence the BLM was managing my dad out of business. Well when buying him out didnt work, they used the indangered species card. You&#39;ve already heard about the desert tortis. Well that didnt work either, so then the threats began and the court orders, which my dad has proven to be unlawful for all these years. Now their desperate. It&#39;s come down to buying the brand inspector off and threatening the County Sheriff. Everything their doing at this point is illegal and totally against the constitution of the United States of America. Now you might be saying, &quot;how sad, but what does this have to do with me?&quot; Well, I&#39;ll tell you. They will get rid of Cliven Bundy, the last man standing on the Bunkerville allotment and then they will close all the roads so no one can ever go on it again. Next, it&#39;s Utah&#39;s turn. Mark my words, Utah is next. Then there&#39;s the issue of the cattle that are at this moment being amateur. See even if dad hasn&#39;t paid them, those cattle do belong to him. Regardless where they are they are my fathers property. His herd has been part of that range for over a hundred years, long before the BLM even exsisted. Now the Feds think they can just come in and remove them and sold them without a legal brand inspection or without my dad&#39;s signature on it. They think they can take them over two boarders, which is illegal, ask any trucker. Then they plan to take them to the Aucion Richfeild and sold them. All with our tax money. They had paid off the contract cowboys and the auction owner as well as the Nevada brand inspector with our tax dollars. See how slick they are? Well, this is it in a nut shell. Thanks&quot;</p>

<p>You have to draw the line somewhere. They will keep regulating everything if we let them, and then taxing it. The government is taking a huge over-reach, yes. These people are doing the right thing. This is a lot bigger than just some rancher not being able to use public land for his cattle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I have a feeling that he hasn&#39;t done so because the court will rule against him and require him to pay up for the past 16 years that he has illegally grazed. AFAIK, currently it&#39;s only being requested that he pay this year&#39;s grazing permit and every year from now on so long as he keeps his cattle there. Seems like a more than reasonable request.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> would be throwing a fucking fit if the oil companies in the same area were operating for the last decade without paying for their permits. And rightfully so. It&#39;d be complete bullshit. Why is it not the case for this rancher? <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is taking up the cause of what they claim to be against- a rich guy taking advantage of the government to become a richer guy.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s about his checking account. At this point he&#39;s risking his life and the life of whatever family is left in that ranch with him.</p>
