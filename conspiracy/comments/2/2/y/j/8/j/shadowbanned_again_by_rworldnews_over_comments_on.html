        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here are the comments. This is a second time in 30 days I have been shadowbanned by <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> mods. Something is up again. </p>

<p><strong>Comment 1. &quot;Ukraine officer killed and 4 others injured as Ukraine begins Anti-Terrorist operations in East Ukraine by vladislavs2in worldnews</strong></p>

<p>translation: Ukraine allows foreign mercenaries (like former Blackwater scum) to hunt Russians/Ukraininans who protests neo-nazis in Kiev. Nice.</p>

<p><strong>Comment 2. &quot;Ukraine says it can prove that Russia coordinated weekend attacks&quot; by chickenbeakphiloin worldnews</strong></p>

<p>Here is what really going on.</p>

<p>Ukraine&#39;s East is largely Russian and obviously pro-Russian. It did not happen overnight and has been historically so. The East will not tolerate nazi-run Kiev and will not obey illegitimate Kiev &quot;government&quot;. The West Ukraine has lost and Ukraine will divide, like it or not. Kiev nazi will never subdue the East Ukraine because Russian will never bow to nazis (read the history).</p>

<p>If West Ukraine is smart (which I doubt), it will allow referendum and division to East and West. The West could go and suck EU tits for as much as it wants, no one is stopping them or wanting them. They will end up like Greece, if not worse. Those who started the coup had no idea about Russian population&#39;s dynamics and strong aversion to fascism.</p>

<p><strong>Comment 3. “Would the US and western Europe really go to war to defend the territorial integrity of Estonia?…Estonia has reasons to worry. Narva…is almost completely Russian-speaking…More than 82% of Narva’s residents are ethnic Russians and 4% are ethnic Estonians. More than a third have Russian citizenship. by Syblesin worldnews</strong></p>

<p>Dear Baltic states,</p>

<p>Please stop hysteria and fear mongering. No one fucking wants you. Russia will not take your lame Narva even if you pay them. Repeat, no one fucking wants lame Baltic States, you have nothing to offer and only EU needs your little banana states. Russia does not need more mouths to feed.</p>

<p>Please stop being ridiculous and idiotic.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>The rest of the sane world.</p>

<p><strong>Comment 4. “Would the US and western Europe really go to war to defend the territorial integrity of Estonia?…Estonia has reasons to worry. Narva…is almost completely Russian-speaking…More than 82% of Narva’s residents are ethnic Russians and 4% are ethnic Estonians. More than a third have Russian citizenship. by Syblesin worldnews</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;ll bite but I doubt you will be able to understand. Baltic States have been oppressing Russians and have been on a power trip against Russians since the day one of their independence. The first thing Balts did in all 3 countries (Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia) is basically outlaw Russian language overnight (curiously, this is exactly what Ukra-nazi did too) and gave all Russians &quot;alien&quot; passports. Even Russians that were born there got &quot;&quot;alien&quot; passports and were required to pass humiliating exam, including poor seniors who cannot learn any language even if they want. Basically Russians in Baltic states have been oppressed and humiliated and frankly hated.</p>

<p>EU has a special policy about minorities that requires all EU members to &quot;“refrain from discrimination on the basis of nationality, and later on the basis of ethnic origin and minority status, rather than a positive obligation for the promotion of minority and cultural rights.” (Cengiz &amp; Hoffmann, 2013, p. 419).&quot; Yet Baltic states have been constantly oppressing Russian minorities to the point of closing Russian schools and giving fines for speaking Russian) while EU looks the other way. Curiously, when Turkey tries to join EU, EU says that Turks oppress Kurds and cite it as a reason for EU membership denial.</p>

<p>As you can see this situation clearly creates a lot of animosity and protest among Russian population because they are second class citizens. How would you like to live with &quot;alien&quot; passport even though you were born in a country? How would you like language police raiding your company and giving you fines for speaking Russian (or your native language like Spanish)? I could only imagine what would happen if language police raids landscaping and agro-companies in the US.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Shadowban miraculously canceled, so they monitor /r/ conspiracy then??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude come on. There is no reason to attack someone in such an aggressive way for being honest with you or having a differing opinion than you. </p>

<p>I agree that the Western media is shoveling pro-west shit, but guess what the Russian media is doing? Shoveling pro-Putin shit. </p>

<p>While I consider your first and second points to be plausible, Estonia may have a legitimate cause for concern if its citizens are overwhelmingly ethnic Russian and the government has been abusing their human rights. No one is a mind reader. </p>

<p>Bottom line: If you are alienating people that would likely otherwise agree with you or at least respect your positions, then you might think about approaching the debate in a less condescending fashion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just curious OP, how did you know you were banned?  Did you get a ban message?  If it was actually a shadow-ban, how did you figure that out?</p>

<p>I see a lot of people think they are &quot;shadow-banned&quot; when really what happened is their submission was removed or they got timed-out by the site for posting too quickly, etc.  The fact that you were &quot;shadow-banned&quot; <em>numerous</em> times indicates that you likely were never banned at all.  </p>

<p>Mods almost never randomly unban people.  After modmail conversation, sure, sometimes, but not out of the blue.</p>

<p>Exactly. The country will be totally pillaged by the EU &amp; IMF with their austerity measures and will end up destitute like Greece. Then poor Ukrainians will immigrate to more prosperous EU countries to find work further integrating everyone so as to undermine individual nation states and make the ultimate goal of a federalised centrally controlled Europe come about more easily. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pick any news story about Israel, the top comment is almost always positive (even if it was a story of a child getting murdered by the Israeli regime), and its almost always one of a handful of users. If its not it would be someone asking something along the lines of &quot;I wonder if this is true?/Is this the official statement?/Do we believe this?&quot; . Its quite comical.</p>

<p>Anyway - Israel doesnt deny this, <a href="http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-23695896">they admit to paying people to promote their image on social media</a>, I don&#39;t see why they wont target reddit.</p>

<p>Im not a defeatist , im being logical, if the mods on <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> control the content then we cant do much about that subreddit. We should focus our efforts on other subreddits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you on all that.  My point is that the second topmost comment, and sometimes top child of the top comment, are normally the realistic ones/against Israel (written by real people).  I find that far more are against isreel than the socks posting propaganda.</p>

<p>I know they work together, coordinate on posts.  They prep a submission, coordinate the time they&#39;re going to submit, they all upvote on the dot.  Meanwhile, they create their comment &quot;dialogs&quot;, post them and everyone upvotes them/downvotes them as needed.  They set up the tone for the comment section and define the path, and allowed breadth, for the discourse.</p>

<p>The thing that&#39;s missing from your logic is this:  You can catch them immediately after/during the post and insert comments that will run their plan/arguments off the rails.  If you do it well enough, thwarting their efforts, they will then delete the post and sometimes the comments as well.</p>

<p>Then they start the process over with the same techniques.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen this happen many times!  The thing is, all one needs to do is post links to the previously deleted, identical posts, within the new comment sections.  People then catch on and give em hell.</p>

<p>Another tip is to, when they delete their post, SUBMIT THE SAME ARTICLE YOURSELF.  You can then control the narrative, or if that fails, pull the same BS they do: delete and repost until you succeed.</p>

<p>Yes, it can be time consuming.  But, if you&#39;re passionate enough or have time to kill, you CAN make a difference.</p>
