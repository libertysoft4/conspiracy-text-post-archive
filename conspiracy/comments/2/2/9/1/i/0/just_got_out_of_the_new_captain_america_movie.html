    <div class="md"><p>In the Marvel comics world, there was an a series of issues called &quot;Civil War&quot; in which Captain America and a slew of other heroes fight against the government and a law passed that requires all superhuman&#39;s to register under their real names with the federal government, all because of a rogue group of heroes who killed a large amount of people in a small town.  This isn&#39;t necessarily the story used in the new movie, but &quot;Civil War&quot; kind of set the tone for how Captain America is viewed and written nowadays.  Not so much as a do-goody American warrior, but a person who stands up for what is right no matter the situation. </p>

<p>Yeah, if you sub the words Hydra (Nazi group that is secretly gaining control of the world) with NWO , it kinda seems very relatable. If your paying attention, they kind of elude to false flag attacks at one point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  Pay particular attention to the parts about using the masses to overthrow their own governments.  Also think about this in the context of movies like V for Vendetta and Fight Club.  Now, I have no idea if the protocols are real or not, but one really has to ask themselves why there were movies coming out of Hollywood which seemed to fit in perfectly with what the Protocols are describing.  It should also be pointed out that the executive producer, Arnon Milchan, has recently admitted to being in intelligence operative.  </p>

<p>Maybe you only watch the expendables and fast and furious movies if you actually look for say 5 no 3 seconds you can find dozens of movies that are well written with great characters and interesting stories.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prequels and sequels in excess. </p>

<p>Because they are a business. Just because something isn&#39;t a new franchise doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t have value. Is the godfather 2 worthless because it is a sequel? Or the star wars film or a whole host of films that are great despite being sequels. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For fantasy, sure.  I know I won&#39;t be watching it though.  Perhaps if it&#39;s on TV, but even then it&#39;s still unlikely.  I&#39;ve watched the quality of movies degarade over my lifetime, and I&#39;m not going to watch shitty movies because they are the only game in town.  I will vote exclusively with my wallet, which is heavily hurting Hollywood as of late.  By not rewarding shitty movie making with any of my hard earned money.  I&#39;ll pass every single time.  Far preferring to spend my free time on much nore productive and creative outlets (all while wasting some of that time here).</p>
