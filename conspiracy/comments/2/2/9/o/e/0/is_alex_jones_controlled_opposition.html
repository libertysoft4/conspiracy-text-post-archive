He clearly is mad, and his &quot;Rants&quot; are just about the weirdest things you see on the internet. BUT like somebody said here - he does wake people up to some things that are going on. 
Is the main agenda of the Zionists to wake people up to some things (just not to the shit in Israel) so that the Awakening will be somehow beneficial to the Zionists?</p>

Let&#39;s then say that some reasonable questions about evidence/lack of evidence come up (conspiracy theory), AJ will run with it, &quot;alerting&quot; his followers about it, and then he will inject all sorts of disinformation into the plot, to confuse the story, reduce the credibility of the original theory and act like a maniac the entire time, causing reasonable people to group any discussion of the theory into the lunatic fringe.  It&#39;s all just classic intelligence work.  Who is he working for?  I have no idea.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T_hQsAJdeU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T_hQsAJdeU</a></p>

<p>He is most certainly working for Ted Turner. Like many others Alex was the first place I heard about the idea that 9/11 wasn&#39;t what the govt said it was. I believe that he is using a technique similar to a frequent guest of his, David Icke.</p>

<p>They talk about real problems in the world, actual good information that people need to be aware of. They proceed to make themselves look as foolish and insane as possible, Alex with his insane ranting and shouting stuff like &quot;assemble patroits, we are under seige!&quot; and David with his absolutely absurd reptilian theories. The desired effect is to make people who discuss these important issues look like lunatics, and it is working pretty well.</p>

<p>At the same time, Infowars.com/prisonplanet.com has served to bring many well intentioned people into staging their discussion in a controlled and monitored environment. Alex himself has stated that he has had family in the CIA, and most people in that business are brought in by relatives and stay for life.</p>

<p>He&#39;s here to help muddy the waters. There is another video (don&#39;t have a link sorry) out there of him showing up at a legitimate protest. He walks into the middle of the crowd, finds some of the louder people and pulls out his bullhorn. He starts shouting crazy stuff like &quot;you don&#39;t own us&quot; and &quot;the NWO will fall&quot; that is not even related to the protest to begin with. He is confronted by some of the protestors and asked to stop, but he refuses and starts calling them shills who want to silence him.</p>

<p>Total BS beware of Alex Jones.</p>

<p>Edit: I forgot to mention another reason I believe this: Jesse Ventura&#39;s Conspiracy Theory show. Jesse Ventura used to be a pro wrestler in the WWF, owned by Ted Turner. His show is on TruTV, owned by Ted Turner. His frequent &quot;conspiracy insider&quot; guest is, you guessed it, Alex Jones. He also had David Icke on the program multiple times, the &quot;conspiracy&quot; crowd seems to be a pretty tight group as far as TruTV is concerned.</p>

<p>Second edit: I forgot to mention before, always keep in mind that this guy has been in 2 movies that I know of, A Scanner Darkly and Waking Life. A Scanner Darkly is LOADED with masonic/illuminatti symbolism, and was a major motion picture starring an A-list actor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, a small example of what he is trying to do on the large scale. I think that the reason he is the first to bring awareness about 9/11 is no accident. I originally discovered Alex on a C-SPAN special about &quot;alternative views on 9/11&quot;, not exactly an alternative news channel.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_McMahon">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_McMahon</a></p>

<p>WWF/WWE has ALWAYS been owned by Vince McMahon, a &#39;simple google search&#39; will tell you it had nothing to do with the year 2001. His shows are on USA (Monday night raw) and ScyFy for Smackdown, years ago I believe it was on UPN. Ted Turner may or may not own those channels, he undoubtedly has a hand in some if not all of those stations, but I don&#39;t think that necessarily translates to him &#39;owning&#39; the wwe by any means</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s really not insane though. CNN (Turner) has some of the biggest anti-conspiracy reporters in the business. Have you seen the famous footage where Alex literally goes nuts on Piers Morgan? By the end of the segment they both seem to completely despise each other, but then there is video on you tube of the two AFTER the segment aired and they&#39;re all buddy buddy like they didn&#39;t just have a deeply ideological disagreement minutes prior.</p>

<p>What is more indicative of the idea that Turner would start up an &quot;alternative&quot; internet based outlet like infowars can be seen in the behaviors of his former business associate Boris Berezovsky, the (deceased) Russian media tycoon. Mr Berezovsky scooped up a large number of broadcast outlets in Russia and the former USSR when they were being privatized or de-socialized.</p>

<p>A number of these started airing anti government sentiment very similar to Alex Jone&#39;s program, and in some cases actually inspired a couple of small armed insurrections that resulted in some casualties. One of these broadcasters has grown into RT, which is another outlet that delivers a lot of alternative news but is truthfully backed by big money and is not truly independent / alternative.</p>

<p>Believe what you want but i think all the evidence speaks for itself, Alex and Turner DO have real world connections, and Turner&#39;s business associates have been in the business of controlling / shaping opposition for decades now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes that&#39;s the one. They seem pretty friendly to me. What I was giving was not an analogy, that is real. Turner and the criminal Berezovsky have had many business dealings together, they are both media tycoons. Berezovsky was actively engaged in sponsoring controlled opposition, I am proposing that Turner is doing the same thing in the United States. There isn&#39;t any concrete proof that infowars is funded by Ted Turner, but do you think Alex appeared on Conspiracy Theory multiple times and wasn&#39;t paid for it? He&#39;s part of the truTv (owned by Ted Turner) conspiracy circle along with David - I see reptiles - Icke. </p>

<p>Even if infowars isn&#39;t a Turner Broadcasting outlet, Alex DID do work on a conspiracy disinfo show on a channel owned by Ted Turner, that cannot be disputed. I can&#39;t provide you with a pay stub from Turner to Jones, but come on can&#39;t you add 2 and 2 here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So that&#39;s why David Icke has been a guest on the show many times and has been in Alex Jone&#39;s films?? Also why both Alex Jones and David Icke are &quot;insiders&quot; on the Turner broadcasting show &quot;Jesse Ventura&#39;s Conspiracy Theory&quot;?? They have nothing to do with each other? I have a lot of friends who are really into Alex Jones and won&#39;t even entertain the idea that he is controlled opposition, but I&#39;m sorry to say there is more than adequate evidence of exactly what he is.</p>

<p>I know Icke is not doing the EXACT same thing as Jones, but it is very similar. David Icke provides a lot of really good information, I will give you that much, but are you suggesting you believe his reptilian theory? Even if he is right about that it still serves to make people who talk about the same issues as him look crazy to your average Joe. I am open minded and I have considered the reptilian theory, but to me it doesn&#39;t hold water and there&#39;s no proof to back it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You asked me for his &quot;left ideas.&quot; Literally every paragraph in that link is a discussion of his left ideas. For instance:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hedges stated that &quot;<strong>the inability to articulate a viable socialism has been our gravest mistake</strong>. It will ensure, if this does not soon change, a ruthless totalitarian capitalism.&quot;[4] He elaborated upon this in a 2013 interview with The Real News, claiming that &quot;the left has been destroyed, especially the radical left, quite consciously in the whole name of anti-communism,&quot; and that &quot;we have allowed ourselves to embrace an ideology which, at its core, states that all governance is about maximizing corporate profit at the expense of the citizenry. For what do we have structures of government, for what do we have institutions of state, if not to hold up all the citizenry, and especially the most vulnerable?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no doubt that Chris Hedges is a leftist. Again, it&#39;s accurate to say that he is &quot;libertarian,&quot; in the traditional sense of being an anti-authoritarian, but not in the modern American sense of also being on the right. I think the political compass is really very clear about this distinction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It might be more accurate to say that he&#39;s regulated. Imagine what he might have accomplished if he didn&#39;t come off as so bat shit crazy? Or perhaps if there were somebody more articulate in his place. It&#39;s likely that the elite seen the growth of awareness as a stable statistic, then implemented folks of Jones&#39; caliber to decrease the growth curve. Inevitably, people will know the truth, but if they understand that information in time is a whole different ball game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally woke up because of Alex Jones, and the Boston Marathon Bombings. He was the only &quot;journalist&quot; that was explaining the real events that day. It&#39;s hard to argue that he is indeed controlled opposition, meaning his show has a preplanned agenda, I think your giving too much credit to him for this.</p>

<p>I do think that there are effects of his message that are being used by the globalists to acclimate us to what&#39;s really going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones was the first source of information I found outside MSM, I admit he opened my eyes to many  things in 2011. I believe he is disinformation/misdirection, but my question is does he believe he is? He seems so passionate or at least angry about many issues. Is he a sociopath or does he believe in liberty as he says he does?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, I guess the novelty of someone talking about alternative issues  is something I used as a milepost early on. I always knew that MSM was bull, I just did not put two and two together. It just seemed like he was saying many of the right things at the time. The more I learn about him the more I feel sick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, he isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>He&#39;s <em>just</em> a radio talk show host. Remember that fact. He won&#39;t say or do or support many things because it puts him in danger or is a significant enough risk.</p>

<p>At the end of day he wants to stay on air, and support his family and business. He has like to 30-40 people working for him now.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve listened to him for 8 years now, and I believe he&#39;s overall well meaning, but highly ego driven and profit driven. Obviously, right? Which in the grand picture doesn&#39;t matter at all, there are other alt media who aren&#39;t so crazed. This is just one group doing their own thing.</p>

<p>The bigger he gets the less risks he will take, and the quality of show will diminish over time as it has been doing.</p>

<p>It has bumper music, sponsors, it has jokes, it has commercials, it has a cult of personality around it.... Its not very different from Rush Limbaugh or whoever else.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t some shortwave at midnight underground hidden revolution radio, but it certainly likes that it can create that image as it ups the entertainment value.</p>

<p>Anyway just remember its just a radio show, and one geared to entertain and maintain itself rather than to self destruct fomenting revolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes that&#39;s the one. They seem pretty friendly to me. What I was giving was not an analogy, that is real. Turner and the criminal Berezovsky have had many business dealings together, they are both media tycoons. Berezovsky was actively engaged in sponsoring controlled opposition, I am proposing that Turner is doing the same thing in the United States. There isn&#39;t any concrete proof that infowars is funded by Ted Turner, but do you think Alex appeared on Conspiracy Theory multiple times and wasn&#39;t paid for it? He&#39;s part of the truTv (owned by Ted Turner) conspiracy circle along with David - I see reptiles - Icke. </p>

<p>Even if infowars isn&#39;t a Turner Broadcasting outlet, Alex DID do work on a conspiracy disinfo show on a channel owned by Ted Turner, that cannot be disputed. I can&#39;t provide you with a pay stub from Turner to Jones, but come on can&#39;t you add 2 and 2 here?</p>
