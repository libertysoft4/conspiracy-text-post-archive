        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Music can pull emotions out of someone and even create emotion that wasn&#39;t originally there. Dark metal pulls anger from listeners and creates violent mosh pits. Techno draws a raving, frenzied, sex-driven crowd. Politically fueled music like Public Enemy made people angry and active. The Beatles sparked a revolution in the 60’s. Music promoting black power played a large part in the Civil Right Movement. Kids have to sing patriotic music in school, implanting nationalism into their heads at a young age. If you want to get a crowd riled up and ready to kill some commies, play &quot;I&#39;m proud to be an American.&quot; Music is obviously a powerful force.</p>

<p>So say I&#39;m an extremely powerful music producer. I have risen to the top and made it! I own multiple labels and radio stations. I have the power to &quot;put on&quot; any musician I want and make them famous. I hire the song writers that write their music, and the singers go along with it because they are just happy to be famous. They&#39;re just the hot public face - I&#39;m the person pulling the puppet strings.</p>

<p>Would it not make sense for large groups with a specific agenda to pay me to promote certain ideologies? A government or corporation, for instance. We already know that many famous musicians are paid to name-drop brands. What if a government needs to convince the public to go to war? What if they want to promote antisemitism? What if they want to promote homophobia or sexism or racism or rape culture? Hell, there are people so powerful that they don’t even have to pay you – they just threaten you.</p>

<p>What if they want to distract an entire generation? What if they want to prevent any music that could potentially spark another revolution like in the sixties? What if every song that the American population was exposed to was about nothing but sex, partying, and breakups, and because of that, people think that’s what is important. They forget completely about injustice and war and inequality because instead, they are waiving their hair back in forth, hair back in forth, hair back in forth?</p>

<p>Since the music industry (Top 40 radio, at least) is pretty monopolized, and most hits these days are written by the same few people, it should be easy to promote bias ideologies through top 40 lyrics. Powerful people would be stupid not to invest!</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Will music be used as another way to indoctrinate and control large populations? Is it already happening? How dangerous is this and how do we stop it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>to answer your first question, it has already happened. It is currently happening, and will continue to happen.  It can be dangerous, especially the frivolous music that serves no other purpose but to sell shit and tell girls to be brainless sluts and encourage boys to be thugs and warmongers. But it can be equally as enlightening.  I know lots of the music I have listened to in my lifetime has encouraged me to question what I know, and given me insight into my own life and the attitudes of others.  I think ultimately music can only be used as a weapon if the subject you are experimenting on is clueless to their own conditioning. Which is why a lot of music - especially the pop idgaf yolo lets fuck music is aimed directly at impressionable youth. Its to raise them with particular attitudes and ideas that make them easier to mold and steer as they develop their adult brains.  By raising the rates of degeneracy and drug use and Idgaf selfishness, its like having cattle with a ring in the nose, they can lead them wherever and into whatever mindset they want them. How do we stop it? - simple.  Parenting and talking to your kids about the world they are coming up in.  Also, checking out the local music scene - bars and festivals.  Supporting those bands and performers. Share actual good music/talented musicians with your kids, If your child comes home with justin beiber show them pink floyd. If shes got katy perry show her Janis Joplin.  In the car play some NIN - start them off right when it comes to recognizing good music and actual talent and you&#39;ll be setting them down the right path.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s less that different types of music inspire this behavior, but more that people are predisposed to this behavior gravitate toward the types of music.</p>

<p>That said it could still be a way to fine tune a message for a particular &quot;type&quot; or person, as people who like the same kind of music probably have their buttons pressed by similar types of stimuli in other ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. Many people look towards music to grab the latest idea of style and influence. When music artists and producers promote violence, sex and drugs, it seems to directly perpetuate those qualities within a society over time. When a message wants to be heard and followed music is the best messenger, for better or for worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Music is one of the largest sources of public influence in my opinion. Especially during the 90&#39;s when hip hop and r&amp;b slowly turned from creative and thought-provoking subjects to shoot-em-up, get bitches and do drugs. Rappers like Tupac, Ol&#39; Dirty Bastard and Biggie Smalls were all targeted, and easily &quot;taken care of&quot; because they tried to speak out against the force driving rap music. It has resulted in a culture that believes that the qualities spoken of in current rap are what make someone happy, ultimately profiting business rather than ideas. </p>

<p>This is just one example of how music has influenced society, and it barely scratches the surface. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that Hip Hop, especially the gangster rap, was designed to demean a mostly black culture.  It glorified a criminal low life lifestyle and encouraged a divide between men and women.  </p>

<p>But were Tupac and Biggie and other conscious rappers really truthsayers?  I don&#39;t find their message to be particularly enlightening.  That too has been part of the scam, imho.  That certain controlled musicians played the role of political musician to give us the sense of dissent without providing real dissent.  I feel the same way about John Lennon and Bob Dylan and Bob Marley and a few others.  What was their real message?  It was incredibly vague.  </p>

<p>For instance, Hip Hop could be a powerful political weapon but it was neutered.  Why haven&#39;t any black rappers focused in on the drug war?  Why not focus in on the fact that the war on drugs targeted black communities.  Instead rappers glorified the gangster attitude and seemed to revel in the fact their communities were targeted.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on some bios I read, the way the industry worked in the past was that managers would give the stars tons of free hard drugs.  The stars would lose track of where they were and how much money they were supposed to be paid.</p>

<p>Talented musicians who had the potential to speak out and get attention all died young, from drugs and/or bullets.  Hendrix (goddamit), Lennon, Cobain, etc.  Others, like Dylan and McCartney sold out and made music for money.  They survived and got filthy rich.</p>

<p>In many cases, with all of the drugs pushed at them for free, these guys built up powerful addictions and it didn&#39;t take much to push them over the edge.  It was just a matter of deciding when to push.</p>

<p>Edit:  there is no &quot;music industry&quot; nowadays.  The top 40 is songs ghostwritten for pop-tart models.  The true &quot;industry&quot; is underground, where there is little danger of anybody capturing national media attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the way stars are groomed is a lot like cult indoctrination.  Same with movie stars.  </p>

<p>They spend long hours on the set/studio usually with just a few handlers telling them what to do.  They are often separated from their family and friends and travel extensively so they are always disoriented.  They are told they are super important people . . . God like.  Their work becomes their religion and the fans reinforce this feeling.  Fans adore them and treat them like Gods.  Then of course all the drugs like you mention.</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t Quincy Jones heavily control stars like Michael Jackson?  Trying to think of other examples . . . Zappa?  </p>

<p>Also, McCartney and the Beatles spent tons of time together playing and touring and in a very controlled religious like environment.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t recommend enough. It should remove all doubt whether music is being used to control you. The 1960&#39;s hippie movement was created to get the population distracted and to tune in and drop out. </p>

<p>I particularly am intrigued about Jim Morrison. He is the son of the admiral involved in the Gulf of Tonkin incident. In addition, all the Doors songs were already written before they hit it big and Jim couldn&#39;t play any instruments and had no interest in learning. Plus he died at age 27, like so many other of the &#39;60&#39;s stars. </p>

<p>This is a lengthy read but he had written several books and grew up in the area so he is as close to an expert as I expect to find. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So looking to the <a href="http://rapgenius.com/Immortal-technique-the-cause-of-death-lyrics">lyrics</a> of &#39;The Cause of Death&#39; I note there are some things that could serve the agenda of TPTB:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You better watch what the fuck flies outta your mouth
Or I&#39;mma hijack a plane and fly it into your house
Burn your apartment with your family tied to the couch
And slit your throat so when you scream only blood comes out
I doubt that there could ever be...a more wicked MC
Cause AIDS-infected child molesters aren&#39;t sicker than me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems like he&#39;s identifying with evil and promoting terror acts, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I see the world for what it is, beyond the white and the black
The way the government downplays historical facts
Cause the United States sponsored the rise of the 3rd Reich</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay.  Now the part where he criticizes the historical facts promoted by the government.  I&#39;m down with that.</p>

<p>But the first one is false.  The U.S. didn&#39;t sponsor the rise of the 3rd Reich.  It opposed the 3rd Reich and tried to control and abuse Germany.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just like the CIA trained terrorists to the fight
Build bombs and sneak box cutters onto a flight</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, partially true.  The CIA trained terrorists.  But I don&#39;t accept that they actually sneaked box cutters onto the flight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I was a child, the Devil himself bought me a mic
But I refused the offer, &#39;cuz God sent me to strike
With skills unused like fallopian tubes on a dyke</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If he refused how is he up to the mic now?  What&#39;s his relationship to his record company I wonder.</p>

<p>Also notice the anti gay slur.  Interestingly, Hip Hop is being gayed up now, but in the previous 20 years or so it was definitely anti gay.  It would be more acceptable if Hip Hop promoted family values between husband and wife but instead lyrics like this mostly attacks gayness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My words&#39;ll expose George Bush and Bin Laden
As two separate parts of the same seven headed dragon
And you can&#39;t fathom the truth, so you don&#39;t hear me
You think Illuminati&#39;s just a fuckin&#39; conspiracy theory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep.  George Bush and Bin Liden are on the same team.  </p>

<p>But I don&#39;t like the term Illuminati as I think it obscures real elite control by focusing on one faction that was most active long ago.  Hip Hop is rife with images of Illuminati to mislead in this manner and make a joke out of the concept of elite control.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s why conservative racists are all runnin&#39; shit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nah, Democrats and liberals are working with conservatives</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And your phone is tapped by the Federal Government</p>
</blockquote>

<p>True.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So I&#39;m jammin&#39; frequencies in your brain when you speak to me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is probably a revelation of the method . . . acknowledging that he is using mind control technology . . . music (OP&#39;s original point)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Technique will rip a rapper to pieces indecently
Pack weapons illegally, because I&#39;m never hesitant
Sniper scopin&#39; a commission controllin&#39; the President</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again violent imagery and he&#39;s advocating illegal action.  Not to mention hinting at assassinating the elite that control the President.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Father, forgive them, for they don&#39;t know right from wrong
The truth will set you free, written down in this song
And the song has the Cause of Death written in code
The Word of God brought to life, that&#39;ll save ya soul
Save your soul motherfucker, save your soul</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, this is one positive section for the most part.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I hacked the Pentagon for self-incriminating evidence
Of Republican manufactured white powder pestilence
Marines Corps. flak vest, with the guns and ammo
Spittin&#39; bars like a demon stuck inside a piano
Turn a Sambo into a soldier with just one line</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again it&#39;s not just Republicans.  But agree the white powder pestilence (great line) was manufactured.  And once again he&#39;s back with the evil imagery this time describing soldiers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now here&#39;s the truth about the system that&#39;ll fuck up your mind
They gave Al Qaeda 6 billion dollars in 1989 to 1992
And now the last chapters of Revelations are comin&#39; true
And I know a lot of people find it hard to swallow this
Because subliminal bigotry makes you hate my politics
But you act like America wouldn&#39;t destroy two buildings
In a country that was sponsoring bombs dropped on our children
I was watching the Towers, and though I wasn&#39;t the closest
I saw them crumble to the Earth like they was full of explosives
And they thought nobody noticed the news report that they did
About the bombs planted on the George Washington bridge
Four non-Arabs arrested during the emergency
And then it disappeared from the news permanently
They dubbed a tape of Osama, and they said it was proof
Jealous of our freedom
I can&#39;t believe you bought that excuse
Rockin a motherfucking flag don&#39;t make you a hero
Word to Ground Zero
The devil crept into heaven
God overslept on the seventh
The New World Order was born on September eleventh</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the best part of the song so far.  Mostly accurate.  I like how he says the towers fell like it was controlled demolition.  Notice he doesn&#39;t name the Israeli identity of those arrested for the bombs on 9/11.  </p>

<p>The last verse if mostly true too:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And just so conservatives don&#39;t take it to heart
I don&#39;t think Bush did it, cause he isn&#39;t that smart
He&#39;s just a stupid puppet takin&#39; orders on his cell phone
From the same people that sabotaged Senator Wellstone
The military industry got it poppin&#39; and lockin&#39;
Looking for a way to justify the Wolfowitz Doctrine
And as a matter of fact, Rumsfeld, now that I think back
Without 9/11, you couldn&#39;t have a war in Iraq
Or a Defense budget of world conquest proportions
Kill freedom of speech and revoke the right to abortions
Tax cut extortion, a blessing to the wealthy and wicked
But you still have to answer to the Armageddon you scripted
And Dick Cheney, you fuckin&#39; leech
Tell them your plans
About building your pipelines through Afghanistan
And how Israeli troops trained the Taliban in Pakistan
You might have some house niggas fooled, but I understand
Colonialism is sponsored by corporations
That&#39;s why Halliburton gets paid to rebuild nations
Tell me the truth, I don&#39;t scare into paralysis
I know the CIA saw Bin Laden on dialysis
In &#39;98 when he was top ten for the FBI
Government ties is really why the Government lies
Read it yourself instead of asking the Government why
Cause then the cause of death will cause the propaganda to die</p>

One, simply participating with interviews with Vlad builds up the entire industry and I&quot;m very suspicious of Vlad and his role.  Two, I.T. using the word Illuminati&#39; despite its shortcomings as a description fis also tying himself to the inane usage of the word by people like Jay Z and other rappers who use it comically/ironically/as a spell.  Three, Kaballah influence is not a distraction but something worth pursuing.  I&#39;m hyper sensitive to musicians being afraid to take on Israel or negative Jewish influence and I know he does criticize Israel, etc., but this is an instance of pulling a punch.</p>

<p>I.T. may have never admitted to <em>signing on with a label</em> but he has released most of his stuff on <a href="http://whtime.cloudapp.net/tl/label/The_Viper_Label/">the Viper label</a>.  I don&#39;t know enough about it but basically I suspect most music is controlled or else it would be bought out and/or crushed. </p>

<p>As far as being <em>willing to employ evil to destroy evil</em> . . . I think this is a counterproductive tendency that weakens the opposition.  Singing a song about burning your opponent&#39;s children alive and being sicker than a child molester is not rallying the troops to confront evil . . . it&#39;s becoming evil.  </p>

When taken in the context of the source material for the music I find it hard to hold him accountable for any hyperbole or overt aggression. I stand by my original statement that I.T. is 100% sincere about what he does <em>and</em> does a pretty damned good job of navigating the matrix of deceit that envelops us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, he is correct in his critique.  But he also ends up supporting the broader Hip Hop culture and acts as a release valve.  People can point to him when others say there is no conscious message in Hip Hop.</p>

<p>He could be like a Ron Paul or Dennis Kucinich . . . speaking the truth but secretly working to keep people in a corrupt system.</p>

<p>Or maybe he is the real deal and a danger to TBTB. . . . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s absolutely possible this kind of manipulation is going on, and has been for some time.  You know TPTB took notice in the 60&#39;s of how central music was to the counter culture... apply controlled opposition technique, and blam, here we are in the present day with Keshit and Dumb Direction.   </p>

<p>I think, though, that rather than an overt message or ideology, most of the manipulation is coming from the power of omission.  If you listen to an average song on the radio these days, it&#39;s almost mind-numbingly meaningless.  I&#39;ve tried to listen to what the overall message might be, and it is truly a struggle.  </p>

<p>Such vague wordings and endless hackneyed lines, repeating the same phrases (even musically, the same chords and melodies...I&#39;ve even noticed this trend lately where every chorus is wordless, with these sort of sing-along-y faux anthem &quot;Doo doo doo dee doos&quot; in EVERY DAMN SONG).  </p>

<p>They strip the music of any potential meaning and pretty soon kids growing up listening to this shit don&#39;t even expect music to have meaning... it&#39;s <em>supposed to</em> mean nothing for them, that&#39;s normal. </p>

<p>And I think to some extent it&#39;s also true that the &quot;artists&quot; themselves are being exploited/brainwashed, similar to what happens on the listener-end of the spectrum. Because to be part of this falsely-constructed world you&#39;ve got to buy into this warped perspective on what music even is or can be. </p>

<p>Ultimately it represents a coup by the marketing/corporate sector which has replaced actual music with Pasteurized American Cheese-Music... which is a woefully inadequate Music Substitute masquerading as the real thing. </p>

<p>I just think it&#39;s so sad that an entire area of human experience is being sanitized so that whole generations are growing up not knowing that &quot;moving your soul&quot;/goosebumps experience of making/listening to music. </p>

<p>Not to mention the glaring absence of a coherent message around the themes of social/political/cultural evolution (as there had been at least partially in the 60&#39;s-90&#39;s), like OP points out.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all being reduced to a bunch of disposable singles, released by wholly manufactured corporate marketing concepts they&#39;ve taken to calling &quot;artists.&quot; (The music industry has done the equivalent of what the robber barons did in the sense that they are trying to control all aspects of the product from raw material to final product- which means they are not <em>discovering</em> bands anymore, because that takes skill and luck and is hard, but instead just making them up in a Holiday Inn Function Room somewhere in Florida...). </p>

<p>However, I think there&#39;s some hope: computers/internet are probably a hugely beneficial tool for the democratization of music, and have the theoretical potential to cut the parasitic &quot;music industry&quot; out of the picture altogether.</p>

<p>At the very least it has put into the hands of pretty much anyone, the recording tools only available to the big studios/bands of the past (which has of course good and bad ramifications...lots more noise, but also lots more quality music being produced by amateurs and individuals who have to work for a living and can&#39;t get a sweet record deal). </p>

<p>If anything, I see what is taking place as a sort of Roman Empire peak of corrupt opulence or whatever...where the old model is revealed to be flawed and is about to be replaced by a new paradigm. </p>

<p>Look at file sharing, look at streaming services for example... but also look at all those people making music anyway, just for the hell of it... and giving it away, or getting paid directly via kickstarter or something. (To quote one of my favorite semi-obscure musicians--whose argument here I&#39;m largely paraphrasing and borrowing from: &quot;When there&#39;s no beer at the party, the only people left will be there for the conversation.&quot;) That&#39;s more like what music originally was anyway, before mass media created the concept of large-scale &quot;stardom.&quot; </p>

<p>And I think that might be the overarching question in all of this: perhaps the idea of large-scale fame as it relates to music/film/tv is invalid on a fundamental level and we need to reform our understanding of what music&#39;s role is in society-- away from the corporate distribution &quot;mega stars&quot; model... and towards a more decentralized, niche-based, wider playing field where many can achieve &quot;success&quot; instead of just a few anointed puppets.</p>

<p>Because really, music used to be way more participatory on a micro-level, especially before recording, where if you wanted to hear music you had to play it yourself or employ the local musicians that were all around you... </p>

<p>I have no doubt the Jimi Hendrix of the fiddle in 1790 probably languished in obscurity in some Tavern, but he was still probably the best violinist of his time, just nobody knew it if they lived more than a few miles away.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> I agree modern popular music is likely being used conciously as a tool for social control, and a lot of it has to do with marketing/capitalism infecting the traditional music industry.  But maybe the internet can counter this by replacing the old concept of fame/popularity/distribution with a new more decentralized/democratic paradigm for how we make and relate to music. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR the first TL:DR</strong> Popular music is terrible and is probably brainwashing everyone. Decentralize, cut out the parasites, blah blah blah</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take issue with this idea that music gave voice to a coherent counter culture <em>political</em> movement in the 1960s.</p>

<p>Like we think of Bob Dylan representing some sort of political statement but like many stars it was incredibly vague.  It was nothing really to rally around.  </p>

<p>Same with John Lennon.  He was for the vague concept of &quot;peace&quot; and did oppose the Vietnam war but did so in such a weird way (like the bed-in) that it turned lots of people off.  Plus, if I recall correctly, he supported South Vietnam and didn&#39;t take the absolute position of abandoning Vietnam totally (I can&#39;t find sources on this now and am relying on recollection).  Plus, he&#39;s reputed to have turned <a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/2011/david-swindle/john-lennon%E2%80%99s-second-thoughts/">toward Reagan</a> in later years.  A lot of these elements have a designed and controlled feeling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, I have to say I disagree with you there.  While it&#39;s true that perhaps there was no single unifying organized message that 60&#39;s music was expressing... certainly there was a collective spirit of revolution and numerous examples of individual songs/bands that were very overtly political or that were instrumental in spreading the psychedelic drug culture, for example.  The anti-war songs alone could fill an anthology...very much connected in with that political movement. </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny you mention John Lennon actually, because his song <a href="http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/42614/">John Sinclair</a> is a good example of a very direct, very political song (also comes to mind: Just Gimme Some Truth heheh). </p>

<p>But further, if anything seems like it is designed and controlled propaganda, its this disinfo story you link to.  I&#39;m sorry, but the idea that John Lennon was a Reagan conservative is just absurd on its face (Not to mention, if you are implying he was somehow controlled, why the heck would he be out there making himself look like a conservative? Wouldn&#39;t that undermine the whole &quot;schtick&quot;?  On the contrary, I&#39;m pretty sure the FBI was harassing him and Nixon tried to deport him, and possibly the CIA assassinated him via Mark David Chapman)</p>

<p>Anyway, his behaviors/arguments/statements that they are supposedly basing this theory on are being seriously misinterpreted here.  I will readily acknowledge that Lennon fell out of love with the 60&#39;s hippy dippy stuff-- but this was not because he simplistically &quot;switched to the other side&quot; but instead because he was smart enough to see through BS wherever it might be lurking, and he was consistently interested in self-examination and spiritual evolution (check out the Plastic Ono Band album... painful self-examination there, brutal honesty etc.)  </p>

<p>As for his arguing etc, this is the mark of an intelligent person-- they provoke debate, they will play devil&#39;s advocate and so on.  To someone overly concerned with group-identification, -isms etc, a true freethinker will seem to defy logic to them because perhaps some of their views seem inconsistent or contrary.  It is not because they are objectively inconsistent, but they will of course appear to be that way from the perspective of someone who cannot see beyond the blind &quot;us vs. them&quot; group-think mentality.  </p>

<p>I just think that anyone who buys into the argument your article is making has a deep misunderstanding of what John Lennon was all about.  Sorry, but it&#39;s true. </p>

<p>I happen to be quite left-leaning and &quot;progressive&quot; myself, but some of my views often surprise my friends/family because they assume I am subscribing to some ideology, when in fact I try to approach each issue separately and evaluate from as neutral a standpoint as possible (some bias is of course unavoidable, but still).  Heck, I even find myself agreeing with the libertarians and people on the right on many issues (albeit for &quot;the wrong reasons&quot; probably from their perspective, but if you quoted me out of context arguing with someone, I might seem like I support some ideology that I certainly do not).  </p>

<p>In other words, just because I think Obama is a corporate shill psychopath, it doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not politically left-leaning, and it doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m gonna go vote for a republican, you know?
Bottom line is that theory is way too simplistic to be credible, IMO. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the thought provoking response.  Btw, I imagine our politics are pretty similar.</p>

<p>I guess I just think American politics and media and music is much more controlled than we imagine so I usually play devil&#39;s advocate and apply this theory to everyone . . . even icons and figures I like and may have once trusted.  I&#39;ve done a lot of research and put a lot of thought into it so I won&#39;t go into all of it here but suffice it to say I&#39;m suspicious the Beatles were controlled.  I don&#39;t know if I buy the whole Tavistock-Beatles conspiracy theory but I do think there&#39;s a good chance a lot of that is true.  Then you see a lot of synergy between other social movements and people like Tim Leary, Transcendental Meditation, The Process Church, Aldous Huxley, Esalen, etc., etc.  Hell, I can&#39;t recall off the top of my head the whole story of how Lennon met Ono and the weird connections there but that involves shady connections if memory serves.</p>

<p>Anyway, applying this cynical approach (although being open to the fact I could be wrong and too cynical) has usually paid off for me.  </p>

<p>And so little facts about Lennon&#39;s life raise red flags for me.  </p>

<p>One, Nixon naming him as an enemy and others wanting to deport him actually raises doubts about Lennon in my mind.  This type of conflict was often manufactured imho for psychological operation purposes.  It&#39;s kind of a good cop/bad cop routine where subtle agendas are often delivered unwittingly.  I think Watergate was staged for instance and that Nixon participated.  </p>

<p>As far as the music of the 60s being antiwar I guess it was anti the Vietnam war.  But this was simply admitting reality as most young people were against the war.  So this was conceded in order to co-opt music and to establish one&#39;s bona fides.  This way musicians could earn the trust of young people and then could push other subtle agendas.  And like I said, I looked a little last night and couldn&#39;t find it, but I recall Lennon not being totally against involvement in Vietnam and supporting a South Vietnamese government and basically arguing the North was evil, etc.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if the guy that worked with Lennon that claims he was a &quot;closet Republican&quot; is telling the truth or if it&#39;s disinformation.  As I say I think everything about the Beatles is basically propaganda so I assume this was too.  I also wonder if Lennon&#39;s death was staged (as I suspect JFK&#39;s and Robert Kennedy&#39;s deaths were staged).  I wonder if the Paul is Dead conspiracy stuff is true too.  But those are more out there speculations . . . </p>

<p>Just to keep it limited to OP&#39;s original point . . . the Beatles were not necessarily some band that organically popped up.  They were  promoted.  For instance, those screaming girls at the airport when they &quot;invaded&quot; America weren&#39;t they bussed in as a promotion?  The controversy about them being greater than Jesus seems like standard manufactured controversy stuff that one sees out of the modern playbook.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your response as well.   </p>

<p>I do hear what you are saying about the possibility of the Beatles being controlled and the degree to which things are controlled in general... Not so sure about the Beatles but regarding how much of the media is scripted, I&#39;d say we probably agree there. </p>

<p>I think though, that with this stuff it&#39;s the same problem I always run into with such topics...how far down could it really go?  And at what point does one&#39;s own expectation end and the reality begin in terms of that end conclusion one comes to about how many layers there really are?  I think skepticism is great and necessary, but at some point there has to be a counter balance of &quot;keeping it real,&quot; you know? Otherwise you could just keep going indefinitely... Like with all those Beatles theories, who is to say they didn&#39;t <em>want</em> you to think they were controlled, to distract from yet another even bigger conspiracy or aim?   Its like the Well if God created us, who created God?  And who created that God that created god? question...there&#39;s never a conclusion there.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m saying doubt must be tempered by reason in order to be effective at deriving the truth.</p>

<p>That said, you do make some interesting observations and I&#39;m definitely aware of the meta levels upon meta levels of propaganda that exists out there... I noticed it especially with print media... You&#39;ve got the National Inquirer to distract the truly stupid people, then standard celeb gossip, and on to infotainment and MSM news, and then ever more sophisticated types tailor-made for each increasing level of intelligence.  And individuals at each level are all confident that THEY have the real deal, because look at those morons reading People Magazine ...and so on.  Kind of comical if it wasn&#39;t so depressingly true,</p>

<p>To get back to the Beatles, I remember reading somewhere this theory that they were actually super humans or aliens of some type that were sent to Earth to usher in the next stage of evolution... Like a musical 2001 monolith.  But I mean, right there, I can&#39;t really truly believe that, but I can acknowledge that they did have an uncanny talent for songwriting.  Also, as for them being super popular, I always sort of thought of them as the first, authentic superstars...perhaps only afterwards did TPTB catch onto the potential there (I&#39;m reminded of that scene in Electric Koolaid Acid test when they go to the Beatles concert and the crowd seems like a giant amoeba hah)...which still leaves open your possibility of cooption. </p>

<p>I hear you man.  I&#39;m trying to be as rational as possible and I try to verify all my facts and think independently.  I&#39;m not interested in being led astray and I try to stay humble and remember I could be wrong but I have recently begun to accept these conspiracies are grander than I first imagined.</p>

<p>I agree about the meta upon meta stuff.  You&#39;re absolutely right the Beatles could want us to think they are controlled.  Maybe that actually explains the Paul is Dead conspiracies . . . it was always simply a hoax or PR campaign to get us to think they were engaging in a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Re the National Inquirer . . . it may work to distract truly stupid people but it&#39;s also a place were truth might be slipped in so as to confuse us and to discredit the truth.  For instance, Mary Meyer, the ex-husband of Cord Meyer who was a big wig in the CIA and ran the Mockingbird Operation helping to control U.S. media was alleged to be the girlfriend of JFK.  This was <a href="http://letsrollforums.com/showpost.php?p=219553&amp;amp;postcount=181">first revealed in the National Inquirer</a> in the mid 1970s.  It was later confirmed (pretty much) by Timothy Leary in his autobiography in the early 1980s where he claims he was turning Mary on to LSD in the early 1960s and she was turning on powerful men in D.C. (hinting at JFK).  Leary also claims that Mary called him shortly after the JFK assassination and told him that they murdered JFK because he was basically becoming too independent.  Anyway, I don&#39;t know if alleged renegade CIA agent James Truitt was telling the truth to the National Inquirer in the 1970s, or if Leary was telling the truth in his autobiography (I guess no on both accounts actually), but your point about the levels of deceit applies to the National Inquirer as well.</p>

<p>And yes, I too draw the line at the Beatles being other worldly . . . but I do think it&#39;s highly possible they were engaging in mass hypnosis or somehow trying to influence society.  They do seem to have had a fixation on Aleister Crowley who flirted with occult beliefs like this.  The Electric Koolaid Acid tests and the Merry Band of Pranksters were definitely connected to the music of the Beatles and there was snyergy between these things.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an interesting review of the book focusing on the idea of controlling the masses:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kesey&#39;s experience with the Beatles begins with a continuation of his desire to &quot;control&quot; things, but ends up as something completely different. The power to control people and make them bend to his wishes that he found at the Unitarian camp has infected him in some way. He believes that by simply hanging a sign welcoming the Beatles, he will entice them to come to La Honda and be in The Movie. The great acid trip that they all have on the bus on the way to the concert symbolizes their belief in this power to transcend the normal world and to connect with anybody they want to, bringing those people into The Movie, as well.</p>

<p>When they arrive at the concert, however, they are greeted by a throng of screaming people. For once, the Pranksters don&#39;t stand out. They aren&#39;t special, and they aren&#39;t the center of attention. Even with their Day-Glo costumes and drug-addled behavior, they don&#39;t mean anything in the larger scheme of the Beatles craze. As Kesey watches the Beatles on stage, he can see that they exert a different kind of control over the crowd. Kesey sees that the crowd is just one big teeming mass of hysteria that bends to the will of the Beatles, and he knows that he himself does not possess such power. After World War II, &quot;crowd-psychology&quot; became a minor discipline in the field of psychology and caught on with some famous and semi-famous artists and intellectuals. </p>
