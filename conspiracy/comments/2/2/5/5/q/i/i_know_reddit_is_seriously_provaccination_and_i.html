The fact that they prevent or rid certain diseases may be true, but why couldn&#39;t it also be a practice in controlling the populace? There is evidence of vaccines linking to certain sicknesses, and as we all know the connection between vaccines and autism has been burned to the ground. Suppose this was an argument distract and dissuade people from the actual reason for vaccines.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that the original creator of vaccines had good intentions, but put into the wrong hands, anything can be manipulated for worse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are some excellent resources, to cut a long story short vaccines are an attempt to induce highly profitable autoimmune diseases and allergies, these are lifelong complications which leave the victim dependent on drugs for life, that means serious money for the pharmaceuticals.  You are no use to them if you are healthy, they need you to have symptoms, symptoms which require treatment.</p>

<p>How do they get away with this?  It&#39;s mainly through incredibly poor so-called &#39;Vaccine Safety&#39; studies; they do not use real controls in their studies, only other vaccines i.e. no saline solutions to compare against, their idea of a control is another vaccine with Aluminum, Formaldehyde, Aborted Fetus etc, but just without the Virus.  This is clearly junk science, then the &#39;Safety Study&#39; goes on for at most a few days, yet autoimmune diseases from vaccines can take 2 months, 6 months or even 2 years to appear after a vaccine.  So, that&#39;s how they get them through &#39;testing&#39;.  The next part of the scam is not tracking vaccine damage, they make almost no effort to track the harm the vaccines are doing, it&#39;s just voluntary reporting, and given how long vaccines take to cause disease very few will deduce that the vaccine caused their illness.  It&#39;s estimated that at most 5% of vaccine damage is reported, but already $Billions have been paid out in compensation.</p>

<p>Reddit is not really so pro-vaccine as you might think, it&#39;s just full of sock-puppets who make it appear that way.</p>

<p>Now for the studies/resources/info:-</p>

<p><strong>The more vaccines a first world nation give to their children, the worse the infant mortality rate.</strong>
<strong>Infant mortality rates regressed against number of vaccine doses routinely given: Is there a biochemical or synergistic toxicity?...&quot;These findings demonstrate a counter-intuitive relationship: nations that require more vaccine doses tend to have higher infant mortality rates.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;Systemic autoimmunity appears to be the inevitable consequence of over-stimulating the host&#39;s immune ‘system’ by repeated immunization with antigen, to the levels that surpass system&#39;s self-organized criticality.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;it is the steady accumulation of evidence, from a number of respected universities, teaching hospitals and laboratories around the world, that matters here. There&#39;s far too much to ignore. Yet government health authorities are, it seems, more than happy to do so.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>...</p>

<p><strong>&quot;the refusal by governments to evaluate the risks properly will make this one of the greatest scandals in medical history&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;There are very powerful people in positions of great authority in Britain and elsewhere who have staked their reputations and careers on the safety of MMR and they are willing to do almost anything to protect themselves.&quot;</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It tends to be that a specific drug company will sell a vaccine that regularly causes a specific complication, and of course they sell the drug to treat that complication.  So like you say it&#39;s not essential that all the drug companies have got together on this, any individual drug company can use this tactic i.e. they sell you the problem and then the long-term solution.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example of Bayer doing exactly this, they even admit so in their own documents, people went to jail for this in some countries.  They sent out products contaminated with HIV to increase the sales of their HIV drugs, it was an injectable blood-clotting medicine used by hemophiliacs. </p>

<p>PS The shills will always try a cheap shot on that and say &quot;It wasn&#39;t a vaccine&quot;, well it wasn&#39;t a vaccine on that occasion, but it&#39;s the same business strategy at work of sending out contaminated injections.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The basic way to look for the truth about vaccines is to look into the reputations of the corporations who make them; these are criminal corporations who are regularly fined huge sums of money for knowingly putting dangerous products on the market.  With vaccines they have a conflict of interest, as they profit directly from vaccine damage; they sell you drugs to treat the symptoms which their vaccines induced.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a cruel yet brilliant idea.  If there&#39;s a medical technology that is keeping Americans healthy and safe, if via propaganda you can make them willingly refuse, thereby sickening themselves and the rest of the population, an adversary can inflict major damage on us without every actually being present -- just transmitting bullshit ideas that the sheeple eat up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes yes, I&#39;ve just posted it all above, lots there.  I was once pro-vaccine, I used to believe in them all, now over years of intense study I&#39;ve knocked them off one by one, I still believed certain vaccines even a number of years back, but now I&#39;ve read too much, the whole thing is a scam I&#39;m sorry to say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is only one and it is only when given in the Third World, it&#39;s the single Measles vaccine (not the triple shot MMR) when given in the malnourished Third World, this actually does genuinely improve infant mortality rates.  This shows that if vaccines were in the right hands and used with sound logic instead of &quot;Let&#39;s profit from spreading disease&quot; then there could at least be some good that would come from them.  Unfortunately they&#39;re currently in the hands of criminals and are being abused.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wonderful, thank you so much for the info and your time.
If you haven&#39;t posted about these studies before, or in a while, you should. There&#39;s a lot of great counter arguments for those that may want to see them.</p>
