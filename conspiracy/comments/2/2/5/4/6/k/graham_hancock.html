        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been a hardcore skeptic with interest in conspiracy theories for a long time, and I just discovered Graham Hancock.</p>

<p>The guy is an archeologist/journalist/historian/philosopher, and he has blown my mind since I discovered him.</p>

<p>One of his primary hypotheses is that there was an ancient global civilization which was almost totally wiped out by the great floods ~10,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age.  As a student of history with an interest in ancient history, this theory makes the world a much more sound and sensible place.</p>

<p>Rather than writing a novel in this title post, I&#39;ll urge you all to google &quot;Graham Hancock&quot; if are not yet familiar with him, and hear what he has to say about our world.  If nothing else, he is an example of an outside thinker who has been systematically ridiculed and discredited unfairly by those who hate his ideas.</p>

If you look at all of their work 1st, William &quot;Bill&quot; Milton Cooper will connect the remaining dots for you. If your not afraid if the word God, Chuck Missler has great work too.

<p>What I like about Graham is his scientific integrity.  He never makes claims which are false.  His theories come from evidence, and the holes he pokes in the existing &#39;story of civilization&#39; are gaping.  As a student of history, I have the utmost respect for Graham as a historian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Icke is far removed from the others, as they are from eachother. To learn, you need to be able to heat everything and not believe a word of any of it. If you pick and choose the info, disregard something because of personal opinion on source, or believe a word of what you hear from anybody, and you&#39;ll surely miss something important. My recommendation is that you hear everything, from everybody, good bad or indifferent, and let yourself see the truth that fits your world best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no &quot;belief&quot; involved here my friend. Hearing all without bias is a simple necessity when seeking information. It is the same concept as a jury. If the jury were to say &quot;don&#39;t hear him because he represents the defendant&quot;, then there is unarguably a lack of proper investigation. And to point at one man and say &quot;if you don&#39;t like him you won&#39;t like the rest&quot; is nothing short of a closed mind. I mean in no way to offend, but this ought to be regarded as common methodology when dealing with any kind of research. Love and Light ;-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. I&#39;ve obviously miscommunicated my point, or you&#39;re hearing about it wrong. Why focus on star child? What part does that topic have to play in this discussion? If what you&#39;re doing is attempting to disprove the wealth of scientific research across dozens of topics by Lloyd Pye by calling on a single piece of information, you only further illustrate the point I&#39;m trying to make. You hear star child and your belief is that upon hearing the info, you are required to either believe or not believe. Throw belief in the garbage my friend. Just hear. Nothing is irrelevant, and nothing is the answer to that which you seek. Please, I&#39;ve stated a very reasonable reccomendation regarding research and study. I meant in no way to specifically call upon you and you alone to take a defensive stance against my words. Love and light. ;-)</p>
