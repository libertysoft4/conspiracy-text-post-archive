    <div class="md"><p>Sure, I&#39;ll bite. It is pretty basic once you get it. Not proof, but a less-traditional explanation: </p>

<p>The earth and atmosphere have historically gone through longterm cycles. Important elements - carbon, nitrogen, oxygen - also go through cycles. The location and amount of carbon at different stages of this cycle, like carbon in the air, or in plants and animals, or deep in the earth, is well-regulated by the earth. </p>

<p>Now, humans have come along and found ancient pre-human carbon deep in the earth. Stuff that took a very very long time to get there. According the way earth has handled shit for 4.5 billion years, that carbon should continue to go down, deeper into the earth, until tectonic plate movements turn it into magma. Then the carbon can go back to the atmosphere through a volcanic eruption. </p>

<p>Instead, we&#39;ve decided to dig up the fossil fuel, burn it, and dump it into the atmosphere. Humans have done in 100 years what takes the earth much much longer. </p>

<p>According to historical &quot;climate change&quot; and natural cycles, the earth is due for a cooling period. However, observation shows the earth is warming. Therefore, human-caused warming due to dumping carbon in the atmosphere is very real. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok I will give you a simple summary I could go into far more detail but you don&#39;t really need that to understand the basics. </p>

<p>Ok the basic theory is that all the gasses in the atmosphere absorb heat and do so in varying amounts. Gases that absorb more heat than normal air are called greenhouse gases. The most common greenhouse gas that we pollute the air with is CO2 carbon dioxide but there are other gases such as methane. As we pollute more greenhouse gases the atmosphere beings to absorb more heat, which starts to heat up the planet. </p>

<p>I can elaborate further if you want there is a lot more I can talk about and prove plenty of evidence to back up all my claims. </p>

<p>In terms of are we having an effect on the environment the only answer is yes. The question is to what degree.  </p>

<p>What do you mean? There is no conclusive proof that CO2 absorbs more heat than regular air? I can point you to plenty of links that explain that it does. Or if you really want you can see the results of an experiment that I did that proves it as well.</p>

<p>These graphs should also help. <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Global_Temperature_Anomaly.svg">Global Land–Ocean Temperature Index</a> Rise in temp occurs at the same time as increased carbon in line with past trends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now we talking about something I am an expert on, and that is simply not correct. </p>

<p>What is being proposed and what is being packaged are very different. A carbon tax is not a tax on polluters any more than sales tax is a tax on retailers. It is a tax on consumers. </p>

<p>We all want to do the right thing in life. And I for one am not going to argue that a 150 year old technology hodgepodge of the combustion engine oil and coal are preferable to solar or wind, but make no mistake about it, the world is not going off oil and coal one day to the next. </p>

<p>A carbon tax will be the biggest transfer of wealth in the history of humanity, and there is no exaggeration there. The winners will be the corporations, and the losers will be the consumers, especially the poorest people in the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I won&#39;t argue about the details of one way of dealing with the issue. A carbon tax is one way of helping, It isn&#39;t the only way of dealing with this and it isn&#39;t even the best way of doing it in terms of a tax on levels of pollution. An ETS is a much better way of operating.</p>

<p>Earlier you were denying the problem entirely now it will make the big polluters, the people we are trying to change the ways of the winners? Well they will be when they are the ones to change and their competition lags behind. With an ETS companies like tesla will be the winners not fucking Chrysler.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. The government profits more from oil then the oil companies in the form of taxes and regulations. The whole &quot;carbon credit&quot; idea is a scam, pay for <em>poulition</em>? What benefit is it to the environment that some government is collecting payments to allow companies to release carbon? The whole concept is to make it so small companies can no longer afford to operate and have to sell out to larger corporations where the same people that are pushing for these &quot;climate change&quot; regulations have investments. Guess who makes out like a bandit?</p>

<p>It makes sense if you actually think about it. You cap the amount of pollution that a company can emit. If they go over they either have to pay the government or they can buy cap space off a greener company that has room. Small green businesses actually benefit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly of all go and actually look at the evidence and tell me that the problem is mythical or I could explain it for you if you want me to. </p>

<p>A simple explanation of one aspect of climate change is this: Carbon Dioxide absorbs more heat and normal air as we release more CO2 into the atmosphere more heat is absorbed in the atmosphere and the planets temperature increases. The huge emissions of Carbon by humans is not causing the cycle itself, it is speeding it up. </p>

<p>Secondly you don&#39;t seem to understand the point of the cap. It creates a monetary (you know dollars? what our economies are based on)  incentive to business who don&#39;t pollute and punishes those who pollute high amounts. It&#39;s like creating a limit on how much garbage can be collected from a house, if that house exceeds the limit they have to buy garbage space off their neighbours. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted this as a reply in this thread, commenting so OP and others can see it too. Climate change is very real. Don&#39;t think that just because people use climate change for political gain, or the enviro-pollution scare tactic for control and power, that the fundamental reality is false. </p>

<p>The earth and atmosphere have historically gone through longterm cycles. Important elements - carbon, nitrogen, oxygen - also go through cycles. The location and amount of carbon at different stages of this cycle, like carbon in the air, or in plants and animals, or deep in the earth, is well-regulated by the earth. </p>

<p>Now, humans have come along and found ancient pre-human carbon deep in the earth. Stuff that took a very very long time to get there. According the way earth has handled shit for 4.5 billion years, that carbon should continue to go down, deeper into the earth, until tectonic plate movements turn it into magma. Then the carbon can go back to the atmosphere through a volcanic eruption. </p>

<p>Instead, we&#39;ve decided to dig up the fossil fuel, burn it, and dump it into the atmosphere. Humans have done in 100 years what takes the earth much much longer. </p>

<p>According to historical &quot;climate change&quot; and natural cycles, the earth is due for a cooling period. However, observation shows the earth is warming. Therefore, human-caused warming due to dumping carbon in the atmosphere is very real. </p>

<p>It really is basic shit, doesn&#39;t need 9000 pages or hard science to illustrate that we&#39;re fucking this shit up. But in exchange, we get big buildings and fresh fruit shipped across the world now, and all the problems in the future. Not a bad deal if I&#39;m just gonna die.  </p>
