<p>I did some searching around this morning after I saw this abhorrent excuse for satire posted in our fanclub. The article is essentially an outright hit piece on the 9/11 truth movement. Yes, I realize it&#39;s a &quot;joke&quot; and some people are easy targets for laughs. However, this particular piece doesn&#39;t even bother with comedic niceties, it goes straight for the throat. People are welcome to their satire, but denying the truth about 9/11 is plain and simple status quo mentality. It isn&#39;t edgy. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/911-truther-vows-not-to-rest-until-everyone-knows,35319/?utm_source=Facebook&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=LinkPreview:N">Here is the article in question</a> </p>

<p>A quick search of <a href="http://www.theonion.com/search/?q=9%2F11">9/11 on The Onion</a> revealed that there have been dozens of 9/11 related &quot;jokes&quot; on the site. The jokes are becoming more and more brazen every year and many of them seem to disparage the conspiracy crowd outright and reinforce, albeit through comedy, that the official narrative stands as truth.  </p>

<p>A little bit of sleuthing lead me to discover that The Onion was in fact <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2005/0131/071.html">sold by it&#39;s original Madison, Wisconsin owners to new owners in New York back in...wait for it... 2001.</a></p>

<p>The new owner of The Onion is New York money manager David Schafer and his cohorts. </p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">28</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/SkepticalFaceless.html">SkepticalFaceless</a> 2014-12-17</p>
    <div class="md"><p>This article is pretty spot on. Those that begin to go &quot;down the rabbit hole&quot; seem panicked that no one else understands these things. With the new-found &quot;truth&quot; (new conspiracy-interested people are the most gullible), they go around to their friends and spouses trying to convince them on the same thing.</p>

<p>Problem is, by this point most theorists are so wound up and expecting imminent doom (since you see, none of this &#39;doom&#39; was around when I was &#39;asleep&#39;), that they don&#39;t have the patience or tact necessary to convince people.</p>

<p>The onion, seeing this trend, simply lampoons it like the Onion does. This does not support the status quo (at least not in a rothschild top-down kind of way) and the Onion has taken conspiracy-minded articles from the other side many many times.</p>

<p>If &quot;we&quot; are getting butthurt, its because we are acting like ass holes to others when sharing information. Turns out, challenging people&#39;s perspectives is a skill, just like debating and convincing others.</p>

<p>Turns out most theorists spend their time on the internet researching theories instead of learning how to interact meaningfully with others. I was once one of these people as well.</p>

<p>Now, I keep my fucking mouth shut until I&#39;m fairly comfortable and have enough evidence to begin saying things, and then ask questions to my peers challenging their assumptions. When they run out of info, I simply provide more info from my side of the table. Keep doing this tactfully long enough, and you begin to shift their perceptions.</p>

<p>That said, theorists do what is said in the article all the time, and I myself am guilty of it. Nothing to see here, move along, stop getting butt hurt and find more effective ways of spreading questions/knowledge/perspectives.</p>

<p>edit: a word</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kind of reminds me about what Penn from P&amp;T says about christians who prostheletize.</p>

<p>They honestly believe that you are going to spend an eternity in hell, do you really blame them for trying to help you? They&#39;d do the same if they saw you walking down the train tracks and a train was coming.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same with conspiracy theory. If you really believe that a criminal entity controls vital parts of your government, isn&#39;t it your duty to spread the word and try to make people aware?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah , but i get the point that a lot of conspiracy enthusiasts have the same lack of understanding of conversational context i.e linking every conversation to conspiracies because they have some inside knowledge or think they do.

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes its relevant though.  I&#39;m in Odessa and yesterday I was speaking to an old man who is pushing astrology while showing me his Internet wife prospects and the subject came up about politics of Russia and Ukraine.  In this moment it was relevant to mention that a group of atheistic Jews seized control of Russia back in the Bolshevik days and that Russia was a major victim of this as well as Ukraine.  It does come up but in the meantime its best not to be just working that non-stop.  Especially when it comes to women that I want to sleep with it is best to really not say too much.  Usually speaking about intellectual topics will end up alienating them and what they really want is relationship oriented talk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. It&#39;s not irrelevant that they are jewish. In the same way I wouldn&#39;t take the religious moniker out of christian fundamentalists or islamic extremists.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a difference between being annoying and being an asshole. The former occurs through a lack of awareness and social skills, the latter is deliberate malicious intent. The article is suggesting 9/11 Truthers are so in love with promoting their theories that they don&#39;t care who they hurt in the process of evangelizing it. To question 9/11 makes you an &quot;asshole&quot; and an &quot;absolute prick&quot; because, you know, 3,000 innocent people died that day so <em>how dare you</em> disrespect them by spreading obvious LIES you fucking asshole!</p>

<p>God what a joke that person is, what would his mother think turning that tragedy into some sick, twisted fantasy about conspiracies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is also true of popular comedy website Cracked, one that I&#39;ve been reading for years. I&#39;ve noticed over the past 12 months or so a major increase in joke material regarding the Truth movement and making fun of conspiracies.  </p>

<p>Honestly I think it&#39;s becoming a &quot;thing&quot; now to make fun of conspiracies. It&#39;s a modern punch line.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m only hoping that at least it gets people curious and puts the ideas in their heads, even though they are exposed to it through satire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a difference between being annoying and being an asshole. The former occurs through a lack of awareness and social skills, the latter is deliberate malicious intent. The article is suggesting 9/11 Truthers are so in love with promoting their theories that they don&#39;t care who they hurt in the process of evangelizing it. To question 9/11 makes you an &quot;asshole&quot; and an &quot;absolute prick&quot; because, you know, 3,000 innocent people died that day so <em>how dare you</em> disrespect them by spreading obvious LIES you fucking asshole!</p>

<p>God what a joke that person is, what would his mother think turning that tragedy into some sick, twisted fantasy about conspiracies.</p>

<p>That article&#39;s fucked and if that&#39;s the level of &quot;humor&quot; of The Onion these days they can fuck right off for starters.</p>
