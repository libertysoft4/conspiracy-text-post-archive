    <div class="md"><p>Hello Psynnn --</p>

<p>I would invite you to use common sense.</p>

<p>The Boston Marathon Bombing was really a hoax. </p>

<p>It was a farce of grotesque proportions and highly treasonous. </p>

<p>All of the amputations were fake.</p>

<p>Crisis actors were used. </p>

<p>But I would not expect your typical American to be onto such corruption. Go ahead and keep trusting your leaders.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll be fine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I represent only myself, but I can not believe in any theory at all. It is not about believe systems when you have a scientific approach. And theories are a scientific approach, some steps ahead of collecting scientific knowledge on a certain matter. With other words believes and knowledge do not mix together well. Believes are subjective and do not help in objective reasoning.</p>

<p>Some theories have higher probability and you may say that those with higher probability, less contradicting evidence and the ones that have been tested after years of research are considered more useful to understand the world we are living in than others. But which ones somebody considers useful may be different from individual to individual.</p>

<p>For sure there are some absurd theories that have no real value to be repeated and are considered to be unreliable. For instance the flat world theory and the official 9/11 conspiracy theory about Osama and his 19 hijackers.</p>

<p>No shit.  Doesn&#39;t change the fact that 27 bullets were fired and 26 of them were kill shots.  Not 26 or 27 bullets <em>hit their targets</em>, 26 of 27 bullets <em>were killshots</em>.  This is a huge and important distinction and <em>does</em> suggest &quot;clinical&quot; accuracy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>then how can this many people be in on it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How many people would actually need to be in on it?  50?  100?  And this question is irrelevant anyway, we don&#39;t need to have an answer to it in order to notice the numerous and obvious problems with the official story and the apparent cover-up that&#39;s followed.</p>

<p>My whole point, which you obviously missed either out of ignorance or arrogance was that if you make a claim <em>you</em> should be the one to back it up.</p>

<p>And did you even read your link?  It says nothing about how many shots were fired...which is what the original claim was.  What your link does show is that while Sandy Hook was an outlier, it is still possible to kill that many and only wounding a few.  You can&#39;t dismiss an outlier <em>simply because it is an outlier</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe that there are large lizard humanoids living beneath the earth, eating our children and controlling our entire species by shape shifting into our skin and placing themselves in high government positions. </p>

<p>Another theory I don&#39;t believe is the Hollow Earth, the theory states there is no core and there is infact an entire unexplored &quot;world&quot; within our earth. Where aliens and humans co-exist (also mammoths apparently). There are said to be many entrances to this inner earth, the ones I remember are located at the Poles. It is a very fascinating theory though and if you have time to kill, give it a google.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some people are 100% sure these things are real, I believe reptilians are covered massively by David Icke. I&#39;m pretty new to the whole conspiracy game really. Just dropped in after 9/11, it just seemed to coincidental that the US gained the perfect excuse to invade yet enough country full of resources. Anyways, not to stray from my point. Some people feel so strongly about these theories that they have dedicated their lives to getting the word out. Yes, they are absurd. However I don&#39;t think people like David spread the word because they think that they&#39;re a neat &quot;story to tell&quot;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the hollow earth one.  I am not big on many ideas but this one sparks my curiosity.  I like to imagine that life in the hollow world would actually show people upside down from us.  If the core itself is like a sun then the people, lakes, mountains etc are the under skin of ourselfs above.  Its an interesting idea which makes me think that gravity has some kind of line where those above and those below utilize and that gravity does not become stronger closer at the core.  Fun stuff. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was 15, I read some books by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Besides Tarzan and John Carter of Mars, he wrote about an inner Earth realm called Pellucidar. </p>

<p>Brave adventurer finds his way in by accident, meets up with primitive people and has all kinds of adventures. Classic Burroughs stuff. I&#39;m pretty sure that his books and the theories about this are based on a book from the 1800&#39;s called The Coming Race. It predates the other stories and refers to some sort of underground/inner Earth realm.</p>
