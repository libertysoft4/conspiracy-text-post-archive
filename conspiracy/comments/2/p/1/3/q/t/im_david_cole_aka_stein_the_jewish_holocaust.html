    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit...I feel the same way.</p>

<p>What the fuck?  I really thought David Cole for a moment might have actually been someone that could be listened to....Then this shit?  Wow.  Like...<em>right out of the blocks</em> the dude shows himself to be just as much a part of the problem.</p>

<p>Damn.</p>

<p>Came here hoping to find some cool/interesting David Cole information...left here very disappointed.</p>

<p>Well, I guess finding out that the dude is actually this much of a shill is very informative in itself, so...</p>

<p>EDIT:  Having read through pretty much all his responses, I will amend my previous vitriol a touch and say that Cole mentions that he is a Zionist, but feels that EVERYONE should have their own land.  That tempers me only a <em>little</em> bit, however, because this doesn&#39;t do away with the fact that Zionist Jews in Israel are being amongst the worst types of racists around, and it needs to stop in no uncertain terms.</p>

<p>Okay.  &quot;Zionist&quot; in itself means that it&#39;s a person who supports the existence of the state of Israel.</p>

<p>That in and of itself is not necessarily a bad thing.  However, it needs to be found out if any supporter of the existence of the state of Israel ALSO happens to support the genocidal acts that they have been responsible for perpetrating upon the Palestinian population.  One thing is not <em>necessarily</em> equal to and the same as the other.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s a Zionist that happens to absolutely hate and abhor what Nettanyahu (or however tf you spell that motherfucker&#39;s name) is doing there and feels that it SHOULDN&#39;T be happening, then I wouldn&#39;t say that that&#39;s a horrible thing.</p>

<p>However, you also have to wonder about what these types of Zionists think about exactly HOW Israel got formed in the first place.  What do they feel about the fact that Israel is illegal? and got formed through The Balfour Declaration, which was essentially a treaty that got England to basically <em>steal</em> the land from the Palestinians in the first place?</p>

<p>What do Zionists feel about that?  If it&#39;s a Zionist that says &quot;Look.  I feel that Jews SHOULD have their own land, but I think that it shouldn&#39;t be Israel because we got that land ILLEGALLY <em>and</em> on top of that, a lot of Jews there are fucking killing and torturing and being racists to the Palestinians, and I VERY much don&#39;t agree with that!&quot; then hell...that&#39;s a Zionist that I could actually agree with and get behind.</p>

<p>However - and this is a big ass &quot;however&quot; - how many Zionists have EVER actually felt this way or expressed any sentiments even <em>similar</em> to this?</p>

<p>None, you say?  Yeah.  I say that too.</p>

<p>All names and labels and categories aside, I think that anyone who agrees with and supports racism and violence and death and apartheid is...my enemy.  Flat out.  Simple as that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They&#39;re not remotely racist either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I knew this Jewish family many years ago, and they really were SUUUUPER nice.  I liked them very much.  One of the girls - who was the first person I met in the family and who I have INCREDIBLY good and positive memories of - took various trips to Israel and, presumably, supports her people and Israel itself quite a bit.  I haven&#39;t talked to them in MAAAANY years, and all of this was before I actually knew anything whatsoever about Zionist racism and apartheid, but all I remember of them is that they were really suuuuper nice.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if either the entire family (who was pretty well off, btw) - or at least the children in particular - didn&#39;t know much about Zionist apartheid either...but I also wonder if their point of view/perspective - especially on the issue of Israel and its existence - turned a blind eye to what is happening to the Palestinians.</p>

<p>That WOULDN&#39;T be good...and my point here is that, even a family as beautiful and wonderful and kind as that family seemed, if they were <em>that</em> kind, but they ALSO happened to support and agree with what Israel is doing to the Palestinians or conveniently turn a blind eye to it?</p>

<p>Then <em>fuck them</em>.  That shit is unforgivable as far as I&#39;m concerned, and even these people who I still think about as beautiful and nice...are my enemy as well.  That shit is just <em>not.  Right.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think it&#39;s such a loaded term that some folks shut down after hearing it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It definitely is a loaded term, but I think it&#39;s loaded because - very similar to what I just explained above - although I&#39;m sure there are some nice/good people who are Jews who also support the existence of Israel, I KNOW there are many Jews and Zionists who support all the horror that&#39;s being inflicted upon the Palestinians...and so long as anyone does THAT and supports <em>that</em>, then I think they are part of the problem - whether they are a &quot;nice&quot; Zionist or not.  If they support Israel and what Israel is doing then they are in the wrong in my book.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In his book, he only briefly mentions the Zionism thing, and in one sentence says he doesn&#39;t have time for 9/11 conspiracies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But...you don&#39;t find that...pretty fucked up, ax?  I mean come on.  You&#39;re smart.  I know you <em>have</em> to know that Cole himself has to know just how implicated Israel is in 911...and to conveniently ignore just how completely damning it is for Zionism and Israel to have been as involved in 911 as he most definitely seems to be doing is...is cowardly on Coles part.</p>

<p>I <em>know</em> you see that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The guy chooses his battles. He was a conspiracy theorist, almost was killed, and decided to never look back.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough, but it&#39;s just...odd to dedicate so much of your life to ONE aspect of heinous Zionist chicanery (holocaust lies), yet completely, actively ignore another area of it that is possibly even MORE damning still (direct Zionist involvement responsible for the 3K American murders on 9/11/01 and the millions of American and mid-east citizen deaths that have happened in the wars of aggression that have happened as a result since then).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He was partying in the 2000&#39;s with the Hollywood elite, not researching 9/11 conspiracies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay.  However, that was then.  That was a long time ago.  He&#39;s had quite a bit of time to come face to face with some of the shit that&#39;s going on and that Zionism seems very much responsible for.  I <em>know</em> he&#39;s aware of it.</p>

<p>And...for that matter, if he wasn&#39;t researching 9/11 conspiracies in that time, I&#39;d say it was because he was conveniently ignoring their factual existence - which you have to think that he definitely knew about, since he definitely is as aware as he is about the lies that Zionism tells regarding the holocaust.  He HAS to know and put two and two together.  He  HAS to be very aware of just how likely it is that the level of deceit responsible for the holocaust lies means that the Israeli involvement in 911 is very likely, as a result, absolutely true as well.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t just ignore that.</p>

<p>And the fact that he does is...not very good, and pretty damning, it seems to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s made his mark and now he&#39;s just living his life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough.  I&#39;m not trying to fault him for not undertaking some sort of one man mission to bring down Zionism, etc.  Of course not.  I&#39;m just faulting him for being AS MUCH of an abject denier of what seems to be the truth of 911 chicanery as he seemed to be in the statement he gave above.</p>

<p>He spent years of his life bravely fighting being labeled a holocaust &quot;denier/revisionist&quot;, and for that I definitely commend him, but then he turns around and, in effect, becomes the very same type of denier where it regards what happened on 911 and who was really responsible for it.  WTF?</p>

<p>That&#39;s some pretty fucked up mental gymnastics on his part, if you ask me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wasn&#39;t disappointed by this AMA.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It wasn&#39;t a horrible one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For those that were, they need to really think about Cole&#39;s answers here and understand where he&#39;s coming from.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, it wasn&#39;t a horrible AMA.  I&#39;m not expecting the dude to come out with &quot;all the truth!&quot; or whatever.  I&#39;m just being very critical of HOW BADLY he just told a straight up, bold face lie about an issue that I know he HAAAAS to know about.  That&#39;s all.</p>

<p>Peace to you,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i read all his comments and there wasn&#39;t anything interesting he wrote i mean he concluded that jews were killed and thats fine - its obvious though and said it wasn&#39;t 6 million jews killed it was 3 million. like that is really different its still a lot of of people being killed wether they were gassed or not its not a big deal tbh they were still killed. over the years of researc he slowly increased the figure from 150k to 1.1million to 2 million to 3 million and soon according to him it will be 6 million just as the mainstream historians wrote but they weren&#39;t gassed- so what - it just seems like a little disinformation, I don&#39;t know, further reading is needed I guess. Not much of a conspiracy here.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me started on his views on 9/11, muslims and god knows what else </p>

I used to defend David against people saying he was a shill and now I find out that he is a Zionist AND he believes the official story of 9/11. Dude is just out to make money for himself, so pissed off at myself for defending this guy............ Here&#39;s a question for David: Why don&#39;t you go out and get a normal job like the rest of us? Do you think you can skate off your celebrity status for the rest of your life without having to work for a living? Maybe you&#39;ll just get back into politics and buddy up with whomever agrees to pay you. </p>

How do you expect anyone to live in peace when you point your finger and judge them for doing the same things you do, only when they do it it&#39;s bad because they&#39;re slightly different from you and when you do it it&#39;s good but when the other does it it&#39;s bad.

I was the right guy at the right time. I found my &quot;peer review&quot; by doing talk shows. I write at length in my book about how I manipulated my Donahue Show appearance in order to get my work reviewed by the top names in the field.

<p>Nonsense. Rudolf confirmed Leuchter, and so did the Krakow Institute in its first test:</p>

<p><a href="http://codoh.com/library/document/2963/">http://codoh.com/library/document/2963/</a></p>

<p>Edit: <strong>Some background for those actually interested</strong>:</p>

<p><a href="http://codoh.com/library/chapter/1836/#green">http://codoh.com/library/chapter/1836/#green</a></p>

<p>The second Krakow test intentionally decided not to test for iron-cyanide compounds, despite iron being in brickwork, and the alleged &quot;gas chamber&quot; structures being made essentially of brick. If you don&#39;t look for the long-lasting, stable iron-cyanide compounds, then the measurements are obviously lower, and the delousing chamber will have the same trace levels of cyanide residue as the &quot;gas chamber&quot;. Exterminationists use this to say there therefore must&#39;ve been &quot;gassings&quot; in both structures... but, as I say, to get the results necessary to make this argument, you have to decide <em>not</em> to test for iron-cyanide compounds.</p>

<p>Another argument is that because humans are more sensitive to cyanide gas than lice, and because in these conditions its very difficult (in reality, not) to form Prussian Blue (iron-cyanide), that the gas chambers somehow didn&#39;t get enough exposure to hydro-cyanide gas for <em>any</em> to form there, and that <em>this</em> explains the results of Rudolf, Leuchter, and the first Krakow test: <em>&quot;see? Gassings took place here, but so little gas was used that it didn&#39;t stain the walls with Prussian Blue, like it did in the delousing rooms.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Rudolf responds to Green&#39;s attacks in the link above, and here:</p>

<p><a href="http://vho.org/GB/c/GR/CharacterAssassins.html">http://vho.org/GB/c/GR/CharacterAssassins.html</a></p>

<p>Germar Rudolf, was a chemist at the prestigious Max Planck Insitute when his research was released. His Ph.D thesis, which was approved by 170 academics, was about ferro-cyanide compounds in brickwork and masonry. He was imprisoned in Germany for doing the tests on the gas chamber walls and writing about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So PersonMcName is a, er, &quot;specialist&quot; Holohoax defender who shows up for threads like this? I was kind-of getting that feeling here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2p13qt/im_david_cole_aka_stein_the_jewish_holocaust/cmsn9sx">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2p13qt/im_david_cole_aka_stein_the_jewish_holocaust/cmsn9sx</a></p>

<p><strong>He argues that it would&#39;ve been too difficult for Prussian Blue to form in the &quot;gas chambers&quot; because they &quot;weren&#39;t exposed to enough gas&quot;. But there are documented cases where Prussian Blue has formed after a single fumigation.</strong></p>

<p>See: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2p13qt/im_david_cole_aka_stein_the_jewish_holocaust/cmu0tke">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2p13qt/im_david_cole_aka_stein_the_jewish_holocaust/cmu0tke</a></p>

<p>All he&#39;s doing is attempting to regurgitate the arguments of Green and Mathis. There&#39;s a great thread at CODOH where Mathis (&#39;aemathisphd&#39;) turns up, makes a couple of okay points, but then quickly humiliates himself [and accidentally points out that Green confuses water and sulphuric acid!], before fleeing:</p>

<p><a href="http://forum.codoh.com/viewtopic.php?t=267">http://forum.codoh.com/viewtopic.php?t=267</a></p>

<p>The post-Pressac pseudoscientific buffoonery is just a desperate rear-guard action by the defenders of the Hoax. The problem is this: due to the arguments for why there&#39;s no Prussian Blue in the gas chambers being of a more technical nature, they&#39;re slightly more difficult to expose than the more obvious historiographical, logistical and structural problems (etc), and so people like PersonMcName can attempt to trick others into thinking they have a credible scientific refutation, as in that first link, and that all of the tests (except the second Krakow test) must&#39;ve been wrong. It&#39;s a strategy which likely prevents many non-technically-minded believers from losing their faith: &quot;oh, see, SCIENCE WORDS confirm that revisionists are wrong!&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>Edit: If you look at my conversations with him, you&#39;ll see how he simply ignores my requests that he substantiate his position by quantitatively defining the variables, and thus the minimum exposure level, for Prussian Blue to form in brickwork. It&#39;s all just <em>&quot;well, there wasn&#39;t enough cyanide gas used, um, because.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Elsewhere I&#39;ve explained how Pressac (an Exterminationist) estimates 5-7kg of Z-B per gassing because (1) Z-B out-gasses slowly, over 2hrs, much longer in cold weather, and (2) the witnesses all say the victims died within a few minutes, i.e. very early in the Z-B out-gassing cycle. So, it turns out that the first technical study of the gassings by an Exterminationist -- almost 50 years after the events -- shows that a lot of Z-B would&#39;ve been necessary, not merely the amount to achieve the LD100 for humans after the complete gassing cycle.</p>

<p>This, of course, raises the problem that when the SK enter the gas chamber, the Z-B is still releasing its gas, and would continue to do so for at least another 1.5hrs. To get around this, Pressac simply invents a mechanism by which the Z-B is removed from the chamber after everyone is dead, despite no evidence of such a mechanism, and no witness or historian mentioning one before him.</p>

<p>This article provides some very good documentation for the use of gas vans by the nazis.</p>

<p>2.How did the actual holocaust happen in your view? How much of the &quot;official&quot; story are just lies from eye witnesses and how much of it is true?</p>

<p>3.Outside of you books where is your main source of income? It would seem exceptionally difficult to get a job given your reputation, or are there decent people out there that gives jobs to people despite others defaming them?</p>

<p>Thanks for doing the AMA.</p>

<p>I was thinking the same thing. I don&#39;t understand why this guy has a stickied AMA in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> - I would guess that it&#39;s probably because the agenda here is to bring this whole subreddit community down to the level that the <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> community likes to describe us as, and just generally how the establishment would like all public forums for real news/alternative worldviews to be clogged with bullshit and diversions like this guy and his information.</p>

<p>Ya know, things that both discredit us all and also add nothing constructive to the world we live in today/have no relevance to anything that could change the world or the way that we are living.</p>

<p>The dude was almost killed for his research so he vowed to give it up forever. This was before 9/11 even happened.</p>

<p>I would be fucking fed up with all this bullshit too if someone literally put a bounty on my head. I wouldn&#39;t even look back.</p>

<p>He openly admits he hasn&#39;t even <em>looked</em> into the 9/11 conspiracy. It&#39;s not on his radar. He&#39;s no longer a &quot;truth&quot; warrior like so many armchair warriors on the internet.</p>

<p>He&#39;s picked his battles.</p>

<p>I disagree with his views on 9/11 and Zionism, but I still <em>respect</em> the man and his opinions.</p>

<p>He&#39;s not shoving his Zionism in peoples faces. He was simply being honest and answering questions.</p>

<p>I warned him that his beliefs on conspiracy theories would not be popular her. He knew what he was getting into...and he was true to his convictions, and I commend him for that.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m surprised at the amount of people who claim to have followed Cole for years who are &quot;shocked&quot; at his &quot;revelations&quot; that he&#39;s been open about for a long, long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Early reports state that victims at Treblinka were electrocuted and steamed to death like lobsters. The latest theory is that the Evil Nazys decided to use the most inefficient method of killing available: carbon monoxide from a diesel engine.</p>

<p>The 700-900k bodies were then buried in enormous mass graves (which would&#39;ve had to have been many times larger than witnesses describe), dug up some time later, and the damp bodies stacked 20-30 high, in rows on top of rail tracks, and burned in the open air, year round, with no wind shield, and 70cm of room for wood fuel beneath. The piled up bodies allegedly burnt down to ash and skeleton. The bones and teeth were totally crushed and with the ashes were scattered, and disappeared without a trace.</p>

<p>Despite being the &quot;end of the line&quot;, numerous survivors report being transited through Treblinka.</p>

<p>Edit: My only hope is that I can one day get as drunk as David Cole so that I too may believe this.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEJ_7vJIuUc">6 million</a> is a figure that some people were using in a lot of different ways.  It is some sort of Talmudic magic number.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a Talmudic phrase interpreted to mean that 6 million must be lost before jews can reestablish the holy land.  There are two news reports prior to ww2 (you can find images of the newspaper reports online, im not finding them again) where the number 6 million was also used and some people think this is evidence of Zionists trying to force the number into consciousness in order to be closer to fulfilling prophecy, which was successfully done in ww2.  I want to make clear I&#39;m not convinced either way, its a little fishy though.  Also fishy that revisionist talk is outlawed in some countries.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a Holocaust, no doubt. But not 6 million.</p>

<p>c.1250, &quot;sacrifice by fire, burnt offering,&quot; from Gk. holokauston, neut. of holokaustos &quot;burned whole,&quot; from holos &quot;whole&quot; + kaustos, verbal adj. of kaiein &quot;to burn.&quot; Originally a Bible word for &quot;burnt offerings,&quot; given wider sense of &quot;massacre, destruction of a large number of persons&quot; from 1833. The Holocaust &quot;Nazi genocide of European Jews in World War II,&quot; first recorded 1957, earlier known in Heb. as Shoah &quot;catastrophe.&quot; The word itself was used in Eng. in ref. to Hitler&#39;s Jewish policies from 1942, but not as a proper name for them.</p>

<p>This AMA has been so beautifully the opposite of what all your detractors were fearmongering about.  I&#39;ve learned a few things, I&#39;ve watched other people learn a few things.  </p>

<p>This whole thing reminds me of a story a wise old man told me long ago.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>There was an old man and his wife, they had lived together for many years</strong></p>

<p><strong>The old man was growing frustrated with his wife because she had become very hard of hearing, and no matter what the old man did or said he couldn&#39;t convince his wife that she needed to have her ears checked.</strong></p>

<p><strong>One day the old man devised a plan to prove once and for all to his wife that she needed to go have her hearing examined, so the old man sneaked up behind his wife while she was washing dishes, He stood about 10 feet behind her and said &quot;Can you hear me?&quot; in a bold voice.</strong></p>

<p><strong>His wife said nothing in return so he crept up a few feet closer and repeated himself &quot;CAN YOU HEAR ME?&quot;, again she didn&#39;t reply so he got even closer to her &quot;CAN YOU HEAR ME!&quot;..</strong></p>

<p><strong>When his wife failed to reply this last time the old man walked right up to her ear, leaned in close and said &quot;CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>His wife spun around with an angry look on her face and said &quot;For the fourth time! I CAN FUCKING HEAR YOU JUST FINE!&quot;</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem I have is that there is no difference between 3million and 6 million its still a massive figure and if true its still genocide. it seems there is not much of a conspiracy if all the difference was the jews weren&#39;t gassed or used for soap they were still killed.</p>

<p>in David&#39;d earlier work he highlighted that the concentration camps were used as much for detaining christians, and general opposition to the third reich and not predominantly for jews.</p>

<p>after years of further research perhaps? David came to the conclusion that it was a holocaust and there were actually slightly less than 6 million killed. wether its 1 million 3million of 6 million its still a huge number.</p>

<p>overall there is not much of a conspiracy here as i thought it would be if the facts are what David said.</p>

<p>All his other opinions I have no interest in knowing since he is blind as a bat when it comes to geopolitics. A disappointing AMA in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 1990 a forensic analysis was performed at Birkenau using microdiffusion techniques to test for cyanide in samples from (suspected) extermination chambers, delousing chambers, and a control group. The control group tested negative while cyanide residue was found in high concentrations in the delousing chambers, and lower concentrations in the homicidal gas chambers. This is consistent with the amounts required to kill lice and humans.</p>

<p>That would be the <em>second</em> test by the Krakow Institute of Forensic Research, in which they specifically did <em>not</em> look for iron-cyanide compounds.</p>

<p>Prior to this, they had tested and actually confirmed Rudolf &amp; Leuchter&#39;s results. <a href="http://codoh.com/library/document/2333/">The report wasn&#39;t published, but it got leaked.</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s most likely because they either never saw it (again, two sites, and not even major ones at that), or just do not care, as it&#39;s so obviously sketchy it&#39;s not even funny, and they have given literally no proof that it&#39;s real aside from telling us that &quot;we totally got this from an insider source who we can&#39;t talk about and who is super real, we swear&quot;. </p>

<p>Not really, since again, it&#39;s so hidden away that even many holocaust deniers are unaware of the claim.

<p>It&#39;s a science paper, it doesn&#39;t matter what journal it&#39;s in (and as a side note: you&#39;d be hard pressed to even be able to consider anything by the IHR a &quot;journal&quot;). If you read it, you&#39;d see that there is apparently data, but it&#39;s just never written up (which just makes the legitimacy even more suspicious than it already was)</p>

<p>We&#39;re talking about the second Krakow test, which you claim proves gassing. This is done by looking at the trace levels of soluble (i.e. short term) compounds in the delousing chamber and the &quot;gas chamber&quot;, noticing they are roughly the same, and deducing &quot;aha, so the gas chambers were <em>also</em> exposed to cyanide.&quot;</p>

<p>The water-soluble compounds are there too, and all you have to do is test both the delousing and gas chambers to see similarly elevated levels compared to everywhere else, and then use the data from the delousing and gas chambers to find out how much there originally was. </p>

<p>It looks more and more obvious that you honestly do not understand this subject, since I&#39;ve repeatedly told you the answer the pretty much all of your questions, just to have you ask them all over again as if I never responded.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are looking only for soluble compounds, it will not tell you anything about cyanide exposure 50 years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll explain this real simply.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We can all agree that cyanide was used in the delousing chambers</p></li>
<li><p>We test both the delousing chambers and the gas chambers for residual cyanide.</p></li>
<li><p>We then compare the numbers to other areas in the camp that were not used as gas chambers. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what the Karkow institue did, and they found that in both the delousing and gas chambers there was a much higher level than anywhere else, and so it&#39;s safe to conclude that cyanide was used. We don&#39;t need to know the exact ppm that existed 50 years ago, we just need to definitively know whether or not large amounts of cyanide were used in the chamber.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>And in both case studies, they left if for a long time. The rate of formation of Prussian Blue is around 30 hours at minimum. Fumigations of that size can easily last that long, and they used somewhat high levels on top of this. And before you point out the levels in the gas chambers, remembers that a) it took far less time, and b) the delousing chambers would have had an proportionally larger level too, which is why it would have formed there but not the gas chambers.</p>

<p>No one&#39;s denying that there was different levels of iron-cyanide compounds in the delousing chambers compared the the gas chambers. The issue is that it&#39;s inherently a flawed measuring system since it&#39;s formation is unfavourable, and takes a lot of time and cyanide to create it.</p>

<p>Except there is no sane justification for excluding iron-cyanide compounds when they are stable and thus long-lasting, and when the structures are built out of brick. The Polish Institute&#39;s excuse is essentially that it didn&#39;t occur to them to include them in the test!</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the [second] Polish study (Markiewicz et. al.) aspired to <strong>measure only the water-soluble cyanide components</strong>, i.e. those components that might be presumed to no longer exist, because soluble cyanide compounds are notoriously unstable and decompose under the influence of air humidity with a <strong>half-life of mere days</strong> and thus cannot be expected to have survived five decades of exposure to the elements. Hence, <strong>whatever can be measured</strong> with such a method, it certainly <strong>cannot conceivably appertain to soluble cyanide compounds deposited 50 years earlier</strong>, no matter how reproducible the results.</p>

<p>... <strong>Excluding insoluble iron cyanides</strong> from the analysis, as the Polish study did, <strong>means excluding the majority of detectable cyanide components</strong>, which is hardly a valid approach.</p>

<p>My logic is that we found high levels of cyanide residue in the gas chambers, and that level was significantly higher than the control areas. Because of this, it seems safe to assume that gassings were carried out in the rooms. </p>

<p>Firstly, Prussian Blue can still weather away. Secondly, we can still test for traces of cyanide and use that in comparison with other areas to definitively test the amount of hydrogen. Since Prussian Blue, again, is very slow to form.</p>

<p>Well, this doesn&#39;t have anything to do with defining the minimum amount of cyanide gas exposure necessary for Prussian Blue to form in brickwork.</p>

<p>Anyway. I&#39;m glad you mentioned Pressac.</p>

<p>According to Pressac, because of the time it takes for the Zyklon-B to out-gas (over 2hrs, longer in colder weather), and because people were said to have died very quickly, roughly 5-7kg of Z-B would have been used per gassing -- many times more than is necessary to achieve 300ppm over its release cycle.</p>

<p>Again, witnesses said everyone died quickly (wildly varying reports, but some as short as &quot;a few minutes&quot;) and that SK entered to clear the &quot;chamber&quot; either immediately or after a short time. <strong>Therefore the Z-B is still out-gassing when they enter.</strong></p>

<p>To get around this problem, and the problem of the high amount of Z-B used -- thus maintaining the defensive argument that <em>&quot;welp, I guess the gas chambers just weren&#39;t exposed to enough cyanide gas!&quot;</em> (lol), according to Pressac, the Z-B was then <em>removed</em>, a short time into its out-gassing cycle (!) -- which none of the &quot;witnesses&quot; or historians ever mention, even once. No evidence of a removal device exists.</p>

<p>So Pressac is inventing history, without evidence, to counter the arguments of the skeptics. This desperate rear-guard action is typical of Holohoax fraudsters.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>If you weren&#39;t intellectually self-castrated, you would actually read and attempt to understand the criticisms of the mainstream history, rather than lazily dismiss them as &quot;toxic&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;, because they challenge your <em>faith</em> in the unassailable truth of 1940&#39;s atrocity propaganda, or your <em>faith</em> that your teachers or religious leaders knew what they were talking about.</p>

<p>Pressac would never even have written his book without the pressure to respond to revisionist arguments. His rear-guard action is critiqued here:</p>

<p>Green is right though. The conditions in the delousing and gas chambers were different, and it shows in the diffent amount of Prussian blue buildup. In the reaction I listed, it&#39;s clear that the limiting reagent is Cyanide, which explains why adding more cyanide would give you an actually completed reaction. </p>

<p>No, he didn&#39;t. He quoted the lethal dose for humans.

<p>Yes, but that doesn&#39;t prove Green&#39;s assertion about there being &quot;not enough&quot; cyanide gas exposure for ANY iron-oxide compounds to form. Obviously the conditions were <em>slightly</em> different - precisely how different is a matter of debate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. You&#39;re engaged in a desperate defense of <em>one</em> aspect of revisionist analysis. It&#39;s clear who is winning here. The Holohoax mythology is ridiculous, and people can see that when they&#39;re given access to all of the details, rather than the superficial, emotional nonsense of Hilberg, Arad, the vicious Jewish supremacist Lipstadt, Spielberg, etc...</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a much better quote, from Pressac - on your &quot;side&quot;, in case you don&#39;t know who he is -- when he came to realize that the forensic side of things couldn&#39;t be reconciled with the testimony which forms the basis of the official historiography:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Michel de Boüard, former &quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot; at Mauthausen, considered that <strong>&quot;the dossier [on the concentration camp system] is rotten&quot;</strong>. On the one hand, resentment and vendetta prevailed over conciliation. Then memory over history.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <strong>the communists&#39; grip on the main organs of command in the camps</strong>, the setting up after the liberation of associations under their control and the establishment for fifty years of a &quot;peoples&#39; democratic&quot; history of the camps have <strong>introduced the virus of antifascist cant</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Approximation, exaggeration, omission and lying characterise the majority of the accounts of that period.</strong> The unanimous and irrevocable discredit in which the communist writings are held can only rub off on a concentration camp experience tainted by their ideas and annihilate it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Boyard&#39;s comment, referenced by Pressac, was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I found myself torn between my conscience as a historian and the duties it implies, and on the other hand, my membership in a group of comrades whom I deeply love, but who refuse to recognize the necessity of <strong>dealing with the deportation as a historical fact in accordance with sound historical methods</strong>.</p>

<p>... <strong>The record is rotten to the core</strong>. On one hand a considerable amount of <strong>fantasies, inaccuracies</strong>, obstinately repeated (in particular concerning numbers), heterogeneous mixtures, generalizations <strong>and, on the other hand, very close critical studies that demonstrate the inanity of those exaggerations</strong>. [i.e. very close critical studies = revisionist analyses.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Boyard was a former inmate at Mauthausen, honorary dean of the Faculty of Letters at the University of Caen, member of the Committee for the History of the Second World War, member of the Institut de France. He made those comments after stepping down as president of the Calvados (Normandy) Association of Deportees in 1985.</p>

<p>I never claimed that just because there were a lot of steps that the reaction is impossible. That&#39;s just stupid. What I said, was that considering Cyanide is the limiting reagent, the fact that among those reactions are quite a few unfavourable and slow reactions, and that because of these it takes either a much larger amount of time to form, if it even has the time to complete all the different steps. (don&#39;t forget that the actual gas chambers were cleaned so it didn&#39;t look suspicious).</p>

<p>And when you then look at how long it would take to kill lice in the same time, you get a much larger amount too, even compared to the 5-7kg that Pressac points out. </p>

<p>Since you&#39;ve taken chemistry apparently, it should be no problem. Just account for the volume of the chamber, the concentration of cyanide added, the reaction rate for all the steps listed (and accounting for both the rate limiting step and the limiting reagent). And then calculate based on how long each gassing was, how much of the reaction would have formed. The number you&#39;ll get will be extremely small, if it even manages to form at all given the time constraints.</p>

<p>How would I estimate that in numerical terms? There are only so many way to speed up a reaction that were also used in the gas chambers for another reason. The list is pretty much</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Add more solute</p></li>
<li><p>Wait longer, which doesn&#39;t actually speed it up, but would make it more likely to actually form Prussian Blue.</p></li>

<p>It does actually. In all of these cases, cyanide is the limiting reagent, which means that when it runs out, no matter how much of the other compounds there are, you can&#39;t form more. This is important, because it means that there was nowhere near enough to complete the reaction, especially considering the timeframe, and glacial reaction rate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s how I know you&#39;re full of shit.</p>

<p>You bluff that the gas chambers weren&#39;t exposed to enough cyanide gas for Prussian Blue to form, because its <em>so difficult for iron-cyande compounds to form</em>, but <strong>there are case studies where Prussian Blue has formed after a single exposure.</strong></p>

<p>This next quote relates to a church in Untergriesbach, Germany. The page is in German but I&#39;ve translated the relevant passage for you:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The interior restoration was well advanced, and in the summer of 1972 the <strong>fumigation of the entire interior with Zyklon B</strong> to combat wood worm in the altars <strong>resulted in significant damage</strong>: Including the vault frescoes, lunettes and capitals of the pilasters had severe discoloration and stains, the altar leaves <strong>showed significant blue cast, all gilded as if deposits had formed.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>[From section beginning &quot;Die Innenrestaurierung war weit gediehen, als im Sommer 1972...&quot;]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pfarrei-untergriesbach.de/pfarrbrief11.htm">http://www.pfarrei-untergriesbach.de/pfarrbrief11.htm</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s another case, similar to the one above, in which <a href="http://vho.org/GB/Books/dth/fndwood.html">blue stains formed after a single fumigation in 1976</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...a church of average size was extensively restored. Aside from drying out the brickwork and removing salt deposits, a fumigation with hydrogen cyanide (of the Zyklon B type) was also performed.</p>

<p>...Several months after the building was opened to the public, <strong>small ink-blue spots appeared</strong> at various places on the newly plastered surfaces. Little attention was paid to them at first; it was assumed that they were ink stains or the like. But <strong>the spots grew larger</strong>, and in some parts of the building discolored patches up to about a square meter (10 sq.ft.) in size developed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://vho.org/GB/Books/dth/fndwood.html">Rudolf was able to test the stains and confirm that it was Prussian Blue</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It took chemical analyses of the plaster to determine the causes of this blue discoloration. These analyses confirmed the initial suspicion that the substance known as Berlin Blue had formed.</p>

<p>Chemically speaking, hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is a very weak acid. It is bound by damp, highly alkaline brickwork through neutralization. This produces calcium cyanide (Ca(CN)2), for example:</p>

<p>2 HCN + Ca(OH)2 Þ Ca(CN)2 + 2 H2O</p>

<p>The cyanide ion is a highly reactive ion, which joins with metals to form very stable complex salts. The best-known complex salts are the yellow and red iron cyanides. These compounds form when iron ions combine with cyanide: with the iron(II) ion, the yellow ferrocyanide forms, and with the iron(III) ion, the red ferricyanide is produced:</p>

<p>6 CN- + Fe2+ Þ [Fe(CN)6]4-</p>

<p>6 CN- + Fe3+ Þ [Fe(CN)6]3-</p>

<p>In the presence of excess iron(II) or iron(III) ions, the yellow or red iron cyanide then reacts to form blue compounds which are described in the literature as Berlin Blue and Turnbull&#39;s Blue, respectively:</p>

<p>[Fe(CN)6]4- + Fe3+ Þ [FeIIFeIII(CN)6]-</p>

<p>[Fe(CN)6]3- + Fe2+ Þ [FeIIIFeII(CN)6]-</p>

<p>The formation of these compounds was what had caused the discoloration at the plaster&#39;s surface in the church. Conclusive proof of this was easily furnished. Spraying plaster surfaces which had not yet turned blue with a solution of iron(II) or iron(III) salts, respectively, produced a spontaneous blue discoloration, which otherwise would have formed only slowly, as the reaction progressed by itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Q: Can Prussian Blue form only after very long periods of exposure to high levels of cyanide gas?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>A: No, it can occur after a single exposure (of a concentration lower than that reached with a full Z-B outgassing.)</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>By the way, due to <a href="http://vho.org/GB/Books/trr/Image19.gif">the [slow] out-gassing cycle of Z-B</a>, and the witness statements that victims died in just a few minutes, the exposure of the &quot;gas chamber&quot; walls would&#39;ve been much higher than 300ppm -- they would&#39;ve had to have achieved that level after about 10% of the Z-B&#39;s outgassing cycle, depending on air temperature, (i.e. in winter they would&#39;ve used much more Z-B.)</p>

<p>They would&#39;ve aimed for a level higher than 300ppm, also, as human sensitivity to cyanide gas varies quite a bit - 2000ppm is used in US gas chambers. Pressac estimates 5-7kg of Z-B per gassing. Thus the &quot;gas chambers&quot; were exposed to levels as high as the delousing chambers, if not higher, just for less time.</p>

<p>True, but this is inconsistent with witness testimony.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>guys would start ventilating the room</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that, depending on whose account of &quot;ventilation&quot; time you accept, the Z-B would continue to outgas for approximately another 1.5-2hrs, as the room is being cleared. Thus the rest of the crematorium complex would also be exposed to cyanide gas -- something no &quot;witnesses&quot; mention.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is for the rooms that had prussian blue formation after 1 exposure?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The question then is how does frequency of exposure affect for formation?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Presumably it increases the amount of formation, as in the delousing rooms. However in citing these two case studies, I intended to show that iron-cyanide compounds can form in brickwork/plaster/etc after just a single exposure.</p>

<p>To really understand this, we need to define the minimum level of cyanide gas exposure necessary for the reaction to occur in the &quot;gas chamber&quot; brickwork. (Concentration, time - and the environmental variables: brick components, porousness, humidity, temperature - etc)</p>

<p>Do you have any estimates for the above?</p>

<p>Plea bargain? He&#39;s being indicted because he <em>willingly</em> came forward out of obscurity to admit what he saw. He did this because Holocaust denial was repellent to him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was stationed close to Auschwitz and according to his account he regularly had to visit the Auschwitz main camp as part of his job. He claims he only visited Auschwitz-Birkenau once or twice and described it as dirtier and nastier than the Auschwitz main camp or Stammlager where inmates were relatively better off, having luxuries and distractions available to them such as a swimming pool, theatre and even a brothel. He never saw any evidence of gassings at the Auschwitz main camp and yet today tourists are shown a phoney gas chamber that was &quot;reconstructed&quot; after the war by the Soviets. The work of Cole and others has shown beyond any doubt that this facility could never have served as a homicidal gas chamber. The authorities even admit that this gas chamber was &quot;reconstructed&quot; after the war by the Soviets. David Cole got the head of the Auschwitz State Museum to admit this on film, and yet tourists are still told that people were gassed at this facility. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is the gas chamber shown to tourists at the Auschwitz Stammlager is a fraud. Cole&#39;s documentary on Auschwitz clearly shows how and why this so called gas chamber never could have served the purpose that is claimed. The thing has a chimney built onto it that connects to nothing within the so called gas chamber. It&#39;s purely there for show. Also the Zyklon B induction holes on the top of the gas chamber are mysteriously missing in aerial photographs taken by allied reconnaissance planes taken during the time when the mass gassings at Auschwitz were supposedly taking place. How many more clues do you need to work out someone is pulling your leg?</p>

If you&#39;re an Auschwitz SS guy who knows it was all bull, you might remain silent for fear of prosecution--but you&#39;d sure as hell leave your refutation in the form of a memoir.

Mengele insisted to his son that the Jews he experimented on volunteered and got &quot;goodies&quot; for doing so.  But there&#39;s no indication--to my knowledge, at least--that he denied the Zyklon B mass gassings.

<p>2: They&#39;ve already lowered the death counts of several camps with Auschwitz dropping to 1 million, so 6 million is impossible already.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Say the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust was N<sup>total.</sup> The number of Jews who died in Auschwitz was N<sup>auschwitz.</sup></p>

<p>You are assuming that the function that determines the value of N<sup>total</sup> must contain the variable N<sup>auschwitz.</sup> If it didn&#39;t, then it would be unaffected by erroneous values of N<sup>auschwitz.</sup></p>

<p>N<sup>total</sup> <em>can</em> be calculated by N<sup>auschwitz</sup> + N<sup>treblinka</sup> etc... The number of Jews that died during WWII need not be calculated using a formula that contained N<sup>auschwitz.</sup> N<sup>total</sup> can be calculated myriad different ways... For example: N<sup>total</sup> = N<sup>Jews-alive-after-holocaust</sup> - N<sup>jews-alive-before-holocaust.</sup> </p>

<p>You have to prove that the number 6 million was derived from <em>that</em> formula for your argument to have any implications. Proper historians wouldn&#39;t rely on potentially bad data and would always confirm through multiple sources. Therefore, this would be the least preferable method to determine the Jewish death toll of WWII. This wasn&#39;t how they figured out those numbers.</p>

<p>90% of the 3 million Polish Jews were dead by the end of WWII. That&#39;s 2.5 - 2.8 million Jews alone... Just from Poland. The facts show that there were 9 million Jews in Europe before WWII, that they were gathered from across Nazi-occupied Germany into ghettos and camps and that there were only several million European Jews left in the world after WWII. Even today, the number of European Jews is very close to the number in 1944 -- something that you would not expect unless there was a drastic decrease in population. There are many, many ways to estimate the number of Jews who were killed in WWII. Historians constantly come to a number very close to 6 million. This is always more than 2/3 of European Jews. This is a higher proportion than any other community. If you&#39;ve read Hitler&#39;s Mein Kampf and studied the politics of Nazi Germany, it is an inescapable conclusion that Jews were targeted for extermination. </p>

<p>The question I have for you is... Why did the Nazis take away my grandmother&#39;s child sister? Where did all of the kids go? Where were the daycares at Auschwitz for the kids? My answer is, they were taken to be killed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I state in my book, there was never a central plan. Policy toward Jews varied by year, and by country. From 1942 through 1943 there was a policy, quite clearly described by Goebbels in his diary, to reduce the population of Polish Jews by about 60%. That figure was backed up by the Korherr Report. Separately, Jews from Germany were sent east, with the idea that once the Germans defeated the Russians, they&#39;d be expelled. When the Front stalled and turned to shit for the Germans, it was decided that it was dangerous having so many Jews in the Ostland, and most were liquidated. These are all individual pieces of a tragedy. But there was never a single &quot;plan.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Soon the last Holocaust survivors will be dead. There will be no one left with a first-hand experience of what happened at these camps.</p>

<p>You are sowing doubt in places where there isn&#39;t any. Every year that passes there are fewer eye witnesses to defend the <em>very existence</em> of millions of these murder victims.</p>

<p>Did you not notice how you are treated here because of your beliefs about 9/11 and Israel? Many people who join &quot;truth movements&quot; do it for other reasons than the truth. To these people, conspiracy is a worldview and a religion. Since you <em>disagree</em>, you&#39;re the enemy who literally serves Satan (aka. the NWO, Jews, etc...).   </p>

<p>The Holocaust revisionist movement will always be dominated by these types of people. You are adding confusion to the legacy of survivors at the first point in history when we don&#39;t have their personal experiences as an asset. </p>

<p>We live in a world where people believe that the Boston Bombing or Sandy Hook were not just conspired, but completely fictitious events. </p>

<p>To call these well-documented events is an understatement. They are fully documented beyond any shred of doubt. The truthers claim the people didn&#39;t even exist, despite there being a hundred thousand+ personal contacts of victims and witnesses. </p>

<p>There are people to whom there is no evidence that can convince them they&#39;re wrong. Do you think that your activities will really result in good? Why do you have to add more fuel to the crazy fire? This is a time in history when Holocaust museums are targeted by shooters almost annually. There has never been a faster spread of hoaxes and lies than now. All you&#39;re doing is becoming the darling child of the degenerate faction of society who hate you because you&#39;re Jewish anyways. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conspiracy of Silence, a documentary listed for viewing in TV Guide Magazine was to be aired on the Discovery Channel, on May 3, 1994. This documentary exposed a network of religious leaders and Washington politicians who flew children to Washington D.C. for sex orgies.</p>

<p>At the last minute before airing, unknown congressmen threatened the TV Cable industry with restrictive legislation if this documentary was aired. Almost immediately, the rights to the documentary were purchased by unknown persons who had ordered all copies destroyed.</p>

<p>However, a rough-cut of the documentary was leaked..this is the leaked version.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my book, I transcribed recorded phone calls between us from 1994, in which Shermer admitted that he lied on the Donahue Show, and that he lied to his readers about my work in &quot;Skeptic Magazine.&quot; I also transcribed a recorded interview he gave in early &#39;95, in which he admitted falsely calling me an anti-Semite, and in which he admitted that I&#39;m probably right regarding the gas chambers. When Sherm learned about these transcribed calls, he had his lawyers threaten my publisher. Within 24 hours, I got them to run away like mice, with their tails between their legs. He hasn&#39;t troubled me since. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was me and I didn&#39;t delete it; thanks for bring it to my attention that it has been banned. That to me is a clear sign that they don&#39;t want us talking about it. If it were controlled opposition, then why are they hiding discussion of it?</p>

<p>Socialism itself is simply a group working together for the benefit of all. It does not mean it&#39;s necessarily Jewish. That was the difference between Communism and NS.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen you around on this thread and you seem pretty versed...perhaps you haven&#39;t read all the benefits that NS brings to a people. ANP14.com would be a good place to start.</p>

<p>I am NS. I want workers to be treated fairly, industry to stay in the the country, no fake money or ridiculous debts, real talented people creating art from all walks of life instead of Kardashians...I could go on, but I assure you it&#39;s not controlled op. Listen to the ANP talkshoe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Incredibly enough, it&#39;s been ten years this month since we broke the story about vote-rigging software whistleblower Clint Curtis.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not surprising as it involves election fraud, touch-screen voting systems, Florida, a powerful Congressman, the Bush family, Chinese spies and several disturbing deaths.</p>

<p>In short, Curtis was a software programmer from Oviedo, FL who claimed in a sworn 2004 affidavit and then sworn testimony before members of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee, that he was asked to create a vote-rigging software prototype for touch-screen voting systems back in 2000 by then Rep. Tom Feeney (R-FL), a very powerful Republican in the Sunshine State and a close friend of the Bush family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I can say is this: I used to be a fan of him and now I&#39;m glad I never gave him a single penny before this AMA. I have come across people like him in the &quot;conspiracy&quot; movement before and now I can honestly say that whenever someone refuses to answer some questions, and has a book/product to sell, they are full of crap. I always wondered why Ryan Dawson never asked David about 9/11 and now I can say confidently that Ryan Dawson and David had behind the scenes deals to promote each others work (try to make money for each other) as long as they agreed to certain rules. Absolutely disgusting. I stopped following Ryan after I saw him constantly beg for donation money and now I&#39;m done with David Cole. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly that would make more sense to me but I thought his alliance with the GOP was just to keep himself safe, I didn&#39;t think he actually thought it was a good entity until this AMA. And either way, aligning yourself with either of the two parties (two wings of the same bird) is absurd for anyone calling themselves a historian to do. My personal opinions on politics in America are that they are completely rigged, along with the mainstream media/music/movie industry. David is just someone trying to make money rather than search out the truth and speak truth because the truth these days does not get one a lot of money, it gets them targeted... so I wouldn&#39;t doubt that he is just saying he&#39;s a Zionist and pro-GOP to save himself but that&#39;s not going to stop me from not supporting him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the support. I forgot to mention in my reply to him that he ignored my question about how he can support the creation of Israel despite exposing the lies that Israel used (&quot;6 million Jews killed!&quot;) to get created but it all makes sense to me now. David, along with every other person who wants to promote their book or beg for donation money, is only out for themselves. They couldn&#39;t care less about the big picture, and I&#39;m sure any other questions I have will now be ignored. It&#39;s actually hilarious if you look through my post history for today and see how quickly I went from defending him in multiple posts, to now seeing what he truly is. I actually defended this guy a lot over the past 6 months on the internet...lesson learned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand how people are confused about this subject. Israel is not being created. It was created 70 years ago. Being a Zionist doesn&#39;t mean you think the past was 100% moral. In this day and age, Zionist means that you don&#39;t think that Israel should lose its sovereign status. Furthermore, it means that you&#39;re against anti-Zionism, which is usually fueled by Arab Nationalism (reverse Zionism), anti-West or even anti-Jew sentiments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s impossible to say what anti-Zionist really means because there are so many definitions of Zionism. I don&#39;t know what facts or world view you subscribe to, so there&#39;s not much I can say. If you literally have different assumptions, any dialogue between us is pointless. </p>

<p>The minimum to be considered a Zionist means that you support a sovereign state for ethnic Jews. If you are anti-Zionist in this sense, but you support a sovereign state for ethnic Iranians or French, then you are anti-Jew. If you claim to be anti-Nationalism in its entirety, but you only talk about Israel, you are probably anti-Jew, whether or not you&#39;ve admitted it to yourself. There are other more dangerous Nationalist movements in this world, for example in Greece, that do no receive 1% of the international attention of Israel. </p>

<p>So what? If I told you that I think that ethnic Turks should keep their sovereign state of Turkey, does that mean I support all of their countries crimes against humanity? It&#39;s a country with a record just as bad as Israel. No! In fact, because I am not anti-Turkish, I do not equivocate rights of the people in the state with the actions of the state. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In addition, I don&#39;t have to have a position on the ideology, the legitimacy of the government or the notion of a Jewish or Israeli nation-state. I don&#39;t have a position on equivalent concepts for other countries. I can be completely neutral and be against anyone who would say that a country should lose it sovereignity. According to anti-Zionists, I am a Zionist. In reality, I am not an anti-Zionist and I am not a Zionist. </p>

<p>The way I see it, when you have strong opinions on a subject, where failed outcomes have no bearing on your life, you are a meddler. When you have no skin in the game, you simply can never understand the issue as someone who suffers the consequences day after day. </p>

<p>Ideally, we would all be informed world citizens with well-reasoned opinions about current issues that affect human welfare throughout the world. But at the same time I know my opinions are based on <em>limited and biased information</em>. I care enough that I want the outcome to have the greatest possible good. I know enough to have some understanding of the situation. But I do not demand that they give up anything because I must satisfy my devotion to my personal ideals. With no skin in the game, I do not have the right to meddle... nor am I that self-righteous and self-satisfied. I&#39;ve been wrong enough too many times to be that delusional. </p>

<p>The route to peace is through compromise. That may be an ideal but it is also a fact. No country was born without guilt and I&#39;m not going to start with Israel if I get the grandiose desire to fix the past. </p>

<p>During wartime, all other nations locked up hostile foreigners. The various statements/activites by international Jewish groups to the effect of a &quot;holy war on Germany&quot; justifies this policy by the NSDAP.</p>

<p>That said, there were many nationalist, assimilationist German-Jews (especially veterans from WWI) who seemed to support the goals of the NSDAP, but the &quot;Nazis&quot; turned their back on them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your reply David, very interesting, not the reply I had anticipated.  While there was a lot of Rothschild involvement in initially setting up and funding Israel, the &#39;Rothschild controls Israel&#39; idea will have to remain as conspiracy as there is no hard evidence like you say.</p>

<p>There&#39;s quite a lot about their involvement with Zionism and Israel on their family Wikipedia page, it also mentions their financing of the Suez Canal project.</p>

<p>The Balfour declaration was signed before the second world war even started and it was negotiated by lord Rothchild to establish a jewish (but predominantly zionist) state.

    <div class="md"><p>Dear David, from Moonlit History of Facebook:--</p>

<p>I am in concordance with you, Irving and Weber on the Reinhardt camps and the mass-killings on the Eastern Front. It happened and it was horrible. However, it is strange how that small portion of Jewish death is the most sought-after element of the bloodbath we call World War II.</p>

<p>I get a lot of flak from &quot;deniers&quot; too because of my views. But I believe a wanna-be historian, such as myself, should always adhere to the principles of honest criticism towards history and not allow bias opinions to formulate answers.</p>

<p>With that said, it&#39;s obvious that the Jewish holocaust story has shifted and changed throughout the decades. The holocaust story of 1945 was a lie to the world. No extermination camps or gas chambers were on German soil--yet the Western forces claimed to have liberated many death camps. No Jews were made into soap or lampshades; no Polish prisoners had their head shrunk (and none of these pieces of &quot;evidence&quot;, which were displayed at the Nuremberg Trials, were ever recovered by the allies to be authenticated).</p>

<p>Just some good ol&#39; fashion propaganda. Few people seem to remember the propaganda used during World War I. Some of it was anti-German, like the stories of Belgium babies and crucified Canadians. All of which were lies crafted by the &quot;allied powers.&quot; There were many reports of 6,000,000 Jews being persecuted and killed. But it wasn&#39;t by the Germans, it was the Russians. The Library of Congress has a lot of those articles archived. Here are a few examples: </p>

<p>My question to you is: why?</p>

<p>Why lie to the world? Why create a holocaust story that is entirely different from the reality it resides in? To exploit the Jewish suffering for reparations (Finkelstein, 2000)? To provide a reason for Israel&#39;s existence and wars of survival (Segev, 1993)?</p>

<p>The Nuremberg Trials were to for ever demean the Germans as evil monsters. At the expense of an awful level of double-standards committed by the &quot;four most mightiest of nations.&quot; The German invasion of Norway, under Article 6 (a) of the Nuremberg Charter, was labeled a &quot;crime against peace&quot; and a &quot;war of aggression&quot;--but the British and French were already planning to invade Norway before the Germans did (which was code-named Operation Stratford).</p>

<p>The American and British forces, during the Sino-Japanese war, treated the Japanese far more equally than the Chinese. Shanghai was split up into concessions, with each foreign country governing a permitted part. And all of this at the expense of the Chinese population, who starved and suffered the most from such an Imperialist occupation.</p>

<p>In 1938 the American population showed more distraught over Hitler&#39;s seizing of Czechoslovakia than Japan&#39;s fragmentary conquest of China (which was possible through purchased British and American war materials).</p>

<p>It was only after the endangerment of economic interests--in the Philippines and China from Japanese expansionism--when the West decided to severe ties altogether. Which pissed the Japs off and eventually led to the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Well, what do you expect? 80% of their oil came from the United States.</p>

<p>Was the holocaust truly the worst and most vile thing humans ever did, as Justice Robert Jackson tried to portray during the International Military Tribunal? Was the &quot;10 years of Jew-baiting&quot; only a dye of the National Socialists and no-one else?--The truth is, there have been worse events in history. The Native American Holocaust, that took place over an entire landmass, lasted for hundreds of years and was perpetrated mainly by Christian European settlers who raped, enslaved, burnt, starved, raped again, and made the populations convert to a foreign mythology. We never got our homeland back. We never got reparations. And we almost completely died off (along with the native people of Australia, New Zealand, etc). And to further offer Hitchensian rhetoric: it was not the Nazis&#39; influence that led to the mass-killings, it was actually from &quot;the result of 2,000 years of Christianity. Based on one verse, of one chapter of St. John&#39;s Gospel, which led to a pogrom after every Easter Sermon every year for hundreds of years.&quot; Pope John Paul II was kind enough to apologize for the church&#39;s totalitarian rule of 20 centuries. He apologized for: the Inquisition; the burning and killing of women, Jews, homosexuals, and other religious sects; the African slave trade (that led to the death and enslavement of at least 60 - 100 million souls, by some estimates); the Crusades, etc. (For furthering reading: The Guardian, &quot;Pope Says Sorry for Sins of Church,&quot; March 13, 2000.)</p>

<p>There is something wrong with this world. I would not say it is entirely a &quot;Zionist conspiracy&quot; of sorts (although Zundel, the Neo-Nazi, was acquitted on that charge in the 80&#39;s), but it&#39;s more like a human conspiracy to &quot;distill our uneasy conscious&quot; over the brutal warfare and hypocrisy of our past. We have given the burden of guilt onto a scapegoat, which happens to be the Nazi Bastards, by &quot;training and sensitivity on holocaust awareness&quot; within school systems and textbooks and pop-culture. Hell, Stalin was more damn evil than Hitler--and he was a damn ally! Stalin doesn&#39;t get the recognition Hitler does when it comes to &quot;evilness.&quot; He should. Stalin killed more people than Hitler and he was planning to exterminate all the Jews in Soviet territory before his death! Pogroms, mass deportations, and purges had already happened. (For further reading: UnitedwithIsrael.org, &quot;Soviet Jews Saved From Stalin’s Genocidal Plans on Purim,&quot; March 10, 2014.)</p>

<p>Hypocrisy, thy name is us.</p>

<p>I am glad I live in a country where there is Freedom of Speech and Expression (so I can be typing this up and posting it on here). That is the true outcry to all this. We deserve to hold opinions and to express them, no matter how strange they might be. Sure, I don&#39;t exactly agree with the folks from the Westboro Baptist Church, but they have a right to voice their opinions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was no &#39;holocaust&#39; in New Zealand, what the hell are you talking about? </p>

<p>For reading of Maori, &#39;wh&#39; makes an fff sound, I makes an ee sound and A is an ah with O making an oh sound and U making an ew sound.</p>

<p>Relations with Maori were relatively good, and European sailors regularly traded with Maori. Yes there  was early instanced of violence and death from these meetings, but they went both ways.</p>

<p>Early settlers and missionaries trade for the land they settled by the respective tribes who you could considered &#39;owed&#39; the land. Though early Maori didn&#39;t really believe in ownership as we do today, more of a custodianship that was scared, and the protection of land for future generations, tribal boarders were constantly changing as Maori culture was one of inter-tribal warfare and had been their custom for a long time before settlers arrived.</p>

<p>In <strong>1820</strong>, Hongi Hika was given gifts by King George IV, for the help of spreading Christianity through  New Zealand. Medicine that the missionaries bought with them were embraced by the Maori, Christianity was similar to their already exiting spiritualism - it wasn&#39;t spread at the barrel of a musket. The missionaries also gave the Maori a written form of their language that previously was only oral.</p>

<p>Hongi Hika traded the gifts he received from King Gorge IV for muskets on his return to New Zealand in  Australia. Hongi Hika then went to war with a neighbouring iwi (people/tribe) Te Morenga. Maori were a  tribal culture that were constantly at war with one another for dominance and land, as was their custom.  </p>

<p>Homgi Hika&#39;s men killed around 5,000 and enslaved many more for their neighbouring tribe. After <strong>1835</strong> around 900 Maori boated to the Chatham Islands once again with the guns and modern weapons such as metal axes and essentially wiped out the Moriori, who they declared their slaves, even after that Morior, who were pacifists, attempted to share their resources and work with their related cousins, the Maori. The Maori refused, the men women and children who weren&#39;t taken as slaves were eaten, even children. </p>

<p>One of the Maori commented: &#39;We took possession …in accordance with our customs and we caught all the people. Not one escaped. Some ran away from us. These we killed, and others we killed – but what of that? It was in accordance with our custom.&#39;</p>

<p>The British preferred a peaceful arrangement with the Tangata Whenua (indigenous people, Maori) and the treaty of Waitangi was signed on the <strong>6th of February 1840</strong>, by the crown and 46 Maori Chiefs. The Crown continued to collect signatures, including in the South Island, which had a very small population of Maori, some Chiefs refused but by <strong>May 21st</strong> more than 100 Chiefs has signed.</p>

<p>New Zealand’s immigration and economy grew for the next nineteen years. However Maori unrest grew in the Taranaki region as Maori became unhappy with the amount of land was being sold to settlers and less settlers were trading with Maori as they were becoming self sufficient. This came to a boiling point when the New Zealand’s government attempted to force a land sale in Waitara region, and the second New Zealand war erupted. </p>

<p>The Maori Chiefs again split in opinion, but many remained allied with the British. The Chiefs that did not side with the British were advocates of preserving Maori identity and self rule. The ‘rebel’ Maori fought against a force of roughly 5000 British regulars, settlers and Maori loyalists. The continued war started to depress industry and New Zealand’s economy, so  In <strong>1866</strong> the British withdrew their forces (also, they were getting pretty badly beaten by what is considered today as ‘Gorilla tactics’ that the British army didn’t really have a strategy to match). </p>

<p>The war continued till <strong>1872</strong> when the war ended, the ‘rebel’ Maori dead since 1895 was more than 2000 with around 560 British killed and 250 kupapa (loyal) Maori. Since around 2012 The Office of Treaty and Settlements New Zealand has settled more than $950 Million <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Waitangi_claims_and_settlements#List_of_Treaty_Settlements">list of treat settlements</a>, with more to come. A lot of this money has been invested into sustainable business, such a fisheries, tourism, forestry, hotels, shopping malls, and dairy to name a few as well as various plots of land that the Crown will rent in perpetuity.</p>

<p>In New Zealand, our national anthem is bi-lingual, and both the English and Maori version are sung back to back, public schools teach all children Te Reo Maori, with most New Zealanders knowing basic words in Maori and how to read Te Reo Maori. There are always special cultural classes, Kaupapa Maori (platform/base of Maori language) and Kapa Haka (Maori performing arts) classes in every public school and any child can attend to attain a greater understanding and appreciation for Maori culture. </p>

<p>Most schools have their own Haka (essentially a preformed challenge, if you’ve ever seen the All Blacks play, each school region will tend to have its own version of that) and their own Powhiri (welcome ceremony) students generally take great pride when performing it as it is part of our cultural identity. There are special grants for Maori students to attending tertiary education often with most school having reserved spots for Maori students. There are special tuition classes that go side by side at primary, secondary and tertiary schools that give Maori and culturally rich environment in which they can learn in. </p>

<p>Maori have their own political party and guaranteed seats for representation in parliament. They have their own sports teams, TV and radio stations. We also have many, many Maori and Pacific Islands festivals in which New Zealand celebrates Maori and our greater Pacific Island neighbors who can immigrate to New Zealand whenever they want with permanent residence and apply for citizenship without question.   </p>

<p>Did the original colonial people do everything right by the Maori? No, not by a long shot, but to compare it even slightly to what happened in Australia to the Aboriginals is belittling to what the Aboriginals suffered, and what they suffered was great. Also, but no means could you even come close to describing it as a holocaust. New Zealand has been working hard, with critical self reflection and improvement since 1840 when the treaty was first signed. The date of the treaty is a national holiday in New Zealand and Maori culture and largely identified with Kiwi culture, even if you’re Pākehā (of European decent, fair-skinned).</p>

<p>Sorry this is so large, but it’s not accurate, or fair to throw New Zealand in the same category by any means as Australia and American natives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mr. Cole,</p>

<p>since you&#39;re new to reddit, allow me to explain this situation to you.</p>

<p>Admins are paid employees of reddit INC</p>

<p>The mods, like me, are volunteers of the SUB-reddits like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>The Admins have shadowbanned these users for presumably violating reddits ToS agreement.  most likely because they are just one person pretending to be a dozen unique people and voting for themselves while down voting people they don&#39;t want heard.</p>

<p>sorry if this is confusing.  Basically these users want this community to remove me as a volunteer mod because i refuse to ban people like you that they consider to be racist or antisemitic.</p>

<p>cheers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;ll go this far. I don&#39;t believe in a double-standard. If the rights of &quot;indigenous people&quot; are enforced in Africa, they should be enforced in Europe as well, as whites are the indigenous folks of that land. I don&#39;t mean creating a &quot;racial state,&quot; but I do believe that Europeans have the same right as Africans to preserve their culture. Indigenous is indigenous, right? On the other hand, America&#39;s greatness is in its diversity (shit, I know that sounds so damn cliche, but I believe it). I like that about my country. I like the fact that no one is truly indigenous (even the damn Indians, although we&#39;re never supposed to admit that). </p>

<p>I&#39;m not really what you would call a fan, I wasn&#39;t even familiar with your works before my fellow mods managed to set this AMA up with you so my question is not going to be about the Holocaust directly.</p>

<p>I take a lot of flak for refusing to silence users of this subreddit who express unpopular opinions and beliefs.  I feel like it does society a disservice to pressure people out of opinions or silence them directly.</p>

<p>I took a lot of flak for defending this AMA, so that it could take place.</p>

<p>Since you&#39;ve suffered similar defamation from both sides of the Holocaust debate, what would your advice be to me, about continuing down this road of protecting free speech in its ugliest forms?</p>

<p>Should I remain anonymous? Should I abandon ship before I get identified?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that most people with intellectual careers are very timid.  There are not a huge number of ways for them to earn as basically they can work for a university or write books.  Working at a university is a cake job that comes with a community of people to associate with and staff parties to be had and writing books is incredibly hard and lonely in comparison.  So if you communicate about something that goes fatally against the orthodoxy then you pretty much need to be acting solo and going direct to consumers to earn a living.  That is a lonely and difficult route and its not just about doing that in a vacuum but groups like the ADL will try to shut you down if you actually manage to have some success in that route.  Another thing about having a university position is that it is very political and for a long haul you need to cover your ass a bit.  Basically even with tenure you will have an ax over your head if you piss them off in this way.  Then people will just be waiting for you to foul up in some other technicality.</p>

<p>&quot;the marginal advantages of the vaccine in children over one year of age have to be offset against adverse effects of the vaccine itself, which are very common indeed and may be followed occasionally by irreversible brain damage, paralysis and mental deficiency. Because of this danger, or for fear of it, many parents and doctors are reluctant to vaccinate their children.&quot;</p>

<p>You see, people, the defenders of the Hoax are backed into a corner and <em>have</em> to make this argument, otherwise the various tests - including one by the Krakow Forensic Institute - would completely demolish the Zyklon-B gas chamber story. The Exterminationists try to say that the gas chambers weren&#39;t exposed to enough cyanide gas for <em>any</em> Prussian Blue (iron-cyanide) to form in the brickwork, compared to the bricks of the delousing chambers which are stained blue to the other side.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Leuchter&#39;s tests - the first - were devised and carried out under serious time constraints. Cole is correct when he says that there are better tests (e.g. Rudolf).</p>

<p>However the Leuchter report doesn&#39;t merely consist of chemical tests, but an expert analysis of the structures and design of the alleged &quot;gas chambers&quot; also. As someone whose small company was the top/only supplier of equipment (and design consultant) to the US states using cyanide gas for executions, Leuchter was uniquely qualified to assess the structures.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve brought that up at least 3 times, and I&#39;ve explained each time why it&#39;s more than likely a hoax. It&#39;s like you just refuse to listen to anything that doesn&#39;t agree with your opinions.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And they&#39;re right. IF you don&#39;t mind me asking, have you even taken a chemistry course? (Ideally an Organic Chemistry course). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>However the Leuchter report doesn&#39;t merely consist of chemical tests, but an expert analysis of the structures and design of the alleged &quot;gas chambers&quot; also.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except that Leuchter was an expert in exactly none of those things.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>In the past, he had been contracted by governmental authorities of several states of the United States to improve the design of instruments for capital punishment,  but no longer does so, primarily because of his lack of any formal engineering experience, but also because of charges of running a &quot;death row shakedown&quot; in which Leuchter threatened to testify for the defense in capital cases if he was not given contracts for his services by the state.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yep, that&#39;s a real expert if I ever saw one.</p>

<p>Yes, we all know Leuchter was persecuted and defamed after he took his stand. Yet he was the number one expert in gas chamber design in the US at the time. Not formally qualified, though, as you point out.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>If there had been more used, and there had been more time for the reaction to complete, you probably would have seen the identical formations as the gas chambers. In fact, this is backed up by the Krakow report, where they found very significant traces of cyanide in both the delousing and gas chambers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Being number one in a field with only yourself is not an amazing achievement.</p>

<p>Which is actually pretty important, especially when it comes to creating complex devices like gas chambers can be.</p>

<p>And? This still doesn&#39;t make him right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi David thanks for taking time to do this. I have a few questions.</p>

<p>Why would the Jews want to inflate holocaust numbers? What are the more closer estimates then the 6 million? Any interesting facts about the Holocaust that is never talked about because it&#39;s negative to Jews?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All wartime casualty numbers need reexamination. 80,000,000 deaths under Mao? 20,000,000 under Stalin? These are estimates, based mainly on demography, not bodies. We are lucky in the case of the Holocaust to have the Korherr Report, ordered by Himmler to provide an exact (or as exact as possible) number for Jewish dead by early 1943. We get a figure of a little under 2.5 million. Add the Jewish deaths from then until 1945, and my rough estimate is 3 million. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done no fact checking but here&#39;s a snippet that gives one possible explanation..</p>

<p>“Jewish prophecies in the Torah require that 6 million Jews must ‘vanish’ before the state of Israel can be formed. ‘You shall return minus 6 million.’ That&#39;s why Tom Segev, an Israeli historian, declared that the ‘sacred 6 million’ is an attempt to transform the holocaust story into state religion… Those six million, according to prophecy, had to disappear in ‘burning ovens,’ which the judicial version of the holocaust now authenticates… ‘Without the Holocaust, there would be no Jewish State.’”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Jews were indeed killed in the &quot;Reinhardt&quot; camps. I think this task was delegated to Himmler, but Hitler approved the broad outline. I doubt he was ever informed about the specifics, though. I don&#39;t buy David Irving&#39;s assertion that Hitler was &quot;in the dark.&quot; I think he approved the general idea, but the specific details were delegated to Himmler, who delegated to Globocnik, etc. </p>

Do you believe that europe is being invaded currently and whites genocided in eu, USA, SA, etc? I&#39;m not pushing this agenda I just want to hear how you argue against it... If you can present any sort of coherent argument I would love to believe these people are wrong but I see no one able to address these big questions taking in all the factors, so decompartmentalized, are you and all this other information not proving that hitler was right about most if not everything?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>David, as you may know, there was an influx of liberal atheists into the ranks of the neoconservative party&#39;s strident propaganda machine post 911.  This happened just in time to push the Iraq and afghanistan invasions on all fronts.  Im talking of people like Christopher Hitchens, and Sam Harris.  Even <a href="http://i.imgur.com/2yBfBQ1.png">Richard Dawkins</a> has jumped on the bandwagon.</p>

<p>These people, except Hitchens (rip), are still used today as leverage to move the maleable young left towards a rightwing agenda, mainly zionism and colonialism in the middle east.  The same could be applied to fence-sitters and holocaust doubters.  Since you became a neocon about the same time they did, do you have any knowledge of what their price might have been, were they blackmailed, or was it just all an incredible coincidence?</p>

<p>Also, what do you think of the Da Vinci code as a manufactured tool of catholicism to validate the existance of Jesus by using controlled opposition?  Creating controversy about the Jesus&#39; story, but at the same time cleverly setting in stone that he actually existed? </p>

<p>See a parallel there, by the way? </p>

<p>Lol. Would it?</p>

<p>Look, clearly you&#39;re convinced it&#39;s a fake. You&#39;re welcome to that opinion. Maybe you need to get in touch with Richard Green or Andrew Mathis (or J. Markiewicz, W. Gubala, J. Labedz, et al!) and point it out to them - perhaps for 23 years they have simply not noticed! :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is that Exterminationists such as Green are now at a point where they <em>accept</em> that the results of Rudolf - and first Polish test - as  correct in not finding iron-cyanide residue in the &quot;gas chambers&quot;.</p>

<p>And they <em>admit</em> in the second test that they specifically excluded testing for iron-cyanide compounds, and attempt to justify that decision. This is the test which you claim &quot;confirms gassings&quot;!</p>
