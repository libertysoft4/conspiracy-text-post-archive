        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I thought I’d try and start a discussion on this, given the current international political climate. I’m also eager to hear views from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as this sub tends to have an alternative world viewpoint to much of the mainstream political commentary. </p>

<p>I for one think it is very unlikely unless certain conditions are met. Namely, the survival of either the Russian state or the US is under threat. 
So unless the US wants to raise the American flag on the Kremlin, or the Russians raising the flag on the White House, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll see anything more than a rehashing of the Cold War. </p>

<p>Even if the US and Russia were to engage militarily with each other somewhere around the planet, I still couldn’t imagine either nations resorting to nuclear weapons unless, as I said above, the survival of either state was threatened. </p>

<p>The logic I’m thinking is that obviously the US would defeat Russia (at least for the foreseeable future), but if Russia can retreat and go home, then they can rebuild (it would take them a long time of course). But if they go nuclear, then it’s game over for everyone including them. </p>

<p>I just see nuclear weapons as the ultimate last option, when a nation’s very existence is directly under threat.</p>

<p>I know that users here and elsewhere tend to view the elite as literally insane from time to time, but Putin and Obama or any future US president, or if you are of that persuasion the shadow elite pulling the strings, they are not idiots. They know what they are doing and both sides must recognize the utter strategic pointlessness of launching a nuclear attack at each other.  </p>

<p>Agree? Disagree? All views and opinions welcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;m interpreting it as is the <em>financiers</em> of the governments have no incentive in a thermonuclear holocaust.</p>

<p>They have far more invested in <em>the perpetual fear</em> that the threat implies. Because they make money off of the <em>fear</em>, for planes, missiles, defense systems, etc.</p>

<p>I am as close to voting 0% as possible here, but respect all of your opinions.</p>

<p>I am not old enough to have experiences the last Cold War drama, and am sorry for those here who have. Just trying to offer a level headed response here (something I wish our media would do for once, and considering I usually take the opposite stance of them, I feel alright so far as far as my position goes).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sure as hell fits their fearporn Problem/Reaction/Solution paradigm though, which is why I&#39;m not buying any of this bullshit.</p>

<p>Just gotta keep your eyes on the prize, BM, and do what you think is right. A little stockpile never hurt anyone, even if it&#39;s more for peace-of-mind than anything.</p>

<p>Keep learning, keep searching for Truth, and try and convince your friends and family to turn off that fucking TV and go live their lives. Hit a baseball, climb a mountain, restore and old car, brew some goddamn beer (and don&#39;t forget about Jim, he&#39;s always thirsty).</p>

<p>We&#39;ve lost sight of that with all our electronic gadgets, and I think it&#39;s a shame. And full disclosure, I&#39;m typing this from my Nexus 5, so of course I&#39;m a bit guilty. But you gotta pay attention to the <em>real world</em> far more than all the fearporn out there.</p>

<p>I have a bug out bag for &quot;regular&quot; emergencies, and when I was younger I worried enough I settled in a place likely to miss the majority of the fall out. As projections predicted then. But as I grew older I realized it was just a crapshoot and if I get lucky, I get lucky. </p>

<p>Smaller tactical nuclear strikes leads us to a different conversion. Where would they be used? By whom? And why would a nation feel compelled to use them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, definitely, I was young and impressionable at the time though. Once I later realised the whole thing was a theater of control it turned the nihilistic edge I gained into a healthy hatred of false party politics and an awareness of the bullshit we are fed by the corporate classes.

    <div class="md"><p>Well I suspect that tensions between Russia and the US are going to get a lot worse. Now, they may get better in the near future, but eventually they are going to see days as bad as the height of the Cold War, I&#39;d assume so anyway. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m really interested in the though, is the likelihood of firstly, a military conflict between the two nations (as the US and Russia never actually confronted each other during the Cold War), and secondly, the likelihood of a nuclear confrontation. </p>

<p>A rehashing of the Cold War wouldn&#39;t concern me greatly, I wouldn&#39;t live in fear because of it as I don&#39;t believe that either side would launch a nuclear attack against one another. Again, unless certain conditions are met, as I have written above. </p>

<p>Perhaps I&#39;ll keep my head buried in the sand and pass on this one. </p>

<p>Or maybe I&#39;ll watch it tomorrow, it&#39;s unlikely though. Sorry. </p>

<p>Unless It&#39;s on about how nuclear weapons are in existence purely for propaganda purposes to keep nations in fear? In which case, I understand and probably watch it. </p>

<p>But if it&#39;s literally going to make the argument that nuclear weapons don&#39;t exist and have never gone off (Hiroshima and testing etc), then I refer you back to my first two points. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one benefits from an actual nuclear exchange. Ruins your human resources when you do that. </p>

<p>The <em>existence of nukes</em> is enough to keep the slaves in line, and that&#39;s been proven for over 60 years now. Sadly, this will not prevent either side from asserting that a nuke can/will/has been used. They may even go as far as to let a &#39;dirty&#39; nuke irradiate an area to prove they are being &#39;used&#39;. </p>

<p>But an actual, mutually assured destruction phase? Nah. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so if an exchange of nuclear weapons occurs, as you believe will happen in this century between the US and Russia, then It&#39;ll be all out nuclear annihilation. You can guarantee that Russia will use all of its second strike capabilities once Moscow is no more, which will mean much of North America and Europe will be wiped out, if not all of it in its entirety. </p>

<p>So the very few privileged elite will be hiding away in their nuclear bunkers/command centres whilst quite literally the rest of America burns and turns into a fiery living hell. </p>

<p>So what does the very few remaining elite do after it&#39;s all over and there is <strong>nothing</strong> left. Build a bonfire and start rebuilding America with their bare hands? </p>
