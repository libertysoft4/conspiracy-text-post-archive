    <div class="md"><p>People probably think you were trolling or trying to disrupt.  It&#39;s hard to tell intent from 3 words, but some probably saw it as a &quot;u mad bro?&quot;</p>

<p>To answer your question, I am mad.  The more important question is are you mad enough to risk your home, family, job, or your life?  I cannot say that I am there yet.  I think most people who can read the writing in the wall are stuck in a difficult place.  We are told that half the country doesn&#39;t care about torture, and judging by the attitudes expressed in reddit, it&#39;s probably true.  We watch the encroaching police state while most people respond with &quot;hurrdurr tin foil hattery&quot;.  Eventually the reality of the situation will be obvious, right about the time you can&#39;t get a pizza delivered.....</p>

<p>Look, I know the media works to propagate a pro government narrative most of the time, but journalists framing the debate on whether torture worked or not isn&#39;t the same thing as <em>defending</em> it.

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you.  This is what I&#39;m taking about.  I still don&#39;t think it proves Shields, Brooks, Woodruff or PBS are defending torture though.</p>

<p>Both Shields and Brooks acknowledge that &quot;torture&quot; is the word for it, not Enhanced Interrogation Techniques (ETI) and condemn the act as deplorable. </p>

<p>Brooks even points out how complicit congress and the White House were in signing off on those torture practices, and even mentioned how often the US kills people with drones.  </p>

<p>I disagree with Shields that &quot;this is not who we are&quot; when history would clearly prove otherwise and I certainly don&#39;t agree with Brooks&#39; caveat at the end that &quot;those moral calculus should not be legalized except for in extreme cases.&quot;  However, I do not think this example proves journalists are defending the act of torture.</p>
