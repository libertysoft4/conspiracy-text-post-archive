        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://gizadeathstar.com/2014/12/giants-earth-except-smithsonian/">From Joseph P. Farrell</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This last week I received a bunch of articles from many people about giants, and this is a subject intriguing to me personally, since I wrote a whole book on the subject (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Genes-Giants-Monsters-Men-Surviving/dp/1936239086/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1419179484&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=gene%27s+giants+monsters+men">Genes, Giants, Monsters, and Men</a>), and have included discussions about giants in other books as well, and yes, to set the record straight and to let everyone know where I am coming from, I am one of those who does think there’s been an institutional and academic coverup of the issue, though at the time I wrote Genes, Giants, Monsters, and Men, the evidence was not to the state it is now. </p>

<p>The evidence suggestive – though in my opinion still not compellingly so – that such a coverup exists, has grown a bit. But it has grown to the point that a coverup looks more likely, as does the possibility of deliberate suppression and even destruction, of the evidence.</p>

<p>First, here’s the story that caught my interest, in the many giant-related articles I received:</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://earthweareone.com/the-great-smithsonian-cover-up-18-giant-skeletons-discovered-in-wisconsin/">The Great Smithsonian Cover-Up: 18 Giant Skeletons Discovered in Wisconsin</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, there’s not much new here, to those familiar with the “Smithsonian cover-up story,” except I did note this interesting set of information:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“In the words of Vine Deloria, a Native American author and professor of law:</p>

<p>“Modern day archaeology and anthropology have nearly sealed the door on our imaginations, broadly interpreting the North American past as devoid of anything unusual in the way of great cultures characterized by a people of unusual demeanor.</p>

<p>“The great interloper of ancient burial grounds, the nineteenth century Smithsonian Institution, created a one-way portal, through which uncounted bones have been spirited.</p>

<p>“This door and the contents of its vault are virtually sealed off to anyone, but government officials. Among these bones may lay answers not even sought by these officials concerning the deep past.”</p>

<p>“Two Giant Skeletons Near Potosi, WI</p>

<p>“The January 13th, 1870 edition of the Wisconsin Decatur Republican reported that two giant, well-preserved skeletons of an unknown race were discovered near Potosi, WI by workers digging the foundation of a saw mill near the bank of the Mississippi river.</p>

<p>“One skeleton measured seven-and-a-half feet, the other eight feet. The skulls of each had prominent cheek bones and double rows of teeth. A large collection of arrowheads and “strange toys” were found buried with the remains.</p>

<p>“Giant Skeleton Discovered in Maple Creek, WI</p>

<p>“On December 20th, 1897 the New York Times reported that three large burial mounds had been discovered near Maple Creek, WI. Upon excavation, a skeleton measuring over nine feet from head to toe was discovered with finely tempered copper rods and other relics.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now I reported in Genes, Giants, Monsters, and Men about similar New York Times articles, and indeed this very same find. So why am I bothering you with it?</p>

<p>It’s because of this article, which many of you sent me, reported by RT (why is all the good news now being reported by RT?):</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://rt.com/news/215115-egypt-million-mummies-discovered/">Million mummy mystery: Egyptian cemetery with 1mn bodies stumps scientists</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now amid this high strangeness of a vast burial ground of over a million “mummies,” you’ll note three odd things:</p>

<p>1) One “mummy” was of a large male about seven feet tall, a largeheight given the relative “shortness” of people of the era:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“The scientists found one mummy with a height of more than 2 meters, Muhlestein told the audience in Toronto. The mummy was discovered long before Muhlestein became the project director. “We once found a male who was over 7 feet (2.1 meters) tall, who was far too tall to fit into the shaft, so they bent him in half and tossed him in,” he said.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2) Several of the remains were of blonde-haired or red-haired people that appear to be buried in areas specially reserved for blonde-haired or red-haired people:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“According to Muhlestein, the researchers can use the database to “show us all of the blonde burials, and [it shows] they are clustered in one area, or all of the red-headed burials, and [it shows] they’re clustered in another area.” ‘Perhaps we have family areas or genetic groups [in certain areas], but we’re still trying to explore that,” he added.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But perhaps we have burials together for a different reason, and here comes the first part of today’s high octane speculation, for as readers here who are familiar with the “lore of giants,” these are often described are blonde- or red-haired; and hence, might these burial sites represent a burial for a population viewed by the rest of the people burying them as a cursed, or at least “quarantined” population? </p>

<p>Of course, this is pure speculation because there is absolutely nothing in the article that suggests that these people are of above average height, though it would be interesting to find out if the male over seven feet tall was.</p>

<p>3) The third odd thing to be noted – and with it, the other half of our high octane speculation – is that much of the excavation is being conducted in conjunction with Brigham Young University in Utah, which is, of course, a Mormon-influenced institution. Giants are referred to in the Book of Mormon, and, if I understand Mormon doctrine correctly, Mormons view these giants as the offspring, not of fallen angels, but rather of men that achieved deification. As such, their relics would, presumably, be treated with some reverence.</p>

<p>So what does this have to do with the Great Smithsonian Giant Cover-up? Well, permit me to conclude my high octane speculation by sharing what I have long held as a kind of private hypothesis, which I share now. </p>

<p>There has been a kind of love-hate relationship between Mormonism and the US government, a relationship that in the 1800s was more one of mutual hostility, that by the 1900s became more one of mutual interest. </p>

<p>Thus, I have long suspected that if there was a quiet, covert cover-up of archaeological “difficulties” like giants, while the government continued to quietly pursue and research the matter, then this cover-up and quiet pursuit would, like other types of black projects, be shifted to cut-outs like religious groups with a natural interest in the matter… like the Mormons, who also maintain keen interest in genealogies, a huge genealogical database in Utah….</p>

<p>…and let’s not forget the NSA’s huge data processing center also located in that state either…</p>

<p>It does make you wonder…</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To play Devil&#39;s Advocate here, we know there were giants on the earth at one point. They were called  dinosaurs. They disappeared, not because an astroid his the earth and killed them all, but because the atmosphere of the earth changed. When the dinosaurs lived two hundred million years ago, the air was thicker, and it contained a higher level of free oxygen. These differences enabled the existence of huge, flying creatures, and enormous dinosaurs, that simply could not function or survive in our atmosphere.</p>

<p>So, let&#39;s suppose there were &quot;men&quot; of some kind back when the air was thicker and richer. Maybe not men like us, maybe a different species that still walked upright, had hands, and large brains. It&#39;s not hard to imagine that they would have been much larger than we are. The air back then would have enabled that greater size, which today seems so amazing when  we look at the dinosaurs. Let&#39;s suppose their had an advanced civilization, but it was entirely wiped out in some disaster, so that only a few skeletons (perhaps) remained. It&#39;s not beyond the bounds of reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still believe biblical/mythological accounts of giants are probably legends of the extinct homo erectus. They stood at about 6 feet, taller and larger body mass than other hominis (including sapiens). Considering their coexistance with us (and possibly even merged evolution), would make sense of &quot;giants&quot; in ancient legends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In more recent history, cultures around the world have tales of such intelligent giants. Because of my interest in the subject, I&#39;m most familiar with the story of the Sioux wanting passage through a land of giants. The giants were arrogant and denied them but, relying on being intimidating, were easily overtaken by the aggressive tribe. It&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve read about it so I don&#39;t remember the exact particulars but it was an interesting story. It could also be older than what we consider memorable history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to believe another theory and that&#39;s that the Earth was smaller back then and as it grew the ever increasing gravity forced evolution to pop out smaller creatures. The way how all the continents fit to each other if moved to a clump is mind blowing. Not only do they fit on one side, but at all sides. I just can&#39;t believe that the Earth was not smaller way back then. Perhaps not the reason dinosaurs got extinct, but anyhow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The worst part is that it was never about ratings for the History channel. They didn&#39;t need extra revenue. Reality TV spiked, so they added the &quot;history&quot; and/or &quot;natural&quot; flair to it, and those same exact people that watch the Kardashians flocked right over- provided it doesn&#39;t interfere with the gladiators. Er, I mean football season.</p>

<p>This all of course ties in to the general idea that the U.S. government or whatever foreign entity (be it a shadow government or legitimate foreign country ruining us from the inside) is purposely dumbing down the average American. I actually met someone recently whose kid is in a school where they use Common Core. I talked to him, he&#39;s a smart kid, and advanced in every class but math, which is weakest subject in Common Core. So he has a tutor, who teaches him how to do math the correct way, and done- not straights A&#39;s, but B+s, because you can&#39;t really teach an 11-year-old how to deal with a Common Core word problem mindfucks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What solid or real evidence is there to giants. Sure the bible talks about one or some yet at colleges they say it is impossible for there to be 10&#39; +beings in existence. So what is the real truth and should I believe anthropologists and biologists and such that say that such a life form can&#39;t exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gigantopithecus might have stood about 10 feet tall but it&#39;s known only from jawbones, as far as I know. I don&#39;t think a 10 foot humanoid is impossible, the problem is that there&#39;s a lack of evidence, combined with shoddily fabricated evidence. I disbelieve in the existence of the American giant skeletons because all we have are century-old newspaper clippings and accusations that the Smithsonian or government took the skeletons away. Surely someone would have found more skeletons by now in the 20th and 21st centuries and got the word out, with some photos, to local newspapers before the government could get at them if the giants were real. And I don&#39;t really see what anyone&#39;s motivation would be to cover something like this up. </p>
