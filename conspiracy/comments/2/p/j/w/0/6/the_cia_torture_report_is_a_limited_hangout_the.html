<p>^ &gt;I am now convinced that Snowden is part of a &quot;limited hangout&quot; operation, and here&#39;s why. (If you downvote, please explain in comments, because I put in some effort into this)  </p>

<p>garnered 111 points</p>

<p>Now: </p>

<p>Consider <strong>if</strong> Snowden&#39;s documents are limited hangout</p>

<p><strong>Do you think the MSM would cover him if he wasn&#39;t?</strong> [Operation Mockingbird = They control anything and everything the MSM/Corporate Media tells you. <em>EVERYTHING</em>] </p>

<p><strong>Argument</strong>- they were forced to cover snowden, too big of a story</p>

<p><strong>Response</strong>- Ok.... but you think TPTB would put him on the cover of TIME, or on 60 minutes, or fly Brian Williams to Russia to interview him?</p>

<p>No, because TPTB want you to know about Snowden</p>

<p><strong>Question- why?</strong></p>

<p>Because they want the following: <em>spread fear, control dissent</em></p>

<p>1) chilling effect on the people</p>

<p>2) scare potential whistle-blowers ( snowden sets an example that you get charged with the espionage act)</p>

<p>3) scare journalists ( they dont want them covering corruption/the elite)... [michael hastings death is the opposite of a limited hangout, they want us to know they killed him, they wanted it to be obvious so that <strong>WE KNOW</strong> they can do something like that and get away with it</p>

<p>IMO -- In my opinion, the whole reason behind this would be to let us know we are being watched. </p>

<p>Snowden&#39;s cache being limited hangout was a very serious and risky operation intended to create the <strong>PANOPTICON</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon</a></p>

<p>They did the Snowden false flag to scare people, fear fear fear</p>

<p>very simple.</p>

<p><a href="http://foucault.info/documents/disciplineandpunish/foucault.disciplineandpunish.panopticism.html">when people know they are being watched, they alter their behavior

<p>They even go on to quote a deputy director of the CIA&#39;s Counterterrorism Center, &quot;we either get out and sell, or we get hammered, which has implications beyond the media... we either put out our story or we get eaten. [T]here is no middle ground.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is just intuitive that any &quot;report&quot; about secret US government operations especially, (but not limited to) snoop organizations is going to be a &quot;limited hangout&quot;. </p>

<p>Anything that they would &quot;voluntarily&quot; turn over to the public would be done for them not the citizenry. </p>

<p>And the only reason that any &quot;secrets&quot; of Deep Government operations are ever released, is because the top people view not releasing them to be more dangerous than doing so.</p>
