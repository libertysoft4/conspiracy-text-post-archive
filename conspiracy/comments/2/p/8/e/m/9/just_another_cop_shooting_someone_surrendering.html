<p>Might be worthwhile to Know the <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2014/11/linfield_college_student_stabb.html">context</a> behind this story. </p>

<p>However, even though <a href="http://www.newsregister.com/111714-linfield-student-memorial">3 officers fired</a> over 12 rounds into the suspect, the shooting was still ruled <a href="http://www.newsregister.com/linfield-police-shooting-decision">justified</a>.</p>

<p>This may just be another theory, but haven&#39;t we seen enough &quot;justifiable&quot; killing done by the police lately? </p>

<p>For those of you who want the <strong>tldr</strong> version of the story:</p>

<pre><code>College student is at 7-11 Convenience store. 
Hispanic male randomly stabs college student multiple times in the chest.
Store clerk calls 911.
Police respond, suspect shows back up to the store.
Police draw guns, suspect puts hands in air, but fails to respond to police (likely due to language barriers).
Police fire multiple shots into suspect.
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<p>Later: Police are put on paid leave. Reports come out of the suspect having a knife in his hands. Shooting ruled justifiable.</p>

<p>Edit: Added tldr version to original comment.</p>

<p>Edit2: NSFW tag added for anyone who wants to watch the video.</p>

<p>Indeed they were...and yet what I said still very much stands, unfortunately.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>He had his hands up, and did not have a gun in either one of them.  He (according I guess to what the report or whatever said)  had a knife in one of them (though I couldn&#39;t see any such thing - possibly due to the grainy quality of the video).  He made exactly no effort to even attempt to throw that knife (since his hands were, again, up), which would have been the only real way he could have caused anyone around him further harm.</p>

<p>So now...how exactly was he a threat to any of the police officers that were standing with guns drawn and pointed about 10-15 feet away from him?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lethal force is allowed in this scenario.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t actually seem to qualify in the area of &quot;genuine threat&quot; - not with two or three cops that all have their guns drawn on him.  Let&#39;s be realistic here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One might argue that should change, but it is the way it is now.</p>

<p>I guess what I&#39;m saying is that even within the context of the existing code, these people acted more like...well, a bunch of frightened, untrained, not very intelligent goons.</p>

<p>In your mind, perhaps.</p>

<p>However, these decisions are made by courts, and you&#39;ll need to examine how the courts handle these cases to reach an understanding of how this will be handled.</p>

<p>The standard is &#39;objectively reasonable&#39;, and the analysis is applied from the point of view of the officer.</p>

<p>The primary areas of consideration are:</p>

<li><p>the threat the suspect poses (returned to the scene, with the weapon, intention unclear)</p></li>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m in no way talking about how the courts or the &quot;system&quot; handles these types of situations.  I know exactly how they&#39;re handled.  That in no way makes them valid, however.  I&#39;m, again, talking about and making mention of what the objective facts revolving around the situation were.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The standard is &#39;objectively reasonable&#39;, and the analysis is applied from the point of view of the officer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that it&#39;s applied from the p.o.v. of the officer does not take away from the fact that someone standing 10-15 feet away from the cops with their hands up - even if they happen to be holding a knife - is zero match for and zero threat to two or three cops with guns drawn pointed at the individual in question.  It&#39;s a bit of a common sense thing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Of course the cops walk.  It&#39;s never been may argument whether the cops do or don&#39;t.  They will absolutely walk.</p>

<p>We&#39;re not talking about that, however - or at least I&#39;m not nor have I ever been.  I&#39;m talking about whether or not the cops in question did or did not appear/act like brainless buffoons with guns.</p>

<p>I would say they absolutely did.</p>

<p>They did what they are trained to do.</p>

<p>There is this strange logic floating around that these cops are somehow breaking policy or law. In fact, they are doing what they are trained to do with the confidence that the courts will not hold them accountable.</p>

<p>So, again, the answer is YES.  They <em>did</em> indeed appear/act like brainless buffoons with guns.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is this strange logic floating around that these cops are somehow breaking policy or law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can see how many would think this, but I don&#39;t now, and never did.  They ultimately did nothing really against their policy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just that their policy is caustic and sucks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, they are doing what they are trained to do with the confidence that the courts will not hold them accountable.</p>

<p>100% correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a nutshell, they are doing what we pay them to do.</p>

<p>Also correct, unfortunately (UNFORTUNATELY).</p>

<p>They are armed and extremely dangerous.</p>

<p>Suspects can easily withstand a fully charged taser, especially if they&#39;re on drugs or the officer missed. Suspect had plenty of time from getting hit with the taser to going down to lunge at the officer with the knife. </p>

I can easily withstand a kick to my balls if you mean i&#39;ll probably be alive afterwards, disregarding the &quot;writhing on the ground in pain&quot; part.</p>

<p>The reason <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taser">tasers were introduced in the first place is to help subdue a suspect non-lethally</a>. There may be some people who are able to withstand the shock of this for whatever reason, but who&#39;re you kidding. <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2014/08/28/5134946/jury-finds-charlotte-police-officer.html#.VI3_CivF_5E">Tasers are still potentially deadly</a>.. <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/consumer-electronics/gadgets/how-a-taser-works">Another article questioning taser safety</a>. If you&#39;re unsure how tasers work, know that a <a href="http://www.hubbellpowersystems.com/literature/encyclopedia-grounding/pdfs/07-0801-02.pdf">current runs through your body and, depending how strong, not only inflicts pain but can cause effects ranging from a slight tingling to loss of muscle control, even to death</a>. </p>

<p>To choose to use live rounds or a taser, each presents its own dangers. After this quick search, I&#39;m kinda questioning the use of a taser now too. Thinking why not tranquilizers? Truth is all these methods to subdue can be potentially dangerous because it&#39;s already in a dangerous situation. But, a taser&#39;s purpose is to stop non-lethally so they can be tried and punished if guilty. I can&#39;t imagine how &quot;simple&quot; it would be stop a person by shooting him non-lethally.</p>

<p>I do agree though that while watching that video (cannot confirm if he actually had knife in hand or is agitated) it felt completely possible for the suspect to lunge as he was shuffling forward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have no idea what the 21ft rule means.  That is only used in cases where cops are surprised with guns holstered.  21ft rule does not mean shit when cops are drawn and approaching the guy.  This is a perfect case for using a taser, you have multiply cops with guns already drawn, one should of called for &#39;tazer&#39; while others keep their guns on suspect.  This is the exact scenarios that where talked about when tazers where being implemented into the police force.  They are meant to be used only as alternatives to lethal threat.  Not as they are used today as ways to subdue unarmed people.  You can read official forums on the 21ft rule and why you are the mouth breather who doesnt know what it is about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok: In the time it takes to realize an imminent threat of death, decide to shoot, raise a gun, aim, squeeze the trigger without jerking or pushing the gun off target, an attacker can run 21 ft and slash you. The 21ft rule is, if your attacker is over 21 ft away, you can negotiate. Under 21 ft, you will be cut to ribbons before you can react.  </p>

<p>The &quot;another innocent stabber&quot; is a poke at all of the outrage against cops for hurting or killing criminals that have just killed or robbed innocent people, like Mike Brown. There are plenty of examples of police killing really innocent people, like Eric Garner, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be what we focus on. This video is about a guy (allegedly) stabbing an innocent college student, then getting shot by police. Forgive me if I don&#39;t shed a tear for the stabber. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. The guy is already known to have used the knife. There are 3 things cops must know/see before they can use deadly force. The suspect not obeying commands is Intent. Despite the language barrier. Really... if you can&#39;t understand that the police are in front of you, guns pointed, then they have to think something is up. 
Another thing is the weapon, a knife is really easy to hide and he just used it to stab someone!! So they have to assume Capability. That he has the weapon on him. 
Lastly, a knife is considered dangerous from up to 21 feet away. Why that much I don&#39;t know but we get these policies because someone somewhere has done some crazy shit to make it that way. But anways, the officers were most likely less that 21 feet away. Giving them the last part, Opportunity. 
Sounds fucked up but that&#39;s really the way a case is considered justified or not. Despite this and that and the humane thing to do and yadda yadda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea with the camera being that far away you can&#39;t really tell what&#39;s going by his side where the officer is. Hopefully more videos will appear but as for the justifications, they still remain. Without proper video showing that he didn&#39;t even move or he was rebalancing or something along the lines of that then they can say whatever they want to save themselves. Im not saying that video isn&#39;t proof, it&#39;s just showing a large portion of what&#39;s happening behind that car. I wouldn&#39;t have even shot with a partner that close to the guy.

no red box either, there is a pay phone and empty wall space.</p>

<p>The 21ft rule is a worst case scenario but counts when the gun is holstered. It&#39;s 21 because it&#39;s believed an attacker can sprint 21 feet and stab the officer quicker than an officer can draw, ready the weapon and fire</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if someone handed you a knife and said here take it to the cashier as you claimed could have happened, would you not put the knife down after having guns pointed at you? </p>

<p>Even if you had no idea what they where saying? Instead you take a few steps towards them.</p>

<p>It sucks someone had to die, but someone with a knife in the area already stabbed someone and now here is someone with a knife, not responding to officers commands and moving  like he may come at them. </p>

<p>Suicide by cop is a thing, and yes some cops recently have seemingly gotten away with murder in different situations then this. </p>

<p>The cops can&#39;t tackle or disarm every person in hand to hand combat like you see in the movies. Their actions are supposed to be based on the suspects. Suspect hold weapon still and advances towards officers that is seen as a lethal action and met with a lethal action. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not cheering them on. I think the cop in NY who used the choke hold is more guilty than the 3 officers involved here. </p>

<p>Did all 12 shots hit the guy? 3 officers fired shots that means 4 shots by each. This is not the movies and was in a town where officers do not shoot people all the time. Training for this situation and actually being involved with it are two different things. </p>

<p>OP&#39;s linked article  notes</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Scales said it was the first officer-involved shooting since he joined the department 21 years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“They were talking in the parking lot to a witness, and he pointed and said, ‘There he is right there,’” Svenson said. “The officers commanded him to show his hands, and he presented a knife. That’s what resulted in him being shot.”</p>

<p>The investigation includes a review of both interior and exterior surveillance video, plus interviews with members of the Moore and Bermudez-Arenas families, people who were at the store at the time and the police and fire personnel who responded, Svenson said.</p>

<p>He said members of the Bermudez-Arenas family were being cooperative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, unfortunately. I&#39;m a big supporter of the judicial system and fair trials, but if someone is being harmed by someone else for whatever reason, it&#39;s your duty and right to use whatever tools you have available at that moment to stop them from doing that, even if it involves lethal force. You can&#39;t wait for a trial to decide if it&#39;s okay to shoot or not, cause then the victim would already be dead.</p>

<p>The jury of his peers bit is supposed to be the time when it&#39;s determined if self-defense was justified or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch the video again. He&#39;s definitely shifting weight between either foot. Look closer.He is approaching the officers, even if with tiny steps. If the guy really did refuse to drop the knife, with that approach, it can sound reasonable.</p>

<p>But, I also have a bunch of questions. There were three officers, one suspect. The third officer who ran out the store and around the car, he couldn&#39;t come up from behind with a surprise takedown? They couldn&#39;t have confronted the suspect from a slightly further distance if they felt endangered? Why did the officer in front also advance towards the &quot;armed&quot; suspect? What would qualify as a threatening advance?</p>

<p>In fact, what can be considered threatening behavior? Was it a threat when Eric Garner mustered the words &quot;I can&#39;t breathe&quot;? Was it life endangering when <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/25/justice/south-carolina-trooper-shooting/">Levar Jones</a> reached for his license? Was it absolutely traumatic for the trooper when <a href="http://www.policestateusa.com/2014/robert-leone/">Robert Leone</a> &quot;broke a trooper&#39;s fist with his face&quot;? </p>

<p>While each case comes with its own intricacies, whether justifiable or not, if the police believe you to be guilty, there is no guarantee for the preservation of your life, even if you are innocent. </p>

<p>is not unarmed combat and disarming an assailant mandatory training for an officer? after watching i would guess they skipped that for more gun training &gt;_&gt;</p>

<p>The 21ft rule is a worst case scenario but counts when the gun is holstered. It&#39;s 21 because it&#39;s believed an attacker can sprint 21 feet and stab the officer quicker than an officer can draw, ready the weapon and fire</p>
