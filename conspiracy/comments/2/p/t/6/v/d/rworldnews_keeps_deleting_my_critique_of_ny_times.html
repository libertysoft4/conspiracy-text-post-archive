<p>Original article on <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> here:</p>

<p>My reply that keeps getting deleted is this:</p>

<hr/>

<p>Blatant propaganda, just like the last time:</p>

<p><a href="http://truth-out.org/news/item/24817-nyt-dishes-more-ukraine-propaganda">http://truth-out.org/news/item/24817-nyt-dishes-more-ukraine-propaganda</a></p>

<p>They&#39;re back with bizzaro claims. This is insulting to our intelligence.</p>

<p>Interestingly enoguh, OP&#39;s article mentions two things:</p>

<p>(1) Albright being instrumental in Kosovo effort.</p>

<p>(2) Fear that Albright wants Russian resources.</p>

<p>Guess what: Albright <em>actually took</em> Kosovo resources. And here to report on this is ... no other that New York Times:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/12/world/europe/americans-who-helped-free-kosovo-return-as-entrepreneurs.html?pagewanted=all">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/12/world/europe/americans-who-helped-free-kosovo-return-as-entrepreneurs.html?pagewanted=all</a></p>

<p>I mean, seriously NY Times. </p>

<p>Can anyone tell me how this is violating any of the <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> guidelines for comment posting? AFAIK, I am not being hateful or bigoted towards anyone. I&#39;m just calling out known liars for their propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider posting this to <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> as well. Also, welcome. </p>

<p>I have to ask why you find it odd that you&#39;re posting here? My assumption is that you&#39;ve been persuaded that we are all anti-semites or something like that. One reason for this is the constant fake accounts that come here and post anti-semitic content. A notable example is the mod of <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>, Bipolarbear0, creating an account and accidentally leaving proof of his real username in the submissions. The account was <a href="/u/interrogatorybunny">/u/interrogatorybunny</a>. </p>

<p>He posted this: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/128s2h/i_noticed_this_today_while_browsing_reddit_seem/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/128s2h/i_noticed_this_today_while_browsing_reddit_seem/</a></p>

<p>If you click the link and then click the actual submission, you can check the link flair and realize he screenshotted it while logged in as Bipolarbear0. A perusal of the other submissions from that account shows it was clearly an attempt at painting this sub as anti-semitic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Much of the time here I feel there is a misconception to newcomers that the sub is anti Jewish,l which is somewhat of a misconception. The prevailing attitude of hostility here in this context is mainly towards the ideology of Zionism and it&#39;s expression through current Israeli policy. These issues are quite aside from antisemitism or animosity towards Jewish people as they&#39;re not mutuality exclusive no matter how hard the main stream news sources push that sentiment.</p>

<p>This is a fringe sub, a lot less so these days but in the same sense it it&#39;s no surprise the extreme right occasionally attempt to co-op threads on such matters. Just see it those schmucks for what they are I guess.</p>

<p>I agree. But put that [idea that there are lizard people] in the context of the world we live in. What percentage of people, globally, believe in a god or some other deity?</p>

<p>There is as much evidence for a god as there is for lizard people as there is for santa claus. Yet, one group you associate as unstable and another you would call &quot;normal&quot;.</p>

<p>If the vast amount of people on the planet are so irrational as to believe in a god with no evidence, then how can you justify dismissing an even smaller group of people on that basis?</p>

<p>If we follow this thought process even further... if we live in a world that is dominated by irrational people, wouldn&#39;t their instinct be to call those who are rational &quot;crazy&quot; because irrationality has been normalized?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trying to win the argument here. I&#39;m just trying to explain that if you get people angry at you, sometimes they sit back for a while and hit you with something they conjured up, such as a coordinated spamming of racist garbage on this sub. &quot;<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is censoring me, let&#39;s attack them.&quot;</p>

<p>On the other hand, you could just let him do his thing as long as he&#39;s not being racist, and as soon as he posts racist garbage, ban it and he will make a new account. </p>

<p>Further, using a similar account name with only 1 digit off proves that he is in fact only one person who is a racist member of this sub. If you ban anything that looks like his account, he will create something that sounds completely different, and the majority of people will think that this is <em>another</em> racist that believes in conspiracy theories, making it seem like there are so many of them. </p>

<p>Just FYI, a couple months ago he was removed from there for censoring people and falsely attacking them as racists <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/17b0my/an_open_letter_to_the_nlw_crew_and_any_other/">(unsurprisingly).</a></p>

<p>In the now-[deleted] body of that post he included a log of when someone called him out in his private IRC network. He explained that being busted by that guy led him to make this confession post.</p>

<p>They just believe that they can sell shit for truth.

<p>I usually don&#39;t like correcting people. Especially when it&#39;s clear what they mean, as it really adds nothing to the conversation. That being said, I wouldn&#39;t want someone reading these get thrown off by a simple typo.</p>
