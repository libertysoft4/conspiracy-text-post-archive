    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a reasonably well educated person and I cannot wrap my head around the Hollywood vs. North Korea fiasco of the last few days. What the hell do these hackers have that is so fucking compelling you embargo a 10 year old claymation, stall a Christmas time block buster, and outright cancel some future steve carrell rerun still in production. 
If he is making threats, what exactly is he saying? Whats his username? How is he communicating with you? Can you publish the communications? Can you provide any evidence which substantiates this threat as legitimate other than sorry please just trust us at our word. 
For some reason, I feel like we are in day 3 of a really hostile takeover of our system by a new player with a ton of leverage over some very powerful people in our country. Don&#39;t even get me started on the timing of these events with the Cuba devolopments. 40 something years and this is the week it drops? Coincidence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well think about it. The majority seems to simply trust that there actually were threats. So you don&#39;t even need to fake any of the evidence. YOu never need any in the first place. After all, you are Sony or X/Y major corporation and thus you can be trusted because you would never lie.
Same goes for the government which of course only works for the greater good of all its citizens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not the fact that we can&#39;t see the film in the theater. We don&#39;t really give a fuck about that. It&#39;s more that by removing it it shows that Nork can bully us around and change things by threatening the citizens of our country (911 style attacks on the theaters). By giving in to them, it sends the message that we won&#39;t stop them when they bully us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. But from the standpoint of the majority of users, they believe it&#39;s true. Me, personally, I am unsure, and theres no major proof to show any reason. But from looking at the frontage, it seems that most redditors believe that Nork hacked sony, and by canceling it in theaters this complies to what they believe are NK&#39;s wishes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok... so here is the thing that you need to do.  Understand that people lie, and then demand proof of their claims if they are to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>You can not allow yourself to be influenced because Anderson Cooper said that a Sony executive something and then Obama commented on it.</p>

<p>That is not proof... the only thing that there is actual proof of is that it is a propaganda film and that Sony was working with the State dept.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, because Reddit is notorious for loving and supporting Dick Cheney and the torture program. /s </p>

<p>There&#39;s so much bitching about short attention spans, and yeah, it is an issue. But I gotta laugh at it in this instance, you people act North Korea is being talked about completely out of the blue, it&#39;s totally not like they make headlines just about every fucking month and have been doing so for decades.</p>

<p>What exactly is your point anyway? People should not to be angry with or focus on anything that doesn&#39;t currently outrage you? Sorry, time didn&#39;t stop in 2003. Lots of other things have happened since then, and lots of things will happen in the future. </p>

<p>Besides, everyone knows that people that wanna talk about the CIA torture program are just trying to distract people from the real NSA issue. /s</p>

<p>And no, I&#39;m not convinced North Korea is responsible. I&#39;m not convinced America is going to use it as pretext for something batshit crazy like attacking them either. I think the most likely outcome is it&#39;ll be used as an excuse to clamp down on internet freedom. In what form, I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>First of all, and I&#39;m not a North Korea sympathizer, is how would any other world leader like President Obama or Israel PM Netanyahu feel if some other country made a comedy film about their assassination?</p>

<p>Second point is that all these people, including Obama are coming out and saying Sony was wrong to cancel the release of the film BUT what if Sony didn&#39;t cancel the movie and then violence DID happen at one or two theaters?  Then Sony would be damned for NOT pulling the movie.  Sony spent millions on The Interview but those millions spent isn&#39;t worth the price of a single human casualty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a different scenario because the terrorist had an intention to hurt people and was at the location wreaking havoc.</p>

<p>The Sony situation is a threat that people will get hurt if that movie is released.  The only time people are going to get hurt is <em>if</em> the movie is released.  </p>

<p>And please answer my question.</p>

<p>How would you feel if you or a loved one got all jacked up while watching The Interview?  Would you say it wasn&#39;t Sony&#39;s fault and let them slide on this one even though they had clear advanced warning that people are going to get hurt if they release that movie?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course I&#39;d be really upset about it, that goes without saying, but secondly I&#39;d be pretty shocked that whoever is behind this is actually serious enough to kill people over it.</p>

<p>I&#39;d realize immediately that North Korea couldn&#39;t possibly be behind it because that would likely be considered an act of war and lead to potentially devastating consequences for them. Nobody doing it &quot;for the lulz&quot; would kill people over it, which rules out most everybody except for state intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>With that level of audacity of whatever intelligence agency allied with the west, well, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d think. I guess I&#39;d lose my last remaining thread of faith in the establishment, which is that they&#39;d show a tiny bit of restraint in carrying out these false flags. Yes, lots of people were killed in 9/11, but there was a &quot;big prize&quot; there. If they started killing people wantonly when it comes to these soft agendas (i.e., not much money or power to be gained, more a psyop) I&#39;d become very concerned indeed that a new precedent had been set.</p>

<p>This is the general consensus but let&#39;s pretend for a moment that it was N. Korea that hacked Sony.  You or me or the general public or Sony or the Govt don&#39;t know <em>for sure</em> if N. Korea is or isn&#39;t going to do something bad if that movie is released.</p>

<p>And let&#39;s pretend that Sony ignored the warning and released the movie and N. Korea did do something horrible where a bunch of innocent people got fucked up.  <strong>EVERYONE</strong> would want the Sony executives heads on a platter.  </p>

<p>Why risk it over a stupid movie?</p>

<p>And how about we cry foul about <strong>Really</strong> being censored by our own government instead of crying about our 1st amendment rights being shot down because a major corp isn&#39;t going to release a lame movie and they&#39;re going to lose all this money.  I could care less about Sony because we got bigger problems on our hands.</p>

I&#39;ve had many friends and acquaintances blame the US for Sony&#39;s decision, a majority of them actually. And there has been way too many posts/threads on reddit in general talking about how big of a coward America is for pulling The Interview when no one is talking about the CIA report. </p>

<p>2) I don&#39;t think blowing the shit out of Al Qaeda really sponsors their acts of terrorism. That and the entire terms of Obama and Bush are riddled with &quot;War on Terror&quot; headlines. The debate of whether America is fighting or funding is neither here nor there, Americans are still aware of the terrorism part. And if we were talking about &quot;here&quot; being <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, i believe the front page news right now indicates that George Clooney is the frontman of the CIA and assisted with some of the acts of torture in his free time.

<p>The point is we should not be extorted in any form nor have our privacy hacked like NK did. The same goes with all the worlds intelligence services including our numb nuts at the NSA. Everyone in each of their country should be afforded to have privacy and not hacked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well think about it. The majority seems to simply trust that there actually were threats. So you don&#39;t even need to fake any of the evidence. YOu never need any in the first place. After all, you are Sony or X/Y major corporation and thus you can be trusted because you would never lie.
Same goes for the government which of course only works for the greater good of all its citizens.</p>

<p>1.) Not many who frequent here were surprised by the findings of the torture report and in fact many of us believe the public got feed a PG-13 version of the report. </p>

<p>2.) No one here believes that what America has been doing for the last 10+ years is &quot;fighting terrorism.&quot; Sponsoring it? probably. Implementing it? absolutely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course I&#39;d be really upset about it, that goes without saying, but secondly I&#39;d be pretty shocked that whoever is behind this is actually serious enough to kill people over it.</p>

<p>I&#39;d realize immediately that North Korea couldn&#39;t possibly be behind it because that would likely be considered an act of war and lead to potentially devastating consequences for them. Nobody doing it &quot;for the lulz&quot; would kill people over it, which rules out most everybody except for state intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>With that level of audacity of whatever intelligence agency allied with the west, well, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d think. I guess I&#39;d lose my last remaining thread of faith in the establishment, which is that they&#39;d show a tiny bit of restraint in carrying out these false flags. Yes, lots of people were killed in 9/11, but there was a &quot;big prize&quot; there. If they started killing people wantonly when it comes to these soft agendas (i.e., not much money or power to be gained, more a psyop) I&#39;d become very concerned indeed that a new precedent had been set.</p>

<p>Wrong. The average person did not.</p>
