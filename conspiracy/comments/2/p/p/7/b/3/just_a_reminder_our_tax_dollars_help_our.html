<p>... our collective complicity....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This cannot be overstated. Think about it.</p>

<p>Every time  &quot;WE&quot; plan to launch an attack against some far-off land, the media goes into a frenzy, &quot;demonizing&quot; the target country, its leaders, its culture, its beliefs and behaviors in order to &quot;justify&quot; what usually amounts to naked aggression on our part.</p>

<p>Well, &quot;we&quot; just demonized ourselves - Americans as a collective&quot; - in the eyes of the world, and we stand to be judged - AS A PEOPLE - for what was done and <em>is being done</em> in our names.</p>

<p>For example, when we launched our assault on Iraq - the public hoodwinked by lies and false pretenses - we killed scores of thousands of innocent Iraqis and destroyed the lives of countless more - what was our &quot;justification&quot;?</p>

<p>A few Quotes from <strong><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/ballot_box/2004/05/rape_rooms_a_chronology.html">Rape Rooms: A Chronology</a> - What Bush said as the Iraq prison scandal unfolded</strong> Salon, 2004:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Iraqi people are now free. And they do not have to worry about the secret police coming after them in the middle of the night, and they don&#39;t have to worry about their husbands and brothers being taken off and shot, or their wives being taken to rape rooms. Those days are over.&quot;—<em>Paul Bremer, Administrator, [Iraq] Coalition Provisional Authority, Sept. 2, 2003</em></p>

<p>&quot;Iraq is free of rape rooms and torture chambers.&quot;—<em>President Bush, remarks to2003 Republican National Committee Presidential Gala, Oct. 8, 2003</em></p>

<p>&quot;There was an announcement by the Iraqi Governing Council earlier this week about the tribunal that they have set up to hold accountable members of the former regime who were responsible for three decades of brutality and atrocities. … We know about the mass graves and the rape rooms and the torture chambers of Saddam Hussein&#39;s regime. … We welcome their decision to move forward on a tribunal to hold people accountable for those atrocities.&quot;—<em>Bush Press Secretary Scott McClellan, White House press briefing, Dec. 10, 2003</em></p>

<p>&quot;<strong>One thing is for certain: There won&#39;t be any more mass graves and torture rooms and rape rooms</strong>.&quot;—<em>Bush, press availability in Monterrey, Mexico, Jan. 12, 2004</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But there <em>were</em> more torture rooms and &quot;rape rooms&quot;, weren&#39;t there, Mr. President?</p>

<p>The only difference is, that &quot;we&quot; were the ones doing the torturing, the murdering and the raping, weren&#39;t we?</p>

<p>So that makes &quot;us&quot; better than Saddam and Uday Hussein... HOW?</p>

<p>If America EVER had a pretense, an illusion of holding the &quot;Moral High Ground&quot;, it&#39;s gone, and if the crimes of Saddam and the Boys justified the COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT of the entire nation of Iraq, where do we, the nation of the United States stand?</p>

<p>Are we guilty as a collective? I suppose that rather depends on how we respond to these ugly revelations AS A PEOPLE. </p>

<p>Will we hold our &quot;leaders&quot; accountable for what was done and no doubt CONTINUES to be done in our name?</p>

<p>If not, then it would seem that we stand guilty as charged, no?</p>

<p>EDIT: Changed &quot;understated&quot; to &quot;overstated&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.</p>

Well, &quot;we&quot; just demonized ourselves - Americans as a collective&quot; - in the eyes of the world, and we stand to be judged - AS A PEOPLE - for what was done and is being done in our names.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if you actually pay attention to the words our &quot;dear leaders&quot; use when they declare war or talk about &quot;foreign intervention&quot;, they constantly use the phrase &quot;the American people&quot; and refer to themselves as &quot;we&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;The American people say, &#39;No more!&#39;&quot;, stuff like that.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think people realize the subtle effect that language has on the human brain and how effective doublespeak really is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If not, then it would seem that we stand guilty as charged, no?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly.  The easy thing to do is to say, &quot;Well, <em>I</em> didn&#39;t ask for it to happen.  The government doesn&#39;t represent <em>me</em>. I didn&#39;t ask for my taxes to be used for that.&quot;  Etc., etc., we can all make excuses for days.</p>

<p>But the point is that it <em>did</em> happen and our taxes <em>were</em> used to fund their war crimes.</p>

<p>If you give a man 50 bucks without knowing what he&#39;ll use it for and you find out later that he used it to rent a hotel room and rape a little girl, are you going to give him 50 bucks the next time he comes asking?</p>

<p>No, unfortunately not.
and as long as people all collectively say &quot;Support the troops&quot; nothing about our direction in this world will change.</p>

<p>Many people disagree with me, and I&#39;ve gotten plenty of downvotes for saying these things. </p>

<p>But politicians send our troops there, our soldiers, our tanks, and jets and missiles. 
It it our troops, the individual, that is the one that pulls the trigger, or pushes the button. </p>

<p>People need to stop thinking in the ways of the collective and think in terms of individuals. </p>

<p>In my opinion, we&#39;re doomed. the public is too brainwashed to question or care about the injustices that we are committing around the world.
People i have shown articles and evidence to about the atrocities we commit turn away, and say shit like &quot;Well, it was just one soldier who did that right? it wasn&#39;t everyone, we need to support the troops.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think people have a realistic understanding of what torture is.  If we substituted the word  &quot;torture&quot; for &quot;rape&quot; people might react a bit different and feel horrified.   It is just a word but it triggers people to the reality of what it is rather than viewing it as an enhanced interrogation technique.</p>

<p>I expect Shoving hummus up rectums is considered sexual assault/rape in some contexts and so this is how it should be described.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the bigger problem is that people read the five second headline, &quot;CIA Torture Report released&quot;, think to themselves, &quot;Hmm... that&#39;s messed up&quot;, and then go about their lives like nothing happened.</p>

<p>Nobody reads the report itself or about the absolutely disgusting and <em>evil shit</em> that was done to these prisoners.  Nobody bothers to consider that this is our government committing crimes against humanity.  Nobody cares that it&#39;s our tax dollars funding atrocities like this.  Nobody stops to <em>think</em>.  Nobody gives a fuck.</p>

<p>Getting hung up on semantics is exactly what we do <strong>not</strong> need to be doing.  Instead of worrying about what to call it, how about we think about what it means for me and you to be helping to pay for the hummus that was stuffed up the ass of someone in order to garner a false confession out of someone who was probably (or at least possibly) innocent.  Call it rape if you want, call it torture, what difference does it make?  It&#39;s a fucking travesty and an abomination and <em>nobody gives a fuck</em>.</p>

<p>And it will keep happening until people start giving a fuck.</p>

<p>I agree with you, but since it has happened throughout recorded human history in every culture, I&#39;m not optimistic that such behavior is going to stop any time in the foreseeable future. All we see now is more propaganda trying to spin such acts as being either justified or less brutal.</p>

<p>Islam has a problem, Islam needs to fix the problem. </p>

<p>fwiw - I am an atheist who rejects Christianity, Judaism, and Islam as they are all born from an incestuous Middle Eastern male. As a descendant of Europe, I hold an easily noticed level of contempt for each of these religions born from a man who fucked his sister and religions which require the idea a son who fucked his mother is responsible for populating the Earth to be a correct idea.This does not stop my rightful recognition that Islam is the worst of the three religions - worst being applied to the realm of terrorism.</p>

<p>Your idiocy is in assuming that these blatant stereotypes are true of every person.  For example, you&#39;re an atheist, and you&#39;re an uninformed yet arrogant idiot (the worst kind), but that doesn&#39;t mean that I assume <em>all</em> atheists are uninformed yet arrogant idiots.</p>

All these revolutions are nothing more than elites struggling for more of the pie. The average person isn&#39;t capable of organizing together. They aren&#39;t educated or funded enough to be taken seriously by their simple peers. There have been participations in revolt, but the people have never led a successful revolt and never will. People will pay taxes because they don&#39;t want to be harmed by the elites. They accept their slavery. And they accept the sacrifice of their children&#39;s future for the present and for instant happiness. Most simply see things as a quick fix and an end to their immediate suffering. Forethought and vision are not among our skills. Those with the birthright and establishment have the time and patience for such things and thus can use them to direct the herd.</p>

<p>The US, French, Chinese, and Russian revolutions (along with others I&#39;m sure) were pretty significant in a lot of ways. The problem is that revolutions turn into a new Establishment within a very short period of time. <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson#1780s">Thomas Jefferson had it right</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>God forbid we should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion. The people cannot be all, and always, well informed. The part which is wrong will be discontented, in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive. If they remain quiet under such misconceptions, it is lethargy, the forerunner of death to the public liberty. … What country before ever existed a century and half without a rebellion? And what country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure.</p>

<p>They were also all carried out by elites and minorities that held their interests above all others. The US revolution was carried out by slave owners, lawyers and opportunists who didn&#39;t want to follow the establishment but wanted to make their own. The Russian revolution was carried out by jews who were furious over the nationalism in Russia, Poland and Germany among other places where they were the minority pushing their will onto the majority. The Chinese revolution was only to turn the nation over to a murderous power. One closely tied to the communism under the jewish (Russian) revolution of Russia.</p>

<p>The fact is that the people at the bottom are led by hand by these revolutionary powers into a new tyranny. They are not decision makers. They can&#39;t be.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not wealth <em>to you</em>. To the billions of people living right now in abject poverty who possess almost none of those things, it most certainly is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As for eduction, most people in the US do not have that LUXURY.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The US has essentially universal literacy in reading, basic math, and a number of other areas. Again, billions of people on the planet don&#39;t possess these things. Are you referring only to university-level education?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not talking about national wealth, I&#39;m talking about personal wealth relative to the past, as well as to people living in underdeveloped countries planet-wide right now.</p>

Participate in &quot;the machine&quot; as little as possible and discuss the big picture with friends and family.  My hope is that these old, archaic, corrupt power structures that plague us today will sort of just &quot;fall away&quot; once we all wake up from our amnesia and realize it&#39;s all bullshit.  It really would be as simple as that - the hard part is getting to that point.</p>

<p>I think it starts by using the minds we&#39;ve all been given and realizing the depth to which this world is controlled by relatively few people.  One way of doing this, in my opinion (which is why I made this post), is to actually give some thought to how it&#39;s possible that there are many people literally <em>defending torture</em> as if it&#39;s a necessary and justified thing for our government to be doing with our tax dollars.</p>

<p>When you say &quot;shoe in the machine&quot;, what are you talking about?  I work a job for a company that&#39;s at least partially &quot;part of the machine&quot; and in that way I&#39;m supporting the machine.  To me, &quot;shoe in the machine&quot; implies that you&#39;re working against it from within rather than just working for it while being ideologically opposed (as I do).</p>

<p>I think more good is accomplished by giving positive energy to something that deserves it rather than wasting negative energy on something that deserves it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they don&#39;t want to hear about torture, or nazis. it&#39;s overwhelming to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know and I agree, but this is a major (possibly the biggest) part of the problem.  As long as people are apathetic to their enslavement or <em>willfully ignoring</em> their enslavement, they will continue to be slaves.  We all will.  Ignoring that fact won&#39;t make it go away, despite how much we want it to.</p>

<p>Ignoring that our tax dollars help support the murder and rape and torture of thousands of people per year will not make any of those things stop.  In fact, ignoring them will only make them happen with more frequency and with less discretion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>these guys have been shoving it up the ass of arabs since well before the crusades.</p>

<p>What point are you making here?  The military has been raping and pillaging for thousands of years, so fuck it?  That&#39;s just the way things are?  Do you not realize that it&#39;s that very mindset that lets this shit go on?</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t much difference in preference.   I  can also conceive circumstances where I would also be ideologically for the system too and have even more effect of hastening its end (even unintentionally) </p>

You will hear it in many ways from many people until it&#39;s pervasive.   It can happen fairly quickly.    Even front page of reddit today is talking about MKULTRA and nazism in US.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a well documented fact that the US government and other superpowers have described information on the internet in web forums/social media as &quot;the modern battleground&quot;. </p>

<p>In various slides that were hacked from their database, a direct order was to target &quot;conspiracy&quot; websites. And here we are on the largest and most active web forum in history, in the conspiracy section.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to be honest, the way I see things going now, the world seems like it is heading towards one more final, cataclysmic war. The kind of things you see on the news nowadays is eerily similar to the build up to the first and second world wars, and I fear it may end the same way. Those that would seek to benefit most are those that would want to establish their order out of the chaos. Think of how radically the world changed after the previous great wars, perhaps a third one was intended from the start? In regards to the torture report, I believe our nation will eventually have to answer for the insurmountable crimes and atrocities committed in our name. Think Germany post-second world war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there is a third World War, and there very well may be, I think it will be mostly contrived and planned by the &quot;elite&quot; at the top who have always worked together by controlling both sides.  Order out of chaos, like you said.</p>

<p>To be honest, I think the &quot;third World War&quot; started a few decades ago and has really intensified since 9/11 and it&#39;s a silent war between the people and the ruling elite.  An information war, a spiritual war - I could see the mythological &quot;WWIII&quot; being used to bring about the desired outcome of this war.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The same officer provided a description of the procedure, writing that &quot;[r]egarding the rectal tube, if you place it and open up the IV tubing, the flow will self regulate, sloshing up the large intestines.&quot;</p>

<p>Referencing the experience of the medical officer who subjected KSM to rectal rehydration, the officer wrote that, &quot;[w]hat I infer is that you get a tube up as far as you can, then open the IV wide. No need to squeeze the bag - let gravity do the work.&quot; </p>

<p>The same email exchange included a description of a previous application of the technique, in which &quot;we used the largest Ewal
[sic] tube we had.</p>

<p>As described in the context of the rectal feeding of al-Nashiri, Ensure was infused into al-Nashiri &quot;in a forward-facing position (Trendlenberg) with head lower than torso.&quot;</p>

<p>Still haven&#39;t lost your humor though and that&#39;s something!</p>

<p>You&#39;re right though, everyone just wants to feel validated and accepted in this day and age.  Everyone wants to be told that what they&#39;re doing is fashionable and that they&#39;re &quot;part of something&quot;.</p>

<p>I take the exact opposite approach.  Most of the shit in the mainstream is garbage, why would I want to associate myself with that?</p>

There are about 15-20 parts of the report that talk specifically about this &quot;interrogation technique&quot;.</p>

<p>Also, FYI, you&#39;re demonstrating exactly what I&#39;m talking about in this OP by asking to be spoon fed rather than educate yourself on your own terms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t trying to insult you, just pointing out that things like what you said in your other comment are far too common and are part of what I was addressing in this OP.</p>

<p>In case you didn&#39;t find it, here&#39;s one of the sections in the report about this that I posted elsewhere in this thread:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The same officer provided a description of the procedure, writing that &quot;[r]egarding the rectal tube, if you place it and open up the IV tubing, the flow will self regulate, sloshing up the large intestines.&quot;</p>

<p>Referencing the experience of the medical officer who subjected KSM to rectal rehydration, the officer wrote that, &quot;[w]hat I infer is that you get a tube up as far as you can, then open the IV wide. No need to squeeze the bag - let gravity do the work.&quot;</p>

<p>The same email exchange included a description of a previous application of the technique, in which &quot;we used the largest Ewal [sic] tube we had.&quot;</p>

<p>As described in the context of the rectal feeding of al-Nashiri, Ensure was infused into al-Nashiri &quot;in a forward-facing position (Trendlenberg) with head lower than torso.&quot;</p>

<p>Majid Khan&#39;s &quot;lunch tray&quot; of hummus, pasta with sauce, nuts, and raisins was &quot;pureed&quot; and rectally infused.</p>

They are just being tortued because the sociopaths who run the country (Dick Chen.ey and friends) just enjoy hurting people. It&#39;s similar to the Nazi&#39;s abusing people in concentration camps: They had a reason that the public accepted at the time. But it turned out just to be a bunch of sociopaths who enjoyed watching families get tortured and finally put into a gas chamber.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as the hummus up the bum. If the guy was on a hunger strike, even if you force fed him orally, he can still vomit it up. You feed him rectally this solves the problem. As far as torture goes it is mostly ineffective. The detainee will tell you anything he thinks you want to hear, regardless if the truthfulness of it. Sleep deprivation to cloud the mind and wear down defences does work. People get tired, they get sloppy, confused, more easily led. Plus no one really suffers long term.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to state that I am not in any way defending torture or the actions of certain agencies that are now coming to light.</p>

<p>That being said, I believe it is inaccurate and and wrong to lump all Americans into a guilty designation just because they pay taxes.  Does ANY citizen truly know how their tax money is spent?  We certainly shouldn&#39;t assume this is the only thing the US government has done without the knowledge or consent of the people that is/was morally dubious.  So why lump us all under a &quot;guilty&quot; category?</p>

<p>Any time a single race or nationality is lumped together for the immoral actions of individuals, we see the rise of bigotry, intolerance, hatred, and violence.  These usually harm the innocent more than the guilty. </p>

<p>I am not saying we shouldn&#39;t be morally outraged by the conduct of the CIA.  Torture is neither justified nor effective and those who engage in it should be held accountable.  But let us not lump them in with people whose only crime is trying to survive in a country they were born into.  </p>

<p>Who doesn&#39;t pay <strong>any</strong> taxes in America?  We are one of the most heavily taxed people in history!  And as if we have a choice to say &quot;I choose not pay taxes this year because I don&#39;t agree with my government&quot;.</p>

<p>Instead of focusing on <strong>what</strong> was done, why don&#39;t we focus on <strong>who</strong> approved, ordered, and actually did this and then post their name all over the net and see them arrested.  How about that?</p>

<p>Sure, that&#39;s important too and I agree with you.  But what&#39;s equally important is our consent in all of it - consent by inaction - and to think about where some of our tax dollars are actually going.</p>

<p>I&#39;m with you here - hell, I&#39;m one of them.  I work a 9-5 and (struggle to) pay my bills like everyone else.</p>

<p>I certainly don&#39;t blame myself or you specifically for these things, all I&#39;m saying is that I think it&#39;s about time we all took a step back and a look in the mirror and realized that we <em>are</em> complicit to some extent - those of us who are aware that these things are happening in our names.</p>

<p>The funny thing is, though, if every American collectively chose to not pay taxes, there isn&#39;t much that the .0001% could do about it.  It really is (or at least <em>could</em> be) that simple.  The hard part is getting to that point.</p>

<p>But that is my point; we are not consulted when our government passes a budget.  We are not told what all our tax dollars are spent on, so how can we be complicit in what we are not privy to?  I agree that we should have a say.  I have been advocating a tax system where, either quarterly or bi-annually, the tax payers are given an option to choose where their taxes go.  If a person wants to support war they can allocate it to the war machine.  If they think health-care is an issue then they choose for it to be spent there and so on.  It is a lovely idea but I have no illusions on it ever being implemented.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I toy with this idea as well, though we must acknowledge that many of the taxes we pay are hidden or factored into everyday costs (sales tax, vehicle tax, etc.).  If it were only a matter of income tax I think this route would have been tried already.  Employees and employers aren&#39;t given a whole lot of choice on whether or not to pay that income tax.  Hard to choose not to pay it when it is taken out of your pay check before it is given to you.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There is some truth here; I agree that it is time to take a hard look at ourselves as a nation and make some tough decisions.  I don&#39;t agree that we as citizens should hold ourselves accountable.  This, and many other problems we as a nation are addressing, should spur us to action not make us feel responsible.  Those responsible never asked for our consent, never informed us as to their intent, and in fact kept the truth from us as long as they possibly could.  If anything, this should confirm that we can no longer trust our government.</p>

<p>And please don&#39;t think I&#39;m offended by your post.  I do not take it personally and I hope I haven&#39;t offended you as this was not my intent.  I appreciate your respectful tone and polite, insightful reply.  Thank you for that.</p>

<p>That sounds awesome and, unfortunately, far too sensible to ever come to pass under the current power structure.  I would definitely support something like that too, I think we&#39;d all be amazed at how quickly wa- <em>ahem</em> &quot;defense&quot; spending dried up.  It would be almost overnight.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know, I think it would be pretty significant.  Not just in the nominal dollar amount but in the message it would send and, more importantly, the solidarity it would require.  I think it hasn&#39;t happened yet, primarily, because the people have never stopped bickering long enough to realize their/our own power.</p>

<p>I&#39;m with you here.  I think what I&#39;m trying to highlight isn&#39;t so much how we&#39;ve indirectly helped these things happen as I am with how we can <em>directly</em> stop them from happening now.  I think we ultimately are on the same page.</p>

<p>And we&#39;re on the internet, if you take things personally you&#39;re doing it wrong right?  You&#39;re very welcome my friend, we&#39;re all in this together after all.</p>
