    <div class="md"><p>Nonsense - the CIA isn&#39;t worried at all about the torture report.  These are people who drugged and raped men for decades, engaged in torture experiments in conjunction with dozens of major academic institutions in the United States, have abandoned uprisings they instigated, and experimented on and tortured people for decades without any consequence.  The CIA has nothing to worry about at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, yes, I suppose it was more buried than the internet allows.  But, then again, the government was torturing and experimenting on U.S. citizens which is less likely to annoy the left wing than torturing Salafists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the biggest misunderstandings about how information control works.  People think it works like 1984 where the government deletes events/movies/info from history.  It doesn&#39;t.  People would notice, and get angry(since we supposedly live in a free society).  It is a lot more effective to simply limit the audience that views the &quot;material&quot;, and to discredit the information(or person providing the information).  If only 1 million people know about MK ultra for instance, and 200,000 of those people think it&#39;s not that important because of disinformation, it is a controllable problem.  If you try to hide MK ultra from the people, and they find out, they immediately know it is important, and that the Gov&#39;t is blatantly lying(even the sheep would see it).  That&#39;s why it is obvious this is not really motivated by N.K.&#39;s desires(which we could give two shits about).  Do you know how many movies with Russian Presidents getting killed(or portraying the Russians as bad) there were from the start of the cold war to the present?  If we were not threatened by a nuclear armed soviet union, I don&#39;t see how we could be threatened by a poor, non-nuclear N.K. that can barley launch a successful missile.  There are obviously exceptions to the rule, with information that would be so volatile even in the hands of few, that it cannot be afforded to be released(JFK, 911, UFOS).  But 95% of information is out there, somewhere, although repressed, and hidden from plain sight(can&#39;t have every bumbling idiot  accidentally discovering the secrets of the elite) .</p>

<p>Look at the major sub&#39;s (including this one). Whenever a particular story becomes The Story, I am always skeptical of the details. Anonymous US officials confirm NK&#39;s involvement? North Korean hacker code? A bunch of bullshit to get us thinking a specific way for some reason. I&#39;m not buying any of it.</p>

<p>The interview has had so much publicity it is insane.   Guessing that Sony is planning to release it online.  They&#39;ve either invested heavily in an existing online distro like netflix, Hulu, amazon, or my personal favorite theory: Sony will be launching a new online marketplace.  I don&#39;t have a play station, but I assume there is a playstation marketplace; maybe they are looking to expand this market place beyond the gaming console. </p>

<p>Sony may have had a deal where they were going to take little of the theatrical release profits, and take a larger share of the online or other profits, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s pretty far fetched.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t expensive enough or niche enough to expect, even if it was mediocre, that it wouldn&#39;t recoup.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not convinced they would have insurance that would sufficiently cover this very odd eventuality.</p>

<p>Sony is taking a bath on this, but the potential loss (movie&#39;s budget and some legal settlements for lost revenue from cast and crew) well be much less than the potential loss of the threats of physical violence were plausible.</p>

<p>Ideally, from Sony&#39;s perspective, the halt of the film&#39;s release may also bring an end to the release of their stolen data (but that&#39;s yet to be seen).</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fairly simple business decision, although a terrible precedent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t think the torture thing is that big of an issue, or they wouldn&#39;t have released it.  If they can say &quot;fuck off&quot; to the public about the surveillance debate(and 9/11 and JFK), they could easily do the same with the torture report, but it&#39;s not that big of an issue.  If you&#39;re worried about international law violations with torture, don&#39;t worry.  We violated the GREATEST war crime created at Nuremberg by conducting a war of aggression(Iraq), and even made it a law, called the bush doctrine, which allows wars of aggression(without congressional approval).  I think the &quot;pulling&quot; of The Interview this is just another distraction(like the torture report), added to the list, along with Ebola(which magically disappeared once elections were over).  Instead of arguing about whether it is ok that they just passed a law making interception <strong>OF ANY COMMUNICATION GLOBALLY WITHOUT A WARRANT</strong> legal a few days ago, we are arguing about whether torture is OK(it&#39;s not, and there is no real argument to be made in favor, it&#39;s just a distraction), whether Ebola is a threat(its not, and there is no real argument in favor), and whether we should give into terrorist demands(we shouldn&#39;t, and once again, there is no real argument in favor).  We already had these debates as a society decades ago, and they are being brought up again to distract us from the real problems(the elite, and the wealth/power gap).</p>
