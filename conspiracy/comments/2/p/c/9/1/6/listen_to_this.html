<p>What do you mean exactly?  Like what?  To my knowledge, the &quot;Mars Defense Force&quot; (or whatever it&#39;s called) has been the main force he says he&#39;s been involved with from the beginning, and I haven&#39;t heard him diverge from that too much if at all.</p>

<p>Really?  That he was <em>abducted by aliens?</em>  Could you point me specifically to where you read that?  I&#39;ve listened to three of his talks and counting (7+ hours of lectures so far beginning from just a day or two ago) and haven&#39;t heard once about him mentioning anything about being &quot;abducted by aliens&quot;.  Would be very interested to see what you read.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>worked with mind control programs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Didn&#39;t really hear him talk much about that either.  Another reference it&#39;d be great if you point me toward if you could.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>been to several different planets serving as a Marine special forces on those planets</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That I heard.  Didn&#39;t hear so much about &quot;several different planets&quot;, however, as much as about Mars only.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>time travel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Didn&#39;t hear him talk directly about this either.  I heard that he reference Andrew Basiago, and Basiago definitely talks about it, but I don&#39;t recall Cramer making great mention of it himself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>anti-aging.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That I heard mention of by virtue of the holographic physical regeneration technology that he described.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yeah.  You have Randy Cramer, Andrew Basiago, Bret Stillings, and Bernard Mendez all corroborating and supporting one anothers&#39; stories.  Very interesting, to say that least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>So, the 2006 interview you spoke about above actually <em>wasn&#39;t</em> with Randy Cramer then.  He came out and started speaking actually in 2013/2014.  It <em>just</em> happened.  Not in 2006.</p>

<p>And regarding his abductions, they were actually MILABS.  They were all military abductions done on him by members of THIS planet.  In other words, they weren&#39;t extraterrestrial abductions.</p>

<p>Also, I didn&#39;t read any mention of his visiting any other planets aside from Mars.</p>

<p>Regardless, very interesting stuff.  Thanks for linking it.</p>

<p>Do you know any physicians personally? Ask them how likely this is or how or why all the medical research that goes into developing these capabilities has been hushed up. Bear in mind that if you happen to know a surgeon who specializes in re-attacing or re-vascularizing limbs or digits after an accident, they very likely know every single luminary in their profession from the conferences that they attend. If they have never heard of such a capability it&#39;s bullshit.</p>

It <em>is</em> indeed pretty &quot;out there&quot; stuff compared to what the average shmuck like you or me have been indoctrinated to think is possible.

<p>Not at all. My argument is that the people who advance the research in these fields comprise a very small group. They all know each other, publish in a small handful of professional journals, and even know the people who control the grants to do research in these fields. If they say they have never heard of this, then its unlikely that its been done and that the technology and the people developing it remain a complete secret. </p>

<p>Not sure if you noticed this or not, but the second half of your sentence actually contradicts the first half of it.  The people and the projects involved in this <em>do</em> remain in secret, and that&#39;s why the figures in the public sector which you refer to haven&#39;t actually heard about any of it.</p>

<p>Fuck a Nobel Prize.  The NP is a joke.</p>

<p>Fuck that too.  Here you pine to the money aspect of things.  This has to do with the advancement of human civilization on this planet - not how much money and &quot;cushy lucrative sinecures&quot; on can have.</p>

<p>Who would prefer it?  Try the individuals who would get killed before being able to divulge any of that information to the public by those secretive forces working behind the scenes - forces that are <em>significantly</em> more powerful than any scientific or medical board we &quot;lowly citizens&quot; know anything about.  When there are covert powers on this planet powerful enough to make mince meat out of any individual attempting to divulge to the public the practically magical capabilities of some of these technologies, people who know about them tend to stfu and not say a thing quick, fast, and in a hurry.</p>

So unless he actually has real hard evidence that&#39;s not &quot;well it&#39;s dangerous to impersonate an officer, so he must be real&quot;, then I really don&#39;t see how it&#39;s possible to take him seriously.</p>

<p>Seems actually a pretty solid indication that he is in fact telling the truth - like I said from the onset - and that impersonating a military officer is indeed an absolutely prosecutable offense that can result in years of prison time.</p>

<p>If this is your entire proof, then I&#39;ve got some bad news.</p>

<p>Dude, we haven&#39;t even gone back to the moon, yet we&#39;ve already constructed a mars base? Nothing he&#39;s saying sounds remotely plausible, and to top it off, there is no evidence that any of what he&#39;s saying is true.</p>

<p>I started watching it, and from the start there were massive holes in his theories. Watching the other 6 hours just seemed like a waste at that point.</p>

<p>First of all, you didn&#39;t mention anyone with such credentials who corroborates the story. Secondly, I really don&#39;t get why his claim alone somehow proves anything. He says he doesn&#39;t want to go to jail, but tat hardly proves he&#39;s telling the truth.

<p>You literally are. You&#39;ve listed him, and one other guy who also gives no evidence as pretty much the sole justifications for this, and yet you seem convinced that this means that they are $100% telling the truth.</p>

<p>What&#39;s getting old is your willingness to believe whatever someone says as long as it fits your worldview.</p>

<p>I really hope you never try to become a scientist, or you&#39;ll be in for a rude awakening. Fact is, to make a claim, you need evidence. Your claim does not actually have evidence. Until there is evidence, good luck actually getting people to believe you. Hell, I could claim that the earth is flat, and make up some random claim. Would that then mean that I would have to be telling the truth?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There is no opinion here. It&#39;s a yes or no question &quot;is there actually evidence for these extremely outrageous claims?&quot;. If the answer is no, then your argument never had any basis to begin with, and was just you being duped by a guy who claims to be a space soldier. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR[1]</p>

<p>At this point it&#39;s clear that nothing will change your mind, no matter how dumb your claims are, so I guess we might as well end this here.</p>

<p>Absolutely I did.  I even linked it.  But you know what?  You don&#39;t know anything about it.  And you know why?  Because you showed yourself over and over again to be too ignorant to actually understand that there is quite a bit of valid information in the videos I linked.  You said yourself that you didn&#39;t look at them.</p>

<p>And then you went off saying what &quot;is&quot; and &quot;isn&#39;t&quot; the case or what I &quot;did&quot; or &quot;didn&#39;t&quot; present.  This is a classic case of <a href="http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/ignorance.html">argumentum ad ignorantiam</a> on your part...and it&#39;s really, really sad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Secondly, I really don&#39;t get why his claim alone somehow proves anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#39;t.  However, the fact that it&#39;s 1) corroborated, and 2) being made by someone who would be risking prison prosecution if he <em>were</em> lying indicates a lot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He says he doesn&#39;t want to go to jail, but tat hardly proves he&#39;s telling the truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s really wearisome having to correct the constant fallacious thinking in almost every single sentence you make.  I will probably stop responding soon, as it&#39;s more than abundantly clear that you&#39;re not really making any really strong arguments, and you just simply want to continue believing that this &quot;can&#39;t possibly be true!&quot;.  Look, if that&#39;s how you think and that&#39;s what you want to believe, then okay.  Go right ahead.  However, you&#39;re not really convincing anyone but yourself that you have any argument whatsoever in saying this.  I think you&#39;re trying to look like you <em>do</em> have an argument to others possibly reading this...</p>

<p>But you don&#39;t.  And it&#39;s taking longer than I have patience for to continue battling with you back and forth when you want to continue believing in whatever it is you want to believe.  It&#39;s okay if you do.  Meh.</p>

<p>This being said, I&#39;ll make a few final attempts to continue as long as I can before just saying &quot;fuck it&quot; lol.</p>

<p>You say he &quot;hardly proves he&#39;s telling the truth&quot;, yet the fact of the matter is that he gives very strong indication on various fronts that he indeed is.  That you simply refuse to understand the validity of what&#39;s presented is just plainly on you.  Somebody can say &quot;nuh uh!&quot; all they want.  It doesn&#39;t make something the case any less than it is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If anything, it just sounds like he&#39;s trying to hide the fact that he has nothing to do with the military, let alone anything to do with mars bases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...Okay.</p>

<p>The rest of what you typed...just wasn&#39;t read.  I saw that it plainly wasn&#39;t worth it.  Yours is the mind of the blind and willingly, obstinately ignorant person.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not really worth continuing to respond to you or even reading what else you have to say, as you&#39;ve been saying the same thing over and over again.  You can type out whatever you want in response.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll just ignored it.</p>

<p>You&#39;re free to do whatever the heel you want, but that doesn&#39;t make your argument any less idiotic. I&#39;ll say the same thing I&#39;ve said before, your entire argument hinges on one guy who claims he was in the space military, and another guy with equally useless credentials. It&#39;s very clearly bullshit, no matter how many mental gymnastics you go through to legitimize it. It&#39;s not a question of &quot;thinking critically&quot;, it&#39;s an issue of not being duped by clearly retarded theories like this one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>So, the 2006 interview you spoke about above actually <em>wasn&#39;t</em> with Randy Cramer then.  He came out and started speaking actually in 2013/2014.  It <em>just</em> happened.  Not in 2006.</p>

<p>And regarding his abductions, they were actually MILABS.  They were all military abductions done on him by members of THIS planet.  In other words, they weren&#39;t extraterrestrial abductions.</p>

<p>Also, I didn&#39;t read any mention of his visiting any other planets aside from Mars.</p>

<p>Regardless, very interesting stuff.  Thanks for linking it.</p>
