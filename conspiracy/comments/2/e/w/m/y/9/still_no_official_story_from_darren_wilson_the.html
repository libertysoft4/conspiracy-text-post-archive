<p>First he didnt know about the robbery, then now maybe he could have seen the cigars and thought Mike Brown was the robber.</p>

<p>Then the autopsy comes out so we know the number of shots and where they hit Mike, so Darren can spin his story to fit that.</p>

<p>Then a tape of the shots being fired with a delay in the middle. NOW, he gets time to come up with a story to account for the delay.</p>

<p>How is it possible that he can just sit there and watch all this stuff come out so he can have a tailor made story that fits around all the evidence?</p>

<p>This kind of stuff leads me to believe whatever he says will line up and &quot;make sense&quot;regardless of if it is true or not. </p>

<p>Why arent more people talking about this? There is no transparency. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a matter of <em>justifying</em> that homicide at this point, which I cannot possibly see happen given the lack of any effort by the officer (no incident/use of force report, no dispatcher radio call in, no EMS, nada).</p>

<p>If this had been someone with a concealed carry permit, they&#39;d have been arrested. The sad part is a badge gets you out of this and lets you fabricate evidence.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t miss that part. But courts should, because they can&#39;t be prejudiced. And that&#39;s why he should be silent at this point. Which is his right. </p>

<p>You&#39;re not a fan of innocent until proven guilty, then? It&#39;s exactly a case of of figuring out if a crime, and which one, was committed before he&#39;s judged guilty in a court. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Start at the beginning. He didn&#39;t complete his routine incident report that is supposed to be filed after any interaction with a civilian where a police officer witnesses a crime. Probably because the first person he spoke with was a fellow officer on the scene who told him to get a lawyer and not complete the report. That lawyer probably told him to keep his mouth closed.</p>

<p>There are a lot of off-the-record conversations happening right now in the police department to make sure that <em>Wilson&#39;s memory</em> matches all the physical evidence, witness testimony, videos, images, etc. They are manufacturing testimony behind closed doors.</p>

<ul>

    <div class="md"><p>But this is DEAD wrong. He is NOT a suspect of anything. There was no crime as far as the cops go.</p>

<p>He is a cop that had an incident and and has failed to file a police report on said incident. Its like any other incident a cop is involved in. They file a report in a reasonable manner. </p>

<p>By waiting to file a report and choosing to hide behind a line of cops, hide behind his badge he is refusing to put his word as a cop to record. Hell, we didnt even know his name for nearly a week. Is THIS the America you want to live in?  Where a public official can kill someone, not have his name revealed and have no report filed? Because its only going to get worse.</p>

<p>I imagine if Mike Brown was white we would be having a very different conversation.</p>

<p>Some of you people have no iidea how frustrating it is that you will seemingly be against injustice, but only selectively. White males who refuse to defend the rights of black males in the same fucking boat as them. It makes you traitors to your people. The AMERICAN people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every interaction between civilian and police can lead to investigation and prosecution of a police officer, from simple traffic stop to homicide. The purpose of law enforcement is to enforce the law, so they are granted authorities. One of the guidelines that must be followed to retain these authorities is to provide accurate justification as to why any action was taken against a civilian (i.e. an incident report, other paperwork, communications, chains of custody, collection of evidence - and all of this information is supposed to exist for the fair trial of the <em>actual</em> suspect - the civilian).</p>

<p>If a police officer arrests someone for loitering, and the suspect says &quot;I&#39;m going to sue you for this, I&#39;m gonna make sure you&#39;re prosecuted for misconduct&quot;, and then the officer says I plead the fifth and refuses to complete the incident report of what led to the arrest and even concealed the incident itself - that is dereliction of duty. It&#39;s misconduct in itself.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> A cop is not a civilian when he&#39;s acting under color of law, just as his free speech is limited, so is his right to remain silent (if he wants to keep his job) because his silence is counter-intuitive to his ultimate purpose: a trustworthy witness for the State. You can&#39;t have cops going around fining, arresting and assaulting civilians if they don&#39;t provide justification.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I know every person has the right to remain silent, including law enforcement officers.</p></li>
<li><p>However, I think a person does not have the <strong>right to keep their job</strong> for exercising the right to remain silent, especially if not remaining silent is paramount to the employment.</p></li>

<p>I&#39;m fully respecting the Constitution. There is no amendment that reads:</p>

<p>And the crazy thing is, I am sure most people here know this, but for some reason they are acting stuck on stupid with all this free speech nonsense for cops. Its a shame that you even have to state what you did, but I am happy you did. They automatically jump to defending the cop. I think it goes like this:</p>

<p>white cop black shot - defend cop
white cop white shot - defend shot
black cop white shot - defend shot
black cop black shot - defend shot</p>

<p>and the sad part of THAT is that 99% of these case are white cop black shot.  Sigh. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was no automatically defending the white cop, you must have been watching the news and living on a different planet if you think that&#39;s true. there was automatic support for MB and villainization of this police officer, who ABSOLUTELY has the right to remain silent and I can guarantee that in this case his attorneys have demanded that he remain silent. It also contaminates the witness statements for them to release certain info before the investigation is completed. Some people must be trying to be willfully ignorant of these facts in order to continue their evil cop narrative. It seems too many peoples here have this strange view of lynch mob justice vs. trying to figure out how the law actually works. Trying to say that he mishandled the incident by not &quot;filing a routine report&quot; is also bogus because the case was almost immediately turned over to the FBI for investigation, so it does NOT mean that he therefore gives up his right to remain silent (how would that make sense??). Is NOBODY here going to mention how because he has been getting death threats and so much violence has occurred &quot;protesting&quot; the shooting...he is even MORE entitled to hide and stay silent. So the very people demanding transparency are the people who are giving him justification to be in hiding. Maybe if people hadn&#39;t of lost their crap and starting looting and burning down buildings things would be a little different. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that he deserves due process and a fair trial. I also agree with the fact that if you exercise your rights you don&#39;t automatically have something to hide. However for a police officer to avoid the incident report is sketchy. I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s guilty, he very well may have had a reason on why he shot Brown. But without the incident report there is no way to know if he had a reason to or not. The fact that he may be going to court over this ordeal should not matter. He&#39;s a police officer. He has duties he is supposed to uphold and for not upholding them he should be suspended without pay for now. It is sickening what this country has turned into. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because HIS LAWYERS would obviously advise him to not talk because a) it could effect the investigations and b) that isn&#39;t how our justice system works. you don&#39;t just use mobs to demand answers on your own bogus timeline, while also wreaking havoc on a Ferguson and putting out death threats. This crap has gotten so out of control that they obviously want to make sure the investigation is thorough because it will be put under a lot of criticism, and clearly some people have made up their minds without knowing the facts and no amount of evidence will change their opinion. Total ignorance.</p>

<p>and what do you mean why is nobody talking about this? EVERYONE has been talking about this WAY too much from the beginning. why is nobody talking about the other people who have gotten killed by police while being unarmed, or the people who have died from black on black violence, or all the people who were injured during the rioting??? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And of course he shouldn&#39;t even provide any story at all. Giving your own version to police will only ever make things worse for yourself. </p>

<p><em>Even if you are innocent and are telling the truth</em>.</p>

<p>It just opens your story to be contested by prosecution. If you give no story at all, there will only be the (probably) conflicting accounts from witnesses, which opens reasonable doubt. If you decide to speak, your version will be (probably) conflicting and you will seem more guilty because the prosecution can point to your &quot;lies&quot;, even if it&#39;s the truth.</p>

<p>Additionally people should remember that they <em>never</em> have to speak to police. They will try something like &quot;you aren&#39;t even a suspect&quot; or &quot;you&#39;re obstructing investigation&quot;, but you can never know when you will become a suspect and remaining silent is not obstruction. </p>

<p>This should be common knowledge, especially in this sub. </p>

Its his JOB to file an incident report as soon as possible after an incident to get it all on record for his protection and the protection from him. So that stuff like this does not happen where stories can be changed etc. We as citizens dont have to file reports. COPS do. For his own personal preservation it makes sense to not file his report until more facts come out and he can make sure his ducks are in a row, but doing so under the color of law is actually not really legal. Additionally, its interesting to see so many people in this sub immediately go to defend Wilson, a cop, from possibly being a part of this police state that is a big issue on this board. And then also go and be all extra racist against blacks making stupid statements. You motherfuckers cant have it both ways. &quot;The police state is real but only when it applies to police attacking whites. If they attack blacks, then good&quot;.

<p>The justice system is not actually fundamentally fucked: the jury of peers is a pretty good system. It&#39;s the later additions and changes that made the system unfair. </p>

<p>Namely, mandatory sentencing minimums that mean the prosecutor has unfair negotiation leverage in most cases, and prohibitive costs of jury trials for the defendant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what information we have, <em>that</em> is the reason Darren Wilson stopped/approached Mike Brown -- jaywalking. He was <em>not</em> responding to a robbery/shoplifting call. This is a fact.</p>

<p>Here are the other facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mike Brown was roughly 6&#39;4 and 300 lbs.</li>
<li>Mike Brown was found dead in the street, ~35ft from the police cruiser.</li>
<li>Mike Brown suffered six gunshot wounds total.</li>
<li>The last two gunshot wounds were in the head, one at the top of the head (likely fatal).</li>
<li>Mike Brown&#39;s body has no gun powder residue (meaning no close quarter gunfire).</li>
<li>There was no police report filed by Darren Wilson.</li>
<li>There was no use of force report filed by Darren Wilson.</li>
<li>There was no EMS ever dispatched to either Darren Wilson or Mike Brown.</li>
<li>Dispatch recordings show that Darren Wilson never called in the stop nor the incidents following it.</li>
<li>Mike Brown&#39;s body laid in the streets for over 4 hours before being picked up by a police SUV.</li>
<li>Audio surfacing shows at least 10-11 shots were fired, with a brief pause in between volleys.</li>
<li>Darren Wilson&#39;s previous police precinct was dissolved due to misconduct and racism.</li>
</ul>

<p>So you tell me what conclusions I should reach?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is patently false and was proven in Ferguson. The violence and chaos was directly proportional to the level of police.</p>

<p>Riot police in their militarized hardware caused the biggest problems of all. The following days where it was just state police in standard uniforms it was much more tame. Riot police come back out, it gets worse. They go away, it gets better.</p>

<p>I know you&#39;re going to say that &quot;they were deployed in response to..&quot; but that&#39;s bogus. If you say that I know for a fact you did not watch any of it live because I did and that&#39;s not what happened at all. Police were the aggressors every time, even to the media. That&#39;s why several officers have been suspended/fired due to their overly hostile behavior to citizens and media.</p>

<p>The police did <strong>not</strong> do shit for the small businesses. Looters were <strong>not</strong> arrested and police did not answer calls from businesses. A large majority (~90%) of the arrests were from &quot;failure to disperse.&quot; The protestors themselves did more to stop looting than the police did.</p>
