        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I went back to view it again, wanted to examine the background audio after seeing someone pointing out there is no wind.  Went to liveleak, found/searched for the video: <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=bc1_1408481278">http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=bc1_1408481278</a> and was about to extract/download it from there. </p>

<p>But i am presented with <a href="http://i.imgur.com/yoNIgx2.png">THIS</a><br/>
I thought liveleak was the last of all places to promote censorship...  </p>

<p>Over at <a href="http://www.ukcolumn.org/">http://www.ukcolumn.org/</a> on the 21st august edition, they had a part detailing that they asked the police force under which law it is classed when it comes to &quot;viewing video&quot; breaking the law, and they refused to comment. Suggesting there is no law, but the police force and the BBC (surprise surprise) likes to think that it is against the terrorist act of 2008 and that anyone who simply views the (most likely faked) beheading video where there isn&#39;t even a beheading taking place, will be branded a potential terrorist.  </p>

<p>So what is going on, is liveleak protecting/covering for users in the UK, or what? As far as i&#39;m concerned there is no law stating that you cannot watch video, even having said that, it is nothing but a snuff video. The content of the video breaks no laws in terms of an observer watching it  </p>

<p>That is some bullshit logic. You can&#39;t ask me to prove something wasn&#39;t the case because you can&#39;t put forward any kind of evidence yourself. There is a video showing the beginning of the execution and an image of his severed head resting on his headless corpse. What else do you need? You&#39;re the one claiming this was fake, the burden of proof lies with you. </p>

<p>It&#39;s incredibly disrespectful to attempt to turn this into a conspiracy theory, you have no evidence to back up your claim. Imagine if your son, brother or father was Foley, how would you feel if you read all these claims of conspiracy theories? </p>

<p>conspiracy nut logic</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I heard that many times in the past decade when i mentioned to people that government spy agencies are illegally monitoring everything you do online and offline. I recall there were leaks confirming their actions recently, but nobody batted an eye and when i mention that the government is spying on people today they tell me &quot;you&#39;re a conspiracy nut&quot;.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s easier to turn to insults than it is to actually do anything about the worlds problems. To think for one moment that your government (whichever nation) would lie to you is unbelievable for some. Western governments are the biggest liars on the planet. Whether it be spying programmes or staged events to make a pretext for invasion... why would anyone able to think for themselves believe <em>anything</em> their government stands by?  </p>

<p>It appears to be more criminal to suggest the beheading video was probably faked, than it is to actually perform a beheading... that tells you something.  </p>

There is no beheading. There is a man in a chokehold, fades to black, then there is a panned picture of the alleged aftermath. At no point in the video/footage does James Foley&#39;s head come off.
