<p>Key quotes below:-</p>

<p>Dr. Johnston, pg. 14-15 &amp; 19-20: &quot;The data on its toxicity (shows) it can cause neurologic and renal toxicity, including death.”</p>

<p>Dr. Weil, pg. 24: &quot;There are just a host of neurodevelopmental data that would suggest that we’ve got a serious problem.&quot; .... &quot;the potential for aluminum and central nervous system toxicity was established by dialysis data. To think there isn’t some possible problem here is unreal.”</p>

<p>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 31: &quot;we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposure and outcomes for these different exposures and outcomes.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 44: &quot;Now for speech delays, which is the largest single disorder in this category of neurologic delays. The results are a suggestion of a trend with a small dip. The overall test for trend is highly statistically significant above one.”</p>

<p>Dr. Bernier, pg. 113: &quot;So we are asking people who have a great job protecting this information up until now, to continue to do that until the time of the ACIP meeting. So to basically consider this embargoed information.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson, pg. 198: &quot;This association leads me to favor a recommendation that infants up to two years old not be immunized with Thimerosal containing vaccines if suitable alternative preparations are available.” ... &quot;I do not want that grandson to get a Thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Weil, pg. 207: &quot;The number of dose related relationships are linear and statistically significant. You can play with this all you want. They are linear. They are statistically significant.</p>

<p>Dr. Brent, pg. 229 &quot;we are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Clements, pg 247- 249: &quot;that I am very concerned that this has gotten this far, and that having got this far, how you present in a concerted voice the information to the ACIP in a way they will be able to handle it and not get exposed&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Bernier, pg. 256: &quot;just consider this embargoed information, if I can use that term, and very highly protected information&quot;</p>

<p>Firstly, you haven&#39;t checked this link, this is not about the Wakefield study.</p>

<p>Secondly, regarding the Wakefield study (since you&#39;re talking about it), he knew the limitation of his sample size and recommended &#39;Further Research&#39;, he did not draw a conclusion.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Wakefield&#39;s study was not funded by Big Pharma, look into that yourself and you will see he was not.  Big Pharma aren&#39;t stupid, they do not fund an honest man to do research on the dangers of their vaccines, they are not self-harmers or suicidal.</p>

<p>He may not have drawn any conclusions himself, but then why are the &quot;anti-vax&quot; crowd so keen to bring up his study? It&#39;s not because they only doubt vaccines, it&#39;s because they think his study somehow &quot;proves&quot; vaccines cause autism.</p>

<p>The anti-vax crowd are not talking about Wakefield, there are newer concerning studies which are of more interest, it is generally pro-vaccine people who bring up Wakefield.</p>

<p>Most people who think vaccines cause Autism did not draw their conclusion from listening to Wakefield, they are witnesses to children regressing into Autism within 48 hours of a vaccine, that is how anti-vaccine parents are born.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t realize all you needed to prove something was personal testimony from people who are not doctors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wakefield recommended that MMR was suspended, he was never anti-vaccine, he said move back to single vaccines for Measles, Mumps and Rubella.  Unfortunately the UK government then removed the availability of single vaccines meaning that parents either had to get MMR or nothing.  It was the UK government which caused the problem, not Wakefield.  Keep in mind that it&#39;s now been proven Wakefield was right i.e. CDC whistle-blower who confessed covering up Vaccine/Autism data, so the parents who listened to him will be very grateful.</p>

<p>People need to get out of this anti-Wakefield habit, it&#39;s taking a while for the news over the last few days to sink in, or maybe people just haven&#39;t read it properly.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll repeat it again, a CDC whistleblower has now confirmed that Wakefield was right all along and there&#39;s been a cover-up going on.</p>

<p>Dr Wakefield, Sir Wakefield, this man is now a hero.</p>

<p>MMR doesn&#39;t protect against Polio.</p>

<p>Measles doesn&#39;t kill many people, and the ones it does kill are malnourished (lacking Vitamin A).  There&#39;s no point in making thousands of children mentally handicapped to save one person in a million from Measles.  Best scrap the dangerous vaccine and give out Vitamin A supplements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason why measles doesn&#39;t kill many people is because the majority of people are vaccinated against it. If we stopped vaccinating everyone tomorrow, then in ten to fifteen years, we would have an enormous resurgence of diseases we thought were eradicated.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t compare the two options because there is no autism vaccine, but there is a measles vaccine.</p>

<p>My point being that if very few people are dying of measles, then the program works. I don&#39;t want to imagine a world where there is no vaccine, and thousands of people die of a preventable disease.</p>

<p>&quot;My name is William Thompson.  I am a Senior Scientist with the Centers for Disease Control and</p>

<p>Prevention, where I have worked since 1998.</p>

<p>I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information  in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased  risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed.&quot;</p>
