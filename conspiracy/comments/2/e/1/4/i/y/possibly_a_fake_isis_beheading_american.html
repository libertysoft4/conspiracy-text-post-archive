<p>Does this come off as fake to anyone? It seemed weird that Foley wasn&#39;t the least bit worried about the fact that he was going to be brutally murdered after his statement. The beheading portion is weird as well- fades out as soon as he starts sawing away then cuts to a photo of Foley already beheaded.</p>

<p>Just a thought.</p>

<p>Edit: Maybe I&#39;m mistaken, but there didn&#39;t seem to be any blood following the cut to his neck.</p>

<p>The weird thing is it seems just overly produced.  Someone else mase a very good point that normally terrorists like to display their craft. The main focus was the beheading and they edited out like a PG-13 movie. </p>

<p>Why do that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is ISIS guys. The terrorist group publishing an annual report and demonstrating a perfect use of social media. </p>

<p>The idea here, with the self censorship is to make sure that one precise image would go viral in the mainstream media, in this case the last frame before the fade to black —the knife under the throat. This is a carefully and well executed propaganda strategy. Because they know that big tabloids will jump on this image/opportunity. They know.</p>

<p>Otherwise beheading videos stay on Liveleaks or gore sites where most mainstream viewers never go. For a few precious hours the video was available, downloaded and of course viewed on Youtube. And because its content is totally acceptable in terms of blood and violence, it will be even more distributed. Any standard gore beheading could never reach this level of impact. </p>

<p>I clearly see a very professional understanding of social media or &quot;how to spread a beheading video to a mainstream audience&quot;, not a niche of gore fans. This is all about reach. Even the small knife has a huge impact in psychologically inducing fear of a barbaric inefficient technique.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a decent comparison.  Note that a one-man executioner will put the person on the ground because sawing off a head with them on their knees is counter productive.  Also they&#39;ll naturally kick and obstruct your actions.  </p>

<p>The blood let down is also immediate and after all that sawing there isn&#39;t a spot of blood.  That would be like a porn shoot without the money shot.  It&#39;s no wonder why the Brits are saying to examine the evidence is illegal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of the beheading videos I have seen the victims are pretty damn calm. From terrorists to Mexican drug gangs - all of them. I think it is more of knowing what is coming and putting your mind somewhere else or at least trying to and maybe even making your final peace internally. They never yell or fight before (or at least not much)</p>

<p>The one thing that was eerily missing was the blood. Within a couple of strokes the blade is in the carotid and blood should start pumping/pouring out. That is the only thing that makes me question the video - no freaking blood. The only way to maybe stop that would be a hot blade that would instantly cauterize the vein. I don&#39;t know if even that would work. Not that it matters as he talked for a while before cutting so the blade would have been significantly cooled by then.</p>

<p>It just doesn&#39;t make physiological, anatomical or medical sense is all I&#39;m saying.</p>

<p>But let just watch them start attacking comments and come up with some ridicilous retorts.</p>

<p>The common one on the frontpage post seems to be that people shouldn&#39;t even watch the video as it would somehow be disrespectful. Ok...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, you have to remember that there aren&#39;t any Americans being killed in Iraq till this extremely fake looking beheading.  Maybe some here and there that have gone to Iraq to join the caliphate, but ISIS isn&#39;t really interested in killing those people.  With an American journalist being executed, it&#39;s supposed to rally that American spirit to get the bad guys, because now they&#39;ve killed one of our own. </p>

<p>ALthough, I think the country is so war weary, one dead American really doesn&#39;t mean a whole lot.  It&#39;s sad if this is real, but as many here have said, there&#39;s no blood.  That&#39;s impossible with the way he&#39;s cutting into this guy&#39;s neck.  </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s now being taken down because it&#39;s clearly fake.  Whoops!  It&#39;s the 21st century and Americans aren&#39;t dumb about media.  It&#39;s the one thing we do right.  We make movies that have more convincing beheadings than this.  Utter nonsense. </p>

<p>I believe ISIS is a bad group, but there has to come a time when the U.S. admits defeat and forfeits the land.  We can&#39;t militarily keep killing people like this, unless we have the intention of following a scorched earth policy and wiping Iraq and Syria clean of all potential terrorists.  This of course would be incredibly difficult logistically as well as ethically wrong.  </p>

<p>I personally think we should let the country fall under ISIS rule and see what happens.  There&#39;s nothing we can do.  And i feel bad for the people that live there, but fuck, it&#39;s just too fucked of a situation to fix.   </p>

You could hear him grunting which tells me that they were causing trauma to the trachea. The vessels, once hit, would bleed like crazy, but I saw no indication of a vessel being hit as most of the trauma was done superficially, and anterior. What I didn&#39;t see, however, was skin trauma bleeding which may or may not have been apparent. The knife may have been slightly dull which would explain the number of attempts to get through the anterior part of the throat. Either way, it is brutal.</p>

<p>I agree.  Still photos are much easier to photoshop than video.  I were going to behead someone on camera, I&#39;d make it all one solid take, from the first cut until the body is lifeless, so there could be no question that it really happened.  </p>

All the video cuts, using multiple cameras and of course omitting the actual beheading are making me question whether this was real at all. Why would they do that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you kidding? The look on his face was wretched before he was beheaded. People act very strange when they know they are about to be executed. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=499_1407274030">Watch this video NSFL</a> . These guy don&#39;t put up any sort of fight. &quot;My turn to get my throat slit? OK, I&#39;ll be right there&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why they faded to black when his head actually came off. Although I have seen them blur out gory parts of dead bodies in the propaganda videos they make. They probably want people to focus more on the speech than the gore. They are probably aware that a lot of people who hate what ISIS stands for only watch the videos because they like gore and death. </p>

<p>I think it is real. I don&#39;t think they could logically pull of a hoax of that magnitude. </p>

<p>I looked on his Wikipedia page but that didn&#39;t exist prior to 8/19 and merely stated the headline that&#39;s been plastered all over the internet. It seems that he was rather high profile so why would his Wikipedia page be non-existent prior to the release of this video?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>ISIS didn&#39;t exist 2 years ago so how could ISIS have Foley?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t watched any of the videos because I saw a beheading once and it fucked me up for a very long time. We don&#39;t need to see stuff like that. I hit hurts the soul. But on the news page talking about it they had a still of him before being killed and I did note he looked disinterested.</p>

<p>I have seen that disinterested look on men about to be beheaded and I wondered if they drug them? I would be running and fighting for my life and force them to kill me before I let someone brutally saw my head off.</p>

<p>Also I want to know how painful it is to have your head cut off this way? </p>

<p>I really hate those bastards. They are animals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like CIA black flag operation.
Isis was conquering IRAQ for almost year - and yet almost zero negative news about them. THEN just after some major political shifting in IRAQ and re-deployment of US military &quot;advisors&quot; to iraq - BOOM mass-media were bombarded by anti-ISIS propaganda to gain support for new war. All in the matter of few days.</p>

<p>Dont be stupid - this is all politics. There are not good or bad guys. Just political forces with agendas.</p>

<p>ISIS 2 weeks ago: rebel forces in IRAQ ad Syria (btw they have beef with AL-qaida)
ISIS today: suddenly it becomes &quot;worst terrorist group&quot; - just like that... It seems that world needs new &quot;goal&quot; after WMD in Iraq, Al-qaida and Bin-laden...</p>

<p>Dont be stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Finally, someone I can talk to. I&#39;ve seen the video once(I then rewatched it several times obviously) and in the first 30 seconds I realised it was a fake. It really is but we can&#39;t prove it, maybe a photoshop master or someone that deals with these kind of propaganda bullshit.
This video is so smooth and clear, they&#39;re both wearing super clean clothes and the prisoner looks so healthy, his speach was flawless. There&#39;s editing involved with fade to black and everything. You&#39;re telling me that a sheep fucking terrorist has the gear, time and skill to make an edited video?
When he goes to cut his throat it fades to black, why? There&#39;s no reason to do so if you really want to scare America. Another strange thing is that there&#39;s a post on reddit telling people not to watch the video because it&#39;s too graphic and everybody agrees, also his mother says the same thing, not to watch it? What&#39;s there not to watch, There&#39;s nothing graphic about the video I&#39;ve seen. Is there any full video where they actually show the crime? Total and utter bullshit, I do apologise if there&#39;s an actual video of the real beheading and if there is I take back what I said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because the original footage was shot somewhere near Syria, doesn&#39;t mean it was edited there.  Alas, there are plenty of desktop-jihadis in Western nations willing to edit and upload the footage for the Islamic State.</p>

<p>Having said that, it could have been edited by them near where Foley was murdered.  All you need is a laptop, some software, and later on an internet connection.  Islamic State is not a ragtag terrorist group - they are a terrorist state (though mostly not formally recognised... yet).  They publish glossy full-colour magazines too, all quite professionally laid out:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me boil it down for you:</p>

<p>SHORT VERSION:
The increasing sophistication of terrorist/extremist videos (the use of lapel mics, multiple cameras, video editing, transitions, titles and effects) does not suggest or even imply that the videos are fake/false flag/CIA/Illuminati/whatever.  It is consistent with a wider trend.</p>

<p>LONGER VERSION:
Some people (such as yourself L3zer) think that the high(er) quality of this video is somehow suspicious.  It isn&#39;t.  These extremists are getting steadily better at packaging their message, across all media not just video (see the link in my previous post)</p>

<p>It&#39;s WORRYING and DEPRESSING that there are people out there shooting and editing beheading videos using the same hardware, software, plug-ins and processes I use to shoot and edit corporate videos and short films, but that&#39;s a rant for a different day.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve taught at a film school, and from a strictly production/post-production standpoint the quality of this IS video is entirely unremarkable in itself; I&#39;d rate the skills required at good high-school level or basic first-year diploma level.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, the fact that the video is in focus, shot on tripods, correctly exposed, with the victim and extremist miced up with lapels, etc, is a depressing milestone in a way, but only one of several I have seen over the years.  It is only a few steps up in quality from the typical beheading video of a few years ago, but that&#39;s not hard as those videos were usually handheld, barely edited, and often, by the time we saw them, tenth-generation re-encodes at 320x240 resolution sitting on rotten.com.  In terms of production quality it&#39;s all an improvement from there.</p>

<p>I still remember the first time I saw a beheading video that actually had titles and primitive overlays to block out the face of the beheader (over a decade ago I think).  At the time I was doubly disturbed by the video.  Obviously the brutal content of the footage was the cause of most of my horror.  But, as someone working in the video production arena,  it also greatly disturbed me that there were people out there smart enough and capable enough with technology and software to perform the tasks required to add titles, fades, overlays etc, and yet also be involved in the creation of such a repellent  video.</p>

<p>The Foley video is just another step down that same bafflingly incongruous path -- a path that has given us technologically savvy anti-western extremists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That fade to black struck me as odd too.  Other extremist videos are not exactly squeamish when it comes to showing the nadir of their inhumanity.</p>

<p>I can think of many &quot;non-conspiratorial&quot; explanations for that fade to black, but all my explanations suffer from the same core problem as the &quot;conspiratorial&quot; false-flag/CIA/etc explanations - they are speculations that are consistent with the evidence but untestable.</p>

<p>Anyway, here are three possible non-conspiratorial explanations for the fade to black:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They edited out poor Foley&#39;s final moments out of a sense of decency and respect for the Foley family and/or for the sensibilities of the viewers.  Yeah, I know, given the final shot of the beheaded young man this explanation seems preposterously unlikely, but I include it for completeness -- and it&#39;s no less likely than some of the conspiracy-based explanations.</p></li>
<li><p>They wanted to ensure that the video was shown on western TV.  This also seems a little unlikely -- and it didn&#39;t work: I&#39;m in Australia and the only thing mainstream TV show here is a single freeze-frame of Foley kneeling next to his soon-to-be murderer.  Nothing else, not even on subscription TV.  But it&#39;s possible they were misguided enough to think that editing out the actual killing would get them air time.</p></li>
<li><p>They botched the job, either through incompetence and/or Foley struggling at the last moment -- perhaps his murder may have been drawn out and (even more) unnecessarily cruel.  Pride is a big deal to these guys apparently, so perhaps the editor faded to black because they thought it made the Islamist look less like a &quot;scary murdering extremist&quot; and more like a &quot;bungling murdering butcher&quot;.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, as I said, there&#39;s no way to test any of the above explanations without access to the raw footage and people involved, not that I&#39;d particularly want to see it or meet them.  I for one actually hope the crazier conspiracies are true, and that no one was killed that day.  But I doubt it.</p>

<p>Perhaps one day a small special forces team will retrieve the footage for us and conduct interviews with the relevant persons, and the minor mystery of the jihadi-video-that-faded-to-black will be solved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Editing out the gruesomeness of the beheading defeats the purpose.  Propaganda like this is supposed to give the viewer a sense of dread.  Also, if it was botched, the effect iseven better.  The most horrific thing to me is seeing someone try to get away but ultimately their fight for life is futile.</p>

<p>And as others have pointed out, the media would have simply chopped out the execution.  24 hour news networks have few scruples.  They won&#39;t show the execution but they sure as hell will show those beginning moments.  </p>

<p>Also, if ISIS is as media savvy as they seem, they know there&#39;s other avenues in which explicit content can be viewed.  It&#39;s the internet.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why to me this video seems fake.  I don&#39;t know who would be behind its faking but no blood is a big tell to me.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no reasonable way for you to be able make such definite claims about the purpose of the beheading video, not with any real confidence, not unless you have a level of access to IS that you&#39;re not letting on to the rest of us.

<p>There are plausible non-conspiratorial explanations for why the actual killing was not shown in the video; explanations at least as plausible as those explanations revolving around the video being fake/false-flag/CIA/etc. </p>

<p>Logical, certainly. As I said several posts back: coming up with speculative explanations for the fade to black that are consistent with the evidence is easy (for example, maybe both their cameras failed just at the moment of the murder), but testing or falsifying such explanations is hard. Neither of us are able to do this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well then I think the U.S. should stop calling ISIS terrorists and start calling them, mildly scary-ists.</p>

<p>And I agree, it&#39;s less satisfying to say I don&#39;t know.  I don&#39;t know, but given the history of beheading videos, this one stands out as the exception to the rule.  It also makes me question how vicious the group really is, which in the states, is being considered the dogs of hell.  And I&#39;m sure they&#39;re bad.  I&#39;ve seen some pretty horrific things from the group.  However this video flies in the face of that perception.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if ISIS is trying to come off as more family friendly or what, but if they are, beheading people in the streets and threatening to raise the ISIS flag in the U.S. doesn&#39;t exactly point to a kinder, gentler ISIS that is focused less on terrorizing people to make them conform to their religious rhetoric, but focused more on winning the hearts and minds of people everywhere.  In other words, I believe a video like this would be counter productive to their nationalistic goals.   </p>

<p>That&#39;s why this video is confusing to me. </p>

Youtube is censoring all graphic videos of the Foley &quot;execution&quot; but this one is way more graphic and has been there a while.</p>

<p>This video is linked in the <a href="/r/morbid">/r/morbid</a> reality sub, so be warned that it is extremely graphic.  Thing is, it&#39;s not being censored on Youtube and is very relevant.</p>

<p>Compare this video to the Foley one and see what kind of mess this makes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if its fake or not... Regardless it certainly is a tactic used by IS to convey a message of &quot;Don&#39;t mess with us&quot; to the world. It should be understood though that this isn&#39;t unusual... This is just the nature of statecraft, think about all the nuclear weapons nations such as the US, Britain, Russia and Israel have. </p>

<p>But back to the question, it seems strange that Folley would give a speech which sounded so... submissive before he died. He didn&#39;t even shed a tear when talking about his family before arguably the greatest moment of his life - death. Maybe he had to say all that stuff to buy his life...</p>

To me, the speech gelt plausible and his expression before the beheading. The odd parts I immediately noticed were (1) The scraggly filter put on the Obama speech for no apparent reason, (2) The edit to not show the head being cut off, (3) No blood spewing, and (4) Foley&#39;s severed head looking kind of peaceful/alive.  Still looking for an analysis of how the severed head shot was faked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope it&#39;s a fake. But hopes apart, there are a few things we can&#39;t explain without an expert&#39;s opinion.</p>

<p>It would be great to have a doctor and a professional video editor to corroborate these theories. I agree on a few of them. No blood apparently - and I don&#39;t know about you guys, but when I cut myself (cooking or trying to open a jar in the worst way possible) I bleed like a pig. I&#39;ve seen shaving cuts bleeding more than that.</p>

<p>The behading being edited... Makes no sense to me. It&#39;s like - sorry for the comparison but seemed quite graphic to me - doing porn and editing the sex scenes out. If it&#39;s porn, it&#39;s porn. If it&#39;s a beheading, it&#39;s a beheading. Why leave the door open for so many questions? Again, makes no sense to me.</p>

<p>The only thing that makes me doubt is his face. The incredible amount of tension in his mouth and neck. Either he&#39;s a great actor or he thought it was for real.</p>

<p>Or it truly was.</p>

<ol>
<li>No Flag to show who they represent. </li>
<li>The guy speaks English instead of the normal Arabic.</li>
<li>No Music.</li>
<li>No second set of hands to help, because that knife is too tough to cut a head off with, without extra hands to help you. </li>
<li>NOT SHOWING THE BEHEADING, how can they show us how serious they are, by sending us a beheading video without a beheading in it. Its so easy to fake it if you do this way. All the clips at the start of the video show they already have a basic knowledge of editing, but why edit out the actual reason for the video. </li>
</ol>

<p>This video just seems so off to me. I think its staged or hoaxed. And the next guy in line didnt seem worried or scared at all either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had read somewhere that they would often stage &quot;mock&quot; beheadings for their captives, basically making it impossible for the hostage to ever know when exactly they would be killed. Foley had probably been through this many times before, and had become accustomed to leaving the ordeal alive every time... </p>

<p>I do find this video odd however, because of the fade to black upon the actual beheading. Either it is a psychological tactic (the benefit of which I have no idea) or a staging/fake. </p>

<p>I say this because the first beheading video I saw, pretty much scarred me for life. It was carried out by Al Qaeda. It showed every moment of the beheading... Apparently ISIS is suppose to be more hardcore then Al Qaeda, yet they edit the portion of the actual killing? How strange is that? </p>

And it doesn&#39;t matter if the guy in the vid was a lookalike or the real Foley.

<li><p>This was supposed to be another beheading video, among all other beheadings, why did it get so much hype?</p></li>
<li><p>They&#39;re in the middle of a desert, and audio is crystal clear. He actually got a microphone.</p></li>
<li><p>Camera is stable, it is not held by someone...maybe a tripod? Hmm..not usual.</p></li>
<li><p>Terrorist starts with a knife (black handle, rather short blade), after there is a different knife on the ground at the end.</p></li>
<li><p>Victim is very composed and not much emotion is shown considering he knows his fate.</p></li>
<li><p>Blood seems to take a long time to come out.</p></li>
<li><p>A few cuts in the video, maybe he forgot his next line?</p></li>
<li><p>Terrorist not looking menacing at all, nearly always looking at the ground a blinking slowly, like he&#39;s tired of retaking the footage or something. Also he is looking below the camera angle while he speaks.</p></li>
<li><p>Left the actual beheading part out.</p></li>
<li><p>Still image...How did blood get on the victim&#39;s both legs on his pants at the same exact level. Also, blood on the leg away from the camera look like a two/three fingers swipe of blood?</p></li>
<li><p>No blood on terrorist&#39;s hands/clothes when 2nd victim is introduced. Victim does not seem that tense neither after what he had just seen.</p></li>
<li><p>Great effect at the ending of the video.</p></li>

<p>I&#39;ve also never seen one covered so heavily in the media (don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s simply because he&#39;s an American)</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, even if this video is a staged bit of fakery to provide pretext to do work in Syria, I&#39;m alright with it because I really do believe Islam needs to be dragged kicking and screaming into the new millennium, but let&#39;s at least get Michael Bay on the job or something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking at this as a video editing point of view. 
<a href="http://truthuncensored.net/warning-graphic-breaking-american-journalist-james-wright-foley-beheaded-by-isis-in-chilling-video-to-obama/">Video I&#39;m referencing</a>
The beginning of the video has a filter on it to simulate a broadcast with fake &quot;static&quot; added here and there.  Subtitles added on top without these additional filters.  There is a fade out, and a fake &quot;transmission interrupted&quot; almost similar to a TV broadcast being turned off.</p>

<p>My question is, why go to all this trouble with these un-needed effects go get across this particular message?  The no blood is weird and the fadeout is weird but I don&#39;t understand the effects unless these terrorists are editing their footage with Sony Vegas before releasing it to the public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s fake, I&#39;m not sure if any of you have been around to the gore sites like DocumentingReality or anything, but there are videos on there of the Al-Qaeda beheading some journalists. Those videos were beyond gruesome, I actually cringe whenever I think of them, but in the videos they show the full on beheading. Blood everywhere, wheezing from trying to breathe, the body jerking each time the knife smashes against the spinal cord, etc.  Now, if ISIS is supposed to be ten-times more frightening than Al-Qaeda, why do they block out the actual murder? They&#39;re trying to show that they shouldn&#39;t be messed with, but they hide the very thing they&#39;re trying to scare us with? If they&#39;re trying to send a message, it&#39;s not exactly a very scary one compared to the past sending-a-message videos from their predecessor</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the video did not actually show the beheading, but faded to black at the appropriate moment. A subsequent frame purports to show Foley’s head propped up on his headless body. This video was staged, however, as proved by numerous researchers, and even admitted in the British press. According to a report in The Telegraph:…&quot;a study of the four-minute 40-second clip, carried out by an international forensic science company which has worked for police forces across Britain, suggested camera trickery and slick post-production techniques appear to have been used…no blood can be seen, even though the knife is drawn across the neck area at least six times&quot;.......Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s better if they show us the beheading huh it&#39;s more convincing right! C&#39;mon it&#39;s ISIS they made us think they&#39;re the Real Barbarian Beheading in front of the Camera will be easy as water for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But what if they want the people who&#39;ll actually scrutinize the video to say &quot;Hey, wait a minute, this looks staged&quot;? That would be the ultimate way to manipulate both the &#39;masses&#39; and those who think about it objectively. Shock the &#39;average Joe&#39; with images which inevitably end up splashed all over the media and make the less easily manipulated question whether their own government is lying and setting up an excuse for war.</p>

<p>Pure speculation, obviously. It&#39;s just something which crossed my mind a few times and I was wondering if anyone else had similar thoughts?</p>

<p>&quot;I said it&#39;s pointless &quot;having respect&quot; when clips of the video have already been all over the media and they&#39;re offering commentary blah blah blah&quot;</p>

<p>I meant respect towards taking a beheading with zero media commentary, (as just the video itself), and then looking for any possible little thing, (like bad editing, or too good of a job at editing), to make this seem like a conspiracy. Like these animals care to play the conspiracy game right now. Do you need it explained in any other bite sized chunks?

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t fucking say the media released it, chief.</p>

<p>I said it&#39;s pointless &quot;having respect&quot; when clips of the video have already been all over the media and they&#39;re offering commentary blah blah blah</p>

<p>You&#39;ve already edited your original comment, though, so responding to your obtuse follow-up is an obvious waste of time. I&#39;m going to go ahead and end this exchange before you make it any stupider.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read that a user&#39;s friend in isreal said that there is an unedited video that&#39;s about 7 min long with no blackout during the beheading. Where could one ask around to Israeli redditors if any others in the area had seen that one as well? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another bullshit excuse to lend some suspension of disbelief to the back story of ISIS.  Make people think they would have the time or inclination to produce a &#39;made for television&#39; beheading.  If you&#39;re going to make an example, the Islamic Fundamentalist way is full gore, full shock value.</p>
