Ever since I watched this guys video and found out he&#39;s also been in these riots as an officer and was also part of that staged event with CNN, I have had a feeling that this guy is connected to something big. I&#39;m not usually one to be up in arms about things in the news, cause it&#39;s always a bullshit distraction, but something weird is going on here involving this guy.</p>

<p>Edit: Good work everyone on the research effort. This story still has a lot of unknowns, but we know a lot more now than we did when this started. IMO we need to start using the chat more often to coordinate our research efforts when stories like this break.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m about 100% sure that with this all of a sudden coverage of police brutality issues being shown on the media, that its basically going to attempt to be used as an excuse to demilitarize police(which I&#39;m for) but with that will also weaken any potential defence against a massive push for the US to turn into a federal police state. Its all speculation but anytime the regular media is covering something there is always a hidden reason/meaning to it due to their controlled nature. Also note that recent pushes to strip the use of and ownership of drones by civilians is a huge concern because those would be eyes in the sky that they don&#39;t own or control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly what I&#39;ve been thinking.</p>

<p>Do you hear all the calls for bringing the military in because, &quot;They can handle civilians better than the police!1!!1!1&quot; - which in all honesty, they normally can. </p>

<p>This is being pushed across reddit and likely TV as well, but I couldn&#39;t vouch for that[tv] as I don&#39;t watch it.. if anyone has any clips of this please share!</p>

<p>However, I doubt that it will go from police-&gt;military; it will in my eyes go police-&gt;dhs &amp; company. The vehicles &amp; weapons will go to DHS instead of police, &quot;Because police hurt people and we want the border to FINALLY be secure&quot; - and most people will agree with them. From there, just move the border checkpoints back another 10 miles every year. </p>

<p>The military absolutely <em>cannot</em> &quot;handle civilians better than the police&quot;. The military attacks enemies of the state. The police defends the civilians of the state. When the military become the police, the civilians tend to become the enemies of the state. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the Holy fucking shit revelation that CNN and the government doesn&#39;t want you to know. Since at least 1985 Dan Page has been a Srgt. for the United states Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command, what do they do? They run propaganda and Psychological operations on americans on american soil. This is the what they don&#39;t want us to know. The faked staged scene with Don Lemmings used a military person to stage the event Page posing as a cop. From the lectures he does as he also is involved in riling up the oath keepers and soveriegn movements, its pretty clear the government with CNN and Dan Page have intentions. What are they, from what I and many friends helping online can gather, the only thing they could be trying to do is start some kind of &quot;Racewar&quot; or racially driven revolt that allows them to impose martial law. Not that we are not already, NDAA has suspended Habeus corpus, to many law makers in the last century that is a kin to Martial law. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/.../United_States_Army_Civil">http://en.wikipedia.org/.../United_States_Army_Civil</a>...</p>

<p>EDIT Recent info I have discovered, Its a damn good possibility that the Oath Keepers organization is a government psyop, as this guy and many others at the top have been exposed. They are probably doing it to keep an eye on people with those sentiments that are not on their payroll. This is big! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you read my comment? I can attest to there being Russian ex military trainees at ft Leonard wood in early 2013. I was there. Pay attention to the legal framework the attorney General is building. I think what they are trying to do is gain legal precedence from which to prosecute state level police. Does a case exist where federal prosecutors have the legal causeway to charge state level police? My best guess is that they are trying to encroach on the states rights to litigate their own employees. This cannot be charged as a race issue but one of excessive force. They are using race as a catalyst for the population to agree to send this legal matter to the federal level and thus by create the circumstances to then prosecute state level police in the future at a higher level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Makes sense...start a revolt, declare martial law, then brutally crush it with your militarized police force, that was brought up to do just that. That must have been what Page was talking about in the video...when he was talking about martial law..What did he call it again? Emergency Police Powers? 
He just got relieved from duty: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/22/police-officer-video-relieved-black-people-ferguson-dan-page">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/22/police-officer-video-relieved-black-people-ferguson-dan-page</a></p>

<p>As I don&#39;t work for the DoD at the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/st-louis/military-personnel/">National Personnel Records Center, Military Personnel Records</a> (NPRC-MPR), <strong>in St. Louis</strong>...nor am I employed with the <a href="http://www.stlouisco.com/LawandPublicSafety/PoliceDepartment">St. Louis County Police Department</a>, then NO, I can&#39;t <em>prove</em> who &#39;CSM Dan Page&#39; is (either). I&#39;m simply going with what he himself recently stated...that he <strong>resigned/retired</strong> from service, but still had to get clearance from the Army to speak at that particular OK roundup. Thus, if there&#39;s anything inaccurate in the comment above, then it&#39;s because we&#39;re <em>all</em> still awaiting confirmation from the Fourth Estate &amp; the Pentagon. I&#39;ll suggest again that you not hold your breath.</p>

<p>One <em>might</em> note how <a href="http://classicalwisdom.com/diogenes-of-sinope/">Diogenes dealt with Alexander the Great</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;Diogenes was bathing in the morning sunlight, Alexander appeared before him. The King of Macedonia asked Diogenes if there was anything he (a man who seemingly had everything) could do for him.</p>

<p>The philosopher responded, &#39;Yes, stand out of my light&#39;.&quot; </p>

<p>If you end up providing something I see as reasonable, I will indeed feel like a dick. Thing is your friend will probably never message me.

<p>Peace, and enjoy your insecurity complex. You&#39;re a sad man; man up for once in your life and admit you&#39;re a karma/attention whore trying to manipulate people with clearly bullshit lies. You&#39;re scum in my opinion, just plain scum. </p>

<p>Not sure about the whole orgs leadership but this psyop warpig IMO is clearly fishing for personal info on  people that fill the ill machines sick definition profile for &quot;potential domestic terrorists&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XA_yW7Z5OM#t=853"><strong>@ 14:13 of the video</strong></a> warpig hands out some seemingly psyop sounding fear based hooked carrot on a stick &quot;proposed new constitution&quot; that he claims has &quot;already been drafted&quot; &quot;ordered under George Bush&quot; &quot;1 draft of 8 drafts&quot; &quot;the new constitution is already to go&quot; while driveling about needing the copies passed out back &amp; saying &quot;Just take a quick look @ it&quot; &quot;please do not hang on to it&quot; pass it or I&#39;ll come by &amp; take it out of your hand if I see you holding it too long.&quot; He speaks of not letting anyone go through it page by page. Someone asks if they can just get in on google &amp; he says yes you can get it yourself but does not detail how.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XA_yW7Z5OM#t=2203">36:43 of the video</a> psyop warpig speaks about a honey trap. the bait is so enticing they need to take it, &quot;but it wil kill you.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XA_yW7Z5OM#t=3043">50:44 of the video</a> he lays a honey trap by saying, &quot;if you want anything that i&#39;ve got&quot; &amp; then seeks names phone nubers &amp; addresses.  lol I am sure many would love to read the new constiution lol he baited the trap with. <em>IMO He &amp; his owners are going to burn more than copies to send out.</em></p>

<p>This warpigs spiel is IMO clearly a psyop. I would like to thank all here who have contributed to this thread productively to sew this asshat warpigs psyop pseudo patriot patch onto a BS flag. </p>

<p>IMO the Oath Keepers Org is clearly being used as a baited trap to gain info, just as FBI warpigs go to Islamic groups such as mosques to try to entice Muslims to do BS such as take oaths to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Base">&quot;the base&quot;</a>, all while milking personal info on the members. </p>

It won&#39;t convince us. The lies don&#39;t work anymore. The emperor has no clothes.               </p>

<p>Because even those whose were blindly faithful a decade ago now question everything. But the PTB will still commit whatever military resources they can before domestic pressure grows too large.           </p>

<p>9/11 was a poisoned chalice for the PTB. Sure, they got everything they wanted very quickly. And for a brief period, everyone was too scared to oppose the rhetoric.<br/>
But just as their behaviour in the financial markets, they were too greedy. They have zero awareness of how they&#39;re truly perceived by the masses.<br/>
They think that if MSM is still bleating their propaganda then we&#39;re all on board and willing participants/victims.              </p>

<p>This time, it&#39;s different. Their weapons might be stronger, their influence more ingrained. But every previous US initiated war was different. We didn&#39;t know any better back then. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So my messages reappeared mysteriously, not all of them though, I still need to check with him to see what I&#39;m missing and if his came back at all. What I found even more interesting was that he was breaking the shit down for me about the military equipment, but I wasn&#39;t getting that shit at that time, and when my messages reappeared I found something in there that he had written that I didn&#39;t see and its out of place, like there should have been a lot more around it, but its like a 8 hour gap then this      &quot;check that 1033 reporting site and look at Kentucky. A refrigerator worth $2.4M? and the NSN number doesn&#39;t exist&quot; Then that is where, when I woke up, shit was totally blank and we were talking on the phone freaking out about just getting patriot acted. This shit he is looking into seems pretty good I think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn. This is pretty enthralling. I&#39;ll be honest, I&#39;m not sure what to think (that&#39;s the best part, right? Not knowing what you&#39;re supposed to believe because you&#39;re determined to make your own analysis of the information).</p>

<p>As contradictory as what I&#39;m about to say is to what I just said, I&#39;m not sure what we should be most leery of in this situation. There&#39;s the obvious, fabricated race war/black-white division that can be used as a tool to further military/police/government power, there&#39;s the disgusting notion that the media, government, and secret organizations are creating controversy and manipulating actual events to fit the narrative they want to achieve the end result they want, the incredulous situation where there are real people witnessing this bullshit and being quiet/being kept quiet/supporting it, or the fact that there are real people who believe that these actions are for the best. It is truly enlightening.</p>

<p>Remember guys and gals, that we can&#39;t sit idly by while there are obvious events that need to be brought to mainstream attention. As clear as it seems to us that there is foul play involved in our country (and the world), we need to do two things to guarantee the preservation of the good that is in humanity; we must try everyday to discover the truth for not only ourselves but for our fellow man, and we must remember that just because someone doesn&#39;t agree/believe/understand what we&#39;re trying to show them doesn&#39;t mean that they are in on the evil or they are stupid. You can&#39;t force the &quot;truth&quot; down someone&#39;s throat. Evil men and women have been trying to do it to civilization since it&#39;s inception, and it hasn&#39;t been accomplished. We&#39;ve all experienced a moment where it finally clicked that there was more to it than what we&#39;ve been witnessing and what we&#39;ve been told, and that&#39;s why we are here now. We refused to accept someone else&#39;s reality and belief. So, remember when you&#39;re at a relative&#39;s house or watching TV with a friend that you can&#39;t tell them what is the truth (you&#39;d essentially be doing what we are so disgusted by; people telling us what is true/untrue and what to believe). You must give them the tools to make their own decision. </p>

<p>P.S. Great post. The original and the followup. If we could have more content like this, I think the outsider of Reddit would consider us a legitimate and logical source of information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, here&#39;s what I see: Random guy somehow finds random video of a Psyop agent specifically outlining a military takeover of the United States. Video appears to be at least several months old, and lends credibility to several prevailing &#39;conspiracy therories&#39;. Video specifically mentions beheading (days after a supposed beheading) and stirs up significant anti-Muslim sentiment/fear (on the same day Chuck Hagel pushes for war against ISIS). Random guy somehow makes the connection between Psyop agent and an unidentified (not wearing a badge) police officer from a CNN news clip that aired several days prior. Random guy posts his find on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Post makes front page. The next day CNN (National MSM) airs portions of the psyop video. &#39;Officer&#39; is supposedly fired. Seeing the two videos back to back, it&#39;s obviously the same guy. But randomly making the connection between the two videos? Amazing. The CNN video is obviously fake, the Psyop video is a little too &#39;on the nose&#39;. And then the whole thing gets National media coverage? There&#39;s something unsettling about the whole situation. I guess my point is, given that you are posting in this sub, do you really expect me to not at least consider whether or not YOU are part of a Psyop? Let&#39;s face it, this whole thing is pretty incredible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, if you&#39;re right, if this was some kind of layered, interactive psyop starring Reddit and The Black Child, what is the angle?</p>

<p>Nationally outing the white-hat Dan Page? Nationally outing the psyop scum Dan Page? Testing interactive social media to news media manipulation? Was Dan Page intentionally making himself worthless to the feds? Something else?</p>

<p>I think time will help wound the heels, in this case. Let&#39;s keep a limelight on the fallout.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s definitely something going on here. I have some ideas percolating, but I need to do some research. I&#39;m considering making a post to sort it out. I need to go over the relevant posts again, dig through the comments, watch the relevant videos, and have a look at today&#39;s CNN coverage. In the meantime I&#39;ll leave you this to chew on: Without the video of Dan Page the asshole cop on CNN, does the video of Dan Page the truth-telling Oath Keeper have a chance in hell of hitting the front page? </p>

<p>I believe he was aware of being recorded at the oath keeper speech. <del>The footage seems to be feigning discretion (weird angle), but the recording device seems to be only 3 or 4 feet away from his face, panning.</del></p>

<p>Nevermind. It&#39;s just shit camerawork. The group records a lot of these speeches.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe you were just a messenger. But, are you willing to consider you/the Black Child/your anon source may have also been pawns?</p>

<p>Transparency regarding events and correspondences leading up to your discovery of the video would be very interesting and may help quiet any questions about your motivations.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to push you for any information you aren&#39;t willing to share. And nobody here wants to compromise anyone&#39;s anonymity. I&#39;d hesitate to disclose even my timezone. </p>

<p>Thanks for this interesting series of posts. Also, when your Reddit link pops up on CNN the next day, I think it&#39;s well past time to put down Facebook and rely on trusted, encrypted communication. I would go full paranoid and use something private or transparently decentralized. Own your communication.</p>

<p>Confidence in your security can help take the real target off your back and reduce irrational paranoia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the Holy fucking shit revelation that CNN and the government doesn&#39;t want you to know. Since at least 1985 Dan Page has been a Srgt. for the United states Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command, what do they do? They run propaganda and Psychological operations on americans on american soil. This is the what they don&#39;t want us to know. The faked staged scene with Don Lemmings used a military person to stage the event Page posing as a cop. From the lectures he does he also is involved in riling up the oath keepers and soveriegn movements, its pretty clear the government with CNN and Dan Page have intentions. What are they, from what I and many friends helping online can gather, the only thing they could be trying to do is start some kind of &quot;Racewar&quot; or racially driven revolt, that allows them to impose martial law or possibly try to aquire federal authorty to prosecute police officers, which would likely mean they would eventually try to make all police forces, state police, which are federally ran, at that point kiss your 2nd amendment goodbye. Not that we are not already under martial law, NDAA has suspended Habeus corpus, to many law makers in the last century that is a kin to Martial law.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Civil_Affairs_and_Psychological_Operations_Command">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Civil_Affairs_and_Psychological_Operations_Command</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you to an extent, howevere in a way this is very much a war of right versus left as has been evidenced by the majority of post-war foreign and domestic policy. It was the anti-left Red Scare that really got the ball rolling, then there was Gladio, and the overthrow and subversion of leftist governments in Eastern and Southern Europe, South and Central America, the Middle East, Africa, South East Asia, and Australia. Domestically there was the assassination of MLK and COINTELPRO which specifically and predominantly targeted leftists. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that liberalism is anyway superior to conservatism, I feel both ideologies are viable as a basis for governance, it&#39;s just that there has been an informal and subversive policy among right leaning individuals in the US government for decades to suppress left leaning dissent.</p>

<p>They chopped it up to show his bits on domestic violence. That isn&#39;t what&#39;s important!</p>

<p>I&#39;m waiting for this to gain more traction. For the media to start focusing on the important questions. </p>

<p>Why is he a  &quot;whistleblower&quot; during the day, &amp;amp; cop at night? The rabbit hole is deeeeper than Sasha Grey&#39;s niddily bits. </p>

<p>But what can you expect, I guess. Fear mongering will always grab more attention. I can see it now. </p>

<p><em>&quot;FERGUSON COP TELLS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS TO &#39;GET OVER IT &amp;amp; SHOOT EACH OTHER.&quot;</em></p>

<p>OP did a good job with this, allegations of him being an enemy instead of ally aside. </p>

<p>I made a couple of posts to that effect yesterday, but the situation is a little more complex...</p>

<p>His rank was accurate - but the reference to the unit is confusing.</p>

<p>Command Sergeant Major ;
418th Civil Affairs Battalion (Belton, MO)</p>

<p>is organized under:
308th Civil Affairs Brigade ;
353rd Civil Affairs Command</p>

<p>Those actually were under special ops (USASOC) until 2006. Now they are under the reserve command (USARC). The active units still report into special ops, but most of CA is reserve.</p>

<p>His claim to have been CSM of AFRICOM might not be entirely specious. 418 was involved in AFRICOM, and he could possibly have been acting in that capacity on a temporary basis at some point. He had the rank.</p>

<p>In any event, his history is in Civil Affairs, and that work differs considerably from the traditional concept of a Green Beret.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My opinion has changed so many times I forgot which side I was on. I have wanted to say this after thinking about it for a while. If we forget about the possible staged scenario with Lemmings, and just focus on him as a cop and an oath keeper. The media said he was a bigot for saying &quot;Black little perverts&quot; when its blatantly obvious he said &quot;black robed perverts&quot; speaking of supreme court judges. They are willfully lying about this guy, why? You would have to be retarded to think he said that, especially if you were paying even a tiny bit attention to the context. Not only that but after seeing his carvan to midnight show he seemed like anything but a racist. If he doesn&#39;t sue somebody for this shit there is some real motherfuckery going on. So I don&#39;t know, if he takes this lying down there is something going on, like they sent him to secure a base in antartica or some shit. If he lawyers up and says fuck you shit heads I want my reparations? I&#39;m getting behind him 100%. Nothing he said though was racist in any freaking way I don&#39;t know how they came up with that shit.</p>

<p>just a fucking racist sexist nutjob hanging with other racist sexist nutjobs, but they give him &quot;power&quot; in his little shit life because of the attention. </p>

<p>where things get tricky is that he actually has that first encounter with don lemon. he pushes him back, but then lets him go and lemon walks forward again. the fuck was that about? an &quot;example&quot; of how force works or what? it just seems so random and stupid and lemon is clearly not fearing him at all.  so it would SEEM they were working together...</p>

<p>so if they were, then why all this shit after the fact? if that guy is a truther why is he also working lemon? and if working together why would lemon come out with the story on him? its all a bunch of stupidity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;my reddit post yesterday went viral and the youtube video exposed him someone recognized him on CNN. Before its news picked it up and now he is being sacrificed for the good of america. lmfao! <strong>If you wanna see it share it look at my post history. Right now facebook messages are acting fucking crazy on my computer.</strong> <em>maybe yours too.</em> PLEASE SHARE&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s not acceptable evidence in my opinion. I claim liar, sorry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My opinion has changed so many times I forgot which side I was on. I have wanted to say this after thinking about it for a while. If we forget about the possible staged scenario with Lemmings, and just focus on him as a cop and an oath keeper. The media said he was a bigot for saying &quot;Black little perverts&quot; when its blatantly obvious he said &quot;black robed perverts&quot; speaking of supreme court judges. They are willfully lying about this guy, why? You would have to be retarded to think he said that, especially if you were paying even a tiny bit attention to the context. Not only that but after seeing his carvan to midnight show he seemed like anything but a racist. If he doesn&#39;t sue somebody for this shit there is some real motherfuckery going on. So I don&#39;t know, if he takes this lying down there is something going on, like they sent him to secure a base in antartica or some shit. If he lawyers up and says fuck you shit heads I want my reparations? I&#39;m getting behind him 100%. Nothing he said though was racist in any freaking way I don&#39;t know how they came up with that shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you really think a dolt like me, could put concise thoughts together like that? Now you are just trolling. I&#39;m no longer giving you any attention. because you could have made that much more believable. I think you lost big guy. I can&#39;t even tell what some of those words mean, much less put them together in any order. just wow. Give him your downvote back. He has great ideas and he is smart. Let me ask you this? Do you like football?
His first cousin more like his brother really, is a pro football player. It may or may not be the first string quarterback that blew out his ACL last weekend. Probably ending his career, still wanna downvote the guy? You don&#39;t feel sorry for him at all?</p>
