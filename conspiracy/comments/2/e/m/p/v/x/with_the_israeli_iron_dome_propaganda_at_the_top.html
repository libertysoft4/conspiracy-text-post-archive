        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM0J0LI1ymA">This video by the Paulstal Service</a> makes an extraordinarily compelling argument for this theory.</p>

<p>From the video&#39;s description:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are told that Hamas missiles are being intercepted by the almost god-like Iron dome system, which intercepts allegedly 90% of the missiles launched toward Israel...Why lie about that?</p>

<p>What proof is there that Iron Dome actually is hitting missiles in the first place? Well, there actually isn&#39;t any, the few Hamas missiles actually ever launched (Hamas is a group created by and controlled by the state of Israel) do not in fact even have warheads, and are basically hollow pipes and fireworks as has been proven time and time again.</p>

<p>Well, it turns out the &quot;Iron Dome&quot; interceptor missiles are a similar scam. They aren&#39;t intercepting anything, but instead are exploding in thin air, making people feel they are intercepting alleged Hamas rockets, when in reality they&#39;re essentially billions of dollars worth of American taxpayer money self-detonating in the air.</p>

<p>A group of Israeli skeptics asked the Israeli government to see the thermal imaging proof that the rockets were in fact intercepting other rockets, and they were denied. </p>

<p>There is no reason to withhold said proof, which is further evidence that there are no &quot;Hamas rockets&quot; being intercepted by Iron Dome, and Iron Dome is just a fireworks system.</p>

<p>But why? Why would Israel do this? Well, the answer is obvious:</p>

<p>The reason for the fake Hamas &quot;missile attacks&quot; and the phony Iron dome system is to keep the Israeli population in fear and thinking there is a legitimate attack on their lives (sound familiar?).</p>

<p>It&#39;s to make them hate the Palestinians, and allow the actual ground invasion to take place, which will kill hundreds of thousands eventually, as well as to put in place the &quot;no go zone&quot; which essentially eliminates half of Gaza to residential habitation.</p>

<p>It is also to guarantee billions of dollars of US funding &quot;protecting Israel&quot;, and to make the American people feel Israel is in fact under attack, and to make the American people the money we are sending them (the Israelis) to protect themselves from the non-existent Hamas rocket threat is being well spent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And finally, check out this incredible article: <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/middle-east/12772-israeli-expert-says-iron-dome-defence-is-a-hoax">Israeli expert says Iron Dome defence is a hoax</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An Israeli scientist and award-winning security expert has called the Iron Dome missile defence system &quot;the biggest hoax the world has seen&quot;.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Moti Shefer, &quot;Today, there is no missile which can intercept other missiles or rocket-propelled grenades, and the Iron Dome is a light audio system which blocks Israeli public opinion and, of course, itself. </p>

<p>In fact, all the explosions that we have seen in the atmosphere are self-destruction. The Iron Dome did not launch any rocket that could intercept at least one missile fired from Gaza.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k8VT-YUTMQ">The Democracy Now video</a>, provided by <a href="/u/narcoticdruid">/u/narcoticdruid</a>, many thanks!</p>

<p>From the video description:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While U.S. news anchors, pundits and politicians have repeatedly extolled the efficacy of the Iron Dome in deflecting rocket attacks, the acclaimed physicist Theodore Postol says there is no evidence Iron Dome is actually working. </p>

<p>He estimates the Iron Dome, which is partially built by Raytheon, intercepts just 5 percent of rockets fired at Israel. A professor of science, technology and national security policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Postol is an expert in missiles, missile defenses, and other aspects of modern warfare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Raytheon...you don&#39;t say...</p>

<p>I phrased this title cautiously by using the word &quot;may&quot;...</p>

<p>It just boggles my mind that the evidence <em>does</em> seem to support this theory, and that Israelis <em>themselves</em> are beginning to question the Iron Dome.</p>

<p>It would be a simple matter to provide the thermal imaging to shut down this type of speculation, but by refusing they&#39;re only fueling it...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they had actually intercepted rockets, they would be raining all over that neighborhood.  Missile interception systems pretty much just shoot shrapnel into the incoming object and render it useless, then they fall from the sky.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen piles of missiles and missile accessories from these intercepts?  Nope, <strong>never</strong>.  Just pictures of individual, homemade, large bottle rockets that land in parking lots and do 0 damage (save for the scuff mark they leave in the poor asphalt :&#39;( )</p>

<p>Edit: For the record I&#39;m sure there have been actual rocket attacks that actually killed people in Israel.  Who fired them, and where the missiles originated from, I haven&#39;t the foggiest.  No one can show me really solid proof either way.  Point being they are few and far between, and more often than not, the equivalent of bottle rockets.</p>

<p>1) where is Hamas getting the material for all of these supposed thousands of rockets? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also is there a reason why the hamas rockets do not leave a trail? Are they just lobbed up and have no propellant?  With no warhead and no propellant it doesn&#39;t sound like much of a rocket. Sounds like a cannon ball to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I think they are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1Um3xJWGso">launched</a> very quickly with lots of propellant that burns very quickly, so they are just riding on the initial launch for the majority of the journey.</p>

<p>The Iron Dome leaves a trail because it is a missile and it is better for the guided missile to have propulsion the majority of the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I&#39;m sure they&#39;d love to touch it if they could.  But that would require some actual proof which is where they&#39;d run into some problems.</p>

<p>It&#39;s strange, I&#39;d never given this &quot;theory&quot; much credence but now as I&#39;ve looked into it more and more today it almost seems obvious.  I mean, we already knew that Hamas was an Israeli creation, we <em>never</em> see actual damage from the &quot;rockets&quot; in Tel Aviv or elsewhere, and (as the other guy pointed out) no other country has bothered to order an &quot;Iron Dome&quot; of their own, despite its supposedly incredible technology.</p>

<p>And it makes perfect sense as to why they&#39;d use it - much easier to indoctrinate a populace who believes it&#39;s under constant attack from some vague enemy and believes the only reason it&#39;s able to survive is with the aid and defense of its government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure I saw this great <a href="http://youtu.be/1k8VT-YUTMQ?t=1m58s">democracy now piece</a> posted here awhile back that clearly presents the evidence for the system&#39;s inefficiency.  For the first few minutes he talks about how the current warning systems and bomb shelters alone are a very effective defense against incoming rockets.  Around the 6 minute mark he explains what they observe and why the interceptors don&#39;t hit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We occasionally, <em>very</em> occasionally, see an iron dome interceptor rising in a near vertical trajectory.  That is the only engagement geometry where the iron dome has a non-zero chance of destroying the rocket...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On another note it&#39;s sad and frustrating to see so many people in that <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a> thread ogling over what they perceive to be a marvel of engineering, rather than protesting about what is, in reality, a huge waste of taxpayer dollars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t doubt that the big firecrackers are being fired by somebody, maybe even the Palestinians, but I doubt that the Iron Dome system is intercepting more than a small fraction of them.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s suppose it is intercepting all of them, for the sake of argument. This isn&#39;t the case, but let&#39;s say it is. What is the result.</p>

<p>Hollow tubes with no warheads are being blown up in the air, high up in the air. Then what happens? The pieces of metal from the tubes rain down on israel over a wide area. How is this less destructive than a single hollow tube falling in a street or even on a roof? Instead of one projectile falling down, you get dozens, probably hundreds of projectiles.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think the opposite is true.  I highly doubt that the Israeli government wants the masses (and/or its own citizens) doubting the legitimacy of the Iron Dome/Hamas rockets.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a lot easier to indoctrinate a young populace into a bloodthirsty mentality when they think they&#39;re under constant threat of death from some vague outside force.  Even many militant Zionist Israelis would likely balk at some of their orders if it came out that the &quot;Hamas rockets&quot; didn&#39;t actually exist and its government was lying to all of them about the Iron Dome.</p>

<p>&quot;Faking&quot; the Iron Dome would have the added benefit of making people dependent upon and appreciative for their government who they believe is the only thing standing in the way of them and a missile.</p>

<p>And then there would be the additional benefit for the government in the form of US taxpayer money that&#39;s funneled to Israel ostensibly for the Iron Dome.  If it was fake, it wouldn&#39;t require billions of dollars in upkeep or investment, and so that would basically just be free money.</p>

<p>Not saying all of this is <em>definitely</em> the case but I think it&#39;s at least possible (if not likely).  I don&#39;t see any reason why the Israeli government would want people thinking that the Iron Dome doesn&#39;t work or that &quot;Hamas rockets&quot; are fictional.</p>

<p>Then please encourage the Israeli government to release thermal image recordings proving the interception of a Hamas rocket. </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty obvious that they are eager to show the severe and imminent threat the Palestinians/Hamas pose to the Israeli people and publish any fact  that proves this. So why would they not use a simple technology such as thermal imaging to empirically prove the level of threat that these rockets impose?</p>
