    <div class="md"><p>Whats the word, participatory economics?</p>

<p>Problem with our free trade capitalism is that the men in charge have complete control and the labourers(proletariat) are stuck in a system they have extremely little control or say in(you can quit and work for another corporation).</p>

<p>This is all working as intended, if you watched the &quot;Human Resources&quot; doc from last week they lay out a lot of the framework that was conceived to put us and the world in the current state it is in.</p>

<p>This is still all rather new economics in the scope of human history. Since the Industrial revolution we have built up a system slowly and surely that favors the wealthy. It works this way because America was founded on the principles to enforce this protection of wealth concentration. <a href="http://www.historyisaweapon.com/">http://www.historyisaweapon.com/</a></p>

<p>If we want to see a change in the dynamics of the economic system in place the only proven method is war against those in power. But that method of regime change only worked in the pre industrialized world, we have no successful example of how a group of people can win over and change a government who has such mass concentrations of wealth and power as America does in the 21st century. Throughout the past 100 years laws have been created or abolished to reinforce this system so as to protect the interests of those with power. The move of corporations from mere business &quot;entities&quot; to having equal rights as human beings is the greatest mark of how grossly corrupted the US government has become.</p>

<p>Factions are the greatest threat to a Republic. Our rich forefathers feared the growing discontent among the poor factions and so redirected their anger towards the crown of England, regardless of the fact that once removed from the empire they established the same laws and protections to ensure the continuation of their wealth and power, the factions of the time were misled into believing that this new America would be different from the previous establishment.</p>

<p>The use of divide and conquer is the American Gov. modus operandi. Do not become satisfied with directing your anger away from those in power. They would have us direct our anger outwards to other nations(terrorism/immigration) or amongst our own factions(ex. red v blue).</p>

<p>So I have no great answer to all the problems we face in changing this system to a system that can be perceived as better but I can say that factions are the downfall of any government and if you want real change figure out your goals, find a faction that supports them and focus your energies on TPTB not on other factions.</p>

The point is that any regulation on personal wealth (just read up on the inheritance tax shit storm) would be met with loud cries of socialism, and that would play pretty well in the US right now with a black, democratic president.</p>

<p>This is exactly where you lost me. This is not realistic, rational, or in any way a conspiracy. It&#39;s doomsaying, just a different spin.</p>

<p>Buy a bunker, guns, and water. And then watch as the world keeps spinning while you wait for it to end. Don&#39;t worry though, thousands of people (both smarter and dumber then you) throughout history have predicted the same thing, and been just as wrong.</p>

<p>If they were, then yes it would be the biggest conspiracy in the world. Also the most rediculous strategy I have ever heard of in my life. <strong>What government wants to kill their workforce? Who would produce their goods, sell their products, and clean up their waste?</strong></p>

<p>This is as true as saying that you can buy a lottery ticket and end up rich. Sure, it is &quot;possible&quot;, but it&#39;s not realistic. In fact, I wonder what the ratio of people who &quot;worked their way from the bottom&quot; to lottery winners is?</p>

<p>Poor people generally think the same way!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t get that angle at all, my apologies.</p>

<p>Also maybe instead of calling me an idiot, you could instead try to educate me. </p>

<p>I though our community would understand that, seeing as being called a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is a derisive slur in mainstream society, and offers nothing to the debate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it is, but that&#39;s not the point. The point is that any regulation on personal wealth (just read up on the inheritance tax shit storm) would be met with loud cries of socialism, and that would play pretty well in the US right now with a black, democratic president.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong, I&#39;m saying the US absolutely will not support this, poor or rich alike.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mistake. </p>

<p>Also killing billions of people makes no kind of rational, physical, or economical sense in any way. The pool of wealth they siphon off needs to be large. </p>

<p>Being a billionaire in a world where the most valuable thing is food/shelter/clothing seems a lot less appealing then a world where they can get all that, and Bugatti&#39;s, Yachts, and thousand dollar an hour escorts.</p>
