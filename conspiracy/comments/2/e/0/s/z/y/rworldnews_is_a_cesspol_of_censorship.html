<li><p>Mods are now deleting threads in such a fashion that the original posters still believes his thread is up. Only if you ask another user or log on from a different account you realize your thread has been deleted. Clear bad faith and shady behavior.</p></li>

<p>This is important because <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> has more than 6 million users. Please help spread the word and expose these manipulative idiots mods and admins of <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>.</p>

The content must be recent world news and it must have no pornography. That is all. You can editorialize if you want as long as the story and source are good. We don&#39;t delete anything unless it is from a blogsite, or porn. The subscribers decide to let something live or to kill it. As it should be.</p>

<p>The reason for removal was valid. It was not 225 survivors, it was a total of 225 survivors <em>and their descendants</em>, which is a very different thing. </p>

<p>You can make up whatever explanations or excuses you want, but they were right to remove it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of what I&#39;ve written in the last week has never been seen on reddit. </p>

<p>Most of that was right here on r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>When I post something, with important  links,  I have the capacity to realize the links are important to the conversation at hand.</p>

<p>When  less salient  and detailed  material rises to the top I can also tell that it isn&#39;t being seen.</p>

<p>That has been confirmed.</p>

<p>This hasn&#39;t,</p>

<p>Last week I commented on a post  that was about reddit being in cahoots with the CIA </p>

<p>I showed  the  details of that collusion with links  from  </p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/moosearchive/comments/1wflhm/archive/">http://np.reddit.com/r/moosearchive/comments/1wflhm/archive/</a></p>

<p>,those  were seen and voted on but  things have gotten &#39;funny&#39; since then.</p>

<p>Looking for a less  government controlled site.</p>
