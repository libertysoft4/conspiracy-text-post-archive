<p>You are not reactively part of identity politics like Independents once were. You don&#39;t even see the liberal/conservative as relevant to the discussion.</p>

<p>What you see happening right here in <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> is what&#39;s (more slowly) happening around the country. It&#39;s amazing. </p>

<p>You can be an individual interested how politics works without participating in the theatrics. Keep it up!</p>

<p>Edit: I did NOT mean you shouldn&#39;t vote. I simply meant you can participate without being influenced by bullshit and propaganda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh I totally don&#39;t vote, because no matter who wins, the people lose. </p>

<p>Instead I become involved in specific local community interests to make an actual difference. </p>

<p>At this point, the best path forward that I see would be if NOBODY voted. If EVERYONE ignored the politicians and just did their own thing, I think at the very least it would be an interesting social experiment. And when you get right down to it, that&#39;s what a lot of people do anyway; part of that is apathy, which I have difficulty endorsing; I think it&#39;s entirely possible to be an active community minded citizen and have much more impact than a simple vote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought it might be a good idea to stage an event durring the 2016 elections where everyone started nominating leaders based on their P.A.T.S (Participation, Accountability, Trustworthiness and Skillfulness) to form commonwealths in each town. But I need help to get it going, I think its a good idea and would be something to get people to stop thinking about the elections and instead contribute to something that empowers the people. We need to create a vision of how things can be like first with a media campaign of some kind.
Here is the proposal: <a href="http://www.goldenpath.net/alliance-truth/making-world-better/forming-new-commonwealths">http://www.goldenpath.net/alliance-truth/making-world-better/forming-new-commonwealths</a>
Currently working on the website for it:  <a href="http://www.commonwealths.org">www.commonwealths.org</a></p>

<p>If you are interested nominating someone with a P.A.T.S history in the creation of the committee to create the media campaign and help develop a website platform for this idea subscribe to the news letter. The nominee can be vetted by there Reddit history and must have an account that is at least 3 months old with a history of P.A.S.T based on the original posting of this idea (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/250yf1/2016_presidential_elections_what_if_an/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/250yf1/2016_presidential_elections_what_if_an/</a>)</p>

<p>Im completely open to ideas to make this campaign  P.A.T.S. Dont rock the vote, rock the boat :D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In order to keep the whole process free from ego driven desires. Which I talk about in <a href="http://www.goldenpath.net/commonwealths#reform-problem">The Problem</a> part of the proposal it works by making a nomination of someone you feel would be P.A.S.T worthy to operate the campaign. If you are interested in making the world a better place you will understand that I can make any direct connections to anyone as it distorts that process. This may sound over the top, but I feel its necessary for some intuitive reason. You can also wait to see if the site goes live and register for an account and start building P.A.S.T history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am trying to find ways to vett trustworthy people. I would not think it be beneficial to the commonwealths to inadvertently have someone that has ulterior motives being part of the process. We need people that actually want to create commonwealths that empower people instead of dis-empower people. If you have a better idea let me know. This would only be for the initial media campaign and building of the website. Once the commonwealth website got underway, people will be able to register on the commonwealth website and build their own P.A.T.S or P.A.S.T history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The P.A.S.T history will vet those people out, they need to have built a history of being P.A.S.T before they can have any influence on the development of the Commonwealths. In terms of decisions, its similar to a co-operative business. People who try to make proposals that are self-interest related will be discovered by others who are able to monitor each persons actions within the commonwealth since ever action that is significant in moving the Commonwealth forward will need to be submitted to the community for support. At least thats the idea and I need help to look for flaws and make improvements.</p>

Paradoxically, they are worried about Russia and more immediately about Ukrainian rebels, because unbeknownst to the people in the West there is a war going on there against the powers that be.  People don’t know about it because western MSM has been brainwashing them to view Russia as if it was still the &quot;evil&quot; USSR and not a modern multi-party democracy which happens to challenge, by mere existence, the supremacy of the West.  The rebels and political movement in Russia are fighting for the restoration of the sovereignty and liberation from occupiers.  Sounds nuts right?  Russia is a sovereign country, right?  Wrong!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are the powers that be.  Unless you believe in a higher authority, in which case it&#39;s there.  The rest is born out of fear that we will somehow survive all of this - but that&#39;s impossible and irrational because we all die.  Thus, if the man comes to my door to tell me he is in control - I&#39;d have to agree with him.  He is in control.  Hopefully of himself.  However, control over me (or anyone) is impossible without consent.  Thus, if in not consenting we are a threat to his control over himself (and his percieved life) then yes, he is likely worried.  Else, he&#39;s likely not worried.  But it sounds to me like if the man who would say he is in control is not in control of himself out of worry of me then indeed I would beg the question of if he ever truly was in control in the first place.</p>

<p>Depends. If Man used any form of control, then the Man remains in power. </p>

<p>Yes and yes.</p>

<p>That is just silly. You and I both know that Automatons do not think. They think its a good idea because it comes from the Man. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That is a relative question, and would be difficult to answer adequately. It depends who the players involved are. We have people like Charles Manson going to jail for convincing others to commit murder, while US Presidents convince others to go to war. In one situation, the man who ordered is at fault, and in the other, the man who was ordered, killed in war, and was not at fault, simply for following orders.  Simply, it does matter depending on who you are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I read this, TPTB are representative of the banking/media/corporate elite, essentially the plutocracy.  I agree with what you&#39;re saying about perceiving authority and control, ultimately that you&#39;re in control of yourself.  However, the plutocracy doesn&#39;t only want to be in control of themselves, they also want (and ultimately have) control over the spending power of the general populous.  So when they see that our spending may be swayed to a market that is not under their control (ex. local farming, etc.), yes they are worried. They&#39;re worried that their advertising isn&#39;t effective enough to override our own critical thinking, they&#39;re worried that they&#39;re losing ROI.  The basis of their control is the obfuscation of truth, thus when that truth comes out, down falls their house of cards.</p>

There are nuggets of truth everywhere, no <strong>one</strong> set of ideas or beliefs will ever usher in a new enlightenment.

    <div class="md"><p>But that&#39;s inconsiderate.  Stalin didn&#39;t personally kill 20 million Ukrainians.  He had others do it.  A lot of others.  Likewise, if we keep giving credit to individual sociopaths, we neglect the truth that it is impossible for one sociopath to single-handedly kill so many people.  People have to consent to be part of the mass murder.  So indeed, the real question is how do you negotiate with a mob willing to kill so many people needlessly?  Can one man kill the mob of men who agree to listen to orders from another man who has told them to kill?  If no, then that man will have to enlist an entire mob of his own, on orders to kill that other mob who is trying to kill another group.  Invariably, we are not left with individual sociopaths but a collective of sociopaths.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This hit me hard.  We&#39;re giving the Stalins of the world too much credit and absolving ourselves of responsibility.</p>

<p>Every war going on right now is happening because of hundreds of thousands (millions?) of individuals choosing to make it so.  Some joined their military for opportunity, some for money, education, legal requirement; some because they have to, the war was brought to them.  But all relinquish consent for their actions.  They will do as another tells them, without question, because it&#39;s for the good of the unit and in a time of war there are no rules except keeping yourself and your allies alive.</p>

<p>But if all of these people left the military; if every army that has subsequently evolved into the powerful arm of any dictator capable to wield it had said collectively, &quot;Fuck you, we&#39;re not killing anyone&quot;, then war stops.  We&#39;ll stop war once we master ourselves and have the confidence to lead for ourselves.</p>

<p>So, not for a while.</p>

And the crux of this thread is that the propaganda works less and less as people swap capital media for crowd-sourced media.

    <div class="md"><p>Ambition comes from a need to be something or be somewhere where you are not already, its an ego driven desire that causes people&#39;s ideals to become corrupted because they haven&#39;t worked though knowing their subconscious desires. If you know anything about this process people tend to be manipulated by repressed subconscious desires. This is why you will see someone who wants to accomplish something good start out with great intentions and in the end become corrupted though the process of achieving those desires. You can&#39;t really complete worthwhile goals until you have worked out or discovered who you are on a subconscious level first. Once you know thy self, then you can act on anything and there will not be any real ego driven need or want to accomplish it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One problem is that the correlation between authority and merit long ago diverged. If you simply stick the &#39;anti-authoritarian&#39; label on yourself, you might be mistaken for a dirty <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2975578/">&#39;anarchist&#39;</a> that wants to murder and steal whenever you can. There&#39;s nothing wrong with authority per se; if you are the only person that knows and understands the best way to do something, then I&#39;d want you to be an authority on that matter.</p>

<p>But if your position of authority revolves around some piece of knowledge anyone can look up on the internet in a few minutes, then I feel much less obliged to respect that authority than would have someone in the past, and the person in authority has much less leeway to be an asshole without inviting rebuke than in the past. People respect cops when the cops protect and serve, not harass and intimidate. Sometimes cops and detectives solve a big case and catch some real bad guys or cocaine. But in general the only institutional merit cops merit is that they followed orders, and in this way they are similar to their own prisoners. </p>

Fortunately for us, we all still have that moral spark. That little bit of empathy still left inside us.

<p>A database; free, easily searchable, open-source, automated (to whatever extent possible), wiki-like, and crowd-sourced, containing all information for cross-reference <strong>on every single politician and high ranking public official</strong>. This includes; biography (birth, spouses, kins, family relationship), education, published articles/texts, criminal records, wealth (declared familial and speculated), income, meetings, travel-log, personal life in public, for congressmen; voting practices, laws passed, election promises, financing (lobbyists), groups involved (PAC, NGO, NPO), party loyalty, relationship with fellow congressmen, relationship with businesses.</p>

<p>All this information, easily cross-referenced, accessible, free and transparent. It would be a herculean endeavour, but entirely possible. Most of this information is already available, it&#39;s just spread out so thinly that it is virtually impossible to make any consensus out of it (unless of course it is your profession: political PR managers and journalists).</p>

<p>This sinlge source of information, while not &quot;revolutionary&quot; or &quot;failure-proof&quot;, will certainly be less biased than MSM, and possibly reach the same level of importance as Wikipedia (along with the obvious problems regarding deliberate attempts of sabotage, doxxing, PR). This will be a very important step for true Democracy. </p>

<p>Let me nail it down for you. Here&#39;s the new paradigm from what I see from Reddit users. I see people who love memes, naked pictures of girls, armchair activists who decry everything and demanding something be done while eating cheeto&#39;s and smoking a joint and playing Call of duty. I see people who see everything wrong with their government, while never attempting to work in it and trying to fix it. I basically see people who do everything that is right ion their own eyes but see everything wrong with everyone else especially those in power.  Have I nailed down an average Reddit user? </p>

<p>Only 12.3 percent of people voted in this year&#39;s municipal elections. Turnout was even lower in 2013 and 2012, with 11.7 percent and 8.9 percent voting, respectively. On Sunday, Sharpton decried the dismal turnout in an address at a local church. &quot;You all have got to start voting and showing up. Twelve percent turnout is an insult to your children,&quot; he said.

To be human is to be born with moral imperatives that are not learned from experience but which are discovered through introspection. Therefore, everyone must be free to act according to his conscience in order to find the truth buried within.

    <div class="md"><p>To me at least, that&#39;s perfectly 100% compatible with anarcho-capitalism. I know it has the word &#39;capitalism&#39; in the title, but to me at least, it&#39;s so much more and so much different than just &#39;capitalism without a government&#39;. To me, being an an-cap is about exactly what you just said. Treating individuals with respect and love, and letting everyone develop themselves according to who they wish to be, rather than what someone else wants of them. That&#39;s what both human rights and property rights ARE. Rules that allow an individual to be safe from outside interference. Anarcho-capitalism (as I define it) is no more or less than a recognition that statutory law is illegitimate and should be replaced by other methods of bringing aggressors to justice. It is not necessarily materialistic, tho of course if one wished to be materialistic within that system then they are more than welcome to be. But that&#39;s the whole point, individuals are individuals. No system that claims a transcendental approach as you put it could possibly be imposed on anyone without losing what made it transcendental in the first place. Hence, any transcendental approach will necessarily fall under the umbrella of anarcho-capitalism even if it that (admittedly bad) label doesn&#39;t appear to fit it at first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never really understood proposals along these veins. I feel like they miss the point. The problem with political power is not that it is directed incorrectly, or controlled by the wrong people, it&#39;s that it exists. People believe political power is legitimate. As long as you simply try to take over or change political power, you simply reinforce the idea that that power is legitimate. I will admit, that at times, political change CAN have benefits, but these benefits are akin to putting a bandaid on a festering wound. At best it&#39;s only a temporary small improvement, and at worst it backfires by being co-opted by or becoming the very powers it meant to remove. Real, lasting change will only occur when people realize that political power is bunk. It&#39;s a bunch of smoke and mirrors. Only voluntary, consensual action is legitimate. Rallying people to create a new group to hold power is just a continuation of the same failed system.</p>

They want to influence what laws are made or make sure issue A is resolved in such and such a way and issue B resolved in some other way.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah you are latching on to specific words I am using instead of looking at the proposal. It has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with working together to operate in society. There are no power structures in this configuration. Only people who have a P.A.S.T history (Participatory, Accountable, Skillful and Trustworthy) which is tracked by the website. What we are doing with this proposal is using political campaigns to shift the attention from the political structure over to a participatory structure of accountability. Politics get weaker while People in participatory actions get stronger. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The formation of Commonwealths is an idea that I got from this Storm Clouds Gathering Video [8] : He talks about an group six Indian tribes all with their own cultures and traditions called the Iroquois that formed a Federation that lasted well before Columbus and up until 1779 when they were conquered militarily by the U.S. Many historians believe that the the Iroquois Federation was the inspiration for the United States, the difference being the Federation never had a central government. Nobody at the top had any power to force the member tribes to do anything against their will. This system worked and it worked well for a very long time. There is every reason to believe that it can work again in our own country. In order to do that we have to systematically deter people from perusing ego driven desires to create power structures which is just a form of separation. To do that we use incentives like the P.A.S.T conversation history each person develops over the course of his or her commonwealths website membership. Its not a utopian fantasy, its a viable option and its one we should be considering as we move forward with new ideas about how to empower each other. We use the website and peoples P.A.S.T conversation histories support to vet people and proposals to operate the Commonwealths. That way good intentions and corruption like behavior can is easily identified.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The powers that shouldn&#39;t be have every reason to be worried. We all know that they&#39;re as crooked as corkscrews, operating the world&#39;s largest bribery and extortion racket, and bleeding all but the wealthiest Americans to death for their benefit and that of their &quot;campaign donors.&quot;</p>

<p>I was mortified recently to discover the following language in 18 USC 201, the definition of bribery:</p>

<p>(b) Whoever—</p>

<p>(1) directly or indirectly, <strong>corruptly</strong> gives, offers or promises anything of value to any public official or person who has been selected to be a public official, or offers or promises any public official or any person who has been selected to be a public official to give anything of value to any other person or entity, with intent—</p>

<p>(A) to influence any official act; or</p>

<p>(B) to influence such public official or person who has been selected to be a public official to commit or aid in committing, or collude in, or allow, any fraud, or make opportunity for the commission of any fraud, on the United States; or</p>

<p>(C) to induce such public official or such person who has been selected to be a public official to do or omit to do any act in violation of the lawful duty of such official or person;</p>

<p>&quot;Corruptly&quot; is ubiquitous in the state definitions of bribery and this notion that bribes must be offered and received &quot;corruptly&quot; in order to be unlawful pervades the statutes. Many people would consider the offer and acceptance of something of value in exchange for official action to constitute a bribe, but as it turns out, politicians must be bribed &quot;corruptly&quot; in order to have done something wrong... Puhleeeeze...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a two party system, those who want to corrupt the system only need to corrupt the major presidential candidates on both sides of the two party divide. Then, no matter who wins the election, the corruption succeeds. This also works for any congressional office. It doesn&#39;t take advanced mathematics to calculate the number of politicians such tactics would need to corrupt to thwart the will of the people. The number is relatively small.</p>

<p>So, in such a system, which is our real world, what can the people of the US do to have any hope of combating such corruption?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with all of your points.  People are definitely becoming more &quot;truth-seeking&quot; but unfortunately there&#39;s a lot of BS info floating around coming from people who claim to be intelligent, but aren&#39;t, or are just making bogus facts up.</p>

<p>If you really wanna know and realize what&#39;s going on in the world, you cannot automatically discount any source, and you can&#39;t automatically credit any source that you&#39;ve trusted in the past.</p>

<p>So many times I&#39;ve seen some of my friends, who question everything, get completely misled by just uneducated information just because it aligns with their views.  I don&#39;t know everything, but I do know a lot about a few things, and when I see conspiracies posted so matter-of-factly that I know for a fact contradict the truth, it&#39;s hard to explain the real purpose to them.  They&#39;ve essentially become close-minded to things that contradict their view or take on a particular story, which is exactly what they started rebelling against in the first place!</p>

<p>If you read something on a website, no matter if its MSM or any of these so-called &quot;activist&quot; or &quot;free-thinking&quot; websites, do your own research, because a lot of times those sites exist just to come up with outlandish things to get you to share on this subreddit and Facebook.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be complacent with info you read, and don&#39;t become the sheep that you accuse MSM digesters of being.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Liberal in American politics, and is one facet that demonstrates how both Democrat and Republican policies favor ultra-authoritarianism in their own ways.  Democrats want to set mandatory social norms for conservatives to ensure that their worldview is the only one supported by law, and also push for programs that support and reinforce utter reliance on the government for survival.  Republican policy, on the other hand, thanks to its corruption by the religious right, wants to establish antiquated and draconian social norms based upon the rules established and reinforced by their faith.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s not to condemn all mainstream policy initiatives of either party, both of which are sides of the same coin and are striving for total control over the populace.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an objective truth that the laws, like the Civil Rights Acts of 64 and 68 were enacted by the Democrats.  It&#39;s also objectively true that the effect of those laws is to force people to behave a certain way.  I didn&#39;t express any of the crap contained in your post.  Frankly, I think it&#39;s sick that we need laws to force people to treat everyone else equally.  History has shown, though, that we do, and the Democratic party spearheaded by LBJ put some of those laws into place, imposing their worldview on other individuals through coercive governance.  I&#39;m not saying that it shouldn&#39;t have happened.  I&#39;m simply saying that it did happen.</p>

<p>The latter half of your well-reasoned and articulate response demonstrates exactly what&#39;s wrong with the Democratic party in particular.  Many people who vote Democrat consider themselves &quot;liberal,&quot; when their actual worldview is historically conservative.  Most policies pushed through today by Democrats and railed against by Republicans would not have appeared out of place in Reagan&#39;s policies and would probably have been lauded by Republicans if they had been proposed by one of their own.  Liberals trading under the name Democrat, by and large, simply want to maintain the status quo with a little tweak here or there.  They do not want true social change and upheaval that typically marks periods of extremely liberal political climes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a major difference between expressing your opinions and forcing a worldview on a society.  If you disagree that using the government to enact and enforce laws that require a human being to act in a manner such that they can be placed in financial ruin for failing to comply, which the 64 and 68 acts did, constitutes use of government to control behavior, I&#39;m curious to know what you would consider it.</p>

<p>Be mindful of a few things, though.  First, I think that discrimination on almost any grounds, including because someone is a member of a protected class or because someone has some attribute that is no statutorily protected is awful.  It pains me that we even have to have some kind of laws on the books to enforce behavior that should be the norm.  Sadly, history and current events prove that we do need those laws.</p>

<p>Second, I&#39;m a civil rights attorney, who spends 75% of his professional life litigating claims across the country under the ADA, the ADEA, the FHA, and other facets of Titles VII-X, along with their state law analogues.  Actively working in, presenting on, and writing on these issues has provided me with the insight into how poorly implemented those laws are, and how readily and often the civil remedies portions of those statutes are misused and abused.  A big part of those failures come from poor drafting that allows for vilification of people who do not have ill intent, but who slip and say or do something that violates the law.  Another big part of those failures stems from a lack of ability for the wrongfully accused to fight back and hold the false accused accountable and liable for their actions.  Do I have a solution?  No, I wish that I did, but outside of rewriting every part of those acts to conform to Title VII&#39;s newer language, we&#39;ll continue to see innocent, well meaning people have their lives thrown into chaos through overly liberal enforcement of those well intentioned laws.</p>

<p>Before you take a leap and think I&#39;m talking about someone like the moron in Ohio who had a No Blacks sign on her swimming pool because she thought she could do what she wanted on her privately owned, but rented, property, I&#39;m not.  I&#39;m talking about innocuous cases I see every day.  Like the one case where a guy brand new to leasing a property of his mentioned in an ad that the third floor apartment opened onto a steep, steel, unenclosed staircase, so tenants with very young children may want to take that into consideration.  Did he intend to discriminate against someone based on familial status?  Of course not.  He believed that he was helping to protect a child from potentially getting hurt by advising potential tenants of a dangerous condition.  The result?  Potential tenant files a complaint with HUD and the renter is forced to pay me money to defend him and to pay thousands of dollars to the claimant to avoid dealing with a federal lawsuit where his fees alone would have eclipsed $100,000, and where he would have lost because his intent isn&#39;t even a consideration.</p>

<p>Or maybe I&#39;m talking about the apartment manager who has a tenant who is a member of a protected class who stops paying rent.  The apartment manager gives notice of eviction proceedings and all of a sudden it&#39;s a Section 3604 claim followed by a Section 3617 claim.  The apartment manager ultimately wins, of course, but not until spending tens of thousands of dollars in unrecoupable attorneys fees to draft and argue motions to dismiss, to conduct discovery, and to draft and argue a winning summary judgment motion, only to have spend another twenty or thirty grand fighting the appeal.  For a large management company or REIT, that&#39;s no big deal.  For someone who owns a small multiunit rental property, it can put them out of business.  And why?  Because the government, particularly the Democrat party, has put in place a poorly drafted statute designed to change the way people act and think, and because interpretive case law has allowed BS claims to proceed as often as valid claims and has not provided the supposed &quot;oppressors&quot; with a real remedy to fight back against spurious claims.</p>

<p>Or maybe I&#39;m talking about a woman who did not have the skills of accumen to advance in her position, or who possessed character flaws that were undesirable for the workplace, let alone for advancement, or who participated in bawdy language with her co-workers, male and female alike, and then sued when she wasn&#39;t promoted.  </p>

<p>Lawsuits like the ones I described above are an unfortunate, but real, consequence of the laws that were enacted, really, to make sure that everyone got a fair shake, regardless of their race, sex, national origin, age, religion or disability.  The principle behind the laws are admirable, but the social impact caused by forcing people to engage in any kind of activity inevitably leads to a large number of those protected class members assuming a victim mentality and abusing those laws for purposes other than what they were originally intended to do.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not passing negative judgment on the enactment of these statutes.  I&#39;m all for equal treatment and completely opposed to unreasonable discrimination.  We have enough ignorant, discriminatory jerks in our population who make them necessary.  However, I can and do acknowledge that those statutes constitute government enactment and enforcement of social norms that run contra to some people&#39;s cultural beliefs, wrong or right, and have created a system that causes it&#39;s own set of unfortunate problems that impact our society by reinforcing an &quot;us against them&quot; mentality, and negatively impact our economy on both a macro and micro level.</p>

<p>What is my world view ? Where have I expressed except for an accuracy of language ? Words have meaning, lets try to use them correctly. The desire to overturn authoritarian regimes is a core feature of liberalism. Even conservatives would agree with this. Who really wants authoritarianism. Who really knowingly embraces lies ? What a joke of an argument.</p>

<p>To be clear. You are arguing that any law passed is oppressive. Litter laws which prohibit me from turning my community into a third world beach are &quot;ultra authoritarian&quot; because it &quot;forces me&quot; to do something. What a joke. Your lack of discernment and black / white mentality is a handicap.</p>

<p>Agreed. However if you have a vested interest in a frame, you have motivation to lie and twist to meet that vested interest. Such as you have demonstrated above. But dont let me stop you from pouding your authoritarian chest in self righteous &quot;I know Better cus im a lawyer&quot; glory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do find it amusing.  I&#39;m always curious to see how people with such reactive, violent, thoughtless, unresearched, and condescending replies to my posts respond to thoughtful, well reasoned, borderline respectful (I&#39;m a litigator.  I write and debate for a living.  Small jabs inevitably slip through my internal filter.) responses to their mean spirited posts. I guess that I hope that one day I&#39;ll see evidence that is taught someone something and they appreciate it, even if they don&#39;t agree with it, and I have that hope because I have been taught a lot by other users who know a lot more about things than I do, and is always appreciated the insight.</p>

<p>Shit, just today, I had someone teach me a great deal about Icelandic politics and current events, and provide me with a ton of cool information, including their thoughts on the state of Icelandic society, and had someone else teach me how to read and pronounce all of those crazy protogermanic letters in the Icelandic.  How did it start?  Because I made an ignorant (not disrespectful, but uneducated) comment about Iceland.  Within an hour a bunch of cool people from Iceland brought me some knowledge.  I&#39;ve corrected my understanding, learned something new, met a couple of cool folks, and loved every minute of it.  I guess I&#39;d like to know that I had that influence once here, but a board full of users with strong, strong biases and opinions may not be it.  I had some hope with this one, though, because he or she came across as someone who was simply unlearned and that was defensive because he or she is a member of a protected class that some people find to be overly privileged. (Rightly or wrongly).  Time will tell, but my confidence is diminishing. </p>

Scratch a conservative and you find someone who prefers the past over any future. Scratch a liberal and find a closet aristocrat. It&#39;s true! Liberal governments always develop into aristocracies. The bureaucracies betray the true intent of people who form such governments. Right from the first the little people who formed the governments which promised to equalize the social burdens found themselves suddenly in the hands of bureaucratic aristocracies. Of course, all bureaucracies follow this pattern, but what a hypocrisy to find this even under a communized banner. Ahhh, well, if patterns teach me anything it&#39;s that patterns are repeated. My oppressions, by and large, are no worse than any of the others and, at least, I teach a new lesson.

<p>See: the consistent liberal progressive attack on the human/natural/human right of self defense (via 2A and other related human rights and self defense law).</p>

<p>Another good example of the liberal progressive inconsistency in supporting human rights (and true agendas, often based on misinformation) is the liberal progressive outrage narrative against lack of reciprocity in same sex marriages in different states, all the while supporting lack of reciprocity in recognizing the human right of self defense in different states (via opposition against reciprocity in firearms carry permits).</p>

<p>I support human/natural/constitutional rights for all American citizens. If people of the same sex want to get married, great. If people want to exercise their human right of self defense and arm themselves with a firearm, great. However, oddly enough that second right I just listed puts me at odds with the liberal progressive political beliefs and agendas.</p>

Many people who vote Democrat consider themselves &quot;liberal,&quot; when their actual worldview is historically conservative.  Most policies pushed through today by Democrats and railed against by Republicans would not have appeared out of place in Reagan&#39;s policies and would probably have been lauded by Republicans if they had been proposed by one of their own.  Liberals trading under the name Democrat, by and large, simply want to maintain the status quo with a little tweak here or there.  They do not want true social change and upheaval that typically marks periods of extremely liberal political climes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a major difference between expressing your opinions and forcing a worldview on a society.  If you disagree that using the government to enact and enforce laws that require a human being to act in a manner such that they can be placed in financial ruin for failing to comply, which the 64 and 68 acts did, constitutes use of government to control behavior, I&#39;m curious to know what you would consider it.</p>

<p>Be mindful of a few things, though.  First, I think that discrimination on almost any grounds, including because someone is a member of a protected class or because someone has some attribute that is no statutorily protected is awful.  It pains me that we even have to have some kind of laws on the books to enforce behavior that should be the norm.  Sadly, history and current events prove that we do need those laws.</p>

<p>Second, I&#39;m a civil rights attorney, who spends 75% of his professional life litigating claims across the country under the ADA, the ADEA, the FHA, and other facets of Titles VII-X, along with their state law analogues.  Actively working in, presenting on, and writing on these issues has provided me with the insight into how poorly implemented those laws are, and how readily and often the civil remedies portions of those statutes are misused and abused.  A big part of those failures come from poor drafting that allows for vilification of people who do not have ill intent, but who slip and say or do something that violates the law.  Another big part of those failures stems from a lack of ability for the wrongfully accused to fight back and hold the false accused accountable and liable for their actions.  Do I have a solution?  No, I wish that I did, but outside of rewriting every part of those acts to conform to Title VII&#39;s newer language, we&#39;ll continue to see innocent, well meaning people have their lives thrown into chaos through overly liberal enforcement of those well intentioned laws.</p>

<p>Before you take a leap and think I&#39;m talking about someone like the moron in Ohio who had a No Blacks sign on her swimming pool because she thought she could do what she wanted on her privately owned, but rented, property, I&#39;m not.  I&#39;m talking about innocuous cases I see every day.  Like the one case where a guy brand new to leasing a property of his mentioned in an ad that the third floor apartment opened onto a steep, steel, unenclosed staircase, so tenants with very young children may want to take that into consideration.  Did he intend to discriminate against someone based on familial status?  Of course not.  He believed that he was helping to protect a child from potentially getting hurt by advising potential tenants of a dangerous condition.  The result?  Potential tenant files a complaint with HUD and the renter is forced to pay me money to defend him and to pay thousands of dollars to the claimant to avoid dealing with a federal lawsuit where his fees alone would have eclipsed $100,000, and where he would have lost because his intent isn&#39;t even a consideration.</p>

<p>Or maybe I&#39;m talking about the apartment manager who has a tenant who is a member of a protected class who stops paying rent.  The apartment manager gives notice of eviction proceedings and all of a sudden it&#39;s a Section 3604 claim followed by a Section 3617 claim.  The apartment manager ultimately wins, of course, but not until spending tens of thousands of dollars in unrecoupable attorneys fees to draft and argue motions to dismiss, to conduct discovery, and to draft and argue a winning summary judgment motion, only to have spend another twenty or thirty grand fighting the appeal.  For a large management company or REIT, that&#39;s no big deal.  For someone who owns a small multiunit rental property, it can put them out of business.  And why?  Because the government, particularly the Democrat party, has put in place a poorly drafted statute designed to change the way people act and think, and because interpretive case law has allowed BS claims to proceed as often as valid claims and has not provided the supposed &quot;oppressors&quot; with a real remedy to fight back against spurious claims.</p>

<p>Or maybe I&#39;m talking about a woman who did not have the skills of accumen to advance in her position, or who possessed character flaws that were undesirable for the workplace, let alone for advancement, or who participated in bawdy language with her co-workers, male and female alike, and then sued when she wasn&#39;t promoted.  </p>

<p>Lawsuits like the ones I described above are an unfortunate, but real, consequence of the laws that were enacted, really, to make sure that everyone got a fair shake, regardless of their race, sex, national origin, age, religion or disability.  The principle behind the laws are admirable, but the social impact caused by forcing people to engage in any kind of activity inevitably leads to a large number of those protected class members assuming a victim mentality and abusing those laws for purposes other than what they were originally intended to do.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not passing negative judgment on the enactment of these statutes.  I&#39;m all for equal treatment and completely opposed to unreasonable discrimination.  We have enough ignorant, discriminatory jerks in our population who make them necessary.  However, I can and do acknowledge that those statutes constitute government enactment and enforcement of social norms that run contra to some people&#39;s cultural beliefs, wrong or right, and have created a system that causes it&#39;s own set of unfortunate problems that impact our society by reinforcing an &quot;us against them&quot; mentality, and negatively impact our economy on both a macro and micro level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do find it amusing.  I&#39;m always curious to see how people with such reactive, violent, thoughtless, unresearched, and condescending replies to my posts respond to thoughtful, well reasoned, borderline respectful (I&#39;m a litigator.  I write and debate for a living.  Small jabs inevitably slip through my internal filter.) responses to their mean spirited posts. I guess that I hope that one day I&#39;ll see evidence that is taught someone something and they appreciate it, even if they don&#39;t agree with it, and I have that hope because I have been taught a lot by other users who know a lot more about things than I do, and is always appreciated the insight.</p>

<p>Shit, just today, I had someone teach me a great deal about Icelandic politics and current events, and provide me with a ton of cool information, including their thoughts on the state of Icelandic society, and had someone else teach me how to read and pronounce all of those crazy protogermanic letters in the Icelandic.  How did it start?  Because I made an ignorant (not disrespectful, but uneducated) comment about Iceland.  Within an hour a bunch of cool people from Iceland brought me some knowledge.  I&#39;ve corrected my understanding, learned something new, met a couple of cool folks, and loved every minute of it.  I guess I&#39;d like to know that I had that influence once here, but a board full of users with strong, strong biases and opinions may not be it.  I had some hope with this one, though, because he or she came across as someone who was simply unlearned and that was defensive because he or she is a member of a protected class that some people find to be overly privileged. (Rightly or wrongly).  Time will tell, but my confidence is diminishing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  We should not &quot;ignore&quot; politicians.  They have the power to make deisions that affect all of us.  Sure, you may have a grater impact on a local level, but we need to hold all law makers and politicians accountable.</p>
