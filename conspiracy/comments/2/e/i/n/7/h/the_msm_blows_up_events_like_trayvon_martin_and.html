        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you control the media then you can manipulate the content enough to push people in the directions you choose. </p>

<p>How do you stop a group of people from realizing that they are all in it together and the real battle should be against those in charge?</p>

<p>Easy, you set them against one another. Politics used to be effective enough to do this but now that system is starting to lose its hold. People are identifying less with Democratic vs. Republican, Liberal, Conservative, etc...</p>

<p>So you set them at each other&#39;s throats over the next biggest thing: race. </p>

<p>This is why a huge story never &quot;breaks&quot; about minority police officers killing a white person under suspicious circumstances. Because believe me, that happens all the time.</p>

<p>The story never goes viral because they are not trying to poke the &quot;white&quot; hornets nest, they are trying to poke the &quot;black&quot; one. It makes more sense strategically on every level.</p>

She brought a friend of hers to the award show and let him accept her award and he went on to talk about how he was one of the 1.6 million young homeless Americans. We need celebrities to do more services like this to the public and use their notoriety to spread awareness about issues like homelessness instead of just being dumb and lame distractions for real serious issues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and when you apply it to the geopolitical sphere the result is that you&#39;re creating conflict (by definition a thesis and antithesis) and then you&#39;re backing both sides in order to <em>synthesize</em> the two alternate concepts into a <strong>synthesis</strong> (outcome) of your choice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. <strong>Class struggle.</strong> Marxist texts lay out the groundwork masterfully. The enemy is the bourgeoisie. </p>

<p>Marxist analysis of classes: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Labor (the proletariat or workers) includes anyone who earns their livelihood by selling their labor power and being paid a wage or salary for their labor time. They have little choice but to work for capital, since they typically have no independent way to survive.</p></li>
<li><p>Capital (the bourgeoisie or capitalists) includes anyone who gets their income not from labor as much as from the surplus value they appropriate from the workers who create wealth. The income of the capitalists, therefore, is based on their exploitation of the workers (proletariat). </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really not rich vs poor, you&#39;re being led down another garden path. Did all the millionaires get together and decide to engineer 9/11, and the War on Terror? To keep themselves rich and keep the poor poor? Only very few benefit from the current state of affairs. The vast majority of the rich in this country are being duped right along with the rest of us. </p>

<p>Did the upper class engineer a financial and taxation system that ensures that their money and property is not truly their own, only on loan from much more powerful entities that can seize or diminish their wealth at will? No, they just have the polished end of the shit stick. Yes, they have more say than the poor, more &quot;freedom&quot;, but they don&#39;t fight the system for the same reason the poor don&#39;t rise up, they&#39;ve been fooled too, and they don&#39;t want to risk giving up what they have.</p>

<p>We&#39;re talking about a much smaller group of people and organizations in this country for whom the word &quot;rich&quot; is woefully inadequate. The enemy remains the banking empires, the false flag raisers, the social engineers, the war architects.. Not some dope worth 5 million who watches Fox News and votes Republican.</p>

<p>If anything it&#39;s the ultra-rich-and-powerful vs. everyone else. It&#39;s the 9/11 masterminds and the corrupt politicians who cover for them. A group so small, relatively, that it can&#39;t really be called class warfare, it&#39;s a war on humanity waged by monsters who manipulate even the wealthy to act against their best interests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that assumption isn&#39;t at all necessary.  The media doesn&#39;t need to be completely free from government intervention to also be driven by profit.  The world is not black and white.</p>

<p>The simplest explanation is usually the correct one.  For your conspiracy to work, it would mean a lot of people working together, many against their publicly stated (and some deeply held) ideals, keeping completely secret this vast conspiracy to manipulate the news from top to bottom in order to divide the country in order to control it.</p>

<p>My solution requires a company driven by profit finding the way to make the most profit.</p>

<p>Not that one is impossible and the other is not, but not knowing what is going on, the one that makes more sense is the one that is far more likely.</p>

<p>Some media corporations like Disney focus on entertainment, so their interests probably don&#39;t conflict with News-Corp.  They also develop news brands that target a demographic niche, FOX news targeting conservatives for example.  Niches = less competition.</p>

<p>They should make money.  But if the money keeps flowing in, would they really want to rock the boat?  I think an oligopoly/monopoly would prefer the status-quo.  </p>

<p>So what you are saying is that NewsCorp doesn&#39;t want as large a market share as possible?  You are saying that they are <em>not</em> in competition with TBS for viewers?  Don&#39;t be naive.

<p>The fact that they have been constantly sucking up all of these smaller media entities suggests that their desire to &quot;not rock the boat&quot; pretty much doesn&#39;t exist.  If they are happy with the way things are, why do they keep trying to expand themselves?  Clearly they are not happy with their current profits.</p>

<p>TBS isn&#39;t exactly known for news, and we are talking about news, right?  Maybe you mean that the news has to compete with other entertainment, not just news.  In that sense you are right that&#39;s why they have news programs late at night after prime-time.  Also, there are news junkies, and there are people who don&#39;t watch the news.  I don&#39;t think CNN will be competing against Nickelodeon for viewership.       </p>

<p>I think mergers are different than snatching up other companies since it benefits both companies equally like Comcast and Time Warner for example.

<p>I agree, and my point is that on the top levels, very subtle shifts are enough to create and manipulate thought-patterns on the bottom level.</p>

<p>Like another user wrote, when a song is popular, a large part of that is the music industry big-wigs cutting checks to the radio stations to play that song over and over again <strong>to <em>make</em> it popular.</strong></p>

<p>In other words, maybe if we chose a random unknown musician on youtube and gave their song the same kind of radio-play, people would equally say &quot;Wow, that is such a great song!&quot;</p>

<p>Where is the line drawn? Where does the virtue of the song itself end and promotion begin? </p>

<p>Like you said, the world is not black and white. And I personally believe that most world powers know this and do a lot of their dirty work <strong>intentionally</strong> in the gray areas. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying that it isn&#39;t possible to manipulate people, only that the simple and more logical explanation in this case is profit, not mass government interference and control of the media in order to divide people.

<p>It&#39;s not that your explanation <em>can&#39;t</em> be true, only that it is unlikely. . .and when we have a much more likely and reasonable one that doesn&#39;t require vast coverups and keeping people silent against their ideals, then it doesn&#39;t seem reasonable to choose the complicated, difficult explanation over the simple, easy explanation.</p>

<p>I would hardly saying viewing them as purely profit driven, rather than unbiased information driven, is giving them &quot;the benefit of the doubt.&quot;</p>

<p>The real difference is that I see a simple, obvious explanation and you are coming up with a difficult to achieve and complicated explanation and you are choosing to believe the more ridiculous one.

<p>I am saying they are playing the &quot;nonsense&quot; because it is what we are most likely to watch thus it is the most profitable for them.  The missing Malaysian flight does not divide us, but it certainly drew a lot of attention.  Among the most of any recent news event.</p>

<p>You&#39;re damn right they don&#39;t.  Edward Snowden?  Censorship?  If the powerful are also the owners of the media empire and they rub elbows with other powerful people as well as the government, would they allow that news to be broadcasted? </p>

<p>We both agree that there is a profit motive, and there is no doubt about that.  So where else do you think the media would profit the most?  </p>

<p>Being in cahoots with the government is like winning the lottery.  One of your branches is in the red?  No problem!  Just ask for some handouts from the government like a few banks did a few years ago.  But in return, they&#39;ll just ask not to air certain topics since it will affect the government&#39;s own bottom line.  </p>

<p>One topic that pads the government&#39;s bottom-line are wars.  Wars are the biggest racket in history and you can be sure as hell that there are people getting rich off it.  As you probably already know, the U.S. burns about <a href="http://fcnl.org/issues/afghanistan/Cost_of_the_Afghanistan_War_By_the_Numbers_13_FEB13.pdf">a billion dollars</a> a week in Afghanistan.  During the Vietnam war, the media prematurely killed the government&#39;s business venture by simply showing the American people the truth.  I&#39;m sure the government learned from their mistake and would rather have the media working with them, quid pro quo of course.  So you can see that it pays to be in the government&#39;s pocket.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point hasn&#39;t drifted at all.  I&#39;ve had to keep pulling you back.</p>

<p>To explain, again, the argument is that the government is using things, like the ferguson riots, through the media to divide us so we are more easily controlled.  My point is that the more simple, obvious, <em>and likely</em> explanation is that the media is mainly driven by profit, not government interference.</p>

<p>The example that suggests this is the amount of coverage the Malaysian flight disappearance got.  This does not divide us at all, yet it was relentlessly covered.  What this has in common with the Ferguson riots is that it evokes a very visceral response in people; these are things that play on our internal and instinctual fears at a very basic level.</p>

<p>Government corruption just does not hit on the same level.  For some people, sure, but for the masses?  Definitely not.</p>

<p>The evidence suggests that the more obvious and simply solution is the answer.  Believing the more complicated and convoluted version of it, without proof, seems silly to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for getting to the point.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t take a position on whether or not the media intentionally focuses on the Ferguson riots as part of a plot to divide us, and our conversation was on government influence on the media. </p>

<p>But my position ATM is that I agree with you on the Ferguson riots.  I would also like to add that the coverage might actually help improve racial relations by raising awareness. </p>

<p>&quot;Government corruption just does not hit on the same level. For some people, sure, but for the masses? Definitely not.&quot;</p>

<p>But here I disagree.  Cover it enough times and in the right way and people will listen.  It happens all the time in foreign countries and their rulers end up getting deposed.  </p>

<p>Get the fuck over yourself.  If you want a respectful debate, don&#39;t come out of the gate with calling &quot;bullshit&quot; and then talking down to someone by saying their position is nothing more than &quot;nuh-uh.&quot;  When you act like a douche, expect it to come back to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, because alleging that Jews control the media and are brainwashing us, sowing discord between blacks and whites to keep us from teaming up on the real enemy, and that this explains why the unrest in Ferguson has been in the news, is classic antisemitism. I&#39;ll quote Henry Ford&#39;s <em>The International Jew: Aspects of Jewish power in the United States:</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the South a terrible lynching period came and divided the country into pro-lynching and pro-Negro parties, but still no one saw the reason for it all. The race question rose to threatening proportions, the Americans of the North and South looked at each other askance, there was a cooling of sympathy between the regions. Northerners were inclined to look at Southerners as unjust and inhuman in their treatment of the Negro, and Southerners were inclined to look upon Northerners as temperamentally unsympathetic and stupidly ignorant of what the conditions were.</p>

<p>Behind it all were the products of men like Lee Levy and Dreyfuss, Weil &amp; Company, to use only the names quoted from Collier&#39;s.</p>

<p>The ancient Jewish policy of Divide-Conquer-Destroy was in operation. Jewish policy favors disunion as a preparation to the kind of union which Jewish leaders want. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=V_svAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;lpg=PA28&amp;amp;ots=rtQxcMrcmP&amp;amp;dq=Behind%20it%20all%20were%20the%20products%20of%20men%20like%20Lee%20Levy%20and%20Dreyfuss%2C%20Weil%20%26%20Company%2C%20to%20use%20only%20the%20names%20quoted%20from%20Collier&#x27;s.&amp;amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false">-p. 28</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ford also <a href="http://www.jrbooksonline.com/Intl_Jew_full_version/ij17.htm">quotes the Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a> on Jewish control over the media:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Says the Second Protocol:</p>

<p>“There is one great force in the hands of modern governments which creates thought movements among the people, that is, the Press. The presumed role of the Press is to indicate supposedly indispensable needs, to register popular complaints, and to create discontent. The triumph of ‘free speech’ (babbling) rests in the Press. But governments are unable to profit by this power, and it has fallen into our hands. Through it we have attained influence while remaining in the shadow. Thanks to it, we have amassed gold, though it has cost us torrents of blood and tears.”</p>

<p>Again, in the Seventh Protocol, discussing the progress which the World Program has already made, the part played by the Press is indicated:</p>

<p>“We must force the Gentile governments to adopt measures which will promote our broadly conceived plan already approaching its triumphal goal, by bringing to bear the pressure of stimulated public opinion, which has in reality been organized by us with the help of the so-called ‘great power’ of the Press. With few exceptions not worth considering, it is already in our hands.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are the ideas your friend is alluding to. They are antisemitic through and through. </p>

<p>And where did I mention Israel? It was founded on illegitimate principles and throughout its history has pursued a series of racist and inhumane policies. There will be no peace in the Middle East until Israel comes to the table with genuine willingness to negotiate with whatever Palestinian leadership exists, and there will not be justice in Israel-Palestine until all Palestinians are granted full citizenship in the land of their birth or of their parents and grandparents. Anti-Zionists are not all antisemitic but all antisemites are anti-Zionists. Your friend was not talking about Zionism. They were talking about a Jewish cabal. </p>

<p>I hope this makes sense. I&#39;m a bit stoned.</p>

<p>there is no &quot;alleging&quot; required, it is plain to see both in the names or background of the owners or controllers and in the subtle and sometimes not so subtle agenda pushed by nearly every show and film that emerges from there.</p>

<p>the vast majority of zionists claim to be &quot;jews&quot; but are actually khazar. when we have 3 or 4 flavors of &quot;jews&quot; in the world its quite understandable us goyim may make a generalization here and there. highlighting facts relating to jewish domination of media and other areas of life is no more racist than pointing out nba is dominated by blacks or pizzaria&#39;s tend to be italian. facts are not racist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. It&#39;s simple divide and conquer tactics.</p>

<p>Race happens to be an old standby angle for the master class and their state media guard dogs, and now frankly, quite a tired one at that.</p>

<p>They channel the narratives into race to compartmentalize dissent. If American citizens realized how they have the same common interests against the master class, they would be united and strong. Channeling narratives to only allow race discussion keeps the citizenry divided along the terms of the masters.</p>

You cant tell me that when most private prisons are filled with people of color. Yeah the left has that evil whitey narrative to make it seem like the right side is right about it being pc</p>

<p>Not saying all white ppl are bad but the majority of te elite are white who still run things and minorities have been fucked the most.  I just think the truth ppl out there still down play the hidden racism on the elite level. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ding, ding, ding. The OP gets it. In the Trayvon Martin case, the US media seriously downplayed key aspects of the case to make it sensational. They published deliberately outdated photos and virtually ignored the fact that there was a physical altercation, in order to make Martin seem entirely innocent. </p>

<p>Due to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, US media ownership has been consolidated to a few groups of wealthy individuals. It us entirely naive to think that US journalism isn&#39;t routinely manipulated to promote the agenda of the elite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reminds me of a chapter in &quot;Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina&quot;. The 2 storm troopers in A New Hope had been at a moisture farm earlier taking a report from a farmer after he had been attacked by sand people. In sci-fi we get literal racial differences. The troopers and farmers are the same race (human) but different from the other. The &quot;salt of the earth&quot; farmers are being attacked by a different race and call the &quot;cops&quot;. The &quot;cops&quot; dont do much in this story because it suits them to have the farmers dependent on them for protection. A relationship of protector and yet master forms between farmer and trooper. The sand people on the other hand can be killed with impunity or left to die of thirst in their poverty. It seems to me that this story is not just one author&#39;s imagination but a eerie prediction.<br/>
Blacks (or arabs) are the sand people and left in poverty. While a disarmed white populace is made to feel secure with white cops. They want the white majority to work and support the cops keeping the non whites down. So poking the black hornet&#39;s nest makes sense. It keeps a stereotype going. What better way to control a population than through fear?</p>

<p>seems this shill specializes in masquerading as an African American online, or attempts to, they have multiple account onlive.com for various black cities in the US, he/she &#39;follows&#39;  five other names on that system, also popping up on google is this shills dating.com page (under the same name as the shill !?) , ho hum white as white can be.</p>

<p>from this shills zip code, its NW USA, a cetain city, thye seem to work for a govt dept agency there, confirmed sort of by some of their comments in a Youtube vidoe on a subject that concerns their employment.</p>

<p>this shill also has a major hardon in hating Ron Paul at any and every occasion, theres also seems to be a DNC connection to their locality, which would explain the Ron Paul hatred...</p>

<p>this govt employee for the last six or so years since they left college and became a govt employee working as an administrative type job in a govt agency (science based). has been trolling and shill in public forums doing very specific duties.</p>

<p>it would answer the age old question, what do govt employees do with 75% of their time at work. 25% at the job they get paid for, 75% other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think alot of it is MSM rushing to put out stories without waiting for all of the facts to come in.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s the world we live in today... we need shit instantly.  If you don&#39;t have the story instantly, somebody else probably does.</p>

<p>And in doing this, it leaves alot of room for people to jump to conclusions.  If they released all the stuff of the Mike Brown shooting the first day, probably wouldn&#39;t have any protesters.</p>

<p>People would be like.. damn, that nigga possibly robbed a CS, then broke that cops orbital and then got shot.  All those facts together, most people would not have much to be up in arms about.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t fit the Trayvon case into the same parameters though.  Since GZ put himself into a position he should not have been in.  He was not a  police officer like the guy who shot mike brown.  GZ was just a dumb asshole who was tired of police not showing up and taking his calls seriously, so instead of waiting on them to arrive he decided he was going to keep looking for the &quot; perp &quot; who he&#39;d confused w\ another black kid he&#39;d seen in the area before. </p>

<p>With the trayvon case the rush to judgement was not putting zimmerman&#39;s racial makeup out day one.  When he was arrested, for all intents and purposes he was white.  White name, looks white.. why would you think him not to be white?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;m doing is stating a simple fact, which is that when a story breaks it gets reported.</p>

<p>With michael brown the story broke and it was that of an unarmed black teen getting shot multiple times for at the time unknown reasons.</p>

<p>In pre internet times this would have turned out differently because by the time they were able to report the story, they&#39;d have figured out the cop had a broken orbital and that the guy had possibly just robbed a convenience store.</p>

<p>And then w\ Zimmerman being reported as being white... Looks white... white name... what else do you need?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, like I initially thought you&#39;re extremely confused.</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing you have no proof of anything you&#39;re saying.  Whereas what I&#39;m saying is something that people of sound mind could logically discuss.</p>

<p>IF you were reporting on the zimmerman story and this guy&#39;s name is Zimmerman, and he looks white, you&#39;re obviously going to think he&#39;s white.</p>

<p>Which w\ the Trayvon case was a moot point  Race only came in to play for the fact that zimmerman racially profiled Trayvon, and initiated a confrontation that ended w\ him murdering him.</p>

<p>The Mike Brown case is no different.  They didn&#39;t have the convenience store footage on day one.  They didn&#39;t have the officer&#39;s xray images on day one.  They just had a story about a guy w\ his hands up getting shot multiple times and people rush to judgment.</p>

<p>Theres no conspiracy here... only people reporting a news story without complete set of facts.  You don&#39;t simply report a breaking news story 2 weeks after it happens when all the facts are out... because by that time all your competitors have had the story.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>This is why a huge story never &quot;breaks&quot; about minority police officers killing a white person under suspicious circumstances. Because believe me, that happens all the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead of just writing this shit, how about you show us some proof? Because &quot;believe me&quot; is usually just internet slang for &quot;I made this shit up&quot;.</p>

<p>And by show us, I mean show us where its actually racially motivated.</p>

<p>While you do that, show us how the history of America shows a pattern of racial injustice from the power structure vs these innocent unarmed white men, where police constantly used force and unleashed dogs on them and fire hoses etc. Show us where these white males had to deal with redlining and work discrimination, and how they could not eat in certain places because of their color. Don&#39;t give us one case here or one case there, no, show us how this has historically been a problem.</p>

<p>Then show us how propping up the agenda to discuss those poor black men getting killed vs not showing the white men getting killed by blacks has historically been a thing. Show us where Fox News for example has subscribed to this notion and others before them.</p>

<p>Then when you are done being a fucking idiot and realize you wrote a racially charged post to whine and cry about something that is clearly not equal maybe then you can find a way to make a difference in the world. </p>

<p>This post is pathetic, which is understandable. What makes it AWFUL is that its 92% upvoted by other whiny white males who as usual look for a way to talk about themselves other than &quot;the others&quot;.</p>

<p>Fuck this post and 92% of the 717 people who upvoted. Fucking idiots.</p>

<p>It doesnt matter that you arrived at a correct notion of &quot;its not about black or white, its about rich vs poor&quot; when you use the &quot;black cops kill white men too durr durr&quot; angle. Because its fucking BULLSHIT. </p>

<p>Also, its important to note that racism is a WHITE PROBLEM. YOU are the hornets nest they fuck with. Not anyone else. They fuck with YOUR HEADS. And you people eat it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Work together&quot; has to mean whites truly accepting they are equal to everyone else and not above them. The culture of white superiority is not one they naturally believe; it is taught in this country. THAT is what divides us. Our history books, our media all teach it. Its the fabric  that binds this country together. white males = superman style propaganda. Break thru THAT as a people. </p>

<p>I am saying they are playing the &quot;nonsense&quot; because it is what we are most likely to watch thus it is the most profitable for them.  The missing Malaysian flight does not divide us, but it certainly drew a lot of attention.  Among the most of any recent news event.</p>
