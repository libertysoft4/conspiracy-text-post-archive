I see alot of, &quot;Climate Change is bullshit because Al Gore makes money off of it!&quot; but I have yet to see a thorough explanation of this claim, or why that fact negates the reality of AGW. For the record, I believe the 97% &#39;consensus&#39; is fabricated bullshit, and I believe the so-called science behind AGW is massively exaggerated, but I would like to hear some well thought out arguments.

<p>Huber and Knutti (2011): &quot;Even for a reconstruction with high variability in total irradiance, solar forcing contributed only about0.07°C (0.03-0.13°C) to the warming since 1950.&quot; </p>

<p>Erlykin 2009: &quot;We deduce that the maximum recent increase in the mean surface temperature of the Earth which can be ascribed to solar activity is 14% of the observed global warming.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0901/0901.0515v1.pdf">http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0901/0901.0515v1.pdf</a> </p>

<p>Benestad 2009: &quot;Our analysis shows that the most likely contribution from solar forcing a global warming is 7 ± 1% for the 20th century and is negligible for warming since 1980.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009JGRD..11414101B">http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009JGRD..11414101B</a> </p>

<p>Lockwood 2008: &quot;It is shown that the contribution of solar variability to the temperature trend since 1987 is small and downward; the best estimate is -1.3% and the 2? confidence level sets the uncertainty range of -0.7 to -1.9%.&quot; </p>

<p>Lean 2008: &quot;According to this analysis, solar forcing contributed negligible long-term warming in the past 25 years and 10% of the warming in the past 100 years...&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Miklankovitch cycles explain the majority of the variation in the beginning and ending of ice ages over the past 1,000,000 years. But there is a CO2 threshold that is reached during the interglacials that start the advancement of glaciers and ice sheets. The higher the CO2 PPM in the atmosphere, the warmer the climate, and the later the ice age will start. Luckily, the current CO2 PPM is so high that we won&#39;t have another ice age no matter the current tilt and or placement of Earth&#39;s orbit.  Which is a good thing. Under pre-industrial CO2 PPM, we would to expect have another commencement of an ice age after 2000 years, but not now. </p>

<p>Tell that to my broke ass friends who are working towards their masters and PhD&#39;s.  I have a degree in atmospheric and oceanic science.  I have seen many arguments on both sides.  I have spent years learning about this stuff in classes, working with biologists, working with computer modelers, and working with meteorologists and climate scientists.  I am convinced by the evidence that I have seen and by the blatant misrepresentations of the evidence that I have seen by the other side.  I am completely at a loss as to why you think that the people who study climate change are making money off of it.  The majority of them are making 30-50k a year after 6-8 years of higher education. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said before, I&#39;ve seen plenty of misrepresentations of what the evidence is.  I have yet to see compelling arguments as to why we shouldn&#39;t be concerned about the impact that humans are having on global climate and I have seen entire textbooks and firsthand evidence from a variety of different fields as to why we should be concerned.  If you point me to something that you find compelling, I&#39;ll give it a read.</p>

<p>The closest I&#39;ve seen is the work of Judith Curry, but even her work points towards humans being the dominant factor in the recent warming trend.  Her blog posts tend to be much more vitriolic and &quot;denialist&quot; than her actual scientific work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there are plenty of scientists who study things like forests, ocean currents, the sun, ancient reefs who find that they are all correlated to climate change. I worked in a lab that studied coral proteins and how they are effected by a warming ocean. Ocean temperatures are going up, the jet stream is getting wavier causing pockets of hot air to stay in place and cause bleaching events across reefs (SSTs), pH is going down threatening the bottom of the food chain (plankton that are trying to build shells), plankton and tropical fish are able to move further to the poles....these are all observations that can support that the Earth is changing. We know that CO2 will affect ocean chemistry differently and we know that burning fossil fuels releases CO2 (20 lbs per gallon of gasoline).... but people continually will turn their cheek and act like ocean acidification isn&#39;t ALSO a link to human activities. At this point, if you refuse to believe that we are responsible because you can&#39;t personally feel the heat.....AT LEAST consider the fact that the ocean is becoming more acidic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Climate Change is more complex than just about any other scientific issue.  Huge time-scales, incomplete data, interdisciplinary, involves human behavior, etc.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s an issue where we just have to trust the consensus of the experts.  A layperson can&#39;t pick out one chart or one argument and use it to prove/disprove the issue.  See <a href="http://www.billdietrich.me/Reason/ClimateChange.html#Real">http://www.billdietrich.me/Reason/ClimateChange.html#Real</a> for more.</p>

<p>Fortunately, most of the &quot;fixes&quot; for climate change are good things to do anyway, even if GCC is a hoax or something.  Stop pollution, go to renewable energy, end our dependence on foreign oil, etc.  Which then result in better health, better environment, fewer extinctions, etc.</p>

<p>And we can do things such as a carbon tax in a way that won&#39;t kill the economy.  Make it revenue-neutral: refund all the money via a general income tax rebate.  That penalizes carbon emission, without adding a net overall tax increase.</p>

Interesting to note the last twenty years of stagnate warming of our planet may have been a reason for the name change.

<p>The only real debate anymore is with someone who is completely uneducated on the topic but spring-loaded with knee-jerk responses. If we wait for someone else to provide us with a thorough explanation of what the truth is, then how can we claim to know anything at all?

<p>Fact: The greenhouse gas qualities of carbon dioxide have been known for over a century and its role in the current warming of the planet has been confirmed through multiple lines of research. The greenhouse gas qualities of carbon dioxide have been known for over a century. In 1861, John Tyndal published laboratory results identifyin­­­­­­­­­g carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas that absorbed heat rays (longwave radiation)­­­­­­­­­. Since then, the absorptive qualities of carbon dioxide have been more precisely quantified by decades of laboratory measuremen­­­­­­­­­ts (Herzberg 1953, Burch 1962, Burch 1970).</p>

<p>Human CO2 emissions upset the natural balance of the carbon cycle. Man-made CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by a third since the pre-indust­­­­­­­­­ri­a­l era, creating an artificial forcing of global temperatur­­­­­­­­­es which is warming the planet. While fossil-fue­­­­­­­­­l derived CO2 is a very small component of the global carbon cycle, the extra CO2 is cumulative because the natural carbon exchange cannot absorb all the additional CO2.</p>

<p>Fact: There isn&#39;t a single credible scientific body that has studied the issue that disputes the fact that human industrial activity is primarily responsible for the current warming trend throughout the world and is not warning us that it presents dire consequences for all of us if the concentrations of atmospheric CO2 are not reduced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The terms &quot;climate change&quot; and &quot;global warming&quot; are essentially interchangeable when they are used in reference to the pattern of overall warming of the earth&#39;s climate that we are currently experiencing. The term &quot;climate change&quot; was probably introduced in 1977 with the peer reviewed publication &quot;Climate Change&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://link.springer.com/journal/10584">http://link.springer.com/journal/10584</a></p>

<p>It was Frank Luntz a Republican political consultant who popularized the term.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Luntz#Global_warming">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Luntz#Global_warming</a></p>

<p>&quot;...the last twenty years of stagnate warming of our planet...&quot;
As for this canard here&#39;s a fairly succinct response from the UK Met Office: &quot;You only need to look at 1998 to see a record-breaking warm year caused by a very strong El Nino. In the last couple of years, the underlying warming is partially masked caused by a strong La Nina. Despite this, 11 of the last 13 years were the warmest ever recorded. Average global temperaturesare now some 0.75 degrees C warmer than they were 100 years ago. Since the mid-1970s, the increase in temperature has averaged more than 0.15 degrees C per decade.&quot; &quot;As a result of such fluctuations [El Nino], global average temperature trends calculated over ten year periods have varied since the mid-1970s, from a modest cooling toa warming rate of more than 0.3 degrees C per decade. Similar behaviour is also seen in individual model predictions of future climate change where the long-term warming trend is forecast to exceed 2 degrees C per century. Even then, due to natural variations in climate, we expect to see ten-year periods both globally and regionally with little or no warming and other ten-year periods with very rapid warming. This complex behaviour of the climate system shows why we need to examine much longer periods than ten years if we are to fully understand and quantify how the climate is changing.</p>

No, the crux of the AGW argument is that global warming, caused by human beings, is raising the planet&#39;s temperature to a level that will cause all sorts of catastrophic changes.</p>

<p>The answer is, no, human activity is not raising the global temperature of the earth by any amount that is significant enough to measure. Our impact on the global temperature is so small, it is unimportant.</p>

<p>A few facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>There has been no global warming for 18 years.</li>
<li>The advocates of the AGW theory cannot account for this lack of global warming.</li>
<li>None of the AGW scientists&#39; computer models predicted this lack of global warming.</li>
<li>Almost all of the predictions of future climate events made by pro-AGW scientists have been completely wrong.</li>
<li>They predicted the polar bears were going extinct. Wrong!</li>
<li>They predicted the Greenland ice cap would vanish. Wrong!</li>
<li>They predicted that Arctic sea ice would disappear. Wrong!</li>
<li>They predicted that the number of hurricanes would increase. Wrong!</li>
<li>They predicted that the hurricanes would be stronger. Wrong!</li>
<li>They predicted more forest fires. Wrong!</li>
<li>They predicted deserts would spread. Wrong!</li>
<li>They predicted sea levels would rise and flood costal cities. Wrong!</li>
<li>They predicted massive increased deaths due to extreme heat. Wrong!</li>
<li>They predicted the permafrost would melt, with countless dire consequences. Wrong!</li>
<li>They predicted an enormous release of methane from the melting north. Wrong!</li>
<li>They predicted Antarctic sea ice was shrinking. Wrong!</li>
<li>They predicted massive increases of plagues around the world. Wrong!</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing these AGW cultists have predicted has come true. None of their computer models have been correct. They are complete and utter frauds. AGW is a fraud designed to transfer wealth and power to those who are running it. The mass of people who have embraced the AGW hypothesis are motivated by religious fanaticism. They are members of a modern cult, although most of them don&#39;t realize it.</p>

<p>AGW is supported by a combination of fools and crooks. The hypothesis is completely false, and claims made by its followers have been disproven countless times. All they have left is name calling and character assassination.</p>

<p>Fact: This is primarily due to increasing concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere caused by the burning of fossil fuels.</p>

<p>Fact: The greenhouse gas qualities of carbon dioxide have been known for over a century and its role in the current warming of the planet has been confirmed through multiple lines of research. The greenhouse gas qualities of carbon dioxide have been known for over a century. In 1861, John Tyndal published laboratory results identifyin­­­­­­­­­g carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas that absorbed heat rays (longwave radiation)­­­­­­­­­. Since then, the absorptive qualities of carbon dioxide have been more precisely quantified by decades of laboratory measuremen­­­­­­­­­ts (Herzberg 1953, Burch 1962, Burch 1970).</p>

<p>Human CO2 emissions upset the natural balance of the carbon cycle. Man-made CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by a third since the pre-indust­­­­­­­­­ri­a­l era, creating an artificial forcing of global temperatur­­­­­­­­­es which is warming the planet. While fossil-fue­­­­­­­­­l derived CO2 is a very small component of the global carbon cycle, the extra CO2 is cumulative because the natural carbon exchange cannot absorb all the additional CO2.</p>

<p>Fact: There isn&#39;t a single credible scientific body that has studied the issue that disputes the fact that human industrial activity is primarily responsible for the current warming trend throughout the world and is not warning us that it presents dire consequences for all of us if the concentrations of atmospheric CO2 are not reduced.</p>
