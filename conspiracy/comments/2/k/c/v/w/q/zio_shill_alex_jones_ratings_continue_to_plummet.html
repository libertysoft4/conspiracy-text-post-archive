    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. But as always, the collective effort and what they are investigating or reporting on is never a subject for admiration or respect with some people. The only thing they are interested in is ridiculing Alex as a distraction attack, look at Chelsea Manning, Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, etc -- same thing going on there &quot;Y&#39;aaaarrr a traitor!!&quot;.  </p>

<p>Say something that might make a little sense, or make somebody think twice, and you&#39;re suddenly a lightning rod for verbal attacks to deflect attention from the actual story. Just as the media portrays Wikileaks as if the entire collective effort is nothing but Julian Assange. There&#39;s a crowd of people who are also unable to see past Alex Jones, and dismiss the contents Infowars reports on the basis that they don&#39;t like Alex Jones as a personality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could you be more naive? Would corporations voluntarily disband after the government was torn down? The destruction of the government would remove any checks of corporate power that haven&#39;t yet been removed. Say goodbye to the 60 hour work week, overtime, minimum wage, health and safety regulations, etc. We would truly be slaves if corporations had total power.</p>

<p>That is why it is so important that we take back OUR government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know basic economics? Without godvernment there would be no corporations. They only exist because of godvernment regulations. If godvernment were to dissappear tomorrow, all of the corporate power would be lost.</p>

<p>No matter how small a government starts, it will always turn into what we have today. How would we be slaves? We are slaves under godvernment control because they give so much power to corporations. They have monopolies on most things and fuck small businesses because they can&#39;t compete with corporations because of government power</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back to my original question. Do you think corporations would voluntarily disband if the government were to cease to exist? I can guarantee you that they would not. </p>

<p>Under that scenario there would no longer be ANY check on corporate power. And yes, I realize that alot of these checks have been dismantled after the corporate coupe d&#39;etat of the US government in the 1980s. But alot of the New Deal policies are still in place. Without these policies US workers would be reduced to working 12 hour shifts (if not more) seven days a week for a pittance (probably less than a dollar a day) in terrible conditions with no health and safety regulations whatsoever.</p>

<p>The dismantling of the government would not reduce corporate power, instead if would increase it 100 fold.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I think they would disband? No. But their power would be greatly diminished. The thing is without government like I said before, there would be more competition. More competition equals more jobs and the best products. With the monopoly power corporations have because of government, they are able to under cut the competition and along with Obama care they fuck small businesses. So without that, the small businesses would be able to thrive. </p>

<p>How would it increase? Without government anyone would be free to start companies to compete with the former corporations. Leading to greater a greater economy for everyone. Have you ever read rothbard? </p>

</blockquote>

<p>How? Capitalism allows free markets. Free markets mean competition. Competition means choice. Choice means competition. They will be competing with each other for the customers money. People will vote with their dollars. If they don&#39;t like it, they can go somewhere else and no company would be &quot;to big to fail&quot; </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Small businesses aren&#39;t able to compete with corporations because of mandates and things like Obama care. Without government, there would be tons more competition as there would be no imaginary force saying you can&#39;t do it</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes they would. Yes free market capitalism is about profits, but they have to take care of their workers. If not they can go work somewhere else and or people will not go there if conditions are like that. Small businesses would be able to offer a great wage, more people would have  more money to spend. Competition is best for an economy ,not monopolization. That is why I believe free market capitalism is the best form of economy and why I am ancap. </p>

<p>This has nothing to do with the conversation but are yoy a Marxist? Thanks for the convo as well, I&#39;m enjoying it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism leads to monopoly because the natural, unrestrained market forces will create monopolies from the most successful commercial entities. You can see it the telecom industry for example. There is a oligopoly where a few corporations own the entire infrastructure. Eventually, these corporations will merge until only one stands.</p>

<p>Obamacare is a right wing healthcare plan that expanded the role of private insurance. I&#39;m not sure what relevance it has to the discussion.  I suppose you are saying that small businesses can&#39;t afford the insurance required of them and therefore can&#39;t compete. If there was a single payer system like the left actually wanted this would not be a problem.</p>

<p>These workers would have no choice if the government no longer existed. Look at third world countries as an example. They have no government regulations policing corporations and corporations are in complete control. These workers work in slave like conditions for less than a dollar a day and that is the best job they can get.</p>

<p>Yes. If you listen to Alex Jones for any length of time, you will see that he does not tolerate any dispute or contradiction or disagreement. It&#39;s his way or the highway.  If any of his crew ever tried to put out a story that he personally had issues with, they would be gone, and they know it. They are there to be his puppets, nothing more. They have less freedom of expression than the talking heads on CNN.</p>

Maybe if he governed himself, argued his point of view with vast amounts of &quot;poise and rationality&quot;, the public perception of his views would be more accepted, of at least debated amongst the commons, instead of neo-am-radio enthusiasts.  I began to dislike him after his agressive and vulgar exchanges with the families and friends of those who were killed by the teen shooter in Santa Barbara in California.  Alex Jones has become the Al Sharpton of the &quot;liberal&quot; causes.

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, Alex Jones is a radio talkshow host.  These, now daily, attacks on him by the same race-baiting, Jew haters speaks volumes.  I&#39;ve listen to Alex, weekly, for about 7-8 years now and the only movement I&#39;ve seen him lead is his own.  If you don&#39;t like him, turn off the radio.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The failure of Alex Jones to talk about the Jews, in their various forms (wealthy manipulators of congress, controllers of the media in the West, Zionists, Israelis) and their relationship to the New World Order makes him irrelevent, in my opinion. Jones is all about the New World Order and what he likes to call the &quot;globalists&quot; but he never talks about the role of the Jews in the New World Order. Never.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He literally said that most people Israel killed were Hamas and not children/civilians. He always calls it tribal warfare to prevent his listeners from caring or delving deeper. He cuts off any caller who speaks the truth about Palestine and even played out Max Keiser with music after he said Israeli genocide and Max turned to the camera with a knowing grin and said &quot;there&#39;s the music.&quot; He is a disinfo agent at its best when it comes to his zionist masters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could you be more naive? Would corporations voluntarily disband after the government was torn down? The destruction of the government would remove any checks of corporate power that haven&#39;t yet been removed. Say goodbye to the 60 hour work week, overtime, minimum wage, health and safety regulations, etc. We would truly be slaves if corporations had total power.</p>

<p>That is why it is so important that we take back OUR government.</p>
