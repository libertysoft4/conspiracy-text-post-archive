    <div class="md"><p>The terms &quot;climate change&quot; and &quot;global warming&quot; are essentially interchangeable when they are used in reference to the pattern of overall warming of the earth&#39;s climate that we are currently experiencing. The term &quot;climate change&quot; was probably introduced in 1977 with the peer reviewed publication &quot;Climate Change&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://link.springer.com/journal/10584">http://link.springer.com/journal/10584</a></p>

<p>It was Frank Luntz a Republican political consultant who popularized the term.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Luntz#Global_warming">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Luntz#Global_warming</a></p>

<p>&quot;...the globe wasn&#39;t getting any warming for 18 fucking years.&quot;
As for this canard here&#39;s a fairly succinct response from the UK Met Office: &quot;You only need to look at 1998 to see a record-breaking warm year caused by a very strong El Nino. In the last couple of years, the underlying warming is partially masked caused by a strong La Nina. Despite this, 11 of the last 13 years were the warmest ever recorded. Average global temperaturesare now some 0.75 degrees C warmer than they were 100 years ago. Since the mid-1970s, the increase in temperature has averaged more than 0.15 degrees C per decade.&quot; &quot;As a result of such fluctuations [El Nino], global average temperature trends calculated over ten year periods have varied since the mid-1970s, from a modest cooling toa warming rate of more than 0.3 degrees C per decade. Similar behaviour is also seen in individual model predictions of future climate change where the long-term warming trend is forecast to exceed 2 degrees C per century. Even then, due to natural variations in climate, we expect to see ten-year periods both globally and regionally with little or no warming and other ten-year periods with very rapid warming. This complex behaviour of the climate system shows why we need to examine much longer periods than ten years if we are to fully understand and quantify how the climate is changing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that the focus on warming has caused many people to lose sight of the big issues of pollution and population. We have no evidence that industrial output causes warming, but we have mountains of evidence that it&#39;s poisoning <em>everything</em>. </p>

<p>Yes, there&#39;s big money at stake over AGW because it&#39;s the major political issue outside of killing brown people. Once committed to a political agenda it&#39;s personal and professional suicide to retract a position. So more money is thrown at it and those receiving the money are now personally committed to the issue as well. It&#39;s a gravy-train to nowhere all right. </p>

Wrong. Here are the facts for you:
Fact: The earth&#39;s climate is warming at a rate and into a temperature range never before experienced by homo sapiens.</p>

<p>Fact: This is primarily due to increasing concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere caused by the burning of fossil fuels.</p>

<p>Fact: The greenhouse gas qualities of carbon dioxide have been known for over a century and its role in the current warming of the planet has been confirmed through multiple lines of research. The greenhouse gas qualities of carbon dioxide have been known for over a century. In 1861, John Tyndal published laboratory results identifyin­­­­­­­­­g carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas that absorbed heat rays (longwave radiation)­­­­­­­­­. Since then, the absorptive qualities of carbon dioxide have been more precisely quantified by decades of laboratory measuremen­­­­­­­­­ts (Herzberg 1953, Burch 1962, Burch 1970).</p>

<p>Human CO2 emissions upset the natural balance of the carbon cycle. Man-made CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by a third since the pre-indust­­­­­­­­­ri­a­l era, creating an artificial forcing of global temperatur­­­­­­­­­es which is warming the planet. While fossil-fue­­­­­­­­­l derived CO2 is a very small component of the global carbon cycle, the extra CO2 is cumulative because the natural carbon exchange cannot absorb all the additional CO2.</p>

<p>Fact: There isn&#39;t a single credible scientific body that has studied the issue that disputes the fact that human industrial activity is primarily responsible for the current warming trend throughout the world and is not warning us that it presents dire consequences for all of us if the concentrations of atmospheric CO2 are not reduced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>BTW most of the scientists who are conducting and publishing the research into the issue of anthropogenic global warming don&#39;t earn much more than a high school science teacher if that much and many if not hold tenure in universities or colleges so their jobs are quite secure no matter what position they take on this issue. The big money is to made shilling for the boys at Big Carbon (Koch Industries, Exon Mobil, etc). BTW such &quot;skeptics&quot; as Lindzen, Spencer and Curry seem to be doing pretty well for themselves and the position that they&#39;ve taken certainly hasn&#39;t hurt their careers. Finally your assumption that any concern about the threat posed by anthropogenic global warming is based on some kind of a political bias is complete and total nonsense. The issue is about science. Got that? It has nothing to do with any political ideology. Only in the US with the dominance of simplistic, reactionary political forces like the teaparty and the distorted influence exerted on government by Big Carbon along with Canada and Australia (heavily dependant on the fossil fuel industry) is the issue of climate change viewed as political. Elsewhere it is viewed as strickly a scientific issue and rightly so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, fair enough - I&#39;ll dial it back a bit. You&#39;re statement, &quot;there&#39;s big money at stake over AGW because it&#39;s the major political issue,&quot; implies that the scientific evidence for anthropogenic global warming, whether it&#39;s from government based agencies like NASA or NOAA or from the multitude of peer reviewed research is suspect because the sceintists who are involve in this receive some degree of government funding to support their work. The conclusion that one would have to draw from that premise is that they are essentially lying. First of all there is absolutely no evidence of that. Secondly if those scientists are motivated to lie because they may receive some funding they are doing a lousy job of it since they really aren&#39;t paid that much for their work. Beyond that I have to wonder what would have motivated the US government to compel them to lie. Consider the fact that that climate scientists in the US have been presenting essentially the same position concerning global warming regardless of who was in the Whitehouse whether it was Carter, Reagan, GH Bush, Clinton, GW Bush or Obama. I wonder why. Finally those academics like Lindzen, Spencer and Curry who have taken a &quot;skeptical&quot; position have not suffered; their positions are quite secure. My argument that this should not be seen as a political issue stands. The claim that it is motivated by a political, presumably left of center ideology has no basis in fact. As for business profits being a motivator that fails as well when one considers the fact that the fossil fuel industry has far more influence than any businesses involved in renewable energy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t like to use the term &quot;lying&quot; when discussing most of the work. There have been some blatant instances of lying but that can be expected in any field, and it&#39;s occured on both sides of the debate. What we have here is s disfunctional system where success is rewarded. This may piss you off but we can reduce this to stimulus/response in the same way that dogs perform for treats. The original purpose of the behaviour is lost in the expectation of final reward. The dog is not &quot;lying&quot; when offering up what the owner wants to see, the dog is just stuck in a system of performance and reward.</p>

<p>Reward in any field of endeavor is a paycheck. Think also of people who work in munition plants. They&#39;re not by and large bad people, just caught up in the system and that&#39;s where they find themselves. And, those people are going to react strongly to measures that would necessitate a scaling back of production that would cost jobs. The self-interest of those people is just as responsible for on-going killing as are those who order it.</p>

<p>AGW researchers are not bad people either. Take a look at the mandates of the various government agencies that conduct research, and those that fund outside research. You&#39;ll find a commitment to AGW right there. Anyone wanting a job will have to support the aims of the organization, and those aims swung away from pure science to applied science as soon as the mandate was declared. AGW is no longer a scientific topic of interest, it&#39;s a politically created occupation for most of those involved.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been tossed around that the most noted AGW skeptics tend to be older and secure in their jobs. No argument. It&#39;s because they&#39;re secure that they can speak their minds. If any of those people were currently looking for work they would find little outside of that which is currently favoured by fundind agencies. Most of those funding agencies swing with the political winds and the political wind is in favour of AGW. </p>

<p>You&#39;re correct in saying that AGW has been <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/legislative_reports/fcce-report-to-congress.pdf">on the agenda over several administrations</a>. With each administration the funding has grown. Whenever this topic has come up in the past I&#39;ve linked to the US budget office 2010 budget for AGW research. It used to be freely available and showed that in 2010 alone the US commited $739 billion. Here&#39;s the orginal link that now requires a password, click if you like (<a href="http://www.usgcrp.gov/usgcrp/Library/ocp2009/ocp2009-budget-gen.htm">http://www.usgcrp.gov/usgcrp/Library/ocp2009/ocp2009-budget-gen.htm</a>). Ask yourself what could be so inflammatory that your nation&#39;s governement no longer wants you to access your own budget. We&#39;re talking about a huge sum of money that goes for salaries, offices and research paraphenalia. Once in place all of that must be maintained so the funding must be on-going regardless of results. What we have then is an establishment that prizes it&#39;s own continuity and survival as much as any other institution or establishment. It&#39;s been said that institutions become immortal once they attain a size where demoloshing them becomes more expensive than maintaining them. I&#39;m not saying that AGW has reached the point of immortality, but acknowledging errors would put many thousands our of work and leave of a mountain of now useless equipment. Voters don&#39;t care much for the idea of returning a person to office once their main policy platform has been demolished. Icebergs would have to be flowing down Pennsylvania Avenue before Obama would reverse his political position because doing so is political suicide for him and his party.</p>

<p>You may recall the Peter Gleik affair where he obtained an internal memo from Heartland expecting to find billions in contributions from Exxon. Insead he found $22K which was not ear-marked for any AGW-skeptic programs . There is no comparison at all between the massive public funding for AGW research and education programs versus the paltry funding for skeptics. There is much talk about it but no one has ever been able to locate any of the supposed billions spent by Exxon. </p>

<p>If the US govt had spent even half of the budget dedicated to further research to actual energy programs would we be in the state we&#39;re in? Funding for alternative programs now has to compete with the established research programs for funding. It&#39;s a Catch-22 revolving around established budget commitments to research over answers. Are you getting hot under the collar? I&#39;ve been in that state for a very long time.</p>

<p>My suggestion has been for governments to get away from funding further research and get on with reversing our current practises. But then there are lobbies to consider, the expected backlash on the internet over cuts to funding, and so on. Even if we don&#39;t see eye to eye on warming we can agree that the practises of industry need to change.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I don&#39;t like to use the term &quot;lying&quot; when discussing most of the work.&quot;
Okay then, how about &quot;fudging&quot;, &quot;stretching the truth&quot;, &quot;displaying mendacity&quot;, or Shakespeare&#39;s favorite - &quot;equivocation&quot;? 
&quot;There have been some blatant instances of lying...&quot; Is that right? Then prove it and cite your sources. Your seemingly generous qualification that it&#39;s occurred on both sides of the debate is irrelevant. 
You&#39;re reference to canine behavior is clever but in this case we&#39;re not talking about dogs; we&#39;re talking about very intelligent and highly educated human beings. 
People who work in munitions plants or in any private industry obviously have a vested interest in insuring that there is a demand for their goods and services among consumers whether they are governments or the general public. As for climate scientists who are tenured professors in universities and colleges, they’re not paid on commission and they don’t receive salary bonuses for the research that they are working on. Yes they receive a grant but it’s not a lot of money and with that they are expected to hire assistants and pay for the use of the facilities they need. It’s hardly a gravy train. Besides what they are frequently involved in is sort of research that could support the current consensus view or it just as easily might not. BTW it’s not a deep dark secret. Here’s an example of the kind of research funded through NSF grants:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=11699">http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=11699</a></p>

<p>And yes, if this research actually discovered a previously unknown or underestimated carbon sink or negative feedback there would be no effort to conceal or suppress this information. But then I’m pretty confident that there’s nothing unusual hidden at Area 51. Perhaps that makes me the sceptic. 
“You&#39;ll find a commitment to AGW right there.” 
Really? Prove it and cite your sources. I just showed you an example and it’s pretty innocuous. 
“Anyone wanting a job will have to support the aims of the organization…” 
So you say but you certainly haven’t provided any proof and of course if you do, I’ll be asking you to cite your sources. 
Your assumption that any concern about the threat posed by anthropogenic global warming is based on some kind of a (presumably left of centre) ideology political bias is complete and total nonsense. The issue is about science. Got that? It has nothing to do with any political ideology. Only in the US with the dominance of simplistic, reactionary political forces like the tea party and the distorted influence exerted on government by Big Carbon (Koch Industries, Exxon Mobil, etc.) along with Canada and Australia (heavily dependant on the fossil fuel industry) is the issue of climate change viewed as political. Elsewhere it is viewed as strictly a scientific issue and rightly so.
 “…the most noted AGW skeptics tend to be older and secure in their jobs.”
Please name a few of these older AGW sceptics who are secure in their jobs and please cite the links to some of their research which presumably refutes the established consensus concerning anthropogenic global warming.  BTW if you’re going to include the noted physicist Freeman Dyson the man is now retired and he has in fact never published any peer reviewed research on the subject of climate change.
As for the rest of your assertions (If any of those people were currently looking for work… If any of those people were currently looking for work…) prove them please and cite your sources. Simply making these claims without evidence of any just doesn&#39;t cut it. As for your continuing claim that any concern about anthropogenic global warming is politically motivated, I’ve already responded to that. 
 I have to question the accuracy of your figures since according to the Congressional Budget Office the amount of funding for federal climate change funding between 1998 and 2013 never went over $10 billion (based on 2009 dollars) and although it is projected to go higher it is not expected to go over $12 billion.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/03-26-climatechange.pdf">http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/03-26-climatechange.pdf</a></p>

<p><a href="http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43227.pdf">http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43227.pdf</a></p>

<p>The funding available in 2009 under ARRA totalled $35.7 billion for activities that the CBO judged are related to climate change. So it appears that your figure of $739 billion is a bit of an exaggeration to say the least. BTW I found the information I needed to be very readily available and I saw nothing here that was inflammatory. I’m sorry but this definitely deflates the rest of your arguments. 
My argument concerning the fossil fuel industry’s influence is based on the extent to which it contributes to the election campaigns of politicians or operates its own advertising campaigns to support its agendas.  During the 2009 and 2010 campaigning for the 111th Congress the fossil fuel industry contributed more than $25 million dollars. That’s not pocket change. Couldn’t the renewable energy companies influence political campaigns as well? Definitely not to the same extent. Neither the largest wind or solar generation manufacturers (Vestas and First Solar) appear in the Financial Times&#39; list of the world&#39;s 500 largest companies while there are 16 oil companies in the of the top 100.
Any argument that the scientists who are studying the issue of climate change are going to benefit from a shift to renewables and are therefore motivated to skew (in other words lie) the data fails because of the simple fact that their expertise would not in demand for the development of renewable energy. Businesses that build wind and solar generators have no need for physicists or meteorologists; they need mechanical and electrical engineers. Therefore if climate researchers are in this for the money they’re doing a damn poor job of it. Through all of your response you have consistently failed to present one single piece of peer reviewed  scientific research which refutes the established consensus concerning anthropogenic global warming. To simply dismiss the mountain of research from a wide range of very credible sources from all over the world simply because you imagine some kind of a conspiracy (there’s no other word for it) is in the end pretty lame. Get back to me when or if you can ever find such research. I have cited plenty of scientific evidence to support that consensus while you have offered up nothing. Nothing comes of nothing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The consensus is easy to refute. AGW claims that global temperatures and CO2 levels were stable prior to 1850. They were not. LIA, MWP and the preceeding fluctuations prove that it&#39;s not so. That research was done and accepted long before AGW showed up. The current warming is nothing more than another natural fluctuation. There is no way for you or any other AGW advocate to prove otherwise. The null rules when proof is impossible.</p>

You&#39;re wrong. CO2 levels prior to 1850 were stable at around 280 ppm.</p>

<p>Prior to that time CO2 levels fluctuated as did global temperatures although going back 800,000 years there is no evidence that CO2 levels went above 300 ppm.</p>

<p>Over the past 2,000 years temperatures have fluctuated.</p>

<p>Although there have been a range of temperature readings (see the graph on page 2) none of them indicate that global temperatures over the time period shown (which includes the MWP and the LIA) ever warmed as much as it is now. More importantly what caused the MWP and the LIA is undertstood by scientists today. </p>

<p>If as you say the current warming is nothing more than another natural fluctuation, then please explain what is causing that natural fluctuation. When there is a change in the earth&#39;s climate as significant as the one we are now experiencing the cause cannot be simply dismissed as another natural fluctuation. Natural fluctuations happen for a reason as was the case with the the MWP and the LIA. However there is absolutely no evidence that the warming that we are now experiencing is the result of anything other than the increasing concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere brought about by the burning of fossil fuels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the greatest concerns today is outgassing of sequestered CO2. During cool periods CO2 is sequestered and in warm periods it&#39;s released. That means that the 280ppm recorded for the end of the LIA is the product of sequestration after a period of high CO2 in the MWP, which was due to outgassing. The graph you linked to is wrong, and it has to be wrong because the physical processes we see today are the same as those of the past. </p>

<p>A comprehensive analysis (<a href="http://pattern-recognition-in-physics.com/pub/prp-2-36-2014.pdf">http://pattern-recognition-in-physics.com/pub/prp-2-36-2014.pdf</a>) shows a MWP warmer than today. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to give you the consensus view from outside the field of climate science to explain natural fluctuations. Given the current geography of Earth and stage of the Milankovitch cycle we expect that the planet has settled around a climate mean that varies naturally due to competing feedback mechanisms. For instance, warmth increases evaporation over time leading to an increase in cloud cover that leads to natural cooling. Milankovitch cycles play a role in overturning the current climate regime on the order of thousands of years. Within those cycles climate varies around a mean on the order of hundreds of years. Within those hundreds year periods are the short term modifiers such as ENSO. What we conclude is that climate is dynamic rather than (more or less) static as AGW insists. Climate may only effect the thin skin and atmosphere of Earth, but that is still a very large area that takes time to warm and time to cool. Feedback mechanisms can&#39;t shift temperature trends quickly.</p>

<p>If we accept that the MWP was a natural period, and that the LIA was a natural period, then we have to conclude that the current warming is another natural period. CO2 increase and decrease follows temperature as I mentioned above.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off &quot;Testing the hockey-stick hypothesis by statistical analyses of a large dataset of proxy records&quot; by Guido Travaglini is published in a journal that has no scientific credibility.  “Pattern Recognition in Physics” is a joke. The editors were noted “skeptic” Nils-Axl Morner (a geologist who has never published a single peer reviewed research paper on the subject of climate change) and some guy named Sid-Ali Ouadfeul from the “Algerian Petroleum Institute”. The journal was terminated with prejudice by its own publisher:</p>

<p><a href="http://pattern-recognition-in-physics.net/">http://pattern-recognition-in-physics.net/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_Recognition_in_Physics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_Recognition_in_Physics</a></p>

<p>As for the author Guido Travaglini, the man is a professor of economics at the University of Rome and he has no training in any aspect of climate science. As well citing as he does the discredited &quot;work&quot; of Montford, McIntyre, McKitrick, Soon and Baliunas only compounds his own lack of credibility. 
As for the validity of Mann&#39;s work and the so-called hockey stick graph, an independent assessment was conducted by the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-006-9105-7">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-006-9105-7</a> ). They reconstructed temperatures employing a variety of statistical techniques. Their results found slightly different temperatures in the early 15th Century but they confirmed the principal results of the original hockey stick - that the warming trend and temperatures over the last few decades are unprecedented over at least the last 2,000 years. 
As for your argument that the current high CO2 levels are an effect of outgassing of CO2 sequestered during the LIA this is preposterous.  First, there are any number of ice core studies that show a constant rise in CO2 during interglacial periods, including the Holocene ( <a href="http://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/24/">http://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/24/</a> ). As well, isotope studies can distinguish CO2 added to the atmosphere by natural processes from that released by burning fossil fuels. So there is no question that the current extreme CO2 levels are anthropogenic.</p>

<p>In fact the concentration of CO2 in the air barely changed over the past 2000 years until the Industrial revolution ( <a href="http://cdiac.ornl.gov/images/three_gases_historical.jpg">http://cdiac.ornl.gov/images/three_gases_historical.jpg</a> ).</p>

No, it does not follow that since the MWP and the LIA were the result of natural causes that are understood by scientists today then the warming that we are experiencing is also the result of a natural causes.

    <div class="md"><p>The fate of the journal is irrelevant. You looked only at tyhe publishers&#39; page and did not look deeper into the cause of termination. Copernicus Publications publishes primarily in the geo-sciences. It was killed after a special issue of several articles which concluded that AGW was not valid. The backlash from subscribers gave the publishers cause to terminate the journal in the same way that the Editor of <em>Remote Sensing</em> (Wolfgang Wagner) was forced out after publishing a paper by Spencer &amp; Braswell. The Travaglini paper was peer reviewed, revised, and accepted. You can claim &quot;pal-review&quot; as an excuse, but pal-review is the norm for pro-AGW papers. Double standards don&#39;t seem to bother pro-AGW people. You criticise the editor for a skeptical (therefore scientific) view, while praising the editors of other journals for promoting AGW uncritically. What you&#39;re advocating is censorship. And worse, you&#39;re advocating tactics such as threats to the livelyhood of anyone opposing AGW. The Catholic Church used similar tactics in its day. What matters here is the content of the paper and its conclusions. There has been no rebuttle published in any journal, and that is supposed to be the &quot;Gold Standard&quot; for criticism. </p>

<p>The paper is a statistical analysis of data collected by those associated with climate science. Like the othe people you mention he did not collect data, he only analysed it. You use the term &quot;discredited&quot; to describe this work as well as that of McKitrick and others. Let&#39;s be clear here; the work of thoe people has never been discredited. Their work has been criticised for its conclusions by the AGW community, but nothing can be said about lack of quality in their analysis. The Montford citation is contained in the article Introduction and only refers to his summary article:</p>

<ul>
<li>This evidence spurred a worldwide dispute on both the validity of the empirical evidence and on its causes. By consequence, the purported dramatic rise of recent temperatures and the associated anthropogenic origin have found advocates and skeptics still to date igniting  “hockey-stick curve” controversy (Montford, 2010). </li>
</ul>

<p>All of the others you mentioned are also only cited in the introduction for their work:</p>

<ul>
<li>Criticism of the anthropogenic origins of global warming includes studies questioning the methods utilized for temperature reconstructions
(Baliunas and Soon, 2003; McKitrick, 2006; McIntyre and McKitrik, (2006, 2009), and other studies pointing to the prevalence of long-run
natural causes such as solar activity (Abdussamatov, 2004; Alanko-Huotari, 2006; Fouka et al., 2006), cosmic rays (Shaviv, 2005;
Svensmark and Frijs-Christensen, 2007; Bard and Frank, 2006; Usoskin et al., 2004a, 2004b, 2006), ocean currents (Gray et al., 1997; Trouet et al., 2009), and volcanic activity (Shindell et al., 2004).</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, your criticism has no validity. </p>

<p>Eugene R. Wahl is associated with the NOAA Paleoclimatology Program of the National Climatic Data Center, while Caspar Ammann is associated with the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Both organizations have a pro-AGW mandate. Both of these men are cited in various pro-AGW papers. Their&#39;s is not an independant study, but another example of pal-review in AGW. </p>

<p>What you&#39;re doing in supporting the work by Mann is rejecting natural climate cycles. And you&#39;re contradicting yourself. On the one hand you accept that CO2 increases during interglacial periods as a result of sequestration during the glacial period and subsequent outgassing. Yet you reject on the other hand that CO2 can be sequestered during cool periods withind the interglacials. </p>

<p>Yes, the anthropogenic portion of CO2 can be identified. Industrial CO2 is only a small portion of the total we now see. Industry accunts for only 2% (30gT annually) above natural CO2 outgassing (600 - 700 gT annually). AGW promoters argue (somehow) that only the naturally produced CO2 is taken up in the carbon cycle. <a href="http://www.friendsofscience.org/assets/files/documents/CO2%20Gas%20Analysis-Ernst-Georg%20Beck.pdf">Direct chemical analysis</a> shows high CO2 variability over the last 200 years and this backs what I mentioned in my last comment that climate and feedback mechanisms are dynamic over short periods. So we see that natural outgassing and uptake of CO2 are ongoing. As temperature rises so does the output of CO2 due to outgassing. To deny that is to deny one of the dire warnings issued by the AGW community (google CO2 outgassing). So, we would have to assume that atmospheric CO2 climbed during the MWP and declined during the LIA, such that the high CO2 levels associated with naturally rising temperatures of the MWP were then sequestered through the carbon cycle during the LIA. If you reject that then you have to reject either the current concern over accelerated outgassing due to warming, or natural climate cycles. You&#39;ve chosen the latter and ignored the former.</p>

<p>The first graphs you linked to can&#39;t possibly be correct due to what you said earlier; that CO2 has to increase during interglacials. Your second ink is the same as I supplied you in my last comment, showing both the MWP and LIA, and more, that the high temperaure found for the MWP was 0.6C higher than the current reference period of 1880-1960. Compare this to the <em>total</em> rise over the current warming period of 1880-present of 0.6C and we can only conclude that at its height the MWP was warmer than today. Further, the paper shows an LIA that is 1.0C lower than the reference period, making the LIA even cooler when compared to today. </p>

<p>Your third link also confirms that CO2 levels fluctuate with temperature. Your fourth link is also one that I supplied to you earlier and which also confirms CO2 variability.   </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to pass this off as frustration, just as is your linking to papers that support my position. I want you to re-read what you wrote above. The only possible way that you can justify your claim of illogic is to assume that the LIA did not in fact come to an end. But then again, you&#39;ve taken the position that natural climate cycles are myth, even though you&#39;ve linked to papers that confirm them. You&#39;re all over the map on this issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A scam? That would suggest a deliberate effort to mislead, to lie. In effect you’re talking about a conspiracy. I ask, where do you get the information to back such a claim because I am amazed that so many intelligent and well educated people representi­­­ng so many reputable scientific institutio­­­ns including EVERY single national scientific academy in the world can get it so wrong and fail to realize that the planet is not heating up and we have nothing to worry about. That would also include NASA, NOAA, the American Geophysica­­­l Union, and the American Associatio­­­n for the Advancemen­­­t of Science. Why would they do such a thing? I suppose all of these brilliant people are manipulati­­­ng the government­­­s of the world as part of a centralizi­­­ng one world/libe­­ral/soci­­a­ist/Ma­r­xi­st (mix or match them) plan to transfer wealth to the developing world and put money into the pockets of the wind turbine industry. And all of them are on board? Pretty scary stuff this! I can just see it now…Obama and Ban Ki Moon meeting with Gore and Hansen deep inside the bowels of Lenin&#39;s tomb while Stephen Hawking is wheeled in by James Lovelock like a Dr. Strangelov­­­e to guide their sinister plans. Robert Ludlum couldn&#39;t have dreamed this stuff up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, climate change is a complex and very serious scientific issue and it definitely pre-dates the United Nations. In 1917 Alexander Graham Bell wrote “[The unchecked burning of fossil fuels] would have a sort of greenhouse effect”, and “The net result is the greenhouse becomes a sort of hot-house.” ( <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio.php?id_nbr=7894">http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio.php?id_nbr=7894</a> ). That was 28 years before the founding of the UN. The greenhouse gas qualities of carbon dioxide have been known for over a century and its role in the current warming of the planet has been confirmed through multiple lines of research. In 1861, John Tyndal published laboratory results identifyin­­­­­­­­­g carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas that absorbed heat rays (longwave radiation)­­­­­­­­­. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you misunderstand me. Terrorism is the excuse the AAE uses to pass draconian legislation and limits to privacy in the name of security and safety.</p>

<p>Climate Change is used by the UN delegates as the excuse for all of the talk of carbon taxes/credits/other bullshit.</p>

<p>Are they both real? Sure. Are their threats dramatically overblown via media-hype machines for other motives? You bet. </p>

<p>This does not mean they should be ignored (the less terrorism and pollution the better obviously), but a rational, calm and collected response should be utilized for both issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;You bet.&quot; Anthropogenic global warming? No way. If anything the seriousness of the threat is underplayed by the IPCC since its final reports have to be vetted and approved by the participating nations and countries as diverse as Russia, Australia and Saudi Arabia try their best to dilute the language. 
&quot;...excuse for all of the talk of carbon taxes/credits/other bullshit.&quot; No it is in fact an existential threat to human civilization. Claiming that the threat does not exist because the solutions may include carbon taxes and cap and trade which some might find bothersome makes about as much sense as someone in the late 1930&#39;s claiming that Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan weren&#39;t a threat because confronting them required a massive mobilization of manpower and industry, raising taxes and adding to the national debt. I&#39;m deeply sorry if you find the solution to the problem really sucks but if we continue on a BAU approach the costs will only become far, far more severe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is hilarious. I wondered who the &quot;top meteorologist&quot; might be so after a quick google search of using the title (Climate change...) I found out that this &quot;top meteorologist&quot; is in fact John Coleman. After a bit of research, I learned that the man holds a BA in Journalism that he earned fifty years earlier at the University of Illinois. In other words he has no university level training in any scientific discipline and he is certainly not a meteorologist. He is a weather reporter; he reads weather reports. To claim that Robert Coleman is a credible source for a complex scientific issue like climate change is absolutely preposterous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Thomas Jefferson never say to not own slaves.&quot;???
The man owned hundereds of slaves and yet he claimed that &quot;All men are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&quot; I&#39;m sorry but somehow there was a glaring lack of moral consistency in the man. But I&#39;m not trying to debate an aspect of American history. As for myself I try very hard to do my part. Upgrading and improving the insulative quality of my house has considerably reduced my use of natural gas and the electricity I use comes from a hydro electric damn. In the meantime my point stands that one needs to focus on the science and wondering about the size of Al Gore&#39;s or Bill Gates&#39; carbon footprints is completely pointless. </p>
