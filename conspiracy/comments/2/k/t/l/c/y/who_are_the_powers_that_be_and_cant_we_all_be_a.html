    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it is. Not much different than &quot;they&quot; or &quot;them&quot;. I think the problem is that there is no solid proof of who is actually in control of what. For example, I am confident the Rothschild group is a major global puppeteer, but are they directly causing police corruption? Probably not. </p>

Those out in front are uber rich families that are all related to each other. Likely for the western head are some Italian families with historical names. Their underlings are heads of banks (including Ashkenazi Jews), oil, industry and random billionaires. Most of the 300 richest families work for the same structure of control. Who their leaders, the real ones behind the curtain, are may never be publicly known. That being said is still only on our dimension of existence.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t give a shit if you don&#39;t believe the Bible, &quot;TPTB&quot; believe and it&#39;s the enemy of God that they obey, not the enemy of Allah or Buddha or Krishna, but the enemy of the God of the Bible.

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. TPTB are the forces of evil, period. It&#39;s no cop-out and there is no identifying a principle as a person. There are many involved and most evil people truly believe they are working for the greater good. They are deceived just as much as the sleeping masses.</p>

<p>The Bible knows what&#39;s up and God has protected it through the ages. There&#39;s no way such a &#39;blasphemous&#39; text toward the Pope and all the other powers in the world would survive unless God had something to do with it.</p>

<p>&quot;What do people want to know most?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, pain and dying?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Great, that&#39;s good stuff. Now what if we write a book that we say comes from our creator and gives them meaning to their lives but really we just write a bunch of rules that suit our needs and then we say that if they don&#39;t follow the rules we&#39;ll kill them and the creator will burn them eternally in an unending fiery place of torture?!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You either are granted eternal life or damnation. There is no eternal damnation, for this is eternal life and is paradoxical to the quandary. You live or you die, you don&#39;t live forever in two ways.</p>

<p>In the Bible, there are two definitions of hell. One is the grave - the state of sleep until judgment. The other is the eternal fire, burning until everything is consumed. Death results in the grave, and the judgment results in eternal life or destruction... that is, eternal destruction, the same as before you lived after death.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hellhadesafterlife.com/hell">http://www.hellhadesafterlife.com/hell</a></p>

<p>One good resource on the Biblical doctrine of hell.</p>

<p>It is wishful thinking to believe that no matter what you do, you get to live forever in either a good or bad state of being. This doesn&#39;t make sense at all with the nature of the Biblical God. You will not be tortured into eternity, you will be damned unto eternity... meaning you will not exist anymore forever. Hellfire will consume you as fuel and burn unto it&#39;s conclusion with only the righteous being safe from the flame.</p>

<p>Kid yourself all you want... But do you really think everyone lives forever? This is new age slander. If everyone lives forever no matter what then it makes no difference whether you sin or not.</p>

<p>Do you really believe the universe was created 6000 years ago my a magical mind reading energy being that lives in another dimension? And this same energy being created a human deity hybrid to save the universe by an evil magic called sin that this same trans dimensional energy being created?

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;retelling of a pagan sun-god story&quot;? Not really, junior. There is no account of Adam, Exodus and Moses, David &amp; Goliath and the other 99% of the Bible in those &quot;texts&quot;. Just because there are similarities and blatant plagiarism as to the story of Christ and the virgin birth in pagan lore does not make them the same story.</p>

<p>It takes critical thinking to believe in a higher power. Flies don&#39;t believe in God, nor does any other animal in the animal kingdom. Do you know why? Because they don&#39;t have the mental capacity for such. </p>

<p>There has never been a time where religion has not been present on Earth. Atheists are always the minority because people would rather follow those outside the insane asylum rather than those in it.</p>

<p>The fact that flies don&#39;t believe in God does not prove a deity created the universe. It&#39;s true that we are the only species on this planet able to contemplate the origin of our existence, but we are also the only species able to research that question and figure it out. </p>

<p>I know you have a strong faith and don&#39;t want to admit the flaws in your beliefs, I was raised in a religious household as well. Sometimes real courage comes from admitting what you have always believed is wrong, and changing opinions based on facts and evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Garden of Eden:
In the Persian scriptures of the Zoroastrians, the Avesta tells the story of how Ormuzd created the world and the first two humans in six days and then rested on the seventh. The names of these two human beings were Adama and Evah. These texts date back as far as the 10th century B.C.</p>

<p>There is also a lot of evidence that the Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the oldest recorded texts in human history, had an influence on the biblical creation story. The Epic of Gilgamesh tells the story of a man, Enkidu, who was created from the earth by a god. He lives amongst the animals in a natural paradise until he is tempted by a woman, Shamhat. He accepts food from this woman and is forced to leave the place where he lives after becoming aware of his own nakedness. Later in the epic, he encounters a snake which steals a plant of immortality from him. Obviously, there are a lot of parallels between this story and the Graden of Eden from the Bible.</p>

<p>Flood:
A man is warned of an imminent flood by a god and is instructed to build a large boat in order to survive. The dimensions of the boat are 120 cubits; the building materials are wood, pitch, and reeds; and there are six decks. After the flood, the boat lands on a mountaintop where the man sends out a series of birds to find dry land. He eventually lets all the people and animals free and sacrifices to the god that saved him.</p>

<p>Now although these details sound like they were taken directly from the book of Genesis, you’d find the same information in the story of Utnapishtim, found in the Epic of Gilgamesh.</p>

<p>Moses and Ten Commandments:</p>

<p>In the Bible, the Ten Commandments were given to Moses on Mount Sinai, and were written on stone tablets, allegedly by the hand of God himself. This was thought to take place around 1490 B.C. However when one examines chapter 125 of the Egyptian Book of the Dead(around 2600 B.C.), it seems he may have had a little help. The Egyptian Book of the Dead reads like the Ten Commandments written in the Negative Confession. Some examples are:</p>

<p>Book of the Dead: “I have not blasphemed.”
Exodus 20:7: “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that shall take the name of the Lord his God in vain.”</p>

<p>Book of the Dead: “I have not committed adultery, I have not lain with men.”
Exodus 20:14: “Thou shalt not commit adultery.”</p>

<p>Book of the Dead: “I have not stolen.”
Exodus 20:15: “Thou shalt not steal.”</p>

<p>There is also some similarity between the story of the Ten Commandments and the Code of Hammurapi, dated around 1772 B.C.</p>

<p>Perhaps not, but it may be able to, and is actively trying to, explain life, reality, the universe and how we came to be. If science can show how this all happened and why it happened, with verifiable evidence that doesn&#39;t need God, then that in itself will disprove the existence of God. Science does not need to set out to disprove God&#39;s existence, it will be incidental to scientific progress.  </p>

<p>Currently science cannot answer the questions as to why life began on earth or where the first single cell came from, or what happened before the big bang. But, the scientific community has revealed so much about the nature of reality and the universe, so much more than religion and the divine has.

<p>But where is the experimental evidence? None exists in the literature claiming that one species has been shown to evolve into another. Bacteria, the simplest form of independent life, are ideal for this kind of study, with generation times of 20 to 30 minutes, and populations achieved after 18 hours. But throughout 150 years of the science of bacteriology, there is no evidence that one species of bacteria has changed into another, in spite of the fact that populations have been exposed to potent chemical and physical mutagens and that, uniquely, bacteria possess extrachromosomal, transmissible plasmids. Since there is no evidence for species changes between the simplest forms of unicellular life, it is not surprising that there is no evidence for evolution from prokaryotic to eukaryotic cells, let alone throughout the whole array of higher multicellular organisms.</p>

<p>Evolution can be viewed in two basic ways. If evolution is decent with modification or change in the geneotype of a population then we must ask how this <a href="http://www.nileseldredge.com/pdf_files/Eldredge_1979_Alternative_Approaches_to_Evolutionary_Theory.pdf">occurs</a>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trust me, no evolutionary biologist out there is disputing when evolution began (over 3 billion years ago) and where (deep in the ocean), and who by (single cellular organism). </p>

<p>Even the Pope agrees with the theory of evolution and the big bang. Granted, as to who created the big bang and started evolution, sure, he would say God. But only up until science can answer those questions. </p>

<p>You admit science doesn&#39;t have an answer and you still believe it&#39;s real? Let me get this straight:  you believe evolution, even though science still hasn&#39;t come up with a convincing case based on evidence? Blind faith?</p>

<p>There is currently a convergence between computer science and biology that you ought to look into, it&#39;s fascinating stuff. Humans are literally creating life and playing God as a result. </p>

<p>I recommend watching <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xz3df2_bbc-horizon-2012-playing-god-720p_news">this</a> documentary for and introductory overview.</p>

<p>And you&#39;re right, science is not comparable to religion, but none the less it is a method of enquiry which can answer the questions that religion purports to have already answered. E.g. the nature of reality, where life came from and the universe.</p>

<p>Again, science is not based on faith or belief. Due to its bold objectives in answering the aforementioned questions, It&#39;s my view, as well as most of the scientific community&#39;s, that assuming science continues in its current trajectory, that science will one day answer these questions with observable and verifiable evidence which is repeatable by any other researcher on earth. </p>

<p>If it continues to do this, religion will, as it has been far at least the last 500 years, recede from society as science will provide the information which humans desire most. </p>

<p>Here is the key point to note, it will be incidental to greater scientific progress. Because, as you have rightly pointed out, science stays as far away from faith and belief as possible. </p>

<p>Obviously science has not provided any evidence to confirm the origins of life, but it&#39;ll continue to research this area. But nor has religion, with any proof of course.

<p>Let&#39;s take the iPhone as a current example to understand the science behind it. I take it you learned about the periodic table in school, and the iPhone just so happens to include a range of elements found on that chart. </p>

<p>&quot;<em>Inside the rocks from this mine are rare-earth minerals, crucial ingredients for iPhones, as well as wind turbines, hybrid cars, and night-vision goggles. Minerals such as neodymium are used in magnets that make speakers vibrate to create sound. Europium is a phosphor that creates a bright red on an iPhone screen. Cerium gets put into a solvent that workers use to polish devices as they move along the assembly line.&quot;</em> <a href="http://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/the-science-behind-making-an-iphone-deep-down-in-the-mines/">Source</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, but it has answered this non-exhaustive list of questions below. And if science does continue to make more enquiries, one could only imagine that science is simply going to get better at unmasking the mysteries of life and the universe. </p>

<ol>
<li>What is the universe made of? 2. What makes us human? 3. Why do we dream? 4. Why do we sleep? 5. What are humans made of? 6. How does gravity behave? 7. What makes the tides go in and out? 8. Why is the sky blue? 9. How old is Earth? 10. How do magnets work? 11. What causes a rainbow? 12. What are clouds made of? 13. Why does water evaporate at room temperature? The list is pretty much endless. </li>
</ol>

<p>Side note, imagine the possibility of discoveries scientists are going to make by conducting experiments in machines like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland. We have already discovered the Higgs Boson, the once theorised and elusive particle that gives all other particles mass. And that machine has not even been used to its fullest potential yet. Fascinating stuff. </p>

<p>I respect your opinion on that. Even if it comes off a little ignorant. </p>

<p>As noted earlier, it&#39;s one book written by man thousands of years ago and provides quite literally, zero sources for its claims. </p>

<p>But I understand that humans have historically gravitated towards it based on faith as humans back then didn&#39;t know as much about the nature of reality and life and the universe as we do now. </p>

<p>But just in proportion as this process of extermination has acted on an enormous scale, so must the number of intermediate varieties, which have formerly existed, be truly enormous. Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely-graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged against the theory. <strong>The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Edit: In addition to that, answers concerning modern developments in evolutionary theory that help to resolve such problems, you should also know that Darwin himself offered explanations to subvert such objections. In the Origin of Species, he included an entire chapter on difficulties with the theory (chapter 6). In addition, he included another chapter on the subject of your quote: the imperfection of the fossil/geological record (chapter 9). Darwin did not shy from the difficulties, and explicitly acknowledged what he thought were the strongest arguments against his reasoning and theoretical foundation. Nevertheless, the conclusion he drew was roughly the same as the one accepted today (albeit without all of the advances in genetics, etc. that have come since): that adaptations and the origin of new species are largely the result of gradual, continuous change due to natural selection.</p>

<p>Let me try and be a little more specific, remember I&#39;m not an evolutionary biologist. My background is in the social sciences unfortunately. </p>

<p><strong>The fossil record is the most obvious evidence of the organic chain of evolution</strong>. In the last 30 or so years, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics">phylogenetics</a> has also become a powerful piece of evidence. The wiki article is pretty confusing. Phylogenetics establishes evolutionary links by looking at genetic similarities between different species. It&#39;s more quantitative than comparing morphologies of different fossils. Now, we can look at the DNA of reptiles compared to humans, and say &quot;OK this genetic material clearly came from a common ancestor.&quot; It&#39;s allowed scientists to detangle strange family trees.</p>

<p>Remember, the evolution from bacteria to man didn&#39;t happen over night. It took at least 3 billion years. </p>

<p>You are getting caught up on Darwin though. Read this carefully, <strong>evolution does not depend on physical evidence of the organic chain of evolution, not with the mountain of fossil evidence.</strong> Refer to the link above. </p>

<p>It also does not depend on Darwin being right about everything. <strong>Darwin&#39;s understanding of evolution knew nothing about genes or the complex mechanisms of genetic heredity. Mendel&#39;s pea hybrid experiments were effectively lost when Darwin was writing. The very fact that Mendel&#39;s independent experiments verified Darwin&#39;s overall concepts support evolution, in particular, the idea that descent with modification leads to variation and eventually new species.</strong></p>

<p>There is simply so much for you to debunk. By all means try though, it would be groundbreaking.</p>

<p>Edit: You are free to refute all of these points. But if you don&#39;t want to because you believe they are nonsense, then do explain why they are nonsense. And the best way to do that, would be to refute them. </p>

<p>I have nothing to debunk because you have not provided any evidence which makes is even necessary. LOL. Brilliant.</p>

<p>Can you say &quot;science has no evidence of evolution&quot; for me? Be a good boy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Feel free to counter my points, and in doing so you can show me how they are nonsense. </p>

<p>Allow me to visualize this as simply as I possibly can.</p>

<p>You said:</p>

<p>&quot;Show me physical evidence of the organic chain of evolution from bacteria to man?&quot;</p>

<p>And I replied:</p>

<p>&quot;The fossil record is the most obvious evidence of the organic chain of evolution (which I have linked you to). In the last 30 or so years, phylogenetics has also become a powerful piece of evidence. The wiki article is pretty confusing. Phylogenetics establishes evolutionary links by looking at genetic similarities between different species. It&#39;s more quantitative than comparing morphologies of different fossils. Now, we can look at the DNA of reptiles compared to humans, and say &quot;OK this genetic material clearly came from a common ancestor.&quot; It&#39;s allowed scientists to detangle strange family trees.&quot;</p>

<p>Which explains your point. </p>

<p>And if you don&#39;t think it does, then do reveal why? </p>

<p>Now let me ask you a question.</p>

<p>You claim that all the mysteries of life and the universe are answered in the bible, but that bible was written by man thousands of years ago. What are the sources for the bibles claims? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You must not forget though that the discipline of evolutionary biology is not finished. Why would it be? </p>

<p>The fossil record is not complete and there are still inconsistencies to resolve. </p>

<p>But the mountain of evidence already obtained, which can be seen in books like the ones cited earlier, proves beyond a doubt the age of the earth and how life started deep in the oceans. </p>

<p>The only thing that is being disputed is exactly how evolution played out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t even stand to hold the damn book knowing what it&#39;s done to it&#39;s followers and society. No, I&#39;ve never read the whole thing and never will. I&#39;ve had society try to jam it damn my throat all my life however, so I&#39;ve got the gist of it.</p>

<p>Ever since I was a child I knew it was bullshit. When church shows came on after cartoons, my brother and I would pretend that actively listening would kill us and that the longer the show was on the more programmed and brainwashed we&#39;d become. We&#39;d slowly crawl up to the TV and change the channel while we &quot;fought&quot; against the power of the church that was trying to stop us.</p>

<p>I, like him realized that it was all garbage and was for people that needed to substitute artificial meaning into their lives. We had meaning, our parents loved us, we loved them and we had fun playing all day just being who we were, not who the church wanted us to be.</p>

<p>If you want to believe in something, what&#39;s wrong with believing in yourself? You accuse me of letting others think for me, all the while you&#39;ve done nothing but spout off fairy tales from the bible and encourage praying for salvation both of which are glowing examples of letting others think for you. </p>

<p>Whatever happened to being good for goodness sake? I don&#39;t need a book to tell me not to kill or steal, it&#39;s common sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The book didn&#39;t do anything to society, people did. &quot;Guns don&#39;t kill people, people kill people&quot;, remember?</p>

<p>Your whining because someone misused a text to fool you doesn&#39;t make the Bible wrong, it makes them wrong and makes you an idiot for believing them instead of educating yourself about what&#39;s really in the Bible.</p>

<p>If you were too gullible to believe other people&#39;s interpretations, the Bible has no fault.</p>

<p>The Bible doesn&#39;t teach you not to kill, it teaches you how to be saved after you die, being good is a consequence.</p>

<p>science stays as far away from faith and belief as possible. </p>
