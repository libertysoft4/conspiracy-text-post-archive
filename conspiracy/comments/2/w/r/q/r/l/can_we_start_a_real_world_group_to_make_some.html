    <div class="md"><p>The true problem arises in our so called freedom of speech and open media. In little over 30 years, are news outlets have been transformed into government/big business suppressed news outlets. We have no idea as civilians as what is true and what is conspired behind closed doors and conveyed to us as false positives. Who truly is ISIS? Why are we fighting the Islamic State? Why are we starving domestically but yet we can afford to put 50%+ of our national budget towards military spending? Media makes money sound like the answer when it truly is not. We are much more productive as a society but 90% of us don&#39;t see a single bit of return. We have so many wrong ideals pushed on us as a whole;consumerism, greed, money inequality, expensive education, etc. </p>

<p>Truly it begins with the twenty and thirty year olds of today. We need to voice our opinions. We need to protect our potential leaders with all of our might. We need to groom them to lead the others, the scientists, the engineers, the handimen, the farmers. Our education system is a failure in every which way. They suppress knowledge and creativity, but push college on everyone of us when we lack basic knowledge of fixing our own household items or even own damn lives. But hey there&#39;s a pill for that and its much easier to take that pill than put in the time to fix the real issue. </p>

<p>Its about the long term as my professor in college would always say. The short term is the results of yesterday, the mid term is the results of today, and long the term is the results of tomorrow. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to start a group to make some changes, it can happen, but you have to start with a set of principles outlined, how to get movements started, at what level. Bring experts into this as well. What do economists say, Phds, philosophers, anthropologists, etc, etc. Get experts from every level of reality with their take on what change needs to be in place and start formulating principles.</p>

<p>Obviously we need decentralized money (bitcoins), decentralized power/transport/, growing food in every yard (Cuba did this successfully), fuck the American delusional dream of slavery in jobs you hate and loans (house/school/car). Housing should be extremely cheap, education free books, transport decentralized electric pickups/drop offs.</p>

<p>We need to get away from the big power companies, big oil, big pharma, big Ag, big Gov.</p>

<p>Put it all together OP, you got my support to unfold this and start getting ideas into play. Once we figure things out, we&#39;ll put some vids together, get the word out</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have two philosophies about that. One is your inner world, and outer world. Outer world is comprised of the global scenario and things not in your direct control. Your inner world is mainly comprised of your internal peace of mind and the little world you make for yourself with the people close to you, i.e. your home/village/city/community etc. There will always be chaos in the outer world as not all things are in our control, so we have to accept it, but we can also change it. However, it is completely up to you how you want to design, manage, improve your inner world. A balance of both worlds is necessary to receive true happiness. Just my philosophy. Hope it makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need a leader. We need to play by the same rules as the big boys play by. We need a figure head with a lot of charisma that can appeal to the masses, then we need a committee that uses the constitution as a framework of thought. </p>

<p>People need to be working less. That should be on the top of the agenda. Teachers can only do so much, especially with the birthrate always growing exponentially. Education of the youth should come in part from family and schooling. Yet I meet people all the time that don&#39;t even know how to use a hammer or a screw driver but they can send a tweet in five seconds.</p>

<p>Regulation of the financial market should be step two on the to do list. There is no real growth due to the financial markets. For example, the collapse of the markets made how many of the rich even richer? </p>

<p>Tax the shit out of all financial market gains should be number three. </p>

<p>Changing our military ideology into that of a isolationist mentality. This would help pay off our debt and solve problems at home with security and terrorism. I&#39;m sorry we are having problems at home and we need to fix those and not that of the world Or participate in the help of domination (Israel:personal opinion).</p>

<p>Too many issues, so little attention by our so called politicians. Who should begin a group? Why not us? It requires time and networking which we do everyday virtually and in reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. Leaders are necessary, but almost always are the first real test to the groups resolve, because no one can agree on who should be a leader. I&#39;m certainly not cut out for it for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>Everything else you said sounds great. The most difficult part will be organizing and establishing and meeting clearly defined goals. I&#39;m not sure that Reddit is the best place to do this, but I&#39;m not aware of better options either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A leader will show himself when the time is right. Americans at a very young age are brainwashed with the intent of cutting their &quot;balls&quot; off. This plus the media suppressing the news events about our fellow brothers and sisters acting and protesting will be a big obstacle for us. </p>

<p>I believe it begins with education. Our youth know nothing of the world until their 19, in debt, and on their hands and knees scrubbing the floors for the rich and prosperous at a McDonald&#39;s. High school graduates are not competent enough to work. How come is this true? They don&#39;t even know about interest rates, balancing a check book, parenting, fix their own car, etc.</p>

<p>But hey you and me are talking. Imagine if our ideas reached the masses. It&#39;s all about starting the flame which I think has been started. Keep talking and it shall become relevant in our society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m definitely not saying nothing should be done and the response on this thread is actually pretty heartening, but violence will only beget more violence and I don&#39;t think any movement will survive going up forcefully against the militarised police.</p>

<p>What we seriously need to do has been suggested by other people here, create a new system between ourselves which is based on growing your food, paying with decentralised money (Bitcoin and other crypto currencies), using clean, self created energy (solar being the obvious example) and demonstrating an alternative which people can see is viable and can subscribe to. Once we detach ourselves from the need for their energy, their food or their expertise in living our lives then we take away any power they have over us and real change can begin to happen. It&#39;s just a shame that things like communes are seen as hippie bullshit, because if one was set up with modern day technology, with solar power, new farming and greenhouse techniques, craftsmen and workshops which demonstrate how to construct your own housing, furniture and other essentials for living then a real paradigm shift could occur. If we can offer a new way forward that doesn&#39;t dismiss living a normal life but takes away centralised power and promotes learning life skills then I honestly don&#39;t think violence will even come into the equation. And I&#39;m not talking about going in living as a mountain man away from civilisation, but instead focusing on creating communities made up of like minded people who can create a productive environment to live and learn in.</p>

<p>Although of course saying that events such as Waco make me question whether communities like that will ever be allowed to exist and flourish. </p>

Anyone participating in such activities would be labeled an extremist in the mainstream media. They would turn all the steeple against you and the movement would die before it even got started. Even if you did succeed you have to ask yourself: is the world this way because the people who control it are evil? Or does power just corrupt people? Sure the new system would be honest and just from the beginning, but I fear it would soon be just as corrupt in a small amount of years. I think it&#39;s just human nature. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, If you want to do something like this you will need a list of priorities or goals.</p>

<p>First of all, what is the ideal goverment/world that you want to have? I am completely sure that everyone will have diferent opinions here, so we could try to do this for each one that coments here and see differences.</p>

<p>Second, what is different from the real world? General traits mostly.</p>

<p>Next, which ways can be used to change the real world to the ideal world? 
Considering all options here, crazy as them may be. To do a bit of brainstorm about ways you could do a revolution changing the ideas of the people, maybe attacking some of the pilars of the current system so it colapses into itself like banks or politics, etc. And the way, once the last system is done, to convert the rest to the world that you want to create.</p>

<p>Basically, aplying deductive reasoning from the big idea until all the parts are defined. This includes the psychology, physics, logistics, politics and onther stuff that must be deal within the system that you want to modify (wether you want it to be USA or the whole world).</p>

<p>By the way, some here said that a revolution would be needed. If I guess that it is in the USA, you should account to 2 things if you want it done. One, if you tell someone something that goes directly against his/her beliefs, the odds are that you will get a negative response (look for the Benjamin Franklin effect, goes by this principle). 
Second, people won&#39;t start a revolution for something that isn&#39;t mortifying their daily lives. If they have anything else to entertain themselves, forget it. In any case you could appeal for the worries that they have about the goverment first, capture their attention, then go more radical?</p>

<p>I have read some post that go this way, but If you wanna do it seriously, begin with an well defined ideal idea.</p>

<p>I personally will go for this: create my own company, going for renewable resources and technology development, focusing on one fucked country to build reputation, expand into other areas to gain more monetary power, help the community of the country even more, gain citizenship and run for president, then use monetary and political power to change things like I would want (wich would be another long post) and make a precedent for others to use.
^ An one-man way to do it pacifically if succesful</p>
