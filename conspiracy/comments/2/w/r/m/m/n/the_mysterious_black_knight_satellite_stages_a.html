<blockquote>
<p>I have to admit, when many of you sent me this story, I was intrigued, because the whole subject of the Black Knight satellite is one of those stories that does not get much attention, but whose significance, if true, is baffling indeed. </p>

<p>For those who don&#39;t know this bit of contemporary mythology, a brief &quot;bring-me-up-to-speed&quot; might be in order.</p>

<p>During the 1950s, as the space race between the USSR and USA was heating up, a mythology began to appear: there was, it was alleged, an object - some versions of the story put it at an approximate weight of fifteen tons, well beyond the publicly known launch capabilities either of the Soviet Union or the United States - was in polar orbit around planet Earth. </p>

<p>This object was clearly artificial, and moreover, there were two problems: (1) fifteen tons well exceeded the launch capabilities of either the USSR (which at that time clearly led the USA in public and visible space technologies), and (2) the object was in a polar orbit, which exceeded the technological capabilities of either nation to achieve. </p>

<p>Indeed, at its first discovery, the object exceeded the launch capabilities of either nation to put into any kind of orbit, much less a polar one. </p>

<p>This, of course, presented a conundrum, for if the story was true, then this left but two real possibilities: someone else from or on Earth had launched it (leaving the questions of who, when, and how hovering disturbingly over the story), or the object was not from Earth at all. </p>

<p>Either way, one had a &quot;hidden player&quot; on the space scene. Dubbed &quot;The Black Knight&quot; satellite, the story became part of the fringe lore of the space age, informing to some extent the science fiction work of well-known and engaging sci-fi author Philip K. Dick.  </p>

<p>Then the story more or less faded, kept alive on the edges of the science fiction and space-age &quot;alternative research&quot; communities, but by and large forgotten even to many of them.</p>

<p>Until now, when, curiously, the story has made something of a come-back, prompting once again the question &quot;why now&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As this article makes clear, there is a mystery here, and it won&#39;t go away:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;In 1899, Nikola Tesla picked up unusual signals from an unknown source on his high-voltage receiver in Colorado Springs which he speculated were “intelligently controlled signals” that originated “from another world.” Astronomers have reported picking up similar radio signals since the 1930s and Dr. Lincoln La Paz of the University of New Mexico sighted the possible source in Earth orbit in1953. </p>

<p>&quot;The U.S. Department of Defense commissioned astronomer Clyde Tombaugh to look for it. A famous article about the Black Knight was published in both the St. Louis Dispatch and The San Francisco Examiner on May 14th 1954. At that time, there were no man-made objects in Earth orbit…that we know of.</p>

<p>&quot;That changed in 1957 when the USSR launched Sputnik 1. It was reported that an object believed to be the Black Knight Satellite was “shadowing” Sputnik 1. When Sputnik 2 was launched a month later, Dr. Luis Corralos of the Communications Ministry in Venezuela photographed it again shadowing the satellite. </p>

<p>&quot;In 1960, a Grumman Aircraft Corporation tracking camera took a picture of it but the company kept its findings secret. In 1963, U.S. astronaut Gordon Cooper reported seeing a UFO like the Black Knight in front of his capsule. A photo taken during a space shuttle mission in 1998 (seen in the videos) shows an object many believe is the Black Knight and a 2014 video feed from the ISS shows a similar object.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And there&#39;s more curiosity about the object, including its strange association to sci-fi author Philip K. Dick:</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://mysteriousuniverse.org/2014/02/the-black-knight-satellite-bracewell-probes-and-phillip-k-dick/">The Black Knight Satellite, Bracewell Probes, and Philip K. Dick</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>As the second article makes even more clear, there was an abundance of strange stuff associated with the satellite:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;On September 3, 1960, a camera at the Grumman Aircraft Corp. Long Island factory managed to capture an image of the object.  It was said to be a redish-pink glowing object moving in an east-to-west orbit, which is, apparently, the opposite of most other man-made satellites, and which doesn’t fit the polar orbit reported by Time.  </p>

<p>&quot;Subsequent to this, astronaut Gordon Cooper Jr. allegedly caught a first-hand glimpse of the object during his 22-orbit Mercury-Atlas 9 flight, which was the final of the Mercury Program missions. Cooper claimed that it was an object much larger than any other man-made satellite of the time, and that it glowed a neon green.</p>

<p>&quot;Cooper, who passed away in 2004, had long been sympathetic to the UFOlogy movement and had been vocal about not only the reality of extraterrestrial life, but also the idea that the US government had been and continues to be complicit in a cover-up of contact with such.</p>

<p>&quot;Then in 1998, during NASA mission STS-88 to the ISS, flown by the Space Shuttle Endeavour, images were captured of an unidentified object in orbit; an object that a great many people believe is the ever elusive Black Knight satellite.</p>

<p>&quot;Following Time’s publication, John Keel detailed the discovery in his book Disneyland of the Gods (1988), wherein he noted that around the same time that Dark Fence detected this mysterious object, ground based HAM operators were reporting having received strange radio signals.  </p>

<p>&quot;According to Keel, one such HAM operator received and decoded a signal and claimed that the message corresponded to a star chart, plotted from Earth 13,000 years ago, and focused on a star system called Epsilon Boötis…and this is where things get really interesting.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is to be noted here is that both Venezuelan and American scientists (and one can only presume, the Russians as well), took photographs of the satellite, which are to this day been kept secret, or at least, never surfaced.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s more, and it&#39;s here our own high octane speculations enter the picture. Consider the end of the second article:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Here’s the thing about all of this. The above may seem like a lot of conjecture and supposition, and perhaps some of it is – surely it’s a stretch to say that Philip K. Dick was a harbinger of tidings from an alien species using a Bracewell probe – but many of the facts are confirmed.  </p>

<p>&quot;Black Knight does seem to exist, and while noting that certain governments do have a penchant for secret technology and clandestine operations, its origin and purpose seems to defy explanation.  </p>

<p>&quot;If we are able to accept the stories and theories held therein, and the, at times tenuous, connections between them, can we accept that there’s a 13,000 year old alien probe orbiting our planet, sending literary inspiration to select people via the gold necklaces of attractive delivery people?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s two assumptions here that deserve attention, the first being that the Black Knight satellite - if real - has been around for 13,000 years, and that it is &quot;from elsewhere,&quot; and the second is the implicit assumption that it&#39;s still up there. </p>

<p>And underlying this, another story: why the attention back on to this bit of Cold War space mythology now, and precisely during a period over the last two months that have seen such strange space news stories? In other words, why is the Black Knight back now?</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the American Space shuttle had payload to polar orbit launch capacity of about 14 tons, and payload recovery capability of about 16 tons. In other words, depending on the physical volume of the Black Knight satellite, it is conceivable that the object might have been recovered and returned to Earth during one of the classified missions of the shuttle. </p>

<p>This, of course, raises the stakes about the story considerably, for if this be the case, then rest assured that satellite - if indeed it ever existed (and I am inclined to believe it did) - then its origins are now probably well known, and whatever secrets it may have held might be unravelling, at least in secret.</p>

<p>So why is the Black Knight back now? I strongly suspect that it&#39;s back because it forms a part of whatever strategy the powers that be might be concocting concerning the dreaded &quot;D&quot; word: &quot;disclosure.&quot; </p>

<p>Here, permit me to remain skeptical, for the powers-that-be are well-known to be consummate liars, and whatever information they might disclose concerning this mysterious object - if they disclose at all - will have to be subject to the procedures of verification, including independent verification of its actual physical composition. </p>

<p>And the real question hovering over the story is, of course, why it is back now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before I knew about this topic I ate a massive dose of fresh mushrooms years ago and was telepathically &quot;attacked&quot; by this object. It acted as if it was the creator of the cosmos, it stated many scientific and technological things that were beyond my comprehension. It also had other entities that would chime in borg like supporting the statements of this self claimed &quot;god&quot;. This thing I could only &quot;see&quot; in my minds eye and had totally forgotten about this image of the ship until I saw these Black knight photos. I&#39;m not sure what this thing was it seemed artificial or very alien like. It was the most egoic evil thing I&#39;ve ever had the displeasure of interacting with. To add to this not being entirely in my head or a hallucination, my cat who has never before nor since was going apeshit at my second story bedroom window at the same time this object came closer. I know most will scoff at my story but it was true and was my experience. I&#39;ve been using psychedelics for decades and know the difference between hallucinations and telepathic communication regardless of what others may say. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>google &quot;Dr. Richard Sauder, what is the machine&quot;(don&#39;t be off-put by the pictures of him with the indian-hat / symbolic outfit thing in one of the google images of him), he&#39;s a guy with a PhD who had basically the exact same experience that you did, only it was on ayahuasca and he was &quot;shown&quot; basically the same thing you just described - &quot;the most evil, egoic thing you&#39;ve ever had the displeasure of interacting with&quot;, I would have written off your story as &quot;interesting but whatever he was on mushrooms&quot; if I hadn&#39;t already been familiar with it through this guy.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a very serious kind of guy with a doctorate in serious subjects(like geology and some other thing) and he&#39;s been doing research into the US military and other organizations who have been building deep underground and undersea facilities, and he ended up going down to South America and taking ayahuasca and being shown something he refers to as &quot;the machine&quot; or something &quot;like a machine consciousness&quot; which is basically trying to take over the world and basically has the world in it&#39;s clutches and is basically trying to co-opt and take over all of life in the universe, according to &#39;ayahusca&#39;.</p>

<p>He tells the story in much more detailed and descriptive language in his own words on radio interviews. Like I said, he&#39;s a very serious guy, so he gives a very serious description. It matches what you say you were &#39;shown&#39; on mushrooms basically <em>exactly</em>. I would be interested if you went and listened to his story and responded to me about what you think about it and how your vision of this compares to what he says .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This terrible egoistic entity is you. It&#39;s consuming you at all times, as it consumes us all. When we strip away the defences using these hallucinogens and psychedelics we&#39;re laid bare to its ravenous appetite, and it appears as a separate, alien thing. </p>

<p>I believe this solar system has and is being used as a communications relay, centred on the planet Saturn. Our friend Mr. Icke kind of has it half-right, but again that pesky ego tells him the transmissions coming from Saturn are designed to limit our perceptions of world and Self.</p>

<p>This is incorrect.</p>

<p>Saturn&#39;s relay capability has existed separate from anything remotely to do with Earth and its mediocre cargo of diminishing animals and other life-forms. Earth may have once been vaguely useful as a source of gold and other materials, but those who seek to study life on other planets have MUCH bigger fish to fry than Homo sapiens sapiens. </p>

<p>Saturn&#39;s relay is a &quot;set it and forget it&quot; automated system, maintained by smallish biological robots we know as the Greys. Unbeknownst to those who initially installed the relay and the robots, the Greys began to obsess over the Earth and in particular the humans on it. As we&#39;ve heard many times, they&#39;re fascinated by our ability to experience emotion, as they cannot. </p>

<p>The relay (transmitter/receiver dish, whatever) around Saturn is being manufactured by large electromagnetic objects that process dark matter into plasma. This material &quot;feeds&quot; the newer, smaller objects, enabling them to &quot;grow&quot; to fantastic size and power. Some of the largest ringmakers are over 30,000 miles long. </p>

<p>There are now rings appearing on other planets. This is a symptom of a busy cosmos! Just as the owners of a large radio antenna may rent out space to different telecommunications companies, so are the owners of Saturn&#39;s relay expanding their enterprise and providing more and better signals for civilizations wishing to bridge the gulf at this locus on one of the Milky Way&#39;s spiral arms. Think of it as a bridge, or a tunnel. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve said too much. The Black Knight is neither here nor there, when it comes to the presence of alien civilizations close to Earth. There are bigger fish to fry, as I say. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would have agreed with you but my ego had already been stripped away by an ayahuasca/pharmahuasca experience months before and did all my ego work previous to this experience. </p>

<p>This was a separate entity, this thing and I were communicating in extremely high frequencies that were metallic in nature it wanted my submission and it was external. We switched to this higher frequency after about 2 hours of English based communication, on dmt and other meditative methods thoughts just easily transfer telepathically this was not the natural method I&#39;ve used before with positive entities this was A HIGHLY TECHNOLOGICAL entity that hated every human on this planet this thing was extremely evil and could not ever in an eternity be able to be corrected.</p>

<p>This was a 4 hour battle that left me exhausted, I was so freaking scared during it I woke my wife to escort me to use the restroom as this thing was the absolute opposite of love it was pure hatred. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kind of reminds me of a reoccurring dream I had as a toddler and a few times offer the years till I was a teen, each time was slightly different but thematically the same.</p>

<p>I would be floating in complete blackness unsure of where I ended and the darkness began. Then I noticed them. Two things I can only describe as circles or rings. The first so large it defied imagination it emitted a painfully deep sound that reverberated everywhere. This thing and it&#39;s sound was a strange red/green unlike any color I have ever seen. This ring did not care about my existence even though it could extinguish me with a slight change in its tone. The second was so small that it was smaller than a point. It too gave of a sound but one so high pitched it hurt, and its color was beyond red/blue again another color I have never seen since. This second ring was in a dance with the first, trying to negate its waves, often successfully, but where the first ring did not care about me this second one had so much hatred and anger toward everything that I felt and knew it would destroy me just because I existed. Each time I saw these two rings a third entity found me at first it seemed completely shocked I was there and each time told me I did not belong there as I was not strong enough yet to resist the two rings tearing me apart. Each time it shielded me from notice and sent me back. The final time I was there, the fourth or fifth it seemed. Both of the rings noticed me right away and the little one started to try and destroy me the larger one began to move to protect me but it began ripping me apart on accident. My protector suddenly shielded me but seemed older and somewhat broken. It forcefully sent me back and told me I could never come back now that they had noticed me.</p>

<p>It was always the most terrifying dream and experience I have ever had. First time telling this experience but that small ring felt indescribably evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The Devil does not exist. It is a false name invented by the Black Brothers to imply a Unity in their ignorant muddle of dispersions. A devil who had unity would be a God</p>

<p>&quot;The Devil&quot; is, historically, the God of any people that one personally dislikes. This has led to so much confusion of thought that THE BEAST 666 has preferred to let names stand as they are, and to proclaim simply that AIWAZ --- the solar-phallic-hermetic &quot;Lucifer&quot; is His own Holy Guardian Angel, and &quot;The Devil&quot; SATAN or HADIT of our particular unit of the Starry Universe. This serpent, SATAN, is not the enemy of Man, but He who made Gods of our race, knowing Good and Evil; He bade &quot;Know Thyself!&quot; and taught Initiation. He is &quot;the Devil&quot; of the Book of Thoth, and His emblem is BAPHOMET, the Androgyne who is the hieroglyph of arcane perfection. The number of His Atu is XV, which is Yod He, the Monogram of the Eternal, the Father one with the Mother, the Virgin Seed one with all-containing Space. He is therefore Life, and Love. But moreover his letter is Ayin, the Eye; he is Light, and his Zodiacal image is Capricornus, that leaping goat whose attribute is Liberty. (Note that the &quot;Jehovah&quot; of the Hebrews is etymologically connected with these. The classical example of such antinomy, one which has led to such disastrous misunderstandings, is that between NU and HAD, North and South, Jesus and John. The subject is too abstruse and complicated to be discussed in detail here. The student should consult the writings of Sir R. Payne Knight, General Forlong, Gerald Massey, Fabre d&#39;Olivet; etc. etc., for the data on which these considerations are ultimately based.)</p>

<p>It was said by the Sorcerer of the Jura that in order to invoke the Devil it is only 
necessary to call him with your whole will. </p>

<p>This is an universal magical truth, and applies to every other being as much as to 
the Devil. For the whole will of every man is in reality the whole will of the 
Universe. </p>

<p>It is, however, always easy to call up the demons, for they are always calling you; 
and you have only to step down to their level {193} and fraternize with them. They 
will tear you in pieces at their leisure. Not at once; they will wait until you have 
wholly broken the link between you and your Holy Guardian Angel before they 
pounce, lest at the last moment you escape. </p>

<p>Anthony of Padua and (in our own times) &quot;Macgregor&quot; Mathers are examples of 
such victims. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, every magician must firmly extend his empire to the depth of hell. 
&quot;My adepts stand upright, their heads above the heavens, their feet below the 
hells.&quot;</p>

<p>Liber XC, verse 40. See The Equinox.</p>

<p>This is the reason why the magician who performs the Operation of the &quot;Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage&quot;, immediately after attaining to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, must evoke the Four Great Princes of the Evil of the World.</p>

<p>&quot;Obedience and faith to Him that liveth and triumpheth, that reigneth above you in your palaces as the Balance of Righteousness and Truth&quot; is your duty to your Holy Guardian Angel, and the duty of the demon world to you.</p>

<p>These powers of &quot;evil&quot; nature are wild beasts; they must be tamed, trained to the saddle and the bridle; they will bear you well. There is nothing useless in the Universe: do not wrap up your Talent in a napkin, because it is only &quot;dirty money&quot;!</p>

<p>With regard to Pacts, they are rarely lawful. There should be no bargain struck. Magick is not a trade, and no hucksters need apply. Master everything, but give generously to your servants, once they have unconditionally submitted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This &quot;being&quot; is an ahrimanic being. Not Ahriman himself but an ahrimanic being. Ahriman wants to enslave the world and replace warm human love with cold calculating machines...exactly like the film the terminator except without the time travel or ability to change the past...and the kill crazy robots are less dramatic but will encircle the earth blotting out the sun and creating a web of spider like robots that surround the earth. The only way we can put a stop to it is if we are to stop being so overly materialistic and start developing our souls and spirits. And don&#39;t get me wrong, we need a firm control on our materialism, we just need to stop focusing solely on materialistic achievements and develop our spiritual selves. I wish this weren&#39;t true but the future is dim if we don&#39;t stop the cult of materialism from taking over.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to discount and say drugs but I was not altered in my consciousness at all I didn&#39;t see anything that wasn&#39;t there I saw more than you can imagine and more than words can convey. Be a man and do the dose I did and come back here and tell me it was just drugs or a hallucination. YouTube has near death experiences all over it and was almost the exact same experience I had. I had to let youfuckingslaves &quot;die&quot; before I was able to crossover. DMT isn&#39;t like LSD or ANYTHING ELSE it takes a brave soul to traverse the spiritual world it was the most difficult yet revealing experience of my life. I highly recommend everyone do it although one should be heavily prepared. You really do access universal mind. To label it &quot;drugs&quot; is like saying wet when describing the ocean while technically correct it&#39;s a far cry from the magnificent ocean. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that&#39;s not accurate either. The history of mysticism testifies to that. </p>

<p>One can come to know such states, and even be established into a stable stage of identity in such understanding and insight, through religion and &quot;following&quot; the Manifestations (of God) who herald religion (who, in the terms I currently understand these kinds of matters through, are the first derivative emanation of the Divine, they are the first soul appearing repeatedly in a human form, the rest of us as souls embodied are always &#39;after&#39; them in some sense. They are the Deathless being, the Godhead embodied, they are the representation and sign of the archetype of our Self. In an unclear way, they are our very Selves. So the relationship then is one of acknowledging that hierarchy and union. It&#39;s bigger than oneself, even though it is ones very Self. And whatever we experience as individual human beings, whatever possible state of realisation we can attain to, is in some way derivative to the kind of consciousness they embody. Even as we experience and re-cognise our &#39;I&#39; as <em>I AM</em> as a &#39;first&#39; in our personal experience it is still &#39;ever after&#39; whatever consciousness field they embodied and established within/through God). </p>

<p>None of that devalues or dismisses your experience. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just pointing out how that is cast in relation to religion as I understand it, which is a <em>relative</em> truth, and the relative necessity of relationship through that, which illuminates and establishes &#39;following&#39; someone (but not just any someone, the archetypal someone) who stands at the center of what <em>Is</em> and transmits what becomes religion in form, in regards to how you are measuring that, or understanding that, relative to your ownexperience.</p>

<p>There are many ways up the same mountain. </p>

<p>To find a &#39;way&#39; and insight via that way doesn&#39;t grant a right nor necessarily understanding that can dismiss other ways in a generalised sweep, particularly those traditions delivered from the Supernal Supernatural, the Ineffable Itself, that very same God (which is so immense and unfathomable that It embraces us, not the other way around) you claim you found identity with and understanding through. </p>

<p>Again that doesn&#39;t dismiss your experience or understanding. I take you at your word and believe you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think you could just do what you claim if you were sober? I don&#39;t discount your experience, but I wonder why many claim that certain hullucingins such as this get them to a closer understanding.</p>

<p>I myself have had an out of body experience while sober. I was limited on range for some reason. Now years before this I had taken drugs but didn&#39;t do it for an awaking. I did it cause MDMA made me feel really fucking good.</p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t into weed much makes me twitch. Plus it made me feel as if I wasn&#39;t in control of my thought process. Not my favorite thing if that makes sence. </p>

<p>Shrooms I couldn&#39;t stand the taste so I did pure psylocibin instead. Was much more palatable. Way stronger as well. DMT I did before it became schedule one and you could order it online. It didn&#39;t do anything to me. Perhaps because I didn&#39;t do enough. I can&#39;t remember how or how much I took. Was a long time ago I have slept since then.</p>

<p>Did ketamine once and only once. That shit is no good for people. Also did Zoloft once cause I could. Wow that is the weirdest damn drug. It makes you just not care. There is no other feelings associated with it. Just clean slate and no giva fuck.</p>

<p>Meth was a drug of choice for a while. We all know what it does. Never used a needle just smoked it. I wasn&#39;t able to handle the drip feeling or taste. </p>

<p>Had LSD a few times. Was on sugar cubes the first two times. That first time wow my joints hurt the day after. Like I was an old man. Second time was way better didn&#39;t feel it coming or anything. Was actually slipped to me and I made the best of it. Actually got visuals off that one. </p>

<p>Last few times was blotter and it stayed with me for what felt like a week. Off and on just fried out of my goddamn mind. Really not a good decision. </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t do cocaine or heroin to my knowledge. Although I am sure it was cut into the extacy I did there for a while. Also never used a needle. </p>

<p>One day I just grew out of it and haven&#39;t touched it since. Except weed because I find it harmless. I also support its medicinal and textile future but don&#39;t feel it should just be used to get fucked up. Society tends to go to excess with things like that. I see it ending badly. I have been wrong before and am ready to be wrong about this as well. </p>

<p>In also feel weed is being legalized now for votes. I mean who votes as a majority anymore? Old people. And old people do that because they feel they have a say. Most the younger generation knows what we want don&#39;t matter for a fuck. So we just don&#39;t. Weed being legalized is an attempt to gain favoritism in our generation.</p>

<p>Anyways that&#39;s me. </p>

Yes i know there&#39;s the stories about thumbprints, BUT a weeklong egoloss of course also yields false memories.
That is not to say that L is in any way worse or something - it&#39;s just that dmt is sth. completely different and one knly realizes that after having a breakthrough (which can also be an alien abduction!).</p>

<p>Why are you talking about RCs as if they were in any way lighter or something?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello.  This is a throwaway comment, please approve.</p>

<p>Your experience sounds a lot like my first time on mushrooms.  They were a friend&#39;s homegrown and turned out a lot stronger than expected.  I had a very similar moment where I thought we were all gods.  After that moment, I realized we are all independent beings, capable of being our own gods and controlling our own destinies.  I also &quot;understood&quot; the concept of infinity.  It was a really eye-opening experience.</p>

<p>I think at that point, I simultaneously rejected both religion and government as legitimate powers.  Religion was easy - I was already very familiar with atheism, and believed what atheists said, however I truly &quot;took ownership&quot; of my soul and my destiny in that moment.  Government is a tool that can make a lot of aspects of society very convenient, however the hubris that governments have historically used to control others is not a legitimate source of power.  We are all in control of our own destinies, deep down, and anyone who tries to infringe on that is a bad person.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I also experienced ego-death, where I felt like my own concept of my body and my being was foreign.  I felt like a floating head, moving around, with a question mark over me.</p>

<p>I also fully believe you when you say you can properly delineate between hallucinations, even while tripping.  I have never seen something that wasn&#39;t there on mushrooms.  A lot of stereotypes will have you believe that you see little men that don&#39;t exist, or that animals suddenly being speaking, which is not the case at all.  The hallucinations I have (and am fully cognizant of them being hallucinations) are always visual patterns.  For instance - when I close my eyes I see spiraling fractals, or see fractal patterns laid over top natural things (trees, grass, etc.), or see henna-type patterns on the ceiling.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry you had a bad encounter with whatever that was.  It&#39;s hard to really describe some things like that, or truly know what they are.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve tripped a few times, but nothing has been quite like that first one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah righteo, you obviously haven&#39;t taken enough to be so quick to discount people&#39;s experiences. Think about it, if there are aliens out there, why bother going to the effort of interacting in person. Just dial into the matrix and connect to another open consciousness. Kind of like BBSs in the old days...Have had similar experience. Asked entity how world ended. Received vision along the lines of &#39;you don&#39;t really want to know, but it ends with a boom&#39;. Sobered me right up at the time. Does anyone else get the blue-tinged X-ray vision thing where you can see through your arms and trees etc?</p>

Everyone thinks that everything has to have some sort of rational materialistic explanation...even if it extends to alien races or ancient high technology. Spiritually speaking <em>scientific</em> and <em>egoistic</em> &quot;claims&quot; are ahrimanic.

    <div class="md"><p>What the hell are you talking about?  HAM radio is nothing more complicated than AM or other radio technologies, and if it came here 13,000 years ago, who is to say what the creators anticipated we would develop in that time frame.  HAM is just a set of frequencies set aside for amateur use that uses either FM, CW, or SSB transmission.  If this is SSB or CW, which has a better range than FM, it would make perfect sense that they would use that!  Especially if they were using the shortwave band which can travel half way around the earth and would likely be the first frequencies used in development of wireless transmission.</p>
