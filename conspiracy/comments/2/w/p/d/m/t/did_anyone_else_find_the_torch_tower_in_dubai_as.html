    <div class="md"><p>Some high school physics and some chemistry, with an engineering 101 could tell you that. </p>

<p>Its either a huge design oversight to build a building that has so many critical members that is one fails due to heat expansion entire building collapses, or its a propaganda coverup. Either way Iraq war is unjustified, amrican continued conflicts all around the world are unjustified. A nation byilt on war needs it to servive. Whats a greater catalyst than a national tragedy. </p>

<p>In this day and age of information manipulation and censorship noone can know enough to make a judgment call on whats actually happening around them, let alone it be the actual truth. I think because religion has been so heavily apart of america the whole belief through faith is heavily embedded into the culture. With the many wars and patriotic thinking, its easy for the common man armed with the information he is given to trust the goverment and believe its motives a d actions are just, are for the people. Information age people, the weapon for the masses. 
To top it all off, heated relations with russia is a huge modern day battle. US cant and wont go toe to toe against another huge military force. So it picks off the developing middle east to fuel its war built nation. With russia it has and is playing a political, economical manipulation game. </p>

<p>But thats just what I think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To any one who believes the official &quot;theory&quot; on the events of that day, please read the following:</p>

<p>And keep in mind the events of 9/11 started the hell in other countries that have taken the lives of approx. 1 million of their people and effected the lives of those many times that over.</p>

<p>I truely envy your position on the issue. I wish I could share your sentiment, however my intellect prevents me from forming my beliefs on political opinion over science.</p>

<p>The true bull shit is the theory that the 9/11 commission report put out. Or what the mainstream media would like you to believe. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXlC2TlNgEUYouTube">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXlC2TlNgEUYouTube</a></p>

<p>Everyone is like the believer of the &quot;official theory&quot; in one respect, no one wanted to believe that the official theory is a farce, and had distain for people saying otherwise, but the similarites end there. Intelligence and respect for science prevented them keeping that belief.</p>

<p>Anyone who feels the need to insult people for haveing the courage to accept a very ugly truth, in no way changes the facts or their opinions, and does nothing but make you appear ignorant, and trollish.</p>

<p>Im sure many do appreciate the entertainment value when encountering some one like you, (I know I do) and you should have your own page here, but <a href="/r/comedy">/r/comedy</a> is already taken. Maybe if you can figure out an appropriate name for this picture <a href="http://imgur.com/27AW9s6">http://imgur.com/27AW9s6</a> you can create it. I will be the first to sign up. Like many of the ones who take this subject serious, we always need break.</p>

<p>Also, your ignorence gives you the appearence of haveing the mental capacity of a court jester, so why not exploit your talents? Can you juggle too? If not, you might want to pick up that skill, for future vocational opportunities.</p>

<p>Based on your views, that might be a wishful thinking on my part and assumptive that you can actually learn anything. Or take any moral responsibility for the actions of our goverment in the wake of 9/11. Sorry to set the bar that high for you. No one expects you to learn. Or believe anything you dont want to. Despite the science staring you in the eye.</p>

<p>Next time we will just offer you a treat if you can sit or stay. We&#39;ll start there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually a very effective tactic.  It scrambles reasonable argument with negative ideas -- I don&#39;t know if it counts as a form of hypnosis, but whoever came up with it is fucking brilliant.</p>

<p>And evil.</p>

<p>A variant of that tactic is to lure someone into an argument, and pace the argument such that they get a personal jab in just before the &quot;continue this thread&quot; arrow.  I assume they&#39;ve studied the matter and have concluded that most people won&#39;t follow the arrow -- and that personal attacks are effective in shaping a thread.</p>

<p>Yet another variant is to use massive walls of text to confuse readers.  In this variant, they hop around from subject to subject in the walls of text -- thus scrambling the thoughts of even the most persistent and interested reader.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all very fascinating, really.</p>

<p>And evil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Evil is exactely what were up against.  Its the evil of the all mighty dollar.  They will trigger wars, fund both sides, sell guns to both sides, then laugh as the peoples slaughter each other, for their profit. </p>

<p>It doesnt matter who wins to them, for the fact the war happened makes them the winner.  They fund both sides so they come out on top either way.  </p>

<p>Most sane people cant comprehend how someone can go to those extreme means for a profit, most people are good by nature.  Until we get as sick and twisted as those who do, ie start taking out the people behind the shit instead of picking out sides in a war, the wars will continue, mankind will suffer, and our deaths will be for the amusement and profit of the powers that be.</p>

I was directing that at the people who believe  the &quot;official theory&quot; or those that actually believe the 9/11 commission report.  Obviously they dont have the courage to believe the ugly truth the events of 9/11 present.  I do support what you say.  The poor attempt of insulting someone, was directed at the ones who dont, and believe the second greatest set of lies forced on the american people.  The bull shit with JFK would be the first.

<p>How about Wikipedia? Please show me ANY pic of damage to that building that could cause a symmetrical collapse at free fall speed?</p>

<p>Please explain how isolated superficial damage could cause this. I&#39;d love to hear how you think that&#39;s possible because it isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Also what am I basing my claim on? Actually it is based on simple math that is taught in Grade 10. I am not even going to tell you that you couldn&#39;t comprehend it. The point is - there is a reason you won&#39;t entertain the notion. That part is clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So lets say WTC 7 was indeed damaged from the towers collapsing, and the fire that broke out was a result of the damage. Why did it fall like a controlled demolition at free fall speed from a fire? Ok let&#39;s say a massive piece of debris hit a corner of WTC 7, or the side, causing it to buckle under the weight. Why would it fall evenly, and parallel to the ground? Every support beam was severed with even distribution throughout the building. That fall is not natural, especially not so for a fire. There&#39;s your explanation as to how it doesn&#39;t add up</p>

<p>EDIT: I figured I&#39;d return with some proof. Windsor Building in Madrid, Spain in February 2005. It had much more intense fire and lasted for <em>20 hours</em>. Part of the building actually <em>did</em> collapse, in line with the laws of physics. The whole bloody thing didn&#39;t just sink into itself at free fall speed and evenly.</p>

<p>Why would you even attempt to mention that if you KNEW that the bullshit computer models produced by NIST are not verifiable by any outside party.</p>

<p>You really think that anything that can&#39;t be substantiated should be trusted with such vigour the way you do?</p>

<p>Now I ask you....  Back up your dubious claim that asymmetrical damage is capable of producing a symmetrical collapse. Really?</p>

<p>I can make this easy for you. Just give me one time in history (other than Building 7) that this has ever occurred. I think it is you who isn&#39;t taking this debate seriously ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s a good point, but still I find it interesting and think my point stands. No matter the materials, the torch tower was engulfed (in segments) and seemed to gut the interior of those rooms. To suggest WTC 7 fell from fire that was not really seen from the exterior means that it had to be burning far hotter than the torch tower, all internally without even seeing it from outside. Basically lava would need to be poured into the main beams to support this view. I&#39;m no architect and not pretending to be an expert here, but if anything this just confirms my view of that fall or demolition </p>
