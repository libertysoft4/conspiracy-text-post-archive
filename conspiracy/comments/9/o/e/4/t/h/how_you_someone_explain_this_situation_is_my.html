<p>But about 2 weeks ago, i was at a supermarket with my girlfriend and i told her (in voice, in person, not texting) how i ate one of those ben and jerry ice creams for the first time and i found them really nice. Suddenly 2 days after, i start getting ads about them in my instagram feed.</p>

<p>I thought meh, coicidence.</p>

<p>Today i was at a second hand store and found myself a columbia jacket. I sent a couple of pictures of it to my mum and told her about it, etc. (throught texting in whatsapp)</p>

<p>5 hours later, i get columbia ads in my instagram feed. Bear in mind, i had never gotten such ads about these brands before i accordinly mentioned them irl.
What do you make of this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An unfortunate truth is that your cellphone may know you better than most people in your network. </p>

<p>Everything a cellphone takes in, whether its by typing into it, speaking near it or having the camera exposed is being collected and stored away. All that data gets horded somewhere. Big companies pay for that data to be able to push targeted marketing to you, this is the most benign way your personal data can get used. The more intrusive and alarming reason your data can get used is to target and harass you, for a multitude of reasons.   </p>

<p>A comment made previously is that they&#39;re trying to read your mind, not only are they trying to do that, but also trying to make predictions based of your behavior that&#39;s collected by your phone. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Imagine the profile somebody could draw up on an individual by merely analyzing their; text messages, frequented locations, bio metrics, speech recognition pattern, etc.<br/>
A phone can literally <em>know</em> you and is an extension of your consciousness by proxy of usage.   </p>

<p>This is why privacy is important. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Phone chips are powerful enough nowadays to do image recognition onboard. What was once heavy AI and server side only is light work for the latest phone chips. Not only do those apps have access to your photos but they know already what’s in them. </p>

<p>On top of that I am sure that whenever you use Instagram, whatsapp, any of the Facebook apps it’s sending camera and microphone data back to Facebook. Even when you’re not using the camera in the app. It’s not sending images or a video stream, but keywords of things that are recognised by the AI chip in your phone. </p>

<p>For a bonus. I have a theory that when you’re browsing Instagram it’s tracking your pupils to see what part of the image you’re looking at as to identify without “likes” what’s is interesting to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this isn&#39;t new. they have been doing this for 10-15 years. It&#39;s only now with the more powerful cellphones that they can now record your voice, listen for trigger words (columbia, ben and jerrys, etc.) and key off of them. Also on all pictures it will run them against known items to see if they can find one on there. Also, with geo fencing on the newer cell phones they can detect what isle you are in at Walmart and see how long it takes you to travel down that isle. They can tell where you stop and for how long. Also if you stop for more than a few seconds they figure you&#39;re looking at an item. They just shoot a picture and see which one. It gets far far creepier the more you go down the rabbit hole. I used to work for Walmart and it&#39;s a horror what they can tell from you just entering. Also, paying with cash doesn&#39;t do anything anymore because your cell phone tells the cops that you were there. Sorry, TV shows. </p>

But this time, i just found it really odd.

    <div class="md"><p>Many people on here are aware of how much your data/information is collected and used, but for those not well versed let me share an example with you:
A sex toy was on the market that could be controlled with an app. That sex toy company then used the phone mics to record audio data of the sexual experiences, for whatever reason (selling data, analyzing data for R&amp;D). </p>

<p>If something you use connects to the internet, just assume it&#39;s being used for data collection.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not here to say data and data analytics is inherently bad, as it can be a powerful tool used when used ethically, just that people need to be aware of how data is used in the modern world.</p>

They listen to you all the time and send your recording back to their servers for parsing.   That&#39;s what allows them to respond when needed, but it also means they have a lot of other unrelated text parsed from your conversations which they can then sell to marking firms for money.</p>
