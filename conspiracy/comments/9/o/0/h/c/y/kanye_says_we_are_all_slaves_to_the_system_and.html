    <div class="md"><p>I see. People do have a way of belittling each other when they don&#39;t agree with something. When  Colin Kaepernick  took a knee for injustice and freedom and was ridiculed by the media and white people, but when Kanye uses the same right the same people the were fighting with Colin for freedom of speech is fighting against Kanye for him trying to use his freedom of speech along with the Media. The media is playing both sides and creating a race war. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the media is trying to discredit him based on bipolar more than anything else. The thing is a person can have bipolar disorder and all it means is how they present to the rest of us is different.  (Rapid gear shift through topics, big ego, etc). It does not negate their thought process as a whole.</p>

<p>Kanye is doing something we rarely see in public figures - he&#39;s dropped the mask and letting us see exactly what he thinks and feels. He&#39;s living his mental health journey in front of all of us. As he said himself on Kimmel, a PR nightmare. That said, this is the single most destigmatizing act a public figure could do. (Not intentional - he is going through a playbook painfully common for people with bipolar. My dad was also reluctant to take meds. They experience the mania as creative energy go go GO!  It took my dad time to get on board with taking meds, to acclimate to them,  and to realize his creativity was never a product of the mania itself.  Kim is a freaking superwoman. This is very difficult to live with but worth it in the end.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I love this guy. I love how sincere he is. How human he is. We live in such a superficial,  carefully edited and Photoshopped world that seeing him talk is refreshing. </p>

<p>Kaepernick was not ridiculed by all white people. I&#39;m white and an Army brat and firmly in the take a knee court. :)  I feel he won with his Nike deal. The media definitely sucks and certainly tried to pretend people burned product over it when in fact they did not and Nike&#39;s stock just went up - the best measure of how the public feels is always in the financials.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not simply him having an opinion that&#39;s leading me to say he&#39;s having a manic episode - it&#39;s the way he&#39;s coming to that opinion and the way he&#39;s expressing it, paired with the rest of his erratic behavior especially in the last few weeks since he&#39;s had to cancel his tour. Oh and the fact that he was in fact diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Saying you&#39;re just exhausted and don&#39;t need your meds is not the same as being misdiagnosed. It&#39;s the actions of an individual who feels more creative, powerful, and &quot;firing on all cylinders&quot; because of the mania, which in the grips of an episode doesn&#39;t feel like a problem to the person experiencing it, but that doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t having a manic episode. Me thinks the only reason you don&#39;t see a problem with the way he&#39;s been acting is because you agree with him so you&#39;re looking past his obvious issues. It&#39;s scummy and exploitative to be using someone who clearly needs compassion and actual help to score political points. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m bipolar fyi and all he said was don&#39;t let society make your decisions for you which I 100% agree with yes and why is there a standard on how we should say things. That is programming within itself. How can you not have a problem with someone expressing their opinion, but have a problem with the way they express it. He didn&#39;t say anything threatening  and he didn&#39;t physically hurt anyone. Also he is under contract which is why  I believe he is saying things the way he&#39;s been saying it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So medical observations are not adequate to use to justify saying someone is suffering from a mental illness? Jesus dude, are you even reading what you&#39;re writing? He&#39;s acting exactly like I did when I suffered a manic episode, that&#39;s enough reasoning (paired with his previous bipolar diagnosis and his stating he&#39;s stopped taking his meds) for me to think he&#39;s mentally ill. It has very little with what his &quot;opinions&quot; are and is more about the way he&#39;s been acting for the last several years. These most recent outbursts are just the latest in a long line of erratic, manic behaviors. </p>

There was nothing unstable about him wanting to bring his shoe factory to Chicago or bring white and black people closer together. He has don&#39;t a lot of crazy things, but nothing we as people not in the spotlight haven&#39;t done already. People start off with views they later grow out off.

    <div class="md"><p>Open your eyes. He was using Kanye to appeal to black people because the only positive media coverage he gets is on Fox News and other right-wing media. If he actually cared about fixing the issues facing the black community instead of just a photo-op, he would have invited actual community leaders, activists, and those already working on fixing the problems. Instead he invited two black celebrity supporters of his to have an ineffectual converastion because he knew inviting Kanye would instantly create drama. Also his points about those views (slavery and the 13th) didn&#39;t make any sense and were the exact opposite of what he wound up shouting out into the world. Dude is clearly confused as fuck about what he&#39;s actually trying to say when he has to continuously come out with press releases to explain his off-the-cuff inananity. Like jesus christ, you want to talk so much about being an independent thinker, programming, and mind control but you&#39;re just supporting a different system. Wake the fuck up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Slavery was a choice is actually a common sentiment echoed throughout history that all Americans grew up hearing, in different words: &quot;Give me liberty or give me death.&quot;  Kanye is just saying it in a more jarring way, and that&#39;s actually intentional and calculated.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The 13th Amendment statement he clarified even better- during his conference with Trump. Clarified what he meant, but perhaps not in the most clear way. During his monologue,  he referred to the 13th amendment as having a trap door. This was following his points about prison reform and the dude he wants to get freed who is currently locked up. Kanye doesn&#39;t want slavery to be legal. He wants the amendment changed because it actually legalizes slavery via the prison industrial complex. The 13th amendment specifically and implicitly suggests a prison-slave system. He points out the irony in that, when the 13th amendment was ratified, it was illegal for blacks to read. They were freed from slavery, but if they were to read the document that freed them, it would get them arrested- allowing them to be re-enslaved via the prison systems. THAT is the trap door he was referring to. That is what he wants changed.</p>

<p>TBH, Kanye is trying to solidify his place in history. I do believe that- like Trump- it is purely ego-driven. But whether that is the case or its actual altruism... if Kanye accomplishes Kanye&#39;s stated mission goal of prison reform... he WILL be an American hero. As far as I&#39;m concerned, for the black community he would be on a whole other level above MLK, motives notwithstanding. And the impact would be equally positive for all races.</p>

He&#39;s half-expressing thoughts before immediately jumping to the next topic, often saying the exact opposite of what he clearly means. Stuff like tweeting to &quot;Abolish the 13th Amendment&quot; is the exact opposite of what he was trying to get across. Some people do have very energetic and creative personalities, but some people also actually have bipolar disorder - which Kanye has admitted to being diagnosed with in the past. He was already an energetic and creative person while he was on his meds, now that he&#39;s stopped taking them he&#39;s acting erratically because he got called out for being out of touch with the average black person in America and now he&#39;s spinning out trying to prove he&#39;s &quot;woke&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree with his means, I think it was a silly way of protest, but I find it far more disrespectful to this country to disregard the freedom this country is supposed to represent, in favor of the symbol of the freedom.

I&#39;d much rather live in a country that people have the right to protest in silly (even disrespectful) ways, than forsake freedom so that my feelings are never hurt.

    <div class="md"><p>Assuming this is actually happening I’d say it’s meant to happen gradually and not necessarily to result in some huge race war but to simply divide people and make it easier to control the masses.</p>

<p>Just look at the left/right divide, people don’t listen to the other side anymore and lots of people are digging deep into their side and getting more extreme. There’s no war happening but there’s also no productive political discourse, it’s like we’re being distracted and divided and not accomplishing anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I enjoy listening to his thought process. It seems that he wants to disentangle himself from the opinions of the public &amp; be free to express what he thinks &amp; feels without being put down for it. I would think everyone would support him in this. </p>

<p>But alas, there is a group of people in our country who seem to think unless you agree with them in every single point, your viewpoint is a disgrace. So therefore, they will degrade you, call you names, try to disgrace you &amp; otherwise punish you in whatever way they can think of.</p>

<p>This recent rant on CNN is a case in point. They went way over the top to disgrace Kanye as much as possible. He didn&#39;t deserve that at all. What has he ever done to them ?? Nothing. They disgraced him because they were told to do so by the Deep State as damage control to keep more blacks from leaving the Dem. Party. That&#39;s the bottom line. Damage control.</p>

<p>They know Kanye is very influencial &amp; many of his followers may be affected by what he says &amp; does. Its getting closer &amp; closer to voting time. They need every vote they can get -- even though this type of hatred &amp; punishment is exactly why many have already left the Dem.party. #WalkAway. </p>

<p>I support Kanye in his quest to be honest with himself &amp; his fans. He deserves to be able to make his own decisions &amp; not be persecuted for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve never been a Kanye fan, but I actually am concerned with his mental health, especially since he has announced he went off his meds. My father had MD too, and I see so much of my dad when he was off his meds in these recent Kanye videos. I know what my father suffered, and how it affected everyone in our family. I don’t see this behavior was being laudatory or worthy of condemnation, because I really don’t care what any celebrity has to say about politics. I just hope he’s able to get it sorted out because MD can end in really tragic ways and i wouldn’t want his children to go through what I did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m having trouble parsing this question, but if I’m understand your correctly: yes and no. Not everyone who believes in mind control is mentally ill, not everyone who has delusions of grandeur/infallibility or narcissism is mentally ill, BUT paranoia, narcissism, and delusions of grandeur can absolutely be symptoms of mental illness, and are DEFINITELY symptoms of MD. The way he has been speaking the past couple weeks, the rambling, the jumping topics, the difficultly of following the natural course of a conversation (thinking of the TMZ interview here), the temper, the frustration, those are things my father would do when he was having a manic episode. </p>

<p>The mania sucks for everyone around you when you have MD and can be dangerous if you also engage in risky behavior, but  the depressive swings that are the real danger to the person suffering from the illness. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, that&#39;s the ignorant part. One one hand, it ignores all of the runaway slaves and slave revolts, the fact that people did escape and that many died trying. But those individual actions did nothing to undermine slavery as an institution, and not every person was in a situation where they could escape. Which is why it&#39;s also ignorant on the other hand, because it ignores the way in which every facet of antebellum society was structured around protecting the institution of slavery and preventing people from escaping: families were forcibly separated, enslaved people were denied basic educational skills like reading, writing, and arithmetic, minor infractions were punished with brutal violence, people were employed as slave catchers, there were laws that made it illegal to help people escape, etc. No one person was alive for all 400 years, people were born into this system designed to oppress, exploit, and physically traumatize them. Many died at young ages, having been worked to death without even knowing how to spell their own names. To claim that that was <em>a choice</em> is <em>so</em> ignorant it boggles the mind. </p>

<p>You say other people say that, but do you know who those other people are? Neo-confederates, the KKK, Southern Agrarian apologists. We <em>should</em> be offended when people try to rewrite history, because they&#39;re trying to deny reality for their own politically motivated ends. And since it&#39;s probably safe to assume that Kanye is neither a neo-confederate or a KKK member, we have to ask why he is denying reality. I do not believe it&#39;s because he&#39;s uneducated: I do not believe its because he doesn&#39;t know history. And such a claim does serve his own beliefs that he and he alone can see truth, that he and he alone can overcome manipulation, that he and he alone can liberate himself from society. That is the <em>classic</em> cognitive pattern of someone suffering from mania. </p>

<p>These claims are not grounded in reality. Therefore we have to ask: are they grounded in political propaganda or in a distorted cognitive pattern that denies reality? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the mind control is best related by anology. Imagine if you kidnapped a baby. Now in the long run you intent to use this person as a slave. So as this child grows up you fill their head with all types of nonsense so that the entire scope of their existance is a narritive that you have spun. The advantage of this is that you can instill a very personally limiting belief structure inside that person. This person &quot;knows&quot; and believes only what you have told them about themselves and without the cognitive function or the insight to take the inward journey toward truth they fall in line right in the nitch that you give them as another cog in the machine. And this scenario has played out in every culture that has been colonized by Rome, Britain, Spain ect... The timeline is so long as the suppression of information so great that we all seem to forget that it was never like this originally and you believe a complete fiction.</p>

It’s much easier for someone to go “oh let’s check out this train wreck” when they don’t have to buy a physical copy. It helps Kanye’s case that, in general, while a lot of people might not like him personally, his general standing in regards to the artistic output he produces is still relatively high. </p>

<p>All he has to do is offer up his services to regular people for free.</p>

<p>He will destroy the system, by offering what is a high valued source for a much lower price. everyone else who would do the same would then have to lower their prices to compete. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kanye has a belief system. Belief systems always distort direct, pure perception of the present moment.</p>

<p>I was born into the USA sixty years ago. When I got here, already built by men and women before me were roads, bridges, electricity, schools, hospitals, stores, ways to distribute water, food, and supplies throughout the country, developed technology, stores, and a constitution that restricted government from impinging on certain freedoms of the people. This was all presented to me at birth. Given to me by the creativity, action, and sweat of those who came before me.</p>

<p>In the present, I enjoy the technology of computers and the internet. None of which I envisioned, created, or worked hard to create. My contributions to the wealth of my country has been works of art, teaching children how to create, and writings. I&#39;ve had to make money to survive, like everyone for thousands of years has had to do. Trade and monetary systems comes with all civilizations. The idea of someone getting a free ride is pretty much universally distasteful. Everyone should contribute to one&#39;s family.</p>

<p>Am I a slave? No. If I were to call myself one, it would be an insult to all real slaves that have come before or that exist now. I received a good education from a public school, after which I could choose the direction of my life. I&#39;ve had to pay my dues in certain mediums---that&#39;s part of life. Not everyone is a success over night. My life has been my creation within the infrastructure of a society built long before I was born and that continues to be built. By free people. Doesn&#39;t mean these free people don&#39;t have to work to survive. Even the squirrels in my back yard work all day to survive. It&#39;s part of life. </p>

<p>Am I under mind control? No. Also part of human life is the exchange of ideas, ideology and belief systems. People always seem to be telling stories and trying to get others to believe what they believe. An awake person sees this and also his or her own belief systems. What happens to a mind that can examine its own contents? Belief systems aren&#39;t inherently bad or good. They&#39;re just a series of thoughts that we connect and hold as truth, regardless of what present reality is or has become, or is changing into. We use them to separate ourselves from our experience, or the contents of experience. I believe I&#39;m liberal and that you are conservative, now we&#39;re separate in my mind. But reality is actually undifferentiated and interconnected, even though we remain individuals.</p>

<p>If you believe it, then it must be true is one of the most held beliefs. If I believe the world is ruled by a secret cabal of trillionaires, then it must be true. If I believe that people go to heaven or hell, then it must be true. If I believe I am a slave to the system and under mind control, then it must be true. And I will see the world through the lens of these beliefs.</p>

<p>But here I am. My partner sits in her chair watching a Spanish language channel trying to learn Spanish on technology given to the world by very intelligent, creative people. Technology neither of us could build at this moment. We sit in a home we worked hard for. It wasn&#39;t given to us. We didn&#39;t build it. I don&#39;t know how to build one. I&#39;m not hungry. I type on this amazing creation called a laptop that let&#39;s me use my freedom of speech to communicate with people all over the country and world. I see squirrels playing in the yard. The sky is overcast. My knee hurts. I&#39;m not separate from any of it. My experience and I are one.</p>

<p>I&#39;m extremely grateful for this life--most of which has been given to me by others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The world as we know it today was also constructed by people who have gone counter-culture. In fact, the world was likely <em>most</em> influenced by those who have gone against the grain as that&#39;s the best way to bring about change.</p>

<p>You, and me, can enjoy the materialistic side of life, but what&#39;s being controlled, and what the conversation is about, is the culture. We do not have a big say in our culture, therefore our thoughts, in a sense, are controlled by what year it is and what country you&#39;re in. There are many examples of how our culture has been &quot;steered&quot; in a certain direction in order to fulfill a goal which was not our own and which we had no say over.</p>

<p>Computers are great. What&#39;s not great? Censorship. Clickbait articles. Conflicting news. Pay walls. </p>

<p>Television is great. What&#39;s not great? Commercials. Sensationalist media. Left/right narratives in movies and shows. </p>

<p>Science is great. What&#39;s not great? Nuclear bombs. Surveillance technology. Weaponized viruses.</p>

<p>The problem isn&#39;t that these things exist, but rather <em>how</em> they&#39;re utilized after they are created. I don&#39;t think anyone is saying that work is bad, though everything is getting more expensive. Or that having an abundance of food is bad, though its a lot of unhealthy junk covered in pesticides. Or that mass media is bad, though its being used as propaganda to get us to vote a certain way.</p>

<p>Kanye is extremely wealthy and likely being used as some sort of pawn so this example is not necessarily a good one, but closing the blinds does not making the outside world disappear.</p>

A lot of people don&#39;t like the idea of drug use and may feel uncomfortable in a room with someone using drugs or talking about drug use. They may even have negative opinions or comments towards that person for doing so, however when they hear in on the radio they don&#39;t have the same opinion as they did the person in the room and will pay money to see these people perform on stage high on the same drugs they don&#39;t want to see there friends and family doing. Now they are promoting what they are against... So why is there a standard to the way things. I don&#39;t understand how people agree and disagree at the same time.</p>

<p>He says &quot;Think for yourself&quot; but he says that in reference to the democratic party trying to trick people, he&#39;s not bringing up the republican&#39;s manipulations. It&#39;s purposely divisive because he knows the audience he&#39;s trying to reach.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It started when he exposed radio during his concert. They pulled him off stage and the next time he was seen he had blond hair and was getting off the elevator with Trump. I do feel like he is forced to move this agenda, but trying to tell people not to listen to him at the same time if that makes sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m having trouble parsing this question, but if I’m understand your correctly: yes and no. Not everyone who believes in mind control is mentally ill, not everyone who has delusions of grandeur/infallibility or narcissism is mentally ill, BUT paranoia, narcissism, and delusions of grandeur can absolutely be symptoms of mental illness, and are DEFINITELY symptoms of MD. The way he has been speaking the past couple weeks, the rambling, the jumping topics, the difficultly of following the natural course of a conversation (thinking of the TMZ interview here), the temper, the frustration, those are things my father would do when he was having a manic episode. </p>

<p>The mania sucks for everyone around you when you have MD and can be dangerous if you also engage in risky behavior, but  the depressive swings that are the real danger to the person suffering from the illness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you&#39;re constantly having to make a press release to explain the halfcocked ideas you&#39;re espousing then you&#39;re actually not making a lot of sense. He&#39;s half-expressing thoughts before immediately jumping to the next topic, often saying the exact opposite of what he clearly means. Stuff like tweeting to &quot;Abolish the 13th Amendment&quot; is the exact opposite of what he was trying to get across. Some people do have very energetic and creative personalities, but some people also actually have bipolar disorder - which Kanye has admitted to being diagnosed with in the past. He was already an energetic and creative person while he was on his meds, now that he&#39;s stopped taking them he&#39;s acting erratically because he got called out for being out of touch with the average black person in America and now he&#39;s spinning out trying to prove he&#39;s &quot;woke&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The meaning, and intent behind his words is important. I think his &quot;Think for yourself&quot; message is tainted with the context of his support of Donald Trump, and how he brings up the democrats as being conspirators. I think this taint is intentional because I think he is a willful (or perhaps unwilling) agent of the particular political spectrum that Donald Trump is apart of.</p>

<p>He says &quot;Think for yourself&quot; but he says that in reference to the democratic party trying to trick people, he&#39;s not bringing up the republican&#39;s manipulations. It&#39;s purposely divisive because he knows the audience he&#39;s trying to reach.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And he has yet to say something that makes it as though he is too unstable to have a public opinion. There was nothing unstable about him wanting to bring his shoe factory to Chicago or bring white and black people closer together. He has don&#39;t a lot of crazy things, but nothing we as people not in the spotlight haven&#39;t done already. People start off with views they later grow out off. Just because he felt one way 7 years ago doesn&#39;t mean he still has to be THAT person. </p>
