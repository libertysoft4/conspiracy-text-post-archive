        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In gaming NPC stands for Non-Player Character. Usually when approached an NPC will have a set number of responses that depending on the questions and answers can be uniform to various other NPC&#39;s within the game. There is little difference between a person plugged into the matrix of the modern world and an NPC. The masses are mostly Non-Player Character&#39;s, they aren&#39;t really playing the game they are on autopilot, they are just following their programming. Have you ever tried to explain the world to a friend and their eyes glaze over? Have you ever heard someone say, &quot;I just don&#39;t like to think about that stuff,&quot; or have you ever been called a downer for talking about war, about corruption, about child sacrifice? &quot;That stuff is a bummer to think about.&quot; This is the programming stepping in to protect itself. Cellphones, meta reality like pokemon go, and constant propaganda shut down the natural processes of a human brain. Logic and reason cannot function once cognitive dissonance takes hold. A person will feel physical pain when their programming is questioned. Nietzsche said that the masses are a herd that desire subjugation from above, Lenin went mad when he came to the same conclusion. Apparently slogans were not enough to free the minds of the masses. Totalitarian ideologies in the guise of populism will take advantage of the herd mentality of the masses in order to push their unnatural agenda&#39;s. &quot;Parliamentarism, that is to say, public permission to choose between five main political opinions, insinuates itself into the favour of the numerous class who would like to appear independent and individual, and like to fight for their opinions. After all, however, it is a matter of indifference whether one opinion is imposed upon the herd, or five opinions are permitted to it. But he who diverges from the five public opinions and stands apart, has always the whole herd against him.&quot; (Neizsche the Gay Science, 174.) If you have the whole herd of NPC&#39;s against you you might be onto something. </p>

<p>Their impotent rage and mindless, lemming-like recitation of empty talking points have been so expertly captured in the NPC meme, which I see the wicked self-hating limp losers blowing their tops over. Truly a huge victory for our movement, but, even more important, a colossal loss on the propaganda front for the already mostly-defeated zombie ghosts of limp-dicked ineffectiveness that is the radical left and their brainwashed minions of a dying ideology. </p>

In fact, I read the Right&#39;s information regularly to understand what they are being fed to best combat their misinformation campaigns. In my experience, I understand their positions as well as they do, I simply disagree with them.

    <div class="md"><p>NPC is a label that attempts to make out other human beings aren’t really real people, it’s at once an arrogant and totally insecure worldview in which you have to work hard to convince yourself you’re superior. The worst thing about it is the people that use it are themselves guilty of what they say of ‘NPCs’ - mindlessly following a narrative within a cognitive box that’s been constructed for them by someone else, allowing themselves to be driven to scorn and hate of the so-called ‘other side’ all in service to those who seek to divide and conquer. We’re all human beings, were all being screwed over, we’re all subject to manipulation, we all need to work together. The direction these people are going in, I’m not sure if they see where it leads but they need to stop and take stock of what they’re actually doing and what their core values are, independent of anything or anyone else, and then ask themselves how they can practically apply those values to the world, and whether what they support is actually, factually, objectively delivering on those values. I’d wager most honest, humble and self aware people would recognise that they’re straying further and further from what they want to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get this perspective but it seems to me like a lot of people promoting this npc meme are completely caught up in this political theater. 
A lot of the comments here indicate that &quot;npc&#39;s&quot; are all on the left which comes off as lazy groupthink to me. I&#39;ve known conservatives and liberals who are excellent critical thinkers. 
I get the idea that a lot of people would rather have others think for them makes sense but dehumanizing everyone who disagrees with you seems pointlessly divisive  to me  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s simply that the left, in general, is a very diverse group of people with a lot of different ideas. Of course there are &quot;NPC&quot; types on both sides, but it&#39;s a fact that the right is made of mostly the same types of people. White, rural, older, less education - not all, of course, but primarily. So, if one were to suggest either side full of &quot;NPC&quot; then I think this is misattributed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and it’s really sad how so many have been completely had hook line and sinker by this propaganda just because it came from ‘the internet’. They hooked them in with a few good nuggets of truth about corruption and hypocrisy among the status quo elites and convinced all these people they were the savior, when in truth they just want to take over and be corrupt and hypocritical same as ever. It’s just now they’ve got this following that will refuse to believe anything bad, they are psychologically blind to the faults and corruption and dishonesty of Trump. I get why people fell for it because they had a great story and everyone was looking for a savior. But fucking awful people knew that, and have taken advantage of it in the worst way possible. We now have so called conspiracy theorists cheering on a guy who helped write the Patriot act and another corrupt elitist billionaire who is totally in the palm of Israel’s hand. It’s crazy.

    <div class="md"><p>Great post.  NPCs (socialist dems) are like teenage kids who want to be cool.  They share talking points to be relevant and to not seem uncool to the popular bullies.  The best is catching a group of NPCs (dem socialist) having conversation.  They literally sit around and see who can be the most liberal.  This behavior explodes on social media.  That is why this NPC meme theme is hilarious in its accuracy.</p>

I’ve already seen people use the NPC thing as an apparent excuse to kill/blow up/get rid of people they think disagree with them politically or people who don’t believe in this or that theory, usually the Trump believers who ironically are behaving as you describe above. Dangerous road towards evil with this one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know, it’s awful, makes me feel nauseous every time someone uses this characterisation. As we’re on a conspiracy sub, I wouldn’t be surprised if this meme was a way of gearing sections of the population up to enact violence on their fellow citizens as part of some kind of martial law mixed with vigilante ‘justice.’ I can imagine the military using this tactic when they try to turn soldiers into killing machines- those ragheads, they’re not human, they’re vermin etc! But instead it’ll be those liberals/leftists/centrist/moderates or whatever, they’re not real humans, they’re NPCs! Killing them will be no different to just shooting a few virtual characters in a video game! No more immoral than deleting some lines of code! Etc etc. And these people think they’re somehow above all that propaganda and brainwashing stuff!</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m not literally saying that. I&#39;ve noticed that NPCs love the inappropriate use of the term &quot;literally.&quot;</p>

<p>Many people are humans who have been brainwashed and programmed, are incapable of critical thought, and need to be told what to believe by the media/government.</p>

<p>The germans called it propaganda, Freud called it hypnosis, his nephew called it public relations,  but it is a state where through imagination alone you can fully believe total falsehoods and biased minds will not see through and question.</p>
