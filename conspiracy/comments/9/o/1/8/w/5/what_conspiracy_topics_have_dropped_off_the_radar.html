        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With Trump, you have a lot of the right-leaning conspiracy theorists hailing him as a savior, and a rising legion of left-leaning conspiracy theorists who finally seem to be getting a whiff of the rot in the state of Denmark (yet in a very focused way, as if Trump and his cronies are the only one with the stench on them.)</p>

<p>My question is about what &quot;conspiracy&quot; related topics no longer get as much play since Trump has been elected. Politics and even conspiracy theory circles are becoming increasingly polarized, and with that polarization comes a highlighting of some topics and a back-burnering of others. </p>

<p>One that appears somewhat glaring at this point would be monetary policy. Personally, I hear far less discussion of the Fed, central banking, IMF, etc. than I did three years ago. This might be due to the channels of information I subscribe to, but I expect unless you actively follow this type of information, you aren&#39;t seeing it either. </p>

<p>Notice he never said how it was rigged or who was doing the rigging. Clearly they didn&#39;t do a very good job of it since he managed to win an election rigged against him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He did though. Funny thing was he specifically said the left are colluding with Russia and he left called those claims outlandish and impossible and he was ridiculed for saying it and literally overnight the left went from &quot;impossible for Russians to be involved&quot; to &quot;OMG IT WAS THE RUSSIANS&quot; and the whole world noticed except for the American left. I can&#39;t trust Trump but I have been a supporter but the idiocy of the left is what gave Trump his popularity worldwide. You might think people forget but we don&#39;t, we remember every little lie and every bullshit story that was told during the elections. Both sides were at it but it&#39;s the left that have this playground tactic of &quot;I know you are but what am I?&quot; Style arguments and it&#39;s always the left that turn what they are being accused of into their own accusation. Also the left absolutely love to take obvious satire and take it seriously in an attempt to discredit Trump supporters. These actions to anyone on the fence are pushing people away from the left because it&#39;s transparent as fuck. Maybe if the left spent more time working on policies and less time one smear campaigns you&#39;d have a leftist president right now but they were too busy throwing insults and accusations that they lost the war. I think that&#39;s what hurts the left the most, the fact they did this to themselves and it&#39;s why they are hysterical now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, he never thought he was going to win. I mean he did specify who the left were colluding with to rig the elections and he always said Russia then the left went from &quot;russian collusion is impossible&quot; to &quot;it&#39;s definitely the Russians&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh right, I see what you mean now. So how is &quot;colluding with Russia&quot; the same thing as rigging the elections?</p>

<p>I suppose what I&#39;m asking in a single sentence is: in what sense were these elections rigged according to Trump before the polling day?</p>

<p>A vague &quot;colluding with Russia&quot; doesn&#39;t mean much. They were colluding with Russia to try to win the election? Maybe with bots commenting online or what have you? Not the same as rigging it. Rigging an election means fixing the outcome.</p>

<p>So, since Trump claimed the election was rigged against him, and then went on to win, clearly the election was <em>not</em> rigged. Or any attempt to rig it failed to work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well being as the left claim Trump is in power due to colluding with Russia we should ask them how they achieved this. </p>

<p>As you say, rigging an election means fixing the outcome which can be achieved a number of ways (see brexit where the public were manipulated by the media into voting out) the largest smear campaign ever launched against any man would probably help with that, the problem was everyone saw the lie and voted accordingly.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean, political campaigning, no matter how dishonest, is not election rigging.</p>

<p>I dunno how it relates to these vague claims Russia was involved somehow somewhere &quot;they leaked the emails&quot; or whatever. None of that is election fixing.</p>

<p>I would go as far to say the election wasn&#39;t fixed and Trump was getting a pre-emptive &quot;I lost because the powers that be wouldn&#39;t let me win and fixed it&quot; because he expected to lose. Trump had no evidence the election was fixed, because it wasn&#39;t, he was making shit up. That is why it is so funny going back to my original comment, because then he went and won!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you talking about? I never said Trump colluded with Russia. I struggle to see how Russia were involved at all. YOU are the one who brought up Russia.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying, very simply: </p>

<p>Trump started talking about voter fraud and saying he thinks the election is rigged, in the run up to election day.</p>

<p>Then he actually won the election, meaning it wasn&#39;t rigged and everything he&#39;d been saying was clearly not true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But what you are saying is grossly oversimplified. &quot;Trump won and this proves it wasn&#39;t rigged&quot; is straight up silly and I won&#39;t be dragged down by this low energy thinking. If you continue down that path I&#39;ll just stop responding because it&#39;s typical Reddit fodder crap.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the left constantly barking russian collusion which is apparently ok, but once trump throws it back it&#39;s suddenly ridiculous? That makes no sense. Just because it didn&#39;t work doesn&#39;t mean there wasn&#39;t an attempt but I shouldn&#39;t need to say that because that in itself is obvious to anyone who actually matters.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, it certainly proves that the outcome wasn&#39;t fixed. Could there have been some electoral fraud, against Trump, and Trump won anyway because that electoral fraud wasn&#39;t enough to tip it in HRCs favour? Yeah, I&#39;d concede that point as something that is at least possible. Shame I had to make the point for you though.</p>

<p>Speaking of fixed elections and Russia, Russia actually do have fixed elections. The latest presedential election in Russia went like this:</p>

<p>Main real opponent: Alexei Navalny, convicted of a crime and not allowed to run.
Other opponents: Selected by the Kremlin to give the appearance of opposition, fakes.
Russian media: Under the control of the Kremlin, they fabricate the narrative that a democratic election is taking place.</p>

<p>That&#39;s funny too, because Putin is really popular in Russia and would win the election anyway!</p>

<p>False. On a few levels. The question was </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Will you accept the <em>results</em> of the election?</p>

<p>And he said:</p>

<p>I think Q is Trump or at least someone with direct access to Trump and what is dangerous about this is Q and Trump are the polar opposite of this sub and any conspiracy theorist for that matter and if you don&#39;t know why that is then welcome because you are new here. It can&#39;t be debunked because Q is legit, as in Q is someone close to Trump. </p>

<p>Someone close to Trump. If you have any sense whatsoever alarm bells are ringing right now, what could the American government (whose reputation is nothing but nepotism and greed) stand to gain from &quot;leaking&quot; classified information to the public? Can you find any reason other then manipulation because if you can you are way less cynical then I am and I commend you.</p>

<p>When coal became available, it still took about 60 years for Americans to abandon wood fuel for coal fuel </p>

<p>When Natural Gas became available, it took about 60 years for Americans to abandon coal for Natural Gas </p>

<p>Your cook stove and forced air furnace are probably natural gas </p>

<p>So you prolly notice the pattern of it taking 60 years after an idea is available, until people start to adopt it en mass </p>

<p>The mobile phone might be an example of this too. When did cordless phones come out? </p>

<p>So now we have had the internet since about 1993 ???</p>

<p>So, 25 years of internet, not even half way until we realize it&#39;s full potential en mass </p>

<p>But what happens when we finally realize it&#39;s potential?</p>

<p>Many old institutions would be obsolete </p>

<p>People can create new forms of governments, contracts, banking, etc </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well peace with North Korea is a big one that tends to get ignored. Also the fact that ISIS is pretty much defeated. Trump has definitely been luckier than obama with those two issues. It looks like Syria will remain intact and not have to go through the turbulence experienced in Iraq after America decided to liberate it, which means US troops and US money won’t continue to get sucked into void. On top of that trump has managed to renegotiate some fairly lopsided trade deals that were awful for America, and he’s standing firm against China and their IP theft. 
So if you look closely heaps of things are changing </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Until we have on the spot DNA tests, children will need to be separated from the accompanying adult while the border police work out which kids are being trafficked. 
The separations happen when people are caught attempting to cross illegally rather than presenting themselves at a checkpoint, from what I remember. If a person takes 4 kids across the border illegally there is no record whatsoever of these kids being in America and they can disappear at the drop of hat and no one will come looking. Separating the kids sounds awful, but sadly I suspect a huge number are trafficking victims and every precaution should be taken.</p>

<p>&quot;Casa Padre now houses more than 1,400 immigrant boys in federal custody. While most are teenagers who entered the United States alone&quot;</p>

<p>Somehow I doubt you have any interest in explaining how you would handle this situation were it your actual responsibilty. </p>

<p>You have &quot;mostly&quot; unaccompanied children being sent to the border (per your source), which of course you helpfully glossed over to try and make a political point.</p>

<p>Those that are accompanied have an extremely good chance of being part of human trafficking. Those <em>illegal</em> immigrants that are separated and somehow &quot;disappear&quot; into this country. It&#39;s either because they are being trafficked (which if you believe the people in the border patrol aren&#39;t trying to stop then your world view is too twisted to correct), or those that most desire to have the children their custody (the family).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is happening now and the GOP controls every branch of govt.</p>

<p>While helpfully glossing over the &quot;resistance&quot; of the past two years which has worked against every single initiative, even those that would have secured the future of the DACA kids, all for political gamesmanship. </p>
