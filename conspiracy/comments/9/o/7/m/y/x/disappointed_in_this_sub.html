<p>Folks, if someone doesn’t believe the same things as you that doesn’t inherently make them a robot that has no free will. It’s almost like some people here have some sort of hero complex that makes them think that you’re special in some capacity or that you’re above people who don’t believe in some of the things this sub discusses. <em>News flash you’re not.</em> </p>

<p>I’m done with this sub, I’m sad to see it go but fuck if I’m not tired of people here acting like they’re some sort of profound messiah and that they’re somehow better than the “others.” </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you are expecting from this site. Considering we are at a low point in submitted material, it is going to require more participation in the threads that exist. Look, the CEO of Reddit is a troll. You need to adjust to the playing field. Run down the front page compared to the posts that offend you and let&#39;s talk.</p>

<p>It&#39;s good that you appreciate the sub, and if you do, it is vital that you not call your opponents children. Be funny about it. They have a sense of humour, and you just might win some of them over, even if you can&#39;t agree on everything, or anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m referring to them as children because they clearly haven’t grasped the concept of others having their own thought process. Which I’m sure many of us actually learned somewhere between the ages of 5 and 10. And while I see the irony in that statement I just don’t see the need to discuss anything with someone that immediately writes off someone having a different thought as them being brainwashed, it just isn’t worth arguing or defending against them because they don’t care or listen to reason, they would rather sit in an echo chamber and go back to pretending that they are some sort of messiah figure that only THEY are different.  </p>

<p>This conversation wouldn’t be possible if you or I believed the other to be a robot that can’t control their own machinations, but we’re having it because we’re 2 grown adults that respect others having their opinion, and we <strong>don’t</strong> assume that it’s impossible for someone to disagree with them of their own free will. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A meme would be outstanding.</p>

<p>If you do not believe in free will we all are NPC. Free will is a controversial topic in the history of philosophy. Immanuel Kant said he was a believer in free will in spite of there being not a shred of empirical evidence or an iota of sound reasoning to justify the idea.  </p>

<p>(That is not exactly what he said of course but I don&#39;t believe it is a ridiculous summation of his tortured defense.)</p>

<p>If anybody wants to offer a good support of the concept I say have a go at it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, Twitter is banning accounts with harmless MS paint faces making generic comments. The conspiracy is real. The social media companies with a virtual monopoly over online communications are actively silencing critics to protect the interests of the Democratic Party. </p>

<p>I said it before, the Left are the new reactionaries. The Right is the new counterculture. The inability of liberals to even realize what fools they are being made of by reacting with hysteria, censorship, and in some cases violence is destroying true left-wing interests. In order to defeat Trump, you sold yourselves out to neoliberals, neocons, and Communists. The damage you&#39;ve done supporting this is unknown. Just wait till Trump is out of office and YOU want to complain about something the government is doing. You&#39;ll be banned too when hating on the government is not tolerated by the media, such as it was under Obama. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not overly active on reddit, in terms of posting and commenting, you can check my profile for that. </p>

<p>With that said, while this is my first time speaking out against similar anti-intellectualism on this sub, I would like to make clear that calling people shills, NPC’s, Russian bots, etc. is abhorrent behavior and anyone guilty of such idiosyncrasies, is someone not worth even holding a discussion with. Unless of course they have sufficient evidence to refer to them as Russian bots and paid shills. An NPC however, is something I despise because there is no basis of evidence to support those claims, because they are simply untrue. People can make their own ideas, whether they are correct, incorrect, or otherwise different from someone’s else’s, just because they might be different does not mean that those conclusions could not come naturally. </p>

<p>I specifically posted about NPC’s because I wanted people on this sub to return to reality, and that reality is that differing opinions are essential for debate, and that is what this sub is based upon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a study done that found some people don&#39;t utilize an &#39;inner voice&#39; all of the time. For example, if I&#39;m waiting for a coffee, and someone that was behind me gets their coffee before me, I may think (in my own voice, in my head), &#39;unbelievable....I&#39;m never coming to this coffee shop again&#39;. Or something to some such effect.</p>

<p>This &#39;voice&#39; is tied to our ego (or, petite object a, or what makes us &#39;us&#39;); it&#39;s constantly interpreting information we receive and shaping it and molding into a narrative/story that we use to make sense of the events that occur in our lives. ex. Someone says something mean to me, I may experience my inner voice saying something to the effect of &#39;what&#39;s that person&#39;s problem? Do they really not like me? Maybe they&#39;re just mad because x, y, z.&#39; Up until recently, I think everyone assumed we all had such a voice.</p>

<p>Now, there&#39;s a study that intimates that some of us don&#39;t....some of us think either in a) symbols and not words, or b) do not have an inner voice at all, and respond to situations based on perception of what the &#39;group&#39; we belong to thinks....much like how a dog will just react to whatever emotional vibes/stimuli it senses from the pack.</p>

<p>On 4chan, people have taken the information from this study and concluded that some people are NPC&#39;s, or (non-playable characters)...like how in video games there are just characters that exist that you can interact with, but aren&#39;t good for anything more than giving you information or just repeating whatever line they&#39;re there to say.</p>

<p>What&#39;s interesting to me is the HUGE negative response to this. I don&#39;t believe I saw anything about SJWs in the initial conversation after this was originally posted, but somehow it&#39;s been twisted into a right/left thing, and now there&#39;s this whole thing about how it&#39;s &#39;dehumanizing&#39;. Obviously, the people on 4chan are happy to reap and sow any chaos they can, so they&#39;re fanning the flames....but it is interesting to me how butthurt many people have become about this one so quickly. Soy boy and Cuck and all the other memes they come up with haven&#39;t struck a nerve this hard.</p>

<p>Personally, I have had the experience of trying to have a deep conversation with someone, just to watch their eyes glaze over. I don&#39;t attribute it to them not being &#39;real people&#39;, but I think probably most of us on a conspiracy board can relate to the cognitive blocks we encounter when we try to empress information that contradicts a particular world-view on certain people. The idea that there are some people in the world that do not have a developed inner self, or internal agency/autonomy really seems to be upsetting to some people.....you&#39;re definitely going to be seeing/hearing more about this in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Silly, silly culture wars....</p>

<p>This is so true. It&#39;s like people are programmed down to their core to subconsciously reject any information that goes against their preexisting world view. Not only reject, but almost not comprehend it.  I think it&#39;s totally a result from conditioning and brainwashing. </p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing to have someone disagree with you and intellectually argue with, it&#39;s an entirely different thing when they just have this glaze over their eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>and perhaps that&#39;s the upsetting nature of this meme...it sort of calls uniform thinking out and frames it in a way that makes people who go along with the accepted narrative as literal &#39;robots&#39; of sorts. Obviously, anyone who agrees with the &#39;accepted&#39; ideas of the day (whether they have actually deeply considered the evidence or data and arrived at their own conclusion or not) will feel attacked by this. I understand how a logical conclusion could be that it&#39;s &#39;dehumanizing&#39; (and 4chan people are gleefully fueling this fire with their memes....some of which are actually, tbh, hilarious)...but I feel like the more interesting scientific aspect of how some people internally process the information they receive from the world is being twisted into some political bullshit.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s true, and there are NPCs among us. Who knows? Sucks seeing this actually interesting study warped into a weapon for the culture wars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The NPC meme isn&#39;t about conspiracies. It is about people talking like pre-programmed bots repeating a script. They don&#39;t discuss anything, seemingly have no pulse, or have no unique opinions. Just the same &quot;orange man bad&quot; nonsense. </p>

<p>The age of having debate is over. The modern era is about quick smark parroted from late night hosts and drive-by headlines with stories that nobody bothers to read. </p>

<p>Like, sure TMOR are trolls, but at least I might convince some of them to move on with their lives. Don&#39;t underestimate the power your voice has on these platforms.</p>

<p>NPC memes are funny. Just turn them around is all.</p>
