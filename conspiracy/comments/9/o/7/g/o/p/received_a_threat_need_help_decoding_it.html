    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re still not saying anything about Jesus Christ or salvation by faith alone in Jesus Christ. Or that you can only fight demons in the name of Jesus Christ.

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus isn&#39;t just the son of God, <em>He is God</em>. And He is the only way to God. And He is the only mediator between God and man. So if any being you believe is God isn&#39;t 100% pointing you to Jesus Christ - <strong>it isn&#39;t God.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: <em>no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.</em></p>

<p>1 Tim 2:5 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus</p>

<p>John 20:26-28 And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. And Thomas answered and said unto him, <strong>My Lord and my God.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have not honored Him if you have not believed  that you can only be saved by faith in His blood for forgiveness of sins. And that through faith in Him only can you receive the Holy Spirit, put on the armor of God, and fight against the wiles of the devil. You cannot fight the devil in any way if you don&#39;t believe in your heart these things. It is so detrimental that you can&#39;t even <strong>discern</strong> between good and evil without having been saved, okay.</p>

<p>If your desire truly is to serve God, then you need to look to Christ. You need to read your bible. And you need to compare everything that you think you know to what the bible actually says. Because it says that all scripture is profitable to instruct you and correct you when you&#39;re wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 Tim 3:16 <strong>All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you also need to be wary of your own thoughts about what you&#39;re doing... And also be wary of anything you think you hear... Because it may seem right to you. But it may not actually be God and it may not actually be right. As the Bible itself warns us specifically of that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Proverbs 14:12 There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Devils masquerade as God <strong>all the time.</strong> The Bible is quick to tell you that. And don&#39;t think you&#39;re beyond being deceived - because no one is beyond being deceived. If you&#39;re a man made of flesh, you&#39;re capable of being deceived. You can&#39;t just trust your own heart </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Proverbs 28:26 <strong>He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool:</strong> but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered</p>
</blockquote>
