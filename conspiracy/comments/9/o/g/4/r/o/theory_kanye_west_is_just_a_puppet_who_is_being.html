        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-10-15 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Stere0titical.html">Stere0titical</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I believe there was a time where Kanye West actually was an outspoken critic of the system and a bit of a &quot;wild card&quot;. Does anybody recall during the Hurricane Katrina relief advertisement, when he said on live tv, &quot;George Bush doesn&#39;t care about black people, and the media is portraying us negatively on purpose&quot;?</p>

<p>Or when he dropped a mention to Pizzagate awhile back?</p>

<p>After that, he was placed into a mental health facility and hospitalized, perhaps against his will in an effort to &quot;rehabilitate&quot; him. Celebrities with influence who try to wake the masses and criticize the establishment are often given a talking to or threatened into complying and playing ball again.</p>

<p>So, after being a volatile thorn in the side of TPTB, standing up for African Americans and bringing attention to the scandals of the elites, perhaps part of the &quot;deal&quot; they offered him to keep his career and his wealth, was that he would be required to cheerlead for the president, in hopes of herding his supporters and followers into supporting the current administration. Trump and the Republicans are not very popular with the African American demographic, and it all just reeks of a pre-midterm election stunt (let me reiterate that I reject the two party system entirely and am just elaborating on some potential manipulation).</p>

<p>Perhaps this was the penance he owed them. If you&#39;re a celebrity who is volatile and willing to call out TPTB on live TV and during your concerts, you are going to be dealt with, and they are creative at coming up with ways to make it look organic and inconspicuous. Then, if you wish to keep your career, they are going to keep you on a tight leash, create some blackmail, or force you to do a favor for them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok let me get this as straight as I can then based on your theory.   </p>

<p>Kanye goes on rants and is bashed by the MSM and entertainment industry for being &quot;crazy&quot; and &quot;there there&quot; with &quot;voices in his head&quot;.<br/>
So then the (R) party decides that he would be a great pickup to help with the black vote. The (D)&#39;s are furious to lose such a trusted black man of their cause that they then go and get Taylor Swift to help side with them? </p>

<p>On contrary, in today&#39;s super sensitive environment, it is in the best interest of any public figure or celebrity to voluntarily enter rehab or seek some form of official psychiatric help. Plus, that shit really helps people, so how is this a bad thing?</p>

<p>^^  &quot;in hopes of herding his supporters and followers into supporting the current administration. Trump and the Republicans are not very popular with the African American demographic,&quot;</p>

<p>Dude, just google, &quot;black americans for trump&quot; and you will see that your claims of african americans being out of favor with trump are very far from reality.  Every black american is capable of making their own decisions. Unless, that black american is Kayne? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps, in this time of hatred among the people, he just chose love. Perhaps he just chose progress. Perhaps he chose to actually make a difference instead of bicker with the other side. Perhaps he saw an opening to actually make a HUGE difference for the black community outside of his music, instead of just talking about it.</p>

<p>-Talks of bringing jobs to Chicago
-Talks of amending the 13th amendment
-Artist now own their music</p>

<p>Plus having Kanye working with the president is only going to help Trump truly see the other sides views. When Kanye brought the &quot;Make America Great&quot; hat for Trump and simply said &quot;because it hasn&#39;t always been great for some folks&quot; you could tell that honestly Trump may not have seen it that way before. </p>

<p>This is how you keep left leaning policies in place, not screaming fascist at the first person who doesn&#39;t see your way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Instead of fighting with each other on who did/said what, take time to appreciate the progress being made right in front of you.</p>

<p>-41% approval rate and rising
-Better economy (even though you don&#39;t want to believe it was him but Obama)
-Winning the trade war
-Lower unemployment rate
-Highest black employment rate in the last 15 years
-Working towards bringing more jobs to America (more than he has already brought)
-Working towards amending the 13th amendment</p>

<p>Man I waited 8 years for change from a man I voted for, and got it in 2 with a guy I didn&#39;t vote for. I&#39;m not saying you have to like Trump, I truly believe in personal freedoms and your freedom to not like the US president. What I&#39;m trying to say is instead of fighting with your fellow American try love and understanding. Instead of fighting progress, help progress along.</p>

<p>To answer the question, supporting the current administration is showing love for this country and individuals living in it. Currently more is being done for citizens than I have ever seen in my lifetime.</p>

<p>Now to turn this back to you, how is you hating and demonizing everything the right does helping your cause? I&#39;m all ears, and would genuinely like to hear your side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 2008, I read dozens of good quality articles critical of Obama. I listened to Obama say things that I didn&#39;t like. Then, I watched the messianic Obama inauguration, recognizing that the contrast between that day and the coming days would cause people like you to become disappointed and backlash against him.</p>

<p>So, you&#39;re right. You can&#39;t change my mind. I predicted you ten years ago.</p>
