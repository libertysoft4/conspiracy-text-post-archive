Why don&#39;t we put as much value on natural methods of healing as we do on medicine given to us by the pharmaceutical industry? In reality the scientists that make this medicine are combing over nature and looking at plants, mushrooms, animals, etc, for things that work and can be synthesized into its chemical components to be patented. They discredit the very plants that they get the cure from in the public arena, and have perpetuated the concealment of natural medicine by wiping out indigenous cultures and suppressing knowledge for the almighty dollar to the detriment of their fellow man. </p>

<p>So better make a replica in pill form and lobby to ban the former!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never see anyone demonizing kratom or pot unless they’re over 60. </p>

<p>I see this demonizing is most commonly spent on people who know better than their doctors and give their children chilled plum juice and crystals for cancer and shit. </p>

<p><em>That’s</em> what I think of when I think of natural medicine. </p>

<p>I guess...where is the line between smoking a plant and eating plum juice when it comes to absurdity. But I think the natural medicine demonizing is based on people who outright shun mainstream medicine and only use natural remedies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just answered your own question! And to further it... TPTB and those who make the $ while suppressing cheap and natural healing + self sustainability have done a great job of making this kind of stuff part of the &quot;left vs right&quot; argument. This keeps a huge part of the population biased to this information right off the bat. I do see things starting to shift though. I am in year 12 of sustainable farming and *mostly off grid living... growing all my own food and making all kinds of different herbal concoctions. Before that I ate healthy, organic, mostly vegetarian for 10 years. Doing it yourself with clean growing methods will take your health to another level. I haven&#39;t been sick or to the doctors in 25 + years. Coming up on 40 and feel 20. Brain is focused like a razor. It&#39;s the real deal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re completely correct.<br/>
The only thing I&#39;ll take issue with is calling them scientist. They don&#39;t deserve that title.<br/>
Also, I&#39;ll add rain forest slash &amp; burn as a likely part of the process.<br/>
They likely send in a team to collect plant samples before and area is slashed &amp; burned, then bring them back to the lab for synthesis and testing. Their hope being that the slash &amp; burn will completely destroy the species (or make it extremely rare) and they will be the only source. It also allows them to destroy or shelf cures for the diseases they profit off of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you answered your own question. for example look at all the businesses and organizations that deal with Cancer. If they cured cancer all of those would go away. I saw on one website that cancer is a 2 trillion dollar a year business. </p>

<p>Now imagine drinking tree bark tree, that you can get from almost any tree for a week and your cancer is cured. Probably will never happen, but we won&#39;t know because we keep it suppressed. There is a major conspiracy theory out there that almost all of our major diseases have cures but the companies won&#39;t let them out, unless you have the money. Remember how Magic Johnson has aids and back then the life expediency was a year, well hes still alive! Guess money talks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh Jesus christ this thread was started about how natural medicine isn&#39;t mainstream.  Healthy food is a huge fucking business so it doesn&#39;t fit what the hell we are talking about does it? There is a giant trend towards antibiotic/pesticide free foods, less sugar, less gluten, fats being ok for you, and a bunch of other healthy food trends. And yeah if you need more or this or that you eat more foods with what you need in it.  Or if you have a bad response to something you don&#39;t eat things with that in it. But it is not medicine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m not being dense rather I&#39;m stating that food can indeed be used as a natural medicine.</p>

<p>Our bodies are able to take what is necessary out of what we consume. It is the most natural way to address an issue. But you are the dense one by not recognizing that. I&#39;m not saying eating food can address all medical issues that would be absurd. Why don&#39;t you look into it a little. Do some reading on food as medicine. </p>

<p>The only thing I would add is it just isn&#39;t labeled as natural medicine. </p>

<p>How can you get more natural of a medicine when quite literally the natural process of the body extract w/e is needed out of the food. So eating the right kinds of foods can address a number a varying issues a person might have.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>So if a person eats some foods to treat a symptom and that symptom goes away based on the food that person was eating do we not have a natural medicine? Or what do you call it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So to you there isn&#39;t a difference between say broccoli and a medicinal plant such as st John&#39;s wart?</p>

<p>Also do you consider the air in each breath you take as a dose of medicine.  After all your body takes what it needs from it (oxygen) in the more natural way possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I am saying that they both can be considered natural medicine. Though I do think there is a difference. Some people can treat depression with a regiment of healthy eating and exercise. But some might prefer or can&#39;t eat the necessary foods that might help treat depression so there are other options. St John&#39;s wort being one of them.</p>

<p>I suppose my body would not function if I couldn&#39;t breathe oxygen. Though I don&#39;t consider it a medicine, my body needs it, without I would be dead. You could use Oxygen, in other ways to help revitalize the body, so yes Oxygen, &quot;not the air&quot; could be used as a medicine. </p>

<p>But the air I breathe probably not a medicine unless I came from a severely smog riddled area stay there for an extended period of time then moved to a less polluted area, I would probably find that breathing in a large dose of fresh air would likely improve so aspects of my being. After an extended stay in a largely polluted area.</p>

<p>I do think that natural medicines are being suppressed, but not all avenues are suppressed. I don&#39;t understand your point of view fully I guess. Why can&#39;t food be consider part of a natural medicine? what defines a natural medicine to you? I don&#39;t think we are on opposing sides. Perhaps labels are getting in the way of our discussion. </p>

<p>So are you saying you can&#39;t treat ailments with food?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe Americans are dumbassed because you go around parading their idiocy like it&#39;s a fact. </p>

<p>That homeopathy uses natural ingredients doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s literally the same thing as &quot;natural medicine.&quot; Which is an umbrella term that could encompass pretty much anything depending on your definition. </p>

<p>That homeopathy works through placebo and faith-based healing methods doesn&#39;t make it bullshit for everybody. Only for hardcore skepdicks who&#39;s psychic disease is on par with hypochondriacs for how deleterious their ideology is to their health. </p>

<p>I added that last sentence just to piss you off, it  really does represent my observations. My grandmother is dying of rat poisoning because that&#39;s what big pharma told her dr. to prescribe. In fact, she can&#39;t eat healthy food because her rat poison prevents it. Which has almost nothing to do with homeopathy other than her dogheadedness in blindly trusting a profit-driven &quot;healthcare&quot; industry over decades of nutritional science jt killing her. Just like people who live in denial of the research that shows our bodies can heal themselves suffer and die because invasive medicine is all the rage these days.</p>

<p>Modern pharmaceutics and chemistry can isolate the effective and safe medical compound, find alternative high volume manufacturing methods (instead of cutting down all forests, ok exaggerating a little bit) and produce standardized and effective doses with long storage time through-out the year. All something that can be difficult to achieve if using just plants as medicines.</p>

<p>And of course, it&#39;s very good business ;-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh Jesus christ this thread was started about how natural medicine isn&#39;t mainstream.  Healthy food is a huge fucking business so it doesn&#39;t fit what the hell we are talking about does it? There is a giant trend towards antibiotic/pesticide free foods, less sugar, less gluten, fats being ok for you, and a bunch of other healthy food trends. And yeah if you need more or this or that you eat more foods with what you need in it.  Or if you have a bad response to something you don&#39;t eat things with that in it. But it is not medicine. </p>
