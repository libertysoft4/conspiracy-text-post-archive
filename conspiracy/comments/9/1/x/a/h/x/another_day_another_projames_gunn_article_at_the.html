<p>The top comment at almost 18k upvotes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a really good article. Especially this quote:</p>

<p>To demand that every artist who works for you to have never had a past, to have never had jagged edges that have been sanded over time, is asking for people who will make boring art.</p>

<p>I hope Disney takes note of how many celebrities and journalists (as well as the public) are coming out against them and in support of James Gunn.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>James Gunn made comments about masturbating with kids, hoping they touch him, about cumming on their faces. Where&#39;s the joke exactly? Some of the people he &#39;joked&#39; with are in jail for their actions.</p>

I haven&#39;t seen any article about it because search results are polluted with other stories, but if that&#39;s the case... What else did he really expect?</p>

<p>I&#39;m a free speech absolutist and think that neither of them should have been fired, and I don&#39;t even like Roseanne but I love Gunn. Been a fan since Slither..</p>

<p>If it&#39;s true, he deserves it for partaking/supporting in the PC culture job lynch mobs. You reap what you sow. If it&#39;s not true, he&#39;s just another victim.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll bounce back on his feet, he&#39;s a talented guy and has shown he can be at the helm of hundred-million dollar blockbusters.</p>

<p>There is a distinction there, though. Gunn&#39;s posts were written years ago and he aplogised for them years ago too, if I&#39;m not mistaken. Roseanne&#39;s tweets were in the present. Now, I&#39;m okay if you think they should both be treated the same, but that means that you can&#39;t allow for people to change or to grow and apologise. And if making abhorrent but perfectly legal jokes is something that can never be forgiven, surely the same must be true of actual crimes ? If Gunn should lose his job because of something reprehensible he wrote years ago, surely anybody who has been to prison for, say, a violent crime in the past should also lose their job?</p>

But, there is consequences to our actions... even though we have the right to say it. If I remember correctly he was all for the Rosanne firing and calling Trump a racist etc... He has that right (of course) but he also might suffer the consequences. Once again thank you for your response and I hope James Gunn can get over his demons and learn from this.

<p>In the case of an actor, how could they not fire her? Being that popular isn&#39;t a &quot;job&quot; in the sense that you or I have. If they kept running the show, people would likely boycott it and hurt the network. Or start attacking the costars for &quot;supporting a racist &quot; or whatever. I agree that regular Joe&#39;s shouldn&#39;t be fired for non-criminal acts that have nothing to do with their employers. </p>

<p>Nope. I am basing my opinions on the evidence.</p>

<p>I have asked you for evidence he has abused children three times now.</p>

<p>You obviously have none.</p>

<p>Until then we go with what Gunn say it was; a joke.</p>

<p>Really, a lot of his co-workers signed a letter stating they think his firing was inappropriate. So maybe it wasn&#39;t that toxic after all. I guess no one you work with has a dark sense of humor.</p>

<p>It is rampant in all strict religious communities.</p>

<p>You&#39;re more than welcome to post the exact verse/source here for all readers to see and come to a conclusion </p>

<p>A b&#39;raisa: Rabbi Shim&#39;on ben Yochai says: A female who converted to Judaism below the age of three years and one day is permissible to a kohein.1 As the verse states: &quot;But all the female children that have not known relations with a man, keep them alive for yourselves&quot; (B&#39;midbar 31:18).2</p>

<p>Again this is in relation to whether or not the girl is a virgin before the age of 3 and is eligible for marriage as a virgin (priests are only allowed to marry virgins). In other words if someone raped a baby she would still be considered a virgin.</p>

<p>Another passage which is explicitly against pedophilia.</p>

<p>&quot;A man may marry off his daughter when she is a na&#39;ara&quot;:3 When she is a na&#39;ara, yes. When she is a child, no. This supports the teaching of Rav, for Rav Y&#39;huda said in the name of Rav, and there are those who say Rabbi El&#39;azar, &quot;It is forbidden for a man to marry off his daughter when she is a child, until she grows up and says, &#39;I want to marry So-and-so.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>The Rabbis taught in a b&#39;raisa: Converts4 and those who play with little girls delay the coming of the Messiah... The latter refers to those who marry [and have sexual relations with] girls who are too young to [safely]5 bear children. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Astroturfing is the practice of masking the sponsors of a message or organization (e.g., political, advertising, religious or public relations) to make it appear as though it originates from and is supported by a grassroots participant(s). It is a practice intended to give the statements or organizations credibility by withholding information about the source&#39;s financial connection. The term astroturfing is derived from AstroTurf, a brand of synthetic carpeting designed to resemble natural grass, as a play on the word &quot;grassroots.&quot; The implication behind the use of the term is that instead of a &quot;true&quot; or &quot;natural&quot; grassroots effort behind the activity in question, there is a &quot;fake&quot; or &quot;artificial&quot; appearance of support.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only time pedo jokes are even close to funny is if they are clearly joking at the expense of the pedo. Even then it can be murky and I&#39;m not partial to that material for telling jokes cause who cares if a thousand people laugh if one child abuse victim didn&#39;t get and wound up depressed because of a stupid joke. I&#39;m not much for worrying about triggering people but some topics are better left out of the joke. If someone is somehow trying to raise awareness about something and purposely making people uncomfortable they better be spot on with their message and not at all doing it disingenuously. I only read a couple tweets by Gunn and it was plenty enough for me to say fuck him. His tweets were fucking gross, good on Disney for firing him.</p>

<p>The hypocrisy from one side or the other is one thing, but be careful not to let shills get to you by pretending to be sticking up for Gunn just to cause discord.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never heard of Pedo-Bear. I&#39;m old and out of touch and not tuned into the meme thing too much. From what it sounds like I would probably want to murder Pedo-Bear. However, if he is popular I don&#39;t think it&#39;s all a degenerate audience in the classical sense. I think some are no doubt degenerate but don&#39;t forget the crazy, angsty youngsters. They can be really raw these days but I think most out grow it. They probably don&#39;t understand the depths of what they are laughing at. All they see is a goofy bear doing some shit that makes their subconscious uncomfortable while making their conscious self feel a little rebellious at watching something taboo.</p>

<p>Also don&#39;t underestimate the power of fucking shills and bit armies from foreign powers to do shit to make America look bad and to make us fight amongst ourselves. I bet that explains at least a portion of the sick shit that gets upvoted on social media. That my guess as to how the whole Elsa gate vids got popular to be honest. Definitely could be wrong though.</p>

<p>You say it so non chalante, yet with a palpable edge to it. No shit comedy offends some people. It&#39;s when it offends that one child who is being molested that I take a step back and say, hey, maybe there&#39;s a bazillion other fucking jokes that can be cracked without offending the victim of child abuse. But that&#39;s just MY opinion.</p>

<p>&quot;...it&#39;s a person&#39;s right to police their own emotions or not...&quot;</p>

<p>You think a child without a fully developed brain or emotional standard that is also being victimized has the competence to police their own emotions while reading through some tweets that got upvoted or shown around class while all his peers are laughing and the kid just can&#39;t understand why anyone would laugh at something so horrific. That one kid is vastly more important too me than all the knuckleheads laughing at a shitty joke made by some douchebag pre-madonna director will ever be. It&#39;s called living in a civilized society dude. Kids are the future. I&#39;m partial the walking that line between protecting them enough to grow strong and healthy and allowing them to be exposed to &quot;the real world.&quot; The society I want to live in doesn&#39;t continue to reward trolls like Gunn with hundreds of millions of dollars in movie contracts with a past history of shitting on victims of child abuse for fucking tweeter status.</p>

<p>Stay edgy bruh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&gt; Where&#39;s the joke exactly? Some of the people he &#39;joked&#39; with are in jail for their actions. </p>

<p>Because they are not famous artists. We (I?) always had problems to find the right balance of seeing an art piece independent of the creator, which sucks if the creator is simply a shitty person. I find it hard to pretend that e.g. Polanski or Spacey or Wagner for that are/were not amazing artists and, assuming that no one got hurt, i&#39;m already willing to cut them at bit more slack - a step further: I you need nom fetish/mania to be a good artist let them have it: Imprison Spacey, freeze all assets but let him play in movies. Give him literally no outlet except that of an artist and send each and every penny of his earnings to his victims. </p>

<p>so, back to the topic at hand: You react the hardest on topics which you feel emotionally connected to - someone who experiences racism on a daily base doesn&#39;t really need a actress being just another racist, a woman which already feels the glass ceiling/experienced sexism will react far stronger than a man which didn&#39;t have similar experiences. But here you have no downplay of the act, you don&#39;t have Gunn saying that it ia actually ok to molest minors and aside of the girl in the video there is nobody which could actually feel molested (asuming that there isn&#39;t more hidden and that Gunn didn&#39;t actually molested minors) and only because Gunn actually admitted in public to the act. </p>

<p>And if there would have been no victims if Gunn didn&#39;t actually wrote about it I have troubles to but him in the same basket as actual molesters or as people which  publicly promote discriminating worldvies/hate-speech. Tough I probably be careful not to leave him alone with minors..</p>

<p>Some dude said shocking things on the internet at a time when it was popular to be an edgy boy online. Half the people here have certainly seen if not authored much worse shit. How many people are here are 4chan regulars? Yet this is just too disgusting for you to handle?</p>

<p>I think the issue here is not what was said, it is the hypocrisy of targeting certain people while getting outraged when one of their own gets caught up in the witch hunt. Claiming this is proof that Gunn is in the middle of some pedo conspiracy is ludicrous, it&#39;s the same witch-hunt life ruining bullshit the sjw&#39;s pull.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Granted, maybe some people aren&#39;t being disingenuous, but I think a lot of people have different motivations regarding this story.</p>

<p>No doubt some people are fans and want him to keep making movies, and some are surely SJW&#39;s who think he is their ally. I also think plenty are probably right wingers who want to shove a SJW&#39;s nose in his own shit, which I don&#39;t necessarily blame them for, but it is disingenuous.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things that people don&#39;t find humorous, that doesn&#39;t mean nobody does, or that the author didn&#39;t simply swing and miss. But if what he said in 2008 was so outrageous why did it take 10 years for anyone to notice?</p>

<p>Also, since it sounds like I&#39;m a defender of Gunn, I&#39;ll note that I&#39;m not sure I had ever heard of him before this story, and considering he works for Disney, it&#39;s tough to argue that he shouldn&#39;t have lost his job. This is not the kind of shit you can have on record if you want to work for a company like Disney.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its fucking pathetic and disgusting how vehemently people are defending this guy. Any &quot;average Joe&quot; would be fired for those tweets, but since the guy makes summer blockbusters he should get a pass?? I dont think so. </p>

<p>Those &quot;jokes&quot; were, at the very least, highly inappropriate and unworthy of tolerance. Especially for someone of his stature. Although, its Hollywood, so I can&#39;t say I&#39;m all that surprised. </p>

<p>Shame though, I did love Guardians of the Galexy. It&#39;s getting to the point where I can barely enjoy anything Hollywood puts out. It&#39;s a sick fucked-up culture we&#39;re living in, where as long as you make funny movies, you can obsessively joke about rapping little boys, and people will defend you tooth and nail if you get in trouble for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, no he wouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Any Average Joe would make those tweets and no one would care. This is all up in everyone&#39;s face because Gunn&#39;s famous.</p>

<p>Also, <em>if</em> said Average Joe was fired for such tweets, he&#39;d be able to take the employer to court for wrongful dismissal, and possibly infringing on his right to free speech.</p>

<p>I see a few people on here realizing that nothing is sacred, and anything can be joked about, this gives me hope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, yes he would. People have been fired for posting less deplorable things than he did.</p>

<p>James Gunn&#39;s abhorrent behavior is being defended because he&#39;s famous. Any average Joe would post those tweets and people would be disgusted and rightly so.</p>

<p>Also, that&#39;s not true. Depending on where you live your employer can terminate you at any time for any reason. The decision is left entirely at their discretion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s sad your country has so little in the way of worker protections.</p>

<p>That shit doesn&#39;t fly up here. A while ago, during that &quot;Fuck her right in the pussy&quot; fad, a guy at a ballgame said it on camera. He was fired from his job at the provincial power company, despite not being in any way affiliated with the company at the time, no branding, no mention of his employment, yet they fired him. And were forced to reinstate him. It&#39;s a matter of free speech, and the fact is if you&#39;re being fired because you exercised free speech, you&#39;ve been victimized.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Freedom of Speech does NOT mean that a person can say whatever they want to say. Freedom of Speech means that someone&#39;s right to say something is protected within certain limits. A person may have to suffer consequences for saying some things, but they still have the right to say them. For example, it is against the law to yell, &quot;FIRE,&quot; in a crowded place because someone may get injured. A person has the right to say it, but they also have the consequences.</p>

<p>In fact, there are 9 categories of speech that are not protected by the first amendment.</p>

<ul>
<li>Obscenity</li>
<li>Fighting words</li>
<li>Defamation (including libel and slander)</li>
<li>Child pornography</li>
<li>Perjury</li>
<li>Blackmail</li>
<li>Incitement to imminent lawless action</li>
<li>True threats</li>
<li>Solicitations to commit crimes</li>
</ul>

<p>Some experts also would add treason, if committed verbally, to that list. Plagiarism of copyrighted material is also not protected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be that as it may, poking fun at any and all of those things is well within the strictures of free speech.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Gunn is clean, but old edgy texts is in no way proof of anything. At this point, especially with #Metoo, people will come forward to accuse him... But until that happens, it looks like an edgy writer being edgy at an edgy cultural time, would it offend some people? Sure, but that&#39;s their problem. He shouldn&#39;t have been fired for just that.</p>
