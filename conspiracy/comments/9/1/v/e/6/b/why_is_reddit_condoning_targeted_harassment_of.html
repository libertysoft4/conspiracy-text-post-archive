        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is meta discussion concerning recent events including events in this sub.<br/>
I hope mods are ok with this discussion.</p>

<p>I woke up yesterday, started browsing reddit and found my user account on a list of accounts to be harassed.</p>

<p>Mods (of other subs) and users were encouraging harassement and brigading of accounts of users that have spoken out about James Gunn and Dan Harmon.</p>

<p>I visit and post in r/the_donald and I am not part of any claimed &quot;organized&quot; effort. I object to being harassed for voicing that <a href="https://imgur.com/a/rvbDryr">James Gunn</a> and Dan Harmon <a href="https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1532293518224.webm">NSFW</a> should not be supported for normalizing child rape and paedophilia.</p>

<p><strong>Where was the Admin team?</strong></p>

<p>A mod of r/MarchAgainstNazis r/bestoff intentionally ignored site wide rules and gleefully encouraged targeted harassment of users yesterday.</p>

<p>Ironically those claiming to &quot;March Against Nazis&quot; are the ones engaging in Nazi tactics.</p>

<p>I was brigaded and harassed all day long.</p>

<p>The toxicity on Reddit is becoming ridiculous. The majority of the hyperpartisan toxicity including harassment, vote manipulation, and brigading is being stoked and fed by paid astroturf connected to subs created to spread hate about Donald Trump (and Bernie, r/EnoughSandersSpam). These people stalk users, label users, bully, silence, and prevent civil discussion while encouraging others to join in.</p>

<p>They create lists of users, encourage others to tag them with RES, link topics to other subs, then publicly harass, and downvote with bury brigades.</p>

<p>It&#39;s brown shirt tactics.</p>

<p>The admin team has done nothing to clamp down or stop it.</p>

<p>This is not what Aaron would have wanted.</p>

<p><strong>Meta discussion</strong> (about Reddit)</p>

<p>I post in r/the_donald (and also in r/conspiracy) because it&#39;s actually a place where civil dicussion can happen (unlike r/news, r/worldnews, r/politics). Those subs have been influenced heavily by paid messaging, brigading, and vote manipulation, with interests connected to the Democrat Party. It&#39;s an echo chamber and not a place for open debate or balanced information.</p>

<p>Look at the r/worldnews mod team. There are over 10 users on that team who mod astroturf subs with NGO connections or political subs directly controlled by one political party. Want to guess which party?  The mods don&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem.</p>

<p>Since Bernie lost the primary much of Reddit has turned into a shitpile even the non-political subs. The vote manipulation and guilded posts are not fooling anyone. Algorithms to silence trump supporters also isn&#39;t fooling anyone. Paid astroturf is ruining reddit.</p>

<p>Two seasons ago in Homeland s06e10 (&quot;sock puppets&quot;) they had a boiler room type scene depicting NGO paid astroturf.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EufH0T196bY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EufH0T196bY</a> </p>

<p>Admin, mods, and some users might not realize it, but the level of manipulation, harassment and propaganda is driving people toward Trump, not away from him.</p>

<p>The Democrats have no message other than Russia, Russia, Russia, hate Trump.</p>

<p>BTW, I voted for Bernie, not that it matters.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a mod of r/bestof (**is the Reddit Admin team going to ban him for encouraging users be harassed?)</p>

<p>These weren&#39;t jokes.</p>

<p>Gunn deleted 10,000 tweets and his blog.  One of his friends was recently convicted for possessing child pornagraphy. Did you even look at what was there before he deleted it?</p>

<p>Gunn  had a laundry list of baggage and skeletons <a href="https://imgur.com/a/rvbDryr">celebrating child rape and sexual abuse of children</a> yet he was trying to tear down careers of others over the past few months. </p>

<p>Which is exactly what James Gunn said in 2015 and in 2018, before the general public learned of his comments normalizing paedophilia and child rape.</p>

<p>ames Gunn from May 2015 brilliantly describing James Gunn of 2018.  LOL </p>

Even if it were 100% true that your (and T_D&#39;s) sole motivation was to call attention to something you actually fervently believed was an instance of pedophilia, you&#39;ve poisoned the well so badly via previous actions that it doesn&#39;t make any sense to take your comments at face value.

As I said above, it just isn&#39;t rational for someone who has prior knowledge about how T_D operates to <em>ever</em> assume that someone who routinely participates there is acting in good faith, nor that they are genuinely concerned about pedophilia, or that they are using sound reasoning when it comes to debate.</p>

<p>There&#39;s only so much time in the world, and nobody wants to waste it bickering over priors, the definitions of words, or other types of disingenuous prattle. People have learned that&#39;s what they&#39;re getting when they interact with T_D, so they avoid doing it. Again, if you want to change that, you&#39;ll have to motivate change throughout T_D, or demonstrate to others up front why you&#39;re different and unique.</p>

<p>Judicial Watch has been doing FOIA requests for a long time, back to 1994.  You should really look into their history.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Watch#Bush_Administration">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Watch#Bush_Administration</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bush Administration</p>

<p>In July 2003 Judicial Watch joined the environmental organization Sierra Club in suing the George W. Bush administration for access to minutes of Vice President Dick Cheney&#39;s Energy Task Force.[7] Judicial Watch was involved in a similar legal dispute with Vice President Dick Cheney in 2002 when the group filed a shareholder lawsuit against Halliburton. The lawsuit, which accused Halliburton of accounting fraud, alleged that &quot;when Mr. Cheney was chief executive of Halliburton, he and other directors inflated revenue reports, boosting Halliburton&#39;s share price.&quot;[8] As reported by the Wall Street Journal the court filing claims the oil-field-services concern overstated revenue by a total of $445 million from 1999 through the end of 2001.[9][10] </p>

<p>John Oliver did praise Chavez for some things.  He didn&#39;t state exactly that the regime was unsustainable, he said that Chavez failed to consider and plan for market volatility.   Translation, Chavez spent everything and didn&#39;t save any funds for when the price per barrel dropped.</p>
