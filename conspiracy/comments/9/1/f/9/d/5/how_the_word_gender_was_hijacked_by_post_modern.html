        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In ordinary speech, gender and sex are used interchangeably because they used to mean the same thing. The word sex just had an additional meaning to it, as in the act itself so that is why the word gender was used instead. But the post modern interpretation of the difference between sex and gender is irrational and unscientific because of biology and worldwide historical precedent. </p>

<p>For example, no other language in the world (except closely related to English) distinguishes the difference between sex and gender. Try to translate the word sex or gender into another language and there is only one word for it. Some languages like Spanish even genders their nouns to masculine and feminine. 
The label “transgender” can be translated and this group of people have existed throughout history, among all groups of people. 
Today the word gender has been weaponized to somehow imply there are more than 2 sexes/genders. Meaningless words like genderqueer, genderless or gender neutral were introduced. The fact is, an individual cannot force society to separate sex from social/gender roles that are attached to it, since these familial roles are essential for reproduction and an integral part of the social fabric. These gender/sex roles were used throughout all human history regardless of location. This fundamental subversion of social norms is used to further divide the people so they are distracted from the real issues and fragmented groups are easier to manipulate. Pseudo-intellectuals are paid to endorse transient and sterile relationships and this will weaken the social order. 
Ultimately the post modernists are working for the interests of the oligarchs than the interests of the general public. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Biology is science. Science deals with the realm of concepts that exist in reality. The post modern interpretation of the word gender can only apply to transgenderism. I have no idea what gender neutral or genderless or genderqueer or any other made up genders mean, because they don’t exist in the real world. 
The propagation of the species is not a reason to stop change? Unless you want to destroy the family structure and go full Brave New World so the State creates children. It’s called a dystopia. </p>

<p>Transgender doesn&#39;t necessarily mean a man who identifies as a woman or vice versa. It can mean a man who identifies as neither. So you may want to check your definitions there. </p>

<p>Transgender - <em>&quot;denoting or relating to a person whose sense of personal identity and gender does not correspond with their birth sex.&quot;</em></p>

<p>No.  The field is rife with fraud and a significant amount, if not majority,  of studies cannot be reproduced.  Just look at what was recently revealed about the Zimbardo prisoner experiment - arguably the most famous of them all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree on your definitions of these two terms.</p>

<p>In the science community, a person’s sex has been defined as biological: XX, XY, etc. Gender is social, in the sense that gender types and roles vary across multiple cultures. For example, in many Native American Cultures there are at least three to five genders. There are Polyamorous Matriarchal societies in Asia, which flips traditional Western gender roles. Ancient Roman views on homosexuality, Eunuch concubines as a third gender go back thousands of years in the Middle East and China. </p>

<p>Each society constructs its own version of gender roles and identity. None of them are right or wrong, they just are.</p>

<p>In ordinary speech, gender and sex are used interchangeably because they used to mean the same thing. The word sex just had an additional meaning to it, as in the act itself so that is why the word gender was used instead.</p>

<p>Here is the early etymology. Prior to 1920, sex meant male or female, biologically, and gender meant masculine or feminine in languages that have a gender assigned to every noun. Coitus was sometimes referred to as sexual intercourse or sexual relations, but it was not commonly spoken about, so there was no reason for anyone to mentally expand a mention of sex (often used to mean just male or female) to mean sexual relations.</p>

<p>In the &quot;Roaring 20&#39;s&quot;, the age of the flapper and the peak of the Progressive Era, &quot;sexual intercourse&quot; and &quot;sexual relations&quot; got shortened to just sex. Thus, as you say, people quickly (I.e. also in the 1920s) switched to using gender to mean male or female biologically in order to avoid conjuring up images of coitus.</p>

<p>It is ironic, then, that this linguistic attempt at Christian modesty should later become a bludgeon by secular society to force discussion of (and political acceptance of) acts that Christians hold to be so sinful as to not usually even be talked about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because what else can an individual be but biologically male or female. </p>

<p>Transgender means they don’t identify with birth. You can only be born male or female. </p>

<p>What does it mean to identify as neither gender or a 3rd gender? Sounds like an alien to me. </p>

<p>My one main issue with your post is where do you draw the line? What about intersex people, hermaphroditism, or if you have XXY chromosomes. There are people on this planet living right now who can’t be defined biologically only male or only female. It’s a natural phenomenon.</p>

<p>Is this where we pretend that extremely rare genetic abnormalities justify forcing the public to pretend that the guys in drag are not guys in drag, which 99% really are. </p>
