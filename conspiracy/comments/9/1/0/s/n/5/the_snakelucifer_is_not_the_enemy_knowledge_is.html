        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Remember the tale of Adam and Eve and how they lost their ignorance and began toiling away, suffering thanks to biting the apple and listening to the snake?</p>

<p>Pain is a part of life. This is what helps us realize we are alive and teaches us to appreciate what we have. If we have nothing to compare to, we just exist without meaning, stuck in a loop. Although too much pain can cause loops as well, pain is an inherent and integral part of life.</p>

<p>The serpent and Lucifer represent wisdom and knowledge. We need knowledge to evolve and grow past our set narratives. Like machines we toil away at things, barely questioning, barely understanding. </p>

<p>But we must aim to learn more, see more. To escape the cataclysmic cycles, we must bite into that apple, and accept the pain that comes from it, because in that suffering, we see reality and then we can aim for more than what we have now.</p>

<p>Life is a balance of sorts and we need to accept that to grow and to exist, we must accept the good and the bad and persevere.</p>

<p>Without that perseverance, with just pipe dreams and tears, we will not have the strength to pull off the tasks we must complete to end this age and begin a new one. Accept the pain and find a way to exist and smile. Gain the power by gaining the knowledge, the true knowledge. It&#39;s there, in your memory, in your genes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the Anunnaki found the Earth, and it was a waste and a desolation.  Enki and Enlil were brothers, and their father was Anu.  </p>

<p>They found primitive humans here and Enki decided to give them intellect by genetically modifying them.  The other Anunnaki disagreed with this.  Enlil turned out to be the evil brother who sought to destroy and/or enslave Enki&#39;s creation.  This has been the battle ever since.  </p>

<p>The movie Prometheus is based on this concept.  So is 2001: A Space Odyssey.  </p>

<p>Have you watched William Cooper&#39;s Mystery Babylon?  </p>

<p>The first part of 2001: A Space Odyssey is the REAL Genesis story.  The one in the Bible is the corrupted version that is fed to the sheeple.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, you are the one who made the statement, so the burden is on you  to provide proof.  Enki and Elil are not in the Book of Enoch.  may I suggest modifying your original statement if you are unsure, your call though. After over a decade of research I find the original account of Adam and Eve to be true.  There was a walking, talking lizard like creature in the garden.  I believe the account if Enoch is correct as well, and it explains much</p>

<p>Also a worthwhile read, the Sumerian Mythos.</p>

<p>All is illusion, a test for the path of your soul.   They set up evil for fun and to &#39;show you what not to do&#39; and we fight it to prove our worth and serve others.   There are other ways to do this.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m certain a relationship with Jesus is needed also...  But it&#39;s an interesting worldview.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t take religious text stories too literally. They are often metaphorical or nonsensical.</p>

<p>The symbol of the snake comes from reptilian life forms in our galaxy. They have many common attributes with serpents. Yet, they do have legs and arms like others.</p>

<p>They are often a subversive element using their intelligence to manipulate others in order to serve themselves, not an inherently reptilian attribute. It gives them their reputation though.</p>

<p>Dont trust Lucifer, reptilians or any other foreign entities. They could all be self-serving, manipulating us into misery or ruin. We have to know them by their fruit.</p>

<p>Dispelling ignorance is not evil, unless it is done in a manipulative way, which is designed to funnel some kind of value to the manipulator. Truth can be used like a weapon on ignorant minds, by omitting relevant details. These beings are well known for such mischief as are their willing servants.</p>

<p>If you want to immunize yourself against manipulative beings like them abandon all dogma and the propensity for it. Dogma is trust of what authority said. Instead, reverse that principle. Never trust authority. Treat it as an equal. Make your own understanding the authority. Then you won&#39;t be willingly delegating your mind to another.</p>

<p>If you want to seek God, know that there is no God higher than the truth. God allows every measure of charlatans to fool you until you embrace the opposite of <em>dogma</em>, <em>amgod</em>. Then, you&#39;ll stop trying to give your mind to another&#39;s mind. How can you come back to Godhood as a mind slave? If you refuse to do this, the dark ones will abuse to until you do, or die trying. </p>

<p>God demands that we control ourselves. Those who refuse to do so fall to the fallen, who refuse to allow others to control themselves nor control themselves in relation to others&#39; self-interests. It&#39;s a path that says, fuck the principles of creation. I want it easy. Do the work for me. </p>

<p>We have a choice. </p>

<p>Self-control or be exploited?</p>

My videos are not religious and the speaker is agnostic. I dont want to waste my time on a naysayer anyways. Remain ignorant I dont care. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The heaven and earth are not everything. What about outer space? Galaxies? God doesn&#39;t create galaxies the closest he gets is when he puts the lights on the dome of the sky, to mark the seasons on earth. Lets just forget that a lot of those lights are clearly much older than the earth. Also the same hebrew word you&#39;re translating as &quot;heavens&quot; shamoyim is used to refer to the sky as in &quot;birds of the sky&quot; a few lines later. Sky, heaven, and outer space are three very different concepts, and there is no biblical hebrew word for universe because the concept didn&#39;t exist back then. All they knew about is the world. The ground and the sky, or as you&#39;d prefer to translate it heave and earth. You&#39;re the one who is being ignorant of the billions of galaxies we now know about thanks to science. </p>

<p>If you want to tell me god created this. Please point to chapter and verse:

    <div class="md"><p>I tried but I can&#39;t take this guy seriously. Seems like all he&#39;s doing is casting doubt on various scientific ideas which are all unproven as of yet anyway. I don&#39;t know how abiogensis occured but I do know that human beings are genetically related to every living thing on the planet earth. We are related to the entire biosphere which goes back 3.8 billion years. So is your explanation God made the first living thing and then natural selection took over. Or maybe natural selection is really God right because he controls nature. So over billions of years he could use the clouds and the sun and the temperature to breed different kinds of animals. Also if you don&#39;t believe in natural selection do you believe in artificial selection? Like do you think God created wolves, dalmations, corgis, etc, or do you accept that wolves evolved and then were artificially selected to form the various dog breeds?</p>

The amino acid can be seen as raw data and if you take raw data and place it in a cell that raw data can never self assimilate into a working program even if you give it an infinite amount of time it will never ever produce a working program. It would be like taking raw data and putting it in a computer shell and expecting it to create windows xp. It will never happen. Raw data will never assemble into a function, a script, a program, or any of those things cause you need a program to program the data. The only place you can take raw data and assemble it into a function is in the mind. You have to conceive of it before you can code it to do what you want it to do. Ask any programmer if raw data can self assimilate into any form of working program by accident and they will laugh at you. It cant be done no matter how much time you give it. A room full of monkeys given typewriters given infinity amount of time will never write Shakespeare. Our sciences are a shame and they don&#39;t have the heart to tell you.

    <div class="md"><p>You don’t think God would communicate on a level understandable to the created beings?  If He asks where they are, it’s for their benefit. They thought they could hide from Him. </p>

<p>God told Cain where his brother was, not the other way around. But, Cain did know his brother where his brother was —dead by his hand. </p>

<p>God said they would “surely die,” as in a mortal body and corrupted natural world that worked against them.  </p>

This is our test and burdens to become &quot;like gods&quot;. Like the cells in our body our spirit are like the cells of GOD himself. The bible says this. Our cells are made in our image as we are made in theirs. Take one cell and you can replicate me. If man can do this why not GOD. Jesus is GOD yet they can be the same and separate.
