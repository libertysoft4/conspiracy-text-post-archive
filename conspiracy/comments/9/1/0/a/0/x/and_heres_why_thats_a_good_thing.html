        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We see titles like this quite often in different forms of social media. </p>

<p>&quot;______ is here to stay, and here&#39;s why that&#39;s a good thing.&quot; or things such as &quot;__________ is happening and here&#39;s why that&#39;s a bad thing.&quot;</p>

<p>Titles like these have gotten my attention, but not for a good reason. It first started a while back when a Redditor posted a picture compiling different journalistic sources, showcasing that although there were almost 30 different sources, each followed a near identical article format... &quot;and here&#39;s why that&#39;s a good thing.&quot;</p>

<p>It was quite disturbing. I took to Google and simply searched, &quot;and here&#39;s why that&#39;s a good thing articles&quot;. When I clicked search, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=and+here&#x27;s+why+that&#x27;s+a+good+thing+articles&amp;amp;spell=1&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjRmuOBtbPcAhWhmuAKHdivAvQQBSgAegQIARAl&amp;amp;biw=1600&amp;amp;bih=777">countless articles with the same use of &quot;and heres why that&#39;s a good thing&quot;</a> showed up. </p>

<p>Hundreds and hundreds of articles all using the same sentence.... &quot;and here&#39;s why that&#39;s a good thing&quot;. Simple change good to bad and you find <a href="https://www.google.com/search?biw=1600&amp;amp;bih=777&amp;amp;ei=LNdUW4OYLYvr_AaOzqOYDw&amp;amp;q=and+here%27s+why+that%27s+a+bad+thing+articles&amp;amp;oq=and+here%27s+why+that%27s+a+bad+thing+articles&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i71k1l8.203614.203900.0.203979.3.3.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..3.0.0....0.dtBbxRP9ldk">countless articles from different sources all using the same format as well</a></p>

<p>At this point, I get to wondering. Why are they all using the same titles? It&#39;s almost as if they are instructing people how they should feel. Then it struck me. They ARE. </p>

<p>In a world where people are too busy to sit down and read a book. In a world where people can&#39;t even open up an article posted online, but simply read the title of the post and make their decision based on a single sentence without reading, the usage of short, condensed article headlines are being used to shape and mold peoples thoughts. </p>

<p>These articles, articles that say, &quot;and heres why that&#39;s a bad/good thing&quot; are instructing people how they should think instead of thinking for theirselves. Instead of saying, &quot;is that really a bad thing?&quot; and looking deeper into it, they simply read the title and agree with it. The titles, these sensational, exaggerated headlines are instructing people how to think. And its very dangerous. </p>

<p>These websites know people aren&#39;t going to sit down and really read the article, so they push as much emotion and information into the headline as possible and THATS what people make their decision based off of. That&#39;s what it seems like to me. </p>

<p>&quot;Trump did this and that&#39;s why its a bad thing.&quot; Is it? Is it really a bad thing? Did you even look up WHY it might be or did you just agree that its a bad thing because the headline told you its a bad thing.
I&#39;m just using Trump as an example since so many of the google articles revolve around his precedency. </p>

<p>In all, I think these &quot;and heres why that&#39;s a bad/good thing&quot; articles are dangerous and using the assumption that the American people are stupid. That they can be brainwashed. These articles are telling people how they should think and feel. Its very slimy and deceptive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>SS: My post says it all. Its dangerous, deceptive and slimy. </p>

<p>edit: to elaborate, this is merely an observation. my time surfing on reddit has somewhat really proved my post right, to a certain extent. often times posts are submitted to reddit with ridiculous, sensational, emotion filled titles, and when you turn to the comment section, people often say &quot;did anyone even read the article? the title isn&#39;t true&quot; meanwhile the post, with an untrue sensational title sits at more than 8,000 upvotes while the top comment saying the title isn&#39;t even true is barley seen. </p>

<p>Once again, I believe these &quot;...and here&#39;s why that&#39;s a bad/good thing&quot; articles are used to tell people how to think about something. &quot;We believe this is a bad thing, so you should believe it too&quot; are what these headlines translate into. Reddit is a hotbed for &#39;sheep&#39; people who just follow along and don&#39;t question or look into things for themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also look into Google News new format. Prior to updating the layout (about 7 months ago), Google news was an aggregate with small boxes covering the entire screen, all filled with various news articles from different sources. Then they change layout and now it’s only one tiny column in the center and all articles originate from 8 or 9 pro establishment mouth pieces. Also notice how they word the titles, so as you scroll down the list and scan through the titles, subcinsciously, you are being implanted with the exact outlook they want you to have. You think it’s a trustworthy news source because they are always feeding you articles that relate to your interests, but what you don’t know is they are controlling the conversation so overtime they can slowly nudge you towards a pro establishment outlook.</p>

<p>&quot;Assumption?!!&quot; No, it&#39;s a known fact that Americans can be brainwashed, that&#39;s the whole basis of advertising and marketing. So of course Google and FB and every other corporate media outlet is going to incorporate that fact into their business plans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think theres really any conspiracy to it, exactly.</p>

<p>By adding that phrase, it catches people&#39;s attention faster. Say the king of pizza town just imposed a tax on cheese. People out of the loop might not know what that means for them, the potential effects, etc.</p>

<p>By adding that phrase it&#39;ll give them a quick rundown.</p>

<p>Lets say theres another city, Focaccia town (The likely origin of Pizza fyi) is on the other side of the spectrum, they&#39;ll put their spin on the even and tell you why its bad, from their point of view.</p>

<p>If you know which side the news outlet leans towards, you kinda understand why they think such and such event is good or bad.</p>

<p>TLDR: Its an attention grabbing phrase and news outlets are businesses too, they need people to read their news to make money. Adding that phrase is a sure fire way to keep people&#39;s attention since its basically the &quot;ELI5 version&quot; of news.</p>

<p>Take a good long look around. Ask yourself why the giants of the old are under such pressure and what was necessary that a clickbait-website like HuffPo could compete with the NYT. </p>

<p>And than go a step further and ask yourself why there is always the complaint about MSM without even trying to find the difference between e.g. the guardian and Fox news. Not politically but from a qualitative POV.</p>
