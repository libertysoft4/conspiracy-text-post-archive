    <div class="md"><p>As any vaxxer will say, since you aren’t a doctor, you’re stupid, your opinion doesn’t matter, you should get no say in what medical practices occur to your children, and you should probably face child abuse charges for even <em>thinking</em> of questioning doctors and “experts” in the subject.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you are a doctor or an expert and you question the vaccine schedule, then vaxxer think you should have your medical license revoked and you should possibly face jail time.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you do have proof, then we’ll, Penn &amp; Teller said you’re full of bullshit, and since I believe magicians over science, I’ll say that you’re full of bullshit to.</p>

<p>For vaxxers, it’s fingers in the ears and “la la la la la bullshit!” all day long. There is literally no line of debate they can’t create a circular argument around to justify their lack of critical thinking skills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Youre seem standoffish and angry but please try to keep up.  Lets recap:</p>

<p>Someone posted detailing the thought process behind their anti-vaxx position, which included the questioning of authority.  To which you replied:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hope you&#39;ll never have children, and die of a disease transmitted from someone who wasn&#39;t vaccinated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So clearly you are pro-vaccine based on that reaction. But you then go on to mention how people shouldnt blindly trust everything, yet often times it is <em>because</em> anti-vaxxers <em>dont</em> blindly trust everything, that they are anti-vaxx in the first place.  </p>

<p>I think you may be asking the wrong person, telling you the ingredients in stuff isn&#39;t a doctor&#39;s job, any more than a waiter&#39;s job is to know and tell you exactly what is in your food.</p>

<p>Surely someone knows, but it might be difficult to find out who it is and convince them that it&#39;s worth their time to talk to you.</p>

<p>Seems to me that if that is, in fact, difficult, that&#39;s a pretty legitimate complaint about this system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is possible you are seeing more ads because not vaccinating is becoming a bigger issue.  The city I live outside of recently reported a story about a particularly granola school where I think 80%? of the kids were not vaccinated (it was a large percentage).  Wherever one stands on an issue, that creates a larger community concern for sure.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I completely agree with you.  I vaccinated my kids but on a delayed schedule because I wasn&#39;t comfortable with the hit to their immune system and resulting high fevers that happened with my first kid.  My doctor was fine with it as long as they weren&#39;t in school/daycare.  It required special treatment, as the vaccines typically come together, but again, my doctor was fine as long as it happened before the kids entered school.  Seemed like a fair compromise to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re conditioning people to get very upset about someone that thinks for themselves. I agree with you. When they achieve that (and they will) we will become human test subjects. Really, we already are. It wouldn&#39;t be difficult to replace a vaccination with a retro virus that mutates our DNA, or creating a plague that certain select people were given an immunity against. Every day I realize more that human beings who are susceptible to all of the manipulation in their lives, are disconnected from their conscience and instead use their minds to rationalize their thoughts, ideas, and  concepts. Those humans are capable of any evil. </p>

<p>Combine that with giving a foreign entity the right to place anything they want inside your body and you have yet another option for the eventual end of our species.</p>

<p>What if the cycle of human development on earth is stopped simply because one man or woman felt that they couldn&#39;t break their own cycle and rationalized that ending it for everyone was somehow necessary to save us? Jim Jones much? I wouldn&#39;t want the most benevolent human in the world to have the power to affect the biological operations of my body without my consent.</p>

<p>The individual MUST be the gate in order to defend themselves against tyranny. If we can perceive a control that can be used against us, the logical conclusion is that it will, inevitably, be used against us. Look at the logical progression of tyranny in this country&#39;s or nearly any other country&#39;s history. It all starts with a promise to be protected from the tyrants in the world and ends with you realizing the protectors were the tyrants all along and they used your support to protect themselves against you when the truth is discovered. Me? I believe in defense against evil, not protection from it. We are literally less safe because of our government. Through government, we have created more evil than ever existed in the world. When/If you shed your fear, you will see this is the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They need to have 100% people vaccinated. Not 99%, not even 99.5%. When every single person is vaccinated, you can no longer question the benefits of vaccine, because there is no one who grew up without vaccine. Pediatricians can no longer say &quot;unvax kids are much healthier than vaxed kids&quot;. When they tell you measles numbers have dropped dramatically, you can no longer question it. </p>

<p>So the next step is to mandate vaccination indeed, not to reach &quot;herd immunity&quot;, but to avoid a few people escape the matrix, and do it most likely healthy.</p>

Some simply question the number of vaccines, the need for vaccinations for STDs for babies, or simply want to delay the vaccines until the child is a bit older. Labeling any of those people as an “anti-vaxxer” shuts down all conversation as they are automatically lumped in with Jenny McCarthy and a whole slew of irrational Facebook moms who did “research”. </p>
