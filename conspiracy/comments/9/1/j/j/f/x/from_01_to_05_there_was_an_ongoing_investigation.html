        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><h1>Guess who was transferred in to the Internal Revenue Service to run the Tax Exemption Branch of the IRS?</h1>

<p>Lois Lerner.</p>

<p>Now, that’s interesting, isn’t it?</p>

<p>It gets better, well not really, but this is all just a series of strange coincidences, right?</p>

<h1>Guess who ran the Tax Division inside the Department of Injustice from 2001 to 2005?</h1>

<p>None other than the Assistant Attorney General of the United States, Rod Rosenstein.</p>

<p>Now, that’s interesting, isn’t it?</p>

<h1>Guess who was the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation during this time frame?</h1>

<p>I know, it’s a miracle, just a coincidence, just an anomaly in statistics and chances, <strong>Robert Mueller.</strong></p>

<p>What do all four casting characters have in common?</p>

<p>They all were briefed and/or were front line investigators into the Clinton Foundation Investigation.</p>

<p>Now that’s just a coincidence, right?</p>

<p>Ok, lets chalk the last one up to mere chance.</p>

<p>Let’s fast forward to 2009.</p>

<p>James Comey leaves the Justice Department to go and cash-in at Lockheed Martin.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton is running the State Department, on her own personal email server by the way.</p>

<p>The Uranium One “issue” comes to the attention of the Hillary.</p>

<p>Like all good public servants do, you know looking out for America’s best interest, she decides to support the decision and approve the sale of 20% of US Uranium to none other than, the Russians.</p>

<p>Now you would think that this is a fairly straight up deal, except it wasn’t, the People got absolutely nothing out of it.</p>

<p>However, prior to the sales approval, none other than Bill Clinton goes to Moscow, gets paid $500 K for a one-hour speech then meets with Vladimir Putin at his home for a few hours.</p>

<p>Ok, no big deal, right?</p>

<p>Well, not so fast, the FBI had a mole inside the money laundering and bribery scheme.</p>

<h1>Guess who was the FBI Director during this timeframe?</h1>

<p>Yep, Robert Mueller.</p>

<p>He even delivered a Uranium Sample to Moscow in 2009.</p>

<h1>Guess who was handling that case within the Justice Department out of the US Attorney’s Office in Maryland.</h1>

<h1>None other than, yup, Rod Rosenstein.</h1>

<h1>Guess what happened to the informant?</h1>

<p>The Department of Justice placed a GAG order on him and threatened to lock him up if he spoke out about it.</p>

<p>How does 20% of the most strategic asset of the United States of America end up in Russian hands when the FBI has an informant, a mole providing inside information to the FBI on the criminal enterprise?</p>

<h1>Guess what happened soon after the sale was approved?</h1>

<p>145 million dollars in “donations” made their way into the Clinton Foundation from entities directly connected to the Uranium One deal.</p>

<h1>Guess who was still at the Internal Revenue Service working the Charitable Division?</h1>

<p>None other than, you got it. Lois Lerner.</p>

<p>Ok, that’s all just another series of coincidences, nothing to see here, right?</p>

<p>Let’s fast forward to 2015.</p>

<p>Due to a series of tragic events in Benghazi and after the 9 “investigations” the House, Senate and at State Department, Trey Gowdy who was running the 10th investigation as Chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi, discovers that the Hillary ran the State Department on an unclassified, unauthorized, outlaw personal email server.</p>

<p>He also discovered that none of those emails had been turned over when she departed her “Public Service” as Secretary of State which was required by law.</p>

<p>He also discovered that there was Top Secret information contained within her personally archived email.</p>

<p>Sparing you the State Departments cover up, the nostrums they floated, the delay tactics that were employed and the outright lies that were spewed forth from the necks of the Kerry State Department, we shall leave it with this…… they did everything humanly possible to cover for Hillary.</p>

<h1>Now this is amazing, guess who became FBI Director in 2013?</h1>

<p>Guess who secured 17 no bid contracts for his employer (Lockheed Martin) with the State Department and was rewarded with a six million dollar thank you present when he departed his employer.</p>

<p><strong>None other than our pal, James Comey.</strong></p>

<p>Amazing how all those no-bids just went right through at State, huh?</p>

<p>Now he, of course, is the FBI Director in charge of the “Clinton Email Investigation” (after, of course, his FBI Investigates the Lois Lerner “Matter” at the Internal Revenue Service and, of course, exonerates her).</p>

<p>Nope couldn’t find any crimes there.</p>

<h1>Can you guess what happened next?</h1>

<p>In April 2016, James Comey drafts an exoneration letter of Hillary Rodham Clinton, meanwhile the DOJ is handing out immunity deals like candy.</p>

<p>They didn’t even convene a Grand Jury.</p>

<p>Like a lightning bolt of statistical impossibility, like a miracle from God himself, like the true “Gangsta” Homey is, James steps out into the cameras of an awaiting press conference on July the 8th of 2016 and exonerates the Hillary from any wrongdoing.</p>

<h1>Can you see the pattern?</h1>

<p>It goes on and on, Rosenstein becomes Asst. Attorney General, Comey gets fired based upon a letter by Rosenstein, Comey leaks government information to the press, Mueller is assigned to the Russian Investigation sham by Rosenstein to provide cover for decades of malfeasance within the FBI and DOJ and the story continues.</p>

<p>FISA abuse, political espionage…. pick a crime, any crime, chances are…… this group and a few others were deeply involved in it.</p>

<p>All the same players.</p>

<p>All compromised and conflicted.</p>

<p>All working fervently to NOT go to jail themselves.</p>

<p>All connected in one way or another to the Clintons.</p>

<p>They are like battery acid, they corrode and corrupt everything they touch.</p>

<p>How many lives have these two destroyed?</p>

<p>As of this writing, the Clinton Foundation, in its 20+ years of operation of being the largest International Charity Fraud in the history of mankind, has never been audited by the Internal Revenue Service.</p>

<p>Let us not forget that Comey’s brother works for DLA Piper, the law firm that does the Clinton Foundation’s taxes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re trying to say that George W. Bush and his Republican appointees under his government were protecting Hillary Clinton?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a more obvious idea. They didn&#39;t find anything, and now some Republicans are having a problem with the totally lawless Donald Trump going after them personally.</p>

<p>Maybe you missed it but the Clintons were investigated nonstop throughout the nineties once Republicans took the Congress and got Fox News on the air. Little has stuck.</p>

<p>Now we have the biggest criminal in American history to ever occupy the White House and all the Republican partisans masquerading as &quot;independent&quot; Donald Trump supporters can do is yell that everyone&#39;s out to get the dear leader. Meanwhile, there are a dozen or more DJT officials deep in bed with Russian oligarchs -- and worse yet in with the libertarian deconstruction team right here in the United States -- looking to tear down America from its roots and send us back to the days of scrip and company barracks. Deregulation everyone! :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, it&#39;s definitely not the one that is being used to hide the other. This post suggesting that top government officials all knew each other and therefore they were all secretly on Hillary&#39;s side is absurd. Guess what dude? Top officials in a two-party system all know each other. They are all connected. Sure, sometimes there are conspiracies, but sometimes there are not. This submission is wild speculation for the specific purpose of protecting TPTB which happens to be entirely Republicans right now. This is the opposite of the two decades of internet conspiracy coverage before 2016. Conspiracies should not protect TPTB. </p>

<p>The assertions of this vociferous submitter who attacks the opposition of the TPTB or supports TPTB every time mean nothing. If I read all the fake charges made by people on the internet, I wouldn&#39;t be doing anything else. Go read some real information. </p>

<p>Just today, I read extensively how Donald Trump&#39;s commerce secretary is all caught up in a Russian bank and his son lent money to Donald Trump. I also read up on the new Donald Trump regulation cutting off veteran coverage as he&#39;s off in St. Louis bragging about how it will help. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why does this &quot;sold 20% of us uranium&quot; propaganda keep being used? It&#39;s a Canadian company. Buying 20% of the company does not mean Russians own it.  There are several corporation involved in mining in the USA. So it&#39;s not even near 20% of US uranium. Owning 20% of the corporation does not mean they can import it. And lastly why does it matter? Both countries have access to more then enough uranium.... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So basically your saying that two life long Republicans have for some reason decided to turn on the party and engage in a Democrat conspiracy. Mueller race his first political appointment from Ronald Reagan, while Comey received his from Bush 41. Additionally, Comey served as assistant to Kenneth Star in the Whitewater investigations. Federal laws governing private foundations are fairly lax, which has more to do w likelihood Clinton&#39;s actions have not been found illegal. As long as donors are complaining, and the foundation is abiding by tax laws, there really isn&#39;t a basis for allegations of wrongdoing. Further, considering the money they make from speeches, books, and other sources, it&#39;s hard to believe they are hurting for money. In fact, the Clinton&#39;s, who unlike some other politicians released their tax records. Those records show that Clinton&#39;s had a significant income from books, speeches, and investment. It seems that if Dems were going to engage in a conspiracy like this, they would have employed individuals who lives were not spent in service to the GOP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So all of this was just to get Trump elected over Clinton? Crazy.</p>

<p>All of that control, Russian influence, money, and power, and Clinton just handed the Presidency to Trump by not showing up in a few key districts.</p>

<p>How deep does this rabbit hole go? Why would &quot;Hillary&quot; allow Trump to become President? Why would she allow Trump to borrow money in the 90s and early 00s from Russian mob members? Why does she allow Trump to use a non secure phone for Twitter? Why did Hilary allow Trump to hire Cohen as his lawyer, the same lawyer who works for Hannity? Why would she give up being the first female President so Trump can golf 1/3 of his Presidency?</p>

<p>Clinton has so much power I just don&#39;t understand why she&#39;d allow OP to use 14 different font sizes</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, lot to cover there OP so I kinda feel like a jerk pointing out one I think you missed.</p>

<p>Guess who was the investigator who cleared Bill Clinton in the Marc Rich investigation? Where Bill Clinton handed out a pardon to the guy responsible for the biggest money laundering case in US history, after millions went through back door channels and were funneled into the Clinton Foundation, the Clinton library and the DNC (for later use in someone&#39;s Senate run?)
 Yeah that would be James Comey. But his boss Eric Holder said it was all legit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I got another one.
How about the HSBC case that was so big it supersedes the Marc Rich for biggest money laundering/tax evasion case. HSBC was using a Swiss subsidiary to launder cash for &#39;special&#39; clients, narcotics traffickers, terrorist groups and 3rd world dictators stealing state cash.
 The NY federal prosecutor, Loretta Lynch didn&#39;t feel it was even nessasary to interview the whistleblower who exposed the case. No one was prosecuted, HSBC never even admitted guilt. Lynch&#39;s boss, Eric Holder said he was happy with the way she handled the case.</p>
