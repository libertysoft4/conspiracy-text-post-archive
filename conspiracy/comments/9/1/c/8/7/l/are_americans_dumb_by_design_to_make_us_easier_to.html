        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Compared to other developed nations we suck when it comes to education. How is that even possible unless it’s intentional? And now with this common core crap they’re pushing now parents are struggling to help even their  extremely young children because it’s so confusing and foreign to how they were taught. This isn’t just happening in black and immigrant areas it’s nationwide. The more affluent areas can afford tutors and extra help so their kids do well. So if the US. spends so much on education why are we lagging behind all the other developed nations? My theory is that it’s easier to control a population that is essentially dumb, don’t read, and prefer to get their news and information off social media and news programs. This way they can be told what to think instead of forming their own opinions </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We already pay our laborers far above the industry standard. It’s how we’ve managed to acquire the talent we already have. It’s the lack of potential workers to even offer a higher salary to that is the problem. Short of poaching people from other companies, the only candidates we managed to find has mostly been shit heads. </p>

<p>Trust me when I say, we’re more than willing to pay more. If it were that simple, I wouldn’t be saying it’s a problem.</p>

<p>Before the days of ridiculous student loans being given to every person that can afford college, many intelligent people went into the trades because they simply couldn’t afford college. Now, they push <em>everyone</em> to go to college, whether you can afford it or not. The only ones going to trade schools it seems are the ones that their teachers feel “aren’t cut out for college”. </p>

<p>That’s the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s bullshit. I say this as a non college graduate who does trade work and has a college age child.</p>

<p>If you advertise good pay rates you will get good people. The problem is that companies think $25/hr is a good pay rate when their charging $80-200/hr for the techs.</p>

<p>20 - 30 years ago when $25/hr could support a family they would also train and apprentice people. Now they expect the employee to pay $50k for some bullshit for-profit tech school and still make the same money after graduation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;d have to look into the root causes of poor education. Money is probably sitting comfortably at top; our schools are woefully under-funded compared to other developed nations. I&#39;m not sure how you&#39;d link that to poor intentions rather than mismanagement (not that I&#39;m saying it rules it out).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2012/06/21/how-texas-inflicts-bad-textbooks-on-us/">https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2012/06/21/how-texas-inflicts-bad-textbooks-on-us/</a>
This speaks for itself.</p>

<p>Another factor would be teachers themselves. Most public school teachers are salaried at less than $50k/year, and that $50k mark is rarely obtainable. <a href="https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/">Here&#39;s an interesting take on the correlation between productivity and wages. </a></p>

<p>You&#39;d have to make the argument that a dumb nation is a more obedient one, as well. How much correlation is there between complacency and lower educational standards? Historically, the less-educated were largely responsible for revolutions and revolts. Slaves, serfs, working class, etc are the ones always kept down, but they&#39;re typically the ones that rise up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was when there was just the very rich vs the very poor. But here we have blacks at the bottom, with not enough numbers to do an uprising. Then you have poor white who have been pitted against blacks and the rich. Then you have Republicans vs Democrats. And within each group there are divisions. In actuality it’s still just the rich controlling everything and pitting everyone against each other.  And now unfortunately this whole socialist movement is gathering steam - just further divisions. And no matter who is running the country or what policies are enacted the rich just keep getting richer.

What every one in the rest of this country has forgotten is when a man asks fr help you help him and you dont ask for help untill you cant do it alone. This is how my town lives. </p>

<p>I asked a man for help once when I was not able to make it on my own, he gave me what I asked for and a bit more. I offered to pay him back once and he said if I ever try give him money again we would have a problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uhm, I was pretty insync with other kids? Not totally sure what you mean by &quot;culture weaponry&quot;?  The main differences for me were that I was a bit more advanced (like algebra 2 and college-level reading comprehension in 8th grade), and I didn&#39;t put up with petty bs and I think I was a bit more mature/didn&#39;t get pulled into drama. </p>

<p>Otherwise, unless the parent is totally hick/extreme amish/incompetent, Homeschooled kids are very well socialized and get on great with &quot;normal kids&quot;. I watched Spongebob, Avatar the last airbender, and current-at-the-time movies; read lots of books (including Harry Potter, Percy Jackson and other popular books); surfed the internet a lot; played with local kids and made friends easily. My mom never kept or sheltered me from &quot;current culture&quot;, she did have a thing against anime for awhile though (tbf though Sailor Moon has a lot of sexual stuff in it, just my misfortune that she roped Pokemon into it too). But usually my parents enjoyed consuming media with me; and my mom did things like reading Harry Potter (during that church scare of &quot;OMG IT TEACHES DEMONIC WITCHCRAFT&quot;) then buying me all the books when she realized that church-claim was bs. </p>

<p>My husband, who was also homeschooled (but never went to public school), had more sheltering parents...although he did things like sneaking to the library to read Harry Potter :) but he is totally normal besides his immeasurable love of books. We&#39;re just working on catching him up on the classics (shows and movies) so he can understand <em>all the references</em>. Oh, and after we got together I got him hooked on video games, so that&#39;s fun :) </p>

<p>Also, a bit ranty here: the &quot;oh he can&#39;t talk because he was homeschooled&quot;-idea is <em>so wrong</em>, I&#39;ve met so many other homeschooled kids and never met one that was socially inept (unless like I said before the parents were awful or trashy). Granted, I think people saw me as weirdly quiet but honestly, I was more bemused by my high school friends and was more intent on listening to them talk about themselves rather than talking about me.  I also did/do get on better with mature people, I was an only child for 11 years and most of my company during my childhood was adults. They were fun adults, and I did play a lot with other kids my age, but I&#39;ve also been told I was a pretty low-matience/chill child. </p>

<p>The only thing that really startled me when I did start to go to public school was how mean kids in high school could be. That was a bit shocking, but for the most part it just rolled off me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the great reply. By &quot;culture weaponry&quot; I mean that sea of western culture that, in essence, programs the mind&#39;s operating system without us realizing it -- our views towards sex, towards family, towards values, shopping choices, etc. These things are engineered, not accidental. (There is an existential crisis to be had here...) Probably unavoidable living in the west, but hopefully mitigated somewhat by homeschooling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh gotcha, sorry I totally misunderstood I think. My family is Christian (the philosophical kind that loves books, not the fanatical get-out-and-preach-AT-people kind, although we think everyone should know about Christianity because it&#39;s pretty sweet), so I was raised on mostly <a href="https://www.sonlight.com">the Sonlight Cirrculum</a>; my mom had swapped out a few books because they were super boring, with more historically accurate and engaging books, and also went totally to <a href="http://www.singaporemath.com/Default.asp?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqPTq7va33AIVR57ACh2i_A_UEAAYAiAAEgLamPD_BwE">Singapore Math</a>, which is arguably the best math. </p>

<p><strong>The rest is more in-depth but here&#39;s the TL;DR:</strong> Unfortunately we mostly fall in line with current westernism, besides maybe slightly our views on sex (the partner is NOT disposable, no Wal-Mart relationships), morals (classical conservative christian), and Family (ours is all tight-knit, nearly zero drama). Consumerism for us is within our means, but we both still findourselves saying &quot;I need it&quot;, for something we very much don&#39;t need.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Shopping-wise I think we were/are pretty consistent with modern consumerism, which is a good and bad thing, but my parents were never in debt and taught me how to be reasonably fiscally responsible. My husband&#39;s family <em>only</em> really buy things they need, kids got chocolates for christmas and only a few presents each birthday (they&#39;re also Canadian too, which I think affected them more).</p>

<p>Sex ed was awkward af, I&#39;m pretty sure besides knowing it&#39;s good thing to wait, being taught it&#39;s a gift from God to enjoy and enjoy your spouse, and the anatomy/general functions (she taught it to me before I cared, which I&#39;m thankful for), my parents essentially gave me a pamphlet 😂 I ended up taking sex ed again in public school (where I found out half my class thought I was a lesbian?). And a Human Sexuality course in college which I&#39;m very glad I took (it was more the psychology of sex and of sexual orientations, very insiteful, I think my prof knew and wanted to deter future incels too, so that was pretty cool). My husband&#39;s family did basically the same thing, but insted of a pamphlet they got a &quot;the talk&quot;, and younger kids, my husband included, got more info from older siblings.</p>

<p>My family almost never had drama, and we were/are very tight-knit. My immediate family almost always ate dinner together at the table, later we started eating sometimes on the couch with a movie on, but even now it&#39;s usually at a table. Lots of talking, lots of jokes, even when it was just the three of us.</p>

<p>I think my morals almost all line up with Christian/historical ones. I&#39;m not afraid to break the rules or not follow instructions if I feel my moral compass leading another way or am concerned that someone (or an animal) will get hurt. I did not go through the rigorous obedience-without-question/beaten-down training that I noticed a lot in public school. But, I&#39;m also a pretty docile person in nature so I never really got punished either.</p>

<p>My husband is obedient to a fault to his father though, but also very fiery and headstrong, and <em>usually</em> very moral (though less concerned about general safety or up-keep on health, and sometimes we have surprising talks where he can&#39;t answer why one thing is more moral than another, he&#39;s learning though). He does very much stand up for what he believes in, whereas I usually only do so to prevent people getting hurt (or if someone is being intentionally ignorant about science things), so his adamance and my laxness tend to balance eachother out. Different people and parents though moreso than different outcomes of being homeschooled, I think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back in the 1960s we had the best education system on the planet.</p>

<p>And then all those children went off to College or work or if young and male and not incollege to the Vietnam War. </p>

<p>The protests begun by the educated compassionate young people then proceeded to stand up to the elders.  </p>

<p>We know it didn&#39;t go well for the powerful for a while but they pushed back so hard and here and yes.  Education was the first target of the undoing of intelligent knowledgeable ordinary citizens. </p>

<p>Education is to be reserved for the children of the upper classes only.</p>

<p>Betsy DeVos is working hard to get to that goal. Poor children will be segregated by law, not by accident of neighborhood. Those children will be trained for servant like work that can&#39;t be done with robots. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My aunt and mom are very involved in the school system (both previously teachers/aids). In our local school system there used to be surplus of $150,000 dollars/year to help cover general school costs, and especially to help the special needs classes/teachers/students. It was amazing, everyone got what they needed <em>and still had a surplus</em>. Then, about 5 years ago all that money disappeared, there was a ~$45,000 deficit and they had to lay off people (mostly from the special needs department, honestly where they&#39;re needed most so they could keep up &quot;appearances&quot; for everyone else). </p>

<p>This all consisted with a new principal and one or two new heads of board for the school system. So, I&#39;m assuming a lot of this this shitty school stuff is because of &quot;leaks&quot; and people being shitty and greedy.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also more politics in what and how things get taught than actual logic or research; one of the reasons standardized tests are still a norm is because it makes it easier for charter schools to get money (read: businesses that get government money &quot;for the kids&quot; then run the school as cheaply as possible to make as much profit as possible. They&#39;re literally using kids, running them for &quot;good scores&quot; to make money. It&#39;s horrible).</p>

<p>My aunt who worked in Washington for awhile under a school board there has a mini-rant about CC too, I don&#39;t remember most of it, but she said it failed most &quot;checkmarks&quot; for what&#39;s usually a good school curriculum and passed anyway because some mega-plotical power wanted to seem like it was &quot;doing something&quot;, &quot;for the kids&quot;.</p>

<p>Tbh though, CC isn&#39;t always totally horrible either. It&#39;s gotten a lot better: its main philosophy is to teach the same math ideas several different ways so kids basically get acquainted with number theories at a young age. However, I don&#39;t think that should be classroom standard, I think that should be a separate class or tutoring hour thing. Some kids think differently but most are okay with the standard way of teaching. </p>

<p>The main change we should be fighting for is to get rid of standardized testing. Prepare the kids for real life problems, not for A B C or D.</p>

Not a scientist but to me I would say it might be greatly affected by pollution.  It doesn’t help that they allow so many known toxic substances into the marketplace and in our foods.</p>

<p>I know that they claim that a huge risk factor is the age of the father and the industry he’s in but men and women used to have kids at an older age all the time before birth control. Maybe it’s because as you age now there’s a buildup of the toxins in your system or something </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Related to this is the huge prevalence of circumcision in the US which has been proven to permanently alter the brain when done on newborns without anaesthesia (the usual procedure). </p>

<p>I theorize that this causes males to become increasingly sociopathic and lean towards right-wing/neo-con/libertarian tendencies and authoritarianism as well as becoming increasingly materialistic and obsessed with status symbols and money etc. </p>

<p>Of course women are not circumcised, but they naturally don&#39;t have a tendency to lead anyway so their less sociopathic tendencies don&#39;t manifest much in the workplace.</p>

<p>So the result is increasingly sociopathic leadership in companies, an increasingly materialistic outlook, neo-con takeover etc. This all fits well with the Zionists who are also all circumcised (and fit the old  stereotype of money-grubbing jews).</p>

<p>It also fits in with places like Somalia, where most/many are circumcised and this place is a chaos of basically libertarianism.</p>

I don’t see how circumcised penises lead to being right-wing. Actually when you look at these people it’s easy to see how they get reeled in. They have a short list of things they care  about, they have a strong cause to fight for- God &amp; Country,  and these themes are constantly drilled into them through Fox News , breitbart, fb groups and friends that support them . Look at r/the_donald anyone who says anything the least critical of trump is immediately booted. These ppl r so insulated in this bubble that of course they think anyone who says something counter to what they hear is a liar.

    <div class="md"><p>If circumcision <a href="http://circumcision.org/circumcision-permanently-alters-the-brain/">permanently alters the brain</a> then it follows that <em>most</em> of the US male population can probably be diagnosed with some kind of psychological issue relating to this. </p>

<p>&quot;A neurologist who saw the results postulated that the data indicated that circumcision affected most intensely the portions of the victim’s brain associated with reasoning, perception and emotions. &quot;</p>

<p>F.ex. a lack of emotions is related to sociopathy, i.e. not being able to emphasize. For business (i.e. money) you need to control emotions. </p>

<p>This is just speculation of course. But as an outsider what I notice is that the US is the most materialistic in the world, putting a monetary value on literally <em>everything</em> (e.g. you want justice? sure just buy this really expensive lawyer. You want to be cured of a perfectly curable, but deadly, disease? sure, just pay this massive bill putting you into debt forever (don&#39;t have a house to mortgage? tough luck, you&#39;re dead)).<br/>
At the same time we have the image of the money-grubbing zionist. Incl. the other examples and tie-ins I gave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now that I&#39;m grown up a bit, I definitely have the view that you&#39;re the exception if you&#39;re NOT dumb. There&#39;s a lot of smart (not dumb) people, but man do the dummies outnumber them.</p>

<p>Sensationalist/click bait headlines and articles, school textbooks being a monopoly, the shit our media pours down yuong peoples throats, and shit even our FOOD, it all adds to it, and I&#39;m sure there are tons of things I can list. It&#39;s not just a lack of money in the education system - our entire country is setup to limit you unless you either cheat or play the game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and I think that is a big part of why they&#39;re intent on  transforming the internet into a propoganda machine. Not only does the internet allow us to communicate and coordinate with each other, it allows us to self-educate.</p>

<p>It&#39;s scary how much power they had to control the narrative before the internet. 20 years ago there would be no push back to the Russiagate narrative, it would be unquestionably accepted as fact by virtually the whole world. They want that power back, desperately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the educational system is designed to fail children.  There are several other factors too: </p>

<li>fluoride in drinking water</li>

<li>controlled media</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a public school teacher and this seriously seems to be the case.  It&#39;s very frustrating.  A scary majority of kids are lacking in basic skills (like being able to identify continents, continents, and cities on a map).  It&#39;s depressing to see everyday.  The reading levels of my students are way way way below their grade level.  Very few of the sixth graders I teach can read at a sixth grade level.  It&#39;s considered good if they are only 2 levels behind (but MANY are much farther behind than that).  Spelling, grammar, and handwriting aren&#39;t even taught anymore.  It feels pretty hopeless to be honest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uhm, I was pretty insync with other kids? Not totally sure what you mean by &quot;culture weaponry&quot;?  The main differences for me were that I was a bit more advanced (like algebra 2 and college-level reading comprehension in 8th grade), and I didn&#39;t put up with petty bs and I think I was a bit more mature/didn&#39;t get pulled into drama. </p>

<p>Otherwise, unless the parent is totally hick/extreme amish/incompetent, Homeschooled kids are very well socialized and get on great with &quot;normal kids&quot;. I watched Spongebob, Avatar the last airbender, and current-at-the-time movies; read lots of books (including Harry Potter, Percy Jackson and other popular books); surfed the internet a lot; played with local kids and made friends easily. My mom never kept or sheltered me from &quot;current culture&quot;, she did have a thing against anime for awhile though (tbf though Sailor Moon has a lot of sexual stuff in it, just my misfortune that she roped Pokemon into it too). But usually my parents enjoyed consuming media with me; and my mom did things like reading Harry Potter (during that church scare of &quot;OMG IT TEACHES DEMONIC WITCHCRAFT&quot;) then buying me all the books when she realized that church-claim was bs. </p>

<p>My husband, who was also homeschooled (but never went to public school), had more sheltering parents...although he did things like sneaking to the library to read Harry Potter :) but he is totally normal besides his immeasurable love of books. We&#39;re just working on catching him up on the classics (shows and movies) so he can understand <em>all the references</em>. Oh, and after we got together I got him hooked on video games, so that&#39;s fun :) </p>

<p>Also, a bit ranty here: the &quot;oh he can&#39;t talk because he was homeschooled&quot;-idea is <em>so wrong</em>, I&#39;ve met so many other homeschooled kids and never met one that was socially inept (unless like I said before the parents were awful or trashy). Granted, I think people saw me as weirdly quiet but honestly, I was more bemused by my high school friends and was more intent on listening to them talk about themselves rather than talking about me.  I also did/do get on better with mature people, I was an only child for 11 years and most of my company during my childhood was adults. They were fun adults, and I did play a lot with other kids my age, but I&#39;ve also been told I was a pretty low-matience/chill child. </p>

<p>The only thing that really startled me when I did start to go to public school was how mean kids in high school could be. That was a bit shocking, but for the most part it just rolled off me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not too different from myself, although I went secular humanist after getting out of the home. (I&#39;m a homebrew flavor of Christian now.) I imagine there&#39;s a science to developing a MindOS (culture) that is able to interface with popular culture without the downsides.</p>
