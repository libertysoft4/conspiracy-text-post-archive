Modern Americans are very, very easily programmable and very very stupid.

<p>I suspect it will go much like the riots in MO except wide spread, as the Zionist media whips their libdrones into a righteous fury at da patriarchy or da raycis or some other bullshit they invented, while they use the Rigtwing conserdrones to create an immovable object for them to strike against.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll see large scale rioting, massive civil unrest, but nowhere will you see what needs to happen.</p>

<p>Wall Street, LA, DC and New York will remain intact, Zion will maintain total control over the government and media, and will profit from all of it as these morons destroy themselves.  </p>

<p>Which social improvements have we passed lately? By all means, let them sift for every tax-break they can get, as long as we actually increase the baseline tax rate for people making ludicrously high amounts of money (or, more honestly, just start taxing capital/wealth rather than income). </p>

Rather, the poisonous first extraction, the &quot;elite&quot; as they are termed, like methanol should be disposed of, sequestered, or used <em>themselves</em> for our greater benefit as even methanol is useful as long it is not ingested, it can be burned or used as a solvent.</p>

<p>Eating healthy isn&#39;t as expensive as you think but there is lots of time spent- which you&#39;re absolutely right, many simply don&#39;t have because they&#39;re attempting to afford the food and everything else- but it can be done</p>

<p>A freezer and a wholesale membership (BJ&#39;s, Costco, Sam&#39;s club) go a long way.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve lived with many people and watch their spending habits and most that I see just have a hard time budgeting and managing money at all. </p>
