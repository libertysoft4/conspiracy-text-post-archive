        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t intend to break a rule by saying this place is not suited for someone genuinely interested in conspiracy discussion. It&#39;s extremely opinionated, political, unrelated to conspiracy, and scatterbrained. The genuine conspiracy discussion here seems manufactured to be vapid and rehashed. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen conspiracyii, and it&#39;s no better a forum. If reddit is no longer the place for conspiracy discussion, sobeit, please direct me elsewhere. </p>

<p>If a moderator comes through, I&#39;d like to know if you rely more on user voting or user reports to filter the inevitable troves of rule-breaking content. I should use another phrase, perhaps, because there isn&#39;t actually a rule that says you have to discuss conspiracies here. The closest rule is #11, which seems very lightly enforced on a typical hot page cycle. I ask because there doesn&#39;t seem to be a method beyond user voting, which is part of the manufacturing process that&#39;s been going on here for quite some time. If there is some criteria or &quot;limit&quot; to literal political discussion or baseless theory sharing, I&#39;d like to know what that is! </p>

<p>I&#39;m one of many that feel this way, I&#39;m sure. It&#39;s just not easy to speak up about it without becoming aggressive toward the sub users and moderators. I offer no actual criticisms here beyond my opinion of the off-topic nature of the subreddit. This is part of a meta conspiracy -- the subreddit being controlled by disingenuous and dastardly entities. For users who have been consumed by this control, it may be impossible to notice. For users who have been baffled by this control, it is blindingly obvious. To elaborate, posts, comments, upvotes, downvotes, and content are not being organically/naturally introduced into the subreddit. I see the word shill and troll used here a lot, but those are not words I would use to describe these entities. The nature of the deconstruction of conspiracy is based in cognitive manipulations. These manipulations ARE used by corporations, which a shill would accurately represent, however, the manipulations here are rooted in free thinking and eye-opening. </p>

<p>I digress into the meta conspiracy -- one curious will understand in time. The true purpose of this post is my own curiosity of other conspiracy subs that have not been targeted yet. Thank you for your time. I wish you all the best in your own free-think journey. </p>

<p>I quite enjoyed posting at the beginning but the quality and quantity of good discussion has fallen below my level of interest.</p>

<p>There are a few users in here that i will reply to (no matter their political affiliation, if they even have one) but the partisan pantomime shit is really stifling conversations.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve came to the same decision as yourself after seeing a comment yesterday about not trusting the intel agencies <strong>or</strong> the administration. The comment was downvoted to -24 when I last saw it. </p>

<p>Any suggestions for somewhere new?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of it is by design and many users across the web helped them refine their tactics. A lot of people over the years have lost interest in this sub an the content it provides. Which is what the people who actively work to keep us divided and in the dark want. I have had several usernames and was a very active participant in this sub since 2011, I spend 10 maybe 15 minutes here each day an it is sad to see the state of this place. it is obvious the mods have been given the stand down order when it comes to dealing with a certain group of stalkers on reddit. It is obvious that political agendas get spammed here everyday instead of actual conspiracies.</p>

<p>The attempt to smear this sub with bullshit and political agendas is a tactic to steer people away from this sub an what used to be its&#39; actual content. I stay for stubbornness and something PLC said years ago, if we leave they win. ]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to mod a small conspiracy phpbb forum. We rarely had more than 100 people online.</p>

<p>We were told very simply by addmin, if its a troll delete them. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s a well sourced argument, leave them be but always remember that the sub is first and foremost for conspiracy theorists to discuss theories and not a place for political or sociological agendas to be pushed. </p>

<p>For example</p>

<p>Post: Donald Trump is being set up.</p>

<p>Answer A: fuck off you moron, he&#39;s going down &lt;- you&#39;re getting a warning ban for a week and a full ban if you try it again.</p>

<p>Answer B: Donald Trump is a crook because [theory or evidence] &lt;- No problem, you&#39;re who we want. </p>

<p>With nonpartisan and sensible people modding, you&#39;d be surprised how easy it is to keep everything cool. </p>

<p>However i understand that 666k users is a very different beast, reddit&#39;s overly convoluted system doesn&#39;t matters help either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are referring to my comment about the stalkers of reddit, I was referencing the clear brigading, forum sliding, cross posting for the purpose of brigading. They also used to cyber stalk and cyber bully users all over reddit an the mods and admins ignore it. I made a thread in Polkadotgirls sub about sending all the evidence of their cyberstalk and harassing to the cops, it falls under the federal staues and laws for ewhat it is. These particular people then attempted to fake dox people to get spez to shut down the sub. Ironically a short time after that post they stopped threatening me in my inbox. Yet thewy still crosspost to their safespace in the hopes the rest of the hive mind will fly over here and harass people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, not talking about them, thankfully that&#39;s something i&#39;ve only read about (with the polkadot girl incident also) and not experienced. </p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about the users that have no interest in conspiracies but love to be right. The ones that shout about the official story but can only answer &quot;research it yourself&quot; when challenged on the legitimacy of their claims. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re a legit interested in discussion, you&#39;ll either present your theory or evidence, or at least have it ready for presentation when asked.</p>

<p>And I have to say, there are some legit users who need to up their game too. Big claims are exciting but without your theory to back them up, they remain claims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hahah, yeah they get on my nerves too. It is wrong to assume everyone has the knowledge or research skills as the next person. An if you are making a claim then back it up. An it can dissuade some people from joining in.  After many years here I know that if I mention something in a comment that others may not know I try to link the article. Or just for the purpose of showing where I came up with my theory or thought process.  I have done more work citing here than I did in college. Going back to my &quot;users across the web&quot; comment, every-time someone shares a new shill tactic they learn. So now I look at a lot of users here and wonder if it is inforwarts style gatekeeping. </p>

<p>Look at the discussion we&#39;re having. We know the tactics being used, we know the desired outcome of those tactics and we are giving them what the want by even having this discussion. </p>

<p>You know how I&#39;m sure of this? Our comments arent getting destroyed by down votes. </p>

<p>That sums it up right there. The people who have been here a long time and realize that something has happened to this place are the exact people we want to keep here. We should not encourage others to go to a smaller forum where they will have basically no voice. I have a feeling that a lot of the real users know what is going on and they can read between the lines here. Maybe one day the trolls will have another assignment and they will leave, or funding will be cut off. Either way, I think we can still talk to real people here if you ignore the downvotes and just try your best to communicate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is another sub I&#39;ve come across before. I believe holofractal is where I saw a referral. It&#39;s certainly better than the showerthoughts sub, but not really in the vein I&#39;m looking to replace. The ideas discussed there dwell on conspiracy, philosophy, personal experience, and so on. I think the variation is a strong point for criticalshowerthoughts&#39; premise, but not a strong point for conspiracy-oriented discussions. Thank you for the recommendation!</p>

<p>That said, we live in highly partisan times with social media keeping everyone in their own tribal filter bubble. Flytape tried a failed coup to take over this sub and make it pro-administrating, pro-government conspiracies only. That failed which renewed my hope in our future. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To answer your question truthfully, there is no improving a &quot;ship&quot; that is manufactured to be sinking. Not individually, and not even in moderately large numbers. The system is against it, and the false userbase is against it, meaning the only options are complete upheaval or wandering. I choose to wander due to the size of this community and how long the manufacturing has been occurring. </p>

<p>The bubble you speak of is a major part of instilling dastardly opinion and dynamic truth to a large group of people. I don&#39;t know what flytape is, but I guarantee you that they are not a minuscule fraction of the damaging being done here and elsewhere on reddit.  The human beings and the narratives within THIS bubble of reddit.com are now majorly disingenuous, confused, or radical. It&#39;s simply unwise to consider the situation as a whole while the parts of the whole are &quot;tainted&quot; in this way. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d like to know if you rely more on user voting or user reports to filter the inevitable troves of rule-breaking content. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>User reports by far. Voting patterns are notoriously unreliable given brigades, vote bots, etc. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If there is some criteria or &quot;limit&quot; to literal political discussion or baseless theory sharing, I&#39;d like to know what that is!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s really a tough problem. Conspiracies by their nature almost always have a political component, and I&#39;d argue that politics is inherently conspiratorial. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a good objective criterion or set of criteria we <em>could</em> use. </p>

<hr/>

<p>I still think our best option moving forward is the [no meta] flair I&#39;ve been trialling over the last few months. Briefly, in the main comment section of post flaired [no meta], users cannot make any reference to other users, to the sub or its mods, or to conspiracy theorists in general. In such threads, only on-topic, substantive comments are allowed. </p>

<p>This rule alone gets rid of joke/pun threads, shill/troll accusations, personal insults, or forum sliding. We&#39;ve tried <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=%22%5Bno+meta%5D%22&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;t=all">several of these threads</a>, and I think on the whole the experiment has been successful. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t had as much time as I&#39;d like or is needed to move this along, but eventually I&#39;d like to open up [no meta] threads for any user to be able to make. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how or if I&#39;ll use it for anything, but I reserved the sub r/conspiracyNoMeta. Maybe it would make sense to set that up as a sub that uses the [no meta] rules by default. If it gets traction, it would be much easier to implement the flair and rules system on this sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello!</p>

<p>Thanks for coming by and taking the time to write a response. </p>

<p>It&#39;s great to hear user reporting is seen as the more reliable judgement assistant compared to voting patterns. I will admit that my use of the word filter there was snide in essence; I know that user reports ultimately do not affect the judgement by you and the rest of the moderating team. I would assume you have many, many reports on popular threads that can not be fulfilled with punishment at your discretion. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conspiracies by their nature almost always have a political component</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not disagree that conspiracy and politics are somewhat intertwined historically, but I would like to reiterate what &quot;literal political discussion&quot; means from the main post. The content that is discussed by legitimate users on this subreddit has been plagued with mainstream and secondary news sources for a long time. The source of information is not as important as the information itself, but this longstanding trend of news sharing has led to an established political climate within the conspiracy sub itself. Is the grief poignant in this context? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a good objective criterion or set of criteria we could use</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this is not just your personal feeling as a moderator, and possibly more representative of the team&#39;s attitude altogether, there is likely much we the users are ignorant to in terms of planned/rejected criterion. My immediate thought is to re-write rule 3 and 11 to be more unified in their objectiveness regarding factual, intellectual, or engaging sources. A typical news headline is sensational, and a typical news body is lacking information related to the &quot;conspiracy&quot; being presented on this subreddit. This will not apply to all news sources used to create discussion here, but it will certainly cut a LOT of the bulk propaganda/fabrication that is artificially trended on reddit. Submission statements are working the opposite way to rid this misleading and fact-skewing trend here. If the source is more coherent, the title will typically be in tandem. If the source and title are coherent, a submission statement will no longer require even more misleading/sensational information to provide context for new eyes. These are merely thoughts in this moment; I am not a moderator of any community, and a community this large requires careful action with rules. The first 9 are essentially reddit-wide rules of courtesy and integrity, and the following rules are vague in their application to the content here, if you use the trending threads as a reference. Refining this space would be priority #1, in my opinion. </p>

<p>Now, the no meta flair is a great idea for a subreddit that is concise or organized, but it would only expound the issues currently being experienced currently. The content is not as concise as no meta could allow it to be. If applied to the sub in its current state, there would be menial progress made toward focusing discussion and inviting freethinking opinion. I hope I&#39;ve explained why I feel that&#39;s the case clearly in my previous paragraphs. The sub you have reserved would be a brilliant testing ground for a version of this sub with more strict content guidelines that lead to more integral discussions therein. </p>

<p>Thank you again for the reply! I truly hope for the best for this sub&#39;s future and conspiracy discussion on reddit as a whole. </p>

<p>From my perspective as a user and later a mod here, I think you have cause and effect reversed. We could forbid mainstream sources (however defined), and yet we&#39;d still see the same topics brought up for discussion, and the same partisan dialogue in the comments. I would agree that the most heavily contentious political threads with 200+ comments and bickering do tend to be mainstream sources, though. I&#39;m not entirely opposed to limiting MSM sources as link posts, though, (as long as they&#39;re allowed in text posts).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>IMO, the problem with content written for the conspiracy &quot;market&quot; tends to be among the most sensationalist (think Alex Jones). Not all of it, mind you, and some is exceptional in its professionalism, but without the backing of major corporations or foundations through advertising and underwriting, many outlets feel the need to use clickbait titles and emotional appeals over solid reporting. </p>

<p>Rightly or wrongly, when it comes to the tradeoff of ensuring that conspiracy theories have a chance to be heard (even and maybe especially fringe theories which I might not personally find any merit to) and reducing the amount of propaganda/sensationalism, I err on the side of fringe theories being heard, discussed, and debated. </p>

<p>From a user perspective, I would say this sub has three main uses: to learn, to share, to propagandize, and to profit. If you want to use this board to learn, you can still do that, just browse /new and skip over the blatant propaganda. If you want to share, you can still do that, post quality content and participate in relevant threads. </p>

<p>Most of the complaints we get are from people who want to use this sub to propagandize or to profit. If those are your goals, you only care what narratives the top-upvoted posts and comments are saying, and whether they agree with the message you want to propagandize or not. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Facts are going to be skewed regardless of what we do, and that wasn&#39;t the primary intent of SS in the first place; the intent was to reduce the amount of bot-spammed articles and sites, which it has done considerably. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The content is not as concise as no meta could allow it to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if I get your meaning here. Are you talking about the actual self.text of my [no meta] posts, or the threads? I&#39;ve found the threads to be more concise than any other 50+ comment threads, especially since 90% of the text in these threads is on-topic and contributing information. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If applied to the sub in its current state, there would be menial progress made toward focusing discussion and inviting freethinking opinion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I understand this either. I think (and this could be my own bias) you&#39;re putting too much stock into post titles. Yes, they have an influence on the discussion, but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s as much as you think. </p>

<p>Either way, I think I will start putting more of my reddit energy into making [no meta] a reality, in r/conspiracyNoMeta first, but then hopefully here as well. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is true, but I see this interest and discussion as a climate more than an established ideology of long-term users here. Hemorrhaging the mainstream mindframe and way of speaking will slowly lead to a change in climate, I believe. It may not be a totally different one, because as you say it is comments creating the dialogue and not the news source itself. Limiting MSM to text would be beneficial in the same way that disallowing them with a clear guide would be, so that&#39;s a completely reasonable idea to me. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I like the way you said this because it grounds my whole &quot;argument&quot; here as a quite embellished problem overall. That being said, the sharing and propagandizing parts are misleading. In the context of using /new and choosing content independent of an algorithm, the sub is still favored for propaganda, and that&#39;s the real issue I wanted to address here. The content is still here, it&#39;s just being obfuscated by those who do not want the content to be here, or something similar. The function of reddit as a whole is beyond /new by such a crazy curve, the easy manipulation of the algorithm and the userbase makes genuine care for content overshadowed by manufactured care for content, which then feeds into the cycle again (by means of /all /popular /hot, etc). One could argue that is the natural cycle after all, because users are not denied the ability to express themselves here. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you talking about the actual self.text of my [no meta] posts, or the threads?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was meaning current, non [no meta] discussions within threads would disallow the no meta tag to be as effective as it could be with a more refined posting guideline/ruleset. Since the title and source are the same, the tag will mainly cease fighting/discourteous behavior in lieu of weeding out the disingenuously rooted conversation that the source/title create in the first place. This is obviously not the case for many posts on this subreddit, it&#39;s just a widespread problem I&#39;ve seen worsen over the past 1.5 years or so. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Ah, I have explained myself quite inadequately there. I was thinking beyond the titles and comments of the sub to the body of text and meta-commentary of the sources. It is the infectious way of thinking and speaking that is limiting to focused discussion. I am basically pointing to the source once more as an invitation of a type of hivemind behavior that isn&#39;t exactly a bad thing, it&#39;s just a very limiting thing. This ties into the shifting climate I mentioned earlier. If the content that progresses discussion is changed to stray from MSM, the content of the discussion will change soon enough. </p>

<p>I will be keeping a close eye on your reddit energy&#39;s manifestations, haha </p>

<p>Can you think of a better way to word that?</p>

<p>I think what you have works but as you said, may end up needing to provide clarification a number of times.</p>

<p>How about something that just says the term &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; will not be used in derision?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>and the same partisan dialogue in the comments</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true, but I see this interest and discussion as a climate more than an established ideology of long-term users here. Hemorrhaging the mainstream mindframe and way of speaking will slowly lead to a change in climate, I believe. It may not be a totally different one, because as you say it is comments creating the dialogue and not the news source itself. Limiting MSM to text would be beneficial in the same way that disallowing them with a clear guide would be, so that&#39;s a completely reasonable idea to me. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you want to use this board to learn, you can still do that, just browse /new and skip over the blatant propaganda. If you want to share, you can still do that, post quality content and participate in relevant threads.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like the way you said this because it grounds my whole &quot;argument&quot; here as a quite embellished problem overall. That being said, the sharing and propagandizing parts are misleading. In the context of using /new and choosing content independent of an algorithm, the sub is still favored for propaganda, and that&#39;s the real issue I wanted to address here. The content is still here, it&#39;s just being obfuscated by those who do not want the content to be here, or something similar. The function of reddit as a whole is beyond /new by such a crazy curve, the easy manipulation of the algorithm and the userbase makes genuine care for content overshadowed by manufactured care for content, which then feeds into the cycle again (by means of /all /popular /hot, etc). One could argue that is the natural cycle after all, because users are not denied the ability to express themselves here. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you talking about the actual self.text of my [no meta] posts, or the threads?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was meaning current, non [no meta] discussions within threads would disallow the no meta tag to be as effective as it could be with a more refined posting guideline/ruleset. Since the title and source are the same, the tag will mainly cease fighting/discourteous behavior in lieu of weeding out the disingenuously rooted conversation that the source/title create in the first place. This is obviously not the case for many posts on this subreddit, it&#39;s just a widespread problem I&#39;ve seen worsen over the past 1.5 years or so. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not sure I understand this either. I think (and this could be my own bias) you&#39;re putting too much stock into post titles. Yes, they have an influence on the discussion, but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s as much as you think.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah, I have explained myself quite inadequately there. I was thinking beyond the titles and comments of the sub to the body of text and meta-commentary of the sources. It is the infectious way of thinking and speaking that is limiting to focused discussion. I am basically pointing to the source once more as an invitation of a type of hivemind behavior that isn&#39;t exactly a bad thing, it&#39;s just a very limiting thing. This ties into the shifting climate I mentioned earlier. If the content that progresses discussion is changed to stray from MSM, the content of the discussion will change soon enough. </p>

<p>I will be keeping a close eye on your reddit energy&#39;s manifestations, haha </p>
