The left and Hollywood is defending him saying it was just jokes but I’m sure if it had been someone on the right they’d want him executed. So now both sides are all pissed at each other. It’s a lovely world ain’t it!? Lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are only upset about James Gunns firing because the MCU is popular and he towed the Hollywood line with hating Trump.  Trump talks about grabbing the pussy of adult women back in 2005 and are told how terrible he is for making that joke.  Gunn makes 1000s of tweets about pedophillia as early as 2012 and we are told it was a joke, dark humor, or he was different back then. </p>

<p>In 2013 when Orson Card Scott was going to write Adventures of Superman the press went after DC for paying a guy who was against gay marriage and by selling that comic they were contributing to homophobia.  At the same time Marvel was doing a reprinting of Ultimate Iron Man graphic novels, also written by Scott, because the enders game movie was coming out.  The press fans as a whole left Marvel alone.  Why?  Because the MCU is popular and the cool thing for everyone to like.  </p>

<p>It is fair to ask why the rise in pedophilia news late.</p>

<p>It is not fair to imply that others are pushing for the normalization of pedophilia.  That isn&#39;t happening.  What IS happening is people talking about it happening, but there&#39;s no evidence of it actually happening.</p>

<p>To answer your original question, it is my suspicion that the two are connected as part of a bigger agenda.  </p>

<p>No.  I see it as bad actors trying to make the LGBT community look bad by comparing pedophilia to homosexuality.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not out of whack.  It is happening all the time.  But if you continue to propagate that fake news, you have become part of the problem.</p>

<p>Okay, by the same standard, was the rise in the reporting of sexual assault brought forward by the #metoo movement trying to normalize sexual assault?  No.  It was shining a light on something everyone already knew was happening but never talked about.  And it gave strength to the victims to finally come out, name their abusers and hopefully put an end to sexual assault.  Or at the very least, punish those who tried to get away with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Homie, they&#39;ve been trying to normalize pedophilia since the 60s. Ever heard of PIE? NAMBLA? The plan is to use the same methods the LGBTQ community used to create empathy for non-binary folks (A+ activism on their end) and sell the pedophile as some sort of &#39;born this way&#39; classification. This has been their plan for decades.</p>

<p>The whole &#39;non-offending&#39; pedo thing is a part of this; documented as an activist strategy on their end since at least the early 70s.  Majority of child porn is pre-pubescent children being raped; a disturbingly large amount of time, babies being raped to death. None of us normal folks have ever seen child porn, or have ever thought about what it actually is or even could be, which is the only reason anyone has tolerated this argument up to this point.</p>

<p>Pedophiles are sick and deserve a bullet in the head. They absolutely are trying to normalize their paraphilia. Minor Attracted Person is the newest euphemism they&#39;re trying out. All the incest themes in porn you see these days is also part of that agenda, (my own personal theory)...but once you understand they fuck their own kids and film it and pass it around among each other, that shit don&#39;t seem as kosher as &#39;oh, everyone was searching for &#39;mom&#39; so we just made literally every single porn incest themed&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, we should define &quot;they&quot;.  Nobody in the &quot;mainstream&quot; is trying to normalize pedophilia.  There&#39;s no doubt there are small groups (NAMBLA for example) that may be attempting normalization, but nobody with half a brain takes them serious.  Further, I suspect they aren&#39;t trying to normalize anything, but just attempting to get free press and send a signal so sick individuals know where to go/what to search to get their kicks.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s no question there are some very, very sick individuals out there doing terrible things to kids.  NOBODY is questioning that.  And those individuals need to be found and prosecuted.  But when places like this sub start watering down the issue with unfounded accusations, or as I suspect, spamming social media with TONS of accusations and inaccurate information, it creates concern burnout.  So if there is any normalization attempts happening, the conspiracist in me wonders if it is coming from some of the concern trolling that takes place in this community as a way to wear people down so they begin to ignore the very real issue.</p>

<p>When this sub typically refers to &quot;they&quot; - those that are normalizing it, &quot;they&quot; are implying (or just coming out and saying) it is the LGBT community, &quot;liberals&quot;, Hollywood &quot;elite&quot;, etc.  And while the lines may be crossed (Millie Bobby Brown is a fine example), pedophilia will never be normalized. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No dude, your putting your own bias on this with the LGBT community stuff. When we say &#39;they&#39;, we mean powerful people in the entertainment and 4th-estate industries who are pedophiles. They&#39;ve existed in hollywood since it&#39;s inception, look up baby burlesque. They exist in politics, in the judicial system, in CEO positions of huge companies. When I say &#39;they&#39;, I mean pedophiles.</p>

<p>The reason there&#39;s so many of them in high up positions has to do with psychopathy. I believe that&#39;s the connection. Psychopaths more likely to be pedophiles, psychopaths more likely to be successful and gain large amounts of power, create systems that nurture support and foster it for a variety of different reasons. &#39;Their&#39; agenda is the pedophile agenda, which is to normalize pedophilia, and &#39;they&#39; are pedophiles.</p>

<p>Save the Children covered it up and other charities took on the workers involved, nobody got fired or prosecuted.</p>

<p>The UN heard about this any several other similar situations involving big child charities and they covered it up too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honest answer? It started with pizzagate (the Alefantis Comet investigation). What was a pretty standard conspiracy theory caught wildfire because it hit on all of the right buttons: vilified the left, involved Clinton, there was gay stuff, someone called a kid a ho-tard, etc. Whether you believe in it or not it was a huge deal here and was very contentious. As things like Roy Moore happened, and many of the people who were very interested in pizzagate supported Moore, people on the left (generally speaking) began pushing back with comments about Epstein and Trump, Dennis Hastert, etc. It has become an attack issue in its own way, while both left and right obviously recognize its abhorrent and criminal it has become an easy way to attack people on the other side politically. People are currently tying members of the sex cult to Hillary through campaign donations saying Hilary must’ve run a sex slave ring. Others point to Trump saying he walked in on teenagers in response. Now a writer made a terrible NAMBLA joke so he must be a pedo, also coincidentally he’s anti-Trump and the guy who cut and pasted his twitter comments is vehemently pro-Trump (and rape). So it’s to the point where because Hollywood has a pretty ghoulish history, Mike Cernovich is accusing comedians and writers who are critical of Trump of being pedophiles and having his followers spam what may not be fake outrage, but is certainly artificially amplified outrage. The Roseanne thing didn’t help, although I would say it’s different since she said racist shit while employed that got her fired, versus the racist shit she said 6-10 years previous like Gunn’s terrible jokes. Still many see this as a tit for tat situation. </p>

<p>That’s my take as I see it. </p>

<p>There are pedos in high up places. And pedos have been around for all of human history. But there’s no sudden surge of it. There have been a few articles on how to treat pedophilia as an illness to be treated or cured, to lower incidences of it.

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re not the same thing.  Pedophilia is a mental disorder and child molestation is hurting a kid.  The terms get mixed up a lot by the public, but you can be a pedophile without actually hurting a kid.  Personally I think people who have it should get therapy/psychiatric help in order to prevent them from acting on their urges, but I fully believe child molesters(and those who seek out child pornography) should go to prison. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, I am not a Dem and do not support the GOP. I am a Libertarian and have been for a long time. And really, what political party you support should not matter on a conspiracy sub but this is what it has turned into. </p>

<p>Now to why I asked the question. Did you read the tweets? It was an extremely dumb thing to do but I have said shit like this and I have heard people say those types of things as a joke. Doesn&#39;t make them a pedo. No pedo is going to be out there talking like this on a public platform anyway. </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t lost on me that there is definitely a political motivation behind all of this stuff. Hollywood supports Dems. And 90% of the people who subscribe to the pedo stuff are GOP supporters. So whenever people can attack Hollywood, and especially when it comes to pedos, they are going to pounce. The PG thing all started during an election. Q continued that narrative and now tons of people are looking for any type of connection to it. The reason I asked my question is because so many people come on here and attach any type of sexual stuff to kids because of it. I have seen people on here attach NXIUM, Cosby, Weinstein, etc... with pedos but there isn&#39;t any connection. When you actually look at it, there isn&#39;t much out there with pedos, it is people attaching it on their own because that is what they think, or how they want it to be. </p>

<p>The political bend to all of it is what makes me cringe when I see all of this stuff. I choose to not attach myself to a political psy-op. </p>

Trump talks about grabbing the pussy of adult women back in 2005 and are told how terrible he is for making that joke.  Gunn makes 1000s of tweets about pedophillia as early as 2012 and we are told it was a joke, dark humor, or he was different back then. </p>

<p>In 2013 when Orson Card Scott was going to write Adventures of Superman the press went after DC for paying a guy who was against gay marriage and by selling that comic they were contributing to homophobia.  At the same time Marvel was doing a reprinting of Ultimate Iron Man graphic novels, also written by Scott, because the enders game movie was coming out.  The press fans as a whole left Marvel alone.

<p>Okay, by the same standard, was the rise in the reporting of sexual assault brought forward by the #metoo movement trying to normalize sexual assault?  No.  It was shining a light on something everyone already knew was happening but never talked about.  And it gave strength to the victims to finally come out, name their abusers and hopefully put an end to sexual assault.  Or at the very least, punish those who tried to get away with it.</p>
