    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Pedophiles are 99% male</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder if the social favor towards women skews the stats. For instance if a female teacher has sex with a student - <em>Oh that&#39;s just &#39;misconduct&#39;, not &#39;rape&#39;.</em> Very rare to see a woman called a pedophile for  the same crime a male rightfully gets called a pedo for. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pedophilia is natural</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you actually watch the video, her argument isn&#39;t necessarily wrong.  One of her arguments is that pedo&#39;s have no control over their own sexual preference, just like you didn&#39;t choose to be a homo, or a hetero. </p>

<p>The mistake OP is making is assuming that natural = good. Poison is naturally occurring. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we end the stigma against pedo&#39;s we can help them get the help they need. Whereas if you stigmatize them, they will go into hiding and never get help, increasing the likelihood of them abusing. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d like to see someone say how she&#39;s wrong there. </p>

<p><em>&quot;No-one is responsible for their feelings, but everyone is responsible for their actions&quot;</em> - I&#39;d like to see someone argue against that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it surprising that we wouldn&#39;t be able to name any pedophiles who haven&#39;t been arrested? Studies have shown there are people who live with these urges and never do anything about them. For understandable reasons, these people are not exactly screaming out on a rooftop about having pedophiliac urges.</p>

<p>This is in no way a defense of those people or feelings, btw. Just wanted to point out that it makes sense we&#39;d only know about the ones who acted (or were about to act) on them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>but dude... you are talking about an extreme case here</p>

<p>We do not need any kind of law or convention that says if someone looks at your child you can hit them, or whatever</p>

<p>Just get rid of the guns, and let the pedos look if thats all they are doing</p>

<p>It is almost like you are saying &quot;Did you know there are sickos out there who get off on dogshit? We have to legislate the death penalty for people who dont pick up their dogshit, in order to stop these sickos getting off!&quot;</p>

<p>Your example is very disinigenuous, because no way would a pedo walk behind your daughter every day while breathing heavily or whatever, he would just steal a sly glance or two from across the street... the case you described is certainly extreme, so warrants a punch, but not a law</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said we could prevent the behavior via legislation. My argument is that we shouldn’t say that a pedo who never acted is harmless simply because they never were convicted of touching anyone. It implies that they can look all they want, which I’m arguing is still unacceptable. My example is not extreme because most pedophiles don’t get convicted for sexual harasssment...which means if they are in society not touching, then they must be at least looking.</p>
