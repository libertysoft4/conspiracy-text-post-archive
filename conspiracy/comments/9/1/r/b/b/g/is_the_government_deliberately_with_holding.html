<p>It is estimated the Universe contains at least two trillion galaxies full of billions of stars like our sun. Is it no wonder then that a sizeable amount of the population believe Aliens exist. A sizable proportion of the Conspiracist society however go one step further They claim Extra Terrestrials have and still are visiting us! For example did you know in 2009 the USA created a multimillion dollar worth team to investigate UFOS?! Is the government hiding something? That why we are about to tell you in our video:</p>

<p>You do realise the CIA use dissinfomation agents to cover any black ops/top secret projects they have going?
U.S. government really do conduct  top-secret UFO conspiracies - only designed, not to hide UFOs but publicise them, fuelling and even creating the major UFO myths. Flying saucers, alien abductions, crash-landed spacecraft, secret underground bases in New Mexico - they were all created by the U.S. government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The CIA absolutely uses disinformation and Steven Greer addresses that along with a total of 800 testimonials from people working in a wide range of industries from air traffic controllers to marine pilots to Air Force pilots to civilian pilots to navy pilots to astronauts (specifically Edgar Mitchell who was the 6th man to walk on the moon) to Presidential national security staff members of various presidencies to radar operators to aerospace engineers to physics professors to a host of other professionals. The UFO phenomenon is undoubtedly the subject of disinformation. The disinformation is created to create nuance about UFOs so that people “don’t really know whether they are real or not”. Steven Greer has been asked by multiple presidencies to brief the sitting president and some cabinet members on the UFO topic because those sitting presidents were being lied to by other members of the US government. All of this is address in Steven Greer’s film “Unacknowledged”. He has documents to back up his claims on his website as well as hundreds of hours of testimony </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hundreds of people’s testimonies from around the globe (normal civilians like me, not the types of people listed in my longer post) describe the vehicles in their UFO sightings as “seamless”. When humans make things, we make parts and then put those pets together somehow. In almost any manufacturing of any product, seams are formed in the creation of that product because that product is made of different parts put together. To me, this could indicate that sightings of “seamless” vehicles would mean those vehicles are not manufactured the way we humans have always manufactured things. </p>

<p>Also, as stated earlier, over 800 people have given statements and testimonies to Steven Greer about the UFO phenomenon, and many of those people include former employees of companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin and many military and government intelligence agencies. Many of these people talk about working directly with the technology that propels these UFO craft and have documents available online to back up the fact that these people actually work for who they say they worked for. Many of these same people and others give testimony that actual non human UFO craft are studied to help design and create the human made UFO craft. I strongly recommend watching the testimonies given on camera and checking out the files on his website when you have the time. It’s very interesting.</p>

<p>Steven Greer interviewed Edgar Mitchell of Apollo 14 (6th man to walk on the moon) and Colonel Corso who was a member of President Eisenhower’s national security staff. Both of these men, along with many other people giving Steven Greer video testimonies available online, stated that crashed UFO craft from a non human source was used to help develop the man made UFO craft some see today. </p>
