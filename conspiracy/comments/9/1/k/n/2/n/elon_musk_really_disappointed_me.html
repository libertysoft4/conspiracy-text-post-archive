        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I invested in Tesla because Musk sounded like a superman genius and could do no wrong.  I also thought that he would have no problem meeting his production quota since this isn&#39;t &#39;rocket science&#39; or the &#39;matrix&#39;, or the super tunnel boring machines, or the big colonization of Mars.  </p>

<p>I know he got a report on exactly how to meet this quota - he had to.  It would be hundreds if not over one thousand pages but don&#39;t you think with this much riding on the line he would read it and reread it and then reread and study it again?!  This report I&#39;m sure would give ranges of production numbers based on many factors.</p>

<p>How did he miss his numbers so badly?  He didn&#39;t read the report or even ask any questions is my conclusion.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a typical egoist who cons experts into doing all the work while he goes off and has a good time is what I&#39;m thinking.  I&#39;ve worked for assholes like him all my career.  </p>

<p>What&#39;s even worse is he is abusing his employees to make up for his negligence (raw sewage all over the factory floor, people losing limbs etc.)</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure he will lose Tesla and Wall Street will give it to a manager who can turn it around.</p>

This A-list CEO talks about sleeping on the factory floor.  He believes it represents a form of boasting about his work ethic, and devotion to his company.<br/>
The reality is that a megalomaniac has built himself a massive empire, full of lies - and he can feel the foundation buckling underneath him now.<br/>

<p>Whenever you find yourself making a financial decision on these merits you really need to take a step back and really focus in on what you can realistically expect and how it will be achieved. If you find yourself falling back to the the charismatic talking head instead of logistics and $$$ you need to fucking bail.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was weird to me.  To do as much as he was doing was impossible in hind sight but he sounded so legitimate.  </p>

<p>I worked with frauds that know how to manipulate people to make themselves look good until they get caught and then they are toast.  People eventually give up on you and get on with their lives.</p>

<p>We had an executive director that was a complete idiot but his one talent was to color code things. Red for poor,  Yellow for fair, and Green for good.  His whole management style was - you are red start improving or else.  That was it!  His big mantra was &#39;What gets measured gets done&#39;  He was complete boob but he went right up the ladder.</p>

<p>This is what i hear is happening to Musk.  People are heading out the door.  If Tesla goes under it will be one of the biggest scandals in US history and no one will touch Musk with a ten foot pole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m neither for, or against musk but to play devils advocate.. what if things came up in his progress? 
Like discovering a better method of production (even though it may take longer), technological breakthroughs along the way, or additional safety measures taken...</p>

<p>Tons of scenarios could’ve popped up with such HUGE concepts and unfortunately, it’s not a single mans job so he really does need to rely on employees to help him attain his goal. Most companies need their employees for this reason.. unless you truly believe every business owner is an egoist for relying on employees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Working 20 hours a day doesn&#39;t cut it.  There had to be an analysis of what production numbers could be achieved and it had to be right on the money.  I worked on billion dollar infrastructure projects and we demanded cost estimates, bonding capacity, revenue streams etc.  On top of this we had RFPs, standards, plans, contracting methods etc.  If Musk can&#39;t grasp this type of analysis then he must be totally relying on others and either not listening to them or shooting for the most optimistic assessments.  No way can I think it&#39;s anything different.  I can see missing the numbers by small percentage but he totally blew them.  The submarine stunt makes me thinks he&#39;s becoming unstable.</p>

<p>I had a chance at one job where my corrupt boss told me I didn&#39;t have to show up for work to be his little butt boy but I couldn&#39;t do it.  Now I&#39;m incredibly proud of my choice.</p>

<p>Of course there are people with crippling injuries because of Musks incompetence and hubris that have to take of their families the best they can.  I&#39;m sure Musk is is trying to deny them workman&#39;s comp though.</p>

So he must have not taken the advice and reports or he is deliberately not delivering the things people want. Maybe he is an actor to distract people and never really produce results that change the status quo.

I started to think that if I was running the company my whole life would be meeting my production numbers which wouldn&#39;t be easy but wouldn&#39;t be the labors of Hercules, however he was running around thinking about rockets to mars and the matrix and tunnels etc. I should have seen this but didn&#39;t.
