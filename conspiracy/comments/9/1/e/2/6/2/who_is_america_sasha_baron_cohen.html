<p>He makes fun of everyone - including his own character in the bits.  It&#39;s all about the ridiculousness of it all, and how poorly people <em>listen</em> and <em>think</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i meant in the show, WiA. at least it was the first episode i watched.
and honestly, i didn’t see the website and i’m not about to let a salty article make me think one way or the other. but if he was making fun of conspiracy theorists, which i am and i assume you are, of course some of us will be mad. that’s what happens when someone makes a joke at your expense. or, like me, you can laugh it off and realize that it doesn’t really matter. people are looking way too much into it but no one seems to remember that he’s a comedian, he writes comedy that’s meant to disturb and upset certain people. it’s not going to make sense, there may be a subject or 2 that he won’t cover for whatever reason, but it’s still just comedy. i think people being so shitty about it just don’t have a good sense of humor. seriously, i get we’re supposed to be a serious bunch down here on r/conspiracy but when you start calling a comedian a zionist propaganda pusher, are you any better than the fake news idiots lashing out bc they don’t like what they hear?</p>

<p>Is <a href="https://www.jta.org/2018/07/16/arts-entertainment/sacha-baron-cohens-newest-character-israeli-gunslinger-taking-aim-pro-israel-conservatives">this article</a> referencing the Israel scene?

    <div class="md"><p>i’ve been a fan of his for a long time and i can say this, he has a knack for playing the right character for the job. ill say it again, the butt of the joke is never gonna think it’s funny. the joke this time is the absurdity of conservative politics in america so who gets mad? the conservative politicians and the people who support them, it’s a joke at their expense and they aren’t very good at taking jokes. they will say anything to discredit people they don’t like, and that’s been proven by them a million times over. i’d say read into him as much as you want, but remember he’s a comedian. and a shock comedian at that. people are gonna spin his words to help or harm whatever they wish, that’s how it works. it’s like if a conservative christian was to say that bill
burrs “sinking a random cruise ship” bit was a way to trick millennials into supporting population control. in other words, it’s insane and you should know better than to take them seriously. even if it does promote dialogue about a certain topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i meant in the show, WiA. at least it was the first episode i watched.
and honestly, i didn’t see the website and i’m not about to let a salty article make me think one way or the other. but if he was making fun of conspiracy theorists, which i am and i assume you are, of course some of us will be mad. that’s what happens when someone makes a joke at your expense. or, like me, you can laugh it off and realize that it doesn’t really matter. people are looking way too much into it but no one seems to remember that he’s a comedian, he writes comedy that’s meant to disturb and upset certain people. it’s not going to make sense, there may be a subject or 2 that he won’t cover for whatever reason, but it’s still just comedy. i think people being so shitty about it just don’t have a good sense of humor. seriously, i get we’re supposed to be a serious bunch down here on r/conspiracy but when you start calling a comedian a zionist propaganda pusher, are you any better than the fake news idiots lashing out bc they don’t like what they hear?</p>
