It seems that most of the Last Vegas Shooting conspiracy videos have been scrubbed clean from YouTube, and replaced by news clips from Fox, CNN, etc. It is my belief that we are living in a state of censorship, but we might not be fully aware of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check around the 25 second mark. Sure, in the beginning of the video, you can hear 
reverberations from one firearm. But around 25 seconds in, the shots don&#39;t line up at all. Play it back a couple times around the 25-30 second mark and you&#39;ll hear what I&#39;m talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/5hXJhnNRu1E">https://youtu.be/5hXJhnNRu1E</a></p>

<p>Watch this video, which compares a bumpstock to a heavy machine gun. If you knew your firearms, then you would know that the shots during the shooting we&#39;re not that from a bumpstock. <a href="https://youtu.be/_mXe9dk77bk">https://youtu.be/_mXe9dk77bk</a></p>

<p>Read about Paddock, (click the link) who had a plane registered in his name, but is now registered to Volant LLC, a defense contractor that&#39;s part of the military industrial complex. <a href="https://flightaware.com/resources/registration/N5343M">https://flightaware.com/resources/registration/N5343M</a></p>

<p>There is too much suspicious evidence for me to accept the official narrative that is full of inconsistent details.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem. It&#39;s also alarming that his girlfriend put &quot;FBI&quot; as her place of employment on a loan.</p>

<p>Not to mention, her fingerprints were found on ammunition that paddock was found with. <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/las-vegas-gunman-stephen-paddock-girlfriend-fingerprints-ammunition-781028">https://www.newsweek.com/las-vegas-gunman-stephen-paddock-girlfriend-fingerprints-ammunition-781028</a></p>

<p>My best guess is that Paddock was a gun dealer. Why would you need all of those guns to carry out a shooting? The official narrative isn&#39;t logical, in my opinion.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more interesting is learning that Saudi Prince Al-Waleed owns the top five floors (Four Seasons) of the Mandalay Bay. In my opinion, there are too many discrepancies to simply accept the mainstream narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so in the first video you sent I really dont hear anything that would suggest multiple shooters. The driver of the car seems to be driving under something large right at 25 seconds in and because of that, the microphone captures the audio differently. You have to be careful when relying on audio from a not so good handheld camera in situations like this. Could I be wrong, yeah. </p>

<p>Lets say there were multiple shooters, those shooters would absolutely have to be in the same room as Paddock since his suite is the only one with broken windows. But the last known footage of Paddock alive is him getting off the elevator and heading towards his room about 10 hours before the shooting, alone. Could someone have come up to his room in those 10 hours, sure but there isn&#39;t any hard evidence of that happening, at least not that the public is aware of. Footage from the days leading up to the attack also show paddock bringing over 20 suitcases to his room, further suggesting that he planned out the attack. This same footage also shows him spending hours gambling by himself and rarely making conversation with anyone. He was never seen meeting with anyone in the days leading up either. Now you have to ask, if there were multiple shooters in Paddocks room that night, why would the police cover it up? What do they gain from covering up a second or maybe even third shooter?</p>

<p>There were a lot of reports that day of multiple shooters which is logical considering he fired over 1,100 rounds of ammo. Anyone at that concert could have heard all those gunshots and mistaken it for multiple shooters.</p>

<p>As for whether or not an M240 was used in the shooting I really don&#39;t know if that even matters, I&#39;m really only trying to debunk the multiple shooters theory. And as to whether or not Paddock was a gun dealer, again I don&#39;t care if he was or wasn&#39;t. Also, Paddocks girlfriend was ruled out as a suspect by the police. I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;m not convinced. Im gonna go ahead and believe the police on this one until someone presents solid evidence of conspiracy or a &quot;set up&quot;. Paddock was a sick bastard who acted alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well they released photos of the crime scene plus I was in vegas recently and could see the windows that had been smashed on the mandalay bay. There doesn’t seem to be any hard evidence that would point to another shooter. I also remeber watching videos of the shooting and i dont remember hearing 2 guns go off at once. It always sounded like one gun going off at a time which suggests a lone gunman.</p>

I watched tons of videos the next day and for weeks and months after, you can clearly hear at least two different guns with different patterns and different loudness and many people on those videos said there were shots coming from different directions.

    <div class="md"><p>It is really confusing. I got the chance to experience what it was like to be &quot;relatively&quot; shot at in basic training and in the video you can hear the report of the gun fire, and also the sonic boom of the bullets as they fly overhead which sounds more like a snap. I watched dozens of videos and you could clearly hear both the report and the snap. The thing is you have to listen to the rate of fire. In most videos I could only discern one rate of fire, but there was one video where there was two distinct rates of fire. I don&#39;t know if that would be him firing two guns at the same time or if that is the evidence of multiple shooters.   </p>

<p>All in all it is extremely confusing and now no one will ever know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea. That seems to be the source of most of the shots fired. I haven&#39;t seen many videos where I thought I heard an obvious second source. The cab video is one and another was in the crowd. Very easily could have used suppressors from other locations. And even if helicopters were used, if high end military copters were used they likely have a silent mode where you can&#39;t hear it very well. Honestly some scary shit. </p>

<p>The time I saw a helicopter using it&#39;s tactical mode was on an old army fort near Hershey Pennsylvania. One min it is paddling the air loud as can be, and the next it is just there. Silent.</p>

It&#39;s a chaotic situation, people are freaking out, someone hears about a shooter, sees everyone running around, so they just say there is a shooter, and people hear it, and keep repeating it.

    <div class="md"><p>Not to mention, the Strip is basically a canyon. Echoes travel through the canyon formed by the buildings. </p>

<p>I know people in security on the Strip, that I&#39;m actual friends with from my days working at Caesars, that say nothing happened. And these are the kind of people that I trust wouldn&#39;t lie to me. </p>

<p>Besides that, because personal feelings aren&#39;t always right (see people who have been cheated on, lied to by business partners, etc), where are the pictures? Are you telling me LVMPD or the FBI paid off millions of people that would have been in the casinos/on the Strip at that time? There&#39;s not a single instagram/tweet/FB picture of a gun, bullet hole, or a video of actual shooting and or people with wounds at casinos away from the Rt. 91 site. </p>

<p>Why would they pay off millions of people to pretend there was no multiple shooter angle, but not pay off thousands of people to pretend there was no Paddock to begin with? Especially when they had a willing patsy in ISIS that could have made a terrorist massacre a much more credible explanation than &quot;A random white guy bought a bunch of guns, calculated bullet drop, shot at tanks he knew wouldn&#39;t explode, and killed a bunch of people with no known motive&quot;? </p>

<p>For those of you that think it was a government op... why not actually explode the fuel tanks? Government actors, whether American or Saudi, or otherwise, could have easily gotten access to the fuel tanks, rigged them with effective explosives, and blown up the fuel tanks then blamed it on ISIS when they immediately jumped on the &quot;He was our guy!&quot; bandwagon or created a terrorist response of their own. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it was just an old white guy alone in a room, but I have yet to see any evidence it was multiple people at multiple hotels trying to commit a terrorist attack. At best it was multiple people from 32-134 and 32-135 and maybe a failed plot to assassinate a Saudi prince. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw literally nothing in this video that made me think something was fake.  I saw people grieving.  If you take still shots from a video, you can essentially pick and choose any expression you want at some point.</p>

<p>Also, people in sad and stressful situations often try to manage a courageous smile or gesture.  If you don&#39;t know that, then you haven&#39;t been through a situation like that.</p>

<p>For me, I don&#39;t believe anything I don&#39;t see myself more than about 80%, so I&#39;m not going to weigh in on a shooting from 3000 miles away from me... But if you&#39;re espousing the idea that this video is some sort of magic bullet of proof of anything, I have to massively question your judgment and bias.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve learned a lot about body language over 40 years of dealing with liars and criminals. These so called &#39;victims&#39; aren&#39;t even remotely typical of what we would expect from people who are truly grieving. Have you never experienced catastrophic loss? Never witnessed someone else experience it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s kind of like a dystopian future where Big Brother orchestrates false flag attacks to keep the public fearful &amp; therefore under big brothers watch.</p>

<p>In this case I lean towards the government of one of the last truly &quot;free&quot; nations attempting to remove the self defense weapons of one of the last armed populations. I remember the rights taken away by the patriot act and how easily the public was convinced when they had something to fear.</p>

<p>I subscribe to the theory that sandy hook was a drill that went &quot;live&quot; with simulated fear. A lot of very strange coincidence&#39;s or details with sandy hook (like the victims family history,victims family photos,the class photo,the closed casket funerals,the neighbors statements ) But just enough there to prove something did happen for everyone watching the TV</p>

<p>Vegas I&#39;m still trying to figure out.it was the deadliest shooting ever yet Donald Trump is investigated more passionately. Basic reading into Vegas is only suspicious if you already question shootings imo. I have questions about some of the mysterious circumstances of that day. But they&#39;re only suspicious if I start to question what happened. </p>

<p>Because otherwise it&#39;s just another lone gunman. With the establishment ready to provide another narrative that helps the public not feel so lost, while not really telling the truth.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget It&#39;s recorded human history that the  US govt has pursued mind control(MK ultra),false flags(destroying civilian planes), mass surveillance(Snowden), and I&#39;m sure others could share more. With what&#39;s been attempted in the past I can&#39;t imagine it would be too hard for them to make someone crazy enough to shoot up a school. Or make it so a few planes fly into some buildings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the time and effort you put into your reply!!!</p>

<p>I researched 911 &amp; some others to the point I was so disgusted, and enternaly, gravely furious that our own gov, (even if part of the shadow govt) would be so EVIL to its own ppl. Purely, inexcusable to 100+infinity% percent.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s still happening... </p>

<p>The Vegas shooting I def saw and heard more suspicious activity myself, I had friends day on FB saying they heard shootings, or heard of shootings in multiple places, many were checking in saying they were safe and what they experiencing out there.</p>

<p>With Sandy Hook, sadly, I was like, &#39;just another school shooting&#39;, and tuned out since they happen in today&#39;s world. But later thought that boy and the story odd. </p>

<p>With the Columbine shooting we have video of them actually there, shooting, trying to set off thier bombs, walking through the school...
We have access to parts of thier journals, access to thier peers, and eyewitnesses giving interviews. We found out how they got the guns. Found recordings of them talking negatively about ppl at school. There&#39;s so mucb hard evidence on those boys... </p>

<p>And it seems we get less and less of tangible evidence with these new shootings, and otherwise.. when really- we have better cameras, better tech, better media coverage, better investigators it should be clearer what&#39;s happening. But really it&#39;s a lot more vague, inaccurate, etc. Hardly any evidence that us the people can see and react to.</p>

<p>Such a sad state our country is in. Home of the free is a farce.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah 9/11 is the root cause of my questioning too</p>

<p>Even at the most objective some &quot;coincidences&quot; surrounding 9/11 are evil. Creepy. It stole people&#39;s lives.</p>

<p>Whoa! First hand experience on your end huh! I&#39;ve heard it mentioned it could be echoes and I don&#39;t deny that. Idk about your case but in the video I saw where shots are heard it sounded too hard to judge imo. Especially because I have no experience with gunfire irl. But again like your own friends, there&#39;s enough there for us to at least investigate/question right?</p>

<p>Me too. I think that&#39;s part of it too. I realized after watching &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; videos that at some point I had accepted it too. I think it was senior year in highschool that I accepted it. So weird. Yeah and personally I try to never argue anything more than the fact something&#39;s <strong>odd</strong></p>

<p>Yes! And even with columbine dude... Which blew my mind recently. So much really weird with it. And when you think about it it was the quote on quote <em>first one</em>. So there&#39;s a lot we wouldn&#39;t have even thought to question. Stuff like sandy hook or Vegas with multiple shooters blew my mind but even in columbine there was some buff built adult man walking around shooting?? People on the roof?? SO many CIA/FBI meddling. But like you said even then we were given evidence but damn right now I wonder if it was to sell us on our first impression of it. I always picture recent shooters stalking the halls like I remember from grainy columbine footage too. It&#39;s unsettling.</p>

<p>Totally. One of these shootings even led to the entire state making it illegal to disclose evidence of the crime. No way to verify anything but what the state says?? Ominous.</p>

<p>I saw someone recently say that every person we take the time to talk to is a +1 for us and -1 for them. Everyone is capable of &quot;waking up&quot; but it&#39;s not going to happen unless we take the time to talk to them. It&#39;s why I abhor the current identity politics. People are distracted by the bright orange object in the white House, which is just the entertainment division of whoever&#39;s in charge...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally forgot about the theory that were more than Dylan and Eric shooting @ Columbine. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t rule out that they had help... But I don&#39;t think there was a bunch of shooters... There was so much confusion that day for everyone. And eyewitnesses accounts are actually some of the worst &#39;hard evidence&#39; out there... it&#39;s all about perception. </p>

<p>Imagine sending a bunch of people, one at a time, to drive down a dark road where we&#39;ve set up a bag to look like its blowing in the wind across or near the road, some people are going to see a cat, some a raccoon, some coyote, some a ghost, some something else. And some might see just a bag. What we think we see, is so easily distorted based on stress levels, lighting, biases, and more. We&#39;ve all seen something from the corner of our eye and thought it was something way different than reality.</p>

<p>All the people on the ground at Columbine were under mega stress, scared, reactive. I just don&#39;t see enough evidence where there was multiple shooters. </p>

<p>I&#39;m if there was more to the shooters, we would have gotten more evidence than some eyewitness accounts.</p>

<p>Dylan&#39;s own mother has given lots of interviews, wrote a book... If she thought more of his friends were involved she definitely had the platform to get it out. </p>

<p>Many of the kids there have given interviews. If they all thought there was a predator still in thier community, I&#39;m sure they&#39;d been found.</p>

<p>I even listened to interviews with journalists that have interviewed people on all sides of this on NPR and such and just not heard anything credible.</p>

<p>I was in HS when that shooting happened... I got Into it then, and then again a few years ago. Lol it was a rabbit hole for me. I wanted to understand it all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad you said theory because it is still unproven!</p>

<p>I can agree with that. I never pictured the school swarming with shooters anyways, just listing the anomalies that stuck with me! </p>

<p>Nice I&#39;m glad you expanded with that example. I had never stopped to really think of the sheer mind bending terror that would&#39;ve been on the ground. It must have not been hard to have felt like there were shooters everywhere. I know they were scared and that affected people but my columbine &quot;red pill&quot; of questioning what I remember was recent so I might be a little eager with the multiple shooters thing xD</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When something tragic happens people panic. There were probably alot of different calls into 911 and hysteria causes confusion. Also people were most definitely drunk and on other drugs. Media also puts out bad information just to be the first reporter on the topic. This can explain why they said there were shootings at multiple hotels. People likely mixed up the hotel names.</p>

<p>Example being that I was looking for a video of the news report about the New Mexico compound to show a friend and could find nothing.  Yet digging through here for a link, I found it and the video was still up.</p>

<p>Pretty much it has become impossible to find any video that is not some commercial related thing (like music video, tv clips, movie trailer, etc.)</p>

<p>Here is a good video proving there are two separate sources. </p>

<p>You can hear the echo from the close shots. Sound travels roughly 1000ft/second so you can easily count and do the math. </p>

<p>The long long long long long.... pause. then you hear the shots from a distance. Absolute proof. The videos i remember in the crowd were SOOO hard to discern because of the sonic boom from the bullets. The taxi video is something I just got to watch last night. We R Fucked.

<p>That would need to be studied and without recreating it I don&#39;t know how. 
As long as the barrel of the gun is facing out the windows it wouldn&#39;t have that much impact. Not as much as was heard. But facing away from the windows very well could.</p>
