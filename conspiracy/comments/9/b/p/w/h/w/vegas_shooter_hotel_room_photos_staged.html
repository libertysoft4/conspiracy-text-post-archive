I have a similar rifle, have dropped it 10 times and has never once landed upright, and if he was holding it, it would be on his other side. The rifle to the left, again is placed, if it was knocked over even with the weight of the gun plus gravitational force would be enough to move the spring of the leg on the stand. Also WHY THE HELL IS HE WEARING GLOVES on a suicide mission?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple thinks to keep in mind.  If Paddock looked that sickly and old, as he does in that videos, how was he able to fire 1,100 rounds at a high rate of speed from 475 yards and be 40% accurate?  Maybe he used the bi-pods, but in order to do that, he&#39;d either have to be prone (which wouldn&#39;t make much sense since he was 32 stories above the concert, or he had a table or snipers platform (which I have never seen).  The fact we have an out of shape elderly man with no prior formal fire arms training, continuously shooting and staying on target enough to hit 450-500 people is incredible imo... Let alone all the other aspects of his story, like winning 5 million at video poker in a year owning 2 planes with sketchy prior ownera.  Still think room 134 was a stake out room for 135, and something went down they are covering up.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I&#39;m talking about.  I&#39;m relatively young compared to Paddock and I don&#39;t think I could stay on a target the size of that crowd from 475 yards, at that rate of fire and than many shots.  It&#39;s another example of the extra ordinary aspect of this story... Even Jose Campos&#39;s story/timeline doesn&#39;t make sense when he had already been interviewed and allowed to drive to Mexico with in days of the shooting... Let alone the fact he still needed a cane to walk 3 or 4 weeks after being shot on Ellen.  It&#39;s as fucked as the new mexico compound story.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t meant to be a suicide mission. He shot the fuel tanks, they didn&#39;t explode, he decided &quot;fuck it I&#39;m gonna do as much of the plan as I can&quot; and then when cops were closing in he gave up. Or the other shooter in the room shot him, staged it to look like a suicide, and then left because he/she knew they wouldn&#39;t get out alive without a patsy. </p>
