<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inspector-general-report-trump-involved-in-fbi-headquarters-decision/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inspector-general-report-trump-involved-in-fbi-headquarters-decision/</a></p>

<p>The Trump administration abruptly canceled a planned FBI headquarter move, years after plans had been started and made. The plan was to move from a downtown location to a suburban location. The administration&#39;s excuse that this contract was &#39;a bad deal,&#39; and that the original location could be demolished and rebuilt for cheaper. Conveniently, the existing FBI headquarters is right across the street from a Trump Hotel, which sees significant amounts of FBI-related business. It turns out that the administration&#39;s plan to completely rebuild instead of move was lowballed. An internal investigation into this matter (due to the potential conflict of interested) revealed that his administration officials gave intentionally misleading information as to how much influence Trump had on this decision. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This week the Inspector General (IG) of the General Services Investigation (GSA) issued a report which found that, despite previous denials, President Trump was personally involved in the decision to overturn years of planning for the relocation of the FBI headquarters. That decision has a significant impact on Trump’s financial interests, given the proximity of the current headquarters to the Trump International Hotel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looks like more corruption from the administration as Trump wastes taxpayer dollars and makes political decisions to benefit his brand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again read what was posted. It takes years to design and build something like this. And Trump threw that out the window because he makes good money off the FBI Building across the street.</p>

<p>They have to re-design the building for the new site. Demo it in a downtown are (a nightmare for doing so) and then build a new one. He just put them years and hundreds of thousands if not millions behind where they were before he came along. </p>

<p>In both scenarios, a new building is built. For one of them, a building has to be demolished first and all construction takes place in a cramped downtown area. How is this cheaper?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>with this comment you have lost any credibility as an independent seeker of truth - he was supposed to stay out of the process, his people all lied to cover the fact that he was involved in it, the decision he forced caused the project to become more expensive and wasted money already invested in the process, and he personally will profit from the decision he forced. you clearly have no understanding how big of a deal it is to have that building across the street from your business, and didnt bother to research any of this before spouting off your feelings. you love trump, we get it.</p>

<p>for me on the the other hand, i call bullshit out when i see it no matter who is the messenger - like when obama said &quot;if you like your doctor you can keep him&quot;, i knew he was lying and i knew that he knew he was lying, many people were going to have to change doctors and health plans, he should have just been honest about the negative aspects of the new health care system.</p>
