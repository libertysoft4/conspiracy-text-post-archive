    <div class="md"><p>i don&#39;t mean to appear coarse... but it is the that line of thinking that has enabled us to decimate the planet, set up false idols, and participate in perpetual war without regard to anything but man. We need to see the mandelbrot. it is ALL imperative. from proton to solar flare... it all happens so the rest of it can work. </p>

<p>we dont have to agree on whether higherups are human or not to understand they consider themselves superior. mythology would tell us they are descended from odin and vlad the impaler, as well as julius caesar. thing is.... so are we.</p>

<p>We have the same piece of God, we have souls, we have infinite imaginations, and moreover... we have EONS of service, i.e. enslavement, EONS of worship, i.e work, which translates to abilities beyond their own. </p>

<p>once we level the technology playing field, by gaining access to their tech... looking at you cicada wannabes, they WILL lose. </p>

<p>Now, to not repeat history by thinking ourselves GODS may be the next step. They clearly fucking blew it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of it is intentional, as in people here paid to foment discourse and division within a group of people who all want to get down to brass tacks.  </p>

<p>I think that&#39;s partially why the SJW issue exists, seemingly off topic but I think is relevant.  SJW&#39;s are about shaming people and it fits perfectly with how we&#39;re programmed to be eternally critical of each other.  Shaming others for thinking a certain unpopular way.  It&#39;s an online movement largely anonymous, so its easy to shill from there.  Basically its another tool for division, to keep up a perception that the population is always settling a debate that can never be won, usually its between &quot;absolute idiots&quot; who want everyone to have polio and dead children everywhere like anti-vaxxers vs. the rest of the world, for example.  Just take your vaccine and don&#39;t be one of them, that kind of thinking.</p>

<p>This extends here with real users who are pre-programmed to shun and slander/insult anyone who doesn&#39;t conform.  Then there are the shills who are certainly here to keep a certain level of discontent with the users.  It&#39;s especially easy when half the country are idiots for voting in orange baby man, and the other are the righteous enlightened people who would flourish without the fools on the other side, clearly</p>

<p>If both sides weren&#39;t being played, it would be sorta funny.  Instead, everyone is being played.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracies are nothing without detractors. Even the best sourced conspiracies have flaws, by working through why x, y, or z isn&#39;t possible or hasn&#39;t been solved for we can find the answers and build a better picture of the conspiracy.</p>

<p>&#39;Question everything&#39; doesn&#39;t mean &#39;question the official narrative,&#39; it means question literally everything.</p>

<p>If I say that the real conspiracy regarding the human race is that cows used to be our secret overlords before they got used to having a relatively good life by making us their servants until all generations of cow left no longer remember that they have ultimate power over us, I fully expect to be questioned. </p>

<p>It&#39;s true by the way, Matt Stone alluded to this in his Emmy-Award winning documentary. Industrial slaughter of cows has only been allowed for the last hundred years, while cows themselves have enslaved us for thousands of years. They forgot their power and I am personally terrified for the day they regain their knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If your theory can&#39;t stand up to an attack by someone that believes something objectively crazier than you, how is your theory going to ever be believed by a wider audience?</p>

<p>What is the point of the truth in a conspiracy, if everyone rejects the theory due to glaring flaws that those pushing the theory cannot explain and do not work with others to explain?</p>

<p>Moon Landing Hoax is clearly a CIA psyop to influence conspiracy theorists into believing the government has far more power than it actually does. </p>

<p>That is an attack on that theory, and likely a valid one given the history of the theory and the early proponents, not allowing attacks like that, especially if the point is true, then only emboldens more people to fall for the psyop, harming the community when it comes to more tangible, provable theories like certain elite sex rings (though likely not the ones run out of a pizza shop&#39;s non-existent basement.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are conspiracies, and there is flat nonsense.</p>

<p>A conspiracy is whether governments have been hiding basic truths; it is interesting and worth discussing. That is both necessary and interesting. </p>

<p>Nonsense is people who claim that 1+1=5. They deny science as a method. </p>

<p>The difficulty with the latter is that it is impossible to build up an argument with the people who deny logic. Flat earth people fall on that category. </p>

<p>There is two sorts of anti vaxxers. </p>

<p>1) There are those that believe there is a conspiracy where an interested party (big companies) pushes drugs to further their own profits. I am all ears for a good discussion on that. </p>

<p>2) there are those who don’t believe in science. I have no time for that.</p>

<p>You must be able to discuss conspiracies rationally using logic; otherwise we won’t be able to separate the chaff and the wheat. </p>
