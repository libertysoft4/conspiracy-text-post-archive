        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So i took many theories i red on the net and after gathering many infos on the net and assembling the puzzle here is what i found : </p>

<p>the craziest Conspiracy theory about alien.</p>

<p>So this one wants to explain us why the fermi paradox do actually exist and why we haven&#39;t be officialy contacted yet.</p>

<p>At the beginning of everything there is an organism which is the universe and you could call it God because it has a mind and a might. It is the receptacle of physic laws. And this organism is an infinite cycle which expands and  then comes back to it&#39;s original form to expand again. Every form of life is part of it. However there are 2 kinds of forms of life :</p>

<p>Healthy form of life : those respect the universe and nature. They seems to take care of planets ecosystems and help and respect every form of life. This form of life is benefical for the health of the universe they are preserved in the universe because of the benefice they bring. The universe keep the memories of the healthy forms of life as an anticorpse against viruses. Memories of beings which are considered beneficial are kept and when they die their memories and counsiousness are preserved and transfered into a new vessel. God/ the universe preserves what preserves it and makes it healthy.</p>

<p>Unhealthy form of life : those who don&#39;t respect the universe nature and ecosystems. Those care for selfishness and personnal interests without even considering actions of their predation behaviour. Those are considered as viruses and parasites. Their memorries aren&#39;t preserved until they are cured from their illeness. When they die memmories are erased to hope that the new memmory will be better.</p>

<p>The universe is full of life and many races have became extremely advanced civilisations. Most advanced healthy forms if life civs have gathered into an intergalactic alliance which has 2 main objectives. Protect the universe and erase dangerous threats for the planets  and the universe.</p>

<p>Here is the problem. Humanoids are one of the family of multiple races in the universe. There is not only the human race but many humanoid races which share common ancestors. For example neandertal could be considered as a humanoid race which differs from humans.</p>

<p>Some humanoid races reached what we called illumination which is the state where a civilisation is defined as a healthy form of life.</p>

<p>Humans however were a really big issue. They had a huge empire and this empire&#39;s capital was Mars. The martian empire was based on those things :</p>

<p>Oligarchy, elitism, slavery, capitalism without regulation, expansion, conquering, wars for power and ressources and finally luxure and pleasure. Humans were territorialists when they evoluated they became more proeminent to the conception of possessivity to the point they were able to kill themselves to obtain what they wanted. </p>

<p>There is a rupture point for all civilisations in history which define if they are gonna turn into a healthy form of life or a universal virus kind of life. The robotic industry. When a civ reachs a certain technological point robots will  be able to make all the production. Here is the question what will do the rest of the population if they don&#39;t work anymore ?</p>

<p>Healthy forms of life answers like this : supression of elits every people in the population becomes a researcher improving society, logistics, robotics and studying the universe. Even if elits are supressed hierarchy still exists to organise roles.</p>

<p>Unhealthy forms of life answers like this :
Elits keep the privilege of robotics for themselves with lobbies. They will not let the robotic industry replace workers because it would be the end of their privileges instead they make the population their slaves with capitalism and lobbies.</p>

<p>At the beginning the martian empire wasn&#39;t a real danger for the intergalactic alliance. However they became way more aggressive. They expanded fast, reproduced fast and their technological evolution was exponential. They reached a point where they began to attack healthy life forms civs with success.</p>

<p>The intergalactic alliance decide to wipe off the martian empire :</p>

<p>That is the story of Noah and the great flood. Humans became arrogants to the point we began to be annoying for the universe (God) and then healthy forms of life civs wiped off the martian empire..</p>

<p>Humans were exterminated however the intergalactic civilisation decided to not commit a full genocide why ?</p>

<p>Some rich humans and elits were aware of human condition. They decided for the sake of mankind to supress their emotions. They wanted find a cure to its bad nature. They removed specific parts of their brain to not be affected by emotions anymore.</p>

<p>Those humans without emotions didn&#39;t feel the need to reproduce, to eat material food or to go out anymore. With time millions of years passed (they had technology for eternal life) : They lost their genital organs, their digestive system which changed a lot and their air because they didn&#39;t used or needed them anymore. The eyes became bigger because they conducted experimentd and wirked a lot in the darkness.</p>

<p>Those humans are what we could call today the Greys those are humans which supressed their humanity in order to save mankind itself.</p>

<p>The intergalatic alliance accepted to let them survive in condition that their experiments didn&#39;t endanger other forms of life.</p>

<p>So when the intergalactic alliance destroyed life on Mars a Huge mothership escaped with the greys. The only hope for mankind. Noahs ark.</p>

<p>Those escaped with a sample of dna of their ancestors and of every original specie from their home planet (animal dna). Noahs ark with 2 animal of each specie. A giant spaceship with dna samples of male and female from each speciesm</p>

<p>They decided to modify human&#39;s ancestor dna to see if the human nature could be changed. Then they decided that earth would be the home of the experiment. They introduced the human&#39;s ancestor dna and watched humanity evoluating from the monkey to the human learning and watching trying to find cures for the human nature. They tryed to teach humans what god/the universe is. They tried to intriduce laws and restrictions to humans to see if they could repress their bad nature. They abduct people to get sample and to see how their experiment goes on.</p>

<p>If the experiment is a failure they will wipe off mankind and start over again until they have good result. That is the Apocalypse.</p>

<p>The moon is the laboratory abd the base of the greys. Is this the guardian of the prison calked earth. Mankind is one of the most dangerous and violent race of the entire universe. Our solar system is strictly controlled by the grey and the intergalactic alliance.</p>

<p>Because of that it is prohibited to contact humans and greys will not allow humans to colonise the stars. We are in prisonnthat&#39;s why no one is allowed to contact us.</p>

<p>When the moon landing hapenned elites learnt the truth and were divised by the subject. Some were saying that greys were doing good and some were saying that the intergalactic alliance had no rights to do this that it was humans that should choose their own destiny.</p>

<p>Secret would be kept because it would be too horrible for majority of the population to accept human nature.</p>

<p>That is one of the scariest theories on the net fir sure. It seem more like it is impossible. But what if it was a true theory o.O ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you have sources for which points ?</p>

<p>I&#39;d enjoy reading some backed up information about Martian Empires being wiped out by a Galactic Council.</p>

<p>And how we can find technology for everlasting life, even though wouldn&#39;t that ruin the point of meeting God?</p>

<p>I guess God meets with Aliens in person, but on Earth you need to die first?</p>

(Not to mention civilizations from around the planet all have a great flood in their lore, from approximately the same time, and this flood is an actual flood of water that occurred about 12,000-12,500 years ago, here on earth). The word &quot;flood&quot; wouldn&#39;t be used by an advanced civilization under attack from a stronger (perhaps more advanced?) civilization.

    <div class="md"><p>my best guess at what op is talking about would be something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another way to measure Ω is to do so geometrically by measuring an angle across the observable universe. We can do this by using the CMB and measuring the power spectrum and temperature anisotropy. For an intuition, one can imagine finding a gas cloud that is not in thermal equilibrium due to being so large that light speed cannot propagate the thermal information. Knowing this propagation speed, we then know the size of the gas cloud as well as the distance to the gas cloud, we then have two sides of a triangle and can then determine the angles</p>
</blockquote>

<p>from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe#Curvature_of_the_universe">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe#Curvature_of_the_universe</a></p>

<p>basically what you&#39;d be doing is finding a giant triangle that stretches across the universe (with yourself the observer as one of the vertices), and then figuring out if the angles forming the triangle are greater, less, or equal to 180 degrees. so it&#39;s definitely one hell of a project...</p>

<p>the difficulty seems to come from needing to have a VERY large triangle. maybe op has a different method in mind? something that complicates things is that the space around earth is curved due to its mass, so trying to do something cool with lasers and triangles on  or around the planet would measure that local curvature more than the curvature of the universe.</p>

<p>im by no means an expert, i just watch youtube videos and shit, so perhaps there are possibilities i&#39;m not realizing :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can observe relative motion by observing Balmer hydrogen absorption lines. The wavelength &quot;shifts&quot; based on the relative motion of the body (star) to us. This shift is called the Doppler Effect. You have heard of red shift and blue shift I hope. Red shift is observed when the star is moving away from us. The wavelength is getting longer. Blue shift is when the star is moving closer to us. The wavelength is getting shorter.</p>

<p>It works the same way as sound really. </p>

<p>Stand on a straight road, in the middle. Have a car drive at a constant speed down this road while you stand there and listen. When the car is moving towards you the sound is &quot;compressed&quot; (shorter wavelength, high pitched sound) and when the car is moving away from you the sound is &quot;elongated&quot; (longer wavelength, low pitched sound). Since a high pitched sound has a short wavelength, and a low pitched sound has a long wavelength, we can actually hear the Doppler effect.</p>

You said that there is an experiment that with a little effort, can allow us to verify that the universe will expand indefinitely.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s completely disingenuous to imply that a layman can verify for themselves that the red-shift of galaxies correlates to their distance from Earth. Requires instrumentation to both measure the degree of red shift and to determine the distance of the object. I think you&#39;re being deeply intellectually dishonest on this point.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think your wider point is nearly as solid as you think it is. We don&#39;t even know yet if most of the mass that we think makes up the universe even really exists. We don&#39;t understand how quantum mechanics and gravitation relate to each other. We know just enough about the universe to know for sure that we don&#39;t know close to everything, and that some of our working assumptions are wrong. We are absolutely not in a position to say that the universe will keep expanding forever, for sure. </p>

<p>However, you are correct that the prevailing assumption is that a Big Crunch will not occur. This doesn&#39;t obviate the possibility of cyclical universes. Look into the fecund universe hypothesis and what Rodger Penrose sees in the CMB, or even the possibility of a vacuum fluctuation catastrophy popping the universe like a soap bubble and setting up for the next cycle. </p>

<p>The universe&#39;s ability to surprise us is as-of-yetuch greater than out ability to understand and predict it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my mundane idea. The universe will expand, and expand, and trillions upon trillions of years from now when the heat death has taken it toll, a random fluctuation in the fabric of the void may bring on another &quot;big bang&quot;. It&#39;s not cyclical, but likely repeating. This also could explain the accelerating expansion - old, cold mass way way beyond the CMB (cosmic background radiation) may attract the new mass and we might have no way of verifying it.</p>

<p>And yes you can observe the doppler effect by your own, and calculate an approximate red shift for distant objects. Is it quick and easy? No, but real knowledge rarely is. The more hands-on knowledge you want, the harder you&#39;d need to work. However, it&#39;s relatively easy to follow (basically) the step by step information available to observe and calculate the red shift. What&#39;ll surprise you, as it surprised the pioneers, is that the further away you get, the more red shifted galaxies become. They are moving away from us quicker than galaxies nearer to us (universally). In fact, you wont find any far away galaxies that blue shifts - at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I think you&#39;re still being pretty intellectually dishonest. </p>

<p>I&#39;d not be surprised that the further away a galaxy is telling more red-shifted it is. I speak to this in my reply, actually. It&#39;s a big part of why what you are proposing isn&#39;t remotely feasible. Determining the distance of galaxies is even more difficult for the amateur astronomer. You have to go off of candle stars if the galaxy is close enough, or catch a supernova if it isn&#39;t. This is absolutely not the thing someone can just sit down and do themselves from a cold start. I truly don&#39;t think you yourself understand how involved what you are proposing actually is, as you don&#39;t really seem to be cognizant of the fact that the would-be-researcher would need to measure red-shift <em>and</em> distance themselves to demonstrate anything meaningful. </p>

<p>Your &quot;real knowledge never is&quot; dodge is dishonest. This requires much more than a bit of effort you originally billed it as. It&#39;s going to take a while fuckload of study and time and money and instrumentation and effort for someone to do this. </p>

<p>But is is possible, yes. And almost for certain that the results would be what you predict. But it wouldn&#39;t mean what you say it means. All galaxies moving away from us does not guarantee that the universe isn&#39;t cyclical, we don&#39;t understand the universe well enough to say that. </p>

<li>If you consider the possibility that our brain could be understood as a quantum computer using spinning electromagnetic waves (brain wabes) to compute while using neuron&#39;s (even down to their DNA using <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258215957_Mosaic_Copy_Number_Variation_in_Human_Neurons">viruses</a> neural network structure as hard drive, it changes what we may consider &quot;life&quot;. Could a conciousness made of spinning EMF energy find a home in the ionosphere of the earth (Schumann Resonances) a la Alexa? </li>
</ol>

<p>If you consider that, then the idea that the universe is itself <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/01/23/ask-ethan-is-the-universe-itself-alive/#5271937e31bb">alive</a> might not be as kooky.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Assuming no conciousness from 1, yup thats what would happen. But if you consider conciousness could be stored in energy, would it allow itself to slowly fade into obscurity? Or might it try to self propagate, some may say one of the driving principles of life.</p></li>
<li><p>Definitely never has a for sure answer. But, what if healthy / unhealthy is determined much in the same way as a garden, what&#39;s the most likely outcome of that entity existing, will it help life or harm life, do they feel intuitively &quot;good&quot;. Except this would be the entire galaxy simultaneously, a wisdom of the crowds approach.</p></li>
<li><p>Yeah I think he got part of this wrong, I think the 12600 or so year ago catastrophe was real and probably a combination comet + solar flare. If it was big enough to <a href="https://newatlas.com/meteorites-asteroids-ancient-planets/55299/">break up a planet</a> it could&#39;ve done quite a number on a civilization. Also I think that a spiritually delivered message from a possibly guilty party to a few primitive listening people on earth seems more likely. A few refugees following with the fear of God struck in them after.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>5&amp;6 yeah I think the grays might be an offshoot of humans, and is definitely an interesting proposition. I&#39;m not sure about the eyes etc, but another explanation would be it would make things like <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02391-6">this</a> easier to implement. They&#39;re often talked about as empty vessels, in a way it might make sense that they are extremely genetically manipulated humanoids (although they may be absolutely ancient) to the point where they&#39;re more like puppets to jump into than beings that are able to embody a soul consistently, meaning a self generated spinning coherent EMF wave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah seriously, this is good old fun fringe conspiracy theory here. You can&#39;t get to these ideas if you are over concerned with the logistics of every little detail. High speculation is fun from time to time. Also if you know about all the anomalies about the moon&#39;s very existence and the trace amounts of seemingly man-made nuclear fallout found on Mars back in the 70&#39;s, it&#39;s even more interesting.

    <div class="md"><p>I really think UFOs should be a much larger part of this sub. It&#39;s the biggest conspiracy theory out there, by far. The thing that bothers me is when someone claims there is no evidence</p>

<p>There are so many witnesses and military whistleblowers, police whistleblowers, etc. Way too many to count. There are government documents, government studies, etc. Many high ranking people have come out already, but it seems like the average person just isn&#39;t getting the memo. Maybe it&#39;s too difficult to sift through all of the disinformation, so they give up early and never actually seek out the evidence and testimony. The other issue is how decentralized all of the UFO stuff is. It&#39;s scattered all over the net, so it takes a while to actually research the subject. It&#39;s kinda like sifting dirt in search of gold nuggets. Finding the occasional nugget makes it very worthwhile.</p>

<p>Here is a presentation of the above by Stanton Friedman: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr8t3sGxAlw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr8t3sGxAlw</a></p>

<p>Military whistleblowers regarding UFOs over nuclear installations: Military Witnesses of UFOs at Nuclear Sites--Press Conference <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v737aqOJ2fs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v737aqOJ2fs</a></p>

<p>Another military whisteblower of many: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOwhJ4fJoWk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOwhJ4fJoWk</a> (UFO crash in Peru)</p>

<p>You will find many more whistleblowers. High ranking, credible whistleblowers started coming out I think around 2008, and it has been ramping up, so there is plenty out there now to find if you are just getting started. </p>

<p>Something to think about is the national security aspect of this. The reason this stuff is classified is because we don&#39;t want some country like North Korea or some group like Al Qaeda to get a hold of advanced tech. I think that&#39;s the initial reason why the government came up with a cover story after they announced to the media they recovered an alien flying saucer at Roswell. They just held back all of that information, and we are at the point today that they can&#39;t even admit we are being visited because it would cause so much uproar. They&#39;d have to admit to lying to us all of these years, so we can&#39;t expect them to admit it. It&#39;s just going to be a long process of all of these high ranking officials tricking out until everyone is up to speed on the situation. They say the government can&#39;t keep a secret very long, that someone would leak the information. Well, there&#39;s a mountain of leaks already, with more to come. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, if you take Bismuth (element #83), the most diamagnetic element we know of, and add a full quantum level (one row down on periodic table of elements) of electrons/neutrons/protons, 32, you get 83+32=115, recognize that element?</p>

<p>If you take Bismuths properties and extrapolate, think order of magnitude stronger diamagnetic fields. Input more energy (electricity), increases the diamagnetic field, direct the flow using magnets = thrust.</p>

<p>Coincidence? Sure. But our current understanding of quantum physics says that you have a probability of appearing on Mars. </p>

<p>The above explanation relies on an understanding built off of a unified theory of physics (no not any of the mainstream or pseudo science ones like holoverse or whatever). But that&#39;s probably for a different post.</p>

<p>Also....element 115 used to be called UnUnPentium (UuP)

    <div class="md"><p>Pseudoscience because it makes untestable predictions. I&#39;d say many &quot;mainstream&quot; theories are criticized for the same just reason, like string theory or multiverse etc.</p>

<p>Separately I think is the concept of complexity, that the truth will be explained by the smallest number of rules (in it the beauty imo many scientist feel when seeing patterns). All theories except one fail in this regard, and not saying that is proof but is definitely worth noting.</p>

<p>The coincidence is that element 115 is the element Bob Lazar claimed powered the recovered UFOs. His interpretation of it is wrong, or well, not fully shaped by reality (not his fault just the best way we have at explaining that observed phenomenon then)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>many thanks for this post.</p>

<p>it is what i needed to know.</p>

<p>I think they used bismuth in the early 50&#39;s 60&#39;s to test discs by Thomas Townsend Brown, and his colleagues.</p>

<p>They called the effect they discovered, the biefeld brown effect, a form of electrogravitics </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biefeld%E2%80%93Brown_effect">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biefeld%E2%80%93Brown_effect</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrogravitics">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrogravitics</a></p>

<p>B2 and further on probably uses a bismuth / metal alloy which creates the desired effect imho.</p>

<p>This stuff is going to be really BIG in the future, hope i see them hoverboards fly around the neighbourhood one day. (¬‿¬)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, just keep in mind there are many many people who have stumbled on similar effects, and when unable to explain them using traditional theories so they turned to their own mental gymnastics (interpretation) in order to explain it.</p>

<p>There is a unified theory that explains all these effects simply, but sadly it&#39;s been ignored by both the scientific mainstream (duh) AND the &quot;alternative&quot; sources where things like holoverse have become popular.</p>

<p>My advice to start interpreting things right is to understand 3D matter is a standing wave of energy with hollow inside. According to entropy we know things flow from high concentration to low concentration, energy is no exception. So if matter has a hollow inside what happens when a bunch of energy is outside, would it truly to flow into the zero point space, thereby creating a force?
And interesting links! I&#39;ll probably digest them and make a model or two (the unified theory allows you to understand electron orbitals from the bottom up, so I&#39;m interested in seeing how they give rise to the observed phenomena you linked)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t researched this myself yet, but I suspect the &quot;UFO era&quot; began after national militaries greatly exceeded the capabilities of ordinary civilian aviation. That may have begun in the late 1940&#39;s to the 1950&#39;s, when jet engines became common on military aircraft. My hypothesis would be that greater time spent in the sky, with increasingly unfamiliar aircraft (new, experimental, etc) is the sole reason for authentic UFO sightings. More time in the sky means people see natural things that have always been there, but were unnoticed before, and the obviously technological things are all man-made.</p>

<p>With more research, I think I would probably learn UFO sightings pretty much never happened before aviation became common. Even in cases where there were sightings of strange things, they would all be natural or artificial Earth-bound things, not aliens. Like comets, supernovas, meteors, and unusual weather effects like ball lightning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don’t crash often. There have been an insane number of UFO reports over the years. A few of them crashed. One was due to some kind of powerful radar that we started using. This interferes with their instruments and it causes the crash. Another was shot down. After one of them crashes, the government can reverse engineer them, figure out how they work, then come up with possible ways to shoot them down. Who knows, maybe one alien race shot down another UFO or two. </p>

<p>There are also whistleblowers who claim the government is working with at least one alien race. These aliens would be able to tell us how to shoot down another craft. </p>

<p>I also wouldn’t say these other aliens would be light years ahead of us. There is probably a limit to how intelligent a 5 or 6 foot being can get. If they were only slightly smarter than us, but they’ve had 1,000 years to technologically advance, then they would be able to build some cool stuff. But to think they are akin to gods, like 900 IQ beings is not accurate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pat, first thanks for sharing your theory, I found it interesting and loosely plausible. I really don’t know why all the posts seem to be hating. You have a disclaimer at the beginning about the grammar and spelling, and still others are criticizing. I also thought it was pretty clear this was your theory, pasting together many other people’s work into your own working theory, and that a large portion was based on Eisenhower’s daughters thoughts. Anyway, I do agree with the criticism that who and how does the universe distinguish what is healthy and unhealthy? I do find it very plausible that humans are very destructive and could be on the verge of another extinction, unless we change for the better pretty quick. Again, I enjoyed reading your take.</p>

<p>Consider this: NASA claims we are rotating at 1,000 mph around the equator, 66,600 mph around the sun, 514,000 mph around the galactic center, etc... and yet the atmosphere just floats along with us an nobody feels the movement!?

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so how strong would gravity have to be to overcome the centripetal force of rotation (1,000+ mph around the axis at the equator), revolution around the sun (66,600 mph), revolution around the galactic center (514,000 mph), plus any other motion the galaxy takes? It makes no sense that smoke from a fire would easily overcome this same force. </p>

<p>Furthermore, with all of that rotation and revolution in mind, how is it that human have seen the same constellations in the sky for thousands of years?</p>

<p>No gravity is a theory to explain why object fall to earth. No one has proven that mass inherently attracts mass absent the influence of electromagnetism and density.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Smoke is less dense than air, which is why it rises. You gotta think about both the gravity and density of each part within the system together to get a full understanding. If you&#39;re only ever addressing one aspect of one part at a time then you&#39;ll never be able to understand how the whole system works. Due to the lack of change in the earth&#39;s rotation centripetal force is negligible, since it&#39;s effectively a constant. Basically, everything on earth is already used to the earth&#39;s rotation, so nothing is gonna go flying off into space unless that suddenly changes, which it theoretically shouldn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Smoke is less dense than air, which is why it rises.&quot; Absolutely, which is why we need no theory of gravity unless you believe we live on a spinning ball. We already know that electromagnetic and frequency has the ability to attract objects and even hold them in place: 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=669AcEBpdsY">acoustic levitation</a></p>

<p>We are talking about a force that is so strong it keeps barely dense air at the top of the atmosphere from dissipating into space (with no barrier) while moving at over 1/2 million mph. Surely you can see the discrepancy?
The smoke is able to rise near earth where gravity is supposedly strongest, yet less dense air in the stratosphere just floats along with us as if tethered to the earth.</p>

<p>&quot;Basically, everything on earth is already used to the earth&#39;s rotation, so nothing is gonna go flying off into space&quot; - We are talking about a constant change in velocity but not in the same direction-inertia would not prevent us feeling the acceleration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I forgot to address that last bit. But gravity isn&#39;t a theory that explains why things fall to earth. It isn&#39;t an explanation of anything. Einstein&#39;s theory of general and special relativity <em>describes</em> what gravity is doing, and how it effects mass. It doesn&#39;t give any explanation as to its source or give any reason as to why it exists. It theorises that it is the effect that the curvature of spacetime itself has on mass, which currently seems to fit what we see on the macro scale. It&#39;s not perfect and it&#39;s not proven. It doesn&#39;t line up with the theory of quantum mechanics, which describes what things are doing on the micro scale. It&#39;s just a theory.<br/>
Some day in the future someone will come along and unify quantum physics and general relativity, and that&#39;ll make each theory look like the scribblings of a child. I hope that day should be soon. </p>

How people dont interact with one another anymore unless theyre on their devices communicating digitally or what not and how they forgotten how to talk but to communicate telepathically. Pupils dilated from led screens caused our eyes to grow bigger like the greys and how easier it was to access knowledge online causing our head to grow and body to shrink.

    <div class="md"><p>Theres a lot in there I agree with but there is a lot that I think it misses. </p>

<p>I doubt mars was ever the center of a large space fearing civilization, maybe an outpost, but imo I think a far likelier location for a capital is what probably was a planet which is now the <a href="https://newatlas.com/meteorites-asteroids-ancient-planets/55299/">asteroid belt</a>. With possibly the same event affecting mars.</p>

<p>Also, I think that our definition of life is myopic. If you consider our brain as a quantum computer spinning electromagnetic waves (brain waves) and having them interfere thereby leading to decisions, actions, and feelings, could a conciousness exist in the cloud Alexa style?</p>

<p>If you then rejigger your understanding of consciousness, and consider the possibility that species may be able to &quot;live&quot; in the ionosphere of planets (think Schumann resonances), planets like Jupiter may be far more important when considering what&#39;s really going on instead of the moon or Mars. This connects with all the first chunk about the cosmos, and I think that&#39;s all likely right, and I&#39;d say faithfully echos the Law of One.</p>

<p>Also, consider if the earth was seeded ~541 million years ago (cambrian explosion), aka directed panspermia. That would mean that things stretch very far back.</p>

<p>Really nice summary and pretty good coherence in logic. Although for the ark, I&#39;m not sure that had to be a spaceship or anything as exotic, if you believe the stuff above, it could just have been part of the alliance feeling guilty and delivering a message to a few people &quot;listening&quot; (spiritually connected). This lines up far better with our mythology and genetics of animals on Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting theory. It gets a little &quot;out there&quot; but it&#39;s good to entertain ideas.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve thought about humans being a sort of &quot;virus&quot; to the Earth before, but I haven&#39;t thought about how certain beings could be like good bacteria or bad bacteria to the actual universe in its entirety. </p>

<p>That&#39;s fascinating to think about, because I actually do believe that the universe and everything inside of it is one living organism with many different components, and is composed of a fundamental, absolute, omnipresent, omniscient force known as consciousness, which resides in everything to varying degrees. This force is why we are able to be self-aware obviously. And I think that our memories from all of our lifetimes, otherwise known as our personal identity, could possibly be encoded into this consciousness holographically.</p>

<p>So, it&#39;s quite interesting to me to think that the universe might contain &quot;good bacteria&quot;, or people who treat the universe and everything in it with compassion and respect - and try to improve things through teaching right thought and actions. </p>

<p>And the people who are selfish and do not treat the universe and all of its aspects with respect, could be viewed as bad bacteria.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got a problem with it right away in your definition of your two camps of respect/disrespect for the environment. This is a purely human idea, respect, something that doesn&#39;t actually exist outside of our concept of it. Animals don&#39;t &#39;respect&#39; their environment; they eat and fuck as much as they can until something else in their ecosystem stops them, be it a hurricane or a bigger predator, virus outbreak, whatever. </p>

<p>We as people look at the result and think, &#39;wow such balance&#39; but it&#39;s pretty much the opposite. It&#39;s a big play of who can get away with satisfying their needs the longest before they are checked by another power. People have been able to survive because, through their sense of cooperation they can overcome their environment, and these sorts of ideas like respect and order emerge, but it would be a mistake to, sort of &#39;overlay&#39; these ideas on the animals around us. Except maybe for your family dog. Definitely not the cat lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean disrespecting nature in this way : because you are intelligent you are different from average nature you can go beyond the usual natural lifetime span limit that every specie has. Because of that you can alter how virgin nature develops. Because of anthropy you can decide to eradicate lions because you just don&#39;t like them what you are doing is wiping off a specie just because you don&#39;t like it. Normally without your acts it would continue to live naturally. But because we are able to think we are able to break natural steps of life. For example if one day we will able to gather antimatter we would brake the nature cycle completely by destroying it. If add Co2 in your atmisphere it is not a natural phenomenum it is due to anthropy.</p>

<p>A healthy form of life is a form of life that its anthropy tries at maximum to not disturb natural (natures and wildeness) processes. Those forms of life try to live like if their way of living would not impact their environnememt or minimise at maximum the side effects. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bingo. The worst are the people that incessantly quote shit like Agent Smith from the Matrix as if it was some profound thought. I just gotta roll my eyes because it shows such a fundamental divorce from the reality of nature. Especially in my area literally all you have to do is open your backdoor -- and i&#39;m not living in anything that could be deemed wilderness. A perfect example across a wide swathe of North America is deer. In many areas we&#39;ve eliminated their natural competition and the end result is anything but &#39;harmony&#39; they fuck, their numbers explode, they strip the land bare, and they all starve to death -- unless kept in check by hunting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the theory but I want see where you compiled your information from. However I can tell you that I&#39;ve heard similar things in what you described. In the CIA remote viewing of Mars. The Origin of Evil by Micheal Tsarion. Mauro Biglino describes some stuff regarding Alien Visitation. They usually end up referring to Atlantis as having something to do with the origin of humanity.Coincidentally in an excerpt from The Secret Teachings of All Ages by Manly P Hall, says this, &quot;ATLANTIS is the subject of a short but important article appearing in the Annual Report 
of the Board of Regents of The Smithsonian Institution for the year ending June 30th, 
1915. The author, M. Pierre Termier, a member of the Academy of Sciences and Director 
of Service of the Geologic Chart of France, in 1912 delivered a lecture on the Atlantean 
hypothesis before the Institut Océanographique; it is the translated notes of this 
remarkable lecture that are published in the Smithsonian report. 
&quot;After a long period of disdainful indifference,&quot; writes M. Termier, &quot;observe how in the 
last few years science is returning to the study of Atlantis. How many naturalists, 
geologists, zoologists, or botanists are asking one another today whether Plato has not 
transmitted to us, with slight amplification, a page from the actual history of mankind.&quot; 
Graham Hancock speaks of Ancient Structureso to show that there was an Advanced Civilization in our past. Ive heard theories about Annunaki and Grey&#39;s thrown arond. But the most important thing is that you look for evidence if possible and you don&#39;t just stop where you are keep searching for the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re very warm, OP. But humans are far from the most violent creatures in the solar system. Humans beings are a very young species, and we&#39;re being fought over from both sides, from a beautiful (psychedelic) race of aliens for our evolution, and from a very nefarious group of grays/archons/reptilians on the other. Humans can be violent, but we can also be peaceful. I hope our future is peaceful like a mushroom trip, not violent and crazy like war.</p>

<p>I&#39;m dead serious, and this comes from a lifetime of searching for the truth. Read:</p>

<p>-Joseph Farrell, &quot;The Cosmic War.&quot; Seriously, read this book. Here&#39;s a taste of Farrell:</p>

<p>-John Lash, &quot;Not in HIS Image&quot; about the early Gnostics</p>

<p>-Richard Dolan, &quot;UFO&#39;s and the National Security State&quot; </p>

<p>-Graham Hancock, &quot;Magicians of the Gods&quot;</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>And perhaps most importantly, smoke DMT- especially if you have any doubts that there exist &quot;aliens&quot; at all.</p>

<p>I think you should read two things that are related and tell a similar story, but instead of being &quot;aliens,&quot; come from a different perspective. They take less of a sci-fi angle.</p>

<p>1 - The Law of One, aka The Ra Material
<a href="https://infiniteshift.wordpress.com/2014/06/06/the-law-of-one-wikipedia/">https://infiniteshift.wordpress.com/2014/06/06/the-law-of-one-wikipedia/</a> (you should be able to find it online all over the place)
This is more along the lines of spirituality and is a psychic reading of a soul group named Ra that discusses the concepts of free will</p>

<p>2 - The Hidden Hand Interview
<a href="https://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/hidden_hand_081018">https://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/hidden_hand_081018</a>
More along the lines of demonic/occult, but still about soul progression and soul groups, etc.</p>

<p>By and large the vast majority of humans are decent, caring, and socially responsible creatures if given half a chance. </p>

<p>Not saying that they can&#39;t do wrong or evil out of ignorance and fear, but they aren&#39;t entirely to blame under such circumstances and are innately driven by the basic intelligence that is their birthright to try and come to grips with and overcome that.</p>

<p>Another one do you think that us humans would accept to lower their salaries to stop disparities in the world ? No. Would we accept to only have 1 car by family ? If every country lived like occidentals we would need 4 earths to sustain life. So we occidentals are stealing ressources from developing countries to sustain inequal ways of living.</p>

<p>Human is selfish by nature. He doesn&#39;t care if others are in need or thing like that. Most of humans will say it&#39;s sad and won&#39;t act however the remaining 5% will act and those are the ones on which genetical modifications have been a success.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This world, if properly managed with the right kind of priorities could easily and comfortably support twice as many people as are presently living on it.</p>

<p>We are each born into &quot;a system&quot; and &quot;a culture&quot; we had no say or part in creating, taken as small children and thoroughly indoctrinated and inculcated to follow it&#39;s ways and accept a wide variety of beliefs without ever daring to question any of them.</p>

<p>Like I said, the wrong or evil that comes about is due primarily to fear and ignorance and the cultivation of beliefs that reflect them such as you contention that everyone is innately &quot;selfish&quot;.</p>

<p>That so-called selfishness was taken simply as &quot;a given&quot; when Von Neumann first came up with the idea of &quot;Game Theory&quot; and that the unstable John Nash did his best to prove and managed to get the US military to adopt, despite what actually took place when he tried to test it among all of the most ordinary people, secretaries and admin staff at the Rand Corp. </p>

<p>What resulted was a clear demonstration of altruism and self-sacrifice... a general and common willingness to be personally put out of the game in order to save one&#39;s team-mates and their ability to carry on and potentially win. He discounted that, of course, but that&#39;s what happened and why that theory is seriously flawed with events never quite turning out the way they are predicted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a spiritual conflict, a conflict over the way we treat others and how we want to see ourselves and others. There are two basic camps of thought. Like primitive animals, we can be self-serving machines, chasing gain, avoiding loss and calculating risk.</p>

<p>Evil is simply self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. All other things labeled evil are unfortunate experiences with causality in ignorance. Evil requires intent. </p>

<p>The other path is self-control through respect for others. It&#39;s about finding the best solution for the whole when there is a conflict of interests. This path is a choice to rise above being a mere self-serving machine and regulate behavior with others in mind, not just the self. It requires mental, social, moral and spiritual evolution.</p>

<p>I&#39;d bet that ETs all go through a period of development with selfishness. Some of them never evolve past it and fall to technology as a means of greater ease and control of others and the self. They lose their self-control to technology which then controls them. It supplants their thinking and distorts and destroys their feeling. They remain petty, obsessed with pleasure and fear, not in self-control and feeling little to no love at all. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t make what they need spiritually, satisfying experiences, so they steal satisfaction instead. They find those who do make those satisfying experiences, because they have stored emotional energy, a scarce resource for the damned, who won&#39;t produce it by being in positive emotional states. They remain in lower emotions, fear and reward, survival. They appear as bullies in behavior, which also steal this emotional energy to obtain personal satisfaction. </p>

<p>So, they become a spiritual disease, using their means, technology, knowledge and otherwise, to deceive and coerce others into giving them spiritual energy. This is done by causing negative emotions in those who create and store this energy. They also want to recruit new members to make into lower slaves to help them collect emotional energy with less effort. They have two agendas, steal energy and steal beings to help collect the energy. One is short term, the other long term.</p>

<p>Races that develop care for others have compassion for those who suffer under the influence of these insidious parasites that bring spiritual dis-ease. They try to help these people in ways that work in the long term.</p>

<p>The spiritual parasites seek to get us to emulate their way of life, so they can play us like a fiddle by using millions of years of acquired knowledge about how that way of life works. Then they know they can wield us as tools, because they already do it to their current pool of slaves. They are a disease. They feed and reproduce by exploiting others, like diseases do.</p>

<p>The ETs who choose to be responsible to others&#39; self-interests try to help people choose to be in self-control. They teach things that work toward that end. The individual has to choose to act on such advice for it to be helpful. So, they give us suggestions through covert and not so covert means to become better, more pleasant, more rewarding beings to be around. Some choose this path too, most of us do to some degree. </p>

<p>Many of us don&#39;t even realize we are making such a choice. It feels good to be good, because we love. Without love, selfishness feels good. That&#39;s why psychopaths keep choosing it. Love feels like weakness or needless vulnerability to such beings who see in competition and survival, not love and compassion.</p>

<p>We are like Syria. We are a place where these two spiritual paths play out a covert conflict. One side wants us to suffer to feed them spiritual energy and to become their slaves, to fulfill their choice to be a disease, feeding and reproducing using others. The general emotional suite they prefer for their targets is fear. </p>

<p>The side aligned with the process of creation, rather than destruction, wants us to do the opposite. They want us to choose to control ourselves and be free. They want us to create and share our own spiritual energy with free will. The general emotional suite they prefer is love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there is an Intergalactic Alliance, human beings would be the last species they would want out in the universe.</p>

<p>We murder our own kind for small benefits.  Land, money, power, religious beliefs, and sometimes because we&#39;re just blood-thirsty.  If we&#39;ll kill our own for this, we would obviously do the same if we found a weaker Alien race that we could subjugate.</p>

<p>We literally murder and eat the other inhabitants of our planet, sometimes to extinction, with little regard for their sentience.  Killing for food is nothing to us, but to an advanced Alien race, the act would probably seem quite barbaric, especially if our level of intelligence/technology is inferior to the point that we&#39;re nothing more than a herd of cows to them.</p>

<p>We have no drive for advancement that doesn&#39;t serve our own need.  If America discovered some new technology, would they share it with China?  No.  We would hoard it until we got every bit of profit out of it.  How could we be trusted to share advancements with other civilizations?  Why would they do the same for us?  We discover cures and don&#39;t share them with anyone who can&#39;t afford to pay a hefty price for the treatment.  If some theories are be believed, we go as far as to hide advancements so people will keep paying for treatment instead of the cure.</p>

<p>Controlling small plots of land (on an intergalactic scale) and minor resources (that are probably plentiful throughout the universe) are important enough to us that we commit genocide.  We commit genocide to keep people in power.  What would we do for advanced weapons, new technology, the ability to harvest unlimited energy, etc.?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean disrespecting nature in this way : because you are intelligent you are different from average nature you can go beyond the usual natural lifetime span limit that every specie has. Because of that you can alter how virgin nature develops. Because of anthropy you can decide to eradicate lions because you just don&#39;t like them what you are doing is wiping off a specie just because you don&#39;t like it. Normally without your acts it would continue to live naturally. But because we are able to think we are able to break natural steps of life. For example if one day we will able to gather antimatter we would brake the nature cycle completely by destroying it. If add Co2 in your atmisphere it is not a natural phenomenum it is due to anthropy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t researched this myself yet, but I suspect the &quot;UFO era&quot; began after national militaries greatly exceeded the capabilities of ordinary civilian aviation. That may have begun in the late 1940&#39;s to the 1950&#39;s, when jet engines became common on military aircraft. My hypothesis would be that greater time spent in the sky, with increasingly unfamiliar aircraft (new, experimental, etc) is the sole reason for authentic UFO sightings. More time in the sky means people see natural things that have always been there, but were unnoticed before, and the obviously technological things are all man-made.</p>

<p>With more research, I think I would probably learn UFO sightings pretty much never happened before aviation became common. Even in cases where there were sightings of strange things, they would all be natural or artificial Earth-bound things, not aliens. Like comets, supernovas, meteors, and unusual weather effects like ball lightning.</p>
