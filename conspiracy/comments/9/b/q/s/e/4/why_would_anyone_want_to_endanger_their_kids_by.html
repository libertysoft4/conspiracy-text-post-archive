<li>Why do you choose to believe the pharmaceutical industry instead of your neighbors? Although anecdotal, there are so many people who report problems with their kids after certain vaccines. You could search YouTube and see thousands of people&#39;s home videos of the difference in their kids. Keep in mind these were PRO-VAXXERS. They willingly took their kid to get the shots.  <a href="https://imgur.com/a/fi8Fh">https://imgur.com/a/fi8Fh</a></li>
<li>The national vaccine injury compensation program. Aka &quot;vaccine court&quot;. Pays out billions to children found to be vaccine-injured. Not with the manufacturer&#39;s money, but with taxes. Protects the manufacturer from all liability. As a citizen, you are **literally not allowed to sue a vaccine manufacturer**. Crony capitalism at its most obvious. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court</a></li>
<li>The CDC was caught hiding evidence of the MMR causing autism in African American boys. People argue that it&#39;s not enough to prove anything. But the fact that they were caught covering something up(!!!) should raise some alarm bells in people. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25377033">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25377033</a> Here&#39;s a congressman talking about the whole story on CSPAN. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTFkf_1sHVQ&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTFkf_1sHVQ&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></li>
<li>The current vaccine schedule has never been studied for its safety in its entirety. Each individual vaccine has been studied for short-term safety, but not all together. What about when they get 5 at once? No FDA tests in that regard, no studies. The CDC actually admits that they DON&#39;T study fully vaccinated vs fully unvaccinated children, and they DON&#39;T monitor for long term health problems! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTFkf_1sHVQ&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTFkf_1sHVQ&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>  (Well, actually, there was one recent small pilot study that linked vaccination with an increase in neurodevelopmental disorders...but it was pulled from the journal and &quot;erased&quot; from the internet. <a href="https://archive.fo/DC1mj">https://archive.fo/DC1mj</a>) Why can&#39;t we have larger studies asking this same question?</li>
<li>Contaminated vaccines are nothing new. Ever hear of the cancer causing SV40 virus in polio vaccines from 1955 to 1961?  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10472327">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10472327</a> This virus is being found in people&#39;s brain tumors today.</li>
<li>Many vaccines are grown in cultures using the lung cells of an aborted human fetus. Literal human cells are in vaccines. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/aborted-fetuses-vaccines/story?id=29005539">http://abcnews.go.com/Health/aborted-fetuses-vaccines/story?id=29005539</a> Religious people may have a problem with that. There are also scientists who believe these cell lines are causing problems.   <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26103708/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26103708/</a></li>
<li>Speaking of aborted fetal cells, how do we know this isn&#39;t causing autoimmune disorders? Think about it. If you&#39;re getting injected with human cells, and then forcing an immune response with an aluminum adjuvant, could that not make your body create antibodies to cellular material? </li>
<li>But vaccines work! True, but actually, disease has been on the decline either way. Polio was already on the decline because of sanitation and nutrition before the vaccine came out. Measles cases remained stable, but the death rate had plummeted to almost zero (due to better standard of living and medical care) before the vaccine came out. People had measles parties and no longer feared it. Check out this compilation of shows featuring measles back in the day. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDb0ZS3vB9g&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDb0ZS3vB9g&amp;feature=youtu.be</a> Measles was not scary.</li>
<li>It&#39;s amazing how healthy people are when they&#39;re eating well, and the children aren&#39;t working 14 hour days in the coal mines. Infectious disease overall was on the decline, and for the diseases that were still around, they were no longer fatal. Think of the diseases that are gone now without vaccines: what happened to scarlet fever and stuff? <a href="http://vaccines.procon.org/view.additional-resource.php?resourceID=005964">http://vaccines.procon.org/view.additional-resource.php?resourceID=005964</a></li>
<li>Americans, did you know that the UK does not vaccinate for chickenpox? <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/childrens-health/why-are-children-in-the-uk-not-vaccinated-against-chickenpox/">https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/childrens-health/why-are-children-in-the-uk-not-vaccinated-against-chickenpox/</a> Chickenpox is not a deadly disease (except for super immunocompromized people). Back in the day, everyone got chickenpox. Every time they were exposed to someone else who had it after that, it was like their &quot;booster&quot; shot. You didn&#39;t get shingles later, because you got your booster when you took care of your sick grandkid, for example. If a baby got sick, mom&#39;s immunities were passed to baby through her breastmilk. These days, if you&#39;ve had chickenpox, you&#39;re unlikely to be exposed since your children will be vaccinated. So without a shingles vaccine, you could get shingles. Purposely created dependency.</li>
<li>Speaking of breastfeeding, did you know that if you&#39;ve had REAL measles (or any illness), you pass on antibodies through the placenta to your baby that last several months? And you can keep protecting your baby even longer if breastfeeding. If you&#39;ve had the vaccine however, your baby is more vulnerable. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/17629601/?i=6&amp;amp;from=%2F10913406%2Frelated">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/17629601/?i=6&amp;from=%2F10913406%2Frelated</a></li>
<li>Live vaccines shed. You CAN catch mumps, measles, etc. from someone who was just recently vaccinated. That&#39;s many places like NICU&#39;s and oncology wards have a policy that recently vaccinated people may not visit. Why was it that the mumps outbreak at Harvard was ALL vaccinated people? How could they blame the source on unvaccinated students, when the only people sick were vaccinated? <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/college-game-plan/harvard-mumps-outbreak-continues-commencement-will-go-n575526">http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/college-game-plan/harvard-mumps-outbreak-continues-commencement-will-go-n575526</a> What sucks about that, is mumps is a relatively harmless illness when you&#39;re a kid. It can make you sterile if you get it as an adult. So we&#39;re vaccinating kids, the immunity wears off over time, and they become susceptible when they&#39;re older.</li>
<li>One theory behind vaccine injury is that there is a certain population with a genetic predisposition for having an autoimmune reaction after some of these shots. Until we can discover and test for it in advance, it&#39;s not fair to play Russian roulette with our kids. Another example: the MTHFR gene. People who have it have methylation issues and less glutathione, which allows you to detox. There are real doctors out there who prefer not to vaccinate children who are homozygous for MTHFR. Here&#39;s a study showing increased risk of adverse reactions to the smallpox vaccine in kids with that mutation, but that&#39;s the only study of its kind that I know of.  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18454680">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18454680</a> Why haven&#39;t we studied this in other vaccines?</li>
<li>Your annual flu shot is screwing up your immune system. You know how people get the flu shot, then they get sick? It&#39;s because according to this placebo controlled study, you are <strong>5 times more likely to catch a non-flu respiratory illness</strong> if you&#39;ve had the flu shot. Your cell-mediated immunity takes a back seat for several weeks. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/54/12/1778/455098/Increased-Risk-of-Noninfluenza-Respiratory-Virus">https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/54/12/1778/455098/Increased-Risk-of-Noninfluenza-Respiratory-Virus</a> Also, if you do happen to catch the flu despite your vaccination, you will have increased viral aerosol generation. In other words, your lungs will be so full of flu that you&#39;re not fighting properly, and you will breathe it out on the people around you, more so than an unvaccinated flu-infected person will. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/01/17/1716561115">http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/01/17/1716561115</a></li>
<li>People think vaccines causing autism is preposterous because they themselves don&#39;t understand the mechanism by which it would happen. Just because you don&#39;t understand how something happens, doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t happen. For example, check out this study linking the DTaP vaccine to childhood asthma. You might not understand how it&#39;s happening, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not happening. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/18207561/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/18207561/</a></li>
<li>Let&#39;s talk about the epidemiological studies that say vaccines don&#39;t cause autism. First of all, see #3 and #4. They don&#39;t check vaccinated vs unvaccinated kids. They choose vaccinated vs LESS vaccinated kids. Why is that important? Because of something called &quot;healthy user bias&quot;, explained here: <a href="https://imgur.com/u9G1pzQ">https://imgur.com/u9G1pzQ</a> Also if you don&#39;t know who Paul Thorsen is, you should. He&#39;s on the FBI most wanted list. He&#39;s on the run. Yet we trust him to author these pro-MMR vaccine studies?</li>
<li>Let&#39;s throw a few more facts out there about some specific shots, since this is getting lengthy. Hepatitis B is transmitted the same way as HIV, yet it&#39;s given at BIRTH to babies in the US. Are you really worried your newborn is going to be shooting up or having sex? It&#39;s a lot of aluminum for a 6 lb baby, and aluminum causes social impairments in animal studies. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0162013417304749">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0162013417304749</a> Next, hepatitis A is asymptomatic in kids, and then you get lifelong immunity. The Hep A shot only protects you about ten years. So why are we giving it to kids? We should be HOPING they catch Hep A when they&#39;re little! <a href="https://imgur.com/snp60jn">https://imgur.com/snp60jn</a> The DTaP shot protects against symptoms but not transmission. You could be carrying pertussis in your throat, spreading it to kids, and not realizing it. Here&#39;s a doctor explaining it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNKcaWp3Sf4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNKcaWp3Sf4&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></li>
</ol>

<p>There&#39;s so much more I want to say, but this is just getting too long. I&#39;m open to any questions you have!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow this was an amazing read! Thank you. I was one of those parents who had to approve of % shots at a time. They prey on the fact you are a new parent and if you question them you are made to feel like you don&#39;t love your baby. It stopped at the HPV vaccine! I refused it for all 4 of my daughters. Boy you should have seen the looks I got. Thankfully my children survived all vaccines without any issues. Also I always thought the flu shot was detrimental. I only did it once with my family and we all got sicker than a dog! Never again!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there a possibility that there is a minimum level of health you have to be at for vaccines to be effective? I know that you arent allowed to take vaccines if you are currently sick(moderate-serious), but is it possible that those who experience adverse effects are just more prone to infections and the likes?  </p>

<p>I mean in the past, it was only the healthiest babies that lived to adulthood. Now we have babies that would&#39;ve died a couple decades ago living relatively healthy lives. Could it be those children that are more susceptible to the negative effects of vaccines?  </p>

<p>The reality is vaccines still benefit a majority of people, but there will always be a handful of people who experience adverse reactions. I think most likely, these vaccines are designed to eliminate the weaker genes from the population.</p>

<p>Unfortunately that&#39;s not what&#39;s happening. Pediatricians are so hell-bent on making sure shots are up to date, they&#39;ll give kids shots even when they&#39;re sick. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>but is it possible that those who experience adverse effects are just more prone to infections and the likes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dont think they&#39;re reacting to the antigens themselves, especially since the injections before 1 year are dead. I think they&#39;re reacting to the adjuvants and cellular medium that ends up in the final product. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>there will always be a handful of people who experience adverse reactions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is estimated that less than 5% of vaccine reactions are reported to VAERS. There are SO MANY adverse reactions that pediatricians write off as coincidence. So I wouldn&#39;t call it a handful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>why do you think antivaxxers are given so much exposure in the conspiracy community?  It&#39;s because they are wrong and it gives regular people something to look at and say &quot;hey look at these fucking idiots.&quot;  The same goes for flat earthers.  Vaccines are PROVEN to prevent the outbreak of disease.  You go to your doctor when you get sick so you trust your doctor enough to give you medicine but when he or she tells you to get vaccinated you think that it&#39;s not right?  Where is the logic in that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the epidemiological studies the media loves to hype don&#39;t mean much if anything at all.</p>

<p>They have studied only 1 vaccine but there are over 10 vaccines. The controls in this study are, guess what heavily vaccinated children.</p>

<p>So you have a study comparing people who smoking 20 cigarettes a day to people smoking 16 cigarettes a day and of course you won&#39;t find much difference between these two groups.</p>

<p>Also the studies are not randomized can there can be biases such as healthy user bias and other problems(check 3,4 and 16)</p>

<p>You can&#39;t say we haven&#39;t found a link when we never really tried hard to find a link.</p>

<p>The CDC found a link more than once but every time they changed the analysis to make it disappear. Obviously they weren&#39;t too motivated to find something quite the opposite.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t say vaccines don&#39;t cause autism and the science is settled. The science is rarely settled and certainly not if the only science that has been done so far is junk.</p>

<p>this is a false dilemma. you think autism is better than dead children that means even if vaccine caused autism it would be better than dying from smallpox.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make some solid points. I think the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Giving people all the shots in one go just seems lazy and irresponsible to me. Just common sense makes me me feel like the body needs time to acclimate/assimilate/ build resistances to any dead virus shot into you. Let alone 5 at once. </p>

<p>I suspect that vaccines still help more than they hurt. 1 million healthy kids is better than 500,000 dying of some ungodly plague that could have been prevented (cough cough, google the Spanish Flu). </p>

<p>The problem is, no one wants it to be their kid that gets sick from the vaccines, in order to save that million other people&#39;s kids. I mean it sucks, but I think thats the reality that parents conveniently ignore.</p>

<p>Look, you wanna be scared of something? Your kid is more likely to die in a car accident with you at the wheel than they are to get autism from a vaccine. </p>

<p>The fact is that there are millions of healthy people who have been vaccinated, including myself, who haven&#39;t gotten sick or developed cognitive disorders because of it. Much much more than those who have. </p>

<p>Not saying case closed, there should always be more research and better treatments invented. But lets be rational here. &quot;The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few&quot;. I suspect that&#39;s whats going through the heads of whoever might be involved in a potential cover-up.</p>

<p>Odds of dying in a car crash approx 1 in 583, whereas odd of autism 1 in 59, so autism is 10 times more likely than dying from a car crash.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 million healthy kids is better than 500,000 dying of some ungodly plague that could have been prevented</p>

<p>Let&#39;s use the example of measles, it brings a 1 in 10,000 risk of dying, whereas MMR vaccine has a one in 500 risk of leaving you disabled.  So that&#39;s 20 disabled kids for 1 life saved.  Not worth it at all, especially as the one who died of measles was already malnourished and/or on their deathbed, was waiting for a the last straw to break to camel&#39;s back.</p>

<p>As you&#39;ll see vaccines are clearly causing far more harm than any good.</p>

<p>If you don’t want your child immunised then don’t do it. At the same time don’t try to push ideals onto others who believe in vaccinations and the health of their children. </p>

<p>I agree with another comment where all babies have vaccinations and “suddenly” become autistic before they have the cognitive functions to give away the tells of autism. </p>

<p>Stop blaming the vaccinations and get on with your life. Your child needs you to get over yourself and give the love and attention they need. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1)anecdotal evidence is just about worthless. How many neighbours do you have? 10 - 20 people? Statistically there&#39;s nothing you could validate with such a small sample size.</p>

<p>3)Why would you care if you&#39;re not african american? </p>

<p>5)The current schedule has been tested for it&#39;s efficacy. But like all medicine, there are side-effects that could occur, sure. That said, the manufacturers shouldn&#39;t hide those side-effects when they show up, which would allow society to draw the balance: 1/10000 with autism versus 1/10 or so with polio, mumps, etc. Number out of my hat, but you understand a risk-benefit analysis, right?</p>

<p>6)I don&#39;t see the issue with this. Why not recycle medical waste? Even if you&#39;re religious, life would be designed to be able to get &#39;used&#39; this way, so why not make use of it?</p>

<p>8)This is the main point. They work and they prevent people from getting sick. The risk-reward profile of vaccination is heavily stacked in favor of vaccination because of the low cost of vaccines and the high cost of treatment if you actually do get the disease. The cost of eventual side-effects should be factored in, of course, but they&#39;re so rare that it would hardly matter.</p>

<p>10)My country doesn&#39;t vaccinate for chickenpox either. This is where the risk-reward or the cost-benefit (if you consider risk as a cost) analysis of the practice comes into play. The risks associated with chickenpox are, according to my government at least, too small to warrant vaccination.</p>

<p>12)Yes you can, but it&#39;s incredibly unlikely, and in the near future effectively impossible because they won&#39;t inject weakened pathogens anymore, merely unviable fragments of them.</p>

<p>14)Flu vaccination is also not encouraged unless you&#39;re a risk group, at least not in my country. Again it&#39;s a cost-benefits analysis and getting the flu is not lethal unless you&#39;re weakened or pregnant (in which case it&#39;s mostly a concern for the unborn child). Risk-groups are advised to get the vaccine, but it&#39;s never obliged. It&#39;s your risk to take but the option is there.</p>

<p>15)Science works because of it&#39;s process, where observations are linked to theories and the theories are then tested experimentally. There is no mechanism currently availabe that could explain a link between vaccines and autism. It doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t one, but it does mean that the burden of evidence lies with those that think there is one. If you have a theory, find a way to test it and get it published...</p>

<p>16)This is an issue of dosing. If a small dose causes something, a larger dose should cause it as well, but will cause it in more patients so you should see an increase in the experimental group versus the control group that actually correlates perfectly with the dose of vaccine employed. It&#39;s been clear that this isn&#39;t the case.</p>

<p>17)Again, it&#39;s a risk-reward profile. Apparently your government thinks the rewards of vaccinating for Hep B and Hep A far outweigh the costs and risks of it. I don&#39;t have the full evidence here, so I can only trust that they did it as it should be done. If not, ask the documents supporting the decision (FOIA laws should make sure you could get them) and examine the decision for yourself...</p>
