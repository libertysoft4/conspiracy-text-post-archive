    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t even remotely enough people dying for it to be a form of population control.
The staged shootings do go beyond the typical division and distraction though. They&#39;ve been rapidly converting the U.S. into a corporate police state. Part of that agenda is disarming the public while simultaneously arming the police and other goon squads to the teeth with military-grade gear.<br/>
If this were pretty much any other country, they would already have achieved this part of the agenda. This country has the 2nd amendment though, and much of the adult population understands the primary purpose of it (deterring government tyranny) so what they&#39;re having to do is brainwash a fresh generation to vote against the constitution; namely the smartphone generation; a generation that spends most of their time being entertained and knows very little about the way the world actually works (almost nothing besides what the controlled education system and controlled mainstream media tells them).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right everyone knows smallpox and other diseases killed of 90% of Native Americans, but those aren&#39;t weapons that were intentionally used. That all happened by accident. We were talking about weapons or at least readily available objects more deadly than guns. Do you have some deadly diseases laying around, some anthrax, some ebola, some plague rats? No. You don&#39;t. So that doesn&#39;t change my original point that guns are the most efficient and readily available weapon in our society if you want to kill a large amount of people as an average person. You have yet to name one thing other than fucking small pox to counter that position.</p>

<p>They&#39;re in the process of doing it. If things go according to plan, the smartphone generation will outvote you in banning guns (all guns eventually), and for people who don&#39;t comply, that&#39;s what the very profitable private prison system is for.<br/>
What happens then? Well, by now you probably know about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw">the list</a>.<br/>
The U.S. is on the longer version of that list, right after China and Russia. They are preemptively disarming the U.S.; one of the few remaining countries that poses a threat to the global government; a government run by them (a bunch of wealthy fascist psychopaths).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reductio ad absurdum.  </p>

<p>If true, that easy access to guns was a form of population control, what does it mean?  What assumptions must also be true for that to be anything but absurd.  </p>

<p>In actual government, when they want to reduce the population, the stop giving tax breaks for having kids.  They eliminate social programs that help families pay for childcare, education, healthcare, and food.  </p>

<p>The literal cheapest way to reduce the population is through comprehensive sex education that does not teach abstinence as the only form of safe sex, and by handing out condoms and birth control to young adults that are going to have sex whether they take sex ed classes or not.  Ironically, better education would probably reduce the need for a lot of govt. funding of social programs.  </p>

<p>The gun debate isn&#39;t about population control.  The gun debate is about selling more guns.  It&#39;s about propping up the MIC and carrying out the steps laid out in the Shock Doctrine.  </p>

<p>If the government were afraid of the guns that ordinary citizens are allowed to buy, they would not be legal.  Go ahead and get your Desert Eagle.  It might make a little dent in the surface of a tank the government will be using to quash an uprising if one actually occurred.  How many govt. agents died in Waco?    </p>

<p>If the govt. wanted severe and quick population reduction, they might release a biological agent.  </p>
