    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t watched his press conference, but this is my opinion on the Jones situation.  He&#39;s playing the part to help usher in a new era of censorship.  His recent rant at Nunez (I think, can&#39;t remember) is being used as the justification for twitter to ban him.  Twitter coming right out and saying because if his actions in the real world, they are removing him, even though he didn&#39;t break their tos.  Similar to reddit who now are removing users and claiming are trolls not based on the content, but how reddit perceives their intentions.  I tend to think Jones is similar to Hal Turner, who was also a radio host who was an FBI informant.  So it doesn&#39;t matter imo if Jones is 100% correct in what he says, he plays the part to make people turn off what he is saying because of his actions.  It&#39;s like a character assassination on anyone who is considered a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll check it out, thanks! But I&#39;ll say this though, it might be the angle I was pointing out with Joe Rogan.  With in back to back interviews Joe went from claiming Jones thoughts were dangerous and needed to be censored (Shooter Jennings interview) to claiming artist and writers should never be censored (chuck palahniuk interview).  I hope Jones went that route of saying he is a performer and is being targeted for his ideas, like he claimed in his divorce.  Here&#39;s a comment of mine with links to the Joe Rogan stuff.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9avq50/wow_joe_rogan_is_shilling_harder_than_ever_these/e4yko4b/?context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9avq50/wow_joe_rogan_is_shilling_harder_than_ever_these/e4yko4b/?context=3</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>For some reason I thought the press conferences was going to be more formal. The Alex Jones of 2007 would be mocking this version for feeding into the left right paradigm.  He doesn&#39;t seem to be addressing the larger issue, which he knows, is the Democrats and Republicans play off each other and is playing along.  Hence why I think he is controlled opposition.  He&#39;s not wrong about what he is saying, but failing to address both sides are working for the same elites.</p>
