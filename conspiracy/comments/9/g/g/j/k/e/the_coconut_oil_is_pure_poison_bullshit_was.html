        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Look, I actually was surprised at how fast this thing traveled. This was simply not a lecture you promote around the world. There is no way in hell an obscure lecture in fucking GERMAN makes the rounds to literally every single major media outlet without major backing from someone.</p>

<p>Mercola has a pretty good viewpoint on this sham: <a href="https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2018/09/10/coconut-oil-is-pure-poison.aspx">https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2018/09/10/coconut-oil-is-pure-poison.aspx</a></p>

<p>Look, I am not saying any one person is totally right, but we all know, objectively, that Harvard was caught in the 60s paying of experts to shill for the sugar industry. The AHA lobby is basically using 4 distinct and ridiculously outdated studies to shill the viewpoint that saturated fats are bad yadda yadda. These motherfuckers are the worst people on earth.</p>

<p>Not only has it been found that multiple indigenous cultures survived with little heart disease off mainly saturated fats, almost all of the new evidence points to unrefined virgin coconut oil as actually being a very positive thing for our health at least when used in moderation. You can view studies all over the internet. My favorites are usually those published by the National Center of Biotechnology information as they rarely have bullshit attached to them.</p>

<p>While this appears that Michels did this in her own right, shilling for her supporters and higher-ups, with ridiculously obtuse and decrepit research from decades ago, there is simply no way this blows up like it does without the fucking rancid vegetable oil industry sinking their teeth into this.</p>

<p>To induce my point logically, let&#39;s look at this:</p>

<p>How may stories in the last 5 years have you seen with Coconut oil in the headlines?</p>

<p>How many times have you seen a Harvard professor in the headlines of any kind of research related to health that blows up like this?</p>

<p>A few Harvard studies peak out now and then, but they rarely have anything so vitriolic to say. I can&#39;t name one study in the last five years that had so much attention surrounding it.</p>

<p>The claim is obviously hyperbole, and 95% or more of the people looking into this claim she is not right and there is a middle ground.</p>

<p>So not only do most people picking up this story not believe it, factually this Harvard shill is wrong.</p>

<p>I could go over the numerous uses for Coconut oil. No, I don&#39;t eat raw coconut oil out of the jar all that much. I use it for oral health for the most part. There are numerous articles and studies on NCBI that will provide loads of evidence for coconut oil and oral health. Also, there are hundreds of studies noting how efficient the oil is when it comes to bacteria and cleanliness, how it can help digestive systems, skin, wounds, et cetera.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s also just not a bad oil. While you probably need to use it in moderation, why call it a poison? Because it has saturated fats? We&#39;ve already been over the junk science that dominated the 60s and 70s and all the way up until now. Nobody believes that shit. Moderation is key, But coconut oil is fucking amazing when you use it cold-pressed and virgin. It has tons of uses.</p>

<p>Instead, we are told to eat rancid as fuck rapeseed oil variants like canola. While I do not mind canola now and then, I won&#39;t be fucking oil pulling with some shitty, rancid canola oil. Why? because Canola oil has hardly any uses outside of cooking. It&#39;s just not an oil you use for anything but frying, and even then it has its problems.</p>

<p>So the key idea here is most probably someone had a helping hand in trying to sell this absurdly ridiculous shit. I&#39;ve never in my life seen a Harvard speech, in German no less, get picked up by so many outlets.</p>

<p>Not only do you have to translate the motherfucker, people have to be interested enough to start sending it out to people.</p>

<p>That kind of shit just doesn&#39;t happen on this scale without outside help.</p>

<p>Another reason not to trust anybody at Harvard that is dealing with your health. Ever.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/13/493739074/50-years-ago-sugar-industry-quietly-paid-scientists-to-point-blame-at-fat">https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/13/493739074/50-years-ago-sugar-industry-quietly-paid-scientists-to-point-blame-at-fat</a></p>

<p>Don&#39;t ever forget that sugar is the villain in all of this. It will always be the villain. And who was caught shilling for this industry? Harvard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stopped using skin and hair products and switched to coconut oil a few months ago and I have never felt better. I&#39;m so tired of all these obvious attempts by the large corporate interests to try and discredit natural and ancient practices.</p>

<p>Also look into oregeno oil as a replacement for antibiotics or just to sooth just about any ailment.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have used organic oregano, clove, and most of all cinnamon for oral health for a while now. Cinnamon above all in dozens of studies with oral pathogens works better than antibiotics and basically anything else known that won&#39;t kill you.</p>

<p>It readily kills S. Mutans and other major caries producing bacteria in the mouth. I can attest to this as well.</p>

<p>It does burn a bit though, and out of those three oils it needs to be diluted the most. But yeah essential oils are amazing you are correct.</p>

<p>But it would definitely be called essential oil of Oregano. Oregano oil is something a bit different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You must dilute essential oils in a carrier oil like Coconut oil.</p>

<p>I recommend something like Nutiva Cold pressed Organic oil:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NTCE1M/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NTCE1M/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1</a></p>

<p>And then any number of organic essential oils. Plant Therapy on Amazon has a lot. Other brands also have some. There is a nice organic cinnamon brand: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GMTXFLE/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GMTXFLE/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1</a></p>

<p>It is expensive, and all nice essential oils are like 10 bucks or more, but they also generally last quite a while.</p>

<p>Eczema is from a lot of different sources, sometimes it is from health issues internally and people are naturally prone to it, which is actually good as the body is ridding itself of something.</p>

<p>That being said just coconut oil is good for eczema, but it&#39;s not necessarily going to cure it as the symptoms may be something else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eczema is from a lot of different sources, sometimes it is from health issues internally and people are naturally prone to it, which is actually good as the body is ridding itself of something, but also hard to cure in some ways.</p>

<p>That being said just coconut oil is good for eczema, but it&#39;s not necessarily going to cure it as the symptoms may be something else.</p>

<p>As for essential oils it just depends man. Cinnamon you would dilute quite a bit. It has intense cleaning ability, but that doesn&#39;t mean it will make eczema go away. That is more an internal thing as I have studied, but it can certainly not hurt.</p>

<p>You can look up essential oils and eczema on google and see if something might get your interest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always find it hilarious how Cinnamon oil is so powerful, and passes all the low tier studies, but we will never see anything of it because outside of that it probably is hard to patent, and people can use it as they will. But it beating shit like Chlorhexidine, a toxic wash that kills bacteria, is hilarious because it just shows you nature is where most of these drugs come from in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you use for your teeth? I tend to do coconut oil pulling a few times a week with light brushing every day with only a small amount of toothpaste (sometimes fluoridated, sometimes not). I don&#39;t live in a place where the water is fluoridated so I feel like I&#39;m not taking in too much of that. I wanna try brushing with charcoal/activated carbon but I&#39;m not sure if that would go well with oil pulling if it&#39;s particularly abrasive, if I should replace normal toothpaste for that entirely, just what sorta balance I should be looking at. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My 2 cents: </p>

<p>Biggest thing is to get your diet straight. If you avoid bread, pasta, candy/cake, soda -- things that stick to teeth -- and switch to mostly fruits and water, you really don&#39;t even need to brush your teeth.</p>

<p>BUT, my diet is not that perfect, so... </p>

<p>I use virgin sesame oil for oil pulling, every morning. Coconut oil turns solid at room temperature, and can clog pipes. (If you can spit it on the ground, then no worries.) You probably know not to gargle or swallow the oil, as the whole idea is to &quot;pull&quot; the excess bacteria and junk -- wouldn&#39;t want to eat that. I still brush my teeth, but just baking soda, if anything. I haven&#39;t used &quot;normal&quot; toothpaste in years. You can whiten your teeth with lemon juice for a couple minutes, and use dental floss soaked in lemon juice, but be sure to neutralize the acid afterwards by rinsing with baking soda.</p>

<p>One epiphany that may help is to realize that teeth can regenerate, just like bone, just like skin. We&#39;re conditioned to think that filling or extraction is the only answer to damaged teeth, and it&#39;s just not true. (Same wrt organs, btw.) I have many fillings that I now regret. Pretty sure that dentist was just making a buck at my expense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing! I don&#39;t eat white bread, only brown/wholegrain, which works great for me. I eat a lot of fruits and root veg, almost only exclusively drink water, but I do admit that I&#39;m a sucker for a chocolate biscuit bar. By no means am I eating a cake a day like some people, and I know my artificial sugar intake is relatively quite low, but I also know that it&#39;s still not great. But thanks! I&#39;ll try out baking soda and see how that works for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My only problem with sesame is that it is high in phytic acid, which is traditionally something in breads and grains and what not plus it does interfere with mineral absorption. I used to use sesame a lot, but I quit because coconut oil I think is superior in the mouth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly use a combo of Jason healthy mouth tea tree/cinnamon paste and Uncle Harry&#39;s paste, which is the best toothpaste I have found pretty much.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LY1YOAN/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LY1YOAN/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1</a></p>

<p>I brush very lightly with very little paste two or three times a day. Always washing food out no matter what time of day. I learned from a prior abscess that sugar eating bacteria are fucking quick whether you realize it or not. It&#39;s best to get them out as quickly as possible. Limiting sugar and phytic acid from grains and what not is also important in daily routines for overall health. Limiting sugar is absolutely necessary especially when you get older and weaker along with proper mineral balance and vitamin D.</p>

<p>I have to get a few of my gumline bottom level teeth filled with composite here coming up, so I need my teeth to be in perfect health. I currently have never had a root canal and do not plan to. I just have some minor bruxism, jaw clenching damage on bottom teeth outside of my smile so I never got it fixed. But I think a routine of brushing lightly a couple times and oil pulling with a drop or two of cinnamon oil is all that is needed. Try out Harry&#39;s toothpaste. I don&#39;t think you need any of the charcoal stuff. It&#39;s not going to do much. Cinnamon oil and other oils are tried and tested and will kill anything in your mouth better than charcoal will by miles.</p>

<p>But yeah outside of that I floss usually once every other day with tom&#39;s floss, which runs a little thicker so I tend not to use it every single day.</p>

<p>As for fluoride absolutely not in my toothpaste. Way too concentrated, and I do LONG oil pulls with a bit of fluoridated water mixed in at times so I get enough there. Every once in a long while I will use some normal toothpaste just because lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just use the minimum possible quantity of toothpaste (like half a pea) and sprinkle some cooking soda over the toothpaste. Brush slowly and gently for 2-3 minutes and remember to use the soda a few times per week. Also, try flossing (at least once a week) in the middle of brushing your teeth. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>While there&#39;s still soda and toothpaste foam in your mouth, floss then. It works wonders for keeping your teeth in shape in between dentist cleanups. Also stop drinking refreshments that rely on phosphoric acid, that shit is too strong for your teeth and bones. Lemon juice is making a comeback as a refreshment acidifier, try drinking those sodas instead</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Years ago in an agricultural feeds class I read that shortly after world war ii the US begin importing coconut oil to feed cattle to fatten them up.</p>

<p>It DID NOT work. The cattle slimmed down and had extra energy, they were running around rather than walking which is the opposite of what was wanted. It works the same with humans, slimming and energy.</p>

<p>The reason coco oil has a bad rep is the vegetable oils industry ran studies on various oils. They used hydrogenated coco oil in the studies which is just a bad as any other hydrogenated oil. It helped them promote terrible oils like corn and soy oils and kept the money at home rather than sharing it with coco oil farmers. </p>

<p>There are hundreds of studies from all over the world where people lost weight using coconut oil. Go to PubMed to read them and the hard science behind why coconut oil can cause weight loss - it&#39;s the medium chain fatty acid in the oil. </p>

<p>So, ya, it&#39;s the things you think you know that just ain&#39;t so that can be problematic. </p>

<p>As for living off coconut oil IDK no one does that, and in itself there is nothing to fear about coconut oil. It is high in saturated fatty acids, but so are many things. There is no clear correlation in anything but junk science from the 60s and 70s that links saturated fat directly to any major diseases when used even in above moderate amounts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been using coconut oil for the past year/year and a half as an means of keeping my teeth super healthy. There was a time, years ago when I didn&#39;t take such perfect care of my teeth and as a result, around two years back, I came up with some cavities to be filled. I fixed some of them, but one or two very shallow ones remained. Now, after about a year and a half of doing coconut oil pulling, even the teeth that my dentist wanted to fix back then have seemingly healed/remineralized, as I have just visited my dentist recently and he said there were no further cavities to fill.</p>

<p>If anyone is interested in my routine (I do this morning and evening + I usually swish some water with a solution made up with various herbs that dissolve acidity in my mouth after every meal or at least most meals):</p>

<p>-Floss my teeth</p>

<p>-I take one large tablespoon of coconut oil and swish it in my mouth 8-10minutes (brings bacteria to surface, kills bacteria, helps in remineralization)</p>

<p>-I mix a glass of water with a teaspoon of sea salt and swish it in my mouth for less than a minute (kills bacteria as well, removes any coconut taste, helps in remineralization)</p>

<p>-I brush my teeth for a few minutes with fluoride free toothpaste (Neem based), thoroughly (again kills any remaining bacteria and dislodges any food particles from my mouth that were present + gives me a fantastic fresh feeling in my mouth)</p>

<p>It might seem a bit excessive, but I really like having healthy teeth :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edited up the post for clarification and general tidiness. Coconut oil is often used in diets because it is a terrific source of calories and very efficiency energy source. Cutting sugar is the biggest thing, but you often need stuff to tide you over. Coconut oil is actually pretty damn good at doing this for me anyway. I don&#39;t eat it per se, but love to oil pull with it and some of it will obviously be ingested. </p>

<p>As for saturated fats there will be no decent counterpoint. Those horrible 60s and 70s studies are ridiculous, and anybody championing that shitty science is not a true scientist but a fucking shill.</p>

<p>There are cultures that have literally lived on mostly whales and whale fat without any major heart disease. Let that sink in. Big surprise though: they didn&#39;t eat sugar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been cooking with it for over 10 years, it&#39;s fine.  I used it this morning to fry eggs. Tastes weird at first but soon you get used to it. People use many oils to fry eggs and other foods, canola which is best reserved for industrial use, olive, avocado, bacon fat etc. Coconut is one of the healthiest you can use along with olive oil and grass fed butter and a few others. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to use it to make baked sweet potato fries, just a light coating on them and bake them. I use it in cookies and cakes etc, just at lower amounts than butter, or half and half of each - or replace some the butter with yogurt. Lotta different things you can do with it. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t put it on salad tho, it&#39;s solid at 72 degrees. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on taste. You might not like it as much. It has a different flavor, but yes it breaks down less than those oils. Not sure on smoking point. I don&#39;t use vegetable oil much for cooking unless blended with olive oil. No, I would not use much vegetable oil. Blend it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Years ago in an agricultural feeds class I read that shortly after world war ii the US begin importing coconut oil to feed cattle to fatten them up.</p>

<p>It DID NOT work. The cattle slimmed down and had extra energy, they were running around rather than walking which is the opposite of what was wanted. It works the same with humans, slimming and energy.</p>

<p>The reason coco oil has a bad rep is the vegetable oils industry ran studies on various oils. They used hydrogenated coco oil in the studies which is just a bad as any other hydrogenated oil. It helped them promote terrible oils like corn and soy oils and kept the money at home rather than sharing it with coco oil farmers. </p>

<p>There are hundreds of studies from all over the world where people lost weight using coconut oil. Go to PubMed to read them and the hard science behind why coconut oil can cause weight loss - it&#39;s the medium chain fatty acid in the oil. </p>

<p>So, ya, it&#39;s the things you think you know that just ain&#39;t so that can be problematic. </p>
