    <div class="md"><p>2.8 million Ashkenazi Jews live in Israel, they are the largest group making up 47.5% of the population. However, Ashkenazi Jews converted to Judaism 2,000 years ago and their origin is Poland, Russia, Hungry, Germany, and Lithuania. Their traditional language was Yiddish (Germanic Language with elements of Hebrew and Aramaic. SO, they are White Europeans, not the Hebrews from the bible who lived in the ancient Middle East in 1400 bc. </p>

<p>Just because you convert to a religion way after it&#39;s origins and then decide to start speaking Hebrew at the end of the 19th century into the 20th century. I don&#39;t you think you can then consider yourself a different ethnic group. </p>

<p>Would you classify a European American who converted to Islam as a different ethnic group from a European American Christian. I don&#39;t think so...Not trying to bash them, just pointing out the fact that Revelations 3:9 might be on the right track. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most Christians have no idea that what is practiced as &quot;Judaism&quot; by many people has <em>absolutely nothing</em> to do with traditional Judaism. Not only are they genetically distinct from the ancient Israelites, most reject important tenets of the Jewish religion. For centuries, these &quot;Jews&quot; have been usurious moneylenders, a practice forbidden in the Bible and condemned by Jesus in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleansing_of_the_Temple">only recorded example of his using violence</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;Jews&quot; are the <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/jews-least-observant-int-l-poll-finds-1.5287579">least religious people</a> according to a poll, which found only 56 even believe in life after death, and only 38% consider themselves religious, while 97 percent of Buddhists, 83 percent of Protestant Christians and 74 percent of Muslims consider themselves religious. Another <a href="https://www.simpletoremember.com/articles/a/jewsdontbelieve/">poll</a> found 52% of &quot;Jews&quot; don&#39;t believe in God.</p>

<p>&quot;Jews&quot; are far more likely than any other religious group to reject anything resembling traditional morality, which is why you see so many of them pushing degeneracy in Hollywood, the music industry, and porn. </p>

<p>This is not to be hateful toward anyone who comes from a &quot;Jewish&quot; heritage (although you probably aren&#39;t actually related to the ancient Israelites), or anyone who practices their religion. It&#39;s just to let people know that most of the people calling themselves Jews practice a religion that is totally at odds with Christianity, and in many cases, basic decency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Jews behavior&quot; you mean not being cowards and converting to Christianity when the sword was put against them by Roman Catholics? Aw wah sorry Jews successfully kept their cultural heritage while the rest of you destroyed all your temples and literature because the man in the big hat told you too. It&#39;s really no wonder that in these days many Europeans are trying to connect with their pre-christian roots, even since they found out it was a false religion used to cover up molesting children and committing mass genocide. Jews and Muslims have more claim to the heritage of Abraham than those of you who did as Rome demanded.</p>

<p>The European heads of state act far more out of Jewish interest than out of the interest of their own people and those who lobby hardest for multiculturalism in Europe and the West in general are Jewish, or funded by big daddy Soros.</p>

<p>Ben Shapiro is just a little sideshow neocon civic nationalist who is completely okay with white people being replaced as long as it&#39;s done legally but definitely doesn&#39;t advocate for anything similar for Israel. Just because he sodomizes a few college feminists with logic doesn&#39;t mean  much in the grand scheme of things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could see confusion here. Many Conservative Christian Americans believe that America and the world should revolve around them. Also many Americans across the political spectrum believe in America and America&#39;s place in the world as if it is a national religion. That America are unequivocally the good guys. That America must be the police, loanshark, bookmaker, judge, jury, and especially executioner of the world in order for the world to keep spinning. America has replaced Christianity as the national religion. Some people aren&#39;t so happy about everything America does overseas yet they believe that their quality of life is directly related to American crimes overseas. It may actually true as wealth is so top heavy that if bad things happened to banking or commodities companies, they might fuck the country up rather than take a quarterly loss. Americans don&#39;t share in the spoils of war, they are held hostage by policies. Europe too. They&#39;re too sunk in with NATO, Banks etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Old Testament was written by, and intended for, ancient Israel. God called the Jews his chosen people because the Messiah would come through Abraham&#39;s children, and because they were supposed to follow his laws and be a light to the world. After the Messiah came, there are no &quot;chosen people.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyone who wants to know God can do so, and all people are judges on the basis of their society&#39;s behavior, not their lineage. And ancient Jews were murdering Christians for the sole crime of believing Jesus was the Messiah, and continuing their degenerate behavior. Which is why God judged the Jews by letting the Romans slaughter them, destroy their temple, and scatter them to the ends of the earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agreed with your issue. I just don&#39;t see that happening. In all honesty, I think many racial identities require some clarification. For instance, on a job application, the definition of a non-hispanic white includes those in the middle-east and north africa. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The term &#39;white&#39; needs serious clarification about who should be included in this. For instance, jewish people will claim to be &#39;white&#39; when it suits them, and deny being &#39;white&#39;, but infact claiming to be jewish when it suits them. <a href="https://imgur.com/r/cringeanarchy/75Ydf">&#39;Fellow White People&#39;</a> on twitter is a clear example. But I believe one of the greatest strengths which has helped jewish people succeed is their ability to blend in as others when it is most beneficial for them, so why would they willingly clear this up? A strong moral fiber I would pray would be incentive enough to not deceive others purposely or by ommission. </p>

<p>Semite refers to people who live in the Middle East, so ironically Palestinians are actually Semites.  Ashkenazim are a Turkic/Mongol people who migrated to Eastern Europe from Central Asia centuries ago.  Ashkenazim have resided in Western European countries for a long time, so they also have some European blood mixed in.  They are not Semites.</p>

It is a colloquialism (meaning the word has been used culturally in a different way than its original definition) and has been defined as anti-Jewish for probably 100 years now. By trying to say that this word can’t be used to mean that anymore, you are attempting to silence those who are accusing antisemites (whether this is conscious or not)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me rephrase then: in America, the term “anti-semitism” has never in the past 100 years been used to describe “being against those who speak Semitic languages” and has nearly always been used to mean “anti-Jew”. Maybe you missed a day in history class but for the past 100 years there has been VERY high demand for a word meaning “anti-Jew”, so one was adopted and it stuck. This is how language works. We adopt it and change it. Yes I think it’s important to understand what it used to mean or what it could mean in different context, but it is <strong>actually harmful</strong> to try and make the claim that “anti-semetic” cannot be used to mean “anti-Jew” any more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are likely to confuse yourself by speaking in absolutes. And a disservice is done to the content of your argument when it consists of a fallacy.</p>

<p>Anti-semitism, historically speaking, has not been etymologically restricted to &quot;anti-jew.&quot; It is perfectly reasonable to be perplexed by its &quot;harmful&quot; meaning, but not to posit that its &quot;harmful&quot; meaning, in any form or fashion, silences those that aim to right injustices. It will not be a crime of thought to use a for a community of people to use a word however they choose to despite whatever extreme they reside on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Changed it to “rarely”, thank you. Absolutes are dangerous. </p>

<p>I just want to point out that if there was a need for there to be a specific word for, let’s say, “anti-German”, then there would have been such a word. However, we don’t have that word because there are not millions of people around the world who hold specific anti-German viewpoints. That’s not the case for “anti-Jewish”. The word “anti-semitism” has evolved from its previous meaning. Had there been any unspoken for minorities that were in need of a specific word to describe the hatred against them, I can assure you we would have found a word for that as well. However, no hatred of the Semitic people has been so strong and prevalent as that hatred against the Jews, and so the English speakers promptly and accurately chose a word to describe such a person. If you can name a group of people who have been silenced by being separated from the Semitic label I would love to read about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you -- it might be worth omitting your fallacy, too. </p>

<p>I believe I grasp your point, but it is erroneous.
There certainly are words for &quot;anti-german&quot; and &quot;anti-jew.&quot; (If one refers to historical literature that examines the US propaganda campaigns during WW2, this should be accessible.) One would be remiss to presume that there aren&#39;t human beings that hold germanophobic sentiment. An alarming amount of the human population is highly irrational and emotionally incompetent, some understandably so. The odds that Germany is excluded from irrational/rational ire, or any other nation for this matter, is inconceivably unlikely.</p>

<p>Those that object to the inappropriate use of antisemitism have turned to H. Adler&#39;s &quot;judaeophobia&quot; for quite some time now. Those that are anti-german have been considered germanophobes, i.e. relating to germanophobia. The antonyms of these terms come with a &quot;philia&quot; suffix, e.g. &quot;judaeophile&quot; or &quot;germanophile.&quot; Because one is ignorant of such terms does not mean that such terms do not exist, or that cultural contexts do not exist such that these terms are present in different languages. This is another fallacy.</p>

<p>I mean no disrespect when I say this, but your mind does not encapsulate the totality of human existence on Earth, nor should it. You&#39;re made human as humans are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel <a href="http://www.conspiracyschool.com/blog/israel-created-hamas-stall-peace">created Hamas</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to Charles Freeman, a veteran US diplomat and former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia, &quot;Israel started Hamas. It was a project of Shin Bet [Isreali domestic intelligence agency], which had a feeling that they could use it to hem in the PLO.&quot;</p>

<p>In 1965, Yassin had been arrested by Egyptian intelligence, but after 1967, when Israel took control of the West Bank and Gaza, Yassin was freed.  In 1973, under approval from Shin Bet, Yassin founded the Islamic Center, and began to establish effective control over hundreds of mosques.  In 1976, Yassin created the Islamic Association, which membership branches throughout the Gaza Srip, and the movement grew.</p>

<p>Israel&#39;s formal support for Islamic fundamentalism came with the election of the right-wing Likud party.  In 1978, Begin&#39;s new government formally licensed Yassin&#39;s Islamic Association, as part of a strategy to undermine the power of the PLO.  One aspect of that strategy was the creation of the Village Leagues, over which Yassin and the Brotherhood exercised much influence.  Up to 200 members of the Leagues were given paramilitary training in Israel, among whom Shin Bet recruited many paid informers.</p>

<p>David Shipler, a former reporter for the New York Times, cites the Israeli military governor of Gaza as boasting that Israel expressly financed the fundamentalists against the PLO...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it is. In 2012 the Oxford University press published the research by Dr Eran Elhaik who also co authored another research paper in 2016 with Paul Wexler both of which strongly support the Khazarian theory and it is worth noting this article on the Times of Israel website acknowledges this.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Israel seems finally to have thrown in the towel. A blue-ribbon team of scholars from leading research institutions and museums has just issued a secret report to the government, acknowledging that European Jews are in fact Khazars.

<p>&quot;We conclude that the genome of European Jews is a tapestry of ancient populations including Judaized Khazars, Greco–Roman Jews, Mesopotamian Jews, and Judeans and that their population structure was formed in the Caucasus and the banks of the Volga with roots stretching to Canaan and the banks of the Jordan&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes he said that.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Biblical and archeological records allude to active trade relationships between Proto-Judeans and Armenians in the late centuries BCE (Polak 1951; Finkelstein and Silberman 2002), *</em>that likely resulted in a small scale admixture between these populations and a Judean presence in the Caucasus.** After their conversion to Judaism, the population structure of the Judeo–Khazars was further reshaped by multiple migrations of Jews from the Byzantine Empire and Caliphate to the Khazarian Empire</p>

<p>Following the collapse of their empire and the Black Death (1347–1348) the Judeo–Khazars fled westward (Baron 1993), settling in the rising Polish Kingdom and Hungary (Polak 1951) and eventually spreading to Central and Western Europe. The Khazarian hypothesis posits that European Jews are comprised of Caucasus, European, and Middle Eastern ancestries</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes I wonder if the Holocaust was intentionally fomented in order to create this humanity oppressing mind job of antisemitism, not by beings that have empathy for Jewish people, but by beings that have a desire for the utility of the Jewish people. I suspect they are using the Jewish people as a proxy to implement global tyranny playing on the Jews using their well fleshed out, self-perceived, sense of superiority over humanity. This is useful so the Jews can be fooled into causing great harm and injustice to humanity without negative emotional outcomes for themselves, remorse or defection. </p>

<p>Empathy becomes disabled as one increasingly sees oneself as inherently better than the group or individual in question. Empathy requires that we see ourself in another&#39;s point of view. If we are inherently better, we don&#39;t do that as much or at all anymore. This superiority mindset is a facilitator to violence, especially for racists and soldiers.</p>

<p>Of course, as many of us know, the Holocaust was pivotal to getting the rest of humanity to stop criticizing the insidious and disproportionate pervasiveness and success of Jews in key positions of formulating what we think and do in civilization, finance, media, Hollywood, government, business, etc.</p>

<p>So, the Holocaust could plausibly have been fomented externally by a third party interested in using the manipulate (all egos are) egos of the Jews to manipulate them into manipulating us into a form of slavery that benefits the third party. It&#39;s lack of care for others generally is appalling to us, but it&#39;s pattern of evil behavior cascades down its hierarchies like a shadow, of corrupt, competition success causing information, that naturally appeals to its like minded servants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m seeing a lot of posts critical of the SPLC. </p>

<p>You know the SPLC takes their cues from the Anti Defimation League (ADL) right?</p>

<p>Clinton and her  Likud aligned donors cried to the ADL (which they control) and the SPLC followed because the ADL is the definitive voice in antisemitism. </p>

<p>The voices against the SPLC on this don&#39;t want to target ADL because then people will see that the money going to the ADL is the same as many of the large donors to Republican politicans, and they don&#39;t want that stain on them as they have their annual AIPAC bribe session review. </p>

<p>So it&#39;s easier to blame the SPLC because they are viewed as &quot;liberal&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s basic racism. You have most of it in a nutshell there. There are “Jew based” conspiracy theories about the cabal etc if you choose to search it out. Thing is if you go in with the Jewish angle you will find pretty poisonous shit. Better to go in via banking or just researching the most powerful families in the world. Leave the religion out of it. Whether religion binds these big families or not, racism doesn’t make anyone’s world view look big or clever. </p>

<p>Thats my take on it anyway. </p>

<p>Aside:
Many, people get anti-Zionism mixed up with anti-Semitism with anti-Zionism being opposition to the support of the state of Israel. This is how you end up with Labour MPs being labelled racist when in fact they are not, rather anti the terrible situation in Palestine, amoungst  other things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LMAO gee, idk, probably because Israel is an apartheid terrorist state filled with occultism and “prophecy”-believing lunatics who literally seek to control the world... mix that in with the fact that Jews control most of Hollywood, the media, the “news,” and even large portions of the US government, and I’d say that JEWISH SUPREMACY is a major problem.</p>

<p>Oh and Israel (with Saudi Arabia and the US government) did 9/11, soooooo...</p>

<p>But yeah keep it up with the ad hominem, strawman and non-sequiturs such as “u r anti-semetic” in order to deflect and distract and subvert from reality. I’m sure one day those tactics will work...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Open-minded &amp; earnest investigations of criminal acts and subversiveness that lead to discovering the guilty party, a guilty party which merely happens to be Jewish, is not anti-semitism.</p>

<p>But it’s that black and white and these “investigations” are not always or earnest or in good faith.... </p>

<p>Often the people who make it a personal mission to uncover corrupt or subversive individuals usually don’t start by finding a conspiracy or crime and then working their way to exposing a culprit. </p>

<p>Instead, they start with a high profile Jewish person or organization and then use convoluted and flawed investigatory means and very weak evidence of links to tie them to the conspiracy or crime. </p>

<p>When you start with a preconceived theory or notion (that Jews are responsible for X, Y, Z) and then go in search of only facts or links or evidence that fit an already preconceived presumption of guilt, while simultaneously ignoring any facts or links or evidence that doesn’t fit your theory, then you’re most likely an anti-semite. </p>

<p>Also, exposing crimes and subversiveness of individuals who happen to be Jewish may not be anti-semitism, but if you use the exposed criminal act(s) of the one Jewish person or group of Jewish individuals to paint all Jews as being evil or guilty whatever then that’s also anti-semitism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dr Elhaik&#39;s 2012 study does not support the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazar_hypothesis_of_Ashkenazi_ancestry">Khazar hypothesis</a> and, if the Times of Israel concluded thus, then they have either misunderstood the hypothesis or the study&#39;s findings. Here are Dr Elhaik&#39;s conclusions:</p>

<p>&quot;We conclude that the genome of European Jews is a tapestry of ancient populations including Judaized Khazars, Greco–Roman Jews, Mesopotamian Jews, and Judeans and that their population structure was formed in the Caucasus and the banks of the Volga with roots stretching to Canaan and the banks of the Jordan&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ooh.  Then why post at all?   I definitely think some Ashkenazi Jews are genetically from Judea and most Sephardic are but the genetics of most Ashkenazis are very diverse so it&#39;s hard to be definitive.  I just think it&#39;s an interesting theory and would explain the differing phenotypes.</p>
