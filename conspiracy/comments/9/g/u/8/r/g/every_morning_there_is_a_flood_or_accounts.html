Alex is pushing over-priced supplements and basically telling everyone he needs to sell them to keep his show going. It&#39;s all transparent. What MSM is doing is selling out to whoever, generally SSRI manufacturers and insurance companies that are all blasting us in the ass behind the scenes, lobbying to enslave us all with regulations like ACA. </p>

<p>Or how about when he himself testified during the custody hearing for his children? Highlights include stripping during counseling sessions, saying he smokes pot once a year to see how much stronger George Soros has made it, and he couldn’t remember details about his children’s school lives because he had just eaten a large bowl of chili. </p>

But in the last several years he has lost of credibility and doesn&#39;t seem to discuss actual conspiracies anymore.

<p>For some reason a good amount of conspiracy users don&#39;t get this.  The last thing I want to do when I get off work is continue to sit on my computer and read/comment here.  I wanna go outside, walk the dog, go fishing, or do anything else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m guilty of hating on Alex for being a shill as recently as just before the banning. But I think the fact that we all turned on him was good for those that want to restrict everyone&#39;s speech and ability to openly discuss non main stream things. Its obvious people have a tendency to use labels to define the world they see. But still labels can be misinterpreted and misapplied.
For example a shill is someone who will push 90% BS and 10% truth, Implying that the 90% BS eclipses the 10% truth and everything is discredited. Yet couldn&#39;t it also be true that the 90% BS Shielded or acted as a cover for the 10% truth?</p>
