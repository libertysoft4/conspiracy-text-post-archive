        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Comparison: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ykUEhYY">https://imgur.com/a/ykUEhYY</a> </p>

<p>The female figure looks suspiciously similar to TANIT, consort of BAAL — the setup (triangle-shaped dress, pose, halo) basically identical with her symbol.</p>

<p>Maybe a coincidence, but since Catholicism has a history of not having a problem with appropriating/recycling older „heathen“ stuff under the guise of „Christianity“, it shouldn‘t come as a surprise in case this similarity is intentional. Just sayin‘.</p>

<p>Here‘s an article that shows how TANIT relates to child sacrifice: <a href="http://www.arcalog.com/papers/the-tophet-child-sacrifice/">http://www.arcalog.com/papers/the-tophet-child-sacrifice/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>...sites were filled with thousands of pots filled with the charred remains of infants mixed with the bones. A stelae was erected above the burial, sometimes inscribed with a dedicatory inscription to Baal Hamon and / or Tanit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And another one about it: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jan/21/carthaginians-sacrificed-own-children-study">https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jan/21/carthaginians-sacrificed-own-children-study</a> 
There it says</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This is something dismissed as black propaganda because in modern times people just didn&#39;t want to believe it,&quot; said Josephine Quinn, a lecturer in ancient history at Oxford, who is behind the study, with international colleagues, of one of the most bitterly debated questions in classical archaeology.
&quot;But when you pull together all the evidence – archaeological, epigraphic and literary – it is overwhelming and, we believe, conclusive: they did kill their children, and on the evidence of the inscriptions, not just as an offering for future favours but fulfilling a promise that had already been made.
&quot;This was not a common event, and it must have been among an elite because cremation was very expensive, and so was the ritual of burial. It may even have been seen as a philanthropic act for the good of the whole community.&quot;</p>

<p>Gloria Vanderbilt also does interesting <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gloria+vanderbilt+dream+boxes+images">„art“</a></p>

<p>I originally tried to post this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9gbsp7/cnns_anderson_cooper_as_a_kid_with_his_mom_and_a/?st=JM5Q4U5S&amp;amp;sh=1b4d1ffd">here</a> but for some reason it wouldn‘t publish my comment, although I don’t see how it would be against the rules.

    <div class="md"><p>The way I interpret that phrase is that any word we write or speak can be a name for God, words are like his footprint. Pulling a thought out of your mind, making a sound with your voice to conjure that thought and give it a meaning, and ultimately having someone on the receiving end understand it. Is that not magic? Godlike? That is God in the living flesh. It&#39;s all metaphorical of course, but just IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He had nothing to do with Satanism. The religion he founded was Thelema. A hodge-podge of science, alchemy and a plethora of hand picked religious beliefs from the east and west.  Egyptian mythology played a big part. He created his own type of Magick from blending esoteric knowledge from across the board. </p>

<p>I&#39;m by no means very knowledgeable about him. I&#39;ve been reading &quot;Portable Darkness: An Aleister Crowley Reader&quot;, basically a condensed compendium of his different subject matter throughout his books. The first chapter has to deal with what you described. But as far as I know, it WASN&#39;T metaphorical. It is the foundation and basis of Magick.</p>
