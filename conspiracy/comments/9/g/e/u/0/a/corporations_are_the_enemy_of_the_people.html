<p>Sounds like a problem with the government, not the corporation. Most people wouldn&#39;t pay their taxes if they weren&#39;t being forced, so why would corporations who aren&#39;t forced.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Why do the workers accept such low wages if they are worth so much more according to people like you?</p>

<p>If welfare didn&#39;t exist, people wouldn&#39;t be able to take jobs for shit pay and jobs would have to pay more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Why do the workers accept such low wages if they are worth so much more according to people like you?&quot;
In the UK you can&#39;t turn down a job because it&#39;s low pay or your benifits will be stopped. So people are forced into low paying jobs, it&#39;s not a choice. It&#39;s a vicious circle, that could be broken if these billion dollar company&#39;s payed a living wage to it&#39;s staff. The situation would also be helped if these companies payed there fare share of tax.
What about the people who had a decent job that could afford to keep 5 kids, then they lose there job? Should the state not help them? </p>

<p>Charities are much more efficient than governments are and if they don&#39;t spend your money wisely, you can fire them. You cannot fire the government.</p>

<p>People have also stopped helping each other. Back in the day, when people died or lost their jobs, the whole neighborhood would help. People would take donations, watch the kids, help them get jobs and such. Appalachian areas and Amish sections still do this.</p>

<p>People do not trust people of other races/ethnicities - <a href="https://imgur.com/a/MutsIL3">https://imgur.com/a/MutsIL3</a>.</p>

<p>The Amish are a high trust society. They have to be. They help each other whether they want to or not when others need it because they know that down the line, they will need the help as well. I heard a story yesterday from someone in the Appalachian area. They needed medical help and didn&#39;t have the money. The doctor helped them and the next day, the doctor had a fresh homemade apple pie on their doorstop and their car washed. </p>

<p>The governments can shut down and stop any corporation they want tomorrow if they don&#39;t stop certain activities. The corporation cannot do the same.</p>

<p>If we solved everyone&#39;s problems, they would riot in the streets within a year and invent new problems. People need balance. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>They could. Governments can do anything they want. Think of all the corrupt  crimes they have done without consequence. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>We give the government billions in taxes each year and apparently, that&#39;s not enough.</p>

<p>The government should have let them fail. Hundreds of businesses probably close everyday without the option of bailouts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very general. Most corporations are small businesses. I own a corporation, and I&#39;m its only employee. People are lucky to have jobs. Especially after the depression we just went through. What you get paid is always according to your level of education and expertise at the job. If you&#39;re not getting paid enough to box goods at Amazon, then try to get another job boxing stuff at another company. Most likely, you&#39;ll get paid the same because of the level of importance of your job, and how many people are willing to aplly for it.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t escape economic and market principles. If you owned your own one man business, and decided to hire a worker, you&#39;d pay him what you felt you could. If it wasn&#39;t high enough for the position, and people weren&#39;t applying, then you&#39;d have to raise the pay rate to attract someone.</p>

<p>Supply and demand always comes into play.</p>
