        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-09-17 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/EarthAngelEarthAngel.html">EarthAngelEarthAngel</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the 1990s <a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Gary_Caradori">Gary Caradori</a> was hired to investigate the claims of the child trafficking rings which were being run by the C.I.A.</p>

<p>He was former Law Enforcement and a trained investigator and interviewer with sufficient credibility to be employed by the Nebraska legislature.</p>

<p>He was hired to investigate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_child_prostitution_ring_allegations">child trafficking allegations</a> which stemmed in Omaha, Nebraska however were also active in Washington D.C. as well as Texas and many other states.</p>

<p>These child trafficking rings had many elements to them, these included:</p>

<p>- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">MK - UTRA</a>, This is the C.I.A. mind control program which was adopted from the Nazi regime after &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip">Operation Paperclip</a>&quot;.</p>

<p>Operation Paperclip was a secret program of the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency in which more than 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians were recruited in post-Nazi Germany and taken to the U.S. for government employment, primarily between 1945 and 1959; many were former members and some were former leaders of the Nazi Party.</p>

<p>Due to Nazi mind control efforts the U.S. began to research its use, this started the project MK-ULTRA.</p>

<p>MK-ULTRA had created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_O%27Brien_(conspiracy_theorist">Monarch Programming</a>), this was a subsection of Project MK-ULTRA and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_ARTICHOKE">Project ARTICHOKE</a>,Monarch Programming implemented satanic ritual abuse for the use of mind control.</p>

<p>Trauma based mind control creates dissociative identity disorder which allows the programmer to literally program in personalities separated by amnesic barriers formed by the traumatic event whether it be satanic ritual abuse, sexual abuse, both etc.</p>

<p>As the mind cannot withstand the trauma it causes mind dissassociation and builds amnesic barries around the traumatic event. The handlers are then in direct contact with the sub consious, from here they can program in multiple personalities seperated by amnesic barriers to carry out specific tasks.</p>

<p>There are many types of personalities a handler will then create, these can include: Alpha, Delta, Beta, Omega + many more.</p>

<p>- ALPHA. is regarded as general or regular programming these are known as front alters, they are used to disguise the mind control subject in public. These alters are characterised by extremely pronounced memory retention, along with substantially increased physical strength and visual acuity. Alpha programming is accomplished through deliberately subdividing the victims personality which, in essence, causes a left brain-right brain division, allowing for a programmed union of L and R through neuron pathway stimulation.</p>

<p>- BETA. is sexual programming. This programming eliminates all learned moral convictions and stimulates the primitive sexual instinct, devoid of inhibitions.</p>

<p>- DELTA. This programming is used to train killers, originally developed for training special agents or elite soldiers. Subjects are devoid of fear; very systematic in carrying out their assignment. Self-destruct or suicide instructions are layered in at this level. Here a mode known as &quot;Range Mode&quot; is programmed into the subject, this makes the subject feel as if they are at a shooting range taking aim at their target.</p>

<p>- OMEGA. is self-destruct programming, also known as &quot;Code Green.&quot; The corresponding behaviours include suicidal tendencies and/or self-mutilation. This program is generally activated when the victim/survivor begins therapy or interrogation and too much memory is being recovered.</p>

<p>These programs will then recieve names which will create the personality, the victim can have thousands of personalities programmed in them.</p>

<p>Once programmed in, the handler will use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEqVgJynZRg&amp;amp;t=18m24s">trigger words</a> and hand signs to switch personalities within the victim.</p>

<p>The mind controlled slaves are used for many tasks, these include:</p>

<p>- Drug trafficking</p>

<p>- Blackmail underage pornography blackmail</p>

<p>- Sex slave</p>

<p>- Satanic Ritual Abuse</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The handlers who create the personalities mainly carried out the programming at air force bases around the united states. For this case it was occurring at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offutt_Air_Force_Base">Offutt Air Force Base</a></p>

<p>One way to create a new personality is to sacrifice a child then cast the childs spirit through spells into a subject, this is meerly a use of enchantment also known as hypnotism.</p>

<p>The event is so traumatic the subject will believe the sacrificed child has been cast into them and therefore will create a new personality based on the sacrifice and programming.</p>

<p>This is a method by Monarch Programming which implements satanic ritual abuse.</p>

<p>Once victim by the name of <a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Paul_Bonacci">Paul Bonnaci</a> underwent this enchantment at the age of 3, he was taken in by Monarch Programming shortly after birth in the 1970s.</p>

<p>At the age of 10 Paul Bonacci began to be used as a decoy to lure children off the streets into these rings controlled by Monarch.</p>

<p>He admitted to helping in the kidnapping of a boy by the name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Gosch">Johnny Gosch</a> that went missing in West Des Moines, Iowa on September 5th, 1982 at the age of 12. Johnny Gosch was used in the underage sex mind control rings.</p>

<p>Not only were these children used at sex and murder parties for blackmail but also as drug traffickers for the C.I.A.&#39;s drug trafficking operation. They were also used as messangers.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Drug Trafficking:</p>

<p>The C.I.A under the Bush/Reagan administration were involved in trafficking cocaine and heroin, this became known as the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair">Iran-Contra Scandal</a>&quot;.</p>

<p>The C.I.A began to work with the medellin cartel and cartels of south america to ship cocaine into the U.S., they used the drug profits to arm and fund the contras in Nicaragua.</p>

<p>The contras were an anti communist rebel group. The C.I.A. also secretly facilitated the sale of arms to Iran incuding missiles.</p>

<p>They used this money to fund the contras who in return would help with the cocaine smuggling.</p>

<p>The children from Monarch Programming were used to help with the trafficking of drugs as during stops at airports the children would act up going as far as wetting their pants to form a distraction.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Satanic Ritual Abuse:</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The satanic ritual abuse involves many aspects, as explained early it is used to hypnotised for Monarch Programming.</p>

<p>The handlers/programmers use occult practises using methods from the Egyptian book of the dead to inflict trauma,The Egyptian Book of the Dead, describes using a compilation of rituals explicitly describing methods of torture and intimidation (to create trauma), the use of potions (drugs) and the casting of spells (hypnotism), ultimately resulting in the total enslavement of the initiate.</p>

<p>An Australian MK-ULTRA victim  by the name of Fiona Barnett had an Egyptian book of the dead method carried out on her, she was buried alive with a corpse and ran out of oxygen so was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVuu5AbII4&amp;amp;t=18m57s">resurrected</a>. This was called a rebirth ceremony.</p>

<p>The satanic ritual abuse uses the reversal of the catholic mass these rituals are blood occult rituals which are horrific, abuse survivors have described witnessing children being flailed, skinned alive/pinned back and crucified <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvEBmEo4IA0&amp;amp;t=56m42s">reversal of the catholic mass</a> these rituals are blood occult rituals which are horrific, abuse survivors have described <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLVuu5AbII4&amp;amp;t=65m50s">witnessing children being flailed, skinned alive/pinned back and crucified.</a></p>

<p>The satanic ritual abuse is used for mind control purposes but goes further into mystical covens which practise occult methods for magical, &amp; mind control purposes.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Blackmail Tapes:</p>

<p>Russell E. &quot;Rusty&quot; Nelson was allegedly employed by a former Republican Party activist to take pictures of current or retired U.S. House-Senate members and other prominent government officials engaging in sexual criminality by receiving or committing sodomy and other sex acts on children during the Reagan-Bush administration.</p>

<p>Rusty has evidence, including photographs, that implicates prominent law enforcement and political figures, including two past U.S. presidents, in crimes of child abuse, pornography, kidnapping, drug smuggling, money laundering, illegal campaign financing, and illegal activities by the FBI and CIA.</p>

<p>Rusty also allegedly abused the children involved.</p>

<p>Lawrence King, known as Larry King was once the leader of the National Black Republican Council. During the 1980s he was one of the fastest rising members of the republican party. Larry King was the general manager of the Franklin federal credit union, a bank in Omaha, Nebraska. In 1979 Larry king developed close commercial ties with BoysTown. Boys Town was a catholic institution used to home orphaned youth, it was located in boys town Nebraska. Boys Town had several accounts with the Franklin federal credit union, In return young boys would start to work for companies owned by Larry King. Larry King then began to allegedly take advantage of the boys by including them in a sick scheme.</p>

<p>Larry King would throw parties in mansions and hotel rooms, he would invite prominent politicians of the time. Near towards the end of the parties whoever was still there, Larry would offer a service. He would make the boys perform sexual acts on politicians who were into underage boys, the boys were referred to as &quot;toys&quot;. These acts were filmed and kept as blackmail tapes giving leverage to king and his agenda.</p>

<p>In 1984, children of boys town started making allegations against King however they were not followed, the F.B.I. made victims recant their testimonies.</p>

<p>In 1985 Paul Bonnaci was involved in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEqVgJynZRg&amp;amp;t=23m9s">snuff film</a> filmed at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Grove">Bohemian Grove</a>, the victim was a boy named Jeremy who was kidnapped in Idaho.</p>

<p>After the snuff film, Paul along with another survivor were taken to a house where people involved in the snuff film and others watched the film while paul and the other survivor were sexually abused while watching the tape.</p>

<p>In 1987, congress began investigating the C.I.A Monarch Programming and told them to discontinue the program. Former F.B.I chief  Ted Gunderson claims the program is still in use.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Gunderson">Ted Gunderson</a> had begun investigating these rings and he had discovered one was operating in washington D.C. under the name of &quot;The Finders&quot;, they were also involved in kidnapping children then using them in sex and murder parties for blackmail.</p>

<p>In 1988, the I.R.S issued the F.B.I to raid the franklin federal credit union, Larry King was arressted for stealing 40 million dollars from the bank.</p>

<p>Shortly after Franklin’s offices were raided, information about other activities, besides the fraud that was taking place, began cropping up. Activities such as kidnapping, child abuse, child sexual abuse, drug use, drug dealing, drug trafficking, prostitution, the selling of children and Satanic rituals involving animal and human sacrifice.</p>

<p>the allegations increased to a staggering number so authorities began to investigate, nothing came out of the investigation as it was found many key people in the white house were invovled with the child trafficking ring.</p>

<p>In 1989 the scandal almost broke worldwide after the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1989/08/01/the-bombshell-that-didnt-explode/ff09cdb0-7d64-428b-8415-a6998b9f0c65/?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.0280515639f9">washington times reported a gay prostitution ring</a> being run inside The White House, this was used for people who were homosexual and were not into underage sex. The homosexual activities were filmed and used for black mail, the story was quickly covered up as it would have lead to the underage findings.</p>

<p>In the 1990s, Gary Caradori started his investigation.</p>

<p>He had obtained some of the blackmail tapes including child abuse and murder with high ranking politicians such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEqVgJynZRg&amp;amp;t=27m56s">George Bush Senior</a> allegedly being featured in them.</p>

<p>He obtained these tapes on the 10th of July 1990, the day after on July 11th 1990 Gary along with his 6 year old (other sources say 8, 11) son Andrew &quot;AJ&quot; were assassinated after a plane they were travelling on <a href="https://hotk.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/00.jpg?w=154&amp;amp;h=300">blew up</a> mid flight.</p>

<p>The suitcase he was travelling with which contained the evidence was never recovered, Ted Gunderson made an inquiry to find the back seat but this was never recovered either.</p>

<p>Although Gary Caradori was a civilian the plane was taken to an air force base, his wife was also murdered just months later.</p>

<p>The allegations were covered up by the Omaha World-Heral newspaper claiming the allegations of child sex trafficking were a hoax, however it was found the publisher Harold W. Andersen was believed to be involved in the rings.</p>

<p>The victims to these child sex rings claims it was happening worldwide and many were taken overseas many times to attend rituals and parties.</p>

<p>Some believe these rings continue to operate today, this scandal has since become known as &quot;The Franklin Cover-Up&quot;.</p>

<p>A full documentary about these rings with all different witness testimony and a currently running blackmail ring can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEqVgJynZRg">here.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, but if they REALLY want you there are literally hundreds of ways for them to do it, so if they want you fucked, you&#39;re gonna be fucked either way. Multiple gunshot &quot;suicides&quot; or hangings, drowning &quot;accidents&quot;, &quot;botched&quot; robbery/murders, or just flat out mysterious disappearance without a trace. But you&#39;re right, flying in a small prop plane just makes it a lot easier and probably cheaper. </p>

<p>Site-wide. We have a few websites that are blacklisted (mostly blogspam, and CNN of course) but the site itself has much more. We usually just manually approve it, so they may have happened in the past. When it comes across <em>my desk</em> I like to notify you that I did it (because it starts conversations like this) for transparency&#39;s sake.</p>

<p>This one actually seems plausible. The NTSB report is pretty sparse. </p>

<p>However, the plane did not “blow up.”  A number of things, nefarious or not, can cause an in-flight breakup. I think it detracts from the credibility of the rest of the evidence by using the term. </p>
