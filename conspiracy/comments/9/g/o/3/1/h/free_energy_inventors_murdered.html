        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Very interesting. This man Stan Meyer made a car that ran on nothing but water. It could travel the entire USA with only 24 gallons of water, and the water could be any type. Salt water, tap water, lake water etc. He was offered 2 billion dollars by oil embargos to have the rights to his car and he refused. He was poisoned in a restaurant after having a meeting with someone in the oil business. His blueprints exist on a website which is shut down constantly, and the owner of it has not been online for over 3 years since. It&#39;s very interesting. The car was proven to work and was investigated, and was proven to work on nothing but water. The most important thing was, is that before he was killed, Stan stated that he was able to make any car engine or machine engine run off of water. It&#39;s very strange that he was killed, and before so was offered billions for him to stop making what he was making, a real conspiracy. </p>

<p>This man was also able to make an electric car that did not have to run off of batteries, but rather magnetism, after his car was proven to work, he was killed. <a href="https://youtu.be/vFfsEfnsA4I">https://youtu.be/vFfsEfnsA4I</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this thing was real, it still runs on deuterated water, not just normal tap water. I&#39;m not very technical minded, but seems like his blueprints show some kind of converter to turn that water into deuterium water. I know the normal process is through distillation or electrolysis, both of which need a power supply. So the question is how can he do this with out any kind of power source? That seems to be an obvious and easy question to answer, yet nothing mentioned on his website. </p>

<p>The whole thing seems a bit suspect. They went through the effort of supposedly giving us the blueprints for his car, but no layman explanation for how it would actuslly work?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I looked into it, his conversion process (I think) used high voltage with almost no current. And it I guess just vibrated the water at specific frequencies to split it into hydrogen and oxygen.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the title you posted is going to confuse people, since this isn&#39;t technically &quot;free energy&quot;, as it is water based.</p>

<p>However besides that, it&#39;s a very unfortunate event and I would suspect there is plenty of truth within it. The stranglehold these giant fossil fuel energy companies have on our economy is still vast. It seems that solar and wind are gaining steam, but even there the whole thing is gaining only as much momentum as profit can be extracted from it.</p>

<p>I&#39;d hazard a guess that there have been many inventors that had brilliant ideas to harness the energy from  various parts of our planet and atmosphere, yet they have been silenced or killed. </p>

<p>Tesla already is a good example of this. I recommend everyone looking into his life story, his grand discoveries and promises of &quot;free electricity&quot; for all, which JP Morgan at the time did not desire to fund. &quot;Coincidentally&quot; later on Tesla&#39;s lab and all his research burned to the ground, as he lived out the rest of his life in poverty and obscurity, dying alone in New York, never able to realize his scientific genius to its full potential (despite the fact that he already gave us the building blocks for the functioning of modern society through his inventions - still I have no doubt there was plenty more up his sleeve).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The energy source Stan Meyer was using taps into this quantum vacuum. I don’t think he designed his engine to work directly that way, but he created an over unit system where he got more energy output than the energy input into the system to start it. His “excess” energy output could be attributed to pulling energy from the quantum vacuum. His electrolysis engine works hand in hand with this concept of physics. Even our normal combustion engines for cars tap into this quantum vacuum but extremely inefficiently. The link I provided above discusses this briefly from Lt. Col. Thomas Bearden of the US Army. </p>

Without resonance you would just be using plain old electrolysis which requires a catalyst. If you study carefully you will see Stan Meyers discovery required no catalyst in order to create the effect</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely right that the widely accepted information on Planck’s Constant indicates you can’t generate a deviation of the normal path of a subatomic particle that gives you enough energy to extract. However, many physicists have contended with that assertion and I will provide some published articles below in the subject. I don’t want to get too technical trying to type equations here, but I would argue that you don’t violate any known laws of the universe by extracting energy from a quantum vacuum. It may be frowned upon to reference another reading to explain my point, but this short article linked first below does a good job summarizing the hypothetical scenario of extracting this vacuum energy. </p>

<p>Nobody is arguing this, this is widely accepted scientific fact. In fact, nuclear fusion in the sun taps into the vacuum energy as part of its process. What you can&#39;t do is extract <em>work</em>, which is different from energy, and the kind of stuff that you&#39;d need to power a car for example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many physicists and chemists have argued this. Nikola Tesla argued this. This is not simply my opinion because I don’t have a great enough understanding of it. My expertise is geotechnical engineering but many professional papers have been published over the past 100 years on this topic. It is subjected to disinformation and not widely accepted because it challenges many accepted truths in physics that we use every day in design of everything from circuits to building foundations. Work is energy. The change in kinetic energy of a system is equal to the net work done on the system. </p>

<p>In the link below, if you watch from 16:00 to 22:00, you will see a direct replication of one of Tesla’s experiments where he draws energy from this quantum vacuum and generates a flow of electricity that is vastly different from what the common person is exposed to daily in design or construction. If you touch a live or hot wire that is exposed in water, you will receive an electrical shock. In the replicated experiment, one can touch a live wire in water and receive no such shock. The entire video linked below is very long but the part I want to emphasize is from 16:00 to about 22:00. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you understand what I&#39;m saying. The fact that you can pull energy from the vacuum is accepted and mainstream science nowadays. When you fuse protons together, one of them has to turn into a neutron by flipping one of its three quarks from up to down, which emits a W- boson. This W- boson is much heavier than the quark that emitted it. Where does the mass come from? It comes from the vacuum and is borrowed by a short time before it has to decay into an electron neutrino and a positron. </p>

<p>The other way to extract vacuum energy is via a black hole, although that causes the black hole to evaporate and I don&#39;t think you can fit one inside a car.</p>

<p>Also, I do not understand what does that circuit in the video has to do with vacuum energy. The electricity is coming from an electrical outlet. It doesn&#39;t shock you because it uses high frequency current which has something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect">skin effect</a> . Tesla was obviously a genius for discovering things like this but he was no quantum physicist, he didn&#39;t even believe in particles...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pulling energy from a vacuum and harnessing it is not mainstream science. That does not mean it cannot be done or it has not been done. The replication of Tesla’s experiment in the video shows that the current is not normal AC or DC. If you choose to draw your energy from the outlet through a copper wire to a lightbulb and keep your wire exposed, it will shock you in water if you touch it. For example, unfortunately, people get electrocuted far too often on construction sites around the US every year due to power cords being exposed and laying in a small puddle of water. The experiment shows that the energy flow in the wire that the guy holds in the water is not what you normally observe in AC or DC circuits because it is not a normal current flow. I don’t see how this Tesla experiment is an observation of the skin effect. The skin effect simply states the largest concentration of current flow moves to the surface of a conductor when increasing your AC frequency. The conductor in the experiment is the live wire the guy is holding in his bare hands. Could you elaborate on how the experiment in the video displays the skin effect?</p>

<p>But before then, i bet there will be a scarcity problem where anything that uses fossil fuels becomes expensive, given the area hasn&#39;t already converted to solar, wind, or electric energy.</p>

<p>Very interesting...part of me doesn&#39;t even want to contribute to the problem by buying a car, then again, a car is damn near necessary in many areas.

    <div class="md"><p>Yell free energy and the shills come running.
Stanley Meyer found a way to cavitate the water allowing for the splitting of h2o into its constituent elements at energy levels far less than conventional electrolysis. The result was hydrogen production that had an energy potential much higher than the amount used to split the water molecules. The secret to everything is in vibration and frequency. The frequency at which he is pulsing electricity through the water is a key ingredient. Here&#39;s a presentation about it: <a href="https://youtu.be/pa2sjMN8sMc">https://youtu.be/pa2sjMN8sMc</a>. As for all the shills screaming 2nd law or just straight up insulting this thread you can all eat shit.

    <div class="md"><p>Nikola Tesla supposedly had plans for wirelessly transmitted energy, that you could tap into anywhere in the world, using the earth&#39;s electromagnetic fields as a conduit. If I am incorrect please correct me, hastily writing so I didn&#39;t pull up a source beforehand, just offhand. Either way, soon after beginning construction on the first tower in New York, his apartment was raided by the government.</p>

<p>To be fair he did have blueprints for a death ray that could blow up the moon, but his understanding of electricity and energy was far superior to his peers, even by today&#39;s standards. If I remember correctly, he supposedly had a successful wireless energy transmission between two of his labs in Colorado, with energy loss less than that of copper cabling, standard at the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was aware of Steven E. Jones sabotage of Fleischmann–Pons work but did not know he had managed to ingrain himself into the 9/11 movement.
I think if you can get past the Mormon connection his old Uni, Brigham Young University seems to do a myriad of experiments.
I have come across more articles on alternate websites promoting some wacky invention or other over the last 10 years, from BYU than anywhere else.
A part of me always figured theres a grain of truth, now I know for sure.
You play a part in keeping the status quo by helping suppress that which would benefit humanity and tptb will throw a few nuggets as thanks.
A shame as BYU is considered a joke tier academic estaishment, so are never taken seriously.</p>
