I&#39;m somewhat on the fence myself about a lot of different things.. but how would you answer the questions of: how would every NASA employee ever, lie and keep it up over generations... how would Russia/ other countries not call out the moon landings as fake.. are they conspiring together? You can argue that NASA lies but how do they get every single employee to lie/ keep them in the dark entirely, especially when they&#39;re all experts in their fields?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess that kind of feeds into my original question though like, why is there a need to photo shop?  Assuming you meant they photo shop things but not just to touch them up, more so to hide/ create things..  How has it managed to stay quiet or not called out?  Fear of being labeled crazy?  However I would like to kind of find the argument of IF they moon landings were fake, how would it not be exposed bc I still think that is a major flaw to the fake moon landing argument.</p>

<p>why is there a need to photo shop?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most cameras in space are not like your iphone. They take different wavelenghs, often needing to stich many photos to creat the panoramics you see. For instance the Titan Hguyens probe. The real images are thousands in bands that don&#39;t cover 100% of the image, plus barely any contrast. The image NASA shows you has been photoshoped to fill in the wholes and stitch together images that are taken at different angles. This means the individual images are distorted to fit together.</p>

<p>This is what NASA and the media post to show you Titan: <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/ten-years-ago-huygens-probe-lands-on-surface-of-titan">https://www.nasa.gov/content/ten-years-ago-huygens-probe-lands-on-surface-of-titan</a></p>

<p>These are some of Hguyens pictures <a href="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/F901221D-82FC-4736-BA00A116375EE71E.gif">https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/F901221D-82FC-4736-BA00A116375EE71E.gif</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of your or my opinion on the moon landing, the government has had no problem keeping massive projects secret from even the employees working on said projects.</p>

<p>Look into Oak Ridge and The Manhattan Project. Most of the 75,000 employees had no idea they were building a nuclear bomb.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no doubt that the video of the moon landing was fake.  Do you really think they would do a livecast of such a dangerous mission, and then show the world what they were doing? No, they would fake it, fake audio, and run military operations in private.  What if something terrible had happened?  Do you think they would want it televised?  The mission was made to be a success.  By any means necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>playing devils advocate... does everyone in the army have access to top secret data. </p>

<p>The engineers build rockets and such  believing they will go to space. The mission control bros analyze data as it comes in to them. The rockets don’t have to go to space. The data doesn’t have to be real. </p>

<p>The only ones who really need to know are the astronauts (majority are masons, a secret society that requires you give your life if you tell the secrets), around 500 or so of the entire population and the real higher ups. </p>

<p>One last thought. If you had a job where you were making millions of dollars, but all you had to do was not disclose what you were actually doing, would you continue working there? What if getting the job was contingent on keeping the information secret before you had actual knowledge of it. Would you accept? </p>

<p>Not being rude but it’s naive to think all people involved with NASA would have intimate knowledge of the shit they are are trying to keep secret. </p>

<p>IMO NASA is a fraudulent organization that makes a ton of money from the gov/citizens. Why are their beginning so closely tied with the occult, fantasy (Disney who is also deeply rooted in the occult) and Nazis (von bron)?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea you raise a lot of awesome points and really like I was kind of trying to fill in this gaping hole in my own thoughts. But I guess even more so, the point of the the moon trip was to effectively win the space race so I mean isn’t there any way that Russia could’ve found out it was fraudulent? Whether it be espionage or their own research into the matter?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve thought about that a lot. </p>

<p>First, just as a thought experiment, if it were, say, impossible to go to space, I don’t think other governments, who may be hiding that fact as well, would try and disprove a “successful” attempt. </p>

<p>Another thought, and this is just my opinion from my own research, is NASA, the CIA, comparable foreign agencies, government higher ups, all stem from ancient occult organizations. These people are on the same side across country borders. Sounds crazy but if you put inthe research some sketchy shit comes to life. So if that is even close to being possible, which I believe it is, countries working together to hide info isn’t that far fetched. </p>

<p>Idk. I hope I’m wrong about all of the shit I’ve looked into, but why does the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/abbottabad-compound/FC/FC2F5371043C48FDD95AEDE7B8A49624_Springmeier.-.Bloodlines.of.the.Illuminati.R.pdf">CIAs online library have an extensive breakdown of the Illuminati families?</a> Youll find some familiar names...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay all very good points as well haha. My original reasoning for getting into all of the theories out there was honestly bc of looking into free masonry and the Illuminati so I guess I never really connected that to the moon/ NASA. I didn’t know that the CIA had that on their site either... I mean I think we all hope we’re wrong about what it would entail. You’re definitely correct in saying it’s not too bad fetched when you put it into that scope of things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Share your sentiment. I started investigating 9/11 lead me to Illuminati occult stuff, which lead me to NASA conspiracies. All insanely interconnected. Alan parsons occultist, best friends with Hubbard, who not too discreetly tried to create Satan’s spawn through sex magic is the father of rocketry and NASA. Disney, a known occultist and high ranking mason has been pumping out predictive programming. It’s just sketchy. The why is unknown and usually the down fall of these arguments which isn’t fair. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also: I was aware about the Disney and Nazi relationship but I guess I just had trouble believing so many intelligent people could be fooled, it would require insane amounts of management and siloing everyone. Especially for an operation like the moon landing. But especially in today’s age I think like how could they put out all these photos and it all be fake </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally get that. But there are videos of professionals using modern techniques to analyze light sources, camera angles, other stuff used in the photos. There are multiple irregularities where they confirm use of additional light sources as well as impossible angles based on where the cameras were positioned on the astronaughts. </p>

<p>They have been pumping out an INSANE amount of propaganda and predictive programming since the beginning of the 1900’s. Lastly, cognitive dissonance is very strong in regards to NASA and space. It’s exciting and some of people’s first experience with science and learning. Ask yourself, if you found out all of NASA was a sham, wouldn’t you feel shitty? Wouldn’t you feel like you were played. Most people can’t handle that, even subconsciously, and choose to continue to beleive because it’s eaiser, nastalgic, and popular opinion.</p>

<p>If I found out football was fixed or orchestrated I don’t think I could handle it, so there is no judgment for any of these people. </p>

<p>The last part that opens the rabbit hole, is if it was a faked, why? And that where it gets really messy. I have my thoughts and would love to speak with you about them in a dm!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im on the fence on this one too but one explanation is compartmentalization. No one has a full picture of whats going on, they know only what they need to know. Also if someone sees something fishy and wants to tell someone, why risk losing their job and livelihood? Why arent there more whistleblowers from the armed forces who witness shady shit all the time in orders given and policy of higher ups? Whistleblowers are ostracized, and ultimately silenced. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The majority of NASA employees are fed telemetry data, they said they couldnt tell a difference between a simulation or legit. The only ones who know it&#39;s fake are the astronauts and TPTB. It&#39;s all compartmentalized. The shoot for the landing could be covered under a reenactment or something. Prolly wasn&#39;t even the astronauts in the suits for the photos and video.</p>

<p>One thing I noticed the other day, so Capricorn One is based on Bill Kaysing&#39;s book, the original Apollo Hoax theory introduction. Funny enough, NASA acted as advisors on the film going as far as supplying an exact replica of the LEM and setting up Front Screen Projection for them. Just find that really really funny.</p>
