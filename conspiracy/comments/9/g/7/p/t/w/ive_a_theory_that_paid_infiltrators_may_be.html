        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a tactic I assume they commonly use. Most Pizzagate posts, especially the ones that provide a solid argument and provide an intriguing piece of circumstantial evidence, are often massively downvoted. If they reach the front page at all, it’s usually a maximum of 30-100 votes.</p>

<p>Lately I’ve been seeing posts in the 300-400 range, but it’s usually weak evidence in low effort posts with weak claims.</p>

<p>Think of it as an “alley oop” in basketball. One of the infiltrators sets up a post that provides a weak argument or has poor context. Then, a group of them “slam dunk” the ball by invading the comments section with mockery and sources rebuttals. </p>

<p>This ultimately chips away at the potential legitimacy of the investigation and scandal, and I happen to think there is substance to PG/Pedogate. </p>

<p>Just be aware of potential tactics like this.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish there was a way to have a proper discussion about this conspiracy while filtering out the partisan noise. I don’t like Donald Trump, and I have a Democratic/liberal background - but this conspiracy holds so much water when I put my partisanship behind me. </p>

<p>People who look at this conspiracy and then throw away the connections between the president and Jeff Epstein are the prime example of what is wrong with this sub. Especially when you consider the child separations at the border and shady happenings thereof. </p>

<p>Conspiracies are almost never partisan, so people should put blind themselves to partisanship ideologies unless there is substantial proof of such. </p>

<p>On the off chance that you are not being ingenious, Clinton flew 26 times on Epstein&#39;s private plane, to locations throughout America, Europe, and Asia, usually coinciding with times he was attending a conference or making a speech.</p>

<p>I have yet to see any evidence that Clinton has visited Epstein&#39;s private island. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to learn it; I just haven&#39;t seen any evidence.</p>

<p>Edwards, the lawyer for Roberts and about 10 other Jane Does, said that after he served Trump with the subpoena in 2009, Trump immediately contacted him.</p>

<p>&quot;During the conversation, Mr. Trump was open and forthright,&quot; Edwards said. &quot;I cannot discuss the substance of the conversation. But I will say that it was obvious to me that he was in no way involved in any untoward activity.&quot;</p>

<p>It goes on to say:</p>

<p>It appears that Trump cut ties to Epstein a few weeks after the non-prosecution agreement was reached. On October 15, 2007, the New York Post reported that Mar-A-Lago had barred Epstein because he hit on a masseuse at the club. Epstein denied to the the Post that he had been banned. One of the Jane Doe attorneys told VICE News a slightly different account, saying that he had been told Trump broke ties with Epstein after Epstein tried to pick up the underage daughter of a Mar-A-Lago club member.</p>

<p>Always.</p>

<p>Let me also say that there is no direct concrete evidence proving that John Podesta or James Alefantis are involved in human trafficking.</p>

<p>However, there is a <em>myriad</em> of circumstantial evidence that paints an interesting picture, and I think a legitimate investigation of the people implicated in this scandal is completely warranted.</p>

<p>This is not a court of law. This is a conspiracy discussion forum, and we are allowed to discuss the circumstantial evidence surrounding these people, and theorize as to what, if anything, may be happening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is so much circumstantial evidence suggesting that pedophilia is a big problem among politicians etc and has been for decades- the PG stuff was like a gross glimpse into bits of it. I followed it really closely at first and I think that is one of the only ways you can properly understand and get a sense of a big sort of crowd sourced effort like that because there isn’t like one journalist or lawyer condensing it all and sorting the crap from the real stuff for you- you have to do it yourself really. And for me, I saw so much stuff that was so completely abnormal and so many weird things related to child abuse etc that while it was all circumstantial, the amount of it meant that the likelihood of all these things just coincidentally being associated with pedohpilia but not actually being anything to do with it was statistically so small as to convince me something is really not right. And that’s before you’ve considered the times this kind of stuff has actually been exposed in the past. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have yet to find a single person to honestly look at all the evidence and not come to the conclusion that something is there... most doubters reject it at face value with zero knowledge about it and refuse to even look into it. </p>

<p>&quot;There is a principle which is a bar against all information, which is proof against all argument, and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance. That principle, is contempt prior to investigation.&quot;</p>

<p>One more to ponder...</p>

<p>&quot;It is the mark of an intelligent mind to be able to entertain a thought without fully accepting it.&quot;</p>

Epstein being Trumps friend has been thoroughly debunked by Epsteins lawyer and the basement is a non issue.  I dont care how many tiny details may not be 100% accurate, there is an elite pedophilia network and that is in no way shape or form debatable.   It has existed forever and there is plenty of factual/sourced evidence to back that claim up.  </p>

Has your mind ever changed on someone after learning more about them?  Do you know how linear time works?  He kicked Epstein out of his country club for shady behavior.  Epsteins lawyer said Trump is on the level and not involved.  How many people have good things to say about OJ Simpson?  Are they complicit in murder?

    <div class="md"><p>All of these people getting busted for pedophilia are examples of how deep this problem really goes. Much of the time they are politicians. You see this in the Franklin Scandal  from the 80&#39;s which also had satanic elements. The same was happening in the UK with Jimmy Saville and the people who associated with even British royalty. All of the evidence was &#39;missplaced&#39; and disappeared. They were high up in entertainment etc and you see this pedophilia in Hollywood such as what Corey Feldman talks about.</p>

The elite pedophile ring in England isn’t a myth unfortunately. In the 80’s we heard of a pedophile ring in Kincora Boys Home in Belfast created by the MI6. Shortly afterwards it was the orphanages in Wales. Then those of London, Scotland &amp; finally Jimmy Saville went down. Today everything is done to cover up the biggest scandal of all: The implication of the royal family in this pedophile ring. So we’re going to talk about Satanism, pedophile crimes &amp; a strange affair of a ceremony going wrong in the south of France.&quot;</p>

<p>Was it at the same time that they declared a classless, moneyless and stateless society?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Communism is the logical opposite of capitalism, those disenfranchised by capitalism through some means are going to look for a solution.</p>

<p>However like pure capitalism, communism is bound to fail if you add too many humans. I doubt many are pushing for explicit communism, just like outside of r/libertarianism you don&#39;t have many idiots pushing for pure capitalism.</p>

<p>The US is too far into capitalistic territory however, and would benefit from slight government intervention in its markets as well as socialization of natural monopolies now that several more have presented themselves since the last round of US socialism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well then the debunkers can’t call themselves debunkers! Debunking does not mean just dismissing something as untrue, it involves explaining why it’s not true. All the evidence PGers came up with was circumstantial but there was a lot of it, and it was extremely weird and disturbing and no one ever actually explained any of it to put peoples minds at rest, to explain how it was all a misunderstanding or whatever. No one did anything other than scoff and say oh that’s debunked. Tons of people still want to understand what all that creepy stuff is about and how it all relates with the various businesses, NGOs, trafficking, the weird emails and imagery and videos etc. It was fucking weird, and if there’s an innocent explanation many people would be v relieved to hear it, but none has been forthcoming, it’s all been made out to be some right wing weirdo thing about Hillary Clinton and a basement with no actual addressing of the actual stuff people found out. Which just makes people more suspicious and weirded out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it hasn’t, which was what made me initially spooked about it- every article saying it was debunked never actually debunked it, just claimed it had been debunked by another article, but when you went to that article it would be the same story. No one went through all the evidence and explained it all to show it wasn’t what it seemed to be. There was no decent journalism about it whatsoever and no one pointed out what it was people were worried about in order to then explain how and it what way it was all a mistake and nothing to worry about. It was just circular, the claims of debunking. Nothing was ever actually debunked, unless simply writing the sentence ‘this has been debunked’ counts as actual debunking. Really, go look it up, try and find an article anywhere that explains all the purported evidence and then debunks it. There isn’t any. </p>

Don&#39;t beat around the bush, get to the point and give your thoughts feelings, links and whatever.  Instead, the accounts we see denying things like pizzagate yammer on with the &quot;cool thing to say&quot; or express their disappointment with their perceived quality of the post and accounts commenting.  All in an effort to string people along and forum slide comments or just disrupt.</p>
