    <div class="md"><p>I get your point, but that&#39;s not right. </p>

<p>Fascism is a form of militant nationalism government that molds individual wills with laws and values of spiritual life, places the advancement of the nation above the needs and rights of any individual member, opposes extending civil liberties, and in more extreme cases try to removes them, where violence and aggression are the proper tools to use against individuals.</p>

<p>To fight and try to bring down people, structures and ideas designed to limit, restrict and/or remove rights from a certain population is not fascism. Maybe anti fascism, libetarianism or socialism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a big difference there though.</p>

<p>Left has its priority on people&#39;s rights above all else, trying to suppress those who don&#39;t have that ideal.</p>

Germany is non-white in the breeding-age bracket meaning they are going to be non-white in all brackets within a generation. Sweden is similar. Yet we&#39;re the oppressors and the villains; that&#39;s why so many people.. want.. to come.. to our countries and live off our welfare? lol the more I interact with people who are as intentionally ignorant and hateful as you are, the more I see that this isn&#39;t going to get better without armed conflict. You can&#39;t just take everything from one race, give it to all others, and say that the people you&#39;re taking from are ebil monsturs without them revolting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, definitely. Extremism is bad in any sense, and should be avoided at all costs.</p>

<p>I feel the main issue is that both sides uses extremism as a way to describe the opposite side as a whole, and reaffirm themselves in their own beliefs, instead of trying to reach a point of balance in between both.  For me, in this sense, even though I know there are racists in the right, I know that that doesn&#39;t mean  everyone in the right is racist, and many times people fail to make that distinction (on both sides of the political spectrum), and fall back to name calling, public shaming, and in more extreme cases violence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol of course, if they actually defined fascism as it is rather than just play games with definitions in order to manipulate things in favor of your party (who are such good guys, right lol), then yeah, more fascism=more purity and wholesomeness. Not my fault that you guys are all super mega mondomomma liars and hypocrites in all you do, but as you change the rules again and again, I&#39;ll continue to hold you to them :&#39;D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah. Nothing like having ideals and being among people who want to further them in the same way you do. Purpose in a world of purposelessness, that tells you to just give up, that continually descends ever further into the depths of degeneracy; brotherhood in an age dominated by individualist, isolatory, nonsensical Jordan Petersons who say &quot;well.. it&#39;s just.. you have to... don&#39;t rally around your brothers, and... remember.. we see the boy, leaving home to fight the dragon, which symbolizes, in essence... wash your penis and you&#39;ll be a man.. Remember to never love your people or fight back as you&#39;re wiped out. We&#39;re the bad guys m&#39;kay&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah me too. It&#39;s looking like we&#39;re going to have to carve that peace out of a lot of people who hate us, though. It&#39;s like a crime to be white these days, and having to morally justify the existence of  your people is something so retarded that is polarizes anyone that&#39;s asked to do it, ime. The spirit of DOTR will seriously be &quot;why did you make me do this.&quot; It&#39;s like we can literally build civilization and fill it with neat gadgets which make life easier and more enjoyable; cure a whole host of diseases which afflicted humanity since forever; give more than half of our wealth to supporting those less able; open our countries to hordes of foreign invaders; apologize for existing in the first place; and still, everyone says we&#39;re the bad guys. So, war it shall be. None of us wanted this, though.</p>
