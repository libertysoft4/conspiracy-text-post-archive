He&#39;s the reason that whenever you try to speak to someone about 23andme being corrupt, or hidden child trafficking rings people assume you&#39;re a right wing nut case and don&#39;t listen to anything you have to say. Sure he taped the bohemian grove forever ago and that was a big deal and I&#39;ll always be thankful for that. But other than that he&#39;s always been a FUCKING JOKE. We should be celebrating his ban from multiple internet platforms. Now maybe a calm, rational, credible conspiracy theorist will have the chance to shine and actually make a positive impact on this world instead of a sweaty fat douche who spreads hate and fear and tries to sell you diet supplements.</p>

The social media platforms run all the information that you consume through algorithms and it filters out what you see an what you don’t before you even “see” it. They are censoring their platform from the start.

    <div class="md"><p>So let&#39;s picture a YouTuber. Let&#39;s take H3H3 for example, one day they are hit with a TOS and all their information is removed from YouTube (where they started) and are forced to host their content solely on their own website.</p>

<p>Seems unfair for the amount of shit that gets a pass on Facebook, Jones was removed for his troubling speech and idiocy, but let&#39;s take a step back and acknowledge how much blatantly racist shit makes its rounds on YouTube because it&#39;s a fairly large number.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t like how his outreach was growing and it bothered them so they removed it. That&#39;s the long short of it. Also, I hate Jones, but I can&#39;t deny that he is starting to see radio play in areas around me now because of this fucking election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember hearing from Chris Hedges and some others that Truth-out, AlterNet, and several other generally left-leaning alternate news sites were being essentially pushed further down in Google results as a result of sites like PropOrNot branding them as being &quot;pro-Russia&quot; or &quot;affiliated with Russian propaganda.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a narrowing of the Overton window and an attack on alternative media, not just an assault on the &quot;right.&quot;</p>

<p>A. “Fighting Words”</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Free speech does not apply to “fighting words.” These are words which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.</p></li>
<li><p>“Fighting words” fall outside First Amendment protection because they:</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>&gt;a.Form no essential part of any exposition of ideas; and

&gt;b.Are of such slight social value that society’s interest in order and morality outweighs any benefit derived from them.
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>B. Defamation</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Public Officers First Amendment protection extends to defamation of a public officer’s official conduct, since such conduct is a matter of public concern. It does not apply, however, to defamation made with actual malice, i.e., with knowledge of falsehood or with reckless disregard of whether or not a statement is false.</p></li>
<li><p>Public Figures</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>&gt;a.Erroneous statements about public figures receive First Amendment immunity, even if such statements intentionally inflict emotional distress. Immunity does not apply to defamation made with actual malice. Even without actual malice, however, publishers may be liable for defaming public figures when:

&gt;i. The substance of the defamation risks substantial danger to reputation; and
&gt;ii. The publisher engages in highly unreasonable conduct departing in the extreme from professional standards.

&gt;b. The media are not protected by rights of free speech and press for obtaining news information through such misconduct as tortious or criminal activity. This is particularly true where the information is of minimal value to the public.
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>Private Figures The First Amendment does not shield the media from liability for defamation of private figures.</p>

<p>a. Private persons lack public figures’ access to the media to counteract false statements. Private individuals’ greater vulnerability to injury and states’ interest in protecting such people justify media liability.</p>

<p>b. People drawn into the public forum largely against their will are not public figures. Therefore, a publisher may be held liable, without proof of actual malice, for defaming a private person regarding a matter that is of purely private concern.</p></li>
<li><p>Group Libel Libel is not within the area of speech protected by the First Amendment. Since libel aimed at individuals may be punished, government may proscribe libel directed at groups. Restrictions on libelous expression must not be willful, purposeless, or unrelated to maintaining peace and well-being.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>C. Invasion of Privacy </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Public Record/Public Concern Freedom of speech and press renders the media immune from liability for invasion of a non-public figure’s privacy where the disseminated information is:</p>

<p>a. Truthful;
b. Of legitimate public concern; and
c. Derived from publicly available records, such as official court documents.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Government may constitutionally punish such dissemination only when the punishment is narrowly tailored to a state interest of the highest order.</p>

<p>This is incredibly short-sighted and naive. The banning of Alex Jones sets a precedent that social media companies can ban someone overnight without following their own protocols for bans or even citing specific TOS violations. And that all because the person in question is a controversial media figure. Love him or hate him, Jones is <em>the</em> alternative media mogul. If they can ban him they can ban anyone and you&#39;re a sucker if you think they won&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That wasn&#39;t what happened here, at least not on Youtube. There were no specific videos that were pointed to as violating TOS, which is what the protocol is on Youtube. They follow a three strike system. You can get two videos taken down without any additional consequences and you&#39;re banned on the third strike. Infowars went from no strikes to a total ban overnight. </p>

<p>Also, unjust bans on social media sites may not be a new thing but how often do Apple, Facebook, Youtube, Spotify, and Disqus coordinate a ban of the same person? This is new and the fact that it happened to an alternative media personality as big as Alex Jones is important.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t follow trash soundcloud music but I&#39;m pretty sure xxxtentacion wasn&#39;t also banned from every other major social media he was on.</p>

<p>The terms haven&#39;t changed though. Terms are subject to change means <em>terms are subject to change</em> not that there are no terms and the site can legitimately ban you for &quot;being a garbage person&quot; or because they disagree with you politically. This was a politically motivated ban pushed for mainly by mainstream media outlets and it had nothing to do with the terms of service.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Just fucking no. We should not be celebrating <em>anyone</em> getting banned across multiple platforms. Sure, Alex Jones is a &quot;fucking joke&quot;, and I&#39;m not going to pretend otherwise. That&#39;s why they chose him to target. He&#39;s an easy target. It&#39;s easy to justify doing this to him, and easy for people to not care. Which gives them a foundation of pseudo-justification for the next time that they pull this stunt. If we accept that anyone can be an acceptable target for this, we set the stage for them to twist things until <em>anyone</em> is an acceptable target.</p>
