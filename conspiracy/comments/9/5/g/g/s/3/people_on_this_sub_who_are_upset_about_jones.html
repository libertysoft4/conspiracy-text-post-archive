    <div class="md"><p>why so many people on this sub are upset up joneses removal. Here was a guy who could spin the bullshit so good he could convince people world war 3 was about to start . That is the name of his game he cosplays as a fed up action hero who is poised to save the awoken ones from the evils of society and government. Most people are framing this thing as despite how you feel about jones his media purge is odd , coincidental what have you . These butt hurt losers are upset at the fact that a once reliable stream of spin and bullshit is gone , now they have to face reality. There Qanon is the political equivalent of eating tide pods, Alex jones is an actor and trumpy boy is so embroiled in actual conspiracies his administration is fucked. Too bad this sub was hijacked but Trump supporters , are you guys still winning ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...That was a weirdly angry tangent haha dude take deep breaths. Judging by your comments about Alex Jones and his &quot;sick claims&quot; about child actors and Pizzagate, you seem like the type of person who would call someone evil and retarded for questioning 9-11. No offense but nothing about you comes across as intelligent or enlightened you just sound like a person filled with weird rage who hates Donald Trump and his supporters</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a Trump supporter and I get along just fine here. People being belligerent and acting in bad faith, bad mouthing the sub, calling people names to try and make a pathetic point- those are the ones who tend to get banned.</p>

<p>Standing up for AJ isn&#39;t about believing in what he has to say- I certainly don&#39;t agree with him on much. <em>However</em>, by allowing AJ to be treated this way, we set the precedent for further censure to ensue. It won&#39;t stop with him, and it won&#39;t stop with the Right. The real Left will also be treated similarly- anyone not within the accepted scope of discussion is and will continue to be shut down.</p>

<p>What is happening to AJ pales in comparison to a sub ban. What is happening to AJ is happening to us all.</p>

<p>Picard summed it up best in TNG: &quot;With the first link, the chain is forged. The first speech censured...the first thought forbidden...the first freedom denied – chains us all, irrevocably.&quot;</p>

If this is inciting violence i dont know what is you stupid fuck . also if i were banned from this sub i could claim my freedom of speech was impinged upon and my views were being stifled. Dont try to quote star trek as if it applies to this . we are talking about an unhinged asshole who spews hate for ratings and you are defending his right to do so . to quote myself &quot; assholes who incite violence should not be allowed to be on public formats they should go build there own . &quot;</p>

<p>Sounds like an analogy to me bud.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve already lost this argument with this sad excuse for a rebuttal.</p>

<p>Oh it absolutely <em>does</em> apply to this. It&#39;s not my problem you fail to realize how doing this to Jones will also destroy your own Free Speech. Not my fault you fail to understand the key element of a Republic- precedent. Or the key element of Free Speech- that you take the good with the bad in order to facilitate all its benefits.</p>

<p>Go yell at someone else- your ignorance has no power here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most educated people understand analogies i doubt any of alexs followers understand what an analogy is , but you ignored pizza gate and his claim thats dems were gonna start a second civil war . also the absolutley sick claim that there were child actors used for sandy hook . these are just a few of his bizaree claims aimed at riling up his followers. Also my main point which you missed mister quotable is no one is stopping alex jones from talking or exercising his 1st amendment rights . There are other media companies and hosting sites he can use or make his own. Why are you ignoring this fact?  Btw you know Trump called the media the enemy of the people ... Its Trump who is attacking freedom of speech . Not youtube , not apple.</p>

<p>Yet you ignore the near monopolistic power the companies that banned him possess, which means that this is actually a significant blow to his Freedom of Speech. We&#39;re allowing Private companies to dictate the realms of public debate...you see no problem there? Lol.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Btw you know Trump called the media the enemy of the people ... Its Trump who is attacking freedom of speech</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You realize...the media was never &quot;free&quot; Right? That the news has always been biased and owned. Hamilton <em>and</em> Jefferson each owned their own papers for pushing their own talking points. You harken to a reality that never existed. We must fight for the Freedom of Speech for <em>all</em>, not just those you happen to agree with.</p>

<p>You need to take a step back and look at the big picture bud. </p>

One side of their mouth complaining about TD posters, and then comes strolling on over from RPOLITICS trying to fight using the same things they are complaining about.

You can still buy his books and sugar pills from Amazon. You can still find archived videos and other similar far fetched right wing conspiracy content all over YouTube. Alex Jones is a very controversial figure involved in a lot of legal trouble for his continuous harassment of the parents of victims from one of America&#39;s deadliest school shootings. Its no surprise at all that some companies do not want a person like him on their platform. People calling this censorship and crying about oppression are acting like crybabies who have no idea how the real world works. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What’s the big deal if several major tech companies conspired to deplatform a media company that had millions of subscribers on the various platforms?</p>

<p>Besides the obvious suppression of speech, which most on the left defend because it’s mainly conservatives being deplatformed, it is also a major attack on InfoWars revenue.</p>

<p>I think these channels should file a class action lawsuit against YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and the rest because they are fucking with their businesses. They had a business relationship. InfoWars brought millions of viewers to YouTube which they profited on so fuck the free speech angle, I say they take them to court over the loss of revenue and damages to their business.</p>
