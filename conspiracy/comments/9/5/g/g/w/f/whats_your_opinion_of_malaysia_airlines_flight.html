I don&#39;t know what you consider &quot;properly&quot; but it was covered extensively when it went missing, when parts of the plane were found, when the report was released, when the search was extended, and when the search ended.

Mass murder suicide is relatively rare, but maybe increasing. Stats are tricky.  You&#39;ve got your jihadi bombers.  There have been a surprising number of pilots doing this. Do you remember the jet flying into the mountain? The pilot was distraught at the prospect of losing his pilot&#39;s license over eye disease.  He also had psych problems.  </p>

You&#39;re telling me I can watch a full length film on Netflix in the air but the fucking plane can&#39;t send its &#39;&#39; gps &#39;&#39; location to tower so they can keep track OF THE FUCKING PLANES, in case they go missing? Who cares if it&#39;s slow. I just wanna know where was the last location sent  to the tower any time in the next ohhh say 24 hours. Don&#39;t use it to navigate.

    <div class="md"><p>Ah hi <a href="/u/op-return">/u/op-return</a> as I believe I have already told you at least once GPS is receive only.  You can track planes with ADS-B as shown here with less than 100 USD <a href="https://flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/build">https://flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/build</a></p>

<p>And I believe I have also shown you this link <a href="https://aireon.com/resources/its-just-ads-b/">https://aireon.com/resources/its-just-ads-b/</a> which details how the Iridium NEXT constellation of satellites will receive ADS-B signals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like ads-b just came out this year, on an iridium satellite, with updates 2x per second up to 8 per second during performance. I use the term &#39;GPS&#39; generically, I don&#39;t specifically mean the name brand &#39;global position system&#39; but I refer to any positioning and reporting hardware or software. I am well aware of how GPS can be spoofed or the signal jammed. It is just an additional redundancy. </p>

<p>They should hide 5 PINGs in every airplane, one in each wing, one in the cockpit, one with the black box, one in the tail, and one in the main body. They would only activate in emergencies, keeping batteries fresh. It would only be $100 per plane per year, and would allow us to find all the parts of a wrecked plane. </p>

<p>No.  Not even close.  Stop just making stuff up without checking to see how much it costs.  Just your air rated battery and charger system would cost more than that...</p>
