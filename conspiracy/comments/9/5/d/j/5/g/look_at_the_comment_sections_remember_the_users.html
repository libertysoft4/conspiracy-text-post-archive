        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This Jones thing is very telling to what users on this sub are really about. Freedom of speech is not just a law on paper that only has jurisdiction over certain places. Freedom of speech is a concept. </p>

<p>Freedom of speech is important because america is a democratic republic. Without an informed population a democratic system does not work. </p>

<p>We all know the corporate media all sings to the same tune. There has been many issues that Alex Jone&#39;s website was the sole information source on. The sole source of discussion outside of the corporate media&#39;s thought constraints.</p>

<p>We know this transition is happening because the midterm elections are coming. They want to better control the narrative for the elections. Therefore they are getting rid of opposing views. Do you support that kind of thing? Who really supports that kind of thing? If your views are so great and philosophically strong then why would you suppress opposing views? You would welcome the debate because truth wins. </p>

<p>The reality is that this is the tactic of deceivers. When you try to do an illusion, a magic trick, and there is that one guy pointing and saying &quot;I saw him put the bunny rabbit in his pants&quot; the magician will kick that guy out of the show because he ruins the trick. </p>

<p>The users ion this sub supporting this purge have exposed themselves for who they are. </p>

You are OK with only corporate news on TV and also only corporate news on social media platform.

<p>I’m not a conservative. So should I still worry about free speech?</p>

<p>Another thing I’m curious about is the role of the judiciary. Isn’t it their role to protect free speech?</p>

The one time freedom of speech was threatened during this whole &quot;free speech&quot; right wing bullshit movement was when trump encouraged the NFL to fire people who took a knee during the national anthem. That was actually a federal offense. </p>

<p>In regards to what I said about conservatives, I was just shedding some light on the fact they claim to be the party of small government/low regulation but are always the ones crying for the government to get involved in shit. Make abortion illegal, make gay marriage illegal, make laws that keep same sex couples from adopting, start a war on drugs, give farmers 12 billion dollars in bailout money, subsidize water for farms, etc. Why is it that they only want the government to stay out of things where they can actually help people like free education, healthcare, housing programs, and veteran aid.</p>

<p>Are you serious? The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eeg4J8yNk4g">FCC</a> does what it wants. Back in the day it would only allow wholesome family propaganda. Nothing our government agencies do is because of the peoples will. If that was the case Net neutrality would not be repealed, we would not have gone into several of our last few wars. We would not be forced to pay for healthcare and be fined if we do not. We would have a say in how our tax dollars are spent.</p>

<p>Google Facebook and Twitter sit at the table of presidents.  They are massive PUBLIC companies that have grown with the direct help of the US government.  When these monopolistic platforms become slanted to one side it is unfair.  Just as you appreciate your ability to post your opinions here on Reddit, conservatives should be allowed to have their say. Why should liberal elites decide that conservatives be stopped?  </p>

<p>Do your own research here in this sub.  But, now this is so ironic and speaks to the main point.  If you google;  &quot;Sandy Hook False Flag&quot; 12 months ago, you would see lots of supporting videos, articles, opinon pieces.   I just did.  Everything is being scrubbed off these platforms.  If you dare to ask questions people are calling you unstable.  </p>

<p>Google;  Wolfgang Halbig - he is probably the most prolific examiner and has uncovered lots of evidence the school was not operational at the time of the shooting.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/WolfgangWHalbig/">https://www.facebook.com/WolfgangWHalbig/</a></p>

<p>More to the point; </p>

<ul>
<li><p>the Attorney General of Connecticut argued against releasing the 911 calls, where the court ruled against him;  Why? </p></li>
<li><p>the Clerk of Newtown entered into secret negotiations with the state legislature to avoid issuing death certificates;  Why? </p></li>
<li><p>a special panel of the state legislature recommended that any state employee who released information about Sandy Hook other than via Freedom of Information Act request be prosecuted as an E-felony with a five year sentence;   Why? </p></li>
<li><p>those who were hired to participate in the demolition of the school
building were required to sign life-time gag orders that prohibit them
from talking about what they saw or did not see during its destruction.  Why? </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Stop calling them private companies.  They are not.  The federal reserve is technically &#39;private&#39; but should we not audit them?  Many say yes.  Should Facebook censor opinions?  I say no, you say yes.  My position is noble, yours is against freedom and speaks volumes to the type of person you are.  You are on the left and buy into socialists control.  You are the problem, not me.  </p>

<p>You are a leftist. You let them bend you over and have their way.  Such a blind ignorant fool to let people censor dissent.  Communists do this, Marxists do this,  the LEFT kills everything, the RIGHT supports freedom.    </p>

<li>enabling internet censorship (net neutrality repeal), </li>
<li>enabling the destruction of our school system (DeVos, privatization, funding vouchers, funding religious indoctrination)<br/></li>
<li>Immigration crackdown (taking kids away from parents, changing rules to remove people here legally, travel bans)<br/></li>
<li>literal removal of government data from government websites (we paid for those)<br/></li>
<li>hides visitor log to white house  (American sunshine laws)</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, when you take a deeper look, it’s clear that Alex Jones and InfoWars are a government-sponsored cointelpro-style disinfo campaign. Their purpose is to “gatekeep” and provide a forum for people who believe in conspiracy theories to control and distract them from digging into the real dirt. For confirmation, just look at what AJ won’t discuss and who he won’t criticize.</p>

<p>It also associates conspiracy theorists with the right wing, furthering political divides and again, keeping people from the issues that really matter. Finally, it makes conspiracy theorists look completely insane by association, keeping the general public from looking into conspiracies at all. Win, win, win for TPTB. </p>

<p>Banning them plays into this. As another user suggests: &quot;This validates AJ&#39;s disinfo and it sets up a perfect precedent for future industry-wide deplatforming of political personas.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a very difficult issue and one that really ups the PSYOP.</p>

<p>On one side, Alex Jones is the worst nightmare for conspiracies, as he recent efforts to grapple independents into a partisan mindset AND his accusations that everyone&#39;s a &quot;crisis actor&quot; make a mockery of conspiracies. Those who bought into Alex Jones and became Republicans were fooled.</p>

<p>On the other side, because Alex Jones is such a sickness, the censorship of him off the internet will become accepted by more Democrats.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a tip. Don&#39;t share garbage sites and articles just for the LOLz. Even while you are outraged by the censorship all day long (and rightfully so), the net effect on society is to increase tolerance for censorship.</p>

<p>Just because too much censorship is <em>morally wrong</em> doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t live in a world where we can control it all. Swamp the people with junk and more people support censorship. Do your little part. Keep the independence and quality up and keep the LOLz and the false information down.</p>

<p>And this isn&#39;t about Freedom of Speech anyway. It has to do with the Sandy Hook lawsuit. That lawsuit is going to change how people can use a media platform to talk about conspiracy theories. And because I am saying that does not mean that I believe SH was real or fake. If these people really did lose children in the attack, then they shouldn&#39;t be portrayed as anything but victims and left alone. But, because of the theories that Jones(and others) put out there, people didn&#39;t allow that. They have been attacked online, harassed and stalked. Making their lives even worse. Jones/Infowars are the biggest name in the biz so they are the target. Web based companies cannot continue to show his content when he is being sued for making people&#39;s lives worse after they lost children. Especially when the lawsuit hits. People will be yelling about why they are allowing him a platform to spread his message. Companies don&#39;t need Alex Jones that badly. </p>
