<p>After all those dastardly democrats own the house and senate. The conservatives can&#39;t get a well needed break.</p>

<p>Hang on? That&#39;s not right...</p>

<p>Trying to politicize this is a good strategy. It&#39;d probably work with pretty much anyone other than Alex Jones. Yes he&#39;s conservative but he&#39;s also a huge piece of shit. His harassment of the victims families of the Sandy Hook shooting. They finally had to take the asshole to court. He&#39;s had plenty of straws. Hopefully, this will be his last. His brand of hate should not be tolerated...</p>

<p>Given the recent events finding what you asked for would probably require slogging through a bunch of shit. His YouTube channel is offline.

<p>I certainly agree. It can be a very traumatic experience to have this realisation, but on the flipside, if you can power through it, <em>immense</em> growth and understanding is on the other side. </p>

Jones is not having his speech taken away...just where and what he can use to spread it. YouTube, Twitter  etc..can all say they dont want mudity or kiddie porn on their services and then remove the people putting g that stuff up.

    <div class="md"><p>AT&amp;T is a service provider and a common carrier though.  Facebook is neither of those things.  Different rules apply.</p>

<p>That said...this is exactly the type of thing that Net Neutrality was designed to prevent at the service provider level (again, not Facebook) and those protections have been stripped away, so AT&amp;T certainly <em>could</em> do this as far as their customers are concerned by filtering out anything Alex Jones related if they were so inclined.  People like Alex Jones fought for companies to be allowed to do this very thing.  Personally, I find it hilarious that they are the first ones to start crying about it when it is their stuff that is being censored.  They <em>demanded</em> this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it’s not. The cake shop owners do not have to create unique artwork for the gay couple. They do, however, have to sell them cakes that are available for all customers to buy.</p>

<p>YouTube has a standard service. They are denying some people that standard service because of their political beliefs.</p>

<p>This is completely different than forcing a person to create artwork with their own two hands. If someone goes into a cake shop and asks for a swasticka to be put on it, the cake shop owner may refuse, but pre-made cakes are still available to buy.</p>

<p>Do you understand now? This is simple stuff. It has to do with creating art, not discrimination by denying service.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For what it&#39;s worth I&#39;m not entirely settled on the issue myself. Like on one hand I don&#39;t think you should be forced to do something that you don&#39;t want to do. From how you put it I sort of agree, but in the case of Alex Jones, it&#39;s not a political position for him, he&#39;s already admitted it&#39;s all just an act, but most of what he says is outright lunacy or in the case of Sandy Hook, actual harrassment of grieving families. He has a dangerous radicalized base and just like how YouTube doesn&#39;t allow nudity they can decide they don&#39;t want to host his content. With how much corporate power the right has given to companies something like this was bound to happen, if YouTube or Facebook can take down neo nazi content and refuse to give them a platform they can do the same to Alex Jones. It&#39;s not about censoring political content, it&#39;s literally the free market at work. Most people find his content dangerous and offensive, they voiced their displeasure to advertisers and advertisers voiced their displeasure to these social media platforms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s literally a direct summary of the Supreme Court case. You cannot force someone to create art. It&#39;s still illegal for a businesses to discriminate. You don&#39;t seem capable of understanding that compelling speech/art and discriminating while offering a standard service are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>If a gay person comes into a cake shop and wants to buy a cake behind the counter and gets refused because they&#39;re gay, that&#39;s illegal. There is no art that the cake owner is being asked to make.</p>

<p>Both are issues, but the second action is far more troubling in my book as it implies collusion with intent to harm, censor, and blacklist.  This level of co-ordination likely falls under Sherman anti-trust regulation.</p>

<p>Jones is the equivalent of a WWE heel, but that doesn&#39;t mean he should be purged from the net.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that there are some troubling issues here.  I absolutely do.  And the possibility of collusion between Facebook/YouTube/Twitter is a great point.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t come even close to comparing Jones to a WWE heel though.  He&#39;s not playing a bad guy on TV.  He&#39;s a bad guy who has a TV show.</p>

<p>I actually agree with the premise that banning Jones was wrong.  I don&#39;t agree with YouTube here.  I&#39;m just enjoying the schadenfreude of Alex Jones having to eat the shit that he so willingly served to others, as well as reminding the right that their dogmatic approach to empowering business at every opportunity has led to a world where business has as much power and influence to subvert free speech and individual liberty as they&#39;ve always warned us government would if empowered.  </p>

<p>And why wouldn&#39;t I?</p>

<p>Jones is the equivalent of a WWE heel, but that doesn&#39;t mean he should be purged from the net.</p>

<p>Good lord, I do love the theatrics from the right about Holocausts and being &quot;purged.&quot; Nobody is saying Jones can&#39;t host his own content on his own website. He just can&#39;t use Youtube&#39;s anymore because they are a private company and don&#39;t want to host people who have violated their TOS. </p>

<p>There is a free market solution here and I suggest that right start to exercise it instead of giogn on about fucking Holocausts and shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Two things. First he has Ben counter with rational arguments countless times to no avail. Second, the term public form is deceptive. It implies that it’s a publicly owned virtual venue. In reality Spotify, YouTube, etc are private forms (in the sense that they are owned by private companies) with a low bar of entry and terms of use. Private entries expressing their displeasure with how individuals use their available space both physician or virtue is in the realm of the public checking intolerant opinions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The argument against the bakery was that they were refusing service <strong>that they provide everyone else</strong> to a couple based on them being gay. No one was arguing they be forced to do something they dont like because what was being asked of them to do was provide the same exact service they provide anyone else. It&#39;s not like the gay couple was demanding a sexually explicit cake, which the bakery doesn&#39;t do. That would be more equivalent to what happened with AJ. </p>

<p>Because AJ wasn&#39;t using the services of Twitter or YT like everyone else. In fact, he was using those services in a way that explicitly went against what those companies said was allowed. No one is allowed to post hateful content on those platforms, not just AJ. AJ is being treated like any other user that overstepped the rules continually and showed no signs of stopping. </p>

<p>Do you need a more tangible example? Try this then: should r/conspiracy mods ban you, u/dscoduc, because they think you dont align politically with the sub? I&#39;m gonna guess that you dont think so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fine, if somebody else gets called out and the majority thinks it&#39;s hate speech, then so be it. The main problem here is so many like to both sides everything when there really is a huge imbalance where facts and reality are concerned. One side champions facts and reality, the other shuns them preferring to be lied to and told what they want to hear. This is Trumpism 101. Fake news to them is anything they don&#39;t like, no matter how backed by facts it is. So when you bring up what I assume is a possible liberal being banned similar to AJ, methinks it won&#39;t happen because there are none on the left who even approach what AJ and so many other rightwing nutjobs say on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Funny you bring up history books, while actively supporting a regime that is copying, step by step, Hitler&#39;s rise to power: attacking the press, going hard after immigrants, etc...</p>

<p>Those are media lies. Alex Jones attacked the corrupt mainstream media reporters holding back information, not the children. You&#39;d have to be mentally ill to continue believing the media&#39;s lies. They say Alex said something, but never post the video of him saying it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Net Neutrality did not prohibit edge providers like YouTube, Facebook, Apple etc. from banning free speech. You’d know if you read the hundreds of pages of the regulation.</p>

<p>Net Neutrality focused completely on regulating broadband providers, when it’s the edge providers that are a threat to the free and open Internet.</p>

<p>Net Neutrality had the backing of massive corporations like Google and Netflix, because it gave them an advantage when negotiating lower costs for peering, which is why the broadband companies did not support it.</p>

<p>Net Neutrality was coporate-sponsed regulation pushed by Obama and his cronies.</p>

<p>I doubt any Democrats would ever support a true Net Neutrality regulation that designated social media platforms as a public forum, because when there’s free speech, Democrats lose. That’s why they they banned Alex Jones and are purging all wrongthink.</p>

<p>Which really highlights the insanity. See, what you’re doing is calling everyone you disagree with a Russian agent. So you’re actually doing the bidding of Vladimir Putin, because if everyone is a Russian agent, then nobody is.</p>

<p>Not only are you distracting from the threat of China and real Russian agents, but also further dividing Americans and inspiring opposing ideologies to call each other traitors, which inevitably will lead to violence.</p>

<p>So there’s literally nothing you can say that will make me believe you  are pro-American. Everything you spouted screams division. I’d wager that you&#39;re a hardcore follower of Karl Marx.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly my point. Notice how they called me a Russian agent because  I disagreed with the Net Neutrality regulation, which was supported by Google and other corporations funded by China. Ironic.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the intention. It&#39;s pretty clear I&#39;m an American. I have better grammar and sentence construction than the TopMinds top 1%. But the division tactic is trying to make everyone believe there are no genuine people that hold opinions, unless those opinions directly support the Democrats.</p>

<p>They think it&#39;s possible to discredit all of my valid criticisms of Net Neutrality by calling me a Russian agent.</p>

<p>Curious as to what I did to pit Americans against each other though, when on almost each breath you need to mention Democrats and how cartononishly evil they apparently are. Even on this sub not many people seem to be buying it. Notice how I didn&#39;t actually mention any political party? I concentrated fully on you. Maybe I&#39;m a watcher of the active agents?</p>

So, don&#39;t ban nobody in Internet, and you will have sympathy when you will be banned.
So, your quotation of some German baptist pastor, I&#39;m consade incorrect.
Jones didn&#39;t say one word in defend of oppressed Slavic nationalists in Russia by Putin-Jewish regime. No one word of condemnation about Russian aggression against neighboring countries Georgia and Ukraine which just wants to be free. About mass killing by Russians in Syria. About the imputend anti-Democracy Russian propaganda here everywhere in the USA.

    <div class="md"><p>How do you distinguish between speech intended to destroy someone’s credibility or merely make folks dislike the target vs speech intended specifically to make someone hate someone else, unless they are explicitly saying “you should hate this person and go utilize elective violence against them now” (which is how SCOTUS differentiates between hateful speech and unlawful speech).</p>

<p>For example, most Americans would say that it’s appropriate to hate (in the colloquial sense) “traitors”, “Nazis”, “white supremacists”, “racist”, etc.</p>

<p>So does speech intended to paint someone as a traitor, Nazi, white supremacist, or racist constitute hate speech?</p>

<p>Or are you relying on an implicit necessary condition that “for something to constitute ‘hate speech’ it must not be justified hate” or maybe “for something to constitute ‘hate speech’, the hate must arise from lies about the target”?</p>

<p>Even then, you could make the case that someone calling a person “racist” without ironclad evidence would be “hate speech”. </p>

<p>What’s interesting to me is how many people ITT generally are appealing to definitions of “hate speech” WAY broader than the traditional definition, which is basically the entire point of the slippery slope argument, but instead of eventually, it’s happening right now in real time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I agree that actual natsocs &amp; racists are proponents of of utterly vile ideology. </p>

<p>But you are now agreeing that your definition isn’t simply “speech that results in hate against a group” and is instead qualified by “when I personally think it’s undeserved”. </p>

<p>That’s the whole point I’m making. </p>

<p>It’s inherently subjective, by definition, and ultimately reduces to “speech I personally find very offensive”. If that is adopted more universally, it reduces to “speech that a majority of members of society ultimately finds offensive.” Which is to say, it’s something that can change with the whims of the mob, and that need not be justified factually. </p>

<p>Far right rage media anchors are terrible, and have a very detrimental effect on overall discourse and feeble minds, but I don&#39;t want them silenced. In their case, holding all broadcasters to a higher standard is the way to go. For one, having them as private, for-profit companies goes against the principle of what they are there for. They constantly hold back because of fear of losing or offending advertisers, when they should be calling out lies and misinformation like it&#39;s their job, not hosting panels just to appear fair to a side that exists only to lie and retain power at any cost, Constitutional oath and obligation be-damned.</p>

At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.</p>
