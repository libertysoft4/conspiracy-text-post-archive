        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Used as a pejorative since the 1960&#39;s to dissuade people from asking questions about the JFK Assassination, this label is STILL the go-to tactic to try and shut down debate. Calling someone a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; immediately triggers a defense mechanism in most people, as no one wants to be ostracized by others or, more importantly, their peer group.</p>

<p>Forget that nonsense. Embrace it. Be proud of it. Be glad you&#39;re not one of the sheep. And this is not something for online interactions only. It&#39;s for the real world as well. </p>

<p>So, admit you&#39;re a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; to family and friends. Don&#39;t be embarrassed and, most importantly, don&#39;t be afraid of what others think. </p>

<p>The reality is, most people ARE secretly &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;. They&#39;re just too chickenshit to admit it in public. Help them come out of the closet.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it doesnt work like that. the connotation of a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; being paranoid, wacky, and unreliable has already been established. the connotation will not leave. its like the word &quot;nigger&quot; black people can call each other it, but others cant call them that because the connotation is still attached to the word, no matter how many way/times you try to rebrand it. the whole notion of this post is ridiculous, why do you feel the need to label things and identify as a group. get away from that and you&#39;ll stopped being dismissed as a conspiracy theorist and just be a person with a different perspective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&gt; Labels are dangerous.</p>

<p>I mostly agree. I don&#39;t like labels. That said, we&#39;re a &quot;label-making&quot; species. Always have been. Language is a trap and, paradoxically, also the means by which to escape it. By embracing a label, you neutralize its negative connotation. Maybe - someday - we&#39;ll evolve beyond the use of language (symbol imagery) as a means of communication, but until then...</p>

<p>Btw, I love people who &quot;Question Everything&quot;, even the batshit crazy ones.  Mentor them. Help them. Guide them in the right direction. And, above all, laugh. As the Joker says, &quot;Why so serious?!&quot;</p>

<p>I believe in lots of things. Sometimes I believe in six impossible things before breakfast. </p>

<p>And gosh darn it! People like me. ;-)</p>

He may very well be all of those things, but it certainly isn&#39;t Russia who is pulling the strings.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a belief associated with this term. A connotation. </p>

<p>When <em>most people</em> hear the word &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; they think <strong>false</strong>. </p>

<p>I could talk about MKULTRA, Paperclip, the Business Plot, etc and people would call them &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;, regardless of how many sources I could site.</p>

<p>What people call &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; is actually just a narrative. I could talk about the Church committee hearings, some of the revelations that were brought to light regarding some of the things done to people in some of the programs uncovered, and that&#39;s all good... but as soon as I mention &quot;mind control&quot; <em>incredulity</em> strikes, and my retelling becomes a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;, regardless of how <em>factually accurate</em> that it might be.</p>

<p>In 2003, when I was telling everyone I knew that the IAEA / UN weapon inspectors didn&#39;t find shit about WMDs and that Iraq didn&#39;t have those kinds of weapons, I was called a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;.</p>

<p>The term is a pejorative and a thought-terminating-cliche, and no amount of &quot;taking it back&quot; is going to change that. I&#39;d rather not be labeled with a negative term, thanks. </p>

<p>President Harry Truman forbade the agency from recruiting any Nazi members or active Nazi supporters. Nevertheless, officials within the JIOA and Office of Strategic Services (OSS)—the forerunner to the CIA—bypassed this directive by eliminating or whitewashing incriminating evidence of possible war crimes from the scientists’ records, believing their intelligence to be crucial to the country’s postwar efforts. </p>

You don&#39;t destroy it by running from it, you embrace it...and when a shill posits their own official conspiracy theory let them know that <em>their</em> conspiracy theory is interesting.

    <div class="md"><p>&gt; Labels are dangerous.</p>

<p>I mostly agree. I don&#39;t like labels. That said, we&#39;re a &quot;label-making&quot; species. Always have been. Language is a trap and, paradoxically, also the means by which to escape it. By embracing a label, you neutralize its negative connotation. Maybe - someday - we&#39;ll evolve beyond the use of language (symbol imagery) as a means of communication, but until then...</p>

<p>Btw, I love people who &quot;Question Everything&quot;, even the batshit crazy ones.  Mentor them. Help them. Guide them in the right direction. And, above all, laugh. As the Joker says, &quot;Why so serious?!&quot;</p>

<p>I believe in lots of things. Sometimes I believe in six impossible things before breakfast. </p>

<p>And gosh darn it! People like me. ;-)</p>
