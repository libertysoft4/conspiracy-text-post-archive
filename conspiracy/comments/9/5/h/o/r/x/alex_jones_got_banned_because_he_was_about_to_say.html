<p>The people who make decisions like that decided that he needed to stop talking, immediately.  So, they made very sure that whatever it was did not get a soapbox to stand on.  A preemptive muzzling, if you will.  Seems to be working because he could have the winning lotto numbers and none of us are going to find out about it; he&#39;s off the air.</p>

<p>The consensus seems to be that it&#39;s either about the upcoming mid-terms, or the ongoing pedogate stuff. Since Jones has such a massive audience, and influenced the 2016 election, TPTB are trying to lessen his reach. </p>

<p>But in this case we don&#39;t need to speculate, since the NYTimes editorial board themselves fell on their own sword on this issue. Read it for yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. The true solution is not to fuss about who or who shouldn&#39;t be banned, it&#39;s to make our own judgement about these platforms who apply selective enforcement, and abandon them en masse for greener pastures. Reddit included.</p>
