<p>Last time I looked up “fascism” to prove a point, the definition was clearly along the lines of “an authoritarian style government that uses violence and force against opposing ideologies and viewpoints.”</p>

<p>But now they extended the definition to specifically state that it’s a nationalistic ideology with extreme biases on race.</p>

<p>Fascism doesn’t necessarily have to do with race or nationalism, right? That definitely wasn’t in the definition before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, they don’t.</p>

<p>You’re mistaking AntiFa for an organisation, with a central tenet system and singular belief in how governments can/should be run...</p>

<p>Instead of what it actually is, which is a meet-and-greet, worldwide collaboration of all ideologies that aren’t facist coming together.</p>

<p>You’re also tenuously linking violence and fascism, but not all violence is fascism.</p>

<p>However, even if none of that was true, fascism is 100% a Nationalist ideology with racial bias, so your op isn’t correct anyways.</p>

BTW in most fascist country of nowadays, which is Russia, all fundamental industries like oil and gas production, all they are named as &quot;state owned corporations&quot; which are in fact, under the full control of super rich and influential JEWS.

<p>But you are right, national socialism is not limited to Germany. People often forget that both Hitler and Mussolini were prominent socialist statesmen.</p>

<p>Mussolini published <em>Il Trentino veduto da un Socialista</em>. He was later editor of the Italian socialist Party newspaper Avanti! Under his leadership, its circulation soon rose from 20,000 to 100,000. During this period, Mussolini considered himself a Marxist and he described Marx as &quot;the greatest of all theorists of socialism.&quot;</p>

<p>From 1912, Mussolini was a leading member of the National Directorate of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI). He was later expelled from the PSI for advocating military intervention in World War I, in opposition to the party&#39;s stance on neutrality.</p>

<p>And someone asks, no, he didn&#39;t change his underlying ideology or worldview before being expelled and founding the fascist party - he merely altered his socialism to make it nationalist instead of internationalist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, it makes a lot of sense once you look into the philosophical tenets of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivism">collectivism</a>.</p>

<p>In a nutshell: the individual does not have any natural, inherent and inalienable rights; the very idea is preposterous; the rights to life and liberty are abhorrent, as they are &quot;selfish&quot;; whatever little rights man has was granted by the State, and may thus be revoked at anytime. This is often necessary, as the sacred collective supersedes the filthy individual. The &quot;greater good&quot;, as defined by the State, is all that matters; an individual life means nothing, and may be expediently sacrificed at any time on any day.</p>

<p>Collectivism is a philosophy founded on tyranny, debt, war, and death. Fascism and Marxism, two sides of the same coin, illustrate this well.</p>

<p>One last thing: modern neoliberalism is the &quot;perfect&quot; syncretism between the two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, they don’t.</p>

<p>You’re mistaking AntiFa for an organisation, with a central tenet system and singular belief in how governments can/should be run...</p>

<p>Instead of what it actually is, which is a meet-and-greet, worldwide collaboration of all ideologies that aren’t facist coming together.</p>

<p>You’re also tenuously linking violence and fascism, but not all violence is fascism.</p>

<p>However, even if none of that was true, fascism is 100% a Nationalist ideology with racial bias, so your op isn’t correct anyways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct me if I’m wrong, ANTIFA wants the government to ban your guns, they want the government to regulate more aspects of your life and business, they want the government to censor and limit your freedom of speech, and they’re communists so they want to government to control your income, ideas, and production to redistribute to the rest of the country. What about that isn’t authoritarian and by proxy, fascist? At least by the original definition.</p>
