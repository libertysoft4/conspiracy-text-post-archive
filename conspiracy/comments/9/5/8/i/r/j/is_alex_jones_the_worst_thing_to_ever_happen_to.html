So people who are &quot;truthers&quot; have the ability to look into what hes talking about and find other reliable sources. </p>

<p>Not defending alex Jones, but he does say shit thats accurate. Disinfo agent? Probably. If you were approached by someone and they threatened you or your family what would you do? </p>

<p>Hes allowed to say the bit of truth he does, because he comes off as an un intellectual idiot, and there for isn&#39;t credible. </p>

<p>I dont think hes the best guy out there, but he did have an audience, and did bring attention to certain issues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, dunno how that got confused, I didn’t mean to imply you called him a free thinker specifically.</p>

<p>Are there true free thinkers?  Absolutely, it is just that some or maybe all of them are likely dismissed as crazy people by everyone else.  Every once in a while one may break through and either change the world or be condemned and killed or both.</p>

<p>The part about being dead that you mention is untrue and has been untrue for a long while, since about WWII.  TPTB long ago realized, as is rather obvious to most who think about it, that it is <em>far harder</em> to forcibly restrict speech than it is to <em>simply let everyone speak freely and equally loud</em> and then they simply manipulate opinions and erase objective fact!  Media polarization is an example, but there are certainly low-level players who don’t understand this in the media business (YouTube, Twitter, etc.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, in that case, no.  I think that <em>everyone</em> lies for many motivations whether conscious or not!</p>

<p>I try to listen to a bunch of different opinions and apply logic to form my <em>judgement of the truth</em> but that is still my own opinion of truth and colored by my own experience.  What I mean by “tells lies” is that even if I sincerely tell you what I <em>think</em> is the truth it would not be real truth, therefore a lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, also btw, this is why I generally roll my eyes at all the “Satanic Cult” stuff, it just isn’t logical or rational.  Certainly not everyone is logical or rational, but even with a lot of money illogical or irrational people rarely succeed in the situations being discussed.  </p>

<p>In fact the exact <em>opposite</em> is generally the case, the lately popular concept of sociopaths/psychopaths being at the upper levels of organizations states this.  These psychopaths are not the impulsive ones but the meticulous ones for whom logic and rationality replace emotion or empathy entirely; that is the recipe for rising to power.</p>

<p>There is no argument that Aleister Crowley’s ideas have not greatly effected modern culture...  OTO&gt;Thelema&gt;Agape Lodge&gt;Scientology (with certain Marxist offshoots being related or using this as a strategy) but this isn’t to say the leaders or even the followers of these <em>actually believe</em> in any of it!  Clearly the leaders of cults have a very mundane and practical benefit of doing so, and many of the followers likely do it because of the perceivable success of the leaders.  </p>

<p>This also functions as a practical litmus test for others:  start off by making sure the people are comfortable renouncing God, not because these people believe in God or require obedience to Satan, but because it shows commitment to the self and that they are not afraid to transgress.  As it goes on the system if a perfect way to separate the valuable psychopaths from the “useful idiot” follower lackies from those with moral qualms who might be a risk!</p>

<p>That is my general take anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah idk if satan is real, but i follow the entertainment industry heavily and there are tons of occult symbology in videos and photos. See politicians using the same hand signals. Shit even a pic of buzz aldrin on the cover of time magazine throwing up the 3 6&#39;s.

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t doubt any of this stuff, I am simply questioning the motive and belief.  Think of the cliche college movie fraternity induction...  sure they may actually have some crap like that but it is well understood by any in the fraternity that the actual purpose is networking and perks for members, the rest is just... bullshit.</p>

<p>I suppose the best way to state it is that I think these people are total atheists and the only “god” they believe in is their own ego.  So one who looks at it <em>from a Christian perspective</em> could clearly call it “Satanic” the actual thought of the “insiders” is not at all mystical.</p>

<p>As for Hollywood, that industry is subject to both trends and imitation and showmanship...  “Satanic Illuminati Cults” are really <em>in</em> right now, so obviously the entertainment industry uses it.  There are literally people who make their living by scouring the internet and pop-culture attempting to assess and predict fads for that industry so they can appear to <em>set the trend</em>; it is recursive as hell and subject to imitation of whatever is “cool” at the moment:  Spies in the 1960’s, Cultural Degeneration in the 1970’s, Sci-fi and Fantasy in the 1980’s, Aliens and Terrorists in the 1990’s, Superheroes in the 2000’s and Satanic Illuminati now.  (That isn’t meant to be exhaustive btw.)</p>

<p>Also, while I don’t doubt that there are many numbers of groups with “secret handshakes” you must consider the sickly obsessive nature of celebrity worship.  Any time these people are anywhere there are hundreds of thousands of images taken from all angles, it is very easy to find odd looking gestures in some.  If you were photographed 100 times per minute for an entire evening, think of how many awkward or strange poses could be captured...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s why im inclined to believe its satan or satanic. If you follow nasa, you know theyre full of shit. They&#39;ve been caught tripping over their own words a ton of times. Now for arguments sake,  you can find a nasa clip of them stating the universe is comprised of binary code. Literal 1s and 0s. Mix that in with all the CGI images you get from &quot;space&quot; and well you know the rest. There is a physicist by the name James Gates i believe that also states down to the most fundamental levels of our reality is binary code as well. My whole point to this is, if space isnt real, and it&#39;s just a simulation or a program, that would give some legitimacy to bible. The fact that we are special. We&#39;re not just this little blip floating on a rock through an infinite universe. So if there is some accuracy to that, then satan could be real as well. </p>

<p>As for the photos, i agree. Though like i said, buzz is on the cover of time magazine doing this. Multitude of celebs doing it in photo shoots and music videos. These arent just random paparazzi pics, these are choreographed. Of course these guys may have no idea what theyre doing and just are doing as told by their handlers. </p>

<p>Like you called them psycho paths in your previous post. I dont think its a coincidence that most of the people in positions of power are also into some nasty shit. We see it coming out all over the place and more frequently. For example, good ole jimmy saville. Accused of raping and molesting over like 500 people. This guy was in tight with politicians, actors and actresses, and even the queen of england. Well if this guys doing it, whatre they doing as well? And of course that didnt even come to light until a few years after his death. In the US you just had that speaker of the house get in trouble for some pedo type stuff. He&#39;s high up with a lot of acquaintances as well. So who else is in the mix? Its almost like to get to a certain level, you have to be dirty, and why is that the case if there isnt something evil behind the curtain? Yeah know.</p>

<p>I mean of course, this is just an opinion based on &quot;facts&quot;. It seems to fit though. Go a step even further. We have the money and technology on this planet right now to fix every country and live in a pretty peaceful place.  Someone somewhere doesnt want it that way or it would happen. Why is that? </p>

<p>Watched a video with a member of the DoD from like 01 maybe 02 talking about invading iran, iraq, libya, syria, and a few other places within the next 5 years. It took longer than 5 years, but weve been in all those places. Either that man is a psychic or everything that happens on a global scale has been predetermined and planned out. </p>

<p>Again, just my 2 cents. Just my opinion. I know nothing and this is merely speculation on &quot;facts&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not disagree at all with most of this.  Yes, the pedophile rings are real.  Yes our government constantly runs covert operations with black funding both from illegal drugs and arms sales and from diverting money from other agencies such as NASA. </p>

<p>The problem is that I don’t see where any of this connects to an <em>actual satan</em>. (As in, obviously from a Christian perspective this <strong>is</strong> the work of Satan, but outside of that and what these people believe I don’t think is that Satan or God exist.)</p>

<p>I don’t see how you are making a connection between binary (which particle physics seems to always be flip-flopping on) and Satan.</p>

<p>I realize what you mean by the hand sign, but what I am missing is how that connects to Satan rather than any other number of groups or clubs which make secret handshakes.</p>

<p>And lastly:</p>

<p><em>That general strategy was laid out by Kissinger in the late 60’s!! *</em> and not like in secret memos, but in academic papers and public speeches and college lectures.  So, it was more like <strong>50</strong> years late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just that if space is bullshit, what other &quot;science&quot; is also bullshit? Which leans me towards creationism. Which means we&#39;re probably special, here for a reason.

<p>Maybe it is just a misunderstanding of terms here, but I am trying to tell you it was <em>planned</em>.  Maybe you mean the same thing by scripted?  But to me, “scripted” rather than “planned” implies a deception, Kissinger was making <em>global battle plans</em> for a new kind of war, there wasn’t a guaranteed of success any more than traditional battle plans or strategies for world dominance.</p>

<p>Second, I do t know the exact video or quote you are referring to, but I have read articles regarding the nature of matter (including space) and particle physics continually trying to find a fundamental particle and it is almost always in polarity:  positive and negative, matter and antimatter, up quarks and down quarks... binary if you will.  Others have compelling theories to suggest that matter is fundamentally a <em>wave function of space time</em>, a vibration... analogue so to speak.  I have never heard an actual scientist or physicist say that reality is binary as in “it is computer code.”  The statement is an analogy, and I think some people may misunderstand that and repeat that misunderstanding on “Some random dude talking at a webcam conspiracy YouTube channel.”</p>

<p>yes. Planned. Scripted. Same thing. Because we&#39;re told today why wars are taking place and that cant possibly be true if ita been in the making for over 60 years.... &quot;that implies deception&quot;, no thats deception at the most fundamental level lol. </p>

<p>And if we are in a simulation, maybe the computing power isnt strong enough to run a detailed version of earth, all its inhabitants, and then an infinite galaxy on top of that. So if it is computer code we&#39;re more relatively &quot;real&quot; then outer space would be. </p>

<p>I will look him up, but what I meant was to ask if he was making a nuanced point which was then misinterpreted or misunderstood and then spread by “webcam conspiracy guy.”  Like if Gates was explaining a hypothetical possibility and how that could work and webcam guy only takes away from it “OMG, simulation confirmed!  Reality is fake!!”</p>

<p>The planned/scripted thing seems like we are just interpreting the words slightly differently.  To me “scripted” means like a guaranteed outcome whilst “planned” means an outcome that is desired but contingent upon winning against opponents’ plans...  We could plan how to rob a bank and attempt to execute that plan, but that doesn’t mean we would succeed.  A scripted bank robbery would seem to mean that the police, bankers, etc are involved and let it happen for some other <em>hidden</em> purpose than for the robbers to get money such as to make people vote for more police surveillance or gun control or whatever.  A minor difference and I am not saying your interpretation is wrong, just wanted to illustrate the difference I see there.</p>

<p>As for a simulation, if reality is one, then we are considering computing power <em>far beyond</em> the comprehension of our understanding of it.  But the exact measure of that computing power isn’t particularly important.  </p>

<p><strong>If we are in a simulation, how would that actually differ from not being in a simulation?</strong></p>

<p>I mean that in literal sincerity, what is the difference between being “real” or being a self aware AI in a simulated reality built from code?  How would you even define “real” at this point?  Doesn’t the word “simulation” lose all meaning at this point?</p>

<p>Sure, all of everything that we are able to perceive could <em>be</em> a computer program and we are coded scripts that are part of that program that have attained true sentience.  But a computer program <em>can only exist on a computer that is running it</em>!  No matter how sophisticated some part of a program’s code may be, it <em>intrinsically</em> cannot exist “outside” of the program that it is part of and cannot exit the computer; if the computer running it is turned off the program stops running.</p>

<p>That means that even though our reality might be a simulation to those who created it and run the computer, it is, in fact <em>not a simulation of anything at all to us because it is the full extent of reality</em>, there is nothing beyond that we are capable of experiencing.</p>

<p>This means that the concept of our reality being a “simulation” is arbitrary to the point of irrelevance!</p>

<p>There is nothing that changes whether this is true or not.  If we are bits of code within a massive program experiencing our simulation, if we are created by God in his own image, if we are merely the product of minuscule chance in the near infinity of space-time or any other conception of our existence, what difference does that make?</p>

<p>If you were somehow shown <em>absolute proof</em> that you are in fact just code in a massive simulation, how would that information affect the way you go about your life?  In utter seriousness, is there actually anything about your actions or priorities that would fundamentally change or that you would feel morally obligated to do or not do? </p>

<p>What if you take those same actions (whatever they may be) <em>anyway</em>, starting right now but <em>without</em> that absolute proof?  Would it matter if you did them but that the objective truth is that we <em>are not</em> a simulation?</p>

<p>I am genuinely interested in your answers to these questions because these are the questions I asked myself to evaluate the “simulation” hypothesis and they are the same that lead me to find it to be meaningless regardless of the nature of our reality.  </p>
