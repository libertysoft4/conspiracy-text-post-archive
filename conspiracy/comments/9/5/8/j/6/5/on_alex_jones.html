        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is no conceivable way Alex Jones is actually a warrior for truth. His show getting pulled from YouTube has everyone stepping into his corner, but he has done a ton of damage to the credibility of those who question official narratives.</p>

<p>Alex Jones acts like an insane person. Seriously no other personality screams and yells and makes crazy faces. To any reasonable person he seems insane. He constantly takes real issues, such the study that found feminization in male frogs exposed to Round Up, and boils them down into a ludacris sounding sound bites. &quot;They are turning the fricking frogs gay&quot;.</p>

<p>There is no way Alex Jones isn&#39;t a disinfo agent, and I hate him for making people dismissive of alarming real life issues.</p>

<p>Not defending alex Jones, but he does say shit thats accurate. Disinfo agent? Probably. If you were approached by someone and they threatened you or your family what would you do? </p>

<p>Hes allowed to say the bit of truth he does, because he comes off as an un intellectual idiot, and there for isn&#39;t credible. </p>

<p>He was put in place as a government agent to corral conspiracy theorists (gatekeeper) and give them some truths (limited hangout) while distracting them from the real issues AND discrediting conspiracies in the eyes of the general public.

<p>flat earth is a psyop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look into declassified documents that we got from the Russians during the Cold War. A lot of them have to do with flat earth, light bending or reflecting off of the “firmament”, etc.</p>

<p>Also, the bible makes it clear that we live in an enclosed, geocentric universe. (Look into Dr. Michael Heiser)</p>

<p>Lots of ancient people’s believed the earth was flat: Egyptians, Babylonians, Mayans, Ancient Israelites, Native Americans, and apparently Russian Scientists during the Cold War. We often regard ancient people as being “less intelligent” than we are but to this day can’t figure out how some of their ruins were built. These people had stellar knowledge on the stars &amp; cosmos but still believed the earth was flat, how so?</p>

<p>Is he a clown? maybe.. I  would think that if he was not in on it he would have asked for help from trump to get free...regardless, someone has strings on him and are going to use his banishment as a lightning rod... ugh...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No hes not a clown. Hes literally a fucking actor. a paid performer, much like a clown, just a creepy, but not a clown. This is a step to silencing dissident and anything that goes against the narrative.</p>

<p>Although I disagree with him, he should be allowed to have a platform. Just like Nazi&#39;s, just like socialists. Everyone deserve a voice. We dont need the government telling us which ones to ignore and which to trust. We dont need a ministry of truth. That&#39;s on us to determine. Not the state or feds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;There is no way Alex Jones isn&#39;t a disinfo agent&quot; - Certainty is the position of the young and the foolish. If you&#39;re wrong, you&#39;ll never admit it to yourself... you will live and die a slave to self deception. 25 years ago, I thought conspiracy theorists, in general, were mentally handicapped. It took me 15 years to admit my error...  </p>

<p>Good luck with yours.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He drip feeds interviews from people I like, constantly. He launches careers in the alt media constantly. He is 75% against globalism, and 25% other.</p>

<p>There are LOADS of people who are 50% flat earth, 50% other, and THEY make us look stupid. Cynthia McKinney, Ron Paul, and Dennis Kucinich all get great press on IW.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust anyone&#39;s judgment, least of all Alex Jones. I just believe that YOU are splitting the community, whereas he has served as a focal point.</p>

<p>If he&#39;s controlled opposition, then the opposition is FUCKING STUPID, because MOST of the dozen or so people I know that are really into conspiracy theories got started watching or listening to Infowars.</p>

<p>David Icke is 10x the moron Alex Jones is, and he never gets targeted by the MSM. That&#39;s what controlled opposition looks like.</p>
