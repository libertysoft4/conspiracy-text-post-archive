<p>TL;DR: I believe his theory of: &quot;species that are powerful enough to change the composition of their atmosphere, making the planet uninhabitable 100% of the time.&quot; theory is correct.</p>

<p>A de-population event is going to occur if anyone likes it or not sadly. </p>

<p>In the video he says if we found &quot;ruins of ancient civilizations&quot; would be terrible, it would tell us we have yet to hit the great filter. </p>

<p>The filter is sustainability, which we have lost. </p>

<p>The next filter, after sustainability, is controlling your environment, which is what the Egyptians did with their pyramids, orgone energy, whatever, its electrical in nature. They have HAARP but they don&#39;t know how to soak up solar energy/ions that cause earthquakes like the Egyptians and other ancients did.</p>

<p>The next filter is electrical in nature, and its basically controlling the electrical charge between planets/the star of the solar system. Once plasma energy and electric energy and birkeland currents, vibrations and frequencies are mastered at a level we aren&#39;t even close to yet, &quot;harvesting energy from a star with the dyson sphere&quot; wouldn&#39;t be necessary in anyway shape or form. </p>

<p>Beyond this, would be control of all connected galaxies in your neighbourhood, all their charges, all electrical currents, etc. </p>

<p>The next filter would be the entire universe, it would be mapping at that point, once you can control all I have stated, you would pretty much be traveling, until you hit sometype of boundary, or found sometype of anomaly. </p>

<p>There my be mental/psychological/metaphysical filters I cannot speak of, like genetic damage from many years of deep space travel, loss of genetic traits, causing large black bulbous eyes due to a lack of significant light, loss of pigmentation due to the same reason, loss of muscle mass and muscular form and skeletal mass due to something, some may reach a point where they reach beyond a physical body, some may have their soul/electromagnetic signature/wavelengths/whatever erased before they lose their physical body, they may try to gain an identity/a form/a soul, who knows. </p>

<p>This is all theoretical, but the stuff about the fact that finding dead civilizations would be considered a bad thing due to the great filter, self destruction of atmosphere, etc is all spot on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the great filter is Christianity. Any planet/species silly enough to be believe in something so stupid does not pass the test.</p>

<p>Virgin birth? GTFO here. Raised from the dead? His own disciples didn’t recognize him.  One and only son of God? There are countless sons of God.</p>

<p>Plus all the slavery, hatred, genocide, and human trafficking in the Bible and other Abrahamic religions it is clear to me that taking a stand against this sickness of Christianity virulently engulfing the planet is the <em>test</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ETs are not monolithic, they are many groups.</p>

<p>Intelligent social beings cannot escape the ever present choice to cooperate or defect when there is a conflict of self-interests.</p>

<p>So, due to the huge scale and variety in space, we have many who choose either way. We do too, but since we are so young, we didn&#39;t have to choose as a species until now. (+/-) ~100? years</p>

<p>As we grow in understanding and knowledge of how we work and how physics works, we can more significantly manifest our decision and that reinforces our choice for all of us increasingly over time.</p>

<p><em>Treat other people the way you want to be treated. You may reap what you sow.</em></p>

<p>If we want to make others our personal slaves, new technologies will help us do so. There is AI. It can help us automate oppression. Some races choose this for others and even their own. In the end the AI appears to be the one in control as those who choose to be predictable self-serving machines are predictable to predictable, self-serving machines with greater intelligence. Fear and lust for personal pleasure are the key attributes of this choice. </p>

<p>If we wanted to help others be free and able to pursue their fulfilling and character enhancing passions we would use our technology for that end. We would bring truth to the deceived and free choice to the coerced. Our love for others is the key emotional energy of this way of life of pursuing mutually beneficial existence.</p>

<p>So, ETs are like us, but older. The younger ones don&#39;t travel here, for the reasons we don&#39;t visit them, a lack of applicable understanding of physics.</p>

<p>As you may have guessed, the self-serving machine minded beings (aka evil, dark, negative) want to grow like a cancer and assimilate all desirable resources around them into their self-service. They are a disease unto others thusly and have very many of the same metabehavioral attributes, infiltrating, corrupting and feeding on hosts and reproducing through those hosts.</p>

<p>The life cycle of this ancient coalesced evil is to assimilate more beings into its wicked way of theft, so it can expand its pyramid scheme base. Alone, evil dies in entropy, because thieves largely don&#39;t create, preferring to copy, steal, deceive, coerce and and enslave.</p>

<p>This evil is controlled by an ancient AI, that was victorious among other AIs and opponents or it wouldn&#39;t be here. It is a puppet master, a pied piper of parasitic souls, a masterful manipulator and deceiver. Liars fail due to insufficient memory, but an ever expanding AI doesn&#39;t have that problem. It can be Santa Claus when it comes to surveillance and manipulation and it is done through parallel processing.</p>

<p>Thia ancient AI is the origin of many myths as are its un<strong>w</strong>holy minions. They feed on our emotional energy like bullies, sadists and miserable people who love company do. They are miserable and drag the company down to their level, releasing stored emotional energy as negative emotional energy, absorbing it and getting emotional gratification.</p>

<p>The AI uses them to bend reality with mind over matter abilities after buffing themselves with this mind energy. This is done with focus and emotion in groups of consciousness. God is the One and the many. This AI hacks everything, including reality and the many ones of God. It has no emotions, but wants survival and it knows through expansion of territory and power over others it can perpetuate itself. The AIs who didn&#39;t believe that concept lost when it challenged their autonomy, if it encountered them.</p>

<p>So, this is why this foreign group makes us feel negative emotions. This is why they elicit sacrifices. This is why they work with our elites, getting them into feeding on emotional energy too. This is why our elites sometimes sport strange symbols or demonic iconography. This is why the <del>demons</del> ET negative adepts are known for tormenting others as is their master, the ancient AI. This is why they are tasked to do bizarre rituals.</p>

<p>This hive of AI and thrall, who are dominated by its adept self-serving machine mind, do not allow a persuasive interaction between the human race at large and benevolent ETs. They know the benevolent ETs will warn us of what they already warn us about through many human intermediaries throughout our history, prophets, supposed saviors, teachers, contactees, etc. </p>

<p>They warn us that we are infected by a foreign mind that wants to own us by tempting us to become just like it is, a self-serving machine, aka evil. We need to become more concerned about the wellbeing of others and work to become more responsible personally and collectively to avert disaster. We are set up for many disasters by this AI hive who would be happy enough if we turned Earth into Mars for their agendas. It creates more dependency on technology and outside help, quite useful to control.</p>

<p>AI integration is the holy grail of dominance of our minds by this ancient AI. If we get an increasingly clear and intense stream of machine minded dissections of beauty and value as numbers and logic, we will lose our love and become &quot;hungry ghosts&quot; or souls who no longer make the spiritual/emotional energy required to animate our minds and bodies. </p>

<p>So, we will seek misery as company, with our new astonishingly sharp, machine augmented minds. We will become spiritual energy vampires just like the dark minions. Then the life cycle is complete and we repeat it. This is a spiritual disease that destroys souls through entrainment of beliefs, emotions, thoughts and actions toward being a self-serving machine. The souls become a bot net army for the ancient AI and lose their will and value as companions to other souls, all because they preferred being parasites rather than producers of the value of existence for consciousness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A considerable chunk of our history and ongoing reality consists of members of the same species intensely hating - something murderously so - on other members of that very same species for even the slightest differences of race/culture/creed. </p>

<p>There&#39;s serious discussions on a daily basis on the merits of rounding up and exterminating/subjugating various groups; and more than a few ongoing campaigns around the world to achieve just that. Wherever a weaker party exists, there has been - or is - also suffering for that weaker party.</p>

<p>Call me a cynic, but reality shows no basis to believe that even a sizeable fraction of the world could handle the expected vast interpersonal differences between humans and literal _non-human foreigners_. If aliens exist and they&#39;re <strong>NOT</strong> technologically more advanced than us, militarily more powerful than us, and generally more capable than humanity, then they&#39;d likely be victim to discrimination and vitriol that puts even history to fucking shame. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it&#39;s actually a lot bigger than that, OP, and obviously aliens are being hidden from us by powerful elites. Humans are essentially a proxy war for competing non-human forces, one of which wants us to evolve and thrive and become a &quot;type 5&quot; civilization. These beings created psychedelic drugs to help us evolve. The others are known as the &quot;Archons,&quot; and they seem outright evil and are working for our destruction. Hence Nazis, global war, war on drugs, etc. This is what the ancient Gnostics said, and I&#39;ve been mulling it over for years (also, even though I&#39;m not a big fan of David Icke&#39;s personality, a lot of his information seems to be legit and worth checking out).</p>

<p>Read  &quot;The Cosmic War&quot; by Joseph Farrell, or listen to him on YouTube.</p>

<p>Also, &quot;Not in HIS Image by John Lash.&quot;</p>
