        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>About 8 months ago, I told you guys that the ultimate goal of DNA testing companies weren&#39;t about making money from the actual tests but to build the most powerful database in the history of mankind.  A complete DNA database with matching names and addresses.   </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the original post.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7g5kiy/are_you_a_fool_why_are_you_voluntarily_giving/?st=jkl3cj5z&amp;amp;sh=a766ab18">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7g5kiy/are_you_a_fool_why_are_you_voluntarily_giving/?st=jkl3cj5z&amp;amp;sh=a766ab18</a></p>

<p>Some of you agreed.  Some of you mocked me.  No matter.  It is all coming to be now.  They already sold the database to multiple pharmaceutical companies.  </p>

<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/23andme-is-getting-lots-of-money-from-big-pharma-to-sha-1827891890">https://gizmodo.com/23andme-is-getting-lots-of-money-from-big-pharma-to-sha-1827891890</a></p>

<p>Now they are selling to insurance companies who will wade through the data to eliminate high risk people from the insurance pool.  </p>

<p><a href="http://cbslocal.com/2018/01/18/taking-ancestry-test-makes-buying-life-insurance-harder/">http://cbslocal.com/2018/01/18/taking-ancestry-test-makes-buying-life-insurance-harder/</a></p>

<p>This is just the beginning.  As we discover more and more about the inner workings of DNA, they will find more and more devious methods to exploit this data.  Soon, you will find yourself categorized under your DNA profile.  </p>

<p>I urge you to write to your Congressmen to make it illegal to sell this data.   I urge you to call these companies and complain.  This is no joke.  If you didn&#39;t take one of these tests, good for you.  For those that did, I feel for you.</p>

<p>Does that <em>really</em> do anything?</p>

<p>Is the DNA testing you&#39;re talking about related to those ancestry tracing websites?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure the psychiatrist would ask for a sample, but they wouldn’t keep it.  They’re the proxy.  The testing lab used would (not many providers have their own lab on campus) gather and have that data to study.  The psychiatrist would just report effects on treatment to researchers.  Per HIPAA and your source, it’d stay w/ the researchers (technically, unless you’re the Golden State Serial Killer. At which is another posi.). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sucks, but our representative governance is based on communication between constituents and their representatives. The real problem is that writing or calling are the only routes available. People won’t even make a 90 second call to order food — something bottom wrung on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. So of course our government has become so distorted for countless reasons, but one that does not get brought up too often is the issue of genuine back and forth communication. </p>

<p>Just getting this discussion started raises more foundation level questions. How should it be set up? Do we want candidates that have known positions, or would we prefer candidates like blank slates that just purely represent their constituents?</p>

<p>Now, normally, they would just have your DNA but have no idea who it belongs to.  So they&#39;ll carry out their usual investigation, following leads, motives, etc.  They&#39;ll try to match the DNA with suspects but fail because it belongs to you who have absolutely no connection with this woman other than that one night stand.  They&#39;ll eventually get the right guy because they follow the standard procedure.</p>

<p>Now imagine the scenario where they have your DNA data and your name and address, all neatly packaged in a database they bought from one of these companies.   They look up your DNA and out pops your name and address.  Now you are suspect NUMBER ONE.  They will try to do everything in their power to prove you guilty.  They won&#39;t follow other leads or clues.  After all, why should they?  In their minds, they already have the culprit, meaning YOU.  And, if all fails, they will try to convict you on just the DNA alone.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dont give me shit about Europe being in bad shape because of global warming...</p>

<p>theres 3 main reasons europe is shit right now..</p>

<ol>
<li>Immigration lets anyone from anywhere go wherever the fuck they want. </li>
</ol>

<p>--Example: It sucks in our country, lets go somewhere that doesn&#39;t suck. (3 years later): Paris is a shanty town... Wow, fucking beautiful... Sweden is now the rape capital of the western world... Nice..</p>

<ol>
<li>Socialism</li>
</ol>

<p>--Example: This is similar to the immigration issue in that, the poor people just go and try to take shit from the people who have. Greece knows what im talking about.</p>

<ol>
<li>Overpopulation.. The whole worlds issue, really.. I actually dont think this is such a big issue if people would spread out more instead of clusterfucking on shores of the certain places that are already overpopulated.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Because of how old I am, and how I see &quot;climate change&quot; formerly known as &quot;global warming&quot; being used in schools, media, and government, to change things in favor of a certain political party..</p>

<p>Ive seen this shit happen for a lot of years and I remember them telling us shit in school that was so fucking dumb. I remember them telling us that in 10 years, the earth was going to be completely out of oil and we wouldnt be able to use fossil fuels anymore... Soooo That was like 1998 - 1999... Huh... Here we are.. 20 years later.. Weird huh? Not saying we <em>havent</em> contributed anything.. Do not get me wrong, Im not saying we are completely blameless and theres nothing we&#39;re doing that impacts the environment.. But idiots like Al Gore and Obama just advertise shit like this for political points for their party. And once everyone believes it, they get all the young kids believing it too.. Then, you&#39;re paying taxes on it, and theyve got you literally arguing against your own livelyhood that you * should be* paying more higher taxes on everything from cars, food, water, land.. EVERYTHING.. They convince you that if you want to use the environment, that&#39;s fine, but you&#39;re going to need to pay a tax. Give the government money, and we&#39;ll allow you to use what you want... That way the government controls how much water you&#39;re allowed, how much food you can eat, how much space you can take up, what you can buy, things you can use for any reason at all... </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m 100% for regulations against shit like dumping chemicals just in to streams and turning rivers in to sewage. I hate that. But they&#39;re trying to take it too far, and that is my major point.</p>

<p>You do come forward because you&#39;re innocent and you realize that not coming forward makes you look guilty as hell (the police would assume that you raped her as well as killed her). The information you give helps the police track some of your movements after you left her home which backs up your statement and probably finds a witness for your location.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and it isn&#39;t necessarily a conspiracy or that the police are bad people (anymore than the average person anyway).  It&#39;s human nature and resource constraints.  Humans look for explanations and patterns.  When we can&#39;t understand why something happened or there is no reason, we have a hard time coping with that.  Add on top of that that there are pressures to solve crimes quickly, not to waste time and resources, etc.  I can see how it happens.  It would be easy for most people to make hasty conclusions when a potential explanation comes along, rather than do due diligence.  </p>

<p>Of course, no one is served by this, ultimately.  Sure it &quot;looks good&quot; at the time.  But an innocent person has their life ruined, the guilty party escapes and likely will never be caught, and it is expensive in terms of time and resources - all the time and resources that went into investigating, charging, and convicting the innocent party are wasted and, in many jurisdictions, compensation will be required, so that can be added to the bill.  If people thought more long term, they might make more effort to be diligent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely.  If you speak to the police, even if you have good intentions and haven&#39;t done anything wrong, it is very easy to make a mistake and say something that can be twisted or that is inconsistent.  At that point, you have, inadvertently, furnished evidence against you and your credibility.  People think that as long as you have done nothing wrong nothing bad will come of talking to the police.  This isn&#39;t true.  Their interrogation tactics are designed in such a way as to produce many false confessions.  I would never speak to the police if I suspected that I was under suspicion.  I would immediately lawyer up, even though it would hurt me financially.  Taking the financial hit how is much better than ending up going through a whole trial and maybe ending up with a criminal conviction.  And I&#39;m saying this about Canadian police.  Multiply this by like a million for the American police - they are much worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, you should come forward and speak to the police with a lawyer. It&#39;s one thing to not trust the police but it&#39;s another to be paranoid that they will try to pin the murder on you. Even if you think that it could make them suspect you, it is better than not coming forward, them finding you anyway (e.g. a neighbor who saw you there) and you being a far bigger suspect. There&#39;s even a chance that the case isn&#39;t solved and your DNA is flagged years later.</p>

<p>For witnesses / alibis; How do you travel from the girls place to your home? How many people do you pass on the way? How many CCTV cameras do you pass? Do you buy anything using credit cards? Do you use your mobile phone? 
Unless you drive to your empty home on your own, without using your phone or stopping to buy anything and you miss all CCTV and traffic cameras, there will be some evidence to show that you weren&#39;t at the girls home at the time of death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not paranoia when it has happened historically.  There are  famous convictions where the police have pinned murders and other serious crimes on someone who was just an innocent party that knew or had a chance encounter with the victim.  They became fixated on that person being guilty and,  in so doing, made the evidence fit, forcing confessions, twisting their words, or even fabricating evidence.  One wonders how many cases just didn&#39;t get the publicity or remain undiscovered.</p>

<p>In terms of witnesses, let me ask you this, suppose you are walking/driving home from your job.  How much do you remember about the people you see on any particular day?  Likely, not much unless anything remarkable happened or you always see the same person.  Now, how much will you remember a day later, a week later, a month later, etc. about that particular day.  Nothing.  There will be no witnesses because even if someone saw you, they probably won&#39;t remember it.</p>

<p>You might encounter some CCTV and be filmed, but you might not.  It depends on where you are.  And, even if there is footage, companies and even the government may not retain the footage for a long period of time, so a clock would be ticking on that.  As for making purchases, not everyone would stop to buy something on every trip they make, not everyone uses a credit card for each purchase either (actually, a larger proportion of people than you might think do not even own a credit card).  </p>

<p>In any case, my point is that it would be up to you to conduct all this investigation if you decided to go to the police without a lawyer.  If the police have decided that you are the guilty party, they will be very likely not to investigate to exonerate you as they will consider that to be a waste of resources - they have their man.  And you, given that you are accused of murder, will be in jail, so you&#39;ll have to hire that attorney to investigate for you.  Hope you have the $$$.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, you don&#39;t remember the people who you pass on the street but you do recall people you interact with. Thinking about traveling back to your house, from her house, and you have the following possibilities:</p>

<p>Get an Uber: You have the driver as a witness and it is charged to your card.</p>

<p>Get a taxi: A witness and a receipt</p>

<p>Get a bus: They have CCTV installed, you&#39;ll have a receipt and the driver will hopefully remember you (plus any other passengers)</p>

<p>Get a train: A witness in whoever you buy a ticket from, the ticket inspector and other passengers, a train ticket and a receipt as proof of the journey, CCTV in the train station and on the train.</p>

<p>If you go to a shop then you&#39;ll have a witness in whoever is working there, CCTV footage of you in the shop, a receipt and possibly a credit card record of the purchase. 
If you use your phone then what record will the phone company have? Do they log an approximate location based on cell towers?</p>

<p>It&#39;s difficult to imagine the police just not looking for any proof of your alibi. If you believe that the police have bad motivations then they would investigate your alibi to try and find evidence that you were lying to them.
Also, if the police decide to not investigate your statement, a defence lawyer should rip them apart for that and to do so would only need a single receipt/card statement/CCTV clip/witness to make the police look ridiculously incompetent in front of a jury. Couple that with there being zero actual evidence that you committed the crime and whatever evidence there is that someone else committed the crime...</p>

<p>Maybe my lack of a criminal record and having no bad experiences with the police makes me naive but, if it were me in this specific situation, I would go to the police and I&#39;d be confident that they wouldn&#39;t try to pin the murder on me</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe, but I&#39;m just thinking about the time I lived by myself for three years of university.  Most of my nights after class would have had no alibi at all.  My professors probably would have remembered me in class because it wasn&#39;t an undergrad program, so class sizes were small, but after that...  </p>

<p>I walked to the bus stop.  There was no CCTV on the streets of that city (well, one area because of some theft issues, but I didn&#39;t typically go there at night), so no camera.  I got on the bus and would go straight home.  Student life, so my disposable income was limited and my shopping trips (e.g. groceries) would typically be on the weekend when I could combine them efficiently with the bus schedule.  My bus pass was the student ID and was merely glanced at - so, no record of it being used and I was just another student.  Not all buses have CCTV and that bus line did not, so no record there either.  Maybe someone would remember me on the bus, but then again probably not. </p>

<p>So, then I get to my stop, which is in a residential neighbourhood and there&#39;s no CCTV there either.  Usually I wouldn&#39;t even see another person, but if I did they&#39;d probably not remember me as I fit in with the neighborhood despite being a university student.  I get to the house where I rent the apartment and the landlord is hardly ever home - always at work - so probably she doesn&#39;t see me either.</p>

<p>And I think you misunderstand.  If you said - oh, I was at ________ store, not murdering that person - the police would probably check that - that is specific enough they&#39;d follow up.  But if you said, oh, I was walking home and someone must have seen me, they probably wouldn&#39;t canvass for witnesses.  They&#39;d probably say - well, who saw you?  And you probably wouldn&#39;t know unless you happened to run into someone you knew.</p>

<p>As for court, police receive the benefit of the doubt from juries.  They are presumed to be credible and skilled.  As an accused, you are presumed guilty, not legally, but by them as people.  There is bias there.  Not to say that they can&#39;t spot a shoddy investigation or a person arrested by mistake, but the bias is against it.  Wrongful convictions happen all the time.  And, more commonly, people are forced to simply plead to charges because they are wrongfully arrested based on shit like this - how long do you think you&#39;d last in jail without income?  You don&#39;t get bail for murder.  Not long I&#39;d wager.</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t naïve for those reasons.  I also don&#39;t have a criminal record or particularly negative experiences with police.  The difference in my case is that I have read about these cases, I know how far they can go within the law (and outside the law but within the tolerance of the courts), and I also have a retired police officer as a relative.  I know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, I am in the UK and I&#39;m not aware of any murder convictions which have later been shown to be stitch up jobs by the police. They probably do happen though. The point about people in the US taking plea deals even though they are innocent is a good one. That part of the justice system sucks, as do prosecutors who only care about getting convictions </p>

<p>In the example, the police would trace the girls movements for the previous day and they would find out that she left the bar with a random guy pretty quickly. After that, they will probably find you pretty quickly. That&#39;s the biggest reason why you should voluntarily speak to them, with a lawyer present.</p>

<p>More generically, I was thinking that if you can prove any of your story then I didn&#39;t think that the police would try to pin it on you.
E.g. If her time of death was 10am. You left her place at 9am, walked home in ~60 minutes but stopped at a shop after ~30 minutes. There is a witness in the shop that you stopped at, at 9.30am. The police could try to say that you went back to the girl&#39;s home after the shop and you can&#39;t prove that you didn&#39;t. 
I don&#39;t think that the police would really try to pin the murder on you. If they did, I can&#39;t see how they would be successful. While you can&#39;t prove 100% that you didn&#39;t do it, they can&#39;t prove that you went back to her home either and they won&#39;t have a motive for why you would do it (apart from them just outright making theories up).</p>

<p>If there was no evidence to support your statement about what you did after leaving her place then I guess they may go after you but there needs to be no evidence that anyone else was there and no-one else had motive. I still think that they will check to find a jealous ex boyfriend (or even current boyfriend!), or someone already in her life who has motive, and that they would find a better suspect</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There probably are some...or they just haven&#39;t come to light.  There have been some awful cases in the US and Canada.  I&#39;m Canadian, so I&#39;ll cite the Canadian ones:</p>

<p>Steven Truscott is perhaps the most famous.  In 1959, he was sentenced to hang (fortunately that was never carried out) at 14 because he gave a girl a ride home on a bicycle.  The police never looked at anyone else and never investigated the man he described seeing or the car he witnessed the girl getting into.  He was exonerated decades later in 2007.</p>

<p>Another very famous case is David Milgaard.  He was accused of murdering a young woman in 1969 and convicted based on the testimony of three men - one who admitted he cared mostly for the reward and two who told inconsistent stories.  The police didn&#39;t follow up on a tip in 1980 that indicated someone else had likely committed the crime and the government fought his attempts to seek review of his case for years, including declining to hold a new trial despite the recommendation of the Supreme Court of Canada.  In 1997 DNA was tested and it was found not to match, exonerating him.  The person from the tip in 1980 was arrested and convicted for the murder in 1999 and the government finally had to admit culpability and provide compensation.</p>

<p>James Driskell was convicted in 1991 for shooting and killing his friend on the basis of hairs found at the scene.  The RCMP and prosecution misled the court as to the reliability of the evidence and didn&#39;t follow disclosure obligations to the defence.  When the hairs were actually tested (more than a decade later) it was found that none of them actually belonged to him.  He received a new trial, which was ended short of a full acquittal, in 2005.</p>

<p>In 1987, Anthony Hanemaayer was charged with assaulting a 15 year old girl at knifepoint and pleaded guilty on the advice of his lawyer who warned him he would otherwise receive a long prison sentence.  He did two years less a day.  Later, Paul Bernado (Canada&#39;s most notorious rapist and serial killer) confessed to the crime.  Hanemaayer applied to the court for an acquittal and received it in 2008.</p>

<p>Simon Marhsall was convicted in 1997 for a series of sexual assaults, which he confessed to the police when questioned.  He was imprisoned until 2004 when DNA evidence cleared him.  Marshall was mentally handicapped, calling into question his confession, and at the time of the investigation the police didn&#39;t bother to test the physical evidence.</p>

<p>There are many other cases.  The common threads are a refusal to test evidence and properly investigate, lack of compliance with disclosure, misleading the court, a refusal to admit that one is wrong, forcing people into shitty plea deals because of their circumstances, etc.  I actually know a retired police officer who <em>still</em> insists that some of the people cleared by DNA evidence and new trials are guilty.  That&#39;s how bad the tunnel vision can be.</p>

<p>I know we&#39;re taught to trust the police and generally you absolutely can. But when their suspicion turns against you, they aren&#39;t there to protect <em>you</em> anymore.  That&#39;s what your lawyer is for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This actually leads to a really interesting larger question about the future of insurance. From a purely technical standpoint, if insurance providers (home, auto, medical, life, whatever) had perfect and infinite information, we would all have unique and customized premium costs based on our anticipated needs. I don&#39;t love the idea of car insurance being tied to gps tracker info and an assessment of locations visited (&quot;visits 3+ bars per month: +10%, drives on average 5 mph over the speed limit: +5%, works from home Tuesdays and Thursdays: -2%&quot;), but that would arguably be more fair than the current system. 🎵Like a good neighbor, State Farm is <em>watching you constantly</em>...🎵</p>

<p>You are actually far better off knowing you have an increased chance of whatever because of your DNA.</p>

<p>Your DNA in most cases isn&#39;t necessarily your actual future. For things like diseases the majority of the time it&#39;s an increased likelihood but by knowing you can actively make changes to lower your risk factors. So much disease is lifestyle related or epigenetically triggered that while an insurance company may not want you your knowing means you could avoid it instead of blindly living your life increasing the chances every day</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As much as I agree with you, and as much as I hate these DNA testing scams, there is one potential silver lining to all this.</p>

<p>Having a massive database of DNA, with corresponding surveys of things like family history, medicial issues, etc. could potentially be the key to learning more about DNA than we could ever possibly imagine with the current methods and techniques. Granted, that would mean relying on &quot;altruistic&quot; and honest researchers attempting to gain knowledge for the benefit of humanity (fat chance these days with how political/profit driven scientific community has become), but it&#39;s not completely out of the realm of possibility.</p>

<p>Cures for cancer, cures for <em>everything</em> really, more advanced CRISPR applications, etc. Hell, even unlocking the keys to understanding genetic memory!!!</p>

<p>While I&#39;m with you about being completely against it and would never in a million years voluntarily submit my DNA to such a service, and agree that this data will undoubtedly be abused by insurance agencies and the like... the scientific potential is quite fascinating to think about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, yeah, in several areas, primarily in the subjects of hypothermia and rewarming and experiments with phosgene. But thats just some of it. </p>

<p>Germany was the most advanced country in the world when it came to medicine and science. In fact, doctors and scientists would typically learn German if they wanted to be the best in their fields, (the most advanced textbooks were written in German) as well as study in German universities. So the most advanced country in the world was able to experiment without ethical/moral constraints...but tainted with racism and Nazi ideology. Yes, much of the experiments were flawed due to poor controls and racial bias, but some of the research was useful especially on how to deal with cold weather combat conditions -- so much so that the NATO book on the topic is largely unchanged from what the Germans wrote then, in some small part based on the torture they perpetrated. Some torture-research on high altitude simulation and pressurization may have sped up German development of G-suits and pressurized high altitude heated flying suits, an area where the Germans had a lead. They also contributed to various war inflicted injury treatment methods which are used in modern medicine by trauma surgeons. You think the Americans and Russians just threw that data away?</p>

<p>This is the tip of the iceberg. Much tainted knowledge has been downplayed and suppressed to lessen the ethical implications and much of it was destroyed at the end of the war. Impact data used by Volvo to design seatbelts and cars, drug experiments by Bayer, German medical scientists identified the connection between cigarette smoking and lung cancer,...go look up what a colposcopy is, who developed it and his history. Go look up how many Nazi scientists were given &quot;parole&quot; if they worked for the US military after the war. Think all that research was just forgotten or not used? Directly, indirectly, unethical Nazi human experimentation advanced science in some ways, although German science was much better without it. To think otherwise is wishful thinking and revisionist. </p>

DNA data is probably the most valuable data that any company can get from us. Maybe GPS/location data, facial recognition (Facebook&#39;s treasure trove of photos, Google Photos allowing unlimited HD uploads, etc come to kind), and maybe just meta data in general come close.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk if it&#39;s public information or not. In either case how would they find my birth certificate? </p>

<p>Finding everything about one person is not an easy thing to do with just a name. I suppose it&#39;s be easier if they had your name, address, and work address. But still I&#39;ve never once given a company I worked for or insurance company or any company my birth certificate. So they&#39;d have to find out where I was born.   In order to find out who birthed me. Now probably could be done. But not easily. And nearly efficient enough for a company to potentially deny you. It&#39;d cost them an unnecessary amount that&#39;s not worth spending.</p>

<p>Even your social security number doesn&#39;t have that information attached to it. It&#39;s only a tax id number. </p>

<p>They can certainly find a bunch of information on you if they searched enough. But to find blood relatives based off that is going to be difficult especially if your older. Impossible? No. But definitely more money and effort than they&#39;d be willing to spend just to deny you insurance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But if someone in your family has this test done and they find a gene that is likely to cause a disease, it might be one that runs in the family. Then all they need to do is find the names of their family members. So your mom is likely to get dementia, they go through her facebook and find your name. Now they charge you more for insurance because you also have an increased chance of getting dementia. They never looked at your dna, and you aren&#39;t on facebook, but they can still put that information together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really is.</p>

<p>The only case off the top of my head I imagine that may have a chance is: already insured individual gets sick/injured, but the insurance refuses coverage for care due to increased risk of adverse effects/events occurring by x/y/z (related to claimed illness/injury or not) with the required course of treatment. </p>

<p>I think as long as you’re already covered and the laws remain firm and in place, you’re “good,” plainly speaking.</p>

<p>It would be nice if these companies were more open about what it is their customers are getting into - like anything it could be used for good or bad, but the obscured transparency leans me more towards believing the latter. In reality they should be paying you for the opportunity to collect and disseminate your genetic information. Knowing your ancestral lineage and predisposition to certain ailments is just a bonus if it can be used against you ( to change insurance coverage / rates for instance ). As we progress technology so quickly it is more important than ever to consider the far reaching unintended consequences of using exciting new products and services. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/u/bleedingfromwherever">/u/bleedingfromwherever</a> is largely correct. There are for profit healthcare systems in other areas of the world that are substantially less expensive and high quality. We have regulatory capture enabling exploitation and limitations on governmental price negotiation. We&#39;ve essentially made it really shitty for the average person who essentially forfeits a larger percentage of their salary for medical purposes in an era of new expenses, inflation, and wage stagnation. The reasons to have insurance is for absolute catastrophe (e.g. a no-fault accident and two weeks in the hospital), or frequent costly drugs for disease management (diabetes, autoimmune, cancer, etc.). If you break your leg and have to hit the E.R., you&#39;re still looking at a few grand out of pocket on the average mid-tier health insurance plan, or half as much if you settle with cash and avoid the insurance company.</p>

<p>This is why the free market works, the initial bill wouldn&#39;t be nearly as bad if the market was allowed to make corrections. Hospitals that don&#39;t lower their prices, will have to justify that, or face losing business.  </p>

<p>They charge more, because insurance companies might pay it, not because they will pay it.</p>

<p>Without pharma companies lobbying for this, government would have to end the monopoly, and prices across the board would fall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i know someone deep inside the health insurance industry and he put it to me this way: creating a single-payer healthcare system would give the government so much buying power that it would dramatically drop these sorts of prices. Right now, a typical insurance company has the buying power for, say, 2 million people. Well the single-payer system would have the buying power of 200 million, so costs of bulk items that are inflating prices will go down, like the distribution of pharmaceuticals, lab equipment costs etc. And the bonus is that private insurance companies can also sell their services in a more competitive market. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not the supplies that are expensive. They normal prices, low even if bought in bulk. The issue is all the over head associated with the supplies at the hospital. Look at it this way: think about a box of nitrile gloves. They cost about $8 per a box of 100 gloves or 50 pairs. Out of that box of 50 pairs, only 40 will be used. This Jack&#39;s up the price per pair a little bit. Ok, now some one has to order the gloves for that huge hospital. They also likely monitor the stock of the gloves and order other stuff as well. That person gets paid some sort of salary so that increases the price. Someone else has to stock the boxes of gloves individually though out the facility, that also increases the price for the end consumer (aka patient). Once you&#39;ve added in the rates of all the people who contributed to getting those gloves onto the hand of the medical professional and then into the incinerators later, that $8 box of gloves becomes a $100 box of gloves, no joke. I don&#39;t work at a hospital, but something similar where what should be cheap supplies become very expensive just by virtue of the fact that we have a person ordering them, another person approving the order, a this person actually planning the order with a vender and a fourth person verifying the order was received and a fifth person dispatching the funds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never heard the supply-chain explanation for medical costs before, so that&#39;s interesting. How much does the &#39;chain of custody&#39; of &#39;hospital grade products&#39; affect prices? For example, I can go to the supermarket and spend $1.00 on 30 generic acetaminophen, while they might have to spend $20 on a box of 30 BEFORE other supply-chain costs (fake numbers, but hopefully you get my point).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This article is incredibly fair on both perspectives, but still quells your paranoia. Did you even read the whole thing?</p>

<p>They’re not hiding the fact that compensation for participating in a very profitable, virtuous research study is far less than what is typically awarded for similarly potent information received like this in past studies.   However, this is because (a) it’s hella non-invasive &amp; easy for the participant at no cost of anything (except the kit obvi, but supplies need to be paid for and this isn’t govt funded), but time and saliva; (b) this is a new type of research being done, so we don’t know whether final results are even going to statistically significant/helpful during analysis; (c) and the big-picture goal is for the benefit of every individual to be able to learn information that may or may not encourage healthier, preventive behavior, while also identifying and discovering new things in disease research that we never have and could have never known before.</p>

<p>Yet, they also agree to a point that much of the actual individual results are more or less “unhelpful” to the average participant.   This is because:</p>

<p>a) genes are complicated, easily &amp; broadly influenced, and dynamic in expression.  The test given with the kit is no longer technically accurate of your current, ACTUAL percentage of risk for “x.”   So, it’s arguably inaccurate, hence the push back from healthcare professionals on this. </p>

<p>b) Regardless if the subject gets any accurate information, it isn’t likely to be fully or well understood by the participant.  Scientists barely understand what they’re “reading” themselves sometimes.  This can either cause undue stress to the participant (which they warn of). </p>

<p>c) Read point B above again, but in the context of insurance companies evaluating the report of individual results.  Again, not accurate, and -duh- we’re all likely to get sick and die of SOMETHING. This is just an avenue to satisfy our self obsession by finding out WHAT (might).   That’s also why there’s those dumb results of earwax composition.  We’re all absolutely enamored with ANY information about ourselves or how it relates to us.</p>

<p>You’re not telling anyone (that has an idea), anything new. Just creating possible but unlikely scenarios in your head. Just like you would if you got your results and read that you’re 30% more likely than others to develop Alzheimer’s. Yeah, risk is there but again, not even likely lol</p>

<p>Another awesome counterpoint to this paranoia is that healthcare professionals suggest that this could end not having universal healthcare.   Insurance companies have a deep love-hate relationship with these tests and results, as it can change healthcare all together, which they systemically depend on.   In fact, they depend on you NOT knowing better.   You end up costing them profits because you were able decrease the perceived coverage needed, due to (possibly) being healthier/less likely to cost them a lot to care for.</p>

<p>This leads me to the next huge point that our healthcare system is based on treatment and not prevention.   Look up statistics on % of people in developed nations with illnesses they could have never gotten to start with, and how much it costs society.   Just look at the price of obesity on America.   Think about the astronomic numeric pricetag it has, and then think of the unsaid price (personal and societal) of most of the population not being at optimal health, despite being in the most medically advanced nations.   I won’t continue on that because if you’re not picking up what I’m putting down, you just don’t get it yet.</p>

<p>Save your self-obsession for your health. It’s also highly likely the government/companies don’t actually care that you’re 3% black and will probably die of heart disease (newsflash: most do). It’s not that deep lol</p>

<p>What is studied is just a snapshot of your genes at the time of spitting, compared to the answers you gave to the medical questionnaire, compared to the “snapshots” of others and their answers.   Hopefully, a statistically significant pattern of factors related to Disease X would be identified, and “at risk” (remember, they may not be “as” at risk compared to when they spit) participants could find out about these newly found factors to further help them maintain their health.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. My son&#39;s friends have all taken these tests and I&#39;ve urged them to use caution. It&#39;s just signing yourself up for a lifetime of harassment from marketers at best and Minority Report style monitoring at worst. They can&#39;t do a lot with the DNA yet in terms of how much they can glean from the sample, but of course ID is an easy one. Commit a crime anywhere (or get framed for one) with DNA already on record.</p>

<p>Further - what if they identify a genetic sequence that makes people &quot;rebellious&quot; - oh well we found you in this database! I know there are so many promising use-cases for this stuff, but we gotta be careful in giving what little power we have left to corporations of gov&#39;ts (which are increasingly the same damn thing).</p>

<p>As someone who has worked in a genetics lab... we can do a lot. And I was working on a species that doesn&#39;t even have its full genome mapped out yet like we&#39;ve done for humans. I can only imagine the work being done behind closed doors in for profit companies handling all this data. </p>

<p>Next gen sequencing is already extremely cheap, quick, and efficient with the ability to sequence a person&#39;s entire for under $100 on the way <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/10/illumina-wants-to-sequence-your-whole-genome-for-100/">within the next couple of years</a>. Idk what setup 23&amp;me has though. The biggest reason for inaccuracies is a lack of data. As more and more people send in their data the more clearer of a picture these companies can get on an epidemiological scale. </p>

<p>Historically it has been upper middle class white folk who have sent in samples. A few of the comments here are claiming that these companies have sent kits to entire neighborhoods in an effort to get them to use their service. If true, I&#39;d wager the neighborhoods that had the kits sent to were places filled with minorities that they have little data on. </p>

<p>That&#39;s where it is though. Things change, governments change. The things that become the province of the government also change, as well they should. This is the reason we have government (in whichever form) and not anarchy. As society changes, so too does the role the government takes.</p>

And it isn&#39;t like they are &#39;buying&#39; the data off of the DNA collection agencies. They can request health data which that information is a part of. They can ask you if you have submitted a DNA test before and if you lie they can deny your plan. That certainly is a bit troubling, but not in the way you are depicting it.

<p>This is highly misleading. The article only comments on the possibility of this happening in future, it doesn&#39;t say anything about them selling data to insurance companies today nor does it imply they are currently planning to do that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well a couple of the reasons beyond general curiosity I think would involve scenarios like these: 1. A person is a sperm donor baby so they only know half of their genetic ancestry or what cultures they came from. 2. A person is adopted and doesn’t know hardly anything about where they come from. 3. An African American wants to find out where they came from because they don’t have records for their ancestry beyond slavery.</p>

<p>One of these things affects me so I’ve always been curious to try a 23 and Me. However, I’m very glad I haven’t done it because I definitely won’t now. I think number 3 is one of the reasons that has roots beyond just curiosity, but all 3 situations could prevent you from understanding genetic predispositions. I don’t know how much knowing these things truly matters though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They could easily sell those kits in any grocery store, but they don&#39;t for this very reason. Another good point is the pricing, $99 is just &#39;cheap&#39; enough for anyone to be able to afford it but too expensive for people to tinker around with it or send a bunch of bogus samples to obfuscate their own data. The process is so easy and cheap an associate lab assistant could handle a few dozen samples an hour. The only thing you are paying for is their vast amount of data which is data mined to link your genetic profile to their estimation model.</p>

<p>The same set of data that is worth far, far more than the measly $99 when sold to insurance companies, advertisement agencies, research bureaus and governments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s a little weird that the CEO of 23and Me, Anne Wojcicki, is the sister of the CEO of Youtube, Susan Wojcicki - where these DNA sites are constantly being propped up with sponsored videos and advertisements. Anne is also the ex-wife of Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google, and current president of Google&#39;s parent company, Alphabet Inc. Google Ventures, the investment arm of Google, financially backs 23andMe. The CEO of Google Ventures is Bill Maris, who is also the founder of Calico, a company whose focus is to &quot;harness advanced technologies to increase our understanding of the biology that controls lifespan.&quot; Wikipedia says their goal is to combat aging and associated diseases. Soooo immortality. But its already been determined that overpopulation is a problem, and we are depleting the earths resources...so who gets to decide who lives forever? Who gets to reproduce? </p>

<p>Good thing 23andMe has the worlds biggest DNA depositary to weed out those with inferior DNA!  23andMe advertises testing for over 256 genetically inherited diseases and conditions. Did you know in the last few years there have been 500 genes discovered that could determine intelligence? 23 and Me is collecting that data, but has decided to not inform the public of their brain ratings, concerned the information would not be well received. Let&#39;s not forget about 23andMe&#39;s designer baby patent. They offer screenings of genomes for inherited traits like height and  eye color in their &quot;Family Traits Inheritance Calculator&quot;. </p>

<p>Companies like Google are collecting all of our data,  including the most unique thing about us, our genetic code,  and selling that data to undisclosed third party companies. These DNA companies are also now providing Familial DNA to the police to solve cases like the alleged Golden State Killer, as well as discovering the identities of Jane/John Does like the Buckskin Girl and Lyle Stevik. Will these companies use this new knowledge and monetization of the human genome for strictly benevolent reasons? All I see is a modern day eugenics program. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you’re saying (most of me wouldn’t be surprised), but I also see an entire community of people actually doing this work and believing in the benefits of the research.   Dedicating their lives to it.  Surely someone there has half a brain to not let all the money in the world sway their work.  The CEO? Idk, probably not likely if I’m being real, but definitely someone who could both a) know what is happening to the data and b) knows how to destroy it. Also I don’t find it all that surprising. CEOs don’t have to know the nitty gritty of their product, just business. Which runs in families and friends.</p>

<p>The benefits are definitely there though  -  eg. using a medication suggested most functional for your sequence, aka “getting the ‘right’ med” the first time.  It’d be based on data scores on how other {still nameless} people reacted to treatments w/ similar sequences to you.  </p>

<p>Rather than waiting to see results from every different med they have to swallow to see effect in their illness(es) and have lower quality of life, people will be healthier and therefore more productive and of benefit to society. Prevention is absolutely key in healthcare.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get the connection you&#39;re trying to make here. Are you saying Calico would choose not to provide their anti aging treatments to those with inferior DNA? Why would they need to collect the data in secret if that&#39;s the case? Why not just require a DNA test before offering their services? Furthermore how does that even benefit them from a profit standpoint?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not true. They sold the data to one company (GSK) and they publically disclosed it (and gave an option to opt out).</p>

<p>No.  In fact I&#39;d like to see anonymous data from every human being along with their symptoms and disease diagnosis all combined into a huge database.   Then that database could be used to help diagnose and cure diseases.   The key however would be a) true anonimization and b) legal prohibitions against using any DNA data that is somehow matched to a particular person so people are protected against insurance company bull shit etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Long time before all those Mormon&#39;s genes test sites like Ancestry.com, when you came to doctors visit, you filled up a form, where you self have to listed, all illnesses which you was sick. You family, your parents medical problems etc.  Remember it? And you think this information ever was inaccessible for the Big Insurance or somebody else?
Hah. Bush&#39;s in his &quot;The Patriot Act&quot; gave access to all of our medical records to ... whom? We don&#39;t fucking even know it! Because this information illegally sealed from us! Obama prolonged this anti-constitutional act, and Trump it did too!</p>

<p>So, you genes can tell to insurers just about your super major medical problems like imbecility, idiotism etc.
But(!) your medical records will tell everything about your health. And they sold already long time ago. Thank you GOP and Mr. Bush.</p>

<p>However i do think that in the longterm you are required to give your DNA otherwise you wont get insurance. So it is only a temporary relief, since if they really want the data they will force the feds to collect it.

<p>Another fear I have is someone using the database in the future to judge/detain people based on ethnicity/ancestry. Think of what the Holocaust would have been like had Hitler had DNA tests like this. </p>

<p>Now think of what it will be like in 10 years, when another group is demonized the way, say, Muslims are. Yes, I know, it&#39;s a religion, but most Muslims come from Arab countries. So the Gov uses these tests to target anyone with a certain percentage of Arab DNA. Doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re a proud, red blooded American patriot. You have 40 to 60% Arab DNA, so you&#39;re guilty by association and sent to WWII style camps the way the Japanese were. They could do this with anyone of any ethnicity/ancestry as long as that ancestry lines up with a group the Gov has targeted/demonized. </p>

<p>Maybe, but that doesn&#39;t prove or even loosely imply that they are trying to &quot;build the most powerful database in the history of mankind. A complete DNA database with matching names and addresses.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You realize when you send in that DNA they have no ability to actually identify you right? Like I bought a kit, spit in a tube and wrote my name on a piece of paper. I could have written any name I wanted, and besides that there are probably millions of people with my same name. There&#39;s no way they can use your anonymously given DNA against you for health insurance reasons etc... Furthermore, if there was any conspiracy to get peoples DNA it can easily be obtained any time you go to the Dr. </p>

<p>Sure, they are going to use the DNA databases to make as much money as they can. That is understandable since they are corporations looking to make a profit. </p>
