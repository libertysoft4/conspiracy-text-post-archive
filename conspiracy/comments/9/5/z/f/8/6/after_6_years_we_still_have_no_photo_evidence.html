<p>Turns out ..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The head of the CIA admitted yesterday that there was no live video footage of the raid on Osama bin Laden&#39;s compound as further doubts emerged about the US version of events. </p>

<p>A photograph released by the White House appeared to show President Barack Obama and his aides in the situation room watching the action as it unfolded. In fact they had little knowledge of what was happening in the compound. </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t want the &#39;leaders of the free world&#39; to be watching possible war crimes being committed, so they cut the feed (imo).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why not? They confirmed it was him by DNA and then they buried him quickly, according to Islamic requirements. As with the initial burials of Hitler, Goebbels, and Guevara, they didn&#39;t want to bury him somewhere known, so that it could become a site for supporters. I also seem to remember that there were issues about which countries would have been willing to accept the body.</p>

<p>What do you think they should have done with the body? Put it on display somewhere?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of those citations confirms that Bin Laden was dead. Most of them simply have him reported to be suffering from renal failure. Others, like the one that is described as &quot;October 2002: Intelligence Officials Confirm bin Laden is Dead&quot; actually just state that he appeared to be dead.</p>

<p>I find it funny how the mainstream media is generally derided in this sub as being fake news, unless an article lends (even vague) support to a conspiracy theory, in which case the story is unimpeachable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. He probably died during operation anaconda. There is almost no chance he survived that onslaught of bombings and raids because they were actually hot on his trail and he required  constant dialysis. I would assume that the military leaders who were involved in this operation were not privy to the charade and anyone who knew about bin laden steal death was debriefed and warned that that information is now classified. The whole bin laden raid was a Hollywood theatric just like the moon landing </p>

<p>That&#39;s begging the question – you have no evidence that it was a distraction.</p>

<p>Besides, when the Bolivians killed Che Guevara, they did put his body on display for a short while, but only in a small village and only for a short while. They then buried him in an unmarked grave. The US wanted Guevara dead, but they didn&#39;t go all out to photograph the body and &quot;parade&quot; it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean it was reported by MSM on multiple occasions in the early 00&#39;s. He was going through kidney failure and was somehow surviving in the remote mountains of Afghanistan. On top of that theres been proof of fuckery with &quot;his videos&quot; that came out at the time. Not to mention no pictures whatsoever when we supposedly killed him. And then we just buried him at sea with no other proof just because that&#39;s what he would have wanted? Haha come on</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bin Laden died in 2001.  He made a convenient scapegoat because he wasn&#39;t around to refute Anerican propaganda, but people were getting bored of him in the villain role after many years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need some &quot;photo evidence&quot;? Oh, man. Did you ever heard about Photoshop program? Sure, you did. So, what kind of photo you need? I&#39;ll do it for you right now ;)</p>

<p>But, if seriously, there in Osama house was some platoon of marines, as I remember. I don&#39;t want to think about them, they all plain liers. But, You free to think whatever you want. Don&#39;t forget there was whole family of Bin Laden too. And they never said their husband and father still alive or something like this. All Arabs in the word believes Osama Bin Laden is dead. So, don&#39;t build conspiracy on empty place.</p>

<p>But. If Osama was a really serious man, he would left some good kompomat on CIA or whoever made 9/11.
So far we don&#39;t have nothing from him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bin Laden, shot and disposed of even though he’d been reported as probably dead for years, right when Obama needed a foreign policy win during the build up to reelection.
It was dubious at best from the first headline.
Then all the SEALs die 🤣🤣😂🤣
Nothing to see here, move along...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding is that they didn&#39;t want emotionally-charged citizens plastering photos of Bin Laden&#39;s dead body everywhere/online, out of concern that it would provoke further attacks against the United States. ...And knowing Americans, they would flaunt that photo every chance they had.  </p>

<p>If Bin Laden died years earlier, there would have been photos that surfaced.  The fact there are no photos leads credence to the official story, IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The SEAL who killed him and wrote a book actually had an illegal photo of the body. The operator had to return that photo as well as 6.7 million in profits from the book he wrote with out the pentagons clearance. There are photos we just won’t see them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The timing was sketchy, Obama announced his bid for re-election a month earlier, and the negative press about the Libya conflict and all the drones he was using that year was going on. Bin Laden is definitely dead though as there’s no more propaganda by him and all the media attention is focused on his surving son Hamza. There probably was a lesson after publishing Saddam’s hanging as it made him out to be a martyr when he was carrying the Quran and reciting passages.  </p>
