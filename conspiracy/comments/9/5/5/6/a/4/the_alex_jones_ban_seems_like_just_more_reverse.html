<p>This move seems like a staged event, to make him appear persecuted or male him appear as if he’s truly a threat to the establishment, which is not the case in my opinion. </p>

<p>This not only gives him free publicity, but it makes his supporters and listeners latch onto him even more, making him more of a thorn in the side of real Truth seekers. </p>

<p>I don’t think so, because no matter what party is “in power”, the ruling class still maintains control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that&#39;s a little too simplistic of a viewpoint. There is a ruling class that agrees on things like keeping the wars going, but they have definite disagreements as well. It might be good to consider whether Alex Jones is protected by one wing of the ruling class and being taken down by another wing.</p>

<p>You can see that with some of his limited hangouts. Why is he always talking about a mid-level player like Soros? Because Soros isn&#39;t powerful enough to take Jones out, and Jones&#39; handlers want to hurt him.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, there are members of the ruling class that actually have benevolent intentions (Kennedy, Reagan) and are able to get into positions of power. This explains why members of the ruling class killed Kennedy and tried to kill Reagan.</p>

Same goes for the NYT lady with her Twitter, to me it feels like that was brought up on purpose to incite rage and anger (best form of mind control) and wanted to get people to attack her for what she said in those tweets.

    <div class="md"><p>You are right. Also, by this point, anyone who hasn’t heard of Alex Jones, and needs the help of such “platforms” to find him, is not a variable in any political equation. Nonetheless I expect him to be reinstated following “outrage from the Internet” (or whatever similar catchphrase).</p>

<p>I find the fact that AJ is a shill to be <em>very good news</em>. Effective lies must be packaged in a box of truth. And Alex Jones has been good during (much of) the Obama presidency: true libertarian, anti-war, telling many truths, etc.</p>

<p>The way I see it is that if the central planners are ready to pay such a price, to spell out so many (half-)truths, to (half-)wake so many people (which is risky because they can finish waking up on their own), <strong>it can only mean they are desperate</strong>. They fear the free-flow of information that’s become possible, and indeed they should.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought this too, but the only problem is that AJ has enlightened many many people on issues that are not public knowledge and that the MSM won&#39;t touch. My response when someone asks me if I think he&#39;s &quot;controlled opposition&quot; or &quot;honest&quot; is that he&#39;s both. He&#39;s allowed to do what he does as long as he doesn&#39;t talk about certain things or have a particular slant on certain topics. I&#39;ve seen his older clips where he speaks much more freely; I&#39;ve seen him have to do public apologies and take down videos because they were too close to truths TPTB need to keep out of the spotlight. I don&#39;t think they want to draw more attention to him than he already has.</p>

<p>So, they allow him to exist and keep him in a defined cage, and I think the motive is that he&#39;s a good dipstick for their opposition and how many people are dissatisfied enough with the official narrative of anything to seek him out. </p>

<p>I feel like he must have become too much of a liability somehow, rather than this being reverse psychology to draw attention to him. They&#39;re wanting to control the narrative even more, and it would be easier to make him disappear, and they can&#39;t kill him because it would be too obvious. </p>

<p>I also feel like your angle is just as possible and valid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Precisely what I’m thinking. My buddy texted me about Hicks having been banned and I said “I don’t quite buy it” or something. And he was like yes he did, he got banned from all social media, I just saw it. I had to tell him, no I mean I don’t <em>buy it,</em> as in it seems like a show. InfoWars has touched on some heavy topics but they actually fall short of even being politically incorrect. They’re like the “liberals are the real racists/Nazis/murderers” with a little conspiracy theories sprinkled in. But they miss the mark often with the theories they do cover, Sandy Hook being an obvious example. Hicks is known as the “Sandy Hook guy” but he takes such an ignorant and evasive stance on it, saying children actually died etc. </p>

As looney as Alex acts I don’t think it benefits TPTB for him to spread the info that he does, and now to become some sort of Martyr. I think at first they thought his “craziness” would give conspiracy theorists a bad name, but I think it ended up backfiring as he ended up Red-pilling more people than they expected and now they are reacting. </p>

<p>making him more of a thorn in the side of real Truth seekers</p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly how I see it. I see zero reason to support a guy that discredits us by turning every single controversy into a shitty money grabbing attention-seeking shit-show.</p>

<p>The only reason he exists is to make people who question the &quot;official narrative&quot; seem as crazy as he is (or acts). Giving him more publicity is just reinforcing that &quot;all crazies&quot; narrative in the minds of the average person.</p>
