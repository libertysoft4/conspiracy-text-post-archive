<p>Zionist Israel wants to establish itself as the single ruling power in all of the middle east. Number one, they are not strong enough to do it by themselves, and number two, they need someone to take the blame. Enter the UNITED STATES INC.</p>

<p>The author will chronologically line up important dates and quotes from key leaders to prove that Zionist Israel is depleting the USA of it&#39;s resources and killing our citizens for their gain.</p>

<p>First a quote from none other than President George Washington. Even back during the 18th century, our founding fathers knew it was paramount to not let other nations meddle in our business. This is proof they still taught world history back then. </p>

<p>1796- George Washington said;</p>

<p>&quot;history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government&quot;.</p>

<p>World War I and the Zionist connection.</p>

<p>In 1914 the Zionists knew they needed the USA in WWI to help with the creation of a Zionist Israel. They made an agreement with the British to stage a false flag event with the help of Woodrow Wilson to bring America into the war. The American public wanted no part of a war. We were an isolationist nation at the time. We took heed of Washington&#39;s statement above. But that all changed.</p>

<p>May 1915- Quite possibly the first official false flag for America, the sinking of the <a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/lusitania-sinks">Lusitania</a>. The British passenger ship was sunk by the German&#39;s when it was purposefully guided into a war zone unattended by British escort. The Germans gave fair warning not to sail into these waters but they did it anyway. 1198 people died including 128 American&#39;s.</p>

<p>1916- Rothschild&#39;s team draws up proposal for the Mandate of Palestine;</p>

<p>This is the same group of people that created the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. The proposal was submitted in 1919 by the Zionist Organization at the Paris Peace Conference. The proposal would set the tone for the illegal settlement of Israel in Palestine.</p>

<p>April 6th, 1917- President Woodrow Wilson finally declares war on Germany;</p>

<p>It took a while but by using propaganda fueled by mainstream media over the Lusitania incident, Wilson finally declares war with the full weight of America behind him.</p>

<p>November 2nd, 1917- Lord Balfour makes his promise of Israel to Walter Rothschild;</p>

<p>With America in the war, the written Balfour Declaration officially offers Palestine as a national home for the Jews. At this time only 5% of Palestine was Jewish and most did not support the Zionist agenda stated in the previous Mandate. The text of the declaration was published in the press on November 9th in England.</p>

<p>An interesting note;</p>

<p>Besides the Rothschilds, other international bankers were interested in securing control of the area as well. Turns out 5T$ worth of minerals and oil had been discovered in Palestine by a consulting geologist to the British government, his name, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hubert_Cunningham_Craig">Edward Hubert Cunningham Craig</a>. These geological reports were kept secret.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that since 722BC, this area had not been called Israel.</p>

<p>The death of 128 American lives is all it took in those days to justify the bloodiest and most cruel war in world history. 4.7 million American men served in WWI. We lost 116,516 soldiers with approximately 320,000 sick and wounded. Total death toll to allies, opposition, military and civilians are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_casualties">41 million</a> souls lost.</p>

<p>The story goes as follows-</p>

<p>Political Zionist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Brandeis">Louis Brandeis</a> sends a delegation from America to Britain to promise to bring America into the war on the side of the British, provided the British agree to give the land of Palestine to the Rothschild&#39;s. The Rothschild&#39;s wanted Palestine because they had great business interests in the far east and desired their own state in that area along with their own military which they could use as an aggressor to any state that threatened those interests. As it turned out the Dead Sea itself was worth trillion$ in natural resources. The agreement is made.</p>

<p>1915- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMahon%E2%80%93Hussein_Correspondence">Sir H. McMahon</a> fictitiously promises Palestine to the Arabs if they agree to conquer the Ottoman Empire. The Arabs agreed and they followed through.</p>

<p>June 5th 1916- While the Arabs are at war with the Turks, the British, under the command of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Allenby,_1st_Viscount_Allenby">General Allenby</a> march into Jerusalem. The British move in and take over Palestine for the Zionists, not the Arabs.</p>

<p>November 2nd 1917- With Palestine under British control, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Balfour">Lord Balfour</a> formally promises Palestine to Jews in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration">Balfour Declaration</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Rothschild%2C_2nd_Baron_Rothschild">Lord Walter Rothschild</a>.</p>

<p>The British had deceived the Arabs in a coup d&#39;etat that rendered Europe an extinguished Ottoman Empire and a conquered Palestine for the Zionists.</p>

<p>Is it no wonder there is political and social unrest in the middle east? Here is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_modern_conflicts_in_the_Middle_East">list of wars</a> fought in the middle east. Notice the explosion of conflict starting at the close of WWI. This is Zionism fighting for hegemony of the Middle East. It continues today.</p>

<p>During the next 30 years there would be much tension between Arab&#39;s and Zionist Jews, for good reason.</p>

<p>1920- the creation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Mandate_of_Palestine">British Mandate of Palestine</a> upset both Jews and Arabs escalating into relentless turmoil.</p>

<p>The proposal in 1916 is now law in the eyes of the Zionists. Palestine belongs to the Jews and the war on terror begins. A new design of terrorism was formulated and the world would never be the same.</p>

<p>December 7th, 1941- Pearl Harbor false flag attack brings America into WW2;</p>

<p>Yes, FDR was a Zionist. He was a traitor to America for 12 years. To perpetuate the Pearl Harbor onslaught, FDR positioned the naval fleet around HI just so, making it easier for Japan to destroy and harder for USA to defend. Japan was instructed by the Zionists where and when to attack. FDR was then informed and he followed directions like the obedient puppet he was recruited for. (<em>For more info on this read the book My Exploited Father-in-Law by Curtis B. Dall</em>)</p>

<p>In 1789 Benjamin Franklin said this;</p>

<p>&quot;If they are not excluded from the United States by the Constitution, within less than 100 years, they will stream into this country in such numbers they will rule and destroy us and change our form of government for which we Americans shed our blood and sacrificed life, property and personal freedom&quot;. <em>He was right on the money.</em></p>

<p>November 29th, 1947- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine">United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine</a>;</p>

<p>The ongoing tension between the Arab&#39;s and the Zionists finally erupt into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947%E2%80%931948_Civil_War_in_Mandatory_Palestine">civil war</a> following the adoption of the UN PPP, which planned to divide Palestine into three areas: an Arab state, a Jewish state and the Special International Regime for the cities of Jerusalem and Bethlehem.</p>

<p>Up to WWII the Zionists promote Israel as the new home of the Jews. It turned out that most Jews did not agree with the progressive views of the Zionists.</p>

<p>Reuter- August 16 1947 &quot;The Kingdom of Israel (Greater Israel) map allegedly found by the Germans in a Rothschild house during the war, was stated to show a kingdom stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates&quot;.</p>

<p>May 14th 1948- Israel, with the help of FDR and the UNITED STATES, Israel  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Declaration_of_Independence">becomes a nation</a>. The Zionists win and Palestine is now officially the home of the Zionist&#39;s. Since then, occupied Palestine has grown exponentially while the Zionist&#39;s displace millions of Arabs.</p>

<p>The net result of WW2 declared Israel a nation. It also poured 40B$ of profit into the pocket of the Federal Reserve shareholders (Zionists). The international bankers made out on both ends as usual.</p>

<p>July 2 thru July 27, 1954 - The Lavon Affair</p>

<p>Israeli terrorist bomb U.S. and British civilian targets in Egypt. Not until 2005, did Israel finally admit responsibility for this false-flag terrorist bombing campaign. The false-flag terror bombings were carried out by a covert terror cell composed of about one dozen Egyptian Jews under the command of Israeli intelligence agents, Mossad. They blamed the killing spree on the Egyptians to incite American discontent.</p>

<p>This excerpt from Christopher Bollyn&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Solving-9-11-Deception-Changed-World/dp/0985322586">Solving 9-11</a>;</p>

<p>The Lavon Affair, or &quot;the shameful affair&quot; (Esek Habish) as it is known in Hebrew, was an Israeli false-flag terror bombing campaign against the United States and Britain that was carried out in Egypt in 1954. Israeli military intelligence had set up a terror cell of sleeper agents in Egypt, which was activated in July 1954 to blow up U.S. and British targets. The Israeli operation was code-named &quot;Susannah.&quot; The false-flag terrorist bombings were meant to be blamed on Egyptians in order to alienate the U.S. and Britain from President Gamal Abdul Nasser and prevent Egypt from nationalizing the Suez Canal. Israeli terrorist cell, Unit 131, was reportedly responsible for the terror bombings.</p>

<p>This was all just another chapter in the story to create Greater Israel.</p>

<p>October 29th, 1956- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Crisis">Israeli Suez War</a>;</p>

<p>In the Knesset former Prime Minister <a href="http://www.thehypertexts.com/Israeli%20Prime%20Ministers%20Terrorists%20Nakba.htm">Ben Gurion</a> announced his political and military reasons for Israel initiating the war, being for the restoration of the Kingdom of David and Solomon to its Biblical [Old Testament] borders. The Biblical borders of the land of Israel, which rabbinical authorities interpret as ideally belonging to the Jewish state. Included are the following areas: in the south, all of Sinai and a part of northern Egypt up to the environs of Cairo; in the east, all of Jordon and a large chunk of Saudi Arabia, all of Kuwait and a part of Iraq south of the Euphrates; in the north, all of Lebanon and all of Syria together with a huge part of Turkey (up to Lake Van); and in the west, Cyprus.</p>

<p>Although the US didn&#39;t have much more than political involvement in this war, the Lavon Affair obviously took it&#39;s toll.</p>

<p>June 8th 1967, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War">Israeli/Syrian 6 Day War</a>;</p>

<p>In order to get the UNITED STATES involved, Israel bombs the USS Liberty with complicity from then sitting US President Lyndon B. Johnson who states &quot;I want that ship on the bottom&quot;. This false flag attack which is formulated to look like an attack by Syria, brings the UNITED STATES INC into the war.</p>

<p>The Israeli&#39;s attacked the USS Liberty with French advanced Dassault Mirage III jet fighters that killed 34 U.S. servicemen and wounded 171.</p>

<p>&quot;The (Israeli) ground control station ordered the aircraft to attack and sink the target and ensure they left no survivors,&quot; Steve Forslund, a former USAF intelligence analyst told the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>.</p>

<p>One of the objectives of this war was to steal the Golan Heights from Syria which would  provided Israel with fresh water. This is a pretty good indication that fresh water was far more precious to them than oil reserves.</p>

<p>Lt. James M. Ennes, Jr., an officer on the bridge of the USS Liberty, wrote his first-hand account of the Israeli attack in a 1979 book entitled <em>Assault on the Liberty</em>. Lieutenant Ennes&#39; book is documentary evidence that the Israeli attack was deliberate and not an accident of war. Ennes describes how Israeli torpedo boats repeatedly machine-gunned Liberty sailors fighting the napalm fires on deck and shot her life rafts in the water while an oversize U.S. flag flew from its mast.</p>

<p>&quot;U.S. intelligence documents indicate the Israelis attacked the Liberty deliberately. They feared she would monitor their plans to attack the Golan Heights in Syria - a move the United States opposed for fear of provoking Soviet military intervention,&quot; James Ennes said.</p>

<p>Steve Forslund, an intelligence analyst for the 544th Air Reconnaissance Technical Wing in 1967, saw the transcripts from the Israeli pilots and their ground control as they came off the teletype machine at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha. &quot;The ground control station stated that the target was American and for the aircraft to confirm it,&quot; Forslund recalled. &quot;The aircraft did confirm the identity of the target as American, by the American flag. The ground control station ordered the aircraft to attack and sink the target and ensure they left no survivors.&quot; Forslund said he clearly recalled &quot;the obvious frustration of the controller over the inability of the pilots to sink the target quickly and completely.&quot; &quot;He kept insisting the mission had to sink the target, and was frustrated with the pilots&#39; responses that it didn&#39;t sink.&quot;</p>

<p>Remembering LBJ&#39;s demand; &quot;I want that ship on the bottom&quot;.</p>

<p>Chief Petty Officer Stanley W. White, president of the Liberty Veterans Association, said, &quot;The Israeli planes and gunboats spent more than one hour hitting us with rockets, napalm bombs, torpedoes, cannon and machine-gun fire. They machine-gunned our firefighters on deck and they shot our life rafts out of the water…I don&#39;t know of a single member of our association who believes that attack was an accident.&quot;</p>

<p>The fact that Israeli political leadership and military command decided to launch a vicious attack on an unarmed, defenseless U.S. reconnaissance ship off the coast of Gaza and kill every man on board illustrates that the Israelis are fully capable of committing such atrocities in their attempts to blame their enemies and achieve their strategic goals. - Solving 9-11</p>

<p>Lyndon B. Johnson; &quot;I want that ship on the bottom&quot;, <em>get us into that war so we can give the Golan heights to these Israeli bastards</em>-<em>I don&#39;t care how many American service men die as long as we achieve our objective for &quot;Greater Israel&quot;.</em></p>

<p>November 22nd 1967, UN Resolution 242</p>

<p>Unanimously adopted, R242 specifies the withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from occupied territories. These include the Golan Heights, Gaza, the Sinai, and the West Bank, including Jerusalem. It doesn&#39;t happen. The Zionists ignore the resolution and are not punished for it. LBJ sits back in his easy chair and grins.</p>

<p>Enter the 1980&#39;s. A new form of terrorism has taken hold and suicide bombings are now a common occurrence.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> calls for a global &quot;War on Terror&quot;. Only thing is, Bibi is the terrorist, and with the help of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehud_Olmert">Ehud Olmert</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Sharon">Ariel Sharon</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Peres">Shimon Peres</a>, they will commit bloodthirsty acts of Israeli born terrorism against America and blame it on the Arabs.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of these men was to create US animosity toward the Arab world, Muslims in particular, in order to create &quot;Greater Israel&quot;. The Zionist&#39;s called it the &quot;War on Terror&quot;.</p>

<p>At this time, Iraq was the most powerful and advanced Arab nation. The destruction of Saddam Hussein&#39;s army was all just part of the <a href="https://www.tttruth.com/demand-congress-cut-ties-with-the-zionists/">Greater Israeli</a> plan but they didn&#39;t have the manpower. So, again, they needed to enlist the US military. But how to do it?</p>

<p>October 23rd, 1983- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Beirut_barracks_bombings">The Beirut bombing</a> of the US Marine barracks;</p>

<p>241 U.S. Marines died when a Mercedes truck packed with explosives demolished their barracks at Beirut International Airport.</p>

<p>According to Victor Ostrovsky in his book on the Mossad, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Way-Deception-Making-Mossad-officer/dp/0971759502"><em>By Way of Deception</em></a>;</p>

<p>In the wake of the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, President Ronald Reagan sent 1,800 marines to Beirut to act as &quot;peace keepers.&quot; Ariel Sharon and the Israeli leadership, however, resented the interference and used the U.S. presence to commit a false-flag operation that killed 241 Marines.</p>

<p>The purpose of the false flag terror bombings in Lebanon was to create U.S. animosity toward the Arab world and align the U.S. with Israel. There had been an earlier car bomb at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut on April 18, 1983, which had killed seventeen Marines. The bombing compelled the Marines to move offshore and President Reagan ordered them to be withdrawn from Lebanon on February 7, 1984.</p>

<p>The following, events leading up to the 9-11 false flag attack on NY City.</p>

<p>May 1993- Ariel Sharon formally proposed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likud">Likud</a> Convention that Israel should adopt the Biblical borders concept as its official policy as stated in 1956 by Ben Gurion.</p>

<p>In 1999 Israel&#39;s Environment Minister, Dalia Itzik, <a href="http://www.hebroots.org/hebrootsarchive/9911/991126_b.html">declared</a> a state of emergency concerning the country&#39;s water supply.</p>

<p>Now more than ever the Zionists need the help of the US.</p>

<p>September 11, 2001- The 9/11 false flag attack on Ney York City USA.</p>

<p>Israeli forces mastermind an attack on the World Trade Center towers USA. G.W. Bush declares national emergency- <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=61760">Proclamation 7463</a> of September 14, 2001. Israel brings the UNITED STATES INC into it&#39;s war against Afghanistan and Iraq. It&#39;s running out of water. George W. Bush announced the War on Terror on September 20, 2001, in a speech to Congress. &quot;Our war on terror begins with al-Qaida, but it does not end there. It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped, and defeated.&quot; <em>Here we are 2018 and the war still drags on adding $2 trillion to the US bottom line.</em></p>

<p>Of the 9/11 attack, during a conference at Bar-Ilan University Bi Bi stated; &quot;We are benefiting from one thing, and that is the attack on the Twin Towers and Pentagon, and the American struggle in Iraq,&quot; - &quot;swung American public opinion in our favor.&quot;</p>

<p>Directly after 9-11, Israel immediately escalated the Israeli/Palestinian conflict in the West Bank and Gaza.</p>

<p>Ariel Sharon and Shimon Peres, who both have long histories of terrorism, headed the Israeli government in 2001-2002</p>

<p>To this day, not one of the alleged hijackers, masterminds, their family or friends have ever been questioned, interrogated or charged with crimes related to 9-11. There was never and official charge against Osama Bin-Ladin, ever.</p>

<p>The Zionists got their wish, US INC was in Iraq. 17 years later, <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/war-on-terror-facts-costs-timeline-3306300">over 2T$</a> of American taxpayers money wasted and millions of lives lost, the war has not ended. Israel stands to gain everything at the expense of American and Arab blood and money.</p>

<p>The extent of Zionist control over the US Inc mass media, including the Internet, has effectively prevented most people from understanding who is really behind the false flag terror attacks of 9-11.</p>

<p>September 2016- The United States and Israeli governments signed a new 10 year <a href="https://ifamericaknew.org/stat/usaid.html#source">Memorandum of Understanding</a> where the UNITED STATES INC pledged to give Israel <a href="https://ifamericaknew.org/stat/38billion.html">$38 billion</a> in military aid over the course of 10 years (FY2019 to FY2028). This new MOU replaces the current $30 billion 10-year agreement signed by the Bush Administration that will expire in 2018.</p>

<p>December 6th, 2017- President Donald Trump recognized the holy city of Jerusalem as the eternal capital of the State of Israel. He signed his name and our nation to the declaration. More power to &quot;Greater Israel&quot;.</p>

<p>July 19th, 2018- Israeli parliament proclaims Nation-State law;</p>

<p>The basic law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israel-passes-controversial-nation-state-bill-1.6291048">approved by the Knesset on July 19</a> affirmed that only Jews have the right to self-determination in Israel. It also downgraded Arabic to a language with “special status,” among several other controversial measures that affect the Israeli Druze.</p>

<p>The nation-state law is designed to alter the application of the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Liberty in court rulings, and permits judges to give priority to Israel’s Jewish character in their rulings. Accordingly, the State of Israel is the national state of the Jews only.</p>

<p>Israel&#39;s most giving philanthropist, Dame Vivien Duffield, says in a rare interview with Haaretz;</p>

<p>“Do I like Israel at the moment? No, I hate Israel. I think it’s a strong word, but I disapprove of everything. The vote in parliament [for the nation-state law] was appalling, absolutely terrible. It’s apartheid! You see, for the English, who remember South Africa, this is South Africa! This is one rule for one group and another rule for the other&quot;.</p>

<p>Her full interview <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/amp/israel-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-dame-vivien-duffield-a-huge-israel-donor-slams-the-nation-state-law-1.6362251?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;amp;__twitter_impression=true">here</a>.</p>

<p>The controlled media has also left Americans with an extremely distorted view of the Middle East, Zionism, and the history of Israel in general. This is by design.</p>

<p>The sons and daughters of the original Zionist terrorists have either occupied or controlled the highest positions of power in the Soviet, American and Israeli government since the Bolshevik Revolution.</p>

<p>Zionist Israel is a Godless faction hiding behind an iron curtain of deception. They are using the good name of the American people just as they are using the good name of the Jewish people to perpetuate their satanic war on peace and Christianity.</p>

<p>The New World Order is no longer &quot;new&quot;. This new order of things is on, it&#39;s the One World Order from here on out. One world for the Zionists.</p>

<p>This is how things are going to go. The Israeli Zionists are in control and their coming for all of us!</p>

<p>Dare to help stop the madness? Stayed vigilant. </p>

<p>Believe nothing, believe everything.</p>

<p>Are you implying that anyone who expresses opposition to or criticizes <strong>Semitism</strong> (AKA  Zionism/ Jewish Nationalism/Supremacism/Exceptionalism etc.) is &quot;mentally unhealthy&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“Jews domination in the state seems so assured that now not only can he call himself a Jew again, but he ruthlessly admits his ultimate national and political designs. A section of his race openly owns itself to be a foreign people, yet even here they lie. For while the Zionists try to make the rest of the world believe that the national consciousness of the Jew finds its satisfaction in the creation of a Palestinian state, the Jews again slyly dupe the dumb Goyim. It doesn’t even enter their heads to build up a Jewish state in Palestine for the purpose of living there; all they want is a central organization for their international world swindle, endowed with its own sovereign rights and removed from the intervention of other states: a haven for convicted scoundrels and a university for budding crooks.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, okay, so you forced me to search, an I found the quote -- on the <strong><em>Jewish Virtual Library</em></strong>, no less.</p>

<p>So you are saying that the quote from Hitler&#39;s <em>Mein Kampf</em> reminds you of ME?</p>

<p>Well, I must say that I do not appreciate the comparison. I am much taller than he was, and much better looking. Also, I grow a fuller mustache, AND I still have 2 testicles, lol!</p>

<p>That said, I do like dogs <em>(woof woof!)</em>, and it is said that Hitler liked dogs, so there&#39;s that... FWIW...</p>

<p>But it is also worth noting that, in the quote you provided, ol&#39; Dolphie specifically mentions <em>Zionists</em>, and their plans to create a Jewish State in Palestine... which is a rather interesting statement, as the book, <em>Mein Kampf</em>, was published in <strong>1925</strong>, some eight years <em>before</em> Hitler and his Nazi party seized power -- during a time when, on the whole, the Jews living in Germany were doing quite well, especially when compared to their ethnic German (non-Jewish) neighbors, as Germany was crushed under the weight of the arduous terms forced on them under the Treaty of Versailles -- and the resultant and ruinous hyperinflation it bred.</p>

<p>But I digress: The fact that <em>Mein Kampf</em> was published in 1925 -- and that it specifically addresses Zionist designs on Palestine debunks the widespread fallacy that Zionism was born from <strong><em>defensive reaction</em></strong> to the Holocaust, because it&#39;s publication <em>preceded</em> the Holocaust (and the Nazis rise to power) by many years.</p>

<p>Of course, both you and I have long known that said fallacy is bullshit -- propaganda pushed by deceptive historical revisionists -- but <em>many</em> people continue to labor under the illusion of this falsehood... the continued propagation of which (coincidentally), serves the agenda of the Zionist State and its supporters.</p>

<p>Imagine that.</p>

<p>Okay, so you&#39;ve already insinuated that I am an &quot;Anti-Semite&quot;, and tried to compare mot Hitler... so the question is, what ad hominem insult will you throw at me next?</p>

<p>While you ponder, I&#39;ll make popcorn. Is salted and buttered okay?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It goes much deeper than that I saw some documentary about how some Jewish Zionist literally wrote in a theology book a bunch of dogma on supporting the state of Israel. Theres a documentary on vimeo -Wikileaks linked it. Most Christian pastors love war. Most of them wrote letters of support and many if not all that did did not express any concern to the Iraq ear aftermath. There is a big movement of Orthodox jews against the Palestinian genocide, but obviously its not on the news and gets little media attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since this is r/conspiracy and anything goes, this is in line with what Christian preachers on YouTube and churches everywhere are using to indicate a sign of the end of days: </p>

<p>“I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars--I will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you.” Revelation 3:9</p>

<p>Israel’s nationalism is also pretty similar to those of the Jews in Galilee when Jesus was being persecuted. John 6 talks details how these Jews spoke to Jesus.</p>

<p>Galileeans: “We heard the goods news! You’re going to restore glory to Israel, right? Just like Moses and our amazing forefathers did?”</p>

<p>Jesus was like, “nah, that’s child’s play, fool. Y’all are talking about glorifying a people, and I’m I’m talking about believing in me. That’s how you get to Heaven. Which, to Hell with Earth – Heaven is pretty much the best thing in the history of Ever. Also, Moses didn’t give you jack shit, my Dad worked through him so that y’all would believe.”  </p>

<p>So the Jews kept murmuring “who does he think he is?” </p>

<p>And Jesus hears them and says, “I’m the son of G-d, believe it or not.” And he turns to the disciples who witnessed and this and said “y’all wanna leave too?”</p>

<p>The disciples responded, “I mean... we’ve seen your work, where are we gonna go?”</p>

<p>So Jesus responds “I was right to pick you 12...” right before throwing shade. “But one of you is a backstabbing bitch,” referring to Judas Iscariot. </p>

<p>Folks these days are also drawing parallels between the temple construction outlined in Revelation 11 and the current rebuilding of the third temple on Temple Mount: <a href="http://www.christiantruthcenter.com/third-temple-prophecy/">http://www.christiantruthcenter.com/third-temple-prophecy/</a></p>

<p>Revelation is a trippy book, man.</p>
