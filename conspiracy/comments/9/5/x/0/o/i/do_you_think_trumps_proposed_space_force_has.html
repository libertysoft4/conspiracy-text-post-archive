<p>There&#39;s been a lot of talk from Trump about creating a &quot;Space Force&quot; to compliment the other branches of our military here in the USA</p>

<p>The talk track is being number one in space for military reasons to protect us from other countries in the event of war, which makes sense and is a good idea I suppose </p>

<p>Although there is no talk about UFOs, aliens, etc... I think this is exactly the reason it&#39;s being proposed but under the guise of national security so as not to upset the masses</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on board with the Fleecing of America angle but with the relatively credible accounts of UFO sightings the past couple of years (and the mainstream coverage of these sightings) I&#39;m wondering if the cats out of the bag on UFOs being real and the government is trying to get ahead of it</p>

<p>If one day the aliens basically showed up in undeniable fashion and we had not done anything in preparation for this event in spite of the events that have been covered in media there would be this &quot;why not&quot; sentiment in the population</p>

<p>I was meditating one day in the park at dusk. Meditating that if there were aliens to give me a sign. Peace, love and light. Not but a few minutes from then a huge bright light came across the sky. Everyone in the park saw it. One guy&#39;s reaction was &quot;if that&#39;s a plane it&#39;s completely on fire&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>A drone is not a sign of alien life. Also, earth is not a planet. Earth is a plane. You just put a t at the end and turn it to a ball.

<p>Are you saying Saturn is a star with a ring around it? That it looks like other stars, because I&#39;ve seen the planets through a telescope and they look nothing like regular stars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just copy and pasting a previous post of mine because lazy</p>

<p>I have been thinking about this lately. With all the disclosure and Trumps bizarre &quot;Space Force&quot; comments, I think a rational explanation is that this is all a slow preemptive trickle for the next major global war. At that point the US and other nations will be forced to play their hands and introduce some of the new technologies they have been developing over the years. I don&#39;t think any of the wars since WW2 have been dire enough to warrant exposing new technologies and were therefore fought with more conventional technologies.</p>

<p>However when shit hits the fan and one nation introduces some exotic military weapon it will open up the floodgates and we will see all sorts of technologies developed under the blackest of budgets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps it is a cocktail of reasons... </p>

<p>Definitely has to do with the projection of military superiority, at a time when more nations than ever before are sending satellites into space. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that the UN or other World Powers are too worried about the US Space Force. Why? Because my gut feeling is that the UN, NATO and other World Powers have been privy to and engaging with ET&#39;s for decades.  Why wouldn&#39;t they tell us? <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/canadas-ex-defense-minister-aliens-would-give-us-more-tech-if-wed-stop-wars/">Well, the former defense minister of Canada,</a> has been spilling the beans.  US Navy just this year began releasing DOD footage of UFOs.  It&#39;s all calculated. for better or worse. </p>

<p>From Forrestal and McKinnon to DeLong and Greer, and through Von Braun, the message is clear: Intelligent Life, other than mankind, exists; don&#39;t let affect your behavior or ruin your day.  </p>
