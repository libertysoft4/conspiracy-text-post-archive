        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In relation to the recent YouTube bannings I am seeing many people try to argue they are entitled to certain rights such as freedom of speech on specific websites and on the internet in general.</p>

<p>This is completely and utterly wrong.</p>

<p>Your access to the internet is controlled by corporations, if you upset your ISP by doing something they do not like they can terminate your service, it says so right in the contract you, or someone else, signed to get access.</p>

<p>Web sites, like Youtube, Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, etc, are privately owned they do not owe you ANY rights of any kind and you concede to abiding by their Terms of Service just by creating an account, posting a comment or posting other content such as videos or podcasts.</p>

<p>You need to understand: </p>

<p>THEY OWN IT ALL.</p>

<p>YOU OWN NOTHING. </p>

<p>They own the physical lines coming to your house, they own the networking systems that allow you to access the internet.</p>

<p>They own the browsers you use to access sites.</p>

<p>You do not have rights you are paying for a service, a service that can be taken away from you anytime they choose to take it from you or limit your access.</p>

<p>An entire generation has become so dependent on this paid service  they believe access to the internet is actually a &quot;right&quot;.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be fooled into believing you have any rights or freedom on the internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would normally agree with you, however, my only qualm with your reasoning is it leaves out one important fact:  The service they are providing is quite literally speech.  If it was something like Amazon, and you do something to piss them off, such as making too many returns, boom your account is cancelled.  Or Uber, if you are abusive to the driver, or cancel too many rides, TOS, your account is revoked.  Moviepass, if you try to buy something at the concession stand, boom cancelled.<br/>
Where the line gets murky for me, is when your entire platform is based on speech, you have to at least consider that this might be a horse of a different color.  They are quite literally a forum for speech.  They decided to enter the market on the very principle of speech itself.  Haha, I&#39;m getting redundant here, but I hope you can consider my point.  </p>

<p>This is stated just as an observation of the situation, not necessarily saying one way or other other.  Just simply that with social media, the line is a lot murkier than your standard &quot;Private company reserves the right..&quot; etc etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Providing a platform for things to say does not equate to providing a platform for freedom of speech.</p>

<p>They have a TOS, if the user violates whatever they interpret to be the TOS at that time then, click, the user is gone.</p>

<p>Many, many have been kicked off youtube and none have found legal recourse allowing them back on unless youtube made a mistake they could not wriggle out of which is quite rare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, if you are inciting violence, or making threats, then yes, you should be gone.  But short of that, you should be able to say whatever you want, again referencing back to my argument that the very nature of their business is speech itself.  If they didn&#39;t want to deal with that, then they should have gone into the bakery business.  </p>

<p>Of course, this is all new territory.  I&#39;m just saying, I can see the case for someone to make this argument, and I would be inclined to agree.  Bakery and cake?  That&#39;s a different story.  But when you are the writer by typing, and somewhat of the publisher by hitting &quot;tweet&quot; or &quot;send&quot; or &quot;save&quot;, then that should provide you with basic rights of speech, or at the very least to be able to see someone making an argument to that end.</p>

<p>Corporations operate under government regulation. The government operates as representatives of the people. If the people want to change the regulations governing the internet, they are well within their rights to do so in a democratic manner.</p>

<p>Not to mention the huge number of laws and regulations that these corporations that you claim &quot;own it all&quot; must adhere to, including anti-trust laws.</p>

<p>Yeah, exactly my point. All you offer is defeatism.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need a revolution to enforce existing laws. The President himself said they will investigate the &quot;discriminatory and illegal practices&quot; of social media companies. No doubt you will consider this to be equally hopeless and useless. Either way, it&#39;s more than what you&#39;re offering - which is to preemptively wave the white flag in the face of corporate tyranny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to make sure that I understand your position.  So let&#39;s ignore websites for a moment and concentrate on ISPs.</p>

<p>You&#39;re claiming that if I go to an ISP and sign up and pay for internet service, and instead I get all of my packets redirected into a black hole or into some intentionally limited funhouse of shadow-banning bullshit, that I don&#39;t have a &quot;right&quot; to the actual internet service I purchased?  Is that your argument?</p>

<p>In the same way, would you be fine with walking into, say, a Walmart store to buy groceries but actually receiving poisoned food instead?  You don&#39;t have a &quot;right&quot; to food, after all.</p>

<p>What is the difference?</p>

<p>Let me spell it out for you:</p>

<p>When you sign up for internet service the contract you sign states that if you do something that is illegal or deemed unfit by the ISP they can terminate your service.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just that simple, you pay for a service and if the service provider doesn&#39;t like what you do they can cut you off and there is nothing you can do but attempt to find another provider.</p>
