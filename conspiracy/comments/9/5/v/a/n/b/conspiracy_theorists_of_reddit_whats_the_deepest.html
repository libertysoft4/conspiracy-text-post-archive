I think I&#39;ve been so adamant to &quot;wake people up&quot; that I didn&#39;t really consider how much people on here might know... So, I&#39;m kind of wondering: what do you guys know? Any &quot;alien involvement&quot; or anything like that? Earth origins? Plans for humanity? Nature of existence? Is religion a fraud? What&#39;s &quot;the big picture&quot;? Who&#39;s really running the show? I know a fair amount, so any &quot;half-ass attempts&quot; at trying to play something off as truth probably won&#39;t work with me. So anybody that has REALLY researched this stuff, please, lemme know what&#39;s up...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not at all what I&#39;m implying. This is a busy world full of various actors who struggle for control to various extents. There is no one entity that rules our physical plane. It can&#39;t be wrapped up as &quot;we have alien overlords,&quot; or &quot;the Vatican controls the world.&quot; </p>

<p>Every day new information comes out implicating various actors in any number of actions, however circumstantial the evidence or how tentative the connection. Much of the information is misinterpreted, purposefully skewed, or entirely fabricated. The point is that slowly, you see things that eat away at your bubble and make you question other constructs around you. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this can be conveyed by sharing a single link and that it&#39;s something that someone needs to develop on their own so as to be sure it&#39;s truly one&#39;s thoughts and beliefs that will be filling one&#39;s head. </p>

<p>this comment triggered a thought </p>

<p>why do people stay in their own little bubble?</p>

<p>because they are not self-actualized, according to maslow</p>

<p>why aren&#39;t people self-actualized?</p>

<p>because their own needs are not being met </p>

<p>and i think this is by design</p>

It included things like no belly buttons, no mention of pregnancy, no sharing beds, and no disrespect for government or religious authority figures.  Any police officer, priest, or American politician had to be portrayed as virtuous, or, if the story absolutely required it, and the studio pushed for it, then any corrupt official would have to be portrayed as an aberration and receive a hasty comeuppance.</p>

However, when people in positions of power in either scenario are not held accountable and unjust actions are allowed to continue, then unfair practices end up winning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Socialism/communism is the legalization of theft. This makes it inherently bad because you have to take from someone to give it to another. This is like saying Robin Hood is no thief because he stole from the rich to give to the poor. Problem is, this is still theft which is wrong. And this view is overly simplistic. Capitalism is the “best” model so far since it’s voluntary. I’m not saying it’s perfect or the system we have isn’t absolutely corporatist but capitalism is the best. Communism is the single deadliest political ideology ever known to man. It killed at least 100M in China alone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once you find out that the elite people in power have control over much of the world&#39;s resources, have influence in government, military, politics, media, Pharmaceuticals, corporations. Own most of the wealth in the world. Have heavy connections to central banking. Have recruited some of the top minds in the world for their think tanks to have population control over the masses through eugenics, technology, belief systems, public opinion because of their vast amount of knowledge of human psychology. Are able to do this without worrying about moral implications because most of the people on top are esoteric Satanists. Then find out how it&#39;s all intertwined  and hasee been going on for a very long time through secret societies. Then you want to find out whow thsese groups are.</p>

<p>Black Nobility, The Olympians, Committe of 300, Club if Rome, Bilderberg, Rothschilds, Zionists, Dark Freemasons, Cult of Aton, Tudor Dynasty, East India Company, Rosicrucians, Knights Templar, Cult of Mithras, The Atlanteans, Illuminati, Lucuferianism. </p>

<p>International Monetary fund, Federal Reserve, Bank of London, Bereau of International Settlements, Khazarian Mafia, Tavistock Institute, Committee of Foreign Relations. Most of the world&#39;s biggest corporations in Agriculture, Big Pharma, Corporate Banks, Military Industrial Complex, etc.</p>

<p>Once you understand that most of these organizations and secret societies have been based on ancient mystery schools from egypt (where most of the major religiins were influenced from) whose original purpose was to enlighten certain individuals who may enlighten the rest of humanity in the positive direction. But later learn that throughout the years those with the knowledge of the occult  have kept it to themselves to have an advantage and enslave the rest of humanity by keeping them in ignorance. Also by using all the institutions I have mentioned earlier. Then you may ask yourself why are these people such dicks.</p>

<p>Could it be because their ties to secret societies and positions in power, could it be because their religion is zionism, luciferiansm or greed. Could it be because they&#39;ve been doing it for hundreds of years and their not stopping until they achieve their NWO. Could it be because money and power has corrupted them. Or because they have superior knowledge of the occult and human psychology. Maybe because society lets rhem continue thesr things. I would say it&#39;s all these things but the root of it is simply because their hardcore psychopaths and the top and bottom of all levels of society. </p>

<p>What the difference in mentality of a common street thug who will kill and rob you for money, than a well educated highly successful psychopathic individual in wall street, banking, military, government, politics, or corporations. Not much other than the damage a thug can do and the damage an influential person in power can do. Afterall they have no compassion and can decide these things without feeling sympathy or guilt. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a battle of good and evil ultimately. Unless you&#39;re a moral relativists,sollipists or have subscribed to scientism. Then you may believe that you can&#39;t decide what&#39;s good or evil, or you don&#39;t care, or that the universe is so big that nothing matters. But for those who do care it might just make you angry or depressed. </p>

<p>Sadly I&#39;m not.someone who wants to change society but someone who wants people to be angry at it. To all those individuals who are working to teach people about morality and knowledge of this kind of stuff to enlighten humanity I just want to say thank you. </p>

<p>All this is just the tip of the iceberg because there is alot more that I dont know, and you should look into it yourself and not let people think for you especially me. Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me start off by saying that deep down I agree with you. </p>

<p>The problem I have is translating &quot;we&quot; into &quot;I&quot;.  While it&#39;s entirely possible that <strong>we</strong>, as a species, as a culture, as world, can live in a different way, <strong>I</strong>, ExpensiveBurn the lone man just trying to keep my electric on, can&#39;t.  </p>

<p>So, are you agreeing that <strong>we</strong> could, but <strong>I</strong> can&#39;t?  And if so, what&#39;s the solution, aside from trying to nudge society in that direction with whatever menial amount of influence I have?  That&#39;s pretty much where I&#39;m at now, but I still have to play the game just to subsist.  </p>

<p>If you&#39;re saying that I can in fact live a different life - without running away to the woods and living off rabbits and grass for the rest of my life - I have to ask how.  It&#39;s a question that&#39;s plagued me since my youth.  I&#39;ve taken a &quot;If you can&#39;t beat &#39;em, join &#39;em&quot; attitude in my later years.  Being an idealist about it is so futile.  At a certain point just sliding into your expected role is so much more rewarding.  And at the end of the day I&#39;m a hedonistic nihilist, so what&#39;s the difference, really?</p>

<p>Tell the truth, or at least don&#39;t lie. I&#39;ve found the saying that &quot;the truth will set you free&quot; to be true on so many levels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all. Though the truth is that you and I have a choice right now. We may not completely like our options and they might be very difficult  but we do have choices to start moving away from this lie and life. I think the first step is the battle that is informing everyone of the truth.That it doesn&#39;t have to be this way. For one we should not being paying rent to live on a world that we are born on. Who the fuck are they to tell us what we can do and how we can do it? We have given over our power and voice over to a bunch of power hungry psychopaths that only have their best interest at heart. Why the fuck have we given our land and our lives over to these people? Because they have been able to convince us over time that this is it and they&#39;ve managed to do it from the shadows. Again, we need to figure out a way to shine the truth on people, that is the first step. The second is once enough people or the right people are awaken then we start forming ideas of how to live the way we were meant to live and start coming to some sort of agreement on how we move forward. If we can accomplish the first step the possibilities are endless. We are meant to be truly free, not live like farm animals. We are slaves to these entities we gave the power to and to our own minds from being brainwashed. We have to wake people up and move forward from there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The difference is that if you and I or anyone else consciously experienced even a single moment where our actual potential came to light, if you knew for a fact who you really are and what you were put here to do and experience, if you remember that our consciousness is eternal, that we are being led to slavery and destruction than you wouldn&#39;t be able to keep living the life you are for one more second. Why just lay down? Why just except? Why not go out fighting for each other and fight for love? Why live as a slave and give them what they want? Dont you want to experience what  life is really meant to be? Don&#39;t you want  to be truly free like we were meant to be? We need to organize and fight. If not for ourselves, for each other, for our children, for our true selves. Don&#39;t give up. Please don&#39;t give up. You are so much more than this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The UFO thing entales way more than &quot;aliens&quot; or beings from another planet. Telepathy, psychic phenomenon, paranormal experiences, and more are all connected mysteries.</p>

<p>JFK was assassinated by a group including CIA, FBI, and the aerospace industry, in part for trying to share our secrets with Russia, like the &quot;UFO file&quot;.</p>

<p>Trumps uncle John Trump was the guy that recovered Nikola Tesla&#39;s papers, and was part of the &quot;RadLab&quot; along with Vanavar Bush and the Varian brothers. Vanavar Bush was in charge of the UFO file at one point. (No relation to Bush family) This group of people was responsible for various technological marvels, such as radars, and the foundation for computers and silicon valley. The same people that were close to the UFO </p>

<p>Robert Sarbarcher, one of the most infamous scientists in the US, and on the cover of Time was totally memory holed. He was one of the leading US scientists on the atom bomb project along with Oppenheimer. He was essentially deleted from existence for speaking openly in his later years about his knowledge on UFOs.</p>

<p>Nixon had a psychic advisor Jane Dixon and wrote a letter to Trump in 1987 saying he should be president. This letter can be seen in the National Archives.</p>

<p>Henry Wallace had the support of the people and should have been president instead of Truman. Henry Wallace was a theosophist, and basically described as a total pacifist. How different would we be today without having dropped the A bomb.</p>

<p>The same groups of people that shot JFK were just as well involved in assassinating RFK and MLK.</p>

<p>Robert Dornberger ome of the Nazi paperclip sciwntists headed up the Xplane project in the 60s that still holds speed records today. </p>

<p>The capability for CERN to effect the entire planet&#39;s magnetosphere, and even create effects that are not well understood on other planets in our solar system and sun. And the fact that its virtually impossible for anyone to independently recreate their experiments for verification of the breakthroughs they announce. And the fact that CERN is a soverign entity like its own country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say this is also my #1. We could call it the &quot;radical materialistic conspiracy&quot;, but I don&#39;t know to what extent it&#39;s a conspiracy, though keeping people</p>

<p>I believe the Hindus were onto something similar, as were the Taoists, and later the Buddhists, probably many shamananistic traditions as well. Though they vary in details, and some posit supreme beings, their essence is similar.</p>

<p>More than being (just) a conspiracy, which I&#39;m sure it also is and has been, it&#39;s a basic proclivity of the mind, human and otherwise, to experience reality in a dualistic fashion.</p>

<p>I can highly recommend the writings and talks by Don Hoffman on the topic: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oadgHhdgRkI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oadgHhdgRkI</a></p>

<p>In fact, we don&#39;t see reality, including the reality of ourselves as it is. We see only a constructed interface which we use to navigate a *something*, we have no idea where comes from.</p>

<p>According to Buddhism, which I think is correct, reality is simply the display of mind. Or as Hoffman puts it, &quot;entagled conscious agents&quot;. We co-create the material world, and in the words of Longchenpa, a great Buddhist scholar and yogi, &quot;all things arise as self-manifestation of the primordial state of creativity&quot;, a primordial, basic cognizance that is the root of all other phenomena. </p>

<p>There are many words to describe it, but they&#39;re all just fingers pointing to the moon. To see the moon itself, we have to look to where the finger is pointing rather than the finger.</p>

<p>We can turn the mind&#39;s gaze towards itself. One technique is actually to imagine turning the eyes inward (don&#39;t try to force it physically), another is to gaze into space. </p>

<p>The basic nature of reality is nothing but the creative potential of the mind, pure lucdity. </p>

<p>Because we are confused and take our transient ego-constructs, bodies, posessions, governments, money etc. to be true and real in their own right, rather than ephemeral mirages of our own co-creation in the expanse of cognizant space, we develop all sorts of negative emotions, which drives us along a eternal cycle of rebirth and death, where the contents of our minds determine the forms we create and inhabit.</p>

<p>This is known as samsara (wheel) in sanskrit.</p>

<p>These, at this point only intellectual realizations, made me recognize, that I am the own architect of my absolute enslavement, though many other factors and agents, with whom I have interacted since beginningless time, are part of my relative enslavement.</p>

<p>The path out of this endless cycle of pain and suffering is to recognize our true nature. </p>

<p>Once we do that, we see all manifestations of consciousness as they are: Utterly perfect. We cease to take rebirth based on ignorance and cause-and-effect, and instead take rebirth based on wisdom and love, which is probably one of the reasons there are so many good people in a dying world such as ours.</p>

<p>Reality is what we make it, and there is not a single experience we have, in which we ourselves do not have a part in or connection to its causes.</p>

<p>Anyway, the biggest conspiracy, in my view, is that we constantly deceive ourselves into thinking there is a true, solid self, when we can ascertain by our own direct experience, that the only constant, permanent phenomena there is, is the ability of our minds to experience and create.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that&#39;s the hard part for us. Knowing what reality is, being able to formulate it as I just did? Not that hard. Actualizing the state of abiding in the nature of mind/consciousness rather than grasping at phenomena, including the ego? That&#39;s another story. We can use all the concepts we want, but without direct, experiential realization, they are of little help. They can serve to motivate, however, just like telling a smoker that smoking kills can eventually lead to them stopping, but intellectual thought and realizing and manifesting what it entails are is not the same, and the latter seems to be a lot harder.</p>

<p>There are many teachings on how to accomplish the path. According to Buddhism, they are all compassionate examples set forth by those who have traversed it before us, aimed at beings of different capacities and inclinations.</p>

<p>This is why there are many schools within Buddhism, and it may very well be why there are many valid spiritual traditions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it feels so real. When we see it&#39;s a dream, and realize that it&#39;s a nightmare for everyone, at least most of the time, particularly in the end, it can spur immense compassion in us.</p>

<p>Just like most other things we do, if we&#39;re doing it for a greater purpose, the more energy we have. Therefore, if we engage in the project of realizing and actualizing our own, true nature because we aspire to liberate countless beings who we understand we are intimately connected with, we will have a massive thrust, so to speak.</p>

<p>This is the premise of the Mahayana (the Great Vehicle) path, which focuses on compassion and by extension the wisdom which uncovers the means to practice it.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, the joining of the palms often seen as a greeting among Buddhists and Hindus alike is symbolic of the union of wisdom and compassion.</p>

<p>In the tantric traditions, wisdom is seen as the feminine aspect, while compassion or method is seen as the masculine, and their perfect union is enlightenment.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about anyone else, but this kinda stuff is more inspiring to me than most other ideologies or religions: &quot;You&#39;re all powerful, but you forgot. It&#39;s all within your own mind. All you need to do is sit down and get to know your own experience while realizing that kindness is more important than anything.&quot; </p>

<p>To me that&#39;s powerful.</p>

<p>At the same time, I find Buddhism to be intellectually rigid and precise, avoiding all (most of) the bullshit of other religions.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a good reason most of us aren&#39;t actually practicing that path: It threatens what we think of as &quot;us&quot;. </p>

<p>“You’re playing hide and seek with yourself. You’re just passing eternal time with adventure. You forget who you are really. Every now and then You make like you’re just a John Doe or a Mary Smith, or a butterfly, or a worm, or a star and that you’re lost in the middle of a big, big, outside world that isn’t you, that you don’t understand and that you don’t control. Of course! There has to be something else … something other … to bring out the feeling that You are you. And so that You can feel really you, that outside world has to feel really strange, different, weird. You old trickster … deep down inside, You know the whole bit. And therefore, what You want is a surprise. So you have to let things get out of control. You have to feel lost and lonely to know You as you. You play the thing out by inventing lusts and loves, fears and terrors, gnawing anxieties and screaming mee-mee’s… But our secret is… as we say… Tatvamasi… You Are IT. You are running the show, by not letting your right hand know what your left is doing. By making life as a whopping great split between what You DO and what happens to You.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. That&#39;s a fairly new agey concept, unsupported by empiricism, both subjective and objective. At the same time, everything and everyone are intimately connected. A good question, however, is whether those who have gone beyond dualistic cognition experience themselves as discrete entities. The Dalai Lama says that even after enlightenment a semblance of individuality exists.</p>

<p>Yeah, sure. But what do you know with certainty right now? You know you have a subjective experience of your life, of this now, of your past, hopes, fears, dreams, regrets.</p>

<p>In any case, you have *your* experience. The hypotheticals, parallel universes and alternate realities may exist, but you&#39;re not there. You&#39;re here.</p>

<p>We&#39;re right here. What we experience as &quot;us&quot; is transient, it&#39;s made up, a construct, and it changes all the time. What doesn&#39;t change is the fact that you&#39;re having an experience of it.</p>

<p>That is you. Your experience right now. Nothing more, nothing less, and it doesn&#39;t need to be. It&#39;s perfect as it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really, sorry. I came to this realisation/understanding as a product of all the information I&#39;ve taken in over the years and through my own personal experiences.<br/>
I grew up agnostic/atheist, have been a big science buff since my mid teens (especially physics), and in my late teens I started looking at Buddhism and meditation. The more I researched and read about eastern philosophy the more I realised that it read very much like the way some concepts are talked about in quantum mechanics, only more in metaphor. This then lead me to stay doing more research into other religions while simultaneously learning more physics (holographic theory is what I&#39;ve been educating myself on most recently), theories of consciousness, and taking my spiritual practice more seriously (utilising mindfulness more in my day-to-day life, mediating, learning to love more). But I suppose one of the few things that really solidified a part of this for me was my first astral projection. I&#39;d lucid dreamed before, so I was somewhat prepared to try to see the ways in which lucid dreaming and astral projection are similar, but that first projection and the straight up feeling of your relative human consciousness literally leaving your body is indescribable and unlike anything I&#39;d experienced in waking or dream life. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a contradiction and it&#39;s logically challenged. In addition, it&#39;s typed and formatted in a way traditionally associated with mental illness. Since it doesn&#39;t contribute to the conversation and it appears otherwise to be a form of counter-intelligence auto-spam, shouldn&#39;t moderators remove it before any more damage is done? </p>

<p>By damage, I mean feeding a mental illness or otherwise encouraging it, or allowing discourse control mechanisms to continue operation and influence public opinion through volume and taking advantage of human nature and it&#39;s herd instincts, such as the semantic weakness of accepting &quot;the wisdom of the crowd&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Years and years of research, my friend, and I encourage you to do it, as well. First off, I&#39;ve had my own DMT breakthrough experiences, which are convincing in that they show you that non-human higher intelligences, i.e. aliens, exist. Not only do they exist, but they seem very interested in helping us evolve, which is incredibly fascinating. If this is true, and it is, why is there also so much horror in the world? Wars all over, drug war, destruction of the environment? There seems to be a predatory force at play. I always assumed it was human- but why?? </p>

<p>I did pay some attention to David Icke&#39;s work and considered it. I don&#39;t love his personality so much, but a lot of his information is solid, especially about ancient texts and what they say concerning &quot;archons/reptilians.&quot; References to these evil creatures is <em>ubiquitous</em> in ancient writing. I dug deeper, and the most interesting stuff I found is in the ancient Gnostic writings. They said, detailed in the &quot;Nag Hammadi Library,&quot; a collection of books discovered in Egypt in 1947, that we live amidst an alien war, with archons preying us on, while &quot;Gaia,&quot; the living Earth actually created us and wants us to thrive. They challenged the Abrahamic religions directly, saying that they&#39;re tools of control and oppression, which they are. The best single book I found on the subject is &quot;Not in HIS Image&quot; by John Lash (John also has talks on YouTube.) It&#39;s very interesting, pretty convincing stuff when you dive into the details.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also evidence presented by Joseph Farrell that there was once a massive interplanetary war in our solar system between good and evil forces. You really have to read about it to give it credence; check out &quot;The Cosmic War&quot; by Joseph Farrell. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of evidence of humans meeting with ET&#39;s and so forth, but it&#39;s so much, it&#39;s hard to know where to start. I really recommend the podcast Non Human Entities. Punch that into YouTube. </p>

<p>I think we&#39;re living in a cosmic war, and humans are a proxy battle for greater forces, both good and evil. Eat some psychedelic mushrooms someday and ponder it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One Page Situation Update for August 8, 2018</p>

<p>The Current System:</p>

<p>· A Scottish corporation calling itself  “The United States of America, Inc.” and a Delaware corporation calling itself the “United States of America, Inc.” run by the Roman Catholic Church have been usurping upon our Government.... since 1868;</p>

<p>· They have provided the 19 enumerated services required by the original Constitution –and a lot more we never asked for --under fraudulently assumed contracts;</p>

<p>· The labor of the American People and their other assets have been used as tradable commodities to pay for all these services;</p>

<p>· Our legal system was unlawfully converted into a private debt collection service to seize our assets to pay for all this foreign spending on our tickets;</p>

<p>· Bottom line: we have been defrauded and enslaved in gross Breach of Trust.  The purported Trustees have stolen our individual identities and racked up huge bills against our credit— just like any credit card thief.</p>

<p>The Correction to Be Made:</p>

<p>· The original unincorporated Federation of States doing business as The United States of America has organized and objected to the circumstance described above;</p>

<p>· The Federation States and People have been called to Assemble;</p>

<p>· We have the power to restore our lawful government and put an end to the abuses;</p>

<p>· Trump was elected to help restore our lawful republican form of government;</p>

<p>· All Governors have been briefed and the President as Commander-in-Chief is leading an orderly transition.</p>

<p>Where We Are Going:</p>

<p>· The fifty State republics of The United States of America are still alive and functioning;</p>

<p>· These States are not “States of States”;</p>

<p>· Our States are the Priority Creditors of all the bankrupt Federal Territorial and Municipal States of States and are heir to all the assets and property these foreign organizations were holding and managing “for” us;</p>

<p>· We, the People of this country, address the fraud committed against each one of us, get our own records corrected, and assemble our State organizations;</p>

<p>· Our States reclaim and receive back all the assets we are owed and direct control of our property is returned to us;</p>

<p>· Our State Deputies meet “in Congress Assembled” in Philadelphia to take care of long overdue business and chart a way forward;</p>

<p>· The United States of America, the actual federation of our States, helps President Trump “Make America Great Again!”</p>

<p>The way we are progressing through the timeline currently makes it possible for that future to exist.</p>

<p>In that future we lose our Humanity, we will literally stop being humans if they get their way.</p>

<p>Free will exists and there is a probability that we can create a different timeline for Ourselves and if we manage to do that, that future which exists now will cease to exist... and maybe we can build a better one.</p>

<p>He spoke of direct democracy though electronic means.  He spoke of Nafta negatively BUT discussed <em>WHY</em> it was bad.  It was a race to the bottom.  </p>

<p>So they ridiculed him. Talked funny, big ears... not the common man cause he&#39;s an oil tycoon, etc etc.</p>

<p>And it worked.  I was middle school age then, and before looking deeply into it, and all I can remember was that he talked funny and had big ears.  But the man was trying to help and educate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One that has gotten me downvoted on here is the relationship of USGS seismology data to covert military ops. </p>

<p>The USGS is manipulated to cover-up bombings by deleting &quot;erroneous&quot; surface quakes. Usually it does this automatically, but 5.0 and above are still recorded around the world. The ones to watch are the &gt;5.0s that they delete about 5 to 24 hours later. </p>

<p>For example, the North Korean incident this last winter. NK kept threatening world war 3 so the US military decided to do a &quot;fly-by&quot;. At the exact same time as their fly-by, a 5.3m earthquake was recorded by the USGS on (above ground) the exact same spot as the NK nuclear missile base. The next day, Russia made its move and bombarded the western NK boarder as a show of force. The next day after that, the conglomerate news stations report that Kim Jong Un has asked the US for amnesty in case of a military coup. </p>

<p>After SK and NK make peace, no one looks at China anymore about failing to end trade with NK and Trump forgives Kim of all his atrocities. </p>

<p>The display of power that the US showed wasn&#39;t just military, it was teaching Kim Jong Un how to manipulate his people the profitable way. We want their natural resources, which NK is rich with (like Afghanistan), but we can&#39;t invade because Russia will strike before we do, and it wouldn&#39;t go over well with China either. Instead, we publicly do a military demonstration that we then delete from history and give NK the chance to make it look like their idea. It&#39;s the same thought process as civilian control: make your slaves think they are free.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Much of the damning evidence was deleted within hours. Stocks dropped that week as well. I deleted most information I had when I started hearing high frequency data interference from my phone. I don&#39;t know if it was just being used to paint my locale for a satellite or if it was the Intel processor being used for what they made it to do for the military, but turning it off seemed to work. It was so bad that my gf heard it too and the cats ran into the other room. </p>

<p>What to look for is:
1. Extreme fearmongering from conglomerate media on the international subject
2. Call to action from an executive level, but no specific threat. The executive branch will do it all the time. 
3. Watch the earthquakes in that area like a hawk. 
4. Watch for a corresponding stock market drop and which companies gained. 
5. Watch the conglomerate media tell an opposite story within a week. (Clue to sell high what was bought low.)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen it happen a number of times. It boils down to classic stock manipulation for civilian gain, using a patterned communication that illicits an investor response. If you had enough money to make a difference, you can really win big with this type of research. The headache inducing interference scared me so bad that I haven&#39;t poked around much since. </p>

<p>Keep an eye on SpaceX stocks, as their subsidiaries are going to be leading contractors with Trump&#39;s &quot;Space Force&quot;. 2020-2021 is going to be the housing market slump. Banking for marijuana companies is a new niche. Quantum computer coding, perpetual batteries and the use of 3D rendering to compute metadata are the R&amp;Ds to look into.</p>

9-11 was essentially a coup, making W a powerless puppet rather than head of state
Much of the world is governed by an oligarchy 
Media is controlled and in turn controls us
Govt wants us 
-in debt so we have to work
-mezmerized by television so we wont think
-afraid and anxious so we let them &quot;protect&quot; us
-fighting fake battles and having fake victories via sports and video games
-with very little savings
-well enough to go to work but a little sick. Not vital and healthy enough to organize or revolutionize.
Student loans and the emphasis of college over trade school is a manipulation to create generations of people with heavy debt and no offsetting asset like a house. They make money on tuition and interest and make sure you wont be marching because you have to shut up and get back to work.
The educational system was dumbed down deliberately in the early 20th century and continuing to today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got to ask a &quot;high-level&quot; freemason some questions in private a few months back, and one of them was along the lines of:</p>

<p><em>&quot;Do the war-criminals and bastards in power actually believe they are acting towards a greater good, or are they deliberately and consciously evil?&quot;</em> To which he replied something to the effect of <em>&quot;Everyone invariably thinks they&#39;re the good guys, even and especially the villains.&quot;</em></p>

<p>That answer has stuck with me and it has sharpened my perspective on how some conspiracies connect, and how they might be justified in the minds of the perpetrators. And not only that, but it&#39;s made psychopathy and sociopathic ideations... understandable isn&#39;t the right word as that carries the connotation of excusable, but graspable I guess.</p>

<p>It also relates to the old saying that &quot;The Road to hell is paved by good intentions&quot;. What are good intentions? I&#39;ve had friends of mine casually justify a depopulation agenda as the moral or virtuous thing to pursue, to my horror. I get where they&#39;re coming from, because I&#39;ve been listening to the same cultural songs and stories that they have, but I&#39;ve since learned that overpopulation is an utter myth (as long as we don&#39;t continue to exploit resources quite as stupidly as we have been), but it&#39;s still been a wakeup call to hear what kinds of values have become commonplace in Western culture, and how justified everyone feels about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true. And they&#39;re not entirely wrong either, but I do believe those truly evil motherfuckers live a bastardized version of dualism. </p>

<p>Taoism is another version of the same basic principle of necessary and balancing opposites, but embracing Taoism doesn&#39;t seem to lead to the same kind of appetite for power and control as the Western doctrine of dualism tends to.</p>

<p>Equally, there are very sensible satanists out there, who may or may not see that dualism is a rough, rough description of reality rather than a guide for moral behaviour. Useful, sure, even liberating, but deadly with the wrong ideas attached.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That a large portion of the worlds powerful oligarchs, politicians, priests and financiers take part in systematic pedophilia. This all seemed a bit crazy, but it became very clear to me at some point.</p>

<p>The practice is ancient within powerful enclaves. Men have been taking boys as lovers/projects for millennia. It was accepted, tolerated and not spoken about. With the advent, rightfully so, of this practice being criminalized and widely abhorred it has taken on a new role. How do the most powerful exert dominance and control - they partake in the most taboo. It also serves as entertainment when your wealth allows for every manner of entertainment possible - it’s the final frontier.</p>

<p>The final piece of this is indoctrination. When you are brought into these cabal’s and participate in these acts, you are tied and beholden. You give up free will for power. Being exposed would be disastrous and you are a part of a larger cohort with the same interests and stakes at play. </p>

<p>I’m not totally sure on the cult/satanist/ritualistic aspects of this on a broader scale. I believe that often gets obfuscated and lumped in to add depth and darkness. I’d like to know more about this in time.</p>

<p>The Franklin Cover Up was real. Systemic abuse in the Catholic Church is real. Broad pedophilia and child rape within British Parliament and policing is real. Ronald Reagan had underage call boys in the White House. George H. W. Bush was involved in broad pedophilia and child trafficking. And there are children moved all over the globe to satisfy the desires of these powerful individuals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn good evidence. I went in as a complete skeptic. I&#39;ve heard so much testimony that even if only 1% of these people were telling the truth, then these things are out there. Unfortunately, I&#39;ve found that MOST of them are telling the truth. There are at least (meaning verified) four different types of &quot;Bigfoot-esque&quot; creatures living in the woods and sparsely populated areas of North America. There are more all over the world, but I&#39;ve only found verification of North America as of now. </p>

Besides the new amendments to keep people happy(and prevent violent revolts) such as women suffrage, black rights, LGBT, legalization, etc all the laws are meant to protect the &#39;haves&#39; from the &#39;have nots&#39;. Also, our capitalist world basically ensures there will be some people working for way less then normal. Slavery is the most unethical, but also most profitable business model.

It all goes to Bush Sr. I started researching things on him and his shady days go all the way back to the JFK assassination. Then he was tied up in the Reagan assassination attempt. The Bush Fam just happened to be family friends with the Hinckley&#39;s. Then Hinckley was sent to the hospital tied to most of the MKULTRA experiments. Just a few weeks after the attempt on Reagan, Bush was given the keys to the shadow Govt kingdom. Unprecedented for a Vice President. That is when he really got everything started.</p>

<p>Indira Singh is the only credible witness to 9/11. She had no agenda, she had no bias and she left a very lucrative career to pursue the truth of 9/11. She got tied up into stuff because of her job on Wall St. She just doesn&#39;t get the play she should because she doesn&#39;t link Israel to being the mastermind. She does link Bush Sr, Saudi Arabia, and the CIA though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, there&#39;s no such things as &quot;becoming a conspiracy theorist.&quot; It&#39;s not a club and everyone *should* be open-minded and genuinely interested in the truth. But yeah, there&#39;s a red pill, and most people don&#39;t take it, you&#39;re right.</p>

<p>The biggest one is aliens and the extreme level of alien involvement in our species. I won&#39;t bother linking, because you&#39;re perfectly capable of going on Youtube and punching these names in or looking up books. The best way to really dive into alien land is to smoke DMT, but it sounds like you&#39;re already open-minded, so check out some of the literature on shamanism and Gnosticism. The ancient Gnostics said that humans are essentially a proxy war for competing alien forces, one very good and interested in our evolution, another- the &quot;Archons&quot;- interested in destroying us. The Archons supposed have a base on Saturn and also a small presence here on Earth, underground, where there are vast military bases and tunnels (check out Richard Sauder on that subject).</p>

<p>The best book I recommend on ancient Gnosticism is &quot;Not in HIS Image&quot; by John Lash. (he&#39;s also on YouTube)</p>

<p>Going way deeper on aliens and deeply analyzing the Nazis and the spread of Nazism *after* the war, with a connection to ET&#39;s- read the books by JOSEPH P. FARRELL, or listen to him on YouTube; he&#39;s got tons of material on there. He may be the deepest and most legit conspiracy researcher alive. He ties together ancient alien cosmological scientific data with the modern Nazi phenomenon, and it&#39;s fucking fascinating. I can&#39;t recommend him too strongly.</p>

<p>On the modern UFO phenomenon, the virtual Bible is &quot;UFO&#39;s and the National Security State&quot; by Richard Dolan. It&#39;s a must read, or at least check out Dolan&#39;s talks. He makes an impeccable case for many UFO sightings being non-human in nature (and explains how many others are bogus. It&#39;s very detailed).</p>

<p>On really big-picture stuff I recommend listening to Terence McKenna exhaustively.</p>

<p>For 9/11 analysis and legit scientifically-informed perspectives on alien and technology questions, I recommend &quot;Alien Scientist&quot; on YouTube.</p>

<p>For more good 9/11 analysis, I recommend Webster Tarpley and his book &quot;9/11: Synthetic Terror.&quot;</p>

There&#39;s no doubt that our govts and media are completely corrupt, but it goes deeper than that. There is real evil in the world and it is hiding in plain sight and people are either too focused on the wrong things or too scared to fight jt head on. We are all connected and stronger than this evil will ever be. However, we are not as strong as we should be right now (even though our connections are getting stronger than ever before) because we are all focused selfishly on ourselves even though there is no such thing as you or me...it&#39;s just us.  That fact had been consistently hidden from us throughout our history by this evil by pitting ourselves against each other over and over again. Red vs blue. Rich vs poor. Black vs white.</p>

Sumeria is not the oldest civilization.  Evolution, while true, didn&#39;t happen the way we think it did.  Sphinx is at least 12,000 years old and the pyramids are probably too.   WW1 and WW2 weren&#39;t at all about what you think it was.  Governments and media lie.  Vietnam was started on a lie.  Stalin vs Hitler, who was more evil?  Yet who did the US side with?  Daily recommended food guidelines are a lie.   Food pyramid is a lie.  Salt is not bad for you.   Vegetable oil is worse than animal oils.  Sugar is worse than all of them combined.

    <div class="md"><p>Society is lost.</p>

<p>People are pawns that are farmed for their intellectual resources and labor and most of them are too stupid to realize it.</p>

<p>Most of the disease on earth could be cured, the powers that be would rather watch you suffer.</p>

<p>Religion is nothing more than a cult and a control mechanism and the members of the cult will attack you for pointing it out. The same goes for people who believe in government.</p>

<p>Statism is cancer. </p>

<p>If more people cared and loved about you, you&#39;d live much longer but they won&#39;t because they&#39;ve taught to be selfish and create life into a rat race with socially engineered cultures of limited thinking.</p>

<p>There is beyond enough resources for everyone to live happy, wealth is relative and soon being a millionaire will be meaningless and the new millionaire will be the billionaire. This cycle will continue as more and more money is added into circulation until the individual units have been reduced in value so greatly that the economy that was created inside people&#39;s delusions will crumble.</p>

<p>Things that make real positive changed are often destroyed by the very people they are supposed to help. People with $0 in their heavily taxed bank account say bad things about Bitcoin because the for-profit news that runs on a network that displays advertisements for bullshit every seven minutes told them how to think about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two biggest for me:</p>

<p>-First isn&#39;t so much a conspiracy as it is a refusal for mainstream historians and scientists to look deeper into pre-history. The work of Schoch and others is sound and at the very least, worth investigating further, but plenty don&#39;t want to look into it. There&#39;s probably some conspiracies at the top of governments of Egypt and elsewhere, since proving these claims would upend history, and by extension religion and its power. But I really think the bigger reason it&#39;s not taken seriously is because people are afraid of being labeled &quot;pseudo-historian&quot; or being lumped in with the crazies who instantly claim &quot;aliens!&quot;</p>

<p>-The biggest conspiracy theory, and the one we&#39;re stilling grappling with today is the Assassinations of JFK and RFK. JFK&#39;s murder (The Coup of &#39;63) led to the neo-cons cementing their power and stronghold over this country. Back when the deep state was actually &quot;deep&quot;, and not operating in the open like they do now, the CIA, military, gov&#39;t, with the mafia and others, killed the rightfully elected President, and from there implemented their foreign policy goals that lead to Vietnam and further disasters. They haven&#39;t lost power since.</p>

<p>RFK is crazier when it comes down to the actual assassination, and the CIA legit hypno-programmed a human being to kill him. They were afraid of what an RFK presidency represented (he&#39;d come after those who killed his brother, and also be a continuation of most of JFK&#39;s policies that the deep state didn&#39;t want). I&#39;ve often thought that although the JFK assassination was &quot;worse&quot; in the sense that they killed the president, RFK&#39;s death was &quot;worse&quot; for the country, as he would&#39;ve done more than his brother, and potentially ushered in reforms to the gov&#39;t that would&#39;ve had us prosper in the long run.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DMT is a legit portal (albeit temporary) out of this perspective and into the all. The other day I took a half hit (around 10mg) so not enough for a full breakthrough, and was watching King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizards music video &quot;Robot Stop&quot;. It&#39;s a trippy video and my last few experiences had been lackluster so I was trying to trip myself out. After a few moments of watching the video I felt a strong compulsion to stop the video, once I did I immediately left my body and fell through several dimensions into a white cube world. Front and center was a female entity and on a pedestal next to her was a bit from the video I was watching. She chided me for watching the video while on dmt as if to say &quot;I cannot believe you were using this human stuff in an attempt to trip yourself out when WE are the masters of all things trippy&quot;. After apologizing profusely, she than began to go through each frame of the video offering criticism on how simple and terrible it was in the grand scheme of things. While all this was happening all manners of bizarre ineffable shit was going on all around me. I could see in 360°, and two other entities were to my left and right showing me ineffable constructs and blueprints. After a few moments that felt like eternity I could feel my human eyes as I flowed back into my body. When I opened them everything around me was flowing to this cadence which was kinda choppy, might&#39;ve been the timing used in the song from earlier. The dmt entities flowed through my TV, playstation, PC, walls, bed, floor. Everything had a distinct Mayan feeling, until I was fully redownloaded into my body. Then I proceeded to say &quot;HOLY SHIT, HOLY SHIT, HOLY SHIT!&quot; about a million times. That was the most bizarre, vivid experience I&#39;ve ever had. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The government does not have to use power to control the masses and its agendas, it only has to use social cost. Slowly I have seen Western morality perverted and subverted by &quot;progressive&quot; virtues and values, starting with those in power, and slowly trickling down to the middle class, where it has finally been rejected by the working class. Words like &quot;racist&quot; are perverted to have a whole new meaning and are never equally applied, because they exist for a purpose now. Words like Islamophobia are used to silence speech and dissident against a patriarchal, authoritarian death cult that would only benefit those in power. Hate speech is used whenever those with power desire, to silence and ostracize political opponents. Government&#39;s don&#39;t have to use force to control us anymore, they just have to make the social cost to disagree with those in power too high. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>21st Century modernity is a social delusion, shared among those living in a static western civilisation, with a common faith in technological progress going hand in hand with increasing human tolerance and understanding.</p>

<p>It&#39;s total balls, of course, but that&#39;s how our society thinks about itself. We are so thoroughly in thrall to this waking dream that we cannot comprehend how anyone could wish to live in a different way.</p>

<p>Hence the insane scenario in which invading Iraq and removing the Ba&#39;athist regime was predicted to make Iraq into a functioning modern democracy overnight. 15 years later, it shows no sign of emerging.</p>

<p>We&#39;re not in the &#39;endgame&#39; phase of Western civilisation, not by a long chalk, but we are in a very vulnerable position whether we realise it or not -- open to very dark urges and forces both from within and from without, and in fact one might conjure the other into existence. There are signs that this is already under way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Denial and bias are inherent aspects of the human psyche. At every point in history, every culture on the planet was filled with people holding ideas that were laughably and obviously wrong. Furthermore, these people will adamantly and fervently defend their wrong ideas from the attack of any skepticism. Galileo was jailed for saying that the Earth was not the center of the universe. Thomas Paine was jailed for arguing that Christianity (and organized religion in general) was a lie used to control the masses. I read an article recently about a prestigious doctor in the mid 19th century who discovered that the reason many women were dying during childbirth in hospitals was that physicians&#39; were not washing their hands after performing autopsies. He told and hospital and they ceased the practice (and the death rate dropped dramatically), but the vast majority of hospitals ignored him.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to get at is the idea that the reason people do not believe in controversial ideas is not because there is a lack of evidence for those ideas, it is because of an innate quality of the human mind which can&#39;t acknowledge divergent information. When you get into conspiracy stuff, you realized pretty soon that many people will not agree with you, regardless of what you say. It&#39;s not about debate. It&#39;s not about evidence. It&#39;s about some kind of weird psychological problem</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“The powers the be” are a group of people who have steered human civilization dating back thousands of years. Those at the very top are not often known by the public. They believe in something - a religion - a history - something - that drives their actions on a very deep level. That something could be knowledge of our origins here and what we are, it could be some form of satanism, it could be extraterrestrial or inter dimensional intelligences, or all of the above. </p>

<p>They have access to or knowledge of technology that is beyond most people’s comprehension. They control the population worldwide in a variety of ways to keep people busy and distracted. The main mechanism of control is society itself - money, work, family, time - all things that keep people from looking outside of themselves and their immediate bubble. Ignorance, depression, certain “approved” drugs like alcohol and opioids, conflict are all both consequences and mechanisms of this control. Conflict in particular, and duality / good vs evil, are very important to them. </p>

<p>Money and power is not the ultimate motivation behind their actions. There is something much deeper at play, and there are many theories as to what that motivation is. It is likely something that would shatter our global society if people knew. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Long time lurker checking in. 
Here are some things I have picked up on this wild ride: Protect and Defend Your Consent, Do Not Give Your Consent Away, your freedom to have self determination endures beyond this life. No one but yourself can save you (not Jesus , not Buddha, not God ). You and I  along with all of our friends and family have been brainwashed, the pure devious genius of brainwashing is victims do not even know they are brainwashed. Most of r/conspiracy has not woken up to the fact that this “great awakening” is not organic nor due to good triumphing over evil. I urge you to WAKE UP! You and I are being initiated by an intentional massive occult paradigm shift, New Age philosophy is bullshit, do not surrender your consent to another hierarchal pyramid to climb.Question everything, ask yourself, “Why are all of these events manifesting now? ie: Government releasing footage of UFOs,  high profile hollywood arrests, Occult Texts and dogma surfacing online etc. etc. Many of us believe it is a restructing to maintain societal control and so TPTB can remain as the premier power no matter which belief system wins out. Our history was  hijacked by Saturn Worship. Etymology, (def: the study of the origin of words and the way in which their meanings have changed throughout history) makes this abundantly clear. Mankind had an advanced and mature global communication society pre 100,000 BCE and was nearly wiped out in a torrential flood/ record amount of rainfall that destroyed much of this civilization’s physical presence due to rapidly rising sea levels, eg:All religions have an origin story that describes a “Great Flood”.<br/>
The soul is real. Reincarnation is real. I am not sure how pervasive  and to what extent Karma is in this system, the jury is still out as far as I can surmise. Prayer is synonomous with meditation.
 We each have a higher self who is looking out for us, you can learn to interpret its messages sometimes through dreams, sometimes from happenstance and “coincidences” . You can access any information you seek if you know how to meditate effectively, find a way that works for you and always be willing to try new things. The reality we live is in entirely composed of energy, energy is emited as waves. Try to understand the extent of how limited and unreliable our senses are at recording and interpreting data/stimuli,(the impossible will quickly become both imaginable and possible). Study magnetism and the torus field.  </p>

<p>Be a light in the darkness, help others and guide them to find their own profound truths. We are all in this together, get busy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone may have said this already, but Alan Watts changed my life. The first time I heard the following quote, I knew there was truth in it. It was like uncovering some long buried and forgotten memory.</p>

<p>“You’re playing hide and seek with yourself. You’re just passing eternal time with adventure. You forget who you are really. Every now and then You make like you’re just a John Doe or a Mary Smith, or a butterfly, or a worm, or a star and that you’re lost in the middle of a big, big, outside world that isn’t you, that you don’t understand and that you don’t control. Of course! There has to be something else … something other … to bring out the feeling that You are you. And so that You can feel really you, that outside world has to feel really strange, different, weird. You old trickster … deep down inside, You know the whole bit. And therefore, what You want is a surprise. So you have to let things get out of control. You have to feel lost and lonely to know You as you. You play the thing out by inventing lusts and loves, fears and terrors, gnawing anxieties and screaming mee-mee’s… But our secret is… as we say… Tatvamasi… You Are IT. You are running the show, by not letting your right hand know what your left is doing. By making life as a whopping great split between what You DO and what happens to You.”</p>

<p>I suggest listening to his talks while comfortable in a dark room with no distractions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Socialism/communism is the legalization of theft. This makes it inherently bad because you have to take from someone to give it to another. This is like saying Robin Hood is no thief because he stole from the rich to give to the poor. Problem is, this is still theft which is wrong. And this view is overly simplistic. Capitalism is the “best” model so far since it’s voluntary. I’m not saying it’s perfect or the system we have isn’t absolutely corporatist but capitalism is the best. Communism is the single deadliest political ideology ever known to man. It killed at least 100M in China alone. </p>
