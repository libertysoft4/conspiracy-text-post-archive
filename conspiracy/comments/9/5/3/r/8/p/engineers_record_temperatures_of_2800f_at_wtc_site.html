<p>Engineers from Bechtel group led by a member of the American Society of Safety Engineers measured temperatures in excess of 2800°F at the Ground Zero site following 9/11/2001.</p>

<p>The absolute maximum temperature of hydrocarbon (diesel, jet fuel, gas, office supplies) fires in air is about 1,900 °F. As the old saying goes where there is smoke there&#39;s fire and where there are temperatures exceeding 2000°F the are self oxidizing incendiaries.</p>

<p>Just another piece of evidence proving explosives and incendiary devices destroyed the 3 WTC towers not kerosene and office supplies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couple of things... I think you have your temps confused. The max burn for most hydrocarbons using pure oxygen is 3000c, that is 5432f.</p>

<p>I&#39;m looking at the burn temp of fuels right now.. and there are lots of hydro-carbons that burn much hotter than 1900f. Acetylene, for example, can burn at ~4352f.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/flame-temperatures-table-607307">https://www.thoughtco.com/flame-temperatures-table-607307</a></p>

<p>But that isn&#39;t really relevant, the max burn temp of jet fuel isn&#39;t either... because jet fuel was the kindling. The building and everything in it was the fuel.</p>

<p>What is important here is the fire didn&#39;t get hot enough to melt steel, but it got plenty hot enough to weaken and disrupt the structure. Temps of ~650c would have been enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have nothing confused. You are confusing adiabatic flame temperature with atmospheric flame temperature. Without digging into the thermodynamics the two values are very different. Everything at the WTC site was burning in air.</p>

<p>I know the max temp of jet fuel (kerosene) flame isn&#39;t the necessarily the critical value which is why used the general term hydrocarbon. The fuel in the buildings (paper, furniture, carpet, etc) is almost entirely hydrocarbons.</p>

<p>Finally I said nothing about the melting of steel. I could go on four an hour about how the Bazant piledriver mechanism of collapse is totally against the laws of physics but today I just wanted to focus on the fact that temperatures were on multiple occasions recorded as much higher than what is physically possible in the conditions the US government claims existed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m imaging the many offices with their closed metal file cabinets full of paper spontaneously bursting into flames and explosively turing concrete and steel into dust. In other words, I am laughing at your silly theory. </p>

<p>If all of their metal wrapped paper was fueling the destruction of the concrete and steel, then how did so much of it end up on the street completely unburned? </p>

<p>No file cabinets were found, only a few small parts. For a girl who has dated more than one physical scientist, that whole idea just makes me want to laugh hysterically. That is NOT how the real world works. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>2,400 °F is achievable in an insulated furnace that is fed with forced air. It is not achievable in open atmosphere. This is why kitchen pots don&#39;t melt over the natural gas burners on a stove. </p>

<p>Forced air is the key. The collapsed towers burned until December 2001 and that shows a fuel with it&#39;s own oxidizer (thermite...) was present. Atmospherically oxidized fuels (jet fuel, office supplies) don&#39;t burn agressively underground. They consume all the oxygen and either go out or smoulder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Semi-related question. I saw a video the other day about some mound of stones that had been treated with some kind of energy source so as to make the surface of stones fuse together, one side of the mound more than the other.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what kinds of rocks and mortar it was made of, but I think we could assume some sandstone, quartzites, etc. The maker of the video was postulating that some ancient prehistoric culture had a technology of fuzing stones with high heat in order to fortify the otherwise unimpressive structure. I&#39;m not so sure. </p>

<p>I was wondering if it might have a far more natural explanation. Like lets say it was the foundation for a wooden castle with an extensive wooden city built all around the outside of it. A city that was destroyed in a great fire. </p>

<p>Could that create a fire hot enough to melt the surface of some types of stones if there was a good breeze stoking it? I was just wondering. I think a town fire is a lot more likely to have happened than any advanced technology like lasers, etc. with neolithic people. I don&#39;t think they were doing that advanced tech stuff, but I do think they were building lots and lots of buildings out of wood. Can wood burn hot enough to melt the surface of rocks? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on the type of minerals. But yes, wood can burn hot enough in open air to melt some of them. Although this is unlikely to happen accidentally on a large scale due to the amount of heat a large rock formation could absorb.</p>
