<p>A) Facebook memes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The DNC emails dominated right and left-leaning social media from the time they were released until the election. There was a top post on TD claiming that the DNC emails contained direct evidence that they had had Scalia assassinated. PG was predicated almost entirely on emails from the DNC leak. Pro-Sanders subreddits were also overrun with DNC email posts. It would be completely delusional to diminish the power that hack wielded in energizing Trump supporters and splitting dem. voters.</p>

<p>A dump of RNC emails would have yielded the exact same response. Even Kellyanne Conway was talking about how horrible Trump would be as president before he was nominated. You know RNC emails would be rife with people complaining about and criticizing Trump. It would have had nearly the same effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think he will admit it, but clearly his point is that Americans deserve to have lost their democracy as payback for stuff previous generations did. (Most of the terrible stuff the US did to interfere with other elections was done in the 1940s - 1980s. The one truly massive exception is the invasion of Iraq, which ranks as a terrible crime. But it still doesn&#39;t mean I should be happy I no longer have a vote that counts in our elections because of Russian military intelligence rigging elections for Republicans.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No,  his point is that its hypocritical for americans to go into hysterics over alleged Russian rigging when they have spent decades doing their own rigging (or worse,  like violent regime changes). Its like the school yard bully coming crying to the principal because someone stole his lunch money.  </p>

<p>And the US is guilty of tons of plenty of foreign interference in recent years. Libya had the highest standard of living in Africa before we helped our European allies turn the country into a terrorist infested open-air slave market in 2011.  At this very moment,  the US is helping Saudi Arabia commit genocide against the people of Yemen with the aim of re-installing the Saudi friendly dictatorship that was overthrown in 2011. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US intervened in foreign elections at least 81 (known) times from 1946-2000,  and obviously a few more since then.  </p>

<p>Irans involvement in Syria means nothing,  they have been close allies to Assad for decades.  Saying that Iran has been meddling in Syria is like saying that the US has been meddling in Israel.  Irans may have some involvement in Yemen,  so I will give you that one.</p>

<p>Also the US overthrew the first democratically elected Iranian govt in order to re-install their old dictator,  all because the new govt wanted to nationalize their oil instead of letting BP continue to take it.  As far as I know,  Iran has never attempted to overthrow the US govt.</p>

<p>So thats 81+ interventions versus just 1, on top of overthrowing their democracy for a west-friendly dictatorship... yeah I think Irans complaints are a little more justified than ours.  </p>

<p>FFS read the title of this thread. How are you going to complain about whataboutism in a thread where the discussion is supposed to be about comparing reactions toward US and Russian sponsored meddling.  </p>

<p>Anyway,  the term &quot;whataboutism&quot; isnt some Harry Potter spell that magically waves away all the atrocities of the US establishment.  You can choose to ignore the US long history of foreign interference,  but I this this kind of historical context is important for examining this situation in a rational way.  </p>

<p>If you think the extent of the attack on our election by Russian military intelligence was Facebook memes, you are woefully uninformed. I would suggest you try to familiarize yourself with the truth. I realize it&#39;s not easy, especially if you are a conservative, and all your news sources are garbage.</p>

<p>Yes, those things are awful. So are you content now to live in a country without free and fair elections? You think that is the deserved fate of 300 million Americans and we should just shut up and be happy about it and let Russia continue getting their puppets elected to our government?</p>

<p>Lol yes, it was the Russians. Totally not a push back against the unelected elites who comprise the EU.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the downing of Malaysian flight MH17 by a Russian anti-air unit (not rebels like the original story),</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Relied exclusively on intelligence by the Ukrainian SVU.</p>

<p><a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2016/09/28/troubling-gaps-in-the-new-mh-17-report/">https://consortiumnews.com/2016/09/28/troubling-gaps-in-the-new-mh-17-report/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The key conclusion of the Dutch-led criminal inquiry implicating Russia in the 2014 shootdown of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 relied heavily on cryptic telephone intercepts that were supplied by the Ukrainian intelligence service and were given incriminating meaning not clearly supported by the words.</p>

<p>The investigators also seemed to ignore other intercepts that conflicted with their conclusions, including one conversation that appeared to be referring to a Ukrainian convoy, not one commanded by ethnic Russian rebels, that was closing in on the Luhansk airport, placing Ukrainian troops deep inside rebel territory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The JIT video report on the MH-17 case, which was released on Wednesday, also didn’t address questions about the location of several Ukrainian Buk missile batteries that Dutch (i.e. NATO) intelligence placed in eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014, the day that MH-17 was shot down. A findingfrom the Dutch intelligence service, MIVD, released last October, said the only high-powered anti-aircraft missile systems in eastern Ukraine at that time, capable of bringing down MH-17 at 33,000 feet and killing all 298 people onboard, belonged to the Ukrainian military, not the rebels.</p>

<p>Although the location of the Ukrainian Buk systems would seem to be crucial to the investigation — at least in eliminating other suspects — JIT operates under an agreement with the Ukrainian government that lets it veto the release of information. Ukraine’s SBU intelligence service, which represented the Kiev government in the JIT, also has among its official responsibilities the protection of secret information that could be damaging to Ukraine.</p>

<p>or the recent assassination attempt on Montenegro&#39;s PM? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I must have missed this actually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Novichok poisoning in the UK?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean the sloppy false flag, considering Russia had literally no motive? Skripal was held in Russian prison for yeatsy, and was actually let go as part of a trade.</p>

<p>Novichock is not exclusive Russian chemical - Iranians successfully reproduced them years ago.</p>

<p>And it just so happens the poisonings occurred just 20 miles from Porton Down.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are plenty of other examples of recent Russian antagonism that have nothing to do with the US. Their behavior should not be downplayed. You don&#39;t need to trust American politicians to know that. </p>

<p>All of your examples are terrible and are not even true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about the fact that their entire stated goal in the Foundation of Geopolitics is to destroy us and our reputation with the world. How many times do I have to keep posting this to dipshits who think Russia isn&#39;t our enemy?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics</a></p>

<p>In <em>Foundations of Geopolitics</em>, Dugin calls for the influence of the United States and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanticism">Atlanticism</a> to lose its influence in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia">Eurasia</a> and for Russia to rebuild its influence through annexations and alliances.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</a></p>

<p>The book declares that &quot;the battle for the world rule of [ethnic] Russians&quot; has not ended and Russia remains &quot;the staging area of a new anti-bourgeois, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Americanism">anti-American revolution</a>&quot;. The Eurasian Empire will be constructed &quot;on the fundamental principle of the common enemy: the rejection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanticism">Atlanticism</a>, strategic control of the USA, and the refusal to allow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism">liberal</a> values to dominate us.&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#cite_note-dunlop-9">[9]</a></p>

<p>Military operations play relatively little role. The textbook believes in a sophisticated program of subversion, destabilization, and disinformation spearheaded by the Russian special services. The operations should be assisted by a tough, hard-headed utilization of Russia&#39;s gas, oil, and natural resources to bully and pressure other countries.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#cite_note-dunlop-9">[9]</a></p>

<p>The book states that &quot;the maximum task [of the future] is the &#39;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finlandization">Finlandization</a>&#39; of all of Europe&quot;</p>

<p>In Europe:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany">Germany</a> should be offered the de facto political dominance over most Protestant and Catholic states located within Central and Eastern Europe. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaliningrad_oblast">Kaliningrad oblast</a> could be given back to Germany. The book uses the term &quot;Moscow–Berlin axis&quot;.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#cite_note-dunlop-9">[9]</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France">France</a> should be encouraged to form a &quot;Franco–German bloc&quot; with Germany. Both countries have a &quot;firm anti-Atlanticist tradition&quot;.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#cite_note-dunlop-9">[9]</a></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> should be cut off from Europe.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#cite_note-dunlop-9">[</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine">Ukraine</a> should be annexed by Russia because &quot;Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics&quot;. Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordon_sanitaire">cordon sanitaire</a>, which would be inadmissible.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#cite_note-dunlop-9">[9]</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>In the Middle East and Central Asia:</p>

<ul>
<li>The book stresses the &quot;continental Russian–Islamic alliance&quot; which lies &quot;at the foundation of anti-Atlanticist strategy&quot;. The alliance is based on the &quot;traditional character of Russian and Islamic civilization&quot;.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran">Iran</a> is a key ally. The book uses the term &quot;Moscow–Tehran axis&quot;.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#cite_note-dunlop-9">[9]</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The book emphasizes that Russia must spread Anti-Americanism everywhere: &quot;the main &#39;scapegoat&#39; will be precisely the U.S.&quot;</p>

<p>In the United States:</p>

<ul>
<li>Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke &quot;Afro-American racists&quot;. Russia should &quot;introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolationism">isolationist</a> tendencies in American politics&quot;.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#cite_note-dunlop-9">[9]</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The Eurasian Project could be expanded to South and Central America.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finlandization">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finlandization</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a> foreign policy experts consistently feared that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe">Western Europe</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan">Japan</a> would be Finlandized, leading to a situation in which these key allies no longer supported the United States against the Soviet Union. The theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagoning">bandwagoning</a> provided support for the idea that if the United States was not able to provide strong and credible support for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-communism">anti-communist</a> positions of its allies, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a> and the U.S.–Japan alliance could collapse.</p>

<p>However, foreign policy scholars such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Nordlinger&amp;amp;action=edit&amp;amp;redlink=1">Eric Nordlinger</a> in his book <em>Isolationism Reconfigured</em> have argued that &quot;a vision of Finlandization in America&#39;s absence runs up squarely against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe">European</a> states&#39; long-standing Communist antipathies and wariness of Moscow&#39;s peaceful wiles, valued national traditions and strong democratic institutions, as well as their size and wherewithal&quot;.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finlandization#cite_note-5">[5]</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am very aware of what the <em>Foundations of Geopolitics</em> is. It is the go-to for people who have only a casual understanding of today&#39;s geopolitics. Dugin and similar philosophers are <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/03/17/letting-russia-be-russia/">generally misunderstood.</a></p>

<p>It is absolutely laughable if you think that it has more significance in the West than Edward Bernays&#39; <em>Propaganda</em>. <a href="https://www.countercurrents.org/baroud190807.htm">He is literally where &#39;public relations&#39; comes from.</a> The CIA uses his philosophies in their propaganda efforts. <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/meet-edward-bernays-master-of-propaganda/">Corbett Report has an excellent episode on this.</a></p>

<p>Here is the first paragraph of <em>Propaganda</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>THE conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.
      We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society.
      Our invisible governors are, in many cases, unaware of the identity of their fellow members in the inner cabinet.
      They govern us by their qualities of natural leadership, their ability to supply needed ideas and by their key position in the social structure. Whatever attitude one chooses to take toward this condition, it remains a fact that in almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons—a trifling fraction of our hundred and twenty million—who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind, who harness old social forces and contrive new ways to bind and guide the world. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody is claiming Russia doesn&#39;t have active clandestine operations in the US. That is a given. Every other country does as well.</p>

<p>The leap of logic I see <em>every single time</em> is &quot;Look! A Russian philospher outlines things that have happened in the West and the US! Therefore, Russia is behind all of this!&quot; This &quot;makes sense&quot; if you know little to nothing about the history of these countries and of institutions like the UN and NATO. He certainly outlines the breaking up of the EU and other isolationist movements, but such events are more of a push back against the unelected elites who comprise the EU. Instead of wrestling with this fact, people blame the Russians instead.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/beyond-racism-xenophobia-brexit-supporters-reject-eus-neoliberal-anti-democracy-empire/218064/">https://www.mintpressnews.com/beyond-racism-xenophobia-brexit-supporters-reject-eus-neoliberal-anti-democracy-empire/218064/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>British voters bravely rejected a profoundly undemocratic, neoliberal EU, which is perceived as placing the interests of the financial elite ahead of the needs of ordinary citizens. Indeed, despite the claims of international media and numerous “intellectuals,” the British referendum result has nothing to do with racism or xenophobia. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same thing in the US - the push back that resulted in Trump is a symptom of the rot in our system. It had <em>nothing</em> to do with the Russians.</p>

<p>The rest of your point regarding &quot;Finlandization&quot; is fearmongering over the <em>Soviet Union</em>. Do I need to remind you that it fell over 20 years ago? I hope not.</p>

<p>I will ask you a question that I hope you can answer without hesitation. How many conflicts in the last 20 years has Russia started, and how many conflicts have been started by NATO and its allies? Hint: Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Ukraine.</p>

<p>Has the West broken its explicit promise to Russia in the &#39;90s that they will not move an inch to the East? Yes or no?</p>

<p>What I find especially amusing is your point that the US will become a &quot;scapegoat.&quot; Poor, poor, US. They only contributed to the murder of literally millions of people and the displacement of millions more in the last 20 years. But it HAS to be the Russians that are behind the resentment building against the US!</p>

<p>THE MUELLER INDICTMENT</p>

<p>Something For Everyone: Mueller Indictment a Boon for Partisan Status Quo</p>

<p>The bipartisan support Mueller’s appointment received is even more telling given that he is the definition of a Washington insider. The power elites across the political spectrum seemed to trust him to, above all, protect their position at the head of the table.</p>

<p>by Whitney Webb</p>

<p>February 22nd, 2018</p>

<p>By Whitney Webb Whitney Webb </p>

<p>WASHINGTON – Last Friday, depending on which side of the partisan divide one was watching from, President Trump was either vindicated or his treacherywas confirmed. The impetus for these seemingly disparate reactions was Robert Mueller’s indictment against 13 Russian nationals, the latest and largest indictment to result from his investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. However, over the nine months that Mueller’s investigation has been active, it has continuously grown from its original purpose of investigating Russian collusion, expanding to include the business dealings of Trump and his inner circle with countries ranging from Qatar to China, meaning that the probe is no longer expressly about Russian collusion.</p>

<p>The drift of focus from its original purpose — as well as its failure to produce any connection between the Trump campaign, the Russian government, and the leaks of DNC and John Podesta’s emails — has led critics who place themselves outside of the left-right paradigm to treat this latest indictment with skepticism. Not only that, but concerns have been raised that the real purpose of Mueller’s probe is much more subtle and nefarious than publicly admitted and that it may itself be a threat to American democracy.</p>

<p>One such critic is Daniel McAdams, political analyst and executive director of the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity. McAdams, in an interview with MintPress News, stated that the Mueller indictment “has something for everybody,” explaining the strikingly different reactions from the establishment left and right. However, McAdams noted that the indictment was especially helpful to the “entire political class in Washington,” which may now “continue with its Cold War 2.0 project” without interference from anyone in favor of normalizing U.S.-Russian relations. In addition, McAdams warned that the recent indictment is likely to have a “chilling effect on the First Amendment,” also a boon to those elements of the political elite that seek to limit the acceptable range of debate on U.S. foreign policy.</p>

<p>A “show” indictment with something for everybody</p>

<p>The indictment released last Friday really did have “something for everybody,” as McAdams noted. The indictment itself details an effort by Russian nationals to “defraud the United States impairing, obstructing and defeating the lawful functions of the government […] for the purpose of interfering with the U.S. political and electoral processes.”</p>

<p>The establishment-left widely praised the indictment as the indictment asserted that the Russians charged “were instructed […] to use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump […]),” lending support the one of Clinton’s many “What Happened” narratives. The establishment-right was similarly pleased, as it “put Russia on notice.”</p>

<p>The president and his supporters also applauded the indictment because it showed no evidence of collusion with the Trump campaign, and crowed that the current administration had been vindicated of the accusation that Trump and/or his campaign had knowingly worked with a foreign government to alter the outcome of the election.</p>

<p>Read the Internet Research Agency Indictment</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/internet_research_agency_indictment.pdf">https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/internet_research_agency_indictment.pdf</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Partisan politics aside, there are many interesting facets of the indictment that have largely been glossed over by the mainstream press. Chief among these is the fact that no evidence was presented that shows that the Russian nationals were acting at the behest of the Russian government. They were foreign nationals who, as some have pointed out, were making internet memes and social media groups prompted by an economic motivation as opposed to having been motivated by a Russian intelligence operation to interfere in the U.S. political process.</p>

<p>Furthermore, journalist Adrian Chen, who in 2015 investigated the so-called “Russian troll farm” at the center of the indictment, has notedthat its operations were unsophisticated and “ineffective,” and that its employees “have a bare grasp of the English language.” Also noteworthy is the fact that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein noted that the “troll farm’s” efforts did not affect the outcome of the 2016 presidential election, buoying Chen’s claims of the group’s ineffectiveness.</p>

<p>In addition, none of the 13 Russian nationals named in the indictment will ever face trial in the U.S. — meaning that Mueller and his team will never need to prove their case against them, as the evidence laid out in the indictment will never be scrutinized in a legal setting. Thus, the American public is unlikely to ever know if this recent indictment is fact-based or not. As McAdams pointed out, “prosecutors often lie and they may be lying here.”</p>

<p>Other criticisms of the indictment include the fact that, of the ads and social media campaigns allegedly produced by the Russian nationals, many were aired after the election and 25 percent were never seen at all — while some included content promoting Hillary Clinton, progressive causes like Black Lives Matter and even puppies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When in doubt invoke muh fake news and Russian propaganda. Here is another for you then, snowflake.</p>

<p><a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2018/02/24/the-mueller-indictments-the-day-the-music-died/">https://consortiumnews.com/2018/02/24/the-mueller-indictments-the-day-the-music-died/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p> But the indictment landed with a decided thud for three reasons:</p>

<p>—  It failed to connect the Internet Research Agency (IRA), the alleged St. Petersburg troll factory accused of political meddling, with Vladimir Putin, the all-purpose evil-doer who the corporate media say is out to destroy American democracy.</p>

<p>—  It similarly failed to establish a connection with the Trump campaign and indeed went out of its way to describe contacts with the Russians as “unwitting.”</p>

<p>—  It described the meddling itself as even more inept and amateurish than many had suspected.</p>

<p>After nine months of labor, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller thus brought forth a mouse.  Even if all the charges are true – something we’ll probably never know since it’s unlikely that any of the accused will be brought to trial – the indictment tells us virtually nothing that’s new.</p>

<p>Yes, IRA staffers purchased $100,000 worth of Facebook ads, 56 percent of which ran afterElection Day.  Yes, they persuaded someone in Florida to dress up as Hillary Clinton in a prison uniform and stand inside a cage mounted on a flatbed truck.  And, yes, they also got another “real U.S. person,” as the indictment terms it, to stand in front of the White House with a sign saying, “Happy 55th Birthday Dear Boss,” a tribute, apparently, to IRA founder Yevgeniy Prigozhin, the convicted robber turned caterer whose birthday was three days away.  Instead of a super-sophisticated spying operation, the indictment depicts a bumbling freelance operation that is still giving Putin heartburn months after the fact.</p>

<p>Not that this has stopped the media from whipping itself into a frenzy.  “Russia is at war with our democracy,” screamed a headline in the Washington Post.  “Trump is ignoring the worst attack on America since 9/11,” blared another.  “…Russia is engaged in a virtual war against the United States through 21st-century tools of disinformation and propaganda,” declared the New York Times, while Daily Beast columnist Jonathan Alter tweeted that the IRA’s activities amounted to nothing less than a “tech Pearl Harbor.”</p>

<p>All of which merely demonstrates, in proper backhanded fashion, how grievously Mueller has fallen short.  Proof that the scandal had at last overstayed its welcome came five days later when the Guardian, a website that had previously flogged Russiagate even more vigorously than the Post, the Times, or CNN, published a news analysis by Cas Mudde, an associate professor at the University of Georgia, admitting that it was all a farce – and a particularly self-defeating one at that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last October, Facebook’s newsroom reported that 10 million people in the U.S. saw the ads. The report also states that only 44 percent of the ad impressions occurred before the election, meaning that the majority happened after. Furthermore, roughly 25 percent of the ads were never shown to anyone. Later that month, Facebook told Congress that 126 million Americans had seen “divisive content” posted by “Russian agents.” Ads are not specified, nor do we know what is specifically meant by “divisive.” Still, even on the high side, by Facebook’s own admission, the IRA posts were equivalent to 1 in 23,000 of Facebook’s posts.</p>

<p>As former Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein pointed out in a recent MSNBC interview, the fact that her campaign got a mention or two in these Russian ads “compared to trillions of ads on Facebook” just doesn’t even “pass the laugh test.” The idea that those who did see or click those ads were thereby swayed to vote against Clinton doesn’t pass the laugh test either. Rob Goldman, vice president of ads for Facebook, wrote in a thread on Twitter earlier in February: “I have seen all the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was <em>NOT</em> the main goal.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Speaking of which, it’s worth noting that not all of the Russian’s click-baity posts were a success. The Jesus Trump vs. Satan Clinton got a mere 71 impressions and 14 clicks. The creepy and colorful Bernie only garnered 848 impressions and 54 clicks. Meanwhile, a recent post featuring a Noam Chomsky quote on a page that I co-manage has more than 2,000 impressions (even though the page is relatively small). A paint company got more than 100 million impressions for heteronormative posts about paint color names. I never saw the paint ads, and chances are good that you didn’t either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue isn&#39;t a foreign government trying to sway elections. That isn&#39;t good, but it happens and should be defended against.</p>

<p>The issue is a candidate actively working to help them do it. Personally I don&#39;t think that is the truth. I think it is even worse (and stupider than that). I think that Trump is simply so narcissistic that he can&#39;t admit someone helped him across the line and so he&#39;s willing to deny everything about Russia just so he can say to himself &quot;I won fair&quot;. I really do think all the guilty behaviour comes down to one narcissistic old man rather than conspiracy.</p>

<p>That being said this sub was infiltrated by pro Russian pro alt right a couple of years ago. People trying to fight back agains that idiocy isn&#39;t people infiltrating the sub. It&#39;s trying to get it back to its roots. You know, being about conspiracies rather than 24/7 trying to deny them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you think memes swayed the election for trump? You know the voter participation rate was pretty low. I am a volunteer polling place inspector and hardly anyone came to vote. The republicans were more motivated. People didn&#39;t want Hillary, lots of democrats didn&#39;t even show up to vote.

    <div class="md"><p>I have no idea if it swayed the election for Trump. I&#39;d say the announcement that they were looking into Clinton again probably did sway it, considering how close it was but Comey would have been crucified by Republicans if he didn&#39;t announce that. (Still doesn&#39;t make it right, but whatever).</p>

<p>Either way I don&#39;t know if Russia had a large impact. It wouldn&#39;t have taken much, but maybe they didn&#39;t. I agree with all your points about Republicans being more motivated but there are also many fewer of them so even if Republicans were more motivated they could have still lost.</p>

<p>My point is that if someone said to Trump you got 52% of the vote, and without Russia&#39;s help you would have gotten 51% he&#39;d tell you that is fake news and say that he actually got 55% of the vote all by himself.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how narcissists are. They are compulsive liars that can&#39;t deal with reality so they make up their own. Trump has been doing it for decades. I think more people need to understand that. He might not have committed a single crime. He might just be such a narcissist that he&#39;s going to look guilty because he doesn&#39;t want to admit it wasn&#39;t ALL him.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all I was saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So Trump lost the popular vote because of large urban centers like NY and LA?   Duh?  The popular vote is based on people.  Most people reside in cities.  LA and NY are very large cities.  You said that voter turnout was low (it wasn&#39;t), people didn&#39;t like Hillary (she received more votes than Trump), people weren&#39;t motivated (voter turnout was similar to the previous elections).  </p>

<p>Not sure why you brought up the electoral college, but do you think citizens in states like Wyoming or the Dakodas should have MORE say in the election vs NY or CA due to the unbalanced electoral college votes states have in relation to their voting age population (WY being over represented in the EC and NY underrepresented)?   Do states with few people in them deserve MORE say in our elections than places that are home to the most people?</p>

<p>Do you know there were only 5 times (out of 57 elections) that the EC went against the popular vote, and only 2 of those times were within the last 125 years (2000, and 2016), which helped elect (arguably) two of the worst Presidents our our history.</p>

<p>Wyoming gets more than 3 times the EC representation (based on their population) compared to NY (EC of Wyoming is about 5.13 EC votes per million people vs NY 1.46 EC votes per million).  Does this sound equal to you?  Hint:  It&#39;s not.</p>

<p>Huh?  From your link, it showed that Democrats came out more than Republicans did.  Turnout for both groups was down from 2012 numbers.  But, if you look at later reports, shows that turnout numbers went up and were similar to 2012.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very simple.  People have the right to vote.  Not land masses, not counties, not states.  People.  So saying &quot;millions of people in one area&quot; should not have as much influence as &quot;thousands of people in different area&quot; doesn&#39;t make much sense, does it?  </p>

<p>It&#39;s no mystery why conservatives love to flout that color coded county voting map, where it shows the US all red except for small &quot;pockets&quot; of blue. Makes it look like the whole country is conservative and those Democrats are cheating or something to win elections.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahahaha the lack of intelligence people display in threads about Trump is astounding. I&#39;m a true Patriot. I know when my country fucks up and when to stand up for it. There&#39;s nothing to defend in this context. You&#39;re getting patriotism confused with nationalism. Most people ignore or are unaware of the US&#39;s true (fucked up) history. Therefore, people assume this Russian collusion thing is legit. Maybe it was, maybe it isn&#39;t. But what&#39;s for sure is that the US (mainly the CIA) has been meddling in foreign elections and overthrowing democratically elected leaders since the late 1940s/early 1950s and now that it&#39;s happening to us we&#39;re freaking out? I don&#39;t think so. It&#39;s actually only fair that someone else gets a chance. And not even that, to think Russia is that influential enough to sway our elections is actually a nod to Russia. They might have had a small impact but no one talks about Israel&#39;s influence. Get fucked. </p>

<p>What should Americans do if it is true?</p>

<p>Surely you, as a proud Patriot, wouldnt want to throw up your hands and say, &quot;We deserve it, come and get us, we are so bad, manipulate our foreign policy from within to better suit Russia, its only fair&quot;</p>

<p>You dont mean that do you? Dont you, as a true Patriot, think we should shore up our cyber defenses, sanction the offending country, and protect our interests?</p>

<p>Even if they DIDNT do it shouldnt we shore up our vulnerabilities anyway? Bringing up things we did in our past does nothing for the country.</p>

<p>The sports analogy is tired but constantly appropriate. You arent a hypocrite for playing defense while simultaneously trying to score on the other team. Its the game. If you dont play defense you lose.</p>

<p>You, as a true Patriot, dont want America to lose do you? Because it seems like you do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think America could afford to lose one, yeah. Does that mean I want Russia to win? No. I&#39;m a US citizen, born and raised, and I want nothing more than to get the fuck out of here. We&#39;re a corporatocracy/oligarchy. 98% of our politicians (not leaders) are bought and sold out. Their interests are in making money and helping their rich friends make money. I would much rather live in New Zealand or Japan or one of the 20+ statistically better (economic and personal freedom) countries that exist. The US is #1 in wealth which only goes up to the &lt;1% and prisoners per capita. We&#39;re not the best country and we haven&#39;t been for a long time. There are a lot of changes that could be made to bring us back to that point but there are too many brainwashed people that would interrupt any sort of progress in that direction. The US is doomed to fall. I, personally, can not change anything but myself. It&#39;s a fruitless effort to try to change such a corrupt system. The best I can do is take care of myself, be self-sufficient and independent of any govt need, and speak up against the bullshit when and where I can. </p>

<p>What does it have to do with the massive Russian campaign to get Trump elected? </p>

<p>Are you saying that Americans should now just shut up and be happy that our democracy was subverted, because our government did the same to others decades earlier?</p>

<p>I thought the purpose of those years we spent criticizing the us government for interference abroad was to say those things were bad. They were violations of peoples&#39; rights and democratic values.</p>

<p>I did not think the purpose was to justify other countries doing it to us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d bet if Hillary could get more democrats to the polls she would have won. Tons of democrats didn&#39;t vote for president. Trump had a more support among independents, which outnumber either party. You can believe some wild msm conspiracy theory, or you can actually look at what happened. Most independents supported either Bernie or trump. When Bernie got ficked over by the dnc, many independents who previously supported Bernie voted trump in protest. Hillary couldn&#39;t motivate enough democrats and independents to vote for her so she lost. Most millennials didn&#39;t even vote, it was like 15-20% participation rate for that group. When you look at the actual facts the whole Russian conspiracy seems ridiculous </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not real democracy unless the people are able to choose their own candidates. Not to mention, the dnc said over and over again that they support all candidates equally. Not to mention, Bernie caucuses with the democrats for a long time before 2016. Also, he created the progressive caucus which is one of the largest and most powerful caucuses in congress. So, your position is that it doesn&#39;t matter how corrupt the dnc is because they can do whatever they want. And, that&#39;s the point of view the dnc takes as well. You wonder why Hillary lost, it&#39;s because of massive corruption within the dnc, voters read the emails and saw it for themselves and because of that corruption, Hillary lost. But, has the dnc taken a lesson from rigging the primaries and losing to trump as a consequence? Hell no they haven&#39;t </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly agree with you. But they have all been corrupt. Trump is an easy target due to his own actions, yes. But this fascism didn&#39;t start with him and it would appear he&#39;s opposed to it.</p>

<p>What else would explain the vast majority of media opposed to him? I&#39;ve never seen anything quite like this in fact and it&#39;s dangerous, it should strike fear that some 90% or more of the media is in cooperation about this? Meanwhile, bush put us into two misleading wars, one of which produced ISIS and the opposition to him was never quite like this.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not an apologist for Trump, I don&#39;t even subscribe to the left-right nonsense.</p>

<p>But I will say this. Even if Trump is a dumbass, the American people are all upset and angry over the wrong things.</p>

<p>Where is it written that a party is only allowed one candidate for presidency? Where is it written there can be only two parties? Or that a 3rd is rarely allowed into debates? Why is it okay the media doesn&#39;t push for more candidates? Why aren&#39;t more people angry about that?</p>

<p>Where is the wrath aimed at the system failing all of us? This isn&#39;t a problem we will be able to vote out of. And what will be the next choices? A scumbag or a goblin witch again? Why do I feel I&#39;m the only one upset about that?</p>

<p>Why do I need to talk to trump-haters and explain to them they should be upset that there weren&#39;t more choices? That it&#39;s the foundation of the problem we need to address instead of it&#39;s symptoms. Why isn&#39;t anybody upset that corporations can donate undisclosed amounts of money to a candidate since 2012? You realize how dangerous that is, yes?</p>

<p>And yet the only thing I ever see is an ego-driven, fake moral high ground anti-trump crap siting &#39;racism&#39; and &#39;hate speech&#39; or whatever other dumbass shit?</p>

<p>Btw, we are very likely in agreement about everything. But trump isn&#39;t the problem. He&#39;s a symptom of the problem.</p>

<p>Have to disagree there, I firmly believe Trump would be a ok with being a straight up dictator and playing King for the rest of his life. He&#39;s only opposed to fascism if he can&#39;t call the shots. </p>

<p>Bush was a shitbag war criminal but he was presidential. He didn&#39;t stoke the fire like Trump does and was capable of the basic job requirements. Most of the negative press Trump brought upon himself, <em>including</em> the Russian &quot;narrative&quot;.</p>

<p>They benefit from the current system so they won&#39;t ever attack it. I&#39;ve hated the two party system my entire life but it&#39;s what we&#39;re stuck with unfortunately and as long as we are I&#39;d prefer not to have a complete buffoon at the helm. </p>

<p>You&#39;re not the only one, I completely agree with that. Until they get the money out of politics things will remain fucked. That&#39;s the only way forward and if it doesn&#39;t happen America will become something else, I actually think it already has personally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do agree with what you&#39;re getting at. The problem is, that I and actually anyone I would consider to be on the left side (not American liberal &#39;left&#39;) have always seen and criticize the US for what it is. The real left has always been counterculture to (american) imperialism. Now as it is in a political landscape that is strongly manufactured by the principle of &#39;divide et impera&#39; some will reflexively think I must be a communist or condone Soviet imperialism, but I don&#39;t. </p>

<p>So the problem with downplaying what Russia does is that, while I actually wouldn&#39;t mind a (r)evolutionary process that transforms government bodies of the world to something that actually benefits all of humanity, that the russian government is just the same flavour with even more evil and less freedom. It gaining influence in the world is a big step back. If you look at world history, progress is a fucking slow grind and most real world social changes take generations to take hold, because there has always been action and counteraction. yada yada</p>

<p>What I basically want to say: I see the irony in it, when the establishment of the most powerful nation in history, that meddled all over the world goes crazy about losing at their own game. But it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a good change just because someone else is doing it this time.</p>

Mitrione also was in Brazil when Goulart was overthrown in a CIA-sponsored military coup in 1964; he was in the Dominican Republic the following year when its government, too, was overthrown.  Then he moved onto Uruguay where he was kidnapped and killed in 1970 by the Tupamaros rebels.  </p>

<p>In a University of California (Berkeley) professor&#39;s article (written by, IIRC, Mark Danner[Spelling?]), the Uruguayan Police Commissioner For Information said that Mitrione introduced &quot;<em>systematic</em> torture&quot; to Uruguay, training Uruguayan &quot;security&quot; officers.  Daniel Mitrione used to be a small-town police chief in Indiana before becoming involved with the CIA.  While working for CIA through USAID, he also hosted &quot;educational&quot; conferences for Latin American &quot;security&quot; officials at the International Police Academy in Washington, DC.  Some of these officials also received explosives training in an abandoned Texas town apparently to instruct them in the use of explosives for political assassination and for false flag events.</p>

<p>Costa-Gavras&#39; films never disappoint.  I mentioned his film <strong><em>Z</em></strong> a while back if anyone cares to watch some good films.  <strong><em>Betrayed</em></strong> was another good one.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s Wiki&#39;s article on CIA officer Dan Mitrione: </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Mitrione">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Mitrione</a></p>

<p>From the article:</p>

<p>&quot;A. J. Langguth, a former <em>New York Times</em> bureau chief in Saigon, Vietnam, claimed that Mitrione was among the U.S. advisers teaching Brazilian police how much electric shock to apply to prisoners without killing them.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is up with people on this sub trying to act like Russia is not a salient problem? Your title only has one sentence about Russia but you&#39;ve found a way to jam-pack it with falsehoods. It&#39;s more than a dozen Russians, there&#39;s an entire agency in Russia with thousands of members (the internet research agency, look it up) who are STILL ATTACKING OUR DEMOCRACY. And the multiple agents that actually came to America, they did way more than just meme, they actually organized protests and actively went out into the real world to infiltrate and volunteer for the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>The fact you feel a need to call out Russia as not a problem in a post that has nothing to do with Russia shows that you have a bias, and its a bias that someone else is putting in your head. Who&#39;s the real sheep here?</p>

<p>In order for you to believe that Russia is not a problem you actually have to ignore facts. You have to create an entirely false conception of what Russia is doing to interfere in our democracy, where the only thing is happening is that they are just posting some news stories online. It&#39;s much more than that. They&#39;re impersonating American&#39;s using proxies, they&#39;re hacking into our institutions and election systems, they&#39;ve come onto US soil and organized protests.</p>

<p>Who even brought up illegal immigration? Illegal immigration is what is going to destroy America? American history has been full of hucksters that use fear of immigration to scare people who don&#39;t know any better into voting for them. You don&#39;t need a conspiracy to show that.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is that if a powerful person is trying to make you scared about immigrants, it&#39;s not because he cares about your safety, it&#39;s because he wants your money. If you have any doubts about that I&#39;d read-up more on American history.</p>

<p>to be honest with you Russia changed my vote. I didn&#39;t vote for Trump, but I also didn&#39;t vote for Hilary, because of the Uranium One conspiracy. It was a theory started by Russians at the IRA and disseminated through wikileaks. I didn&#39;t even look into the theory until after the election to find out that it&#39;s all bullshit.

    <div class="md"><p>How about the fact that their entire stated goal in the Foundation of Geopolitics is to destroy us and our reputation with the world. How many times do I have to keep posting this to dipshits who think Russia isn&#39;t our enemy?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics</a></p>

<p>In <em>Foundations of Geopolitics</em>, Dugin calls for the influence of the United States and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanticism">Atlanticism</a> to lose its influence in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia">Eurasia</a> and for Russia to rebuild its influence through annexations and alliances.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</a></p>

<p>The book declares that &quot;the battle for the world rule of [ethnic] Russians&quot; has not ended and Russia remains &quot;the staging area of a new anti-bourgeois, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Americanism">anti-American revolution</a>&quot;. The Eurasian Empire will be constructed &quot;on the fundamental principle of the common enemy: the rejection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanticism">Atlanticism</a>, strategic control of the USA, and the refusal to allow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism">liberal</a> values to dominate us.&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#cite_note-dunlop-9">[9]</a></p>

<p>Military operations play relatively little role. The textbook believes in a sophisticated program of subversion, destabilization, and disinformation spearheaded by the Russian special services. The operations should be assisted by a tough, hard-headed utilization of Russia&#39;s gas, oil, and natural resources to bully and pressure other countries.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#cite_note-dunlop-9">[9]</a></p>

<p>The book states that &quot;the maximum task [of the future] is the &#39;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finlandization">Finlandization</a>&#39; of all of Europe&quot;</p>

<p>In Europe:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany">Germany</a> should be offered the de facto political dominance over most Protestant and Catholic states located within Central and Eastern Europe. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaliningrad_oblast">Kaliningrad oblast</a> could be given back to Germany. The book uses the term &quot;Moscow–Berlin axis&quot;.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#cite_note-dunlop-9">[9]</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France">France</a> should be encouraged to form a &quot;Franco–German bloc&quot; with Germany. Both countries have a &quot;firm anti-Atlanticist tradition&quot;.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#cite_note-dunlop-9">[9]</a></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> should be cut off from Europe.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#cite_note-dunlop-9">[</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine">Ukraine</a> should be annexed by Russia because &quot;Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics&quot;. Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordon_sanitaire">cordon sanitaire</a>, which would be inadmissible.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#cite_note-dunlop-9">[9]</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>In the Middle East and Central Asia:</p>

<ul>
<li>The book stresses the &quot;continental Russian–Islamic alliance&quot; which lies &quot;at the foundation of anti-Atlanticist strategy&quot;. The alliance is based on the &quot;traditional character of Russian and Islamic civilization&quot;.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran">Iran</a> is a key ally. The book uses the term &quot;Moscow–Tehran axis&quot;.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#cite_note-dunlop-9">[9]</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The book emphasizes that Russia must spread Anti-Americanism everywhere: &quot;the main &#39;scapegoat&#39; will be precisely the U.S.&quot;</p>

<p>In the United States:</p>

<ul>
<li>Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke &quot;Afro-American racists&quot;. Russia should &quot;introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolationism">isolationist</a> tendencies in American politics&quot;.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#cite_note-dunlop-9">[9]</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The Eurasian Project could be expanded to South and Central America.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finlandization">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finlandization</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a> foreign policy experts consistently feared that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe">Western Europe</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan">Japan</a> would be Finlandized, leading to a situation in which these key allies no longer supported the United States against the Soviet Union. The theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagoning">bandwagoning</a> provided support for the idea that if the United States was not able to provide strong and credible support for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-communism">anti-communist</a> positions of its allies, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO">NATO</a> and the U.S.–Japan alliance could collapse.</p>

<p>However, foreign policy scholars such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Nordlinger&amp;amp;action=edit&amp;amp;redlink=1">Eric Nordlinger</a> in his book <em>Isolationism Reconfigured</em> have argued that &quot;a vision of Finlandization in America&#39;s absence runs up squarely against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe">European</a> states&#39; long-standing Communist antipathies and wariness of Moscow&#39;s peaceful wiles, valued national traditions and strong democratic institutions, as well as their size and wherewithal&quot;.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finlandization#cite_note-5">[5]</a></p>

<p>wow, they managed a 20 year low voter turnout. Looks like the democrats stayed home because hillary sucks ass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Huh?  From your link, it showed that Democrats came out more than Republicans did.  Turnout for both groups was down from 2012 numbers.  But, if you look at later reports, shows that turnout numbers went up and were similar to 2012.</p>

<p><a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/324206-new-report-finds-that-voter-turnout-in-2016-topped-2012">http://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/324206-new-report-finds-that-voter-turnout-in-2016-topped-2012</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>the whole point of the electoral college is so high population centers don&#39;t have more influence than rural areas, what do you not understand about that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s very simple.  People have the right to vote.  Not land masses, not counties, not states.  People.  So saying &quot;millions of people in one area&quot; should not have as much influence as &quot;thousands of people in different area&quot; doesn&#39;t make much sense, does it?  </p>

<p>It&#39;s no mystery why conservatives love to flout that color coded county voting map, where it shows the US all red except for small &quot;pockets&quot; of blue. Makes it look like the whole country is conservative and those Democrats are cheating or something to win elections.  </p>
