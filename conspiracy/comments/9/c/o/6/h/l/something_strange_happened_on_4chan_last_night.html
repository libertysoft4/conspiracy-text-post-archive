        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, a gentleman dropped by 4chan and was dropping links for an 11GB file of documents.</p>

<p>Some anons DL&#39;d the file and started combing through it...and what they found was...very interesting, to say the least.</p>

<p>This guy says he&#39;s the son of a jeweler, and was involved in the diamond trade in DRC. At some point, an organization called the Five Point Trust got him involved in trying to recover 15 Trillion dollars. There&#39;s a ton of documents related to the CIA&#39;S involvement in the drug trade (implicating HW Bush extensively, among others) and the banking-arm of an extensive, world-wide CIA operation. It traces an extensive banking history going back to the 1920s....Operation Hammer supposedly has to do with a hidden network of literally inconceivable amounts of money being transferred international. Shit goes back to stolen Nazi gold....there&#39;s a bunch of SWIFT transaction documents.</p>

<p>BUT</p>

<p>I looked into this gentleman, and he kinda appears to be a wacko. Aussie guy. Says he&#39;s a member of the &#39;galactic government&#39; (which he just made up), cosmic disclosure, zero point energy, yada yada. I&#39;m not super versed in that particular &#39;disclosure&#39; community, but some anons are saying he sounds like some of the discredited people that exist within that community. However, he&#39;s articulate, concise, and lucid when he speaks. The concepts here are just crazy...aliens, suppressed technology, septillions of dollars, etc. </p>

<p>BUT</p>

<p>Here&#39;s one of the things from the drop....a recording of him sort of drunk-dialing the CIA and yelling at them (which is kind of hilarious on it&#39;s own). What&#39;s interesting to me is that a) the agent he speaks to seems to take him seriously, b) the agent drops full names of CIA assets (may get in trouble for that one, yah?) c) at one point another guy gets on the line and says he&#39;s family friends with the Bushes and his family has worked for the CIA for decades. They seem to know who he&#39;s referring to, who he&#39;s talking about....at one point the guy says &#39;well, you know, it&#39;s all run by secret societies&#39;.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the call: <a href="http://seenine.x10host.com/disclose/CIA%20Assets/CIA%20Clancey%2025.6.18.wav">http://seenine.x10host.com/disclose/CIA%20Assets/CIA%20Clancey%2025.6.18.wav</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s the original 4chan thread where this was dropped: <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/184397285">https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/184397285</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a current 4chan thread going discussing it: <a href="http://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/184430023">http://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/184430023</a></p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I truly don&#39;t know what to make of this, guys. I ain&#39;t about to DL a 11GB file, but shills are out, and some of this stuff looks legit/interesting, if perhaps unbelievable in it&#39;s scope. Would love someone with a more sophisticated background to take a gander at some of the screen-shots people took on 4chan and speak to their possible validity.</p>

<p>This is like a conspiracy-theorist&#39;s wet dream...also seems to confirm some of the random internet chatter that something big is going on behind the scenes. I live by the motto &#39;if it seems too good to be true, it probably isn&#39;t&#39;, but I dunno...what do you guys make of this?</p>

When they asked if he was in Melbourne they kept stalling and it seemed like they were scrambling to pull files or locate, then they started shouting out names to find connections. As soon as it went into energy developments the line cut before the agent was about to spill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, if these things are true, if the major governments and intelligence agencies have constant contact with various extraterrestrial groups (from benevolent to non-benevolent/selfish), if a plenitude of underground military research facilities exist in order to reverse engineer their technology, as well as create new independent tech, if there are trillions of dollars involved in such a secret space program,...who would ever believe the witnesses coming out with their info anyway? Unless they had hard evidence, in which case they would likely immediately be eliminated (and the evidence would be labelled fake).</p>

<p>To most people this stuff sounds like a fairy tale, right? Although none of this is beyond the scope of actual possibility, the likelihood of something like this taking place behind the scenes seems marginal at best, right? At least most people would have this perspective, I&#39;d say.</p>

<p>Yet if this is in fact true, if these various whistle-blowers, people discussing extraterrestrial involvement, exotic technologies being suppressed...if these people are telling the truth or at least a partial truth (the slice of information they even know themselves - since if this is true rare people probably know the whole story), then they could yell as loud as they can, yet nobody would ever believe them. They could bring photos, even videos and people would say its all doctored, photo-shopped. </p>

<p>As long as this is so unbelievable, those hiding these activities would likely have no problem with the whistleblowers, since nobody would believe them anyway even if they said something - and if any of them had an extremely incriminating video of such a facility, they would be likely be killed instantly.</p>

<p>I actually wonder though... even if these people presented some very hard evidence for their claims, in the form of pictures and especially videos (since there are already many pictures of extraterrestrials, yet nobody can tell you whether they are photoshopped or not, videos would be far better), would anyone actually believe this is happening? Most people would probably call it fake, no matter how much evidence is presented. </p>

<p>I personally do think there is something to these claims. I think even here there is a lot of misinformation and disinformation...but I&#39;d still say that the cover-up may go deeper than we are even willing to entertain...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Off topic, but my town had a full blown ufo/uap sighting Saturday. Very clearly visible whitish orbs. I mention this because it was amazing how fast everyone accepted a joke discrediting the orbs being weather balloons tracked on an app as the obvious truth. This all took place on the community Facebook page and within two hours the local paper&#39;s website was mentioning the weather balloon story. Nothing to see here, problem solved, aren&#39;t we all so silly. The joke screen shot put the balloons in the wrong spot in the sky relative to the various towns where people said they also saw the unidentified aerial phenomenon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I&#39;m fired up about my first ever sighting. These orbs must have been very high altitude as when lights from other craft that I&#39;m assuming were &quot;ours&quot; showed up, I couldn&#39;t make out the outline of what I&#39;m assuming was high altitude helicopters because they were able to hover. Our guys flanked then orbs, surrounding them, then over about 30 min, the orbs started sparkling and losing the structure of the visible outer ring as if they were being fired upon. I&#39;m a little surprised I didn&#39;t even think any of this was weird because I&#39;ve heard/read of this stuff before.</p>

<p>Also, wealth is a weird measure at conspiratorial levels that this story would be talking bout.</p>

<p>Assume you do have a secret massive breakaway civilization or even just a completely other level of society that the common reality people are unaware of. What does human wealth get you? Pretty much only seems to be able to buy things in this realm of economic reality...</p>

<p>I would assume that there is a massive breeding of slaves required to maintain some ridiculously massive secret civilization...</p>

<p>But if there is not some civilization like this, then the mumdane depressing truth may just simply be that humans are inherantly selfish hoarders of resources and we do have just a few extremely rish and powerful people ruling all the worlds resources - and it just a crazy game played by them at that level, but if youre ingenious enough to figure out how to get onto the playing field, you can have your go for a time. Bezos and zuck are two relatively recent entrants... but given their paper wealth is what we talk about, and thats single digit percentages of the rothschilds supposed fortune, they arent a threat to the upper levels, they are just fresh opponents in the game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, if these things are true, if the major governments and intelligence agencies have constant contact with various extraterrestrial groups (from benevolent to non-benevolent/selfish), if a plenitude of underground military research facilities exist in order to reverse engineer their technology, as well as create new independent tech, if there are trillions of dollars involved in such a secret space program,...who would ever believe the witnesses coming out with their info anyway? Unless they had hard evidence, in which case they would likely immediately be eliminated (and the evidence would be labelled fake).</p>

<p>To most people this stuff sounds like a fairy tale, right? Although none of this is beyond the scope of actual possibility, the likelihood of something like this taking place behind the scenes seems marginal at best, right? At least most people would have this perspective, I&#39;d say.</p>

<p>Yet if this is in fact true, if these various whistle-blowers, people discussing extraterrestrial involvement, exotic technologies being suppressed...if these people are telling the truth or at least a partial truth (the slice of information they even know themselves - since if this is true rare people probably know the whole story), then they could yell as loud as they can, yet nobody would ever believe them. They could bring photos, even videos and people would say its all doctored, photo-shopped. </p>

<p>As long as this is so unbelievable, those hiding these activities would likely have no problem with the whistleblowers, since nobody would believe them anyway even if they said something - and if any of them had an extremely incriminating video of such a facility, they would be likely be killed instantly.</p>

<p>I actually wonder though... even if these people presented some very hard evidence for their claims, in the form of pictures and especially videos (since there are already many pictures of extraterrestrials, yet nobody can tell you whether they are photoshopped or not, videos would be far better), would anyone actually believe this is happening? Most people would probably call it fake, no matter how much evidence is presented. </p>

<p>I personally do think there is something to these claims. I think even here there is a lot of misinformation and disinformation...but I&#39;d still say that the cover-up may go deeper than we are even willing to entertain...</p>

<p>What I HATE is hoaxers... There are so many hoaxers it makes any real investigation super difficult. </p>

<p>I propose that if any alien life has been here it is in very low quantities, mostly I find it unlikely life is super common in our back yard and no one has showed up in significant numbers.</p>

<p>Take the primitive villagers on islands, even though they are totally isolated from the modern world they’ve still had random sailers and explorers show up (and attacked them). They certainly know other people exist, even if they can’t comprehend our technology.</p>

<p>With earth, if there were trillions of aliens zooming around in space that all reasonably had a means to get here I feel like we’d get a few outlaws/explorers to show up and say hello... even if whatever authority exists says it’s illegal. So:</p>

<p>-I think it’s most likely that we’re the only intelligent life in our solarsystem in any large numbers.</p>

<p>-Other planets might have microbial life due to panspermia, but likely earth-originating</p>

<p>-Other hyper-advanced species could have their version of “voyager” monitoring us, but this is impossible to know.</p>

<p>-if advanced life has visited us, it’s probably extra-solar, outside our local cluster, and has only come in very very small numbers due to the extreme cost of travel or distances involved.</p>

<p>-the above lends support to the idea that our government has not made official contact, or if they have that it is minimal. If we were regularly trading with them then it must be reasonably easy to get here for them... and therefore a political dissident or outlier would likely visit us on the whitehouse lawn.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s lots of research currently being done that is going to help narrow down the possible explanations for subjective experience.  If there are really hard spatiotemporal constraints on the way that matter needs to be arranged for subjective experience to emerge, then it means that a simulation won&#39;t have subjective experience unless it&#39;s running on computer <em>hardware</em> that for all intents and purposes is just another brain.  This dependence on physical matter forbids the sort of multi-layered simulation-within-simulation-within-simulation that is an assumption in Bostrom&#39;s simulation hypothesis.  The most you could ever do is a brain-in-a-jar simulated reality via hijacking the sensory input to the brain, ala the original Matrix movie.</p>

<p>The jury is still out. The alternative, if all you need is some minimally complex abstract system to generate subjective experience, then the implications are a bit horrifying, but they&#39;re also so absurd that I doubt this is the case.  People taking the extreme functionalist position wind up arguing that a brain simulated with paper and pencil by hand would have some sort of experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s a good point.  I think the idea of aliens visiting is ridiculous.  What are the odds that there is an alien race that not only visits us, but is only a little more advanced than us?  Because really, they would have to be a little more advanced.  If they 5 billion years more advanced than us, we wouldn&#39;t even know they were here.  We wouldn&#39;t even be able to comprehend it.  And if they were less advanced than us, then obviously they wouldn&#39;t be able to travel here.  Even if they were 1 million years more advanced than us (a tiny amount in the big scheme of things) we still wouldn&#39;t have any idea they were here.  So the whole idea is predicated on the ridiculous notion assumption that in a universe billions of years old, there&#39;s an alien race who not only took exists, and not only took an interest in us, but is in a nearly identical point in evolution and intelligence as us.  How fucking convenient.  Talk about 1 in a trillion.  </p>

<p>Why? Because you’ve seen it in movies? </p>

<p>Outside of hollywood there is basically no evidence for anything being able to traverse time. There’s not even any theoretical physics that suggests it’s possible once we get xyz.</p>

<p>That said, there is no experimental evidence for faster than light travel either. However at least with FTL there is a fundamental way to do it in existing physics... we just lack the energy/exotic matter.</p>

<p>There <em>is</em> however experimental evidence life exists, and in great number and diversity. It is logical to assume if so much life exists here it must exist elsewhere on the hundreds of billions of planets in our galaxy. And like you said, any intelligent life just a few million years ahead of us would be crazy advanced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait until all that AI stuff is widespread and easily accessible by criminals (and by criminals I mean the elite) we&#39;re going to be completely fucked. People are sitting around thinking all the spying infrastructure being set up right now is no big deal and it&#39;s just for &quot;advertising&quot;. It&#39;s worse than 1984, Orwell didn&#39;t even imagine that computers could impersonate people and alter perception, and that one network could track and datamine practically everything on the planet. We need laws to stop the spying and planned mind control. It&#39;s literally mind control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to see it at least examined more. Seems like people are glancing at it and making determinations without checking out some of the actual documents.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an unredacted FBI report detailing how the CIA put together a 5-person team to take over the entire drug game:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/175648354/Five-Star-Trust-Origins-FBI-Redacted-Report">https://www.scribd.com/document/175648354/Five-Star-Trust-Origins-FBI-Redacted-Report</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Scanned a few pages. I&#39;m not so quick to dismiss. </p>

<p>For example, there have been many rumors of Bush Sr and Bill Clinton running drugs out of Mena, Arkansas.</p>

<p>I thought it was hogwash when I first heard it.</p>

<p>But the dang rumors just won&#39;t go away. </p>

<p>Then when you realize our government has been run by a criminal syndicate since at least Bush Sr, with either a Clinton or a Bush in the White House since Reagan&#39;s days, well it makes you wonder.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like this: Bush -Bush-Bush, Clinton-Clinton, Bush-Bush, Obama (Clinton) - Obama (Clinton). And it would have been Clinton-Clinton again. </p>

<p>In a way, it really was her turn: her turn as a member of the crime syndicate to have a turn at presidency.</p>

<p>And would go far toward explaining why certain people were so upset Trump won: he vowed to drain the swamp.</p>

<p>They were the swamp.</p>
