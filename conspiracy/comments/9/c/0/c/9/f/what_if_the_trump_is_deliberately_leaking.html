<p>The leak favours Trump because Trump is already very critical of the media. A media company leaking sensitive material to a different country really undermines the credibility of the media. Could Trump have intentionally have done this in order to make his anti-media stance even more popular?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is about to learn that there is a big difference between scratching your ass and tearing it off and that Canadians are only very nice, polite, and laid-back people, as long as you don&#39;t try fuck them around and if they have to bite the bullet in order to inflict some serious pain for that condescending insult by Trump and seeing that his negotiations are actually a sham, you can rest assured that those Canadians will and will demand it from their government and without any complaints about any negative effects on them if that&#39;s how it&#39;s going to be.</p>

<p>They know they got a raw deal on NAFTA and up until now were just as sympathetic with all the Americans that it turned-out to be a losing proposition for, too. The very people Trump courted in order to get elected. The idea of re-doing NAFTA was to ostensibly make it fairer to those it harmed on BOTH sides of the border which was what the vast majority of Canadians believed the initiative was aimed at doing.</p>

<p>If this is Trump&#39;s way to try help those Americans out at Canada&#39;s expense after putting the Mexicans between a rock and hard place just to stay in a game that put them into the dire straits they&#39;re already in, he&#39;s in for a rude awakening. </p>

<p>It will be a better deal or no deal and Canadians will create a better situation for themselves both internally and internationally with China and the EU in particular and anyone else that wants to climb on board and get into that if there isn&#39;t one.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The three hundred billion dollars worth of goods and materials that US depends on Canada for and the 285 billion that Canadians buy in goods from the US is nothing to sneer at and there is a distinct difference between what is traded between the two. </p>

<p>Canadian exports consist primarily of materials that will be turned into finished goods and products by producers and manufacturers in the US which Canadians then purchase as imports coming back from the US.</p>

<p>Trump has decided to take issue with that 15 billion dollar difference despite the fact that it fluctuates from year to year and the US has been on the upside just about as many times as Canada has over the duration of the agreement. </p>

<p>Meanwhile the US has 375 billion dollar trade deficit with China, your so-called largest trading partner who only buys 130 billion dollars in goods and products from the US.</p>

<p>You tell me which of those two is more important to US manufacturers and all of the people employed in manufacturing in the US? </p>

<p>Does the US buy any oil, natural gas, or electricity from China? How about wood pulp for US paper mills? How about iron ore for the making of steel? Did you know that Canada produces more of it that US does and that the US uses more than it can mine itself? Where do you think the rest of it comes from?</p>

<p>I can see by the comments here that very few understand the actual nature of the relationship that exists or that the US actually has more to lose in a dispute with Canada than Canada does. Or that the US is by any means in the driver&#39;s seat in terms of what it <em>needs</em> rather than simply <em>wants</em> from Canada, the same, however, can&#39;t be said about Canada or Canadians who both have and can find other sources for what they purchase from the US.</p>
