    <div class="md"><p>I get that where one gets cash can be logged ans tracked, but how do they track spending in cash? </p>

<p>Seems to me that they can only tell where one got their cash from, but it is nearly impossible to track as there are no serial numbers directly associated with any given individual and they would have to sift through and log all the cash in a given area to find the specific bills associated with an individual. I&#39;m pretty sure they aren&#39;t doing this to the masses, I could be wrong though.</p>

Food for thought**</p>

<p>They want you to believe that there is no such &#39;end&#39;, that we&#39;ve been here for &#39;billions&#39; of years, like the guy mentioned; well, it makes perfect sense that you don&#39;t believe that the &#39;end&#39; is near if they have you believing that we&#39;ve been here for billions of years..</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny how the most popular theorized end year to date has been &#39;2012&#39;. It was very popular due to its many reasons for its claims, however, it did not occur on the the exact date to our gregorian calendars and we all just chucked the idea into the bin &amp; made it something to laugh about.. I did too..</p>

<p>The times we are currently living in which is so close in proximity to 2012, is almost picture perfect in circumstances as theorized by many, prophesizing the end times.. I mean that&#39;s pretty crazy in itself if you think about it, especially if you believe that we&#39;ve been here for billions of years..  </p>

<p>What are odds of both of those aligning so closely? </p>

<p>What are the odds that the date truly is &#39;2012&#39;, just that our calendars are off by some years/decades?</p>

<p>Now, ofcourse we can&#39;t validate the latter for obvious reasons but just looking at it as it is, I&#39;d lean towards the former being more improbable, especially considering we&#39;ve been here &#39;billions&#39; of years..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, according to &#39;science&#39;, we&#39;re a mere speck floating in infinite w/ an unsummable amount of comets and meteors floating randomly in space which are 100s of times bigger than our planet, any close contact then its the end of civilization. </p>

<p>If we survived then all it means is that it wasn&#39;t Big enough a cataclysm to wipe us out, not because the last of us form some cataclysm-proof impenetrable cocoon around us like you&#39;re making it sound..   all your ideas are based on past experiences and hypothetically, if the end had past then there would be no argument as to whether there can be an &#39;end time&#39;, therefore it&#39;s redundant. +via your logic, it&#39;s still has to happen in somebody&#39;s lifetime.</p>

<p>Your argument doesn&#39;t refute anything; All you&#39;re saying is, &#39;it didn&#39;t happen in all those people&#39;s lifetimes therefore you&#39;re arrogant because you think you&#39;re special because you singled yourself out &#39;1/10000xx&#39;.</p>

<p>Well, guess what?? This isn&#39;t a lucky draw..that&#39;s not how it works.</p>

<p>Frankly, it was just a humble brag assuming people are arrogant for speculating and quite egotistical to come here and just do that whilst providing 0 refutations other than your own opinions which is again, based on the past and as i said, this is not a lucky draw.</p>

<p>The things runnin through your mind and imo I&#39;m sure the majority of us has had those those thoughts.. it&#39;s rudimentary.</p>

<p>***Anyways, I don&#39;t really believe in all that tbh, e.g. Humanity&#39;s extinction via meteors etc; it&#39;s just an argument I felt aligned more w/ your pov because this &#39;you think you&#39;re special because it&#39;s going to happen in your lifetime&#39; narrative has zilch to do w/ what op is addressing regarding the world being in turmoil &amp; NWO taking over which were predicted far back..</p>

If one is aware of monitoring then provide that information that presents the Monitors with exactly the portrait you want the Monitors to see. Not everything in society has to be done while connected, do those things that you don&#39;t want the Monitors to know without carrying a phone, use proxies and VPNs, know how to cover discernible physical features without looking like you&#39;re doing so. We don&#39;t have to resign ourselves to defeat and oppression because the tech <em>seems</em> overwhelming. If we&#39;re aware of it, we can use it to our advantage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think to call us serfs is to ignore reality of what historical serfdom was, and that our standard of living is inconceivable to anyone born before the 20th century on all counts- access to info, life expectancy, availability of food and clean water, freedom to travel, etc. </p>

<p>Yes most people work for the man, and there is an overlord class that pulls the strings, but I just think that this talk of slavery and ownership turns conspiracy discussions into hysterics that push others away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s bizarre how people don&#39;t see how big of an issue it is. They only see little pieces to a really big puzzle, so they assume it isn&#39;t all that bad. The more you put the pieces together, the more you&#39;ll see that you are not free. And probably never will be. I think it&#39;s hard for most people to wrap their head around that because they live like they&#39;re free. It&#39;s an illusion though ! ! ! </p>
