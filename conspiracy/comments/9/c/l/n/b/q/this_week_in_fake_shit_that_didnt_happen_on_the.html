        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You can&#39;t make this shit up.</p>

<p>Well, actually I guess you can, because they did.</p>

<p><a href="https://bgr.com/2018/08/31/international-space-station-leak-meteorite/">https://bgr.com/2018/08/31/international-space-station-leak-meteorite/</a></p>

<p>There it is. An astronut saves the day -- again -- by plugging a hole in the space station with his thumb.</p>

<p>Amazing how no one has died up there in nearly 20 years.  Good thing the &quot;vacuum of space&quot; didn&#39;t destroy them after a hole was put in their space station traveling at about 17,000 mph.</p>

<p>Some will notice that this ridiculous story seems to be based on the &quot;little hero of Holland&quot; tale, where a Dutch boy plugs a leaky dike with his finger until help arrives, popularized in the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Brinker,_or_The_Silver_Skates"><em>Hans Brinker.</em></a>.</p>

<p><strong>But here&#39;s the thing.</strong> Look at the photo Chris Hadfield posted of the hole that was repaired. See how it is marked with official NASA labels, like all their official photos?</p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s the same picture as the album cover of this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_(album">2014 contemporary Christian album</a>).</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing the excuses put forth by the eternally faithful to the government organization called NASA.</p>

<p>For the unbiased observer, take note: this is why we distrust NASA and doubt the things they say they do and the places they say they go....  it&#39;s because they <em>unendingly give us pure bullshit, all the time, and constantly lie to us and mock us.</em> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The title of the article I posted, which is underneath that giant photo, reads something like &quot;astronaut aboard the ISS had to plug <strong>this</strong> hole with his thumb.&quot;</p>

<p>So I guess the way it was presented by Hadfield/NASA fooled even this &quot;science blogger&quot; who wrote the article I posted.</p>

<p>So in your view, a 2014 Christian rock band used an obscure photo from NASA&#39;s website of a hole in a satellite, on their album cover, then 4 years later, when a hole appeared in the ISS, NASA used the same photo used by the Christian rock band, to represent the hole, instead of a photo of the actual hole? That&#39;s a yes or no question by the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Answer the question: You think that what happened here was that Remedy Drive used the satellite hole photo in 2014 for their album cover, then NASA used the same photo to represent an actual hole in the space station four years later? </p>

<p>Like hopping on social media. You&#39;d think if they had time to log into twitter, they could have taken a picture of the actual hole an astronaut put his thumb over to stop the environment from leaking out. I wonder if social media would have liked to see that hole... nah throw a stock photo from Wikipedia up, they&#39;d eat it right up. </p>

<p>It was sent up in pieces over the course of many years. Those pieces docking with one another are very well documented moments. Similarly you can easily find videos of those pieces being manufactured and tested on earth before getting sent up. </p>

<p>Don’t be embarrassed though, it’s great that you are asking questions. As a scientist, I encourage everyone to ask questions. Just be careful not to fall down a rabbit hole as often the answers are a lot less complicated that you’d expect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s about time something happened up there. Nothing bad ever happens which can&#39;t be fixed by a fun space walk and some Gorilla glue.</p>

<p>In bed a couple nights ago, my HVAC unit was short-cycling and I couldn&#39;t go to sleep. Hearing the air come on and turn off every couple minutes, combined with the general stress of being alive, being an adult, stressed me to the point where I couldn&#39;t sleep. Got me thinking about how ridiculous it is to assume that these people are insouciantly floating around, smiling, describing their ludicrous and nebulous &quot;experiments,&quot; some of them with children back home, where their lives would be on a razor&#39;s edge. The psychological trauma caused by spending 5 minutes in such a dangerous situation would be such an adrenaline rush and intense experience that years would probably be taken from one&#39;s life, yet we are to assume that these people shower, shit, shave, and grow tomatoes up there while traveling at 17,000 mph.  What a joke. What an unbelievably absurd fairy tale that exposes itself by the very nature of its goofy theatrics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do they have the space debris that made the hole or did it puncture and bounce off?  </p>

<p>Also, the problem of decompression for a bullet sized hole in space had math done by Professor Andrew Higgins of McGill University and gives the following answer:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The air will leak through the hole at sonic velocity (Mach one at constriction of the leak).   </p>

<p>So, the mass flow rate is:  </p>

<p>dm/dt = rho V A  </p>

<p>where rho is density, V is velocity, and A is the area of the hole. The velocity equals the speed of sound (sonic orifice), but this is slightly lower than the speed of sound in the spacecraft cabin due to expansion of gas as it flows through the hole. Density is lower also. So, it is more practical to express the mass flow rate in terms of stagnation conditions, i.e., the conditions in the cabin, which I will denote po and To:   </p>

<p>dm/dt = A po Sqrt[ (g/(R To)) (2/(g+1))<sup>(g+1</sup>/(g-1))) ]  </p>

<p>here &quot;g&quot; is gamma, the ratio of specific heats (g = 1.4 for air) and R is the gas constant (R = 287 J/kg-K for air). You can find this derived in any compressible fluid dynamics textbook (or any fluids book with a chapter on compressible flow).   </p>

<p>For air, this simplifies to:   </p>

<p>dm/dt = 0.04042 A * po/Sqrt[To] &quot;Fliegner&#39;s formula&quot;  </p>

<p>If you stick to MKS units (use Pa for pressure and K for temperature), this will give you the mass flow rate of air leak in kg/s.   </p>

<p>So far, we have assumed that the spacecraft remains at the same po, To. Of course, as the leak progresses, the pressure in the spacecraft begins to drop, and this affects the mass flow rate through the leak. Thus, dm/dt is no longer constant, and we have to integrate the above differential equation coupled to the decrease in po and To as the spacecraft leaks. You can find the details of this in Saad&#39;s Compressible Fluid Flow (2nd Ed., pp. 103-106). The answer is that, to leak from an initial pressure of pi to a final pressure of pf, the time required is:   </p>

<p>t = 0.43 V [(pf/pi)<sup>-0.143</sup> - 1]/(A Sqrt[Ti])  </p>

<p>Again using MKS units, where V is the volume of the spacecraft (Ti = initial temperature), this gives you the time &quot;t&quot; to leak down to pf in seconds.   </p>

<p>This assumed that the blow-down was isentropic. In practice, any blow-down that will last tens of seconds to minutes, the process in the spacecraft is more likely to be isothermal: mass of spacecraft has huge thermal capacity compared to the (decreasing) mass of gas inside and will keep the gas warm as it expands. With the assumption of isothermal blow-down, the time required becomes:   </p>

<p>t = -0.086 V Ln[pf/pi]/(A Sqrt[T])  </p>

<p>where T is the (constant) spacecraft temperature.   </p>

<p>So, if your spacecraft has a volume V = 10 m<sup>3</sup> at 300 K with a 1 cm x 1 cm hole, the time it takes the pressure to drop from 1 atm to 0.5 atm is:   </p>

<p>t = -0.086 * 10 * Ln[0.5]/(1e-4 Sqrt[300]) = 344.2 s   </p>

<p>Or about six minutes.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>NASA claims the leak occurred overnight and into the morning. How is that possible?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Overnight and in the morning there was an abnormal situation—a pressure drop, an oxygen leak at the station,” Dmitry Rogozin of Russian space agency Roscosmos told reporters. “A micro fracture was found, most likely it is damage from the outside. The design engineers believe it is the result of a micrometeorite.”  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The atmosphere would have dropped significantly for that long a period. Near complete decompression.  </p>

<p>Um, because the ISS is not 10 m<sup>3</sup> in Volume and the hole was not 1 cm<sup>2,</sup> as you quoted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, if your spacecraft has a volume V = 10 m3 at 300 K with a 1 cm x 1 cm hole . . .</p>

<p>Put in the right figures:</p>

<p>t = -0.086 × <strong>931 m<sup>3</sup></strong> × ln(0.5) / (<strong>4 × 10<sup>-6</sup> m<sup>2</sup></strong> × √(300 K)) = 222 hours</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the record:</p>

<p>The point of this post is not the image of the hole, but of the fantastical nature of this obviously fabricated story which was contrived as window-dressing to mollify the multitudes of unfortunate people who still believe in the ISS hoax. </p>

<p>Let it be pointed out that NASA astronaut and ISS &quot;Commander&quot; Chris Hadfield <em>did indeed</em> tweet a photo that could easily be interpreted as a photo of the actual hole in question, and indeed from which the science blogger I linked to originally <em>did</em> infer that Hadfield was tweeting an image of this hole.</p>

<p>Do not think for one nanosecond (shoutout to Don Petit) that I did not expect some kind of sleight of hand damage control to serve as a pseudo-justification for this latest gaffe. Of course now it is said that the photo is of a hole in a satellite.... Hadfield merely was tweeting a photo (without clarification) to <em>represent</em> what a hole in the ISS <em>might look like,</em> etc. </p>

<p>This is nonsense of the nature which can be filed away under the &quot;petrified wood&quot; category, where any proponent of NASA must bend over backwards in their Sisyphean task of defending the agency&#39;s every misstep and anomaly -- plugging their holes, if you will.</p>

<p>So now we are seeing the damage control I already expected in real time.... There is an excuse for everything. There will always be.  If you want to believe that the Christian band Remedy Drive used this NASA stock photo in 2014, then Hadfield decided to use that same photo four years later to represent a hole in the ISS, which actually exists in orbit and contains astronauts in gorilla suits and football jerseys, this is your choice.</p>

<p>Look here <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SMM_panel_hole.jpg">SMM panel hole- 16:20, 15 November 2006</a> (Scroll down)</p>

<p>This NASA photo came out in 2006. The Christian album was released in 2014. </p>

<p>This post is blatantly false. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So have you come to believe that 9/11 and sandy hook are in fact conspiracies? Because the thing is, once someone wakes up to the real truth behind 9/11, it honestly makes more sense that the moon landing and the entire space programme is a hoax too. The way the US government operate starts to fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. Lies and deceipt on every level. A country that would murder its own citizens is not above worldwide deception, it should be expected from such an entity.</p>

<p>As for whether space is even real I honestly don&#39;t know anymore, I certainly can&#39;t say for certain myself. I would have to defer to an authority for answers and I certainly don&#39;t trust NASA. The moon landing being fake is not necessarily indicitive of a flat earth or space being fake. I would strongly recommend looking again at the fake moon landing argument, once you wake up to that there really is no reason to believe the ISS is perfectly legit. Why would they go clean after getting away with the biggest lie of all time?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no rational or logical link between 9/11 and the moon landings. The Space Race was a product of the Cold War, whereas 9/11 is the product of Zionist influence (everything that has happened post-9/11 appears to be to Israels benefit).</p>

<p>I have studied the moon landings in detail for many years, and I still nothing to indicate that it was anything other than that presented - using the latest technology of the time, and with astronauts who were exactly the right kind of men to risk their lives in such an undertaking, the US put men on the moon. </p>

<p>In those 8 years of huge spending and blossoming technology they progressed from launching unmanned satellites, then chimps, then humans in sub-orbital flights, then solo orbital flights, then 2 man missions where they practised EVAs and docking with other craft. Then they developed the world&#39;s most powerful rocket, and they flew to the Moon 3 times before they landed on it. Hardly the first try.</p>

<p>The special lander was destroyed? Huh? The descent stage was left on the moon&#39;s surface,as it had performed it&#39;s task, and the ascent stage was discarded once it had done it&#39;s job. Why bring it back to Earth when it couldn&#39;t survive reentry? </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny you should mention deep sea diving. Do you know when man first went to the bottom of the Marianas Trench, the deepest point of the world&#39;s oceans? 1960. Do yo know when someone did it again? James Cameron, the film director, in 2012. 52 years...</p>

<p>Do you not agree that we should start from a skeptical persepctive? Also what does all the missing evidence say to you exactly? Could you agree that NASA are least incompetent? The same organisation to lose the moon landing footage were the first people ever to get man out of low earth orbit?</p>

<p>The difference with the Mariana trench is there is actual evidence for the trip. So that one isn&#39;t exactly in question here. Also, the deepest point in the ocean is not nearly the same as 237&#39;000 miles to the moon. Not at all a fair comparison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone was incompetent but I would hardly call the whole organisation that.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with a healthy dose of scepticism, but I think you&#39;re going way beyond that. A blanket denial that something that was technically feasible, and that there is plenty of evidence to support happened, is hardly scepticism.</p>

<p>There is actual evidence that men walked on the moon, but you keep choosing to ignore it. And I would argue that it was more dangerous to dive to 10,911 metres underwater than go to the Moon, as at that depth if anything had gone wrong, especially a structural failure, then they would be dead instantly. At least they stood half a chance with Apollo 13. In fact, I think that there is more proof that we went to the moon than we went to the bottom of the ocean in 1960 - film, photos, samples, photos of the stuff they left behind on the moon, etc etc. </p>

So that&#39;s original video footage of Apollo 11, telemetry data and the moon landing technology. I would venture a guess that it was prrobably illegal to destroy those records.</p>

<p>Various anomolies with the footage. Here&#39;s the harnesses worn by astronauts seen on camera: <a href="https://youtu.be/Zz9Bzi_GyD0">https://youtu.be/Zz9Bzi_GyD0</a>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah this was the point of the post more than the image of the alleged hole, which of course has become a straw man that the shills are using to make a production of attacking that one aspect of this post so that no one discusses how silly and stupid the concept of the ISS is in the first place. </p>

<p>I intend to do another post soon which ties into this incident. If you look around you’ll notice that there is now much discussion of space debris and how it is postulated that due to an increasing amount of orbiting junk, and said junk colliding with itself until it becomes some kind of deadly dust/shrapnel. Some are saying now that it might prevent future manned space travel because of the danger! So this could very well be just a pseudo-justification for why space programs will cease their efforts to send people to space. It gives them a reasonable-sounding excuse to stop faking space missions. </p>

<p>I can’t find the article right now, but they used the same picture but clearly noted it was a “hole like the one in the picture” that they plugged, not necessarily the exact hole. </p>

<p>I think this is more of a case of overzealous reporting and trying to be the first to break news than any nefarious cover-up or conspiracy. </p>

<p>Unfortunately we’re seeing lore and more these days of “journalists” publishing stories on the internet without all facts so that they can break the news for clicks, credit, at whatever other reason. But how many times do those things get edited, corrected or taken down? All because they didn’t have all the facts and wanted to run with something. I think some dimwit saw the tweet, took the photo and didn’t do much research. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s about time something happened up there. Nothing bad ever happens which can&#39;t be fixed by a fun space walk and some Gorilla glue.</p>

<p>In bed a couple nights ago, my HVAC unit was short-cycling and I couldn&#39;t go to sleep. Hearing the air come on and turn off every couple minutes, combined with the general stress of being alive, being an adult, stressed me to the point where I couldn&#39;t sleep. Got me thinking about how ridiculous it is to assume that these people are insouciantly floating around, smiling, describing their ludicrous and nebulous &quot;experiments,&quot; some of them with children back home, where their lives would be on a razor&#39;s edge. The psychological trauma caused by spending 5 minutes in such a dangerous situation would be such an adrenaline rush and intense experience that years would probably be taken from one&#39;s life, yet we are to assume that these people shower, shit, shave, and grow tomatoes up there while traveling at 17,000 mph.  What a joke. What an unbelievably absurd fairy tale that exposes itself by the very nature of its goofy theatrics.</p>

<p>I have addressed the &quot;damage control&quot; nature of the response to this affair in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9clnbq/this_week_in_fake_shit_that_didnt_happen_on_the/e5bnagt/">this comment</a>.</p>

<p>The point of this post was to highlight the latest absurd story from the ISS, about a hole being plugged with a thumb, and how it beggars belief that this utter made-up nonsense is still readily accepted and defended by so many. The title of the post itself does not even mention the photo tweeted by Hadfield.</p>

<p>Do you think that the Christian band Remedy Drive used a stock photo from NASA for their 2014 CD and if so, why?</p>

<p>NASA claims the leak occurred overnight and into the morning. How is that possible?</p>

<p>Um, because the ISS is not 10 m<sup>3</sup> in Volume and the hole was not 1 cm<sup>2,</sup> as you quoted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, if your spacecraft has a volume V = 10 m3 at 300 K with a 1 cm x 1 cm hole . . .</p>

<p>Put in the right figures:</p>

<p>t = -0.086 × <strong>931 m<sup>3</sup></strong> × ln(0.5) / (<strong>4 × 10<sup>-6</sup> m<sup>2</sup></strong> × √(300 K)) = 222 hours</p>
