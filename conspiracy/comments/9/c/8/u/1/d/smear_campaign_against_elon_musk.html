<p>Sounds quite random, but when you look into the incident you&#39;ll see it was far more than meets the eye. The reasons those kids were in the cave, the reason they were rescued, <em>who</em> rescued them, and of course Elon&#39;s role and what he knew of the incident.</p>

<p>He fucked with forces far greater than himself and they&#39;re trying to put him in his place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The switch on Musk opinion has been a long time coming, even if it just hit you more recently.  <a href="/r/EnoughMuskSpam">/r/EnoughMuskSpam</a> has been around for a decent while, and ever since he amped up his twitter presence a few months ago he&#39;s been changing the opinion on himself by exposure.  Elon&#39;s always had a vocal fanbase, but their vocalness hid the shallowness of other parts of his support.  Probably some oil/short money being put in to anti-PR, but the trend still seems organic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck off with that bullshit. I have a long time friend who I&#39;ve known for decades and who I&#39;ve always considered intelligent. He got wrapped up in the flat earth nonsense (along with Christianity at the same time, just a coincidence, I&#39;m sure). I bought tickets for us to fly to Florida to see that launch, to settle the argument. It was the most awesome thing I&#39;ve ever witnessed. The launch was cool enough, but watching the two boosters scream back toward the ground and then refire just when it looked like they were going to slam into the Earth.. fucking awesome. There were thousands of people gathered at multiple viewing sights, plenty of indipendent video. It&#39;s not disputable. That shit happened, and I saw it with my own eyes.</p>

<p>Apart from that, go to <a href="https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/">https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/</a> You can see when the ISS will fly over you next. You can go outside and watch it, no telescope or binoculars needed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, there are absolutely paid firms who have been hired to smear nearly every major player in the business and political spheres. Musk&#39;s problem is that he has been giving them fuel to feed feed the flames. When you have that many well funded crosshairs fixed on you, you have to play it the way politicians do.. you need handlers who research everything you say and do publicly, and craft responses to anything that may come up. He hasn&#39;t done that, which is obviously commendable, but at the same time it exposes him to these sorts of attacks. He&#39;s human, just like the rest of us, and without a team of professionals crafting his image, flaws will be visible. </p>

People are getting sick of his brand of egotistical or elitist bullshit, from calling a guy a peado because he criticised him submarine to calling himself a socialist whilst being a union-busting  billionaire (also saying Marx was a capitalist cos he wrote a book about it). People are just now realising that despite funding some awesome stuff, the man himself is a fool.</p>

<p>Also to say he is a major threat to the fossil fuel industry is a bit of an exaggeration. Tesla is a small company and far from a run away success, whilst almost every major car manufacturer is already selling electric cars that are far more affordable than Tesla&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know there was a study on the environmental impact of the full manufacture of a Tesla. The car does use more energy to build, but it begins to break even pretty quickly. I cant find the source right now and I don&#39;t remember the details too well so take it with a grain of salt. I&#39;m definitely more optimistic than you about the benefits of electric cars, but it&#39;s good to be skeptical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That payoff is when you compare a brand new ICE car with a Tesla and even then it is 8 years. So the extra environmental impact of building a Tesla over an ICE vehicle is worth 8 years of the increased emissions from the ICE.</p>

<p>If you already own a car then it&#39;s even worse because the emissions from building a new one will outweigh a lifetime of savings from increased engine efficiency whether it is electric or ICE.</p>

<p>Obviously electric is the future of vehicles but buying an electric car is not good for the environment. Affordable public transport, cycle infrastructure and walking are the only eco alternative.</p>
