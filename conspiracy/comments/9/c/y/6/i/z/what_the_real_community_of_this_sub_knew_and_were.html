        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We knew their was a group of cooperating powerful people who had infiltrated all levels of government and media world wide. We had many names for them, illuminati, NWO, shadow government....</p>

<p>We knew their goal was world domination. They wanted to consolidate the world power into fewer hand to streamline control of the world. They wanted and were working towards dismantling america because america&#39;s system had checks and balances that restricted what they had planned for the world. They wanted a world government. Not necessarily only one government for the world, but in the sense that the UN has ultimate control of the countries within it. </p>

<p>We could see the steps they were taking to put the pieces in place for this agenda.    They were slowly a methodically creating the infrastructure for their system. We knew the current ponzie scheme currency system has run it&#39;s course and is ready for collapse. We knew they were going to have to use some big event as a catalyst for the transition into this new system.    This drove the prepper movement. Some thought is would be economic collapse. Some thought it would be UN troops disarming and rounding us up to put in FEMA camps. Some thought it would be a fake alien invasion (project blue beam).....</p>

<p>The previous politicians had all the infrastructure in place for the transition.  You could literally feel it coming. There was an anxiety in many that this was it they are going to make the big move any second. We had been researching and watching them put the pieces into place for so many years and it was at THE point.  </p>

<p>Then Trump runs for election. He is opposed strongly every second of the day by the illuminati. He runs on a platform that is opposite to the illumiati goals they have worked so hard for. </p>

<p>And all I can do is watch as exactly as you would expect happens now that their agenda has been screwed up. After decades of work you can hear the screams  NO!!!!! from every arm of their tentacles. You can see every branch of their alliance scrambling to work on a plan B. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man I thought you were going to make the point that everyone missed the fact that it was Trump and the people behind him and the same people behind Brexit who were the ones plotting to take over the world and dismantle the US, that they managed to convince the only group of people who knew something was up to support them in their endeavour instead of resisting them. Because that is what it really looks like to me. I think people are so naive for believing Trump is some savior thwarting the evil plans of the illuminati. Even if Trump thwarted the evil plans of some, it’s clear he and those behind him have some pretty evil plans of their own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t. Like I said it helped our corporate masters. </p>

<p>Regardless, you seem to be very ill informed on the TPP, being that the entire point of it was to <em>exclude</em> China. Because China is so unfair when it comes to labor, environmental regulations, and especially intellectual property, the TPP was created that would make it more appealing for American companies to instead build factories in allied nations. </p>
