    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m so disappointed every time I see this video.  Any time it comes up, all people want to talk about are the weird bits flying around.  They could be aliens, molten metal bits, debris, I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>But it glosses over what could be the most important discovery in the last century.  All they did was dip a tethered probe into the atmosphere a little way, and they accidentally(?) pulled out more electricity than they could handle.  It was so strong that it literally burnedthrough  their millions of dollars worth of equipment.</p>

<p>Unlimited, free, (relatively) easy to get power, and people only want to talk about alien particles...  Such a shame.</p>

Not some guy playing with magnets or house antennae.  Massive amounts of electricity, just by dangling a metal rope.  If they kept the tether a bit shorter, it would&#39;ve been a manageable amount, and the same effect could be extrapolated for a ground-up operation.</p>

<p>Or...  We could talk about yet another of hundreds of videos that show alien particles flying in straight lines.</p>

<p>Even this one is trimmed up pretty bad too, and has extra commentary, but you can see at least some of the buildup that led to the gradual electrical overload.  For some reason, I can&#39;t find the original, longer version, that shows the longer overview of the mission and what happened.  I hope YouTube didn&#39;t memory hole that one too...</p>

<p><a href="https://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wtether.html">https://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wtether.html</a></p>

<p>This source states the:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>February 25, 1996, began as planned, unrolling mile after mile of tether while the observed dynamo current grew at the predicted rate. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a fascinating phenomena and I&#39;m all for renewable energy sources... But how would this current even be used for applications on Earth&#39;s surface?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s one of the more bullshit explanations I&#39;ve seen from NASA (or its acolytes), and they spew bullshit on a regular basis.  They should&#39;ve just gone down to Home Depot, if their cables are so shit.  Not to mention that the entire tether was lit up, indicating that the resistance of the cable conductor across the entire length couldn&#39;t handle the amps going through.  The problem was that their cable wasn&#39;t conductive enough, for how long it was.  If they&#39;d gone half that length or less, maybe the amps would&#39;ve been manageable.  Can&#39;t really say, since NASA and the rest of our shit government doesn&#39;t care to investigate it further.</p>

<p>And there are a variety of experiments and applications that could be done with this.  Tethered drones, tethered high altitude towers over deep mines, perpetual orbit in satellites.  Cabled kites charging ground batteries.Those are just me spitballing.  I&#39;m sure that smarter people could come up with more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do like your ideas, but hat altitude needs to be obtained for this induction to work--can kites, drones and towers go high enough?  How would satellites transmit current back to the ground?</p>

<p>Your argument seems wildly speculative and you lost me at points .. home depot cable isn&#39;t going to fix pockets of oxygen in insulative material.</p>

<p>Do you have a video of the tether lit up with evidence it was due to current not sun light? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>that video gives the impression of looking into a microscope displaying pond water. Life, everywhere. It&#39;s also sort of interesting in that regard considering the old hypotheses that talked about light being transmitted through a &quot;trans-luminal fluid&quot; and the really old bits about the &quot;firmament&quot;...</p>

<p>What was the context of you seeing that donut-thing? The video makes them sort of look like jellyfish or something, although that could be just a the focus effect. </p>
