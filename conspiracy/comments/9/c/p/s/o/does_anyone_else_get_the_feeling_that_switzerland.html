    <div class="md"><p>Switzerland&#39;s neutrality was a front. It was hardly neutral. During WW2, it laundered huge amounts of money for both sides, allies and axis. Switzerland is Rothchild territory. If you go to Geneva, the Rothchild name is everywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could do some Googling, ya know?</p>

<p>Switzerland&#39;s neutrality in WWI was a very touchy issue.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm-Hoffmann_Affair">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm-Hoffmann_Affair</a></p>

<p>Also in WWII, there were extensive German plans to invade Switzerland because of the sheer amount of anti-Nazi rhetoric floating around. The Swiss militia was prepared to fight a war of attrition throughout the mountains. Switzerland was attacked by both sides and often fought off Luftwaffe raids.</p>
</div>

    <div class="md"><p>What I have always heard, and what your articles say, is that attacks on Switzerland were not purposeful, but accidental. The fact that they often happened near the border seems to confirm that hypothesis. I don&#39;t think the Swiss consider themselves to have ever been attacked.</p>
</div>

    <div class="md"><p>The Allied incidents were mostly accidents. But senior American commanders argued for bombing Switzerland as it was seen as a German sympathizer.</p>

<p>The Nazis violated Swiss airspace 197 times during the invasion of France. Saboteurs were sent to destroy airfields after the Swiss air force was ordered to stop intercepting trepassers and instead escort them to Swiss airfields.</p>
</div>

    <div class="md"><p>So Switzerland was not attacked by both sides then, but some Allied commanders wanted it to be attacked (because they thought it wasn&#39;t neutral) and the Axis powers flew over them. That sounds more like what I&#39;ve heard, but different from what you originally said. If Switzerland had been actually purposefully attacked, there would be substantial evidence, but there really isn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were multiple aerial fights between the Luftwaffe and the Swiss Air Force between May and June 1940. Which involved Luftwaffe picking the fight and being pushed back by a combination of Swiss airplanes and anti-aircraft that had originally been intended for export to Germany. Eleven German planes were lost in all.</p>

<p>The Allied attacks were largely accidental bombings, but civilians still died. Also, one Swiss pilot was shot down by an bomber escort. It could have escalated, but the Swiss backed off confronting airspace violations. </p>

<p>The Nazis were needling Swiss air defenses until they stopped because of the bad PR of losing planes to a neutral nation. Switzerland wasn&#39;t a major combat zone at all, but to act like the Swiss were completely neutral and removed from both world wars like the submitter said is a little silly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Switzerland was in the middle of a continent-wide battlefield, surrounded by belligerent powers. It would have been impossible to be removed form both world wars. Defending their territory does not make them not neutral, in fact, just the opposite as far as I am concerned. There were a handful of skirmishes, and stupid mistakes certainly, no doubt, but to consider Switzerland a combat zone, of any sort, is also a little silly. The Helvetic Confederation <em>was</em> neutral and profited greatly from said neutrality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well.. the problem is that &#39;neutral&#39; implies a lack of involvement.  I believe that not only, as you say, they profited greatly, but that these profits derived from their involvement in the war and possible orchestration of both sides through monetary and other manipulations.</p>

<p>The Grimm-<strong>Hoffmann</strong> affair looks interesting.  I don&#39;t see how that makes Switzerland look any less suspicious though, quite the opposite.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Whats the source for that?  I find it hard to believe that a country smaller than West Virginia could hold off global military forces totaling more than 100 million personnel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assume your grandma is Swiss German right? I&#39;ve never heard that, although I guess I am not surprised. I knew there was a small Swiss Nazi party, so while most Swiss where attached to their traditions, they were still pragmatists and if it came worst to worst, some would have &quot;welcomed&quot; the union with the Third Reich very well prepared. I live in Swiss Romande and I don&#39;t think people really would have enjoyed that very much, maybe joined the Vichy government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Switzerland has a strong democracy and always profited from being neutral. That is why so many International Organisations have their seat there. The reason that there are so many banks and large corporations in switzerland is that they have low taxes and actual bank secrecy, that only recently has been compromised to some extend. They are also very reluctant to allow any immigration and to grant citizenship to anybody, so that they have little or no problem with uneducated immigrants. In short they did nearly everything right in the last century.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can only assume that you are not from Europe, because you have a very skewed image of Switzerland. They have public votes on every major issue and are pretty liberal on some issues (legal (medical) marihuana, passive (to some extend active) euthanasia), while remaining conservative in other areas. There is a not so large gap between rich and poor due to the high average income. And what exactly is wrong with not letting people immigrate that don&#39;t offer any skills that your country needs? I think that is more than sensible, especially if you are a small country with no borders to underdeveloped countries.
Also please read the wikipedia article. You will find that Switzerland had been pretty poor before the 20th century in general. But even before that they had some admirable political ideas and structure, which was better than in most of Europe at that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland_as_a_federal_state">time</a>.  They just did the right thing, while everyone else fucked up in Europe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not intend to offend or condemn all Swiss citizens of the present or past.  However, if playing host to Lucifer is the right thing for Switzerland, it does not help the rest of humanity.  (Just to clarify, I am not the least bit religious or slanted towards Christianity or any other religion.)</p>

<p>I keep mentioning Lucifer because I believe that quite literally the recent incarnations of these ancient occult religious traditions related to sun worship, etc., are providing the philosophic basis and rationalization for the self-interested, parasitic monetary control structures dominating the globe today, as they have for millennia.</p>

<p>This is from the Luciferian Manifest at ordo-luciferi.org and it sounds like the type of thought pattern that is propagating to support the types of activities currently centered in Switzerland among other areas:</p>

<p>&quot;Luciferians are in the world but not of it. They are Self-Aware conscious beings that can exist beyond the clan-mind and its cultural and social restraints. For such restraints repress the individual and inhibit self-development. Cultural systems that are built upon false security and false superiority harbor the weak, such systems are threatened by individualization and therefore shun it. It is the conditioning by such systems that prevents people from finding individual light, for it instills the fear of being alone in the world. A Luciferian realizes their own isolation and is able walk alone, but is never lonely.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A Luciferian does what all others say cannot be done. To walk the fence, balanced between opposing forces; to experience both the positive and negative attributes of life, and thereby experience life to its fullest potential.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Luciferian is just to those who are just, respectful to those who are respectful, and makes others strong in time of weakness, while not tolerating the weak. Freedom does not belong to the weak, they feed off the strong who fight for it, therefore they must be eliminated. Weakness is limitation and that which holds back evolutionary advancement. One must overcome the lower self, that which is weak, and become the Higher Self, which is the strength of ones own inner truth.&quot;</p>

<p>This type of philosophy could easily be used to rationalize war profiteering and even war engineering, as well as eugenics and economic warfare.  I am not accusing the Swiss people (generally) of engaging in these activities but they appear to be hosting institutions that are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I could be cynic and say that is just how capitalism works and there is no need for any (secret) cult to be involved with it, although that would be much more exciting and interesting, but I don&#39;t think you would agree with me anyway. From my point of view corporations have no soul (maybe family owned ones, but that depends on the family) and no morale per se. They do however usually obey to laws. Due to globalization this is however no longer a real restriction, since there are enough failed countries and loopholes to avoid pretty much any law. Therefore every country that has a certain level of developement is threatened: Either they adapt their society to fit the needs of large corporations or they will lose power, influence and wealth. At least that is what nearly every politician used to tell you. The challenge to every society is to withstand this pressure and develop into one whose prosperity is not so much fueled by wild capitalism but sustainability, culture and science.</p>

<p>Edit: That last sentence is a bit airy. What I am meaning to say is, that small self-sustained/independent communities/countries with direct democracy and a high level of education and research are most likely to succeed under those circumstances. Switzerland is far from perfect, but it fits this description pretty good (Ok I tailored it a bit towards it). One thing that misses for example is a stronger focus on green ecological industries. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We do know that these Luciferian types of religions exist and their philosophies do appear to support unfettered self-interest, corruption and killing.  When you get to high levels of global financial secrecy and manipulating people into mass killing that leads me to suspect something deeper than ordinary corporate greed is involved.  As a side note, the environmentalism is probably derived from ancient nature worship which may have been incorporated into some of these sun-worshiping religions.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need these religious ideas in themselves but they appear to form the foundation of the theories rationalizing the extreme behaviors that have been identified as being highly destructive towards the human organism.</p>

<p>As far as adapting to survive, the reality is most places have had to adapt, so one might be accused (incorrectly in my case, as I really do see things this way) of a certain amount of hypocrisy involved in pointing at that country in particular (although it is quite a significant center of this system).  Actually I should admit that I live in a navy town full of military bases with nuclear warships and fighter jets, where the Navy Seal barracks is shaped in the form of a swastika (ancient sun-worship symbol).</p>

<p>Anyway good for Switzerland on the direct democracy and the excellent adaption to the &quot;illuminated&quot; philosophies.</p>
