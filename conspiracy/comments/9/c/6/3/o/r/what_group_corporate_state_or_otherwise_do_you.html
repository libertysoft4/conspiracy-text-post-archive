<p>Have you ever given Joseph P. Farrell an honest listen? He has hours and hours of audio files on The Byte Show&#39;s website...as well as all of his 20+ books. He truly is the best in the &#39;alternative research&#39; field.   </p>

<p>Please take the time to explain to me why you think Joseph Farrell is one of Their tools. I am all ears. Because he is my favorite and inspires me the most, so I need to be open to other people being critical of him. Please, explain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I haven&#39;t - that&#39;s why I said I don&#39;t necessarily think he is a gatekeeper. I just gave obvious reasons as to why a skeptic would at first question the claims. I didn&#39;t make too many assumptions really. We have seen it time and time again, a journalist gets too close to the real story and gets killed. What makes this man so special that he can say everything TPTB don&#39;t want us to know, yet remain alive? Again, I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s a shill, but that question needs answering.</p>

<p>Yes, him selling books is a problem. It makes it seem less about disclosure and more about a paycheck. He could&#39;ve blogged this his entire life. I agree, it doesn&#39;t inherently make him a shill, but it doesn&#39;t help for accusations. Look at Greer, Cameron, icke, or any other person. One of their biggest complaints is that they SELL this info to us.</p>

<p>You got very defensive at me when I was only trying to show you why someone would maybe find the man sketchy. </p>
