<p>The US people actually do care about foreigners, it&#39;s why the military industrial complex needs to pull off false flags in order to get the people behind it.  Also, throughout the 90&#39;s the free Tibet movement was huge, and they <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Freedom_Concert">even had a festival</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, my point of view is the American people care about foreigners, but it&#39;s based on the propaganda they&#39;re fed.  Americans will pour money and fight for people if the media sells it right.  Our population has been trained to feed off of media, and will eat up what they are provided.  Hence why I question, what&#39;s going on, when I see the MSM plastering some dead or bloody baby all over the news... Normally to push some regime change.  So! Although I agree most people couldn&#39;t care less about illegal immigrants from Mexico or other Latin countries, but they aren&#39;t fed how the US policies undermine those countries economically or politically, yet help drug cartels.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For anyone that looks into it, the people of Tibet are a thousand times better off since the Chinese government pushed aside the primitive and absolute rule of the Dalai-Lama and the Lamaseries and commenced to modernize what was &quot;The Autonomous Province if Tibet&quot; under their autonomy. </p>

<p>Tibet has always been a part of China and the very first Emperor of China actually came from Tibet. The resistance to the Chinese authorities applying the same rules and standards in Tibet and attempting to standardize them with the ones that exist in all of China was in Nepal, backed and financed by the US, and led by the Dalai-Lama&#39;s own brother. </p>

<p>No mention is ever made about the fact that there was no freedom of movement or choice of work, or personal choice even in things like marriages under that monastic system and no any regard for anyone&#39;s personal plight or hardships since that was decreed as being their &quot;karma&quot;. They now have thousands of miles of modern paved roads, land distribution, schools, libraries and hospitals. None of which previously existed, and NO they don&#39;t want the Dalai-Lama back or any form of a return to that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Under Chinese rule many modern day Tibetans cannot practice their religion openly and must do in secret. Modern infrastructure is great but you don&#39;t need to invade and takeover a country to promote those things. It&#39;s also false to state that modern Tibetans do not value the Dalai Lama, you can find plentiful evidence of Tibetans celebrating Buddhism and visiting lamas. I also don&#39;t understand what you mean by redistributing land, is monastery land special in some places? Tibet is massive, I don&#39;t see how monasteries could take up that much land, even with how numerous they were and are.</p>

<p>Modernizing a nation doesn&#39;t justify use of force, it doesn&#39;t justify cultural erasure or the forced acceptance of tons of Han Chinese either. For all that China has accomplished it has many flaws. Big brother is massive in China to the extent of a social credit system, the great firewall, and a great deal of censorship too. I&#39;ve spoken with people who have been to Tibet, there are government informants everywhere. China deserves all of the criticism it gets. Trying to explain things with a historical and analytical lense is fine, trying to write off the horrible things Communist China did and modern day China does as Western spin is dishonest to an extreme degree.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also funny you justify what China did with the value of modernization, not too long before the invasion of Tibet the Chinese were just as behind. You likely fail to realize that Buddhism was an adaptive tool that was used to reduce warring and feudalism in the country(although warlords still did exist, many of them deferred to the monastic leaders). You highlight the barbarity of Gelug rule without considering the potential systems of rule that would have happened without the influence of religion. </p>

<p>Now China is a nation of one and a half billion people who speak over 500 different dialects and have lived under one dynasty or another for more than 3,500 years with a great deal of chaos, death, and destruction between the fall of one and the rise of the next until the western colonial powers came along in the 1800&#39;s to take control without giving much of anything back until the Revolution that was as much about getting rid of their imperialist overlords as anything else and attempting to bring the country into the modern age and modern times as quickly as possible. </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m no fonder of Communism as it was practiced in Russia or China but I will admit that there isn&#39;t another system that could have pulled either country together or moved it into the modern era in as short a timeframe as it did given just how very far behind they both were to begin with. We&#39;re basically talking feudalism and quasi feudalism under what was already a communal manner of living, and it went out of vogue in the west in the 15th century but not in theirs. Communism was less of a stretch because they already lived in communal situations under their monarchs, emperors, and their relatives.</p>

<p>So we had countless millions of mainly illiterate people who were living the way that those of us in the west had left behind virtually 500 years before them and with the benefit of a far more gradual and steady improvement in our own lives during which our democracies and acknowledgement of our basic human rights finally took shape. </p>

<p>History didn&#39;t give them that opportunity and we have no right to judge what they ultimately did given that our own governments were definitely not on the side of those ordinary people or in freeing them from the poverty and ignorance they were compelled to live in, in either case. The fact of the matter is that even now they don&#39;t want them to succeed or for their people to have any better lives or better prospects for the future, they want their countries to collapse and fall into a third world status so that they can be more easily controlled, dominated and exploited by the so-called west for their own gain.</p>

<p>Right, that&#39;s feudalism. You&#39;re completely ignoring that without Tibetan Buddhism there still would have been feudalism, but it would have feudalism under warlords. In fact, you have failed to address many of my points, you have straight up ignored the points that are most detrimental to your own argument. </p>

<p>And how many people in modern day China truly have personal autonomy? You&#39;re largely held back by your wealth, and while there is opportunity for upwards mobility, that&#39;s tied to a persons ability to access education, which is tied to how much wealth they have access to in most cases. Additionally modern Chinese do not have political autonomy, it&#39;s the CCP and no other party. There are factions within the CCP, but you&#39;re not getting any other options and dissent is heavily punished to the point of death. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now there were no paved roads, no schools, no libraries or hospitals and the vast majority of Tibetans were both poor and illiterate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It basically seems to me that you&#39;re using infrastructure as a justification for the negative actions of the CCP. That&#39;s a valid argument, sure, but the value of it is based on your own valuation of modern infrastructure. At least in what you&#39;ve said in this thread you&#39;re not acknowledging the negative aspects of modernity, such as increased amounts of mental illness in the population or increased amounts of suicide. The latter aspect is something China has a problem with to the point that suicide nets are installed outside of factories to prevent workers from killing themselves. </p>

<p>You&#39;re making an argument about the Gelug being oppressive without acknowledging the oppression that the CCP inflicts on the Tibetan people. It&#39;s highly ironic. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>what it managed to do for them and they would still be living that way now and hundred years from now if the Chinese government hadn&#39;t interceded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s no way to tell that, that&#39;s your own assumption. Many nations have made industrial leaps in the last century. Tibet is in a key location geopolitically and has access to many resources. I&#39;d argue there was no way that Tibet wouldn&#39;t modernize at some point, it simply has too many mineral resources. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>China would not have been able to modernize without the help of such &#39;imperial overlords&#39;. China didn&#39;t have much in terms of infrastructure until the 80&#39;s when it became a place to manufacture goods for the rest of the world. Even today China would fall apart quickly without access to western markets. When you consider the % of exports that go the the EU, US, and even Asian countries such as SK and Japan(who&#39;s modernization was made possible due to relations with western powers) you can easily see how this is the case. </p>

<p>The main thing is subjective. Personally I wouldn&#39;t want to live in a totalitarian state with horrendous pollution just so I could have access to modern infrastructure. I&#39;m not sure what you mean by ignoring, many people have spoken well of China&#39;s accomplishments and how the west is failing in comparison to it&#39;s most recent gains. That doesn&#39;t mean you should discard discussion of all the problems there are and have been.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Maybe that&#39;s true, I would disagree and say other systems could have worked as well. I&#39;ll also ask would it have been so bad if Russia and China had to modernize slowly if that meant that 10&#39;s of millions of people would not have starved to death, and countless millions of others would not have had to live under totalitarian states? You simply cannot overlook the negative actions committed by communism. Countless millions were starved or put in camps, countless others lived and had to suffer under corrupt and absurd regimes. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So we had countless millions of mainly illiterate people who were living the way that those of us in the west had left behind virtually 500 years before them and with the benefit of a far more gradual and steady improvement in our own lives during which we became literate and our democracies and acknowledgement of our basic human rights finally took shape.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And what would have been wrong with a steady improvement for China or Russia? You have modern infrastructure in these countries just like we have in the west, but you don&#39;t have democracy and it&#39;s easy to see how human rights have less respect and value in those countries too. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>History didn&#39;t give them that opportunity and we have no right to judge</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh we certainly do have the right to judge. You&#39;re not the arbiter of such matters. I live in a (relatively) free country, if I want to criticize the CCP or China for the wrongs it has committed I can do that, just as you&#39;re free to criticize the Gelug or other groups and countries. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact of the matter is that even now they don&#39;t want them to succeed or for their people to have any better lives or better prospects for the future, they want their countries to collapse and fall into a third world status so that they can be more easily controlled, dominated and exploited by the so-called west for their own gain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you think China and Russia don&#39;t want that for the west? You seriously need to look into the subversion that those countries engage in. In fact you can easily find evidence that any modern nation that is interested in geopolitical influence wants that for other countries. Governments seek the destruction of their adversaries through the least resource intensive measures possible, and they want obedient vassals for countries that are not their rivals. That&#39;s largely what the occupation of Tibet was about. It wasn&#39;t about some romantic bullshit of communists wanting to free the common people from their religious overlords, it was about occupying a country that had been hostile towards them in the past, occupying the Tibetan plateau to prevent influence from foreign powers and reduce the threat of invasion, and to get access to resources. China is about as interested in freeing the common people as the United States is in bring democracy and freedom to people in the middle east. It&#39;s a nice bit of propaganda meant to cover up for serious geopolitical interests. </p>

<p>The Lamas were &quot;the Feudal Landlords&quot; of Tibet and the people were their serfs, permanently tied to that land and the districts they were born into for life, and brutally punished and tortured if they ever dared to disobey. </p>

<p>Whatever the people produced was the property of the lamaseries who took and doled it out as they saw fit which was just enough for them to barely survive while the monks lived comfortably within their castle-like monasteries and paid tribute to the main lamasery and the Dalai-Lama just like any Medieval aristocrats with their liege lords and kings did, which is basically what they were in everything but name. </p>

<p>Tibetan Buddhism is unlike the Han form of it that had just as long of a history as well but was a-political while the Tibetan form with it&#39;s emphasis on karma and reincarnation conveniently became the actual means to govern and hold the people in bondage, not free or liberate them from it. </p>

<p>At the passing of any Dalai-Lama the head monks choose the next one as ostensibly being his next reincarnation that they then groomed from childhood to take his place and ensure that everything remained and stayed exactly the same. </p>

<p>We&#39;re not talking about this occurring in some distant ancient past of warlords but right up until 1949 while the far more civilized and mercantile dynastic rule over the rest of the country had been systematically sabotaged, subverted, and impoverished by the opium, exploitation, and military force used by the British, French and Americans for over 100 years until it finally fell into ruins along with most of the country which was subsequently declared a Republic 1912.</p>

<p>Very much a western backed and controlled republic which miserably failed to progress or prevail in any way against the very real and massive problems of poverty, hunger, and death at an early age that finally led to the Communist uprising and take-over with the promise of pulling out all the stops to try and put an end to it and the gross inequality and the ongoing foreign interference and exploitation that they viewed with some justification as being the cause of it.</p>

<p>As for you being the smug and judgemental creature that you are, it&#39;s very clear that you don&#39;t give a tinker&#39;s damn about the plight that faced the masses of Chinese people or their struggle to secure their most basic physical needs. </p>

<p>They have had plenty of freedom to be poor, sick, exploited and miserable which is the only kind you seem to think that that they need. They willingly traded that to be free from privation and materially improve their lot in life  and that is their government&#39;s main goal. </p>

<p>They and Russia are the only two nations with a rapidly expanding middle class which is essential for political stability and why both actually are politically stable while the opposite is now true throughout the west with political instability growing just as fast as the middleclass is being whittled down and impoverished by governments that no longer serve them.</p>

<p>Do you? Again you have failed to address any of my points. Do you know how arguing works? You literally think you can ignore the points someone else makes. You&#39;re a clown who thinks arguing is plugging his ears and spouting off a monologue. You are so arrogant and foolish it astounds me.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>As I said before, yes that&#39;s feudalism. The Tibetan bureuacrats did do terrible things, and so does China today. I&#39;m not arguing the mistreatment of Tibetans by their rulers, that&#39;s agreed upon. What is up for debate is the idea that the Chinese treat the Tibetans poorly too. You&#39;re trying to write off all of the wrongdoings of the Chinese government because of infrastructure and education. You also fail to realize it&#39;s not the Tibetan people that are the primary beneficiaries of these changes because China is constantly moving Han Chinese to the area, slowly erasing the Tibetan people and their culture. The Tibetan people do not have autonomy in any of this. What happens in their country is ultimately up to the CCP and it&#39;s interests, something I have mentioned before and you failed to acknowledge in any capacity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tibetan form with it&#39;s emphasis on karma and reincarnation </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The concepts of karma and reincarnation are inherent to Buddhist belief. If Han &#39;Buddhism&#39; doesn&#39;t contain those concepts, it&#39;s not Buddhism. This can be easily understood if you understand who Siddharta Guatama was and what he did according to Buddhism. It doesn&#39;t surprise me that Chinese &#39;buddhism&#39; would have done away with these concepts, China is deathly afraid of any real religion gaining influence because the CCP has a loose hold on the country despite all of it&#39;s totalitarian powers. It&#39;s funny to me you would emphasize karma so much when the CCP uses social credit systems to gauge a citizen&#39;s trustworthiness. This system can make or break a person&#39;s ability to succeed in the country, and isn&#39;t just tied to a single person&#39;s actions, your social credit score can go down based on whom you associate with, such as your parents. How is that for karma.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Looks like you&#39;re ignorant of history. Warlords existed in that part of the world up until the 40&#39;s. China saw a period of warlords as late as 1928 with some warlords exerting influence until the 40&#39;s. Shows how little you know about the country you love dickriding. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As for you being the smug and judgemental creature that you are</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why? Because I&#39;m making points that you clearly can&#39;t argue against? It&#39;s not judgmental to point out governments doing bad things. Smug would be insulting the intelligence of the person you&#39;re debating with by question whether or not something is wrong with their brain. Once again, you&#39;re a clown who can&#39;t argue for shit so you have to resort to ignoring points and denigrating. I try not to do that myself, but you have made it apparent you&#39;re a Chinese dickriding clown.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They have had plenty of freedom to be poor, sick, exploited and miserable</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What you mean like modern Chinese? lol. What do you think someone is when they work long hours for low pay, in dystopian hell hole cities where there is rampant corruption and terrible pollution? All to make products that will be exported to other countries. The average chinese citizen is the very definition of poor, sick, exploited and miserable. Most Chinese are not middle or upper class, they are poor. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They willingly traded that to be free from privation and materially improve their lot in life and that is their government&#39;s main goal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you really believe that shit? Do you think life is a Disney movie or something? The CCP want power and money, like all corrupt bureaucrats. You can&#39;t wish better lives for your citizens and subject them to a totalitarian state that seeks out and eliminates dissidents. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russia are the only two nations with a rapidly expanding middle class</p>
</blockquote>

<p>China has an expanding middle class because it can export so much. Without the rest of the world to buy its products, China is NOTHING. It would collapse in chaos in short time. China also steals intellectual property and technology from other countries. Russia doesn&#39;t have an expanding middle class. Russia has oil, ports that are frozen part of the year, and sanctions. There&#39;s simply not enough economic activity in Russia to support a middle class and the profits of oligarchs. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>by governments that no longer serve them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh yes and the Chinese government will serve its citizens... until they want to protest(cough Tiananmen square cough). Or practice an alternative religion(I guess you&#39;re not aware of how the Chinese government imprisons and even harvests the organs of religious and ethnic minorities). </p>

<p>It&#39;s such a joke that you want to heap praises on China and can&#39;t acknowledge even the most minute details of it&#39;s wrongdoings. Shows how weak and rigid your views are. Why don&#39;t you move to China? Well, good luck getting citizenship as a non Han person. If you are Han, that would explain your dickriding and blindness to the clear and well documented case of all of the shit the CCP has done. Since you don&#39;t come off as a western tankie, maybe you are a Chinese person who lives in the west. Otherwise, I don&#39;t see how you would be so blinded by the modernization of China that you completely fail to acknowledge any of evidence of wrongdoing. </p>
