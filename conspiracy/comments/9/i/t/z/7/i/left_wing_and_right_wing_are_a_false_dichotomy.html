        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The conception of the far right and far left in modern America have one thing in common, totalitarianism. The idea that liberalism and conservatism are far ends of a political spectrum is illogical. Why would a spectrum have totalitarianism at both ends? Is there not a better conceptualization of these concepts?</p>

<p>In truth, we must look to the root of the words conservative and liberal. What is being conserved? If we go back to the beginning of time, when man still occupied the wilds, we lived in a state of anarchy. We thus conserve a decentralized &quot;state&quot; or better yet an &quot;unstate&quot; in absolute conservatism. Then what would the the tenants of liberalism? Change? And centralization to enforce that change? Following this to its logical conclusion it is interesting to see how the effect of liberation in full force comes all the way to neo Caesarism. Liberation by force. If we simply say that left corresponds to change and the right corresponds to stasis we can establish a base line definition that can be plugged into a binary of active and passive. A binary, rather than a dichotomy. A system that is in a healthy balance with itself rather than two distinct systems. Thus, the right and left are a tug of war of stasis and change within a closed system. They are not competing systems.</p>

<p>This approach of looking at left and right can be used to help conceptualize a symbiotic system where the left and right work together in critique to form both a society of order and of freedom. There is a healthy medium between absolute freedom and absolute totalitarianism. We must find it. </p>

<p>Left wing and right wing must work in unison for the bird to achieve flight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been liking the idea of viewing the political spectrum as a circle, with totalitarianism at the top, anarchism (voluntarism) at the bottom, and left and right on their respective sides. </p>

<p>The reason I find this illustrative is that at the top of the circle, at authoritarianism, it doesn&#39;t really matter whether your politics are left or right, because <em>your</em> politics don&#39;t matter, only that of the ruling class does. Put another way, as a state becomes more totalitarian, the difference between left and right diminish. </p>

<p>Similarly, as you move downward towards anarchism, again the differences tend to diminish, at least in terms of state power. An anarcho-communist has a rather different philosophy than an anarcho-capitalist, but from the point of view of state power, it doesn&#39;t matter. Both (if they&#39;re sincere in their beliefs), want the end of all coercive state power and the flourishing of voluntary human freedom. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I hear you, we should come up with creative terms like that. I know terms take on different meanings in different areas.

<p>The sold-out labor movements that are interested in their own advancement rather than a broad progressive agenda are, I don&#39;t know, the phony establishment liberal left.

<p>And I guess that&#39;s the problem. They need to be centered between the center and the far left. </p>

<p>While progressive (as we are both understanding it to mean) is one of the more palatable political ideologies, it also needs a good set of brakes. Without self awareness, an out of control progressive can easily swing hard left.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t say &quot;the left&quot; &quot;the progressives&quot; or any of that extremely generalizing nonsense as that&#39;s only legitimizing their psyop. There&#39;s no such thing as the hive mind entity called &quot;thee left&quot;. Corporate media pushes that bullshit. The spectrum is big and left wingers don&#39;t always share the same beliefs and even some who claim to be left wing are not even left wing (e.g. many democrat politicians are wallstreet corporatist extremists e.g. Clinton/Obama like basically all Repubs, just slightly different shade of the same trickle down bullshit ideology that fucked the middle class and working class to benefit oligarchs/corps/banksters).</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/fUH4nZp.png">https://i.imgur.com/fUH4nZp.png</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m center left wing myself (centrist is also fine with me) and I recommend these terms to describe the following beliefs:</p>

<p><strong>SJW</strong>: (I don&#39;t think this is synonymous with &quot;far left wingers&quot; as they&#39;re not all SJWs)</p>

<p>Pushing gender fluidity/58 genders and trans stuff on young children, feminism (esp. third wave), muh &quot;white privilege&quot; divide and conquer, pro-mass immigration no matter what, &quot;muh cis white male patriarchy!&quot;, &quot;it&#39;s only racis if you have power&quot; bullshit logic.</p>

<p>You can see these shills on compromised r/socialism, r/latestagecapitalism, r/fullcommunism, r/completeanarchy (allegedly &quot;left wing&quot; subs yet are soaked in SJW shills, tankies, etc. who censor and ridicule anything against the establishment narrative)
There&#39;s also the anti-capitalist rhetoric in some of them which is deliberately to slow the revolution down. Capitalism is flawed but populist socialistic capitalism blends (FDR/Bernie/)</p>

<p><strong>Legit left wing</strong>:</p>

<p>Pro-human rights (incl. LGBT but not the twisted shit like &quot;forced equality&quot; and pushing it on children), anti-mass immigration (not blaming non-criminal immigrants but fighting the root causes of mass immigration: banksters&#39; wars and transnational corporate jobs outsourcing globalist economics), maybe humanist but not feminist, pro-worker rights, anti-war, pro-free speech, anti-authoritarian at least for the most part.</p>

<p>But you will have shills pushing partisan bullshit or identity politics branding. I don&#39;t have near zero faith in Repubs and Trump, and little faith in the Democrat party after what happened to Bernie but some think it&#39;s going to get cleaned up from the inside. We will have to see. Corporate donors, superPACs, etc. = automatic shill probably. That&#39;s my litmus test.... for now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure, but I still don&#39;t know what you&#39;re getting at substantively. It&#39;s all good. I was just explaining what the terms left and right mean when they&#39;re used in a political context. I&#39;m well-aware that in so many places, including here in the states, the liberal-leaning party has been corrupted by corporate influences and identity politics has been forced into the dialogue by big foundations, blurring the situation a lot. But it&#39;s not like the terms don&#39;t have meaning. </p>

<p>My own politics are decidedly left-wing. I believe in universal health care and a high minimum wage. That said, I&#39;m a drug legalization activist and unifier overall, and I&#39;ve worked with a lot of libertarians who disagree with me on social services but agree on personal freedom. That&#39;s ok, I don&#39;t hate my right-leaning friends; we just have our disagreements. The only people I don&#39;t even waste time talking to are fundamentalist religious fanatics, homophobes, racists, those sorts of people. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Hit the jackpot. The corporatists try to shift the spectrum artificially and the SJW ideology is the identity politics that are used to discredit real pro-worker leftism. There&#39;s nothing left wing about third wave feminism, blaming &quot;white cis male patriarchy&quot; for what the banksters, corporations, wallstreet, M.I.C., secret societies, etc. are doing. </p>

<p>The gov is supposed to protect us from corps, criminals and warlords. Remove the conflicts of interest (bribery/blackmail/corporate money in politics) and we have a chance of getting our gov back. Like a cop is supposed to be on our side.</p>

<p>I try to encourage anti-extremism and unification of (non-authoritarian forms of) very moderate right, centrist and center left economics.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/fUH4nZp.png">https://i.imgur.com/fUH4nZp.png</a></p>

<p>But some people are ideological zealots with partisan programming. Bullshit like &quot;we need a free market which means no regulations!&quot; which is a bullshit shill definition. Free market just means &quot;perfectly competitive market&quot; which is a theoretical thing like anarcho-communism (I think it won&#39;t be possible for hundreds of years, unlimited resources and tech which may be suppressed).</p>

<p>The closest to a perfect market (ethical and efficient and fair) is a FAIR market. This means checks and balances. Democratic regulations (the good ones not the cronyist obstructions and corporatist ghost contracts). Workers must be protected or we&#39;re fucked.</p>

<p>America is marketed extremism. The libertarian party is extreme right libertarian which is a trojan horse. Very moderate right, centrist and left liberarianism exist and are waaaaay more anti-establishment. But that goes against their narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no &quot;THE left&quot; entity. We are not hive minded partisan robots. And even the Dem party hasn&#39;t been left wing for decades.
There are fixed labels. Both parties have been NEOliberals (corporatists and cronyists) since Reagan and NEOconservatives (authoritarian warmongers) for even longer. Obama/Clinton/Bush/Romney/Cruz/etc. are all NEOlibs and NEOcons simultaneously. </p>

<p>90% of media owned by 6 corps - corporate media pushes a false spectrum. This is why they shat on Bernie (European centrist/American slightly left aka social democracy mixed economics socialistic capitalism).</p>

<p>SJW culture is not left wing but a modern psyop ideology pushed by the establishment.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not denying reality. Not everyone is a hive minded. You will get tired of confused normies figuring things out but you will find smart people who know the truth too. We shouldn&#39;t call arbitrary vague groups &quot;THE left&quot; especially when not all of them are left wing and not all left wingers think the same anyway. It&#39;s peer pressure and propaganda from the SJW psyop. Many people saw through the &quot;vote Clinton because we need a woman president&quot; bullshit because it was EASY to break the argument even for many normies. &quot;Uh Clinton is corrupt, I don&#39;t care about the fucking gender, vote Jill Stein if you&#39;re so obsessed with a female pres&quot;.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is it&#39;s dangerous to try to shift the spectrum and claim &quot;this pocket of SJW brainwashed morons and normies must be what leftism is&quot; is just wrong. It&#39;s like &quot;Wow American normies don&#39;t care about NSA spying, I guess this is what freedom is in the land of the free&quot;. It puts strawman arguments to use for shills.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m an actual left winger who cares about fellow workers and small/medium ethically run businesses. And yet shills will shit on leftism just by yelling &quot;FEMINIST WHITE GENOCIDE ANTI-FREE SPEECH PROPAGANDA LEFTISM!!!!&quot;. It&#39;s fucked. If it&#39;s not leftist, don&#39;t call it leftism man. Intellectual dishonesty is what it is. SJWism is a shitty modern psyop invention. Even politicians who people can tell are very right wing economically, push SJWism as well! (Angela Merkel, Hillary Clinton, Theresa May) lol </p>

That night follows day, there are many dualities. But to sum up politics in a binary way seems arbitrary to me. The lumbering giant of the state does put left and right in front but the direction remains the same. Trying to assign virtues and failings to either side. Just by acknowledging there maybe a common ground. A fulcrum if you will adds a 3rd view. Being a moderate is a tricky position it seems. I&#39;d rather be in the middle than lopsided.

    <div class="md"><p>Complete bullshit premise just by the fact corporatist wallstreet warmongers Clinton/Obama are more similar to Reagan/Romney/Cruz/Rubio/Bush etc. All shitty extreme right economics and very authoritarian. There hasn&#39;t been a left wing force in power for decades. You also sound intellectually dishonest when you claim to want union between left/right yet only very recently were you dividing people by claiming &quot;the tolerant left is censoring&quot;. Wrong. Corporations as part of the extreme right economic establishment are. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/fUH4nZp.png">https://i.imgur.com/fUH4nZp.png</a></p>

<p>FDR/Eisenhower/Teddy Roosevelt/JFK &gt; Reagan/Bush/Obama/Clinton.</p>

<p>SJWs vs muh far right is horseshit pushed by the establishment (remember Antifa VS Neonazi psyop). The extreme right economic corporate establishment promoted SJWism (I wouldn&#39;t call this very modern psyop ideology &quot;far left&quot; as even some far left people may be anti-SJW depending on their beliefs). </p>

<p>And being anti-mass immigration is not socially &quot;far right&quot; nazi shit like the corporatist (economically far right) media claim. They&#39;re pushing identity politics and extremism. I am center left economically, socially non-authoritarian (left libertarian) and want to attack the root causes of mass immigration, not shit on non-criminal immigrants. Divide and conquer is the establishment&#39;s tool. Don&#39;t bother with bullshit like trans bathrooms and borders......go straight for the fucking money trail. </p>

<p>Corporate money in politics is the first obstacle. Then we have to deal with the private cronyist FED, elite central banksters, M.I.C. and secret societies. But step 1 will weaken the establishment dramatically buying us time to break up big corporations and reform elections and currency.</p>

<p>This is approximately the NWO conspiracy:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The left corresponds to change. Morpheus means change. Neo was looking for change in the Matrix, but when everything was said and done, The Matrix did not change.</p>

<p>When the word change is uttered by TPTB, what they really mean is &quot;more money for me&quot;. There is no bird. You&#39;re right about the dichotomy, but it&#39;s a false one. The wings don&#39;t actually exist - not even as metaphors. The truth of the matter is generally rich vs. poor and they will never come together. We use words like right and left as labels for some kind of broad heuristic description because they&#39;re used by the mass media, not because they&#39;re useful</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since nobody seems to be able to define the conceptual words, why use them? There are perfectly good words we can use that are not so confusing: Democrats and Republicans.</p>

<p>Since these terms represent the big parties they mean what they say they mean, by definition, they are platforms, not concepts.</p>

<p>For example, Democrats are against corporate personhood, Republicans are for corporate personhood. Republicans are against net neutrality, Democrats are for net neutrality. Democrats are for expanding citizen health coverage, Republicans are for eliminating health coverage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure, but I still don&#39;t know what you&#39;re getting at substantively. It&#39;s all good. I was just explaining what the terms left and right mean when they&#39;re used in a political context. I&#39;m well-aware that in so many places, including here in the states, the liberal-leaning party has been corrupted by corporate influences and identity politics has been forced into the dialogue by big foundations, blurring the situation a lot. But it&#39;s not like the terms don&#39;t have meaning. </p>

<p>My own politics are decidedly left-wing. I believe in universal health care and a high minimum wage. That said, I&#39;m a drug legalization activist and unifier overall, and I&#39;ve worked with a lot of libertarians who disagree with me on social services but agree on personal freedom. That&#39;s ok, I don&#39;t hate my right-leaning friends; we just have our disagreements. The only people I don&#39;t even waste time talking to are fundamentalist religious fanatics, homophobes, racists, those sorts of people. </p>
