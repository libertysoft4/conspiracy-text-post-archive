        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>40 years of increasing oligarchy have gotten us to this level of debt slavery. </p>

<ul>
<li>1. (Age 5-18): Spend 12 years in public school becoming indoctrinated in the &quot;benefits&quot; of the police state and ubiquitous surveillance. </li>
<li>2. (Age 18-22) Spend 4 years and $50k-100k earning the necessary college degree required to make a decent salary. </li>
<li>3. (Age 22-30): Enter the workforce and spend the next 5-10 years paying off your student loans. During this time you will also be required to pay your rent and possibly a car loan. Saving is not option here.</li>
<li>4. (Age 30-50): Pay off student loans. Buy a house and incur $100k-250k debt to be paid off over the next 20-30 years. During this period, you&#39;ll also be expected to give any excess income to Wall Street under the guise of retirement preparation. Hopefully, you didn&#39;t make a career choice in an industry that allows wage suppression via outsourcing, AI, or H1B visa abuse. </li>
<li>5. (Age 50-65): Assuming that you didn&#39;t have to take too many HELOCs, pay off your home loan. Now that you don&#39;t have any mortgage debt, you are expected to put this money and all additional excess income into Wall Street via your retirement savings. Hopefully, you will stay in good health, since any major illness can bankrupt you with medical expenses. BTW, at this point, the medical industry is owned by Wall Street, too. </li>
<li>6. (Age 65-80): You made it. After spending a lifetime of paying Wall Street in one form or another, you may have saved enough to retire. Hopefully, Wall Street didn&#39;t lose your savings in yet another bubble collapse. Of course, you dont want to start spending extravagantly because high medical expenses are inevitable at this stage of your life. If you are fortunate, you&#39;ll die quickly preventing the medical industry from taking your remaining assets and just, maybe, you&#39;ll have something to pass on to your heirs. </li>
</ul>

<p>tldr; You spend your entire life paying the oligarchy for the privilege of living only to have them repossess it at the end. It is a great time to be a billionaire. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let’s not forget that the entire duration you’ll be paying ~30% of your income in income tax, on top of ~7-10% sales tax, property tax, and increased prices of goods from the corporate income tax, and not to mention inflation. Is it any wonder why people have no money saved and are living with enormous amounts of personal debt? </p>

<p>In the current climate, you literally work about 3-4 months a year and see no return on your work. </p>

<p>At least you have a choice if don’t want to invest your money in the stock market. Paying those taxes isn’t so voluntary. And if you do invest in the stock market in a 401k let’s say, and need to pull from it for a loan or emergency, expect that you’ll be taxed or penalized on that as well. </p>

<p>Taxation is theft. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is certainly true. I say this as a libertarian and in the interest of being politically accommodating. I think we could probably all agree on eliminating the department of defense and reallocating those resources to paying off the national debt, and funding education and health care. That’s a compromise I would fully entertain personally, even though ideologically I don’t believe the government will do a great job of managing the resources. But it would be a step in the right direction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think real anarchists are against tax at all (I do not consider ancap to be legit anarchist since wealth dictates your freedom so you literally do have masters above you). Anarchism I would say is primarily left wing, but with centrist and very moderate right flavors (anarcho-collectivism, anarcho-mutualism, etc. I think), not extreme right like ancap &quot;every man for himself&quot; bullshit.</p>

<p>Tax/gov needs reform but removing it all is not the answer (just like getting rid of the police is stupid VS just reforming it). Gov is currently heavily controlled by corporations, elite central banksters, secret societies, M.I.C. Obviously better govs have existed (less corporatist) when these factors were much smaller in strength. Gov deliberately wastes money and profit from it (crony capitalism, black budgets, generic waste, privatization of essential services like education, etc.)</p>

<p>So you have people fooled into thinking &quot;gov is stupid in making decisions, just shut it all down!!&quot; which is dumb. Maintain social and economic balance, ensuring corporations can&#39;t screw with the workers, and make gov democratically accountable to the people. The U.S. is supposed to be a constitutional representative democratic republic yet it behaves like an oligarchy (rigged primaries, corporate money in politics, currency controlled by elite central banksters, corporate media propaganda, etc.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, honest question for the sake of discussion.  What is a better alternative?</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to go to college or take student loans. Nobody is forced to go to college. You can make a great income with a skilled trade and there is always work for plumbers, electricians, framers, and construction.  These jobs often pay more than any liberal arts degree.</p>

<p>A mortgage is a good way to build equity and have a place to live. What is the alternative - rent forever, or buy the smallest shack you can save up for while renting?</p>

<p>This system is not really a conspiracy. It&#39;s a better standard of living than subsistence farming.</p>

<p>Maybe the bigger conspiracy is the university system convinced you that you needed a degree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s trickery.  You can take the easy money, food/shelter/education/city of like aged people, basically more time and hope you&#39;ll figure it out.  Then you don&#39;t look far enough down the road to see if what you&#39;re pursing is able to pay for the life you have and want.  Could have gotten roommates and gone to community college, shared a car and transit passes and worked in the field you&#39;re studying and or another to &#39;expand your horizons&#39; and not taken the flashy path.  Yea it&#39;s the boring old way, but it&#39;s the proven way that works.  Hell I knew people that got together to buy houses to live in and know that everything they improved only helped the group.  </p>

<p>But you elected to live a singular online life and invest your time to  keep or make friendships long-distance and unable to really improve your lives more than emotionally short-term.    </p>

<p>If you live in a large city you&#39;re chum unless you&#39;re c-level for a company that does some work with the government.  When you consider city/state/federal tax, some hoa&#39;s, the past 10 years combined outweigh the appreciation of what ever apartment or town-home.    </p>

<p>Combined with inflation you&#39;re barely afloat.  Only way to survive is rent it at the market rate, which exacerbates the problem</p>

<p>Why do I have a feeling all of the people who talk about this nonsense live in NYC and LA?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s basically anything within an hour commute of major cities, which happen to be where the majority of jobs in certain fields are stored.  </p>

<p>I lived an hour outside NYC, in NJ.  My grandparents bought their house for $15k in the 50&#39;s, and helped my mom with her $10k down payment for her $80k house in the 90&#39;s.  They sold their houses for $360k and $290k respectively in early 2000&#39;s.   They then bought a house near Asheville for $270k which was sold for $285k in 2015.  </p>

<p>Rent for anything within 20 minutes of where I grew up in NJ was roughly 2-3 times what a mortgage would cost but you need good credit and 20% down (20% of $250k is $50k!) to get that mortgage.  I would have had to inherit $50k just to be able to own a home in the town my family grew up in, and even then I wouldn&#39;t have profited more than 2-5% on that home&#39;s appreciation the past 20 years.  Inflation would have negated any housing market profits and gold would have been a better investment.   </p>

<p>The cities are absorbing the country.  NJ isn&#39;t much different than NC now.  Houses near Charlotte and Raleigh are also up there beyond the abilities of anyone local to afford.   </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how you got started but I didn&#39;t inherit anything and my options were rent and save.  </p>

<p>Mid/mid-high level skills will be more common globally and I reckon even high level skills (but not expressed in english) be more frequent.</p>

<p>I&#39;d imagine we would see students from developed countries moving to developing countries to study because of cheaper school fees and living costs if things keep up (I mean why not if US companies can hire those graduates, as they certainly do now).</p>

<p>Revenue generation from these skills would not be limited to developed countries anymore. If one&#39;s skills aren&#39;t better than the other 6 billion people in the world, maybe we will need to get used to living like them eventually. Equality without borders.</p>

<p>I have been working since I was 16 and most of my adult life I have typically picked up a second job for 6 months. </p>

<p>All I do is make money to keep a roof over my head, pay for my antidepressants, pay for subpar meals. I am tired, man. This sucks. I am never getting married or having kids. Decent living is not possible without a partner.  We unmarrieds have to pay exorbitant rent to live alone or take a chance on CL with a stranger. </p>

<p>Life is interesting but I feel like I pay to watch others live while I inexplicably survive.  I also feel like it&#39;s too late for the marriage and family milestones. The &quot;good until&quot; date comes for women a lot faster than men.</p>

<p>I often wish it was possible to give the time I have left to a kid with terminal cancer.</p>

<p>That was way darker than I meant it to be - I am legit really happy today, but that is the truth of how I experience life.  It isn&#39;t just the boomers. OP&#39;s post is painfully spot on.</p>

It&#39;s okay to feel the way you do, as the way I see it, that&#39;s how they&#39;ve designed you to feel. I grew up most of my life in States in the USA that had no real great outdoor landscapes then I moved to the Pacific Northwest and it has had a huge change in my personal happiness. I also am a workaholic so I trap myself indoors when I should be socializing for the same reasons, to pay rent, eat, just to exist ya know? I want you to know you arent alone, but when I go outside on hikes it I visit national parks where there are families enjoying each other&#39;s time with family while not distracted by digital devices and technology that it makes me realize it&#39;s sometimes about disconnecting and the. You realize how little you need to get by and be happy. After my first few camp trips all I felt like doing was selling everything I had and going on a minimalist explorations but of course I have to keep a job but it made me want material things much less when the outdoors and free things can be so much richer and fulfilling than money, forced societal marriages, or things you don&#39;t want to do just because society is programmed to expect those of people </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since the 70s technology has been replacing a lot of former skilled jobs. If you could but a robot to do your job better than you would probably build it and send it to replace you. That is half of what could have been wage growth. The other half is the fact you have massive quality of life improvements in the east. It was easy for a while you could just follow the herd and everyone is taken care of.

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t entirely buy what you are selling here op. If you go to <a href="/r/financialindependence">/r/financialindependence</a> or <a href="/r/leanfire">/r/leanfire</a> you can see that responsible care of finances can easily lead to retirement.</p>

<p>I mean, I understand the doom and gloom that people get in to, especially those that bought into the lie and went to college, but there are other options.</p>

<p>Take me for example. 25, 2 (about to be 3 kids), wife, rented apartment (only for another year or so), one car paid off, the other a year from being done. My income is about 100k/year before deductions. I have a technical certificate but no degree.</p>

<p>I am a welder. I guess I sort of locked out by being so poor I couldn’t afford college and too afraid to take on loans that were 3-5x my parents combined income. I ended up taking a night class to become a welder, all without knowing what welding was. Money was okay, but then I lost my job after 3 years. I moved, site unseen to a new state for the chance at a better job, and I landed a job day 1. I went into a field that had a good career outlook, seemed like it paid decent and then moved to a state with work, all things anybody with google could have done (literally my only source of research).</p>

<p>It was scary, but I did it. Now I agree, it’s still wage slavery. I work to pay for a car I barely drove and home I barely get to spend time in, but that will all change in a few years. My company pays for college (5250/year, upfront) so I will get my degree and enjoy an office job in a few years time.</p>

<p>I have so many friends who went to college and cannot find jobs, but that’s what happens when you major in women’s studies or go into a stem field with a degree from a liberal arts college. They made bad choices, I took the safe route. Everyone got sold on this idea that anybody can do anything they want.</p>

<p>Well nobody wanted to get burned a lot and work in confined spaces or hot buildings. So companies had to pay more to fill positions. I saw that and made a choice. Nobody wanted to stand knee deep in shit and work 60+ hours a week, so my BIL became a plumber and makes so much money he doesn’t even know what to do with it. He’s 32, house paid off, van paid off, has retirement set and does whatever he wants. Neither of us does what we wanted to, but we figured out that since everyone essentially has to work 40+ hours/week that we would just pick something that pas enough to not worry about bills and do what we want on time off. </p>

<p>Nobody wants to put in the work. I see it every week when we hire a new kid who has a 4 year degree but works slower than the 60 year old down the line who just does it to get out of the house. </p>

<p>I’m not blowing smoke up anyones ass. I am a guy who is watching people piss away opportunities and cry about it. I’ve managed to make a life for myself coming from a background with mediocre grades in high school and a house that was so poor we didn’t have power year round. Im not one of those geniuses that got a full ride and pulled them self out of poverty, I am just a regular dude who put in the effort.</p>

<p>My college had 19 slots in the welding class. I was at the college 1 hour before they opened the next day and ended up being #5. I put out over 40 applications for welding jobs while I was in school, and ended up being the first person in my class to land a job, and I was a crappy welder. Then I used every single break and lunch for over a year to practice welding, all in an effort to get better so I could land a better job. </p>

<p>Anybody can do what I did. After all of this I still see guys who are in better shape than me come into my job and work like it’s a vacation. They don’t move with a sense of purpose. I work with engineers that just don’t care. I spend my  breaks at work fill out our engineering change requests and working on getting better.</p>

When you move from a country like Mexico, even minimum wage in the US is a dream.

When a 1 bedroom apartment is 1200$+ you can&#39;t swing it on minimum wage, Unless you&#39;re willing to have 4 room-mates(5 total) then it&#39;s cheap.

    <div class="md"><p>Brutal, just brutally honest take on the current reality.</p>

<p>We, as a society, nationally legalized gambling via the stock markets and other &#39;financial&#39; vehicles many decades ago.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the conspiracy though? If I may state what I inferred from your post, is it possible that the consolidation of what used to be a &#39;free market&#39; economy into a handful of corporations&#39; control has become the new norm. Once this new norm became established, it was all too easy to make the healthcare sector just another legalized gambling institution via moving from non-profit to for-profit status. Are there forces pushing thru their 100 year plan to decimate the US economy as a way to bring the country to its knees?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So true and so sad people don&#39;t see it that way. It is even worse in Canada, because your medical is free the gov&#39;t robs you of pretty damn near everything else. If you buy a house, to transfer the name is $4-6,000 on a average priced home. If you buy a car the taxes are what the gov&#39;t determines not what you paid for it. If you buy a crappy house and improve the neighborhood by renovating then flipping they take 50% of your profit that you busted your ass to acheive. My LTD insurance at work is taxed! If you buy a cottage or recreational home they take 50% of any increase in value. Possibly the most taxed nation on earth. Our streets are rubble buy we have more managerial and administators than countries 10 times our size. Example, Canada has 4 times more medical administrators than Germany they have a population of 80 million we have 35. In my city of 700,000 we have 3 times the school administrators than Los Angeles which must be 4 or 5 million people. And nobody says shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The BoC is owned by the citizens of Canada and is managed on our behalf by the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>The problem isn&#39;t that the BoC is owned by The Rothschilds...the problem is that instead of providing interest free loans to the gov and being the only institution legally allowed to create new money the gov has abdicated that right and farmed it out to private banks who create new currency every time they make a &quot;loan&quot;...or...when the gov needs money they create bonds which they then turn over to banks who use those bonds to create new money which they then lend back to the gov at interest.</p>

<p>It sounds fucking insane, I know...but that&#39;s how it works.</p>

<p>Until 1974 the gov spent money into existence interest free...now they borrow it into existence at compounding interest.</p>

<p>You should check out the COMER Commission. They have been waging a legal battle against the BoC to return it back to it&#39;s original mandate...creating currency for the betterment of the citizens of Canada.</p>

<p>People in first world countries, like the United States, have no idea how good they have it. Upward mobility in a first world country is a non issue. You can work for low wages in the USA and still have a decent life, but you may not have the newest gadgests. Moving up in the US just means that now you can buy a bigger house and afford more luxuries.</p>

<p>In third world countries, upward mobility is a looming promise of something better. Because being at the bottom with your neighbors, means always worrying about food.  People in america do not go hungry. You have food pantries, food stamps, and free meals for the homeless. </p>

<p>Homeless people are a very small percent of the population that are mostly found in cities in the US. Most of the them have mental health issues.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about gadgets or buying crap you don&#39;t need (unethical marketing). But stuff like internet access and TV/entertainment are things a human being by now needs to at least somewhat enjoy their time after being crushed by a 9-5 job. Have more empathy for your fellow workers. </p>

<p>This mentality is dangerous, friend. &quot;First world countries don&#39;t know how good they got it&quot; is like saying &quot;stop complaining peasant, you&#39;re a slightly better off slave than the ones in sweatshops in China!&quot;</p>

<p>Complaining isn&#39;t even the correct word. We need to fight for real freedom, peacefully. Corporations shouldn&#39;t be this powerful where they can corrupt the gov into let them do whatever unethical activities they want like low pay, poor worker conditions and hours, dumping chemicals in rivers, spying on us for profit among other reasons, etc. (I know secret societies are also to blame.)</p>

<p>Even if you think 1% of the U.S. is homeless (ignoring the high possibility that statistics can and will lie to suit the corporate government&#39;s agenda e.g. &quot;employment has been higher than ever&quot; garbage) that&#39;s still a lot of homeless people. And even if there was just 100 homeless people in the entire U.S., one is still too many for one of the &quot;richest countries on Earth&quot;. GDP is not an indicator of how well average Americans are really doing and living standards they&#39;re facing.</p>

<p>Ignoring the poverty in the U.S. is similar to claiming &quot;poor people are poor because they&#39;re just lazy&quot; in which a huge % of the planet would be poor and yet they&#39;re not all lazy. The U.S. is rigged like the whole world is (just in different ways).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying to not be grateful (gratitude is a great thing) but rather be grateful to God or probability (or whatever) NOT the oligarch pieces of shit at the top that engineer this system to benefit them to an extreme degree at the expense of everyone else.</p>

<p>There are people far worse off than either of us in the U.S. and it makes sense to put more energy into helping the people instead of &quot;don&#39;t complain, just look at sweatshops in China&quot; nonsense which doesn&#39;t help anyone. Gratitude to God is not the same as submission to the corporatist overlord parasites.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a rat race. Don&#39;t tell the other rats &quot;shut up already, those rats are getting crushed while you&#39;re complaining about lack of shelter, man up and praise the leaders&quot;. The leaders don&#39;t have our interests at heart. Every single person on the planet can have a decent living regardless of how industrialized their country is. The main issue is how corporations (who extract resources/economic slavery), elite central banksters (who control currency) and government (who gets bribed/blackmailed by corps/banksters) damage our freedom and economic security.</p>

<p>There shouldn&#39;t need to be food banks, that&#39;s bottom of the barrel stuff. There&#39;s plenty of wealth out there to invest in non-profit social programs to generate prosperity, and enough to guarantee at least the basics for everyone. Then whoever wants above the basics can work for it (but not like a slave, imo 9-5 is too long, not enough time to spend with your children, work on a business idea, relax, live life, etc.) Workers are getting fucked so the super rich can indulge and control to psychopathic levels (this is evident with how much wealth they control).</p>

<p>plus I&#39;m not saying everyone needs to come to SDSU, they can do that in their own nearby state college.</p>

<p>also, I doubt you work in STEM, but sure, just acuse me of not working in this field, when you could easily find out that your accusation is wrong by some simple googling or even looking through my post history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Food and Housing are sunk costs. i.e. you have to pay them regardless of whether you are in school or not. Granted, if you&#39;re not working then you will go into debt, but that&#39;s a choice. If you are able to maintain extreme discipline and have zero, and I mean fucking zero social life or personal time, and the entirety of your waking existence is school and work, then you can graduate with less debt. The alternative is too graduate with debt and stress/complain about it. I worked full time while going to school and it fucking sucked. I hated every moment of it. But, I graduated with very little debt, and was able to begin enjoying life shortly after graduating, instead of stressing out about debt for 5-10 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree fully, and would say you definitely underestimated the cost of college. Its a really grim future. The amount of shit you have to pay for just in monthly expenses for insurance, car payment, phone bill, rent and dont forget the soaring price of fuel and food... is so expensive. I make okay money but its still barely enough to live on my own, if any emergency happened i would be totally fucked. I dont have a penny in savings right now. If it wasnt for donating plasma i wouldnt even be able to afford my apartment. Sadly most people are forced to take out credit cards just to pay bills and never end up paying it back, which after years i am finally almost paid off. But it aint cheap. Im paying 400 dollars a month to settle my debts. Im just glad i didnt get student loans. Literally half the people my age that i know (26 years old) are still living in their parents basement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I came from a normal household with average income and here’s my story. </p>

<p>School till 18
Community college from 19-21 (4K per year)
Public school from 21-23 (6k per year)
Normal job starting at 32k
Climbed the ladder at my job now making over six figures
Able to save for retirement, max 401K and bought house last year</p>

<p>Please tell me how the dream is dead? I just made smart financial decisions and chose to go to school close to home to save money. I worked full time while in school and because of that I graduated with minimal debt that my parents helped me with. (Under 10k in loans)</p>

<p>I worked hard when I got my job and proved myself and climbed the ladder. No nepotism, just hard work and dedication. </p>

<p>Not saying that it’s easy for everyone, but believe it or not you don’t need to spend 100k on college. It only gets your foot in the door of your first job (obviously this doesn’t apply to STEM degrees etc but that’s a decision you make). </p>

<p>Nothing pisses me off more than these posts, it discredits the hard work that myself and other people in my situation have done. Don’t take that away from us because you’re jaded. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that many people are taking that path, and I also believe that it&#39;s unfortunate. </p>

<p>But you have to look at history to understand how we got here. It wasn&#39;t because the banks and Wall Street attempted to enslave us. It is because <em>WE</em> demanded access to better things. And to get access to those things we needed access to capitol. And access to capitol is what made the US a world superpower and made the standard of living for every American rise. </p>

<p>Access to capitol changed all that. </p>

<p>Home ownership went to under 40% to almost 70% </p>

<p>College Graduation went from less then 3% in 1900 to over 25% today (Not counting Associates or Trade) </p>

<p>All this happened because the middle class was granted <em>Access to capitol</em>. </p>

<p>Now the downside is debt. Yes, 100 years ago our ancestors had very little or no debt. But they also didn&#39;t own anything and didn&#39;t have an education. </p>

<p>If you want to see a community that has no education and no assets go to any inner city. And, this may surprise you, inner city families have the least debt of all demographics, because they have no access to capitol and therefore no large amounts of debt. </p>

<hr/>

<p>I agree that the system is rigged and has flaws. And that is what this sub is for. To put a spotlight on the bullshit and start a discussion about the problems. </p>

<p>But access to capitol is not a problem. It&#39;s a good thing and we fought for it for centuries. Just because some people have a hard time managing it doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s a bad thing. It has it flaws that need to be worked out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, this is just a place for my stuff, ya know? That&#39;s all; a little place for my stuff. That&#39;s all I want, that&#39;s all you need in life, is a little place for your stuff, ya know? I can see it on your table, everybody&#39;s got a little place for their stuff. This is my stuff, that&#39;s your stuff, that&#39;ll be his stuff over there<br/>
That&#39;s all you need in life, a little place for your stuff. That&#39;s all your house is- a place to keep your stuff. If you didn&#39;t have so much stuff, you wouldn&#39;t need a house. You could just walk around all the time. A house is just a pile of stuff with a cover on it. You can see that when you&#39;re taking off in an airplane. You look down, you see everybody&#39;s got a little pile of stuff. All the little piles of stuff. And when you leave your house, you gotta lock it up. Wouldn&#39;t want somebody to come by and take some of your stuff. They always take the good stuff. They never bother with that crap you&#39;re saving. All they want is the shiny stuff. That&#39;s what your house is, a place to keep your stuff while you go out and get...more stuff! Sometimes you gotta move, gotta get a bigger house. Why? No room for your stuff anymore<br/>
Did you ever notice when you go to somebody else&#39;s house, you never quite feel a hundred percent at home? You know why? No room for your stuff. Somebody else&#39;s stuff is all over the goddamn place! And if you stay overnight, unexpectedly, they give you a little bedroom to sleep in. Bedroom they haven&#39;t used in about eleven years. Someone died in it, eleven years ago. And they haven&#39;t moved any of his stuff! Right next to the bed there&#39;s usually a dresser or a bureau of some kind, and there&#39;s no room for your stuff on it. Somebody else&#39;s shit is on the dresser...Have you noticed that their stuff is shit, and your shit is stuff? God! And you say, &quot;Get that shit off of there and let me put my stuff down!&quot;<br/>
Sometimes you leave your house to go on vacation. And you gotta take some of your stuff with you. Gotta take about two big suitcases full of stuff, when you go on vacation. You gotta take a smaller version of your house. It&#39;s the second version of your stuff. And you&#39;re gonna fly all the way to Honolulu. Gonna go across the continent, across half an ocean to Honolulu. You get down to the hotel room in Honolulu and you open up your suitcase and you put away all your stuff. &quot;Here&#39;s a place here, put a little bit of stuff there, put some stuff here, put some stuff- you put your stuff there, I&#39;ll put some stuff- here&#39;s another place for stuff, look at this, I&#39;ll put some stuff here.&quot; And even though you&#39;re far away from home, you start to get used to it, you start to feel okay, because after all, you do have some of your stuff with you<br/>
That&#39;s when your friend calls up from Maui, and says, &quot;Hey, why don&#39;tcha come over to Maui for the weekend and spend a couple of nights over here.&quot; Oh, no! Now what do I pack? Right, you&#39;ve gotta pack an even smaller version of your stuff. The third version of your house. Just enough stuff to take to Maui for a coupla days. You get over to Maui- I mean you&#39;re really getting extended now, when you think about it. You got stuff all the way back on the mainland, you got stuff on another island, you got stuff on this island. I mean, supply lines are getting longer and harder to maintain<br/>
You get over to your friend&#39;s house on Maui and he gives you a little place to sleep, a little bed right next to his windowsill or something. You put some of your stuff up there. You put your stuff up there. You got your Visine, you got your nail clippers, and you put everything up. It takes about an hour and a half, but after a while you finally feel okay, say, &quot;All right, I got my nail clippers, I must be okay.&quot; That&#39;s when your friend says, &quot;Aaaaay, I think tonight we&#39;ll go over the other side of the island, visit a pal of mine and maybe stay over.&quot; Aww, no. NOW what do you pack? Right- you gotta pack an even SMALLER version of your stuff. The fourth version of your house. Only the stuff you know you&#39;re gonna need. Money, keys, comb, wallet, lighter, hanky, pen, smokes, rubber and change. Well, only the stuff you HOPE you&#39;re gonna need </p>

<p>But yes that is exactly what they don&#39;t want. Similarly, they want people to buy into the retirement scheme bullshit, not pass their ENTIRE retirement onto their kids. They want you to be selfish and hoard it so you can live a meager existence off of it because &quot;you earned it&quot;. Well luckily Chinese aren&#39;t buying into that, so I predict they will be ahead of us in a few decades, because they pass their &quot;retirement&quot; onto their children and their children take care of them in return.
