    <div class="md"><p>They very well could just let it all go to hell. We just need to be smarter than them and realize not to pull the trigger just because they tell us to. Evil obviously attracts evil, maybe the evil is starting to realize that nobody wants to join their side anymore therefore their numbers are dwindling like you said. They’re probably going to ruin things on purpose as a last chance power grab to try to keep this shit going but pass it down to like minds like them. But Because no one wants to adapt to their shitty behavior and lifestyle they’re going to be snuffed out. Even some of these rich oligarchs kids don’t want to carry-on their mission. Ever seen the Johnson and johnson documentary? Even the owner of that companys son (jaime) doesn’t want to carry-on with the level of greed/control that his family has been building. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am at work and my thoughts will be scattered considering but please try to look past that. I am not into the Bible but I think there is truth behind it. There is something extremely important about the numbers 9 and 10. I believe we are about to experience the earths “9” phase. </p>

<p>Anton LaVey, church of Satan founder, said that he devils number is 9. Because it’s the number that always comes back to itself. </p>

<p>For example, 9x3 = 27.    2+7=9. or 9x9= 81.   8+1=9.
666 = 6+6+6= 18. 1+8=9. (Sacred Geometry) </p>

<p>If you notice Windows went from windows 8 to 10. iPhone went from iPhone 8 to iPhone 10(X). They skip the number 9. What are they alluding to? What is it they want to avoid so desperately? Why do they want to skip whatever 9 represents so badly? In the Bible the number 10 represents the completed course of time or the completed course in divine order. </p>

<p>We are slowly coming into the age of 9 so to speak. Politicians are slowly being exposed for being pedophiles. People are seeing strange phenomena in the skies. There are record shattering natural disasters happening back to back. The Federal Emergency Management(FEMA) is preparing to setup a nationwide alert system should anything crazy happen. The elite are building doomsday bunkers and telling people about it. Almost like they don’t care if we know at this point. </p>

<p>You can clearly see they have stopped investing in America so to speak. Homelessness is rampant. Music sucks. Movies suck. Good singers and actors have disappeared. Apocalyptic movies have become the norm. The list goes on. </p>

<p>Then you have the X-Men. In 1991 Robert Harrington discovered a planet called Planet X and he surprisingly died 6 months later. Then in 1992 they released a new X-Men series. </p>

<p>Go to this website and look at the X-Men timeline <a href="http://xmenmovies.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline">http://xmenmovies.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline</a> </p>

<p>What’s crazy is if you google the events that happen in X-Men they actually happened in real life. Down to the date. Then they come out with a show called “the gifted” that has nothing to do with X-men yet the X-men are a part of the series. However, apparently they don’t appear because they have “disappeared to go on space missions.” </p>

<p>My girlfriend saw what looked like a planet a few days ago and told me to go outside to look at it. A few moments later it disappeared. The chem trails somehow hide it most of the time. However, the changes it’s making to the world are quite obvious. It should be 70 degrees where I live but it’s 90. There was weird black smoke covering the skies today. The earth is heating up at an alarming rate and the government knows it. </p>

<p>In summary, there is something significant about everything that is going on right now. I haven’t put the pieces together yet. I know this is poorly put together and you most likely think I’m insane but I’m telling you there are humans here that have dormant X genes and that planet is somehow associated with it. Human evolution is coming into a new phase. In order for it to happen the world as we know it must “die” so to speak. There is a reason there is so many magic based/superhero movies coming out. </p>

<p>It’s also a reason why in the new venom trailer the doctor says “humans are on the brink of extinction, this (venom symbiote) is the next step in human evolution.”  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s just your opinion lol I&#39;ve been able to go to more crowded raves in the last 2 years than in my whole life </p>

<p>EDM now is better than music ever before, I know there&#39;s a growing disdain for edm for some reason, but big labels can&#39;t sell it and it&#39;s all self-propelled.. so ofcourse the media wants you to think that music sucks, while indy artists are using bare bones tools and no producer to make the best tunes yet</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s quite obvious at this point. What’s really weird is, there are multiple movies/shows that hint as being robots. The common theme is.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They think they are humans</p></li>
<li><p>Some big event happens</p></li>
<li><p>They realize they were robots the entire time</p></li>
<li><p>They eventually learn the truth and realize they have had their memories wiped and/or consistently have their memories wiped. </p></li>

<p>Do you consider yourself managed or controlled by tornado sirens or fire alarms?  It&#39;s another piece to the emergency alert system, just like what already blares out regularly from the radio, TV, and sirens.  But it&#39;s 2018 and it&#39;s increasingly common for households to have multiple cell phones but no TVS or radios.  I really don&#39;t understand the suspicion over this test or the alert system.</p>
