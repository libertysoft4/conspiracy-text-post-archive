<p>The founders of this nation never thought all people were qualified to vote. Some people have more of a vested interest in what happens in the nation. That is why the land owning restriction was originally in place. Today with the way cities are structured this type of restriction would be impossible.</p>

<p>But we can both agree something needs to be done, what can we do to prevent another Trump from being elected? What can we do to get our country back? We need to stand up for true American values of Freedom liberty and justice based on what the founders envisioned not what social justice Warriors and the diversity industry envision</p>

<p>Who determines this all powerful council of &quot;respected and qualified elders&quot;? It sounds like something out of Harry Potter.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a pretty intense exam - and how would we administer it? Who determines what &quot;conflicting propaganda&quot; gets used in this exam? And who determines what is a lie and a contradiction? This sub is a perfect example of: One man&#39;s propaganda is another man&#39;s red pill.</p>

<p>We are <em>all</em> swayed by emotion. It&#39;s called being human. </p>

<p>Your idea is, by definition, discriminatory and dangerous. It&#39;s based off of a perceived set of expectations of a &quot;qualified voter&quot; that would change constantly (certainly from administration to administration) depending on who is handing out these orders to determine who is eligible and who is not. </p>

<p>Your belief hinges on the requirement that some entity (the government?) makes a decision based on a specific set of guidelines or principles. You don&#39;t see how that could be misused? (For the record, America has done that...it didn&#39;t work out too well).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can’t think of a way of doing it, because who gets to decide who is worthy of a vote? I could say we’ll only allow votes forpeople who are more likely to vote for people like me, so we can all entrench our wealth and power etc. You could have some kind of test you have to pass to be allowed to vote, but then who gets to decide what’s on the test? I think the best way of improving democracy would be getting rid of 2 party systems and enabling more proportional representation so that people feel free to vote with their beliefs rather than being forced to vote tactically. Then government would be more of a coalition working together really representing the people instead of just 2 parties that end up taken over by financial military interests etc, and pursue essentially the same policies that destroy everything for the majority. All types of democracy have their issues though and there are def problems with PR just fewer I think than what the US has now.</p>

<p>Anarcho - is the belief that the laws and power of governments should be replaced by people working together freely.</p>

<p>Monarchy - undivided rule or absolute sovereignty by a single person</p>

<p>You have to admit that without further exposition those two ideas seem contradictory. </p>

<p>A voluntary monarchy? How will it remain voluntary? What enforces the rules the monarch creates? What if the monarch has a shitty kid and that kid runs the kingdom into the ground? Thats a story that has happened time and time again. </p>

<p>Well democracy and socialism have meanings of course, duh. But when someone references socialism it typically makes reference to one or more tenets of socialism or democracy. </p>

<p>You for instance wouldnt say anarcho socialism is a capitalism with a an elected head of state, right? That would be dumb and confusing. </p>

<p>Much like saying an anarcho monochary has the tenets of anarchy with none of the tenets of a monarchy, right? Because that would just be dumnb. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t like Trump, but you ABSOLUTELY SHOULD&#39;T give up democratic norms and rights in order to avoid a bad leader.  All Governments allow for bad leaders.  One of the great things about America is that, at most, our bad leaders are limited to eight years.  Compare that to monarchies and dictators where bad leaders can ruin their countries for decades.  </p>

<p>I absolutely think some electoral and political reforms should be made, but the goal of those reforms should be to make our government more democratic, more accountable to all people, not less so.</p>

You feeling you&#39;re better than most proves nothing, and certainly solves nothing. Next to Einstein, you&#39;re likely an idiot as well. If you judge a fishes ability by the way it climbs a tree, then your test isn&#39;t proving anything.

<p>Luckily it&#39;s not so bad here yet that people like you and me are still allowed to post. Imagine if you had to take an aptitude test to see if you were allowed to Reddit ... and imagine if it was written in hieroglyphics... would you be above the required 70, or would you look dumb? </p>
