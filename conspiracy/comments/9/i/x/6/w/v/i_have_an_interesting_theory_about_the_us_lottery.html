        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>whenever you see lottery you might be tempted to get tickets and try you luck at winning millions. What if these lottery companies(Mega Millions,PowerBall) purposely have no winning ticket. what I mean by that is when you pick your own numbers you go up to the counter they have to put the numbers into the machine and print out the ticket. similarly to when picking random numbers. once they have the number of tickets they pick a number combination that no one will have so more people would buy more tickets. That would explain why in recent years the top prize will surpass 300 million often. the higher the Jackpot is the more tickets that they would sell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>a rich person knows $2 to win $100+ million is a fantastic &quot;investment&quot; and if you dont win its only $2. Rich people also know that spending $100+ twice weekly doesnt increase your odds any and dont do that unlike some of the poor that you hear about being dumbasses and going broke on the lottery. Its in no way rigged just because a rich person happens to win it, nor is is a sign of it being rigged because a rich person refuses to spend pocket change on it.</p>

He needed to get paid asap so I went to the casino and played  roulette for the first time in my life. In an hour I had $5,000 then lost $300 in 10 minutes, I cashed out with $4,700 and have never been back. Saved my reputation and probably my business because I did not get paid for that job for another 3 weeks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>tickets are sold up to an hour before the drawing, youre suggesting that they collate EVERY possible number combination sold, determine which number combos will be losers across the country, rig up the air machine/selector, in under an hours time?</p>

<p>In all seriousness though it can be rigged and we do have examples of it being so. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvYAiGe3cn4">Check this out.</a> Granted that example was in Serbia.</p>

<p>I honestly think the lotto is just another tax on the poor and working class. It&#39;s voluntary but still a &quot;tax&quot; nonetheless. Best bet it to go with scratch offs but don&#39;t get too carried away. Realistically, the majority of people would blow their winnings if they ever won it big anyways. Talk about a double kick in the nuts to win millions and end up poor again.</p>

<p>powerball increased their ticket price to $2 per ticket a while back but also added 10 more numbers to the drawing. </p>

<p>more losers paying more per ticket = larger jackpots rolling over to the next drawing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are being fooled worse to buy the tickets when the jackpot is high.  When it&#39;s high everyone is buying a ticket meaning you are more likely to split the prize several ways.  When it&#39;s not crazy high you still have the same small chances to winning but you are more likely to walk away with it all rather than splitting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In theory they could be rigged since all numbers are  put in a computer be fire the draw. The purchase cutoff time also helps this theory since the main one can poll the other computers and they can then select the winning numbers at will. Once the que is full it will pick a jackpot winning number at random. This us extremely possible with the Powerball machine which could have an array of balls released by solenoids hidden in the ball path as the numbers in the bowl move too fast to accurately identify both the numbers left or the count present. Plausable. </p>
