        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Remember that for the first 200 years of our (U.S.) history schooling was cheap, competitive and voluntary and if our sensational accomplishments are to be believed, quite successful. School was everywhere considered a good thing, but absolutely nowhere considered a very essential thing because it was common knowledge then that learning to read write and do arithmetic are easy things to learn, even on one&#39;s own and even by the poor, with little work. And they are not terribly difficult to become proficient at, either. People, it was widely understood, could grow up bright, alert, decent, competent and prosperous  - even scholarly and profound - without much schooling at all. The idea of people sitting in a chair year-round would have been thought insane.</p>

<p>This decentralized and locally driven form of schooling began to change in the mid-19th century when American academics became enamored with Prussian schools. Prussia, a modern day Sparta organized for constant warfare, purposefully designed its school system to create obedient soldiers, workers, and civil servants. Thomas Alexander wrote in 1919: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;The Prussian is to a large measure enslaved through the medium of his school his learning instead of making him his own master forges the chain by which he is held in servitude the whole scheme of Prussian elementary education is shaped with the express purpose of making ninety five out of every hundred citizens subservient to the ruling house and to the state.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Re-read that quote and understand this time that Prussian elementary schools are what the American education system is still based on.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered what the best people thought as they watched the new institution of compulsory schooling unfold in the last half of the nineteenth century, and what they thought as they watched its first phalanx of graduates take their place in the world? Herbert Spencer, the great British Philosopher and publicist of Darwinism, wrote a remarkable book entitled <em>Education</em> in the early 1860&#39;s in which he pronounced  government schooling a preposterous endeavor doomed to failure. He said that this would happen because it deprived children of raw experience and responsibility precisely at the moment their natural development demanded it, and that this experience and responsibility could not be made up for later. in 1867 a prominent American physician, Vincent Youmans, argued before the London College of Preceptors that the new system was the creation of lunatics: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;It produces mental perversion and absolute stupidity, it produces bodily disease. It produces these things by measures which operate to the prejudice of the growing brain. It is not to be doubted that dullness, in-docility, and viciousness are taught by the lessons of school.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reflecting on this new system of American public education, famed philosopher and logician Charles S. Peirce wrote in the 1870’s:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Let the will of the state act, then, instead of that of the individual. Let an institution be created which shall have for its object to keep correct doctrines before the attention of the people, to reiterate them perpetually, and to teach them to the young; having at the same time power to prevent contrary doctrines from being taught, advocated, or expressed. Let all possible causes of a change of mind be removed from men&#39;s apprehensions. Let them be kept ignorant, lest they should learn of some reason to think otherwise than they do…Then, let all men who reject the established belief be terrified into silence.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The author of the famous book <em>Parkman&#39;s Journal</em> spoke out in 1880, saying: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Schools have not borne fruit on which we have cause to congratulate ourselves.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>From 1860 to 1880 there is no evidence in the historical record that a golden age of government monopoly schooling existed. If there ever was one it had to occur after those years.</p>

<p>In 1885 the president of Columbia University spoke as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;The results obtained under our present system of instruction are neither very flattering nor very encouraging.&quot;</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1895 the president of Harvard said this: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Ordinary schooling, by confining children to books and withdrawing their attention from visible objects, renders the senses useless. It produces dumbness. A young man whose intellectual powers are worth cultivating cannot be willing to cultivate them by pursuing the phantoms the schools insist upon.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When those words were spoken, monopoly schooling was approaching its fiftieth year as a new institution, but still no signs of a golden age were about. School was producing <em>&quot;dumbness&quot;</em> in the quaint language of the time. </p>

<p>Jumping ahead thirty-five years to 1930 we find the subject of the high-powered annual Inglis Lecture at Harvard to be public schooling. Its central thesis was this: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;We have absolutely nothing to show for our colossal investment in common schooling after eighty years of trying.&quot;</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Absolutely nothing</strong>. As far as Cambridge was concerned the Golden Age, if it exists, must lie beyond 1930, it certainly can&#39;t be before that date.</p>

<p>On the lip of our own age, John Gardner&#39;s <em>Annual Report to the Carnegie Operation</em>, in 1960, said this: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;The emphasis upon formal schooling has been exaggerated beyond all reason... the failure to see constructive alternatives is leading us into deeper and deeper absurdities. Too many young people gain nothing except the conviction they are misfits.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems if we are to find a Golden Age to justify a government monopoly on the way young people think, to justify a government monopoly on the way they grow up, to justify the government monopoly on what they are told the purpose of existence is, then we must search for that justification in the years from 1960 to the present. Unless we find a Golden Age there after 142 years of trying, isn&#39;t it time to say, <em>&quot;Enough!&quot;</em>?</p>

<p>Well, there is a Golden Age there, but not the kind the public might expect as its due. In inflation adjusted dollars we now spend four times more than we did in 1930; it has been a golden Age without parallel for schoolmen and school suppliers and local politicians. A golden river overflowing its banks. Millions of people make an excellent living on the backs of 40 million young lives forced into government containers, tens of thousands of suppliers grow quite rich this way, independent of what happens to the  children. It is the best of businesses: exclusive, unfailingly profitable, undemanding, and guaranteed year after year by the power of the state. Where in the America of the Bill of Rights and the Revolution is such an institution part of the covenant?</p>

<p><strong>TLDR:</strong></p>

<p><em>“The simplistic notion that “our schools are failing” easily translates into a limitless demand for more resources for the institution and its supports: for books, for teachers, for computers, for real estate (and hence for book publishers, graduate schools of education, computer manufacturers, and real estate developers) — and for more time: for more pre-school, more homework, longer school years, the end of recess, and semi- (and soon fully) compulsory summer schools. The truth is that no matter how much is expended in the educational marketplace, 50% of the  schools will remain &#39;below average&#39;, with those branded as poor performers changing from year to year and those above the mid-point fearing, above all, that they will fall into the abyss. And thus a zero sum game is achieved as the people feel the only response to a fall into sub-mediocrity is to buy one’s way out.&quot;</em> </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/cDGU9Gx">Ellwood P. Cubberly</a> was dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Education and a key player in the field of educational administration during the first half of the 20th century. Cubberly also served as chief of elementary school textbooks at publishing company Houghton Mifflin, and there is no doubt he heavily influenced what school children learn in this country. </p>

<p>In 1934 Cubberly bragged in <em>Public Education in the United States</em> that compulsory schooling is designed to extend childhood by two to six years. Indeed, Cubberley viewed school as a giant social engineering project; he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“Our schools are...factories in which the raw products (children) are to be shaped and fashioned.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A close personal contact of Cubberly’s was a Harvard professor named Dr. Alexander Inglis. Inglis wrote a famous book in 1918 called <em>Principles of Secondary Education</em>. In this book, he outlines the true goals of public school. </p>

<p><strong>They include:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The adjustive or adaptive function - teaching kids to accept and respect authority.</p></li>
<li><p>The integrating function - making every one alike. </p></li>
<li><p>The diagnostic and directive function - determining each student’s social role/class.  </p></li>
<li><p>The selective function - helping along the evolutionary process by using grades, demerits, peer pressure, etc. to mark and ostracize those deemed ‘unfit’ or unwilling to conform.</p></li>
<li><p>The propaedeutic function - identifying the next generation of elites and teaching them how the system really works.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you think Inglis’ book is outdated, or merely the ramblings of one eccentric professor, think again. Inglis was in charge of all secondary school textbooks at Houghton Mifflin. Furthermore, his book was cited as the definitive analysis of public schools by James Bryant Conant. Conant was president of Harvard University for over twenty years, a key member of the Manhattan Project, and United States High Commissioner for Germany from 1953–57, so his opinion carries weight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As society rapidly changes, individuals will have to
be able to function comfortably in a world that is
always in flux. Knowledge will continue to increase
at a dizzying rate. This means that a content-based
curriculum, with a set body of information to be
imparted to students, is entirely inappropriate as a
means of preparing children for their adult roles.</p>

<p>People will be faced with greater individual responsibility
to direct their own lives. Children must grow
up in an environment that stresses self-motivation
and self -assessment. Schools that focus on external
motivating factors, such as rewards and punishments
for meeting goals set by others, are denying
children the tools they need most to survive.</p>

<p>Children have an immense capacity for concentration
and hard work when they are passionate about
what they are doing, and the skills they acquire in
any area of interest are readily transferable to other
fields. Schools must thus become far more tolerant
of individual variation and far more reliant on selfinitiated
activities.</p>

<p>Realistically though, home based education is not the experiment, it&#39;s how people learned to function in the world for centuries, and there is no reason to believe that people today can&#39;t do the same thing. Compulsory schooling is the experiment, not the lack of it, and that experiment is undoubtedly in trouble. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know why your so hostile, its not that i don&#39;t know who she is it&#39;s that I don&#39;t feel I know enough about this person to give you an accurate summation of my feelings on them would you rather I lie?</p>

<p>As for your other question, well since you&#39;ve already indicated to me you don&#39;t like to read longer posts I guess you can just ignore the rest of this.</p>

<p>Imagine if we taught kids how to ride a bike the way we try to teach them how to have a career.</p>

<p>We’d start by showing them pictures of a bike when they’re young. We’d teach them to say the word bike, then spell it, then write it neatly. We’d have them draw a picture of a bike. We’d have them measure the perimeter of a picture of a bike. We’d have them write stories about people riding bikes. We’d ask them to share what kind of bike they want when they grow up.</p>

<p>When they reached their teens, every once in a while someone would show them a real bike and describe what riding it is like. They wouldn’t be allowed to touch it, and certainly not to own or ride one. In fact, anyone who let them would be subject to serious legal trouble. Then, after seventeen or eighteen years of this (never more or less), we’d have a big ceremony congratulating them and ourselves at their successful completion of bike riding prep.</p>

<p>They’d be allowed to ride now, but it would be looked down upon. Instead, they’d be encouraged to hone their skills and really learn to ride by paying tens of thousands of dollars to spend the next four years getting drunk and hearing specialized bike-related knowledge. They’d hear the history of bikes, mostly from professors who hate bikes. They’d hear about the ecosystem where the rubber trees grow that go into bike tires, except any connection between that ecosystem and the actual building and riding of bikes would be deemed in poor taste. They’d learn a great many other things and come away with a certificate declaring their level of bike preparedness.</p>

<p>We’d celebrate. Then they’d be dropped off in the middle of the highway and told, &quot;Congratulations, now ride!&quot;</p>

<p>If at any point in this decades-long process a child decided they’d learned all they needed, quit, and picked up a bike to start riding, it would be deemed a miserable failure. Even though the stated goal is to get them riding, it’s not their ability to ride that determines the success of the system, only the number of students who complete it. Figuring out how to ride and riding before the appointed time is a sign of trouble and rebellion, and would be discouraged at all costs.</p>

<p>This is obviously a stupid way to teach bike-riding, yet it’s how we train kids for life.</p>

<p>Imagine kids blending learning with working from the time they were ready and willing to work. Imagine kids moving from reading to doing the same way they go from training wheels to two wheels – quickly, and often without a lot of fanfare or even a clear-cut transition. Imagine allowing some skinned knees, some wobbly attempts, some bumping into the neighbors mailbox while trying to figure out how to navigate the world. Think of the sheer joy and freedom kids experience when they can fly through the neighborhood on two wheels, and imagine how much greater when they can create value, exchange, cooperate, buy and sell on their own ability and will.</p>

<p>Instead, we force kids into a simulated world for decades, then celebrate their completion of our programs, regardless of whether they’ve actually gained what they need to succeed. Then we let them wander the world for the first time, trying to learn in months what we prohibited them from trying for years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>School also serves the function of subsidized child care. If we cut down the school year who watches the kids? Tax benefits for homeschooling erodes the funds necessary for the other changes you’re a talking about. Leaving things up to local government leaves open the opportunity for huge factual inaccuracies (creationism vs science.) You end up with some places having drastically different areas of focus or understand. A fractured population is a difficult one to work with/within. We are already seeing the early stages of that now. </p>

<p>And I agree about common core but a free market creates many new systems with different values and ways to measure success. Are colleges going to have to interpret each of these different methods of assessment or would it be easier to create a type of standardized system to work within? Not saying your ideas are bad but the problems get really complicated when talking about complete overhaul. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we’re talking about assumptions, your model assumes that all students have the same capacity and ability to be job ready by 18. What about the kids with disabilities, school avoidance,  anxiety, or plain ole apathy. There are a zillion factors that could impact an individuals ability to join the workforce. I agree that there is no one right way to learn, but the open ended model leaves a lot more room for misses than hits. It also assumes an economy where there are enough jobs that pay above minimum wage for all these kids to obtain. I doubt John Q. Businessman is going to want to gamble a salary and 401k on some 18 year old when other options are available. College may not be necessary but people will always look for ways to differentiate themselves. I don’t see higher education going away soon. </p>

<p>Sure, kids from parents with an education or the resources to ensure a quality upbringing will have  a better chance; but even then there are a lot of duds. Then the other side of that coin is parent(s) who rely on somebody else to raise their children because they are unwilling/unable to do so themselves. I’m not saying our current system is perfect, although I did have four slices of vegetables for dinner tonight. Go health! </p>

<p>The real trouble comes from the funding model. Without a complete revamp of how schools are paid for, it will always be the case of the haves vs have nots. Even if we somehow convince the 1% to pay for the other 99, those with the checkbook will want some say in the content and method of delivery. Your original point was correct, the system is working exactly how it was designed to work. Unfortunately a clear alternative does not exist on a national level at this point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>More funding does not translate into higher levels of academic success we are spending much more than we did in the past and children are more functionally illiterate then they have ever been, apathy is derived from a lack of being able to pursue ones true passions, which is in no way being helped by the current system (arguably it is being worsened) it would cost far less to reduce the bureacracy of schooling by bringing it to the local level considering 75% of allotted funds don&#39;t even reach the classroom and are spent instead on administrative fees (homeschoolers currently cost nothing to the state), no the free market solution would not be perfect but it would certainly allow for more potential solutions then the guaranteed demonstrable failure we have now</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I postulated that as simply a potential outcome it is not imo necessary but it could be as simple as a tax credit so home schoolers at an amount set to less than what is currently being by the state to educate each student per year on average (for 2014 that amount was $12,157 so anything less than that would be a net gain)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This would require cuts somewhere. Who do you axe first, custodians, art/band, math? We’re spending more because inflation and the value of the dollar is garbage compared to the past. My grandma paid a nickel for candy, in her lifetime a bag of Skittles have gone up 200%. </p>

<p>Either that or we completely blow up public schooling. That would have to be a gradual process, what’s our first step as a nation in doing this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I stated in my original post the massive increase in costs is inflation adjusted, are you implying that school serving as a jobs program for otherwise uneeded employees should take precedent over children receiving an optimal education suited to their individual drives? If teachers who instruct children on how to function in the real world can&#39;t even find a job themselves outside of a government guaranteed pay check then it seems we have truly made a grave misstep, and yes a complete dissolution of public schooling would be optimal imo, there are many routes that could take some of which I have already covered, the massive flaws still exist regardless</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many jobs exist because of schooling. You’re not just talking about getting rid of teachers, nor are you hiding your bias against them. It is a difficult uphill battle if you start pitting people against each other. </p>

<p>Custodians, food service providers, transportation, school suppliers, textbook companies, coaches, builders, engineers, and many others would be out of a job. </p>

<p>What job should they all go get in this newly hostile job market you created? They would be competing against all the job-ready students you just pumped out, and all of the college educated individuals whose jobs are now obsolete. How do you see that playing out. </p>

<p>Many jobs existed back when we needed telephone switch operators and elevator attendants, should we have maintained those as well? Should we just continue on the same course then so that people are enusured a government check even if it&#39;s at the expense of children&#39;s well being? What are YOUR solutions? We could pay them to dig holes and then fill them up instead?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn’t the one who posted a wall of gibberish but claims not to know about the person currently responsible for running all of it.</p>

<p>I haven’t made any type of argument to say we should maintain the status quo, nor has my line of questioning tried to diminish the failures of our current system. Turning this back on me is not the solution either, but similar things often happen in real life and we end up with the gridlock we currently find ourselves in. </p>

<p>I’m simply pointing out that facilitating real change is a lot more complicated than posting on message boards. In your current line of work are you actively working to help bring about the changes you desire or are you just screaming into the void? Otherwise none of this really matters. </p>
