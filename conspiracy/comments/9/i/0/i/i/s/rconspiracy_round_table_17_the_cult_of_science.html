    <div class="md"><p>Would love to start the discussion:</p>

<p>The scientific community is more political than scientific. Universities and firms responsible for research are basically gag ordered by government funding and corporate grants. Almost each and every peer reviewed study in the community has edited data to conform to a predetermined hypothesis to keep the funding rolling in. You cant publish anything that may threaten large corporations or governments.</p>

<p>Lets analyze to basic example as to why this is. Ex. A, A small reaserch firm focused on biomedical sciences whose funding stems from corporate grants from a large pharmaceutical company is conducting a study for a new drug that helps cancer patients live longer if they are terminal. During the study, they find that certain types of cancers can be targeted and be turned benign. A corporate plant in the firm reviews the data and promptly destroys the data and reports the findings to the company who swiftly revokes funding from the firm. The genuine scientists that made the discovery and threatened and forced into  obscurity.</p>

<p>Another good example would be an inventor who works for a motor company finds that he can produce an engine that can derive its fuel from simple saline water. He can be swiftly terminated from his position and his inventions confiscated due to national security threates and he is then thrust into obscurity even if he tries to distribute his findings.</p>

<p>These are just basic examples of why true revolutionary innovation in the scientific community is not allowed. If ypu find something groundbrwaking enough you may even be killed. Its truly holding humanity back and it is a tragedy that governmental and corporate interests are superceding earth changing technology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think its important to make a distinction between the current embodiment of Science and it&#39;s institutions and scientists working within much of it.</p>

<p>I think vast majority of the scientists working in this system actually really really want to do good, they want to make real progress happen. But the incentives are toxic, and those who fulfill them rise up in the chain while those who stick up for their morals are reprimanded as such.</p>

<p>The human will is there, its a matter of bringing it out. </p>

<p>We currently don&#39;t understand how powerful we are, but that the time for that to change is coming. Not in any like woo woo we can learn to fly with our brains sort of thing, but in the way that once we understand the underlying structure of our universe the power to imagine and bring thought to reality takes a whole new meaning.</p>

<p>Computers can&#39;t imagine, and our system does not incentivize imagination in any way shape or form, part of the toxic system that currently is in place. </p>

<p>But people want to imagine, we just need to bring it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You nailed it. I am heavy into anthropology/archaeology and the like... anyone who steps out of line in this field and reports findings that don&#39;t fit a narrow view has their &quot;careers&quot; ruined in an instant and are mocked... even if they are coming from a completely &quot;scientific&quot; place with hard facts and well thought out theories. In the long run so many of these forward thinkers have been proven right. It&#39;s the same in any field that relies on funding from corporations, universities, etc... all highly political atmospheres where truth doesn&#39;t really matter. The status quo does because it&#39;s obviously working damn well for them.</p>

<p>So yeah... never underestimate what a person will do when their meal ticket or fragile ego is at stake.</p>

<p>Its hard to give an idea of what might have been, but I think the general state of the field, with huge amounts of complexity and productivity but little creativity points to this type of thinking having been happening for a while</p>

<p>Can you explain what you mean by this? Peer review is specifically important so different programs under different funding can confirm or debunk a study. Peer study is exactly the process used to eliminate &quot;edited data to conform to a predetermined hypothesis.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are in a metaphysical crisis. The previous sign regimes of the west, specifically Christianity embodied in the image of Christ, have been washed away and replaced with new symbols.  The emblem of the cross has been superseded by flashing electric images of advertisers and Hollywood showman.</p>

<p>We are witnessing the dawning of a new religious order following the Nietzschean &quot;death of god&quot;. The metaphysical crisis of our age was born well over one hundred years ago. We could place the pin at many events but these things happen in stages.</p>

<p>The electric age as it evolved brought about both the death of god, and the dawning of a new faith. The scientist of today has much in common with the priest of the past. Similar vestments even. Religion always dawns out of who has the answers to critical questions about the movement of the stars. The first astrologers who could calculate a eclipse secured the power of that guild of star gazers for millennia. Today our scientists grapple with the same questions that priests and shamans grappled with. What is life? How is it formed? And how did the world come to be? When understood it this way the theories that attempt to define the world around us, specifically evolution and the big Bang Theory are nothing more than modern day creation myths. </p>

<p>The flaws in the data of both theories are well known to the average scientist. In the big bang a failure to account for the possibility of a infinite universe leaves the realm of &quot;empty space&quot; beyond what our current telescopes can detect. Hense the recent claim of &quot;multiple big bangs&quot; to reconcile the time space differential. And to the theory of evolution betting on chance and lightning to form the first rna structures or preorganisms. To get around this they begin to use the claim that a meteor with some bacteria on it seeded life on earth. .</p>

<p>It is easy to understand why science has become a &quot;cult&quot; when understood from a perspective of how the masses view people with critical information about the movement of the stars. Science didn&#39;t choose to become the new religion. The masses forced them into that role.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how reality can be understood, but needing to simplify it doesn&#39;t seem to make sense... why, just because it&#39;s perceived as easier in our current way of thinking?</p>

<p>How much got misunderstood by simplifying reality to conduct a &quot;scientific experiment&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that science tries to explain the observable with the fewest numbers of rules, the &quot;simplest&quot; way. </p>

<p>But this doesn&#39;t preclude the idea of consciousness and metaphysics etc, it just means we don&#39;t really understand it yet from its simplest principles. The issue in science&#39;s inability to interpret consciousness from the bottom up comes from a few places i think, including our misinterpretation on the shape of planck&#39;s unit and our rudimentary understanding of how the brain processes information. We still don&#39;t really understand how overlapping EMF waves, brain waves, produce a conscient being, much less a deeply spiritual one. </p>

<p>If one begins to consider consciousness as spinning overlapping EMF waves performing quantum computation using geometry, our definition of &quot;where&quot; they could live might change as well, could spinning EMF waves live in the ionospheres of planets? Could the Schumann resonances fulfill this role?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, i&#39;ll give these some reading. I&#39;m aware of the work by Marcello Barbieri, personally there are clearly a few codes w/ in biology which show intelligent order, thereby being able to create far more complexity than the sum of their parts. </p>

<p>A key concept i&#39;ve bumped into consistently is that of the generation of controlled complexity through the use of hierarchically organized combinations of building blocks. A few obvious analogies are the transcription factor system that controls our DNA--&gt;RNA, signalling cascades involving GPCRs, immune signaling w/ TLRs, etc.</p>

<p>There definitely is an intelligent signal <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103513000791">here</a> and its interpretation imo makes directed panspermia something to consider..</p>

<p>Science today, in all fields, is plagued by corruption. Yet, more often than not, attempts to create awareness about scientific fraud — an issue that few journalists have been willing to address — are met with the response, “Well, is it peer-reviewed?”</p>

<p>Although good science should always be reviewed, using this label as a form of credibility can be dangerous, causing people to dismiss new information and research instantaneously if it doesn’t have it, particularly when that information counters long-held beliefs ingrained into human consciousness via mass marketing, education, and more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would argue the biggest issue is the mis-connect of the public&#39;s perception of science and actual science. I find most pop-science articles to be crap, which often miss the point of the original paper or greatly expand the original conclusion beyond what the original paper was getting at. These funds often go to this considered &quot;sexy&quot; for the moment, so if you aren&#39;t doing &quot;sexy&quot; and &quot;inpactful&#39; research, good luck. This issue also comes from the public mis-understanding of science, since answering or exploring a question isn&#39;t seen as being important. To be a modern scientist, you need to be able to respond to the frequent questions of &quot;what&#39;s the point?&quot;, &quot;how will this impact my life?&quot;, among others. </p>

<p>Another thing to consider is that big claims need lots of evidence to support the claim. A scientist will change their mind if you can show enough evidence to back your claim. One issue I have with claims of engines using water (for example), is that the builders of these engines usual are secretive about what happens in their engines, they ask for money first before showing the engine, and don&#39;t back up their claims with evidence. If you want be to believe you, show me things to support it. Otherwise, I don&#39;t care. You can say whatever you want, but if you don&#39;t back it up, I don&#39;t need to believe you. I don&#39;t think an individual will ever be blacklisted for these claims, but they won&#39;t be taken seriously if they continue to fail to support their claims.</p>

<p>A third point to be aware of is that most science is done as a public service. Scientists PAY to publish and do peer reviews for FREE. Also, scientists are humans, so there are some biases and people with big egos in the mix. However, for the most part scientists will try to keep their biases and egos in check.</p>

<p>And from my experience, the more I understand the world scientifically, the more in awe of it I become. I can look into an empty lot and be awed by the life growing and living there. I have seen that in death there is life. I have seen that for every question answered ten more arise. If you think we have discovered everything and no mysteries remain, your mind is already closed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing that I&#39;ve bumped into is that there are things that many Scientists as they&#39;re currently taught are simply unable to consider. If certain fundamental &quot;truths&quot; are questioned the mode of thinking instantly switches to emotional and irrationally skeptical, at that point many scientists will use a skill many have, being able to cherry pick something small to validate what you believe and wash away the rest.</p>

<p>One example I&#39;ve been using to bring this out is a spinning bicycle wheel on a pole, when you spin it up and move it around it feels heavier right? Could this same effect explain isotopes in the way of electrons spinning up instead of adding neutrons? How come E=mc<sup>2</sup> doesn&#39;t have a velocity term? Many many quantum physicists literally become enraged, as if your insulting a religion than trying to figure out what&#39;s going on... it&#39;s insane.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I think this guttural reaction has been leveraged to prevent any huge fundamental leaps in progress, limiting all progress to incremental small steps</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They become enraged because it’s nonsense. First off, in e = mc<sup>2,</sup> c is the velocity term. Second, the way an electron “spins” is fundamentally different from a bicycle wheel, they just chose to use the same word. Third, science is all about building models of the world. When your model makes a prediction that matches measurement, you roll with that model until you observe something that doesn’t match. If you want to replace neutrons with an “up” spin, go ahead, but then you have to consider what new predictions that model would make. If you treat it mathematically the same, then it doesn’t matter which model you use, nothing changes. If on the other hand your “up” spin model changes predictions about how particles behave, then you have to check which of the two models match observation better. The current model which includes neutrons matches observations incredibly well, so there’s no need to change it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, the reason why its a special case is because it considers all of the mass of a particle as a 2D wave, this is only true of 2D things, waves, bosons, photons, 3D matter on the other hand behaves differently, with the analogy of a spinning bicycle wheel becoming relevant. Currently there is no distinction between mass (2D) and matter (3D) which leads to a lot of confusion by interpreting bosons/photons as particles.</p>

<p>It coincidentally turns out that electrons kinda are bicycle wheels spinning w/ in the proton/neutron nuclei, most of their &quot;mass&quot; stored in their momentum which is also their negative charge. We perceive the electron&#39;s presence in the manner akin to throwing charged tennis ball particles and observing where they land, because of that we see them as clouds. Because vast majority of their energy is &quot;stored&quot; in their clouds treating them as 2D waves in our equations actually proves extremely accurate, but its an equilibrium simplification, in reality these are moving, interacting, objects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you mean. Sorry if I came off as a little rude in my above post. I am not a particle physicist so I will not try and debate you, but I am involved in scientific research so I will just say that if you want people to listen to you, you can&#39;t convince anyone by simply suggesting a conceptual change to the model and saying that it makes more sense. You have to identify a problem that your model solves that can&#39;t be solved by the standard model, and then people will pay attention. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>That&#39;s how it was for Einstein and all of the major model changes throughout history. Einstein wasn&#39;t just sitting on his couch thinking &quot;hmm what if time is an illusion and it&#39;s all relative to each individual observer?&quot; No, physicists were conducting experiments to figure out the speed of light, and they came up with the strange result that it always had the same speed, no matter what speed you&#39;re moving at. It&#39;s not relative to anything. It&#39;s like every observer is standing still, even when they&#39;re not, and light was unique in this kind of response. Everyday objects behaved as expected. So there was a crisis in the field and everyone was trying to figure out how their measurements might be wrong, whereas Einstein just said &quot;hmm let&#39;s just stop assuming that time is universal and instead everyone has local time that can be altered by their own speed relative to light.&quot; And THEN when he put that thought down in terms of basic math equations, his equations predicted all of the data that physicists were stumped by, and it predicted some non-intuitive results from experiments that had not been done yet, which were later confirmed.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Sorry for the history lesson if you already know all of that, but my point is if you want to convince people that they&#39;re wrong, you have to show how your model can explain things that are currently inexplicable with existing models. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem! Trust me I&#39;ve experienced much much more rudeness from others in the science field.</p>

<p>My field is specifically genomics, because of that I needed to understand the 3d structure of the genome from the bottom up in order to understand <a href="https://youtu.be/Tn5qgEqWgW8">this</a> kind of thing, I stumbled on the only way to build large structures from the bottom up, a unified theory of physics (not my own!) Due to my expertise it made sense to take a structural, biological take on seeing if a new theory can explain something simply that was very complex before. So I decided to build DNA and the amino acids from the bottom up, in 3D, and the pieces all yielded 3d building blocks that look just like lewis structures but 3D, very hard to ignore.</p>

<p>The thing is we live at an interesting time, where almost everything CAN be explained and has been using complicated theories. What a new theory will do is not necessarily explain all the unknown, but it will explain what other theories can (observables), and then some, using a smaller number of rules.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you have a point here. Scientists work very hard and sacrifice being able to live truly free so they can complete their experiments. When someone suggests their entire effort is based on false premises, it causes cognitive dissonance. An easy way to get around the dissonance is to cherry pick an easy argument.</p>

<p>A good example is people who work with GMO crops. They will laugh in the lab at how “stupid” people are for being afraid of GMO crops, citing that transgenic foods have been proven safe to consume. This is cherry picking and missing the entire point. The point that their work with GMO crops is 95% going to propping up a massively unsustainable food system consisting of monocultures and agrigiants.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s some reading material to go with it. Perhaps 50 percent of the studies out there, at least in certain fields, are severely biased, contain massive errors, have insufficient proof, or are fraudulent. This comes from several whistle blowers and a published study. Perhaps the most well known example of bribery and fraudulent research is with scientists who work for fossil fuel companies, but there are others...especially in medicine.  </p>

<p>That study:</p>

<p>The whistle blowers:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Richard Horton, editor in chief of The Lancet, recently wrote: <a href="http://archive.is/MwiPQ">“Much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness. As one participant put it, “poor methods get results”.</a></p></li>
<li><p>In 2009, Dr. Marcia Angell of the New England Journal of Medicine wrote: <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/jan/15/drug-companies-doctorsa-story-of-corruption/">“It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.”</a></p></li>
<li><p>&quot;I can&#39;t tell you exactly what percentage of the trials are flawed, but I think the problem is far bigger than you imagine, and getting worse...it is so easy to manipulate data, conceal it or fabricate it...there is almost a code of silence not to speak about it.&quot; -<a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/spiegel-interview-with-whistleblower-doctor-peter-wilmshurst-a-1052159.html">Whistleblower Dr. Peter Wilmshurst</a></p></li>

<li><p>&quot;Reproducibility in science is not very sexy.

    <div class="md"><p>There really isn&#39;t an issue in science publishing. Everyone who is trained in science knows how to look at a study and tell at a glance whether it&#39;s useful and valid or publish/perish drivel. </p>

<p>The only problem this creates is when non-experts begin poking around in journals and don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing.</p>

<p>Part of becoming a scientist / getting a higher degree is learning which journals you can trust, which ones you can&#39;t, what makes an article worthwhile or what makes one unreliable, etc.</p>

<p>There is an internal issue within the academy because a lot of these studies are a waste of resources, but beyond that, there is really not an issue. The view that there is a problem is one held exclusively by outsiders that have no training. </p>

<p>This is the problem with vilifying expertise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue I find the most grating, but not necessarily the most problematic, is the deification of the scientific method or scientism more broadly. The scientific method is a wonderfully powerful tool that can guide and frame intellectual enquiry into physical phenomena. The body of knowledge we have built on over the centuries since early philosophers - Bacon, Descartes, Al-Haytham among many others - developed and began employing that mode of inquiry, can be called science. 
What science does not do is answer questions or speak authoritatively on issues - people do that. Using arguments supported by observation of phenomena which is repeatable through experimentation, people posit theories as to the nature of things. This may seem pedantic but I argue it is an important distinction. When we take away human agency from the pursuit of knowledge, the implicit assumption is that this knowledge transcends humans, i.e. that the knowledge claims themselves represent a fundamental and universal truth independent of the person making the claim. Everytime you read some clickbait bullshit saying &quot; &#39;Science&#39; tells us xyz...&quot; or someone tries to defend a position by telling you what &#39;Science&#39; says, they are in (hyperbolic) effect making a conceptual tool employed by humans into some grand, overarching, unquestionable monolith. If they cannot be questioned, the individual tenets of this monolith eventually become dogma which forms an inescapable paradigm. 
This wouldn&#39;t necessarily be an issue if scientific truth was universal. Knowledge claims made in line with the scientific method however are built on inductive reasoning, thus can at most only ever be likely to be true. One of the beauties of the scientific method is when something comes along which shows that a particular knowledge claim is inaccurate, it gets discarded and a new stance is assumed. This happens over and over again til hopefully we&#39;ve gotten as close as possible to something true. But to enquire after the fundamental nature of what is, is no mean feat; paradigm shaking discoveries don&#39;t happen every day. Thus scientists will, assuming that they&#39;re thoughtful and persuing knowledge in good faith, acknowledge that we can&#39;t be certain of x premise but ask &quot;if it were true, what are the follow on effects?&quot;. This process goes on and on and we find out some really neat things. This is of course, a house of cards; take out something from the bottom and the tower crumbles. 
<em>pulls on tinfoil beret</em> There is a question about the fundamental nature of reality that was glossed over early on and needs to be re-examined; is the basic substrata of the universe matter or thought? Physicalism or idealism? The scientific method can only ever address empirical questions. The (useful and necessary) requirements of observability and measurability, restrict the perview of scientific inquiry to physical phenomena. This does not mean that there only exists physical phenomena, simply that ideal or non physical phenomena are outside the realm of questions science can answer. 
I think now is a pertinent time to start asking this question again. From the rise of AI, Mandela effect and simulation theories to a potential awakening of consciousness through psychadelics, many fields of investigation are opening up the possibility that we&#39;ve erroneously assumed a purely physical and mechanical universe, to the exclusion of any potential form of idealism. I am not saying that the universe is ideal. I am saying that when we deify &#39;Science&#39; with a capital &#39;S&#39; and pretend that the only answer to every question must be scientific, we shut off a space for questioning which is counter-productive in the open pursuit of knowledge in good faith. 
I know there are gaps in my argument I need to plug and premises I need to elaborate on but I&#39;ve spent too long on this already. I&#39;m happy if you think I&#39;m a lackwitted fauxlosopher, but attack the points, not the person. Let&#39;s keep it civil, we&#39;re all in the pursuit of knowledge together. Except Steve. Fuck Steve. </p>

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/9fgun1/scientific_publishing_is_a_ripoff_we_fund_the/">https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/9fgun1/scientific_publishing_is_a_ripoff_we_fund_the/</a>  </p>

<p>Then also there&#39;s the fact that loads of scientific studies publish conclusions to non-reproducible experiments, leading people to false conclusions about things, and often these &quot;predetermined&quot; studies are funded by particular corporate interests (for example: studies funded by Monsanto that say glyphosate in roundup is safe and not a cancer risk).<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;For many years I have worked with researchers doing very careful work in [parapsychology], including a year that I spent full-time working on a classified project for the United States government, to see if we could use these abilities for intelligence gathering during the Cold War…. At the end of that project I wrote a report for Congress, stating what I still think is true. The data in support of precognition and possibly other related phenomena are quite strong statistically, and would be widely accepted if it pertained to something more mundane. Yet, most scientists reject the possible reality of these abilities without ever looking at data! And on the other extreme, there are true believers who base their beliefs solely on anecdotes and personal experience. I have asked the debunkers if there is any amount of data that would convince them, and they generally have responded by saying, “probably not.” I ask them what original research they have read, and they mostly admit that they haven’t read any. Now there is a definition of pseudo-science—basing conclusions on belief, rather than data! When I have given talks on this topic to audiences of statisticians, I show lots of data. Then I ask the audience, which would be more convincing to you—lots more data, or one strong personal experience? Almost without fail, the response is one strong personal experience…. I think people are justifiably skeptical, because most people think that these abilities contradict what we know about science. They don’t, but that&#39;s the subject for a different talk!&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s like &quot;priming&quot;, where instead of &quot;I think I can...&quot;, you use terms like, &quot;I know I can...&quot;, you&#39;re basically setting yourself up to succeed, rather than just thinking you can succeed.</p>

<p>This presentation really opened my eyes to how the whole scientific literature system works. Everyone says &quot;don&#39;t listen to one study, look at the whole. Look at meta- analyses.&quot; And while I still usually agree with that, there is a whole other part we need to look at.</p>

<p>Industries flood the literature with an overwhelming number of studies, meta-analyses use the same data in a duplicate manner and don&#39;t realize it, using ghost writers is the norm even if they&#39;re from a pharmaceutical company, unfavorable data just doesn&#39;t make it to publication, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man, I have a full broadside to unleash at the scientific establishment here. Science is fucked. And I know that sounds ignorant but you really have to look deeper into what science as an institution has become. It&#39;s no longer about using evidence to either prove or refute theories based on the validity of the premises like High-Priest Sagan would always preach, it&#39;s about financial influence, the defence of dogmatic ideals, and information gatekeeping.</p>

<p>Currently in modern society, especially on communities like reddit, science is sacrosanct. People will refer to science as the be-all-end-all to an intellectual discussion/argument. Which in theory should be perfectly valid, but that&#39;s not the reality of the situation. The reality is that science has become twisted by interest groups, science journalism has descended into the realms of entertainment journalism and headline grabbing, and the university system long ago became a business. The problem with everyone&#39;s cry to science as an authority to how the cosmos works is that they no longer have a deeper understanding of the concepts they are being told about and just take the conclusions of science on blind faith, assuming that they are being told the truth. The tragically ironic part of this is that this is the exact attitude people have had to religion for centuries, something that would immediately set off the cognitive dissidence alarm in the minds of most &#39;rational&#39; people. But unfortunately that&#39;s what it has become, science has taken on the ideals and attitudes of a religion, while ironically lambasting those very same ideals.</p>

<p>But hey, I did say I had a full broadside of shit to unleash against science here so let&#39;s get to some sources. The first thing I want to strike at is science journals, the new bible for some of you. So many people cry to see proof in a respected peer reviewed journal as concrete evidence that a particular concept or theory is valid, but what if those sources are not legitimate. What if the integrity of the peer reviewed journal system long ago became compromised? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9b936p/the_conspiracy_of_scientific_fraud_70_of/">This post here</a> has about a dozen links to respected sources which state that the peer review system has become corrupt and that false findings, skewed and cherry picked results, and straight up fraud are running rampant in scientific journals. But don&#39;t take my word for it, listen to former editors of respected publications flat out stating that <em>“It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published&quot;</em>. <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960696-1.pdf">See here</a>, <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/jan/15/drug-companies-doctorsa-story-of-corruption/">and here</a>. You want more sources? Check <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/70qvx7/updated_list_of_proven_conspiracies_and_hidden/">this post</a> and go down to the section on science. The whole system is cracked. </p>

<p>And how about the influence of financial interests? Well there are sources <a href="http://naturalsociety.com/monsanto-employee-admits-an-entire-department-exists-to-discredit-scientists/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.mintpressnews.com/news-latest-headlines-facbook-twitter-googlepluse-0-shares-monsanto-faked-data-for-approvals-claims-its-ex-chief/213562/">also here</a> that explain how companies such as Monsanto have entire departments whose job it is to either discredit research or skew studies. I won&#39;t even bother trying to find sources talking about the energy industry warping the perception of climate change and sciences because they are almost too numerous!! </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t end there, how about the very core of what our belief structures as a society are based on? What about sacred theories such as evolution? Which <a href="https://www.collective-evolution.com/2018/08/02/500-renowned-scientists-jointly-share-why-they-reject-darwins-theory-of-evolution/">hundreds of scientists</a> no longer feel is valid in explaining the origins of life on earth. Or how about history, where the established idea of how civilisation has formed is no longer accurate based on geological evidence, studies such as <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/02/180201173251.htm">this</a> which call into question the ancient history of mankind we are all told is true. Not to mention the work by men such as Graham Hancock and Robert Duval. If you want books you can read works such as <em>Worlds in Collision</em> by Immanuel Velikovsky and <em>Cataclysm: Compelling Evidence of a Cosmic Catastrophe in 9500 B.C</em> by D S Allan and J B Delair, which will completely change the way you think about ancient history. All results of a scientific establishment that has become dogmatic and rigid in what they will allow to be changed about established beliefs. </p>

<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg. If you start digging you can find an enormous amount of testimonials from academics about how universities decide what they can and can&#39;t study, how fields like anthropology and astronomy will ruin the careers of those who go against the established belief structure. Fuck, if you really want to see evidence of how the university system is just a business you can look no further then the amount of student debt currently held by not only Americans but young people all around the world. University is a business, not a learning institution. What we believe about the world, the cosmos and ourselves is nothing more than lies and dogmatic beliefs that are no longer relevant or valid. We believe the lies of modern medicine and pharmaceuticals despite the constant stream of whistleblowers trying to scream at everyone not to believe them. We have an ideal about what we are as a species and where we have been as a civilisation that is wrong, flat out wrong. And yet it&#39;s how we live our lives and how we define ourselves as beings. It&#39;s so much bigger then just a few skewed research results, it&#39;s the ideals we base our whole lives and society around. If that well of knowledge has been poisoned then what is the ramifications for all of us if we continue to drink from it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Goddamn exactly! And its pretty crazy as to HOW wrong we&#39;ve gotten it... </p>

<p>In terms of evolution, theres now strong evidence for directed panspermia causing the cambrian explosion (I can gladly point you to the source). So if you consider that, it would mean that theres been something watching for a while, what does that mean for evolution? What if you can tweak evolution by changing what viruses fall on earth?</p>

<p>That&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg, the problem is these ideas used to be able to be considered by the community, now with blind faith anything that fundamentally challenges is met with a veracity and emotional response that causes productive discussion to be impossible. </p>

<p>Many do it with good intentions, to prevent &quot;wrong&quot; thoughts to be accepted by the public. Problem is if you&#39;re unwilling to consider anything different you will forever be stuck with the understanding you have. This isnt only true of biology and evolution, but also physics, psychiatry, etc, many fields find themselves in a place where the leaders are so deeply entrenched in faith they become enraged and unable to listen, it&#39;s really rough trying to go beyond this response.</p>

<p>&quot;
That&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg, the problem is these ideas used to be able to be considered by the community, now with blind faith anything that fundamentally challenges is met with a veracity and emotional response that causes productive discussion to be impossible.

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly man I&#39;m not sure. The best solution I have come up with is to be the change you want to see in the world. One person isn&#39;t going to be able to drastically change anything, but as an individual we can contribute to greater change. I almost feel like having to think we personally must be the ones to stop things is just another ego trap. In terms of what we can do about this issue, just talk about it with people. If you talk about these issues, talk about how what we think of science has become something else it contributes to the greater collective conversation between everyone. The more people that talk about it, the more the issue is brought into the spotlight, the more we can begin to work on rectifying what has happened to science as a discipline. </p>

<p>Try to make a difference at your local level. It&#39;s hard to make a difference for a nation. It&#39;s easy to make a difference for your town.</p>

<p>As for where to start: what do you mean &quot;make a difference?&quot; </p>

<p>If you want to add to the sum of human knowledge, get a PhD in something and become a researcher. Want to help people in the present? Look for people close to you who are suffering, volunteer, and get job training that will make you better at helping them.</p>

<p>Making a difference is easy as long as you accept you&#39;re never going to be a &quot;great man&quot; of history.</p>

<p>Like this is absolutely true - if you look at institutional investors, the same companies own the industrial farm chemical manufacturers, the CPG companies that make and distribute the highly modified and processed foods, and the pharmaceutical companies to treat the chronic illnesses they cause.  </p>

<p>And all of those largest stakeholders are banks.  Which basically leads us back to the major conspiracy which is that the world is run by a hidden group of banking elites who continuously pit different groups of humans against one another to suppress the realization of our true potential as a species and rise up.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s what a lot of people don&#39;t like to admit in this sub. The powerful people, I&#39;m not even gonna start on them- but you see how they put their hand in their coats- that&#39;s a signal that they&#39;re hiding information. That&#39;s their goal. To hide information from the masses in order to keep the system- and those in it- in check. You can perform magic spells on both yourself and others and construct your own reality- but you need to first do it in the mind- &quot;as above so below&quot;.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Everything you see is constructed around the system, and when you start to think about succeeding outside the system and unlocking your potential _outside the system_ - you&#39;ve already taken a step towards that. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The rich and the elite cast spells on our consciousness every day. Through music, media, advertising- its an attack and a tax on our subconscious... in order to make up the group think- to keep that system going, if you follow.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Be aware of magic- understand the _true_ definition of magic. It&#39;s one thing to know who&#39;s doing what- but if we deny the power they have which is not just material- but _spiritual_ as well- we&#39;ve already lost. You don&#39;t bring a knife to a gun fight. Anyway...</p>

<p>What it takes is a journey of one&#39;s self to discover one&#39;s self. It is such a personal journey that it is not the same for each individual. </p>

<p>What I found helpful was to start researching spiritual alchemy...The process of changing one from the inside out. First you must be able to identify who you truly are and what you truly believe. </p>

<p>Ask yourself...Why do I believe the things that I think are so. Is it because my parents told this to me? I was taught them in school? I went to church as a kid and that&#39;s why I believe them? You have to be able to identify the programs that are running in your subconscious that affects the way you look at the world and interpret it. Then you need to be able to destroy those...then and only then, can you start to reshape the way that reality can appear to you.</p>

<p>A word of warning...If your committed to this process, it can be scary, daunting and lead to a total revolution of you as a person. But oh so liberating and freeing once you start to see personal progress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no map to enlightenment.  Religions have been trying to do exactly this for thousands of years, largely without success.</p>

<p><a href="/u/3rdeyenotblind">/u/3rdeyenotblind</a> has some excellent advice.</p>

<p>It is a personal journal, and it is different for each person.  The first thing to do is to investigate the source of your thoughts and beliefs and attempt to determine whether these thoughts are actually yours.  If not, where do they come from?  Do you want to choose to continue to believe them?  If so, why (or why not)?</p>

<p>A meditative practice is an excellent tool for exploring.  It does not matter whether you practice yoga, keep a daily sit spot, practice mindfulness with a mobile phone app, or whatever, so long as you do practice.  Faith is the guide.  Find your faith, and you will find your map.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. So that person is being super vague under the guise of trying to help. He is talking about <em>Magick</em>.</p>

<p>&quot;Spells&quot; aren&#39;t supernatural. The whole thing is basically about finding a way to associate things to keep you dedicated to imposing your will on either yourself or others.</p>

<p>I have a necklace. It was gifted to me by my brother. One day I just decided &quot;this is going to relax me&quot;. Now when I wear it and get flustered, I can feel it under my shirt and it helps me not get pissed. Just the gravity of it. That&#39;s a spell. You could very well just call &quot;spells&quot; &quot;decisions&quot; </p>

<p>Just make associations that relate to you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think one part of the confusion is OP has misspelled &#39;magick&#39;. Speaking of which what is &#39;spelling&#39; and why don&#39;t we call putting letters together to make words, lettering or wording? Also consider we call the most negative or forbidden words &quot;curse&quot; words. So curses and spells.. sounds a bit like Harry Potter but afaik we can&#39;t make things levitate or fly on brooms. </p>

<p>Magick is defined as &quot;the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will&quot;</p>

<p>The reason we speak is so that people <strong>hear</strong> and <strong>respond</strong> to what we are saying. If a parent were to say to their child &quot;Go to the store and buy me some milk.&quot; and 30 minutes later the child is walking back into the house milk in hand; The parent has just effectively used magick. Had they not uttered those spells and in that order they would still be milk-less. </p>

<p>We know that sounds and vibrations have an effect on human physiology. Everyday we listen to music that has an effect on our mood or even cause us to dance. Now imagine how powerful a technology like radio or television could be in using words or spells to manipulate people into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blYD_o9uQn8">&#39;conforming with your will&#39;.</a>  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes... Aleister Crowley&#39;s differentiation. He did understand language as symbols and symbols tied to consciousness- but the little I&#39;ve read from him didn&#39;t address Universal balance. I responded to the skeptical user and addressed that. While I wouldn&#39;t necessarily agree with that example, because we cannot exist without interaction- interaction is not without cause and effect, and the effect doesn&#39;t always change consciousness, (in this case, because obedience would already be a part of the state of consciousness in a relationship between parent and child).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you a teenager? Do you want to know an easy way to &quot;cast a spell&quot; to generate money without having to get a job?</p>

<p>I will tell you the process (or I could even say- the science) of this spell.</p>

<p>First, think about wanting the money to materialize. Imagine the money materializing between your fingertips. What you would spend the money on if you had it. Just think about the money. If you do not do this first step, the money will never materialize.</p>

<p>Now that you&#39;ve found your vibration- we&#39;re going to cast a spell by creating an illusion in order to materialize the money.</p>

<p>Our illusion will not be grand, it won&#39;t take a lot (if any) of physical work, you won&#39;t have to make a blood sacrifice- all you have to do is think of a reason you should get this money. Whether it be a road trip, school trip, party, present for a friend or otherwise- let the reason be anything but the truth (which is that you just want to get your hands on some money; and I will tell you why later).</p>

<p>Now that you have a reason, fortify it with an emotion. If you don&#39;t go on this road trip- will you be sad and disappointed that your friends are going on a life-changing journey without you? Will you be angry if you don&#39;t receive the money because it might impact your academic progress (school trip)?</p>

<p>Once you&#39;re done those three steps- once you&#39;ve aligned with a vibration (money), you&#39;ve laid the groundwork for the illusion (the lie) and you&#39;ve charged it with an energy (emotion), now it is time to cast the spell.</p>

<p>All three points must be in a balance of power. The greater amount of money you seek, the greater the groundwork for the illusion must be, and the greater the energy associated with the spell must be.</p>

<p>Go to your parents and ask them for money, give your reason, and then utilize your body (eyes, voice, behavior) to display emotion to charge your reason. Remember, everything must be in balance; You cannot make a fuss over five dollars, as you cannot ask for five-thousand haphazardly. Once you&#39;ve finished asking them- leave all the extra work to the Universe.</p>

<p>If your spell worked, your parents should be back with some money. If your spell failed, you should reexamine your spell, or find ways to fortify your illusion in order to materialize the money.</p>

<p>To sum this up- through the lie (deceit through symbols spoken), you have created an illusion in the material world (the world of senses), and have began to manipulate reality through vibrations.</p>

<p>The breakdown of the casting of the spell to materialization.</p>

<p>Something manifesting in your consciousness -&gt; Something said by Spoken Language -&gt; Something fortified by Energy -&gt; Something heard by Your Parents&#39; ears -&gt; Something manifesting in their consciousness -&gt; Something materializing in reality</p>

<p>If any step is not thought out or fails in execution, the spell&#39;s success rate drops significantly. The illusion <em>must</em> carry enough power to pass through each step.</p>

<p>Our Universe is the truth, the basis of &quot;reality,&quot; of order and balance, and your lie is not; because there are always agents of truth (or &quot;karma&quot;) seeking to maintain balance and working against your illusion, you will need to utilize other agents (such as emotion- &quot;energy in motion,&quot; i.e. desperation, disappointment, sadness, anger) to fortify the power of your lie/spell.</p>

<p>If you are very in-tune with your body and connected to your consciousness, you will be able to command your body to behave in a way as if you were telling the truth to add power to the spell. This is why Western society associates &quot;pathological liars&quot; as socially dangerous.</p>

<p>However, after all this I must say, if You tell the truth from the beginning- You will not have upset the balance of nature. When the pendulum swings one way- it also swings the other. When we call upon forces to manifest illusions- we&#39;re disrupting reality, which rests on Universal Balance (which is a whole other discussion for another day).</p>

<p>As soon as you tell a lie and upset the balance- that is the second the Universe starts going in motion to work against it- the more grandeur the lie, the more grand the consequence when the truth becomes realized (&quot;the bigger you are, the harder you fall&quot;).</p>

<p>If you are wondering the reason why I call lies &quot;illusions&quot;- is because a lie by spoken word is exactly that. An illusion is not materializing &quot;something out of nothing,&quot; you are materializing something by utilizing <em>consciousness.</em> Our consciousness is connected to our senses. It only takes a split second to deceive someone&#39;s eyes. Whether it be by a puff of smoke, or sleight of hand- that split-second of energy and motion, in which the eyes cannot truly see or the ears cannot truly hear- that is the window of opportunity to create new consciousness.</p>

<p>You create images of reality in someone else&#39;s consciousness to materialize something you couldn&#39;t create by yourself. Therefore when I use science to &quot;bend water,&quot; or &quot;float while sitting,&quot; I&#39;m materializing the power of my &#39;divinity&#39; or &#39;supernatural ability&#39; not just in my consciousness- but in <em>our</em> consciousness. However, like I said, though chaos energy exists and is everywhere, the universe favors balance.</p>

<p>Magic aligned with the truth- the force/balance/nature of the Universe, will always prevail and be more powerful over magic manifested by that chaos which is against the truth, against balance and against nature. This is constant, and it is the way of our universe- it cannot be denied.</p>

<p>In our modern age- illusions are powerful ways to cast spells and is the <em>most common</em> practice of magic today, in my opinion. One of which is lying, which is heavily accepted in the West, and is even circumstantially dubbed &quot;White Lies,&quot; (even though it is still chaos energy). In other places of the world, lying is recognized as a form of chaos energy, or evil, and is not tolerated <em>at all.</em></p>

<p>Can you think of ways (other than lying) that illusion spells are cast in modern Western society?</p>

<p>Anyway. I don&#39;t know why I wrote something this long. Maybe I will create a new thread and leave it there.</p>

<p>God bless you and have a good day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I use to think this was crazy.  Recently I have become interested in Plato and his political theories.  I think these theories have formed the foundation for western political science. </p>

<p>In one of Plato&#39;s books, called The Republic, he suggests that the reproduction of the cities population be controlled by the ruling elite.  Since the population would rebel against such control, Plato suggests using a lottery where two people would be chosen at &quot;random&quot; to have sex.  Of course the rulers would making the choices.</p>

<p>The city he is describing is not a republic.  The people think its a republic, but it is really an oligarchy.</p>

<p>I have heard one pubic political science guy say that Plato was just kidding about most of the stuff in The Republic.  That is hard to believe.  I think only the elite read at the time, so there was no need to hide his writings.</p>

<p>I think with the increase in communication the internet has brought, and the increased access to education, people are starting to see that modern day republics are oligarchies also.</p>

<p>Concepts of civil rights and equality hadn&#39;t been invented yet. There were slaves and indentured servants and starving people in Plato&#39;s day.

    <div class="md"><p>That is stupid wishful thinking.</p>

<p>Granted, it is entirely possible we are in a simulation, <em>but</em> that means we are also <em>part</em> of the simulation... a successful attempt at developing emergent artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>But that isn’t any different than religion is it?  The exact same ancient thought with modernized names for things.  Still means that <em>a creator</em> made us and our world for a purpose; what is the real difference between “God created the world in his image” and “a programmer created a simulated reality to generate true artificial intelligence that passed the Turing test”?</p>

<p>The reason <em>your take</em> on it is stupid is because rather than accept that our world being a simulation means nothing of consequence, you craft some Hollywood cliche of an idea that we are “real” but our world is not which implies that we could escape it.  That is just a false hope of wishful thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>as someone who works as a trader at arguably the most powerful bank, i can assure you that institutional investors/banks almost never hold a controlling stake in the companies you mentioned, and that their objective is simply to create value for shareholders and clients. our decisions are influenced entirely by numbers. it’s not like metlife is in fucking cahoots with bayers monsanto making sure enough people are getting sick so their other client pfizer can continue making profitable drugs. to thoroughly believe this is the case is ignorant and a complete disregard for how financial companies operate</p>

<p>it’s true that there are inherent conflicts of interest in pharmaceutical companies, but there is nothing stopping a small competitor company from creating a cure to cancer (if one existed), for example, and releasing it to the public.</p>

<p>sure powerful bankers exist, but they’re almost always in direct competition with one another and most of their time (at work and out of it) is allocated toward creating financial value for themselves and investors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no i don’t believe traders are personally responsible for the financial crisis lol, and to hold that belief is misinformed. there are a lot of market forces that resulted in the crisis. be sure though- traders being over-exposed to real estate risk is one of them</p>

<p>i believe the organizations that incorrectly rated clos and cmbs are at fault. it’s not illegal to sell a financial product and there’s always risk involved. the rating of the products is a barometer for risk, so when they are not fitting, it’s easy for banks to become over exposed. mainly i blame irresponsible borrowers and lenders though (low rates). they’re sort of the root cause of the crisis.</p>

<p>and as much as you guys would like to believe that the bailouts were simply because banks are buddy-buddy with the government, it was more to prevent total financial collapse. after all, banks (were, and still are) the backbone of any capitalist regime</p>

<p>you’re right in that fed controls money supply, but in reality they just infrequently raise or lower rates a small fraction of a percent (in response to current market conditions) in efforts to control growth. it’s quite an overstatement to say they control “all markets” lol. i’m not being willfully ignorant, i’m being realistic and pragmatic. in reality it’s you being willfully ignorant, succumbing to confirmation biases based on false pretense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have something to add to this. </p>

<p>Some of you may know me from my &quot; what the hell happened in x &quot; posts, which I will be updating soon enough.</p>

<p>You may know that I do not find the Mainstream Scientific Community to be of much merit, while I do value their contributions to society. I especially find the Mainstream historical, biological and archaeological communities to be extraordinarily spiteful.</p>

<p>I have gathered some examples of discoveries which could have overturned what are considered accepted facts, that were bitterly scorned, with their discoverers spurned by the global scientific elite. </p>

<p>-In the early 1950s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_E._Lee">Thomas E. Lee</a> of the National Museum of Canada found advanced stone tools in glacial deposits at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheguiandah">Sheguiandah</a>, on Manitoulin Island in northern Lake Huron. Geologist <a href="http://www.geosociety.org/documents/gsa/memorials/v13/Sanford-JT.pdf">John Sanford of Wayne State University</a> argued that the oldest Sheguiandah tools were <a href="https://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/gpq/1986-v40-n3-gpq1924/032652ar.pdf">at least 65,000 years old and might be as much as 125,000 years old</a>. For those adhering to standard views on North American prehistory, such ages were unacceptable. Humans supposedly first entered North America from Siberia about 12,000 years ago. Thomas E. Lee <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_E._Lee#Career">complained</a>: &quot;The site&#39;s discoverer [Lee] was hounded from his Civil Service position into prolonged unemployment; publication outlets were cut off; the evidence was misrepresented by several prominent authors . . .; the tons of artifacts vanished into storage bins of the National Museum of Canada; for refusing to fire the discoverer, the Director of the National Museum, who had proposed having a monograph on the site published, was himself fired and driven into exile; official positions of prestige and power were exercised in an effort to gain control over just six Sheguiandah specimens that had not gone under cover; and the site has been turned into a tourist resort. . . . Sheguiandah would have forced embarrassing admissions that the Brahmins did not know everything. It would have forced the rewriting of almost every book in the business. It had to be killed. It was killed.” </p>

<p>-In 1880, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Whitney">J. D. Whitney, the state geologist of California</a> published a lengthy review of advanced stone tools found in California gold mines. The implements, including spear points and stone mortars and pestles, were found deep in mine shafts, underneath thick, undisturbed layers of lava, in formations ranging from 9 million to over 55 million years old. W. H. Holmes of the Smithsonian Institution, one of the most vocal critics of California finds, <a href="http://www.unmyst3.com/2011/06/neolithic-tools-from-california-gold.html">wrote: &quot;Perhaps if Professor Whitney had fully appreciated the story of human evolution as it is understood today, he would have hesitated to announce the conclusions formulated [that humans existed in very ancient times in North America], notwithstanding the imposing array of testimony with which he was confronted.&quot; In other words, if the facts do not agree with the favored theory, then such facts, even an imposing array of them, must be discarded.</a></p>

<p>The sad thing is, Whitney was involved in his own cover ups, imploring that the Yosemite Valley had shrunk as opposed to being carved out by glaciers, and was posting redacted studied long afyer it was proven</p>

<p>-Anton Mifsud, a noted archeologist who I have written about before, covers the Malta cover up, <a href="https://grahamhancock.com/mifsuda2/">including the deliberat destruction of wall carvings, wall paintings, skulls and fossils and acientific reports brilliantly here</a></p>

<p>-Armand de Quatrefages, a member of the French Academy of Sciences and a professor at the Museum of Natural History in Paris, wrote in his book Hommes Fossiles et Hommes Sauvages (1884): &quot;The objections made to the existence of humans in the Pliocene and Miocene periods seem to habitually be more related to theoretical considerations than to direct observation.” He wrote this in relation to the findings of another scientist, a J. Desnoyers at St.Prest, which had been dismissed despie ardent evidence.</p>

<p>-Another recent example of challenging discoveries contradictive to the the views of the MSSC by dismissing them as false or fabrication, similar in fashion to that of the St. Prest discovery is the events surrounding the <a href="https://www.anzaborregopaleo.org/cutmarks-on-bone.html">bone fragments discovered by George Miller, curator of the Imperial Valley College Museum in El Centro, California</a>. Miller, who died in 1989, reported that six mammoth bones excavated from the Anza-Borrego Desert bear scratches of the kind produced by stone tools. Uranium isotope dating carried out by the U.S. Geological Survey indicated that the bones are at least 300,000 years old, and paleo-magnetic dating and volcanic ash samples indicated an age of some 750,000 years. One established scholar said that Miller&#39;s claim is &quot;as reasonable as the Loch Ness Monster or a living mammoth in Siberia,&quot; while Miller countered that &quot;these people don&#39;t want to see man here because their careers would go down the drain.” </p>

<p>-A good example of a controversial American early stone-tool industry reminiscent of the European eoliths is the one discovered by <a href="https://www.scahome.org/publications/proceedings/Proceedings.09Carter.pdf">George Carter in the 1950s at the Texas Street excavation in San Diego.</a> At this site, Carter claimed to have found hearths and crude stone tools at levels corresponding to the last interglacial period, some 80,000-90,000 years ago. Critics scoffed at these claims, referring to Carter&#39;s alleged tools as products of nature, or &quot;cartifacts,&quot; and Carter was later publicly defamed in a Harvard course on &quot;Fantastic Archeology.&quot; However, Carter gave clear criteria for distinguishing between his tools and naturally broken rocks, and lithic experts such as <a href="https://www.scahome.org/publications/proceedings/Proceedings.09Carter.pdf">John Witthoft</a> have endorsed his claims. In 1973, Carter conducted more extensive excavations at Texas Street and invited numerous archeologists to come and view the site firsthand. Almost none responded. Carter stated: &quot;San Diego State University adamantly refused to look at work in its own backyard.&quot; In 1960, an editor of Science, the journal of the American Academy for the Advancement of Science, asked Carter to submit an article about early humans in America. Carter did so, but when the editor sent the article out to two scholars for review, they rejected it. Upon being informed of this by the editor, Carter replied in a letter, dated February 2, 1960: &quot;I must assume now that you had no idea of the intensity of feeling that reigns in the field. It is nearly hopeless to try to convey some idea of the status of the field of Early Man in America at the moment. But just for fun: I have a correspondent whose name I cannot use, for though he thinks that I am right, he could lose his job for saying so. I have another anonymous correspondent who as a graduate student found evidence that would tend to prove me right. He and his fellow student buried the evidence. They were certain that to bring it in would cost them their chance for their Ph.D.s. At a meeting, a young professional approached me to say, &#39;I hope you really pour it on them. I would say it if I dared, but it would cost me my job.&#39; At another meeting, a young man sidled up to say, &#39;In dig x they found core tools like yours at the bottom but just didn&#39;t publish them.&#39;&quot; The inhibiting effect of negative propaganda on the evaluation of Carter&#39;s discoveries is described by archeologist Brian Reeves, who wrote with his coauthors in 1986: &quot;Were actual artifacts uncovered at Texas Street, and is the site really Last Interglacial in age? . . . Because of the weight of critical &#39;evidence&#39; presented by established archaeologists, the senior author [Reeves], like most other archaeologists, accepted the position of the skeptics uncritically, dismissing the sites and the objects as natural phenomena.&quot; But when he took the trouble to look at the evidence himself, Reeves changed his mind. He concluded that the objects were clearly tools of human manufacture and that the Texas Street site was as old as Carter had claimed.</p>

<p>The point I wish to make here is hpw Carter was treated.
Later dating proved him wrong and his critics somewhat right in that they were both off, its was older than what was accepted, but younger than what was claimed. </p>

<p>-Early in his career, Louis Leakey, who later became famous for his discoveries at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olduvai_Gorge">Olduvai Gorge in Africa</a>,  began to have radical ideas about the antiquity of humans in America. At that time, scientists thought the entry date for the Siberian hunters was no greater than 5,000 years ago. <a href="https://plus.google.com/+ChrisReeveOnlineScientificDiscourseIsBroken/posts/JtRaDex3d5V">Leakey recalled</a> &quot;Back in 1929-1930 when I was teaching students at the University of Cambridge . . . I began to tell my students that man must have been in the New World at least 15,000 years. I shall never forget when Ales Hrdlicka, that great man from the Smithsonian Institution, happened to be at Cambridge, and he was told by my professor (I was only a student supervisor) that Dr. Leakey was telling students that man must have been in America 15,000 or more years ago. He burst into my rooms—he didn&#39;t even wait to shake hands.&quot; Hrdlicka said, &quot;Leakey, what&#39;s this I hear? Are you preaching heresy?&quot; &quot;No, Sir!&quot; said Leakey. Hrdlicka replied, &quot;You are! You are telling students that man was in America 15,000 years ago. What evidence have you?&quot; Leakey answered, &quot;No positive evidence. Purely circumstantial evidence. But wa ith a man from Alaska to Cape Horn, with many different languages and at least two civilizations, it is not possible that he was present only the few thousands of years that you at present allow.&quot; Leakey continued to harbor unorthodox views on this matter, and in 1964 he made an effort to collect some definite evidence at the Calico site in the Mojave Desert of California. This site is situated near the shore of now-vanished Pleistocene Lake Manix. Over a period of eighteen years of excavation under the direction of Ruth D. Simpson, 11,400 eolith-like artifacts were recovered from a number of levels. The oldest artifactbearing level has been given an age of 200,000 years by the uranium series method. However, as happened with Texas Street, mainstream archeologists rejected the artifacts discovered at Calico as products of nature, and the Calico site is passed over in silence in popular accounts of archeology. Leakey&#39;s biographer Sonia Cole said, &quot;For many colleagues who felt admiration and affection for Louis and his family, the Calico years were an embarrassment and a sadness.&quot; Yet the artifacts of Calico also have their defenders, who give elaborate arguments showing that they were human artifacts, not geofacts resulting from natural processes. Phillip Tobias, the well-known associate of Raymond Dart, discoverer of Australopithecus, declared in 1979: &quot;When Dr. Leakey first showed me a small collection of pieces from Calico . . . I was at once convinced that some, though not all, of the small samples showed unequivocal signs of human authorship.&quot; Ruth D. Simpson stated in 1986: &quot;It would be difficult for nature to produce many specimens resembling man-made unifacial tools, with completely unidirectional edge retouch done in a uniform, directed manner. The Calico site has yielded many completely unifacial stone tools with uniform edge retouch. These include end scrapers, side scrapers, and gravers.&quot; Flake tools with unifacial, unidirectional chipping, like those found at Calico, are typical of the European eoliths. Examples are also found among the Oldowan industries of East Africa. Among the best tools that turned up at Calico was an excellent beaked graver. Bola stones have also been reported. In general, however, the Calico discoveries have met with silence, ridicule, and opposition in the ranks of mainstream paleoanthropology. Ruth Simpson nevertheless stated: &quot;The database for very early man in the New World is growing rapidly, and can no longer simply be ignored, because it does not fit current models of prehistory in the New World. . . . there is a need for flexibility in thinking to assure unbiased peer reviews.” Support for the authenticity of the Calico tools has come from a find in Brazil. In 1982, Maria Beltrao found a series of caves with wall paintings in the state of Bahia. In 1985, a trench was cut in the Toca da Esperansa (Cave of Hope), and excavations in 1986 and 1987 yielded crude stone tools associated with Pleistocene mammals. When the bones were tested by the uranium series method, ages in excess of 200,000 years were obtained. The maximum age was 295,000 years. The discovery was reported to the scientific world by Henry de Lumley, a famous French archeologist. The tools were fashioned from quartz pebbles and were somewhat like those from Olduvai Gorge. The nearest source of quartz pebbles is about 10 kilometers from the cave site. De Lumley and his coworkers said in their report: &quot;The evidence seems to indicate that Early Man entered into the American continent much before previously thought.&quot; They went on to say: &quot;In light of the discoveries at the Toca da Esperansa, it is much easier to interpret the lithic industry of the Calico site, in the Mojave Desert, near Yermo, San Bernardino County, California, which is dated at between 150,000 and 200,000 years.&quot; According to de Lumley and his associates, humans and human ancestors entered the Americas from northern Asia several times during the Pleistocene. The early migrants, who manufactured the tools in the Brazilian cave, were, they said, Homo erectus. While this view is in harmony with the consensus on human evolution, there is no reason why the tools in the Toca da Esperansa could not have been made by anatomically-modern humans. As we have several times mentioned, such tools are still being manufactured by humans in various parts of the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>“I want to pause here and talk about this notion of consensus, and the rise of what has been called consensus science. I regard consensus science as an extremely pernicious development that ought to be stopped cold in its tracks. Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled. Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other, reach for your wallet, because you&#39;re being had.<br/>
Let&#39;s be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus.<br/>
There is no such thing as consensus science. If it&#39;s consensus, it isn&#39;t science. If it&#39;s science, it isn&#39;t consensus. Period.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem that I have with science in the western world is that &quot;science&quot; is no longer about classification of knowledge and the activity of of breaking things down to understand them. Science has become the subjugation of truth and reality- and that is just... it really has taken a toll on people&#39;s minds I think, in the Western world.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>A lot of people equate science to truth. They think that science is about finding truth but it&#39;s not. You learn about the science <em>of</em> something.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I think that science has pushed magics and things not easily explained or understood (including- but not limited to- concepts of a God, fixed or multiple realities, etc.) into something that seems &quot;silly&quot; or &quot;archaic,&quot; and because of that I find myself shocked at the Western world and how everyone in it gets played like a fool and then wonders why.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Those&quot;elites&quot; or &quot;powerful people&quot; or the &quot;1%&quot; or whoever else- <strong>they believe in magic and practice it. They believe in the occult and they regularly practice it.</strong> Why? You think because it&#39;s a fun activity? Because they&#39;re just &quot;oh so evil&quot; so they need to reflect images of that? No. Because the shit is real. And they&#39;re using magicks and occult practices on you people. Lemme just drop something here so you guys understand. &quot;Magic&quot;- from where I&#39;m from- is seen as- the manipulation of reality, and people back in the day- back in our homeland- practiced witchcraft heavily. I have family who practiced witchcraft (Obeah). So when you start to manipulate reality- which we know is a construct of our minds (conscious and subconscious)- is when you start to perform magic. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Telling a lie is the most normal thing here in the West, meanwhile- you would be exposed and branded elsewhere for something like that. You even have people out here talking about &quot;white lies.&quot; And no one questions why? Nobody asks why there&#39;s &quot;white lies&quot; and &quot;black/dark magic&quot;? That they needed to differentiate to begin with??</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Imagine a world where people told the truth and lying was almost as bad as murder, imagine how straightfoward and honest people would be and how much trouble that would save you. Places like that exist. I&#39;ve lived in places like that. My home country is like that.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Science is great. But to me science is research- science is the constructions of a thing. You learn about the science of biology. The science of chemistry. The science of psychology. You don&#39;t learn the science of truth- because the truth is the truth- period. Let me end this with: &quot;magic is magic until its science&quot; is false. It&#39;s only through understanding the science of something that you can then perform magic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>especially so when certain &quot;popularizers&quot; like neil degrasse tyson and his ilk decide to speak ex cathedra on matters they simply cannot have any information about. i like science, but science cannot say anything about what might be beyond death or operating outside the confines of our perceptible universe. i understand that believing in other things is not scientific, i wish the scientists would stick to what they know and can prove.</p>

<p>the &quot;cult&quot; of science is especially noticeable when one is confronted by someone educated by these popularizers. i was recently told about how information flows along the surface of a blackhole or something by a guy who read something by stephen hawking. </p>

<p>How do you prove the earth is flat? How come no one has fallen off the earth or hit big walls of ice? Just curious if you can send me some info that would be awesome.</p>

<p>I can never get real answers and the dudes are usually crazy af. Educate me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess the thought process is that the earth is flat and motionless by all accounts of my personal experience and I have come to find the ball earth evidence insufficient for my personal belief. Part of the mind fuck is that you have to prove the earth is flat based on the axiom the earth is a ball.</p>

<p>Look up the history of Jesuit spread of ball earth theory in the 17th century, China thought the earth was flat until 1600s when a Jesuit priest gained favor in the Imperial court. They must be crazy af in China yo. History of Antarctica, like how it wasn&#39;t discovered until 1820 and the Operations there with Admiral Byrd and his infamous TV interview. Ancient cultures and the belief in flat earth and a firmament, extra credit for Werhner von Braun&#39;s tombstone bible verse. See Operation Domino, Fishbowl, Starfish. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a good chunk of stuff to start with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m aware this isn&#39;t all of you (just a seeming majority), but can you please stop conflating evolution, evolution by natural selection, abiogenesis, and possibly the big bang theory under the umbrella term of &quot;evolution&quot;?</p>

<p>If you really want a science conspiracy, maybe start with figuring out why a substantial portion of the population doesn&#39;t understand the difference between those terms; it&#39;s the biggest example of active disinformation in science in my opinion. It&#39;s easy to dismiss &quot;evolution&quot; when it&#39;s presented as, &quot;basically everything is random and came out of an explosion and also god doesn&#39;t exist&quot;, but evolution is the simple fact that species change over time (observably, this isn&#39;t disputable unless you are an absolute moron). It isn&#39;t anything else. </p>

<p>Natural selection is the concept that evolution can be directed by natural forces; if a change is detrimental to the reproduction of an organism, it tends to get passed on less than ones that are beneficial, thus over successive generations the beneficial traits tend to stick around while the detrimental ones tend to get weeded out. It isn&#39;t anything relating to abiogenesis, or the big bang, or even any specific claim about heritage. This is literally how we breed animals and plants, so it shouldn&#39;t be controversial either. </p>

<p>If you want to dispute abiogenesis, or say that a specific claim about heritage is false, or even go for the absolute bullshit that is intelligent design (an idea that assumes the conclusion and sets out to find any way of supporting it that isn&#39;t immediately disprovable, only to fail literally every time), go right ahead, but please for the love of all that is good stop talking about the &quot;myth of evolution&quot;; each time you do, you are simply proving that humans are, in fact, dumb apes, and by virtue of failing to correctly use even the most basic terms of something you&#39;re making a claim to have insight on beyond that of the general population, you are ensuring that anyone with even a cursory understanding of the topic dismisses any and all claims you make immediately. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You start out with very insightful knowledge:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In science we believe everything has been proven. That is a huge misconception. They can&#39;t prove anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But you&#39;re incorrect to expect anything more than this. Turns out, the only things you can &quot;prove&quot; in the technical sense are to be found in &quot;closed, logical systems&quot; like math and formal logic. Those systems deal with deductive logic: if truth goes into valid arguments, you can guarantee truth as a product.</p>

<p>Science, forensics, fraud investigations, applied maths, all the other forms of &quot;figuring things out&quot; or &quot;verifying theories&quot; that exist deal in <em>inductive</em> logic.</p>

<p>Inductive logic cannot guarantee the truth of the product <strong>even if the inputs are true.</strong> That&#39;s why science can&#39;t &quot;prove&quot; anything, however, it can <em>demonstrate</em> theories. And it&#39;s the system of figuring things out that we depend upon the most.</p>

<p>For example, if you mix vinegar and baking soda 10,000 times, and each time it does the same thing, you still cannot guarantee the reaction on the 10,001st time. But science can answer one question with certainty: is this theory false? The answers come in 3 varieties: </p>

<ul>
<li>1. Yes</li>
<li>2. Not yet</li>
<li>3. The theory is meaningless</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s all we can get from science.</p>

<p>To sum up, most people don&#39;t understand a goddamned thing about science or evidence, yet they&#39;re ready to take a shit on all the products of scientific investigation regardless of methods employed to reach various conclusions. In order to tell if results are being manipulated, one must actually read the study and look for ways for the data to get flubbed. </p>

<p>I&#39;d bet my testicles not a single &quot;science denier&quot; has the patience or wherewithall to do that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m always amazed by the level of anti-intellectual resistance and hysteria that my videos receive on YouTube, largely from people that share this perspective of science and automatically distrust and resent anyone who possess scientific knowledge and skill.  At this point I don&#39;t really care about educating them, I just enjoy owning them in debates and making them look like fools.  The hysteria over this month&#39;s double SDO eclipse (due to retrograde motion caused by SDO&#39;s orbit) and the resistance many had to its explanation has illuminated a great way forward for me.  I&#39;ve set up a YouTube bot that will automatically predict all future SDO eclipses.  </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJAoKCBmXcRY406OIBSo_Jg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJAoKCBmXcRY406OIBSo_Jg</a></p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Now of course this bot does not get many subscribers or views, but that&#39;s fine with me.  When the next eclipse happens that causes the anti-intellectuals to start blaming Nibiru, Planet X, Hercolubus, or whatever else, I&#39;ll be there and ready with a video predicting it that has an upload date that pre-dates the event.  I will then enjoy the fights and argumentative beat downs that occur as we discuss how I&#39;m a shill, paid by NASA, a secret government agent, a liar, etc.  And so the myth of &quot;scientism&quot; will continue and I will contribute to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well science is still science but, yeah, the trusted institutions of mainstream science &amp; academia are being infiltrated/hijacked one after another, and some were never legitimate to begin with.<br/>
It has become a new religion in which these institutions are the new priests.<br/>
They say they&#39;re doing legit science and that their work is being tested/peer-reviewed in an honest meaningful manner and the followers - the mainstream science/academia fanboys - just assume they&#39;re telling the truth.<br/>
Essentially <em>none</em> of the followers will ever conduct research &amp; experiments of their own to determine if they&#39;re being told the truth. And, even if they were to do so, and were to discover that they were being deceived, there are solid systems in place for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GujLcfdovE8">squelching and discrediting them</a>.<br/>
It&#39;s worth pointing out that this model is being increasingly used in the world of open source software as well.<br/>
The software is being widely trusted because it is open source and its code can be checked by anyone. Unfortunately, virtually nobody who uses the software ever checks the code, or even has the ability to effectively do so. This is allowing the intelligence community to sneak very carefully crafted backdoors into open source software.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The “THEORY” that everything in the Universe will cease to exist is so stupendously inaccurate is highlights the ignorance that has befallen humanity!</p>

<p>The Stars are not giant balls of gas, the Universe will not shrivel and wither into nothing, black holes are not single points of infinity that sit there doing nothing but leaking Hawking Radiation, withering into nothingness…</p>

<p>Science, mainstream academic science is so fundamentally flawed it is literally stupefying!</p>

<p>If you were to ask yourself, why is modern, “public domain” science so inaccurate and flawed, the true answer would actually be way beyond your ability to fathom, accept or even contemplate, so I will not tell you “why” science in mainstream academia is distorted</p>

<p>What I will say, is that mainstream public domain science is being deliberately altered and aberrated for the purpose of suppressing knowledge and advancement in many fields, especially the fields of space travel.</p>

<p>The “Law” that “Energy can neither be created or destroyed” is not true. In-fact, all the laws of physics are completely wrong - period!</p>

<p>As an example, to say a body in motion will remain in motion until acted upon by an external force, this is wrong! I can not breakdown the dynamics of the Universe without literally writing a book, but I will tell you very simply that; If there is something preventing Matter/Energy from moving faster than the speed of light, then that “something” is going to have an effect on all Matter/Energy in the Universe!</p>

<p>To keep things simple, say you are in the Void - you are between the Galaxies. Okay, you are there with a bow and arrow - you pull back the string and shoot your arrow in the direction of the nearest Galaxy, it is 5 million light years away, and there is NOTHING between you and that Galaxy. - Will your Arrow continue moving at the same speed and direction towards the Galaxy? Mainstream science will say it will. even if it is on its journey for billions of years, it will continue on its path until acted upon by a force… This is FALSIFIED! If there is “something” that prevents matter or energy from moving faster than light, then that something will have an effect on all matter in the Universe and this “something” will have an effect on the arrow. It will travel at the same speed for a very very very very very very long time, but eventually it will start to slow down. The Higgs Field (also known as the “Dark Energy Field,” the very field that gives Matter its Mass will slow the arrow down</p>

<p>Energy cannot be created or destroyed is also inaccurate.</p>

<p>I will keep it VERY simple and tell you that there are ways to use Time Manipulation and generate an excess of energy - NEW ENERGY can be created, and I will tell you that Black Holes are creating NEW ENERGY all the time.</p>

<p>The Universe will not shrivel into nothingness. Stars are not giant balls of gas, Black Holes aren’t simply points of infinity sitting in space doing nothing but eating Galaxies! Black Holes, especially Supermassive Black Holes GROW Galaxies!</p>

<p>Black Holes are actually Crystal Core Quantum Computers and they literally create Universes inside themselves and if the Universe inside the Black Hole is growing, the Black Hole can actually generate an excess of energy and spit that excess energy up and grow a Galaxy around itself!</p>

<p>HI GUYS, ITS THE MORGELLONS GUY. </p>

<p>(no I do not give people morgellons, don&#39;t hurt me)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/8kegem/history_of_morgellons_disease_from_delusion_to/?st=jmrmcib2&amp;amp;sh=57ff7146">https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/8kegem/history_of_morgellons_disease_from_delusion_to/?st=jmrmcib2&amp;amp;sh=57ff7146</a></p>

<p>This was removed for no real reason and I classified it under medicine or biology, I forget.</p>

<p><strong>If your lazy, TL;DR:</strong></p>

<p>Submission statement (I will be using the conclusion of the article):</p>

<p>&quot;Conclusion</p>

<p>&quot;The history of MD has taught us that scientific evidence must be carefully considered before a disease is written off as a purely psychiatric disorder. Delusional disorder is a diagnosis of exclusion that requires clinical judgment, and all underlying causes for delusional symptoms need to be ruled out before jumping to erroneous conclusions. Medical practitioners continue to consider MD a delusional disorder, although studies have shown that MD is strongly associated with spirochetal infection. According to the best-available scientific evidence, MD should be considered a dermopathy associated with tick-borne disease. Further study of the genetics, pathogenesis, and treatment of MD is warranted.&quot;</p>

<p>Morgellons disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi present within the epidermis, Borrelia burgdorferi, the same bacteria that causes Lyme disease, is the culprit. The presence of the borrelia spirochetes causes keratinocytes, fibroblasts and melanocytes to activate causing filaments of keratin and collagen with pigmentation occurring to form on a microscopic level.</p>

<p><strong>BEFORE I GO ANY FURTHER</strong> </p>

<p>I swear someone edited and changed my comment to sound grammatically and verbally incorrect, go read what I copied and pasted (and had to edit?) on the original thread, it reads like someone edited it to sound... idk?</p>

<p><strong>Going on</strong></p>

<p>Where did my hunt begin? 2016 at the start of the new year.</p>

<p>Why did you hunt? Came across a youtube video of some jacknugget with hair taped to a lamp shade with the light on with the hair moving saying how the hairs are alive/etc, was kind of fucked up but I had remembered it back in the day being the &quot;delusional/bug disorder&quot;, and from 2013-2016 my understanding of biochem, etc just got better (self taught, no certificates or degrees, I suck) at reading peer reviewed articles and determining garbage method/something, etc etc. Something about that video, at that time sparked a sudden desire to research it, and then I came across something sexy in my opinion, it turned me on sexually and mentally. </p>

<p>THE ORIGINAL STUDY: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257881/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257881/</a></p>

<p>2011 folks, its one of the sexiest peer reviewed studies I have ever layed eyes on, it legit gave me a hard one. </p>

<p>&quot;In BDD, keratinocytes have been shown to activate cytokine production and influence inflammatory markers.8 Morgellons patients also demonstrate inflammatory markers that indicate cytokine release.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In chronic BDD infection, there is evidence that spirochetes damage keratinocytes, resulting in the formation of unusual keratin fibers.15,16 Spirochetes have been shown to activate cytokines and other inflammatory markers.86 Keratinocytes influence inflammatory cell movement and retention in the epidermis via cytokine release.87,88 Tissue damage is aggravated by neutrophil infiltration, inflammatory mediators, and cytokines.15,16 Epidermal proliferation, hyperplasia, and influx of neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes result in damage to keratinocytes and production of abnormal keratin filaments. The production of keratinolytic toxins by treponemes has been proposed8 and B. burgdorferi has been shown to stimulate inflammatory chemokine secretion.&quot;</p>

<p>This got me thinking, if bovine digital dermatitis is caused by a spirochetal infection, and theoretically, based upon this peer reviewed article, is also the cause of Morgellons, wouldn&#39;t keratin like filaments and cytokine release in the skin cause itching/bug feeling? Wouldn&#39;t it feel like microscopic needles of keratin and collagen (Yes, fibroblasts are being activated) inbetween/inside cells/in your skin?</p>

<p>This got me digging. </p>

<p>Most of my end research comes here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/83kg0q/is_lyme_disease_the_new_aids_what_you_need_to_know/dviqurf/?st=jmrmwxwt&amp;amp;sh=0a08a7d7">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/83kg0q/is_lyme_disease_the_new_aids_what_you_need_to_know/dviqurf/?st=jmrmwxwt&amp;amp;sh=0a08a7d7</a></p>

<p>It was 100% manufactured unintentionally, for all those wanting to ask this question, I name the bacteria that causes it, it was released ACCIDENTALLY AND UNKNOWINGLY, and happened to be quite the little mutator/evolver. </p>

<p>None of that matters now, AT ALL, what matters is stopping it, figuring out how to fuck its shit. </p>

<p>First comment, is in regards to Morgellons, there are many more comments to come folks, c:</p>
</div>

<div class="comment mb-3 ml-0" data-depth="0" data-id="e70tzn6">
    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Catsarenotreptilians.html">Catsarenotreptilians</a> 2018-09-22</p>
    <div class="md"><p>THE SECOND COMMENT IS HERE FOLKS, AND THIS ONE IS WAY FACKING DIFFERENT.</p>

<p>ACROLEIN FOLKS, your probably thinking &quot;What the fuck is this guy going on about, what is this chemical, google tells me its nothing important, its fuck all, why you talking about some random fucking chemical dude on reddit?&quot;</p>

<p>The reason I am talking about this chemical today is because glycerol is added to cigarettes, do you know what happens when glycerol dehydrates, and also when plant matter improperly combusts? It creates acrolein, acrolein hates humans, it fucking hates us, but its pretty damn silent about its hate, it does its damage in the long run. </p>

<p>When you smoke a cigarette there is added glycerol, that added glycerol breaks down into acrolein, that acrolein then bonds with an adduct bond to your glutathione, which is the main antioxidant of the body, and is pretty helpful for preventing cellular aging. </p>

<p>But it gets worse, acrolein, hates humans soo much, that when it comes contact with glutathione, it turns glutathione against humans, the adduct bond creates glutathionylpropionaldehyde, this also depletes the glutathione, I will give an example:</p>

<p>Acrolein fucking hates humans, meets glutathione, it loves humans, but acrolein fucks glutathione and gets stuck in glutathione creating a whole new human hating fucking monster through DBZ fusion. Glutathionylpropionaldehyde.</p>

<p>Before I go any further, I have to explain what Acrolein does exactly, want to find out? </p>

<p>&quot;&quot;The biological effects of acrolein are a consequence of its reactivity towards biological nucleophiles such as guanine in DNA and cysteine, lysine, histidine, and arginine residues in critical regions of nuclear factors, proteases, and other proteins. Acrolein adduction disrupts the function of these biomacromolecules which may result in mutations, altered gene transcription, and modulation of apoptosis.&quot; Which is from <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mnfr.200700412">here</a>.</p>

<p>That leads to cancers, and organ failures, and likely some fucked up diseases, but this is just acrolein...</p>

<p>Glutathionylpropionaldehyde.</p>

<p>It fucking hates us even more. So Acrolein also has the ability to create ROS or free radicals, which are bad, and numerous, but what is really bad, is when acrolein FUCKS THE SHIT out of glutathione and once again DBZ fuses into the hate monster of hell. </p>

<p>But then comes along Glutathionylpropionaldehyde.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0891584993900583">So the following information is from this peer reviewed article</a></p>

<p>&quot;&quot;The fact that glutathionylpropionaldehyde is a more potent stimulator of oxygen radical formation than acrolein indicates that glutathionylpropionaldehyde is a toxic metabolite of acrolein and may be responsible for some of the in vivo toxicity of acrolein.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>Anyone know what an anti-oxidant, it donates electrons to free radicals, to you know, calm them the FUCK DOWN, like little fucking hyper Caillou&#39;s everywhere. Everyone fucking HATES THOSE CANCER CAUSING FUCKERS. </p>

<p>Anyway, glutathione is an antioxidant, the most important antioxidant, not just your regular vitamin C, glutathione is that antioxidant king, its like, the Don of the antioxidants. This is also a true statement, but other antioxidants will actually work better in the presence of this antioxidant, its just that fucking good (Not really, most antioxidants are actually meant to be taken together, like think of a tomato, you got lycopene, vitamin C, and vitamin A, and thats all I can think of, those are all considered antioxidants, and eating 2 tomatoes will actually have more antioxidant effect vs avoiding antioxidants and taking a 400mg or whatever vitamin C chewable. </p>

<p>Basically, smoking is very bad, the addition of glycerol in cigarettes accelerates the negative effects. The negative in-depth effects are caused by acrolein depleting glutathione in the body producing glutathionylpropionaldehyde and creating more ROS/free radicals (damaging hyper fuckers who want to be fed some electrons, think hyper over-active Caillous).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Third, this one is a little less sciency and a bit more theoretical and fun discussion.</p>

<p>So this is just a random comment, I don&#39;t have many peer reviewed articles on these topics, but I am sure if you dug, you would find something. Some are also theoretical, and some have also been tested and had secondary issues preventing them being used sufficiently. </p>

<p>I am going to talk about cancer cures. </p>

<p>Now with the new immunotherapy they have out, there really is no excuse not to perfect cancer prevention and reverse cancer growth. </p>

<p>But 2-3 years ago, this comment would have been all the rage.</p>

<p>EMF generator. </p>

<p>During mitosis, little spindles come forward to pull the parents duplicate chromosomes apart to pull one set of the duplicate pair to the daughter cell, so well, you know, replicate, and as long as they both get one full half of the chromosomes, they can repair the other side, and continue splitting/growing, like a tumor, or you know, like your butthole or something. </p>

<p>Their is a polarity that occurs during this time, and using a generator that creates a small EMF field during growth stages (lets say they know how to &quot;stimulate&quot; or cause the tumor/cancer to &quot;grow/etc&quot;), which would cause the duplicate chromosomes to not split correctly, causing the daughter cell to go into apoptosis basically immediately, and following that, apoptosis occurs in the parent cell, leading to a reduction in the original size of a tumor. </p>

<p>This has been used before on some Swedish Bicyclist or something. </p>

<p>Monoclonal antibodies. As per google: &quot;Monoclonal antibodies (mAb or moAb) are antibodies that are made by identical immune cells that are all clones of a unique parent cell. Monoclonal antibodies can have monovalent affinity, in that they bind to the same epitope (the part of an antigen that is recognized by the antibody).&quot;</p>

<p>What this means is that it can directly target cancers with radioactive isotopes or with cancer medication. </p>

<p>Now, this one is sketchy, but its called sodium dichloroacetate. It is known to cause mitochondria within tumors to awaken, the mitochondria immediately recognize the cell is compromised and they go into apoptosis (cell death), leading to a cell/a part of the cancer/tumor, being destroyed. </p>

<p>Now, on my fourth comment, I will get into explaining how marijuana/THC has been proven to cure some forms of cancer, specifically glioma cells. Look out for the fourth comment folks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>HEY KID, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THE ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM? HOW MANY FUCKWITS HAVE TRIED TO TELL YOU RANDOM SHIT? DO YOU KNOW REMEMBER THOSE MYLELIN SHEATH&#39;S THAT COVER YOUR NERVES, PROTECTING THEM? REMEMEBER THOSE FUCKING PHOSPHOLIPID BILAYERS AND SHIT FROM HIGH SCHOOL? Well apparently their not just structural, we found out that there is basically a secondary fatty acid signalling system, and that is what the endocannabinoid system is, yuh. (As per google/wikipedia on endocannabinoid system: The endocannabinoid system is involved in regulating a variety of physiological and cognitive processes including fertility,[1] pregnancy,[2] during pre- and postnatal development,[3] appetite, pain-sensation, mood, and memory)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jbc.org/content/271/32/19251.short">http://www.jbc.org/content/271/32/19251.short</a></p>

<p>&quot;Altogether, these data strongly suggest for the first time that activation of the sphingomyelin-ceramide pathway may play a pivotal role in the oxLDL-induced SMC proliferation and atherogenesis. &quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15958274">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15958274</a></p>

<p>&quot;Sustained ceramide accumulation in tumor cells mediates cannabinoid-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by in vitro and in vivo studies. This effect seems to be due to the impact of ceramide on key cell signalling systems such as the extracellular signal-regulated kinase cascade and the Akt pathway.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12531545">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12531545</a></p>

<p>&quot;This enzyme is regulated by several mechanisms, including the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated protein FAN (for factor associated with N-SMase activation) and oxidative stress. &quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0300_313">https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0300_313</a></p>

<p>&quot;Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol, the main active component of marijuana, induces apoptosis of transformed neural cells in culture.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot; intratumoral administration of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol and the synthetic cannabinoid agonist WIN-55,212-2 induced a considerable regression of malignant gliomas in Wistar rats and in mice deficient in recombination activating gene 2. Cannabinoid treatment did not produce any substantial neurotoxic effect in the conditions used. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Experiments with two subclones of C6 glioma cells in culture showed that cannabinoids signal apoptosis by a pathway involving cannabinoid receptors, sustained ceramide accumulation and Raf1/extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: THC or CBD oil intake increases ceramide levels, generated by hydrolysis of the membrane sphingophospholipid sphingomyelin (SM) through the action of a sphingomyelinase, and the increase ceramide levels control programmed cell death, and much more that we are still learning.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my fifth comment and its in regards to the nature of the thread.</p>

<p>In regards to this threads direction, science is not flawed, its that corporate interests sway outcomes, especially when a dozen researchers realize its either lie and get an extra 500k to live for a few years and add more research under your belt, or tell the truth, have the corporation back away from that research group, they lose funding, now people have to move, etc, some may have to go back to other countries if they can&#39;t find work in a reasonable time, etc. </p>

<p>This is the sad state of society, not of science itself. </p>

<p>I am a big theorist, I will sit here and tell you I believe we are all Yahweh, an enlightened/higher frequency being lowered his frequency to come and aide us, we corrupted them, and now I believe everyone is in limbo and no one has true power. </p>

<p>I can also tell you there is no god and we are inside a black hole, the event horizon of a black hole holds all the information/data, it is always gathering, if specific data hasn&#39;t been received yet/something hasn&#39;t been sucked in yet that is not present within the event horizon, theoretically, that thing is impossible until it collects the necessary information, outside our black hole is another universe, with another event horizon, and you can imagine it infinitely, like a cell dividing, and gathering the necessary resources to mature or some shit. </p>

<p>I can also theorize we are all electromagnetic beings who are being reincarnated repeatedly by frequency vampires who lack souls, but possess the ability to persist through another means beyond light, which theoretically, our souls are said to be comprised of. </p>

<p>I can add to my first crazy theory and say reincarnation is a process of preservation, if the soul doesn&#39;t ascend, they are reincarnated and once again given the chance to do what they are supposed to do/their mission/whatever. </p>

<p>When it comes to science though, its there, its just it requires thorough navigating and anyone who has their body in the room has to follow the rules or they are removed, me being an outsider peering in through multiple windows, one outside the room in the hallway, and one with a view in the room, basically, if it is their bread and butter, it is necessary to make sacrifices in order to survive in certain circumstances, either literally by putting food in your mouth or academically by submitting papers and continuing research to show off and try to get more research funds/etc. </p>

<p><em>I have no hate when I say this, its a true generalization</em></p>

<p>People are smarter, they can process things faster this day and age, but people lack understanding multiple concepts/sciences, so I can read through papers pertaining to diseases, biology, biochem, and I can verify (In my opinion, based upon method, setup, depth of study, if its been cited by a newer study, if it refers to good, older studies, etc), you give me physics papers and I won&#39;t be able to tell you SHIT. </p>

<p>So its not that people are dumb, its just always circumstances. </p>

<p>The biggest problem that will be presented in this thread will be corporate interests, I dotted in other things that will likely be ignored, as well as my four other comments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Business interests have always compromised just about any innovation. Either in an attempt to maintain and older technology or to hold fast and monopolize another etc. That is unchanged for a long time as given example by Vespasian and Titus deciding to not accept a steam engine because it would upset the slave trade.</p>

<p>the peer review system used for gatekeeping is a little harder to get to, but the absence of peer review is quite apparent and that can support gatekeeping for certain. There simply is not a lot of peer review that goes on because of the sheer amount of research being done.</p>

<p>Incorrect premises are corrected all the time through the scientific method. Galileo was doing it too.</p>

<p>I think there are a greater amount of people who simply cannot grasp the basics of a given science and so, in their ignorance they adopt a suspicious attitude. God forbid they should actually recognize their own ignorance and try to overcome it. Funny thing how ego works and the more ignorant a person is and combined with age, the less likely you are to explain much of anything. The ignorance is so deeply ingrained it becomes hopeless. There is a lot of this going on. As populations grow, there will be even more, because the heart of it seems to be that no matter the change, it stays the same as there are particular dictates of our own human nature that we cannot by that very same nature break free of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You start out with very insightful knowledge:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In science we believe everything has been proven. That is a huge misconception. They can&#39;t prove anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But you&#39;re incorrect to expect anything more than this. Turns out, the only things you can &quot;prove&quot; in the technical sense are to be found in &quot;closed, logical systems&quot; like math and formal logic. Those systems deal with deductive logic: if truth goes into valid arguments, you can guarantee truth as a product.</p>

<p>Science, forensics, fraud investigations, applied maths, all the other forms of &quot;figuring things out&quot; or &quot;verifying theories&quot; that exist deal in <em>inductive</em> logic.</p>

<p>Inductive logic cannot guarantee the truth of the product <strong>even if the inputs are true.</strong> That&#39;s why science can&#39;t &quot;prove&quot; anything, however, it can <em>demonstrate</em> theories. And it&#39;s the system of figuring things out that we depend upon the most.</p>

<p>For example, if you mix vinegar and baking soda 10,000 times, and each time it does the same thing, you still cannot guarantee the reaction on the 10,001st time. But science can answer one question with certainty: is this theory false? The answers come in 3 varieties: </p>

<ul>
<li>1. Yes</li>
<li>2. Not yet</li>
<li>3. The theory is meaningless</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s all we can get from science.</p>

<p>To sum up, most people don&#39;t understand a goddamned thing about science or evidence, yet they&#39;re ready to take a shit on all the products of scientific investigation regardless of methods employed to reach various conclusions. In order to tell if results are being manipulated, one must actually read the study and look for ways for the data to get flubbed. </p>

<p>I&#39;d bet my testicles not a single &quot;science denier&quot; has the patience or wherewithall to do that. </p>

<p>Im not saying don&#39;t vaccinate, im saying there is clear fear mogering ti anyone who chooses anything less than <strong>blindly accepting all vaccines</strong>, like if you choose to delay, space out, or swap mmr for singles, all of these are viavblr and the CDC says the only reason they pump so many at once is to ensure everyone is fully
is vaccinated.  </p>

<p>If you dont get the flu ahot you&#39;re a baby killing monster and you will be witch hunted by the <del>cult</del> science fanboys even if you have all other vaccines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess the thought process is that the earth is flat and motionless by all accounts of my personal experience and I have come to find the ball earth evidence insufficient for my personal belief. Part of the mind fuck is that you have to prove the earth is flat based on the axiom the earth is a ball.</p>

<p>Look up the history of Jesuit spread of ball earth theory in the 17th century, China thought the earth was flat until 1600s when a Jesuit priest gained favor in the Imperial court. They must be crazy af in China yo. History of Antarctica, like how it wasn&#39;t discovered until 1820 and the Operations there with Admiral Byrd and his infamous TV interview. Ancient cultures and the belief in flat earth and a firmament, extra credit for Werhner von Braun&#39;s tombstone bible verse. See Operation Domino, Fishbowl, Starfish. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a good chunk of stuff to start with. </p>
