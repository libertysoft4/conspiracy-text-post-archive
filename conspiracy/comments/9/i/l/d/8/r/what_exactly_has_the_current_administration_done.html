    <div class="md"><p>So you want to blame Clinton for placing the law and Sessions for enforcing it for only two weeks. And it wasn&#39;t cruel of Trump to allow Sessions to enforce the cruel law for two weeks? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How the Hillary Clinton campaign deliberately “elevated” Donald Trump with its “pied piper” strategy</p>

<p>In its self-described &quot;pied piper&quot; strategy, the Clinton campaign proposed intentionally cultivating extreme right-wing presidential candidates, hoping to turn them into the new &quot;mainstream of the Republican Party&quot; in order to try to increase Clinton&#39;s chances of winning.</p>

<p>The Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee called for using far-right candidates &quot;as a cudgel to move the more established candidates further to the right.&quot; Clinton&#39;s camp insisted that Trump and other extremists should be &quot;elevated&quot; to &quot;leaders of the pack&quot; and media outlets should be told to &quot;take them seriously.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You‘re right, the plan to elevate trump was certainly scripted. I don‘t think it went the way the DNC was hoping. </p>

<p>On one side they definitely are picked in advance. On the republican side however the primaries are a democratic process. If the republican voters don&#39;t want someone (the party itself was pushing either Kasich or Bush) then they pick someone else.</p>

<p>The pragmatic choice is to realize that neither furthers his policies, so he should have stated as such. He could have added a personal preference for Clinton, but policy-wise it really doesn&#39;t matter whether Clinton won or Trump won. Both had issues where they came close to Bernie (Tariffs and isolationism for Trump, Healthcare and education for clinton)</p>

<p>Painted as, yes, but that smear wouldn&#39;t have stuck if he had simply used the opportunity to picture himself as a less loudmouthed proponent of protectionist measures.</p>

<p>Apart from that, the margin in these states was already slim. You don&#39;t need all of them to not vote Trump to actually make the difference.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also his policies, while I believe would have bettered the nation, are simply not acceptable to large portions of America.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about that. He sold them well in any case, and given a national platform. And if the goal is to not get Trump elected, taking away part of the protest vote and the blue collars would have gone a long way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People are struggling and self centered. “Why should we give money/healthcare/education loan forgiveness to others when I’m struggling to maleness the mortgage” is an unfortunate viewpoint of many.</p>

<p>Ideally, you work out a way that leaves the middle class well alone in order to finance this. Though I have to agree that that&#39;s a tall order.</p>

<p>One, “these people” (those corralled by this explain-all) are not fucking stupid. They don’t communicate in cryptic nonsense because they don’t have to — they reside, work, and play in an echelon outside of the reach of the type of people attracted to the Q worldview. </p>

<p>Maybe the fact the media was just following it’s marching orders? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How the Hillary Clinton campaign deliberately “elevated” Donald Trump with its “pied piper” strategy</p>

<p>In its self-described &quot;pied piper&quot; strategy, the Clinton campaign proposed intentionally cultivating extreme right-wing presidential candidates, hoping to turn them into the new &quot;mainstream of the Republican Party&quot; in order to try to increase Clinton&#39;s chances of winning.</p>

<p>The Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee called for using far-right candidates &quot;as a cudgel to move the more established candidates further to the right.&quot; Clinton&#39;s camp insisted that Trump and other extremists should be &quot;elevated&quot; to &quot;leaders of the pack&quot; and media outlets should be told to &quot;take them seriously.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like how the Clinton Campaign, DNC, and MSM were all conspiring together long before Sanders conceded the nomination? </p>

<p>Here’s a list of reporters who ate dinner with Hillary 2 days before she announced her presidential run:</p>

<p>Since you’ve read everything I linked, what exactly from what I linked does not back up my answer to that question? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump is absolutely part of the problem</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did I say he wasn’t? Or did I just point out that the media is the one who were gaslighting and spotlighting his tweets and statements, which likely was the primary reason this issue got so blown out of proportion?    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He has been tweeting and saying incredibly divisive things since the Obama years</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And is that fully because of Trump, or the changing media environment and volatility of public opinion that Trump merely capitalized on?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>To think otherwise is near-sighted and ignorant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All there we go. The debate ending buzzwords. </p>

<p>That&#39;s only partially true. The Fiat Ursury Federal reserve system creates debt by learning us all of the printed money, same with the IMF loans, selling debt to foreign countries, and Many other systems of debt fuck the whole country in the ass</p>

<p>Yeah I know, and that has to be fixed, but so does the unfair Post WW2 Tariffs designed to help rebuild EU and others which were systematically designed to be unfair to us at the sake of others rebuilding. That&#39;s no longer the case, and they should ha e been renegotiated by the 80s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy cow, that is some of the most revisionlist opinion pieces I have ever read. The other countries even signed the deal (abet with a different name) after Trump pulled out of the deal. The only reason the TPP was abandoned was because Trump pulled out of it according to practically  every source out there. Heck even the Australian PM called Trump after the election asking for him to reconsider (but the source you quoted said that Australian didn&#39;t want the deal which is objectively wrong). I think the sources you linked may have been confused with the Clean Power Act which was dead because of legal challenges around the same time. At least I hope because otherwise they are lying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because a lot of the work so far has been done behind the scenes, out of public view, mainly because what&#39;s shaping a lot of the public view is the MSM, but the MSM has vested interests in keeping the status quo, so even if they were doing a lot of the things in front of the scene, you wouldn&#39;t hear about it regardless because of MSM</p>

<p>So for now, a lot of it has been done backside, see list of CEOs/politicians resignations that really started going fast back in Oct 17 but had started a bit before that. Why are all those people resigning for no apparent reasons if nothing&#39;s happening?</p>

<p>We&#39;re just now about to enter the phase where everyone reveals their hands, as elections are nearing close, the stakes are high and everyone wants the top spot</p>

<p>Can you give me an example of this? Because there have been a lot of pro-establishment policies and moves made by the current administration that Trump supporters conveniently overlook. </p>

<p>Like the bombing of Syria under false pretenses for example. Or the multi billion dollar defense bill that Trump authorized. Do we really need more military spending and more war?</p>

<p>He also campaigned on Saudi Arabia being a huge purveyor of terrorism and even condemned them for their involvement in 9/11, yet he signed a deal for several billion dollars providing weapons to them. Then, there&#39;s the false promises of &quot;I will arrest Hillary Clinton&quot;, as well as the swamp monster cabinet I outlined in my post. </p>

<p>I love that one!</p>

<p>Riddle me this:</p>

<p>-US: &quot;We have fired 59 tomahawk missiles, 57 of which reached their intended targets.&quot;</p>

<p>-RU: &quot;The Syrian air base was hit by 22 tomahawk missiles&quot;</p>

<p>Where (would you theorize) are the missing 36 missiles, 2 of which did not reach their intended targets, as per official statements from impacted parties.</p>

<p>My thoughts exactly every time the Syria missile strike gets brought up. Fuck, that&#39;s not what the establishment wanted. The establishment wanted boots and tanks on the ground. They wanted a full on Iraq-style invasion. Check out the third presidential debate to hear it straight out of Hillary&#39;s mouth. Trump did <em>not</em> give the establishment what they wanted. He gave them a little taste and then went a completely different direction.</p>

<p>Also &#39;rapeugees&#39; is a nice way to talk about those who have been forced to risk everything to save their families. I would you appreciate being born in a stable country more than you imply.</p>

<p>Also, as an employed liberal shill who makes more than you, I feel for you and your ignorance coming on a conspiracy board to defend the Government and hate others for no reason.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as this admin could be said to be playing with “energies,” the only observable benefit happens to be short term economic stimpaks and populist optimism. </p>

<p>In a war of grievances, the disenfranchised American clings to any remaining semblance of the American Dream — Trump personifies this, allowing him to safely fjord the anti-establishment river like a non-ideological Planeswalker (I’m not convinced he maintains an ideology).</p>

<p>Coincidentally, he was dubbed the “Pied Piper” candidate by the HRC opposition strategy team which is interesting on several levels, not the least of which could be strategic infiltration from shared bedfellows to preserve the balance of power and status quo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://reason.com/blog/2017/02/27/trumps-fake-crackdown-on-sex-trafficking">Here&#39;s a good article about why that claim is untrue.</a> The basic points are</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For starters, the 2014 data she links to is far from a complete account of U.S. sex-trafficking arrests that year. It reflects incomplete state-level arrest numbers from just 26 U.S. states, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. It does not include all state sex-trafficking arrests, by far, nor does it include anysex trafficking arrests by federal agencies such as the FBI and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which make thousands of sex trafficking arrests annually (though far fewer trafficking indictments and convictions).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the specifics of the arrests </p>

<blockquote>
<p>478 people arrested in a statewide California sting that included zero sex-trafficking arrests, according to a press release from the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#39;s Department. One-hundred and forty-two men were arrested for attempting to pay consenting adult women for sexual activity. Thirty-six men were arrested for pimping. The rest of those arrested—300 in total—were women taken in on prostitution charges or people in trouble for charges unrelated to commercial sexual activity.</p>

<p>178 men arrested in Texas for soliciting prostitution from an undercover cop posing as a consenting adult sex worker. The stings were part of a nationwide &quot;Johns Suppression Initiative&quot; organized annually by Cook County, Illinois, Sheriff Tom Dart.</p>

<p>Four &quot;pimps&quot; and 12 people arrested on unspecified charges during a month-long Detroit operation concluded two days after Trump took office.</p>

<p>11 people arrested as part of a &quot;five-month cyber-sting operation led by the Spotsylvania Sheriff&#39;s Office Child Exploitation Unit in partnership with the Northern Virginia Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.&quot; The sting—a To Catch a Predator-style operation involving police posing online as a 13-year-old into older men—began in October 2016 and ended in early February.</p>

Every news media outlet, the tech companies, all of Hollywood, and sports. Late night television, and all of thier effort has only solidfied Trump&#39;s base even further. Unfortunately I do live in a very xenophobic racist area, and the biggest bigots love this guy. I am more interested in this because I find it fascinating. But I am not fooled for a second. Trump is all about himself. However he is heavily invested in this country and captalism, and wants to see his businesses last for his family. Nearly all of the top politicans hate him with a fury. He hijacked the highest office without going through the proper channels. Now he is somewhat building a third party. And really it&#39;s just a second party as the R&#39;s and D&#39;s are just two sides of the same coin. This will not be allowed. </p>

<p>What exactly has the current administration done so far for people to think they are &quot;anti-establishment&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Easy.  He has been himself.    By being himself, he has become a target of the establishment.  They have attempted to nullify the election and remove or prevent his power through such things as the &quot;Muh Russia&quot; narrative, and the &quot;Hillary didn&#39;t mean to break the law, let&#39;s let her go&quot; thing.  </p>

<p>History is not going to look kindly on these things, and on those establishment actors pissing on the constitution and other laws so freely.  I thank the stars every day for having helped get him elected just for him becoming a lightning rod and his attracting the corrupt elements of opposition that he has, leaving them open to exposure.  </p>

<p>And he&#39;s only 1/8th the way through his presidency!  Just think what other revelations are to come in the next six years!  Just think of what other antics his unhinged opposition are going to try!  This is, as they say, the best timeline ever!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The repeal of H1B has benefits to all American workers. It was a loophole to replace workers with cheap foreign replacements, now the loophole is closed. This contributes to higher wages for US workers. Trump&#39;s executive order to fire Federal employees at will, now he freezes their automatic pay raises, in which they already make too much and have unsustainable pensions. Repealing the individual mandate just like he said he would. &quot;Right to try&quot; legislation was pushed through by Trump, possibly saving millions if lives and giving those with terminal illness the dignity to treat their illness however they wish. All of these positions are right on in my mind, as a liberal. I can only imagine conservatives are even more enthusiastic. </p>
