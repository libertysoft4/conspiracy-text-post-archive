<p>Seriously no grown up men would act like the mods here unless they are just pretending to be retarded in order to draw attention from important issues. It&#39;s also funny how this has become a right wing subreddit over the years and everything related to the current head of state will be removed</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do the mods have such a pro-Trump bias on a sub where they&#39;re supposed to represent non-partisanship? It seems like it&#39;s almost being forced down our throats. You have to ask yourself why would TPTB want to paint this community as alt-right Trump cheerleaders? Trump, IMO, was a false prophet that was supposed to &quot;herd&quot; us and crash us into a wall. Some people took the bait, others didn&#39;t, but the paid infiltrators online are reinforcing the whole thing and you can bet they&#39;ve infiltrated or compromised the moderating positions on several online forums. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every time there&#39;s a &quot;happening&quot; this sub gets flooded with new users. </p>

<p>Look at the vote count in <strong>any</strong> post made today and tell me this sub is pro-trump. Anything pro-trump gets mass downvoted. Anything pro-left gets mass upvoted. OP is full of it. </p>

<p>This country voted basically 50/50 for Trump/Hillary and that was <em>before</em> Trump has had all this success with the ecomony and jobs. </p>

<p>But you can&#39;t tell it by the votes on Reddit. Reddit wants you to believe most people are antitrump. It&#39;s simply not true. </p>

<p>There is no Moon Landing conspiracy without....or No JFK conspiracy without...</p>

<p>Based on leaning context only. Then the left tends to want a larger more powerful and controlling government. The right wants smaller and smaller, the smallest government possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the one hand, the moderators are humans too and entitled to their own opinions. I don&#39;t have a problem with moderators holding their own beliefs.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it can become an issue if it seeps into their responsibility as a moderator. I agree that there are cases that can be pointed to that may be biased towards Trump. At the same time, I don&#39;t believe the sub is a &quot;propaganda tool&quot;. I think you&#39;d be very hard pressed to find someone who didn&#39;t have a favorable view of Trump &quot;swayed&quot; by the actions of the moderators on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

<p>A very significant amount of people who use this sub use it as they see fit, some of which are Trump supporters, which is only fitting. Not everyone is going to be ardently anti-Trump. I think a healthy balance of pro and anti Trump is indicative of a healthy community. </p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t see anything &quot;Anti-Trump&quot; removed unless it&#39;s instigative. If it&#39;s blatantly just to start an emotional argument without basis in confirmed fact, or if it&#39;s an argument that&#39;s been hashed out a million times with no progress at all, I could see why those get removed. It&#39;s just spam at that point.</p>
