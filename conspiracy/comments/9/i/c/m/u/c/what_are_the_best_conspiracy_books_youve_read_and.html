I don&#39;t think there are many topics that are too farfetched for me; if anything, it will help my awareness of a certain topic or help me narrow down my opinions. Government conspiracies are always a good read, but I guess I lean more towards &quot;other-worldly&quot; topics, such as different dimensions, time travel, aliens, etc. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Psychological operations (PSYOPs) are the preferred method by which shadow men socially engineer the masses&#39; consent on a myriad of important issues. The author provides numerous examples of how social engineers have modified the public&#39;s perceptions and attitudes about America&#39;s founders, slavery, financial markets, dating and mating customs, self-perception, and a laundry list of other matters people have no idea were socially engineered. The reader will become expert on the character of the men who work in the shadows whose sole reason for living is to control others in service to accumulating wealth and power, of which, they never, ever, have enough. The reader is provided a step-by-step program that promises to strip away shadow men&#39;s brainwashing of them and return the reader to his natural state of freedom and happiness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hesitate to call them &#39;Conspiracy&#39; books as what is it them is 100% verifiable. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the Sinister Forces trilogy by Peter Levenda. It starts roughly with the founding of America (but touches on themes from pre-history) and runs all the way through to almost modern day. </p>

<p>Highlights are: The Nazi influence in the west that carried on after the war (Operation Paperclip), the unlikely connections between Charles Manson and the JFK assassination, the profound changes in world politics after the first nuclear bombs were used and cults like jonestown etc.</p>

<p>It really is a comprehensive history of the Occult influence in the world without all the usual Conspiracy speculation as to what it could mean. He even says in parts stuff the effect of &#39;i won&#39;t speculate as to why this happened the way it did because as a historian I can&#39;t in good conscience say things I cannot back up with documentation&#39;. Just cold hard facts without bias. </p>

<p>Programmed to Kill by Dave McGowan is an amazing, terrifying book about the construction of the serial killer phenomenon. And so much more. His book on Laurel Canyon more or less proves that the psychedelic acid counterculture was manufactured as a CIA psyop. </p>

<p>Holy Blood Holy Grail and Wounded in the House of my Friends. </p>

<p>The book of the Damned by Charles Fort for historical X Files type weird history. </p>

<p>The work of Jacques Vallee and John Keel for UFO type weirdness. </p>

<p>Mysterious Fires and Lights by Vincent Gaddis for weird electromagnetic phenomenon and the electrical universe hypothesis </p>

He won a lawsuit for two people who, as children, were subject to satanic ritual abuse for the purpose of trauma-induced mind control by the government, and were sent all over the world to have sex with powerful people. The one guy kept a journal of everything that he went through. It is very disturbing, and all documented with factual evidence that was able to win a lawsuit. Sadly the documentary made about the lawsuit never aired, so it is relatively unknown outside of conspiracy circles.</p>

I&#39;m not easily moved but I killed this book in 3 days and had nightmares for several nights. This is the kind of behavior that is so cruel the masses would not be able to conceive of  another human doing such a thing. For that same reason it&#39;s allowed to continue. Although I did not enjoy reading it, it&#39;s a topic that needs a bright light cast upon it and I highly recommend the book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a fiction book, and it was actually posted here by a reddit user. Its called 1 Trillion Dollars. I really enjoyed it. Its about a pizza delivery guy who inherits 1 trillion dollars and he tries to change the world but quickly learns about the power systems in place. I only bought it because a user said he wrote it but i genuinely enjoyed the book.</p>
