<p>The thing is, the rich found clever ways around it. They put it in trusts and non-profits. They&#39;ve been doing this for years even with the estate tax. Taxes only hurt the rest of us just like most if not all taxes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just the US federal estate tax. It&#39;s all the taxes that come with the death and inheritances of an individuals &quot;estate&quot;. Whether federal or state. Also, estate valuation of 5.4 million is not that much money. Two married lawyers or doctors could easily have an estate valued at that. Hell, even small businesses owners could. Then there is the trickle down effect of it. </p>

<p>For example: Small business owner with multiple business chains, dies and the family gets hit with a heavy tax. They have to pay the tax and in order to make it work, they have to close down one or two chains which makes their employees now unemployed. </p>

<p>In otherwords they are a failing business or a part of the 1% and are lying about the reason to close down the other businesses.</p>

<p>It&#39;s one of those arguments that&#39;s similar to not raising minimum wage. If you as a business owner cannot handle paying people a living wage, or cannot handle expected taxes - you are not a successful business owner.</p>

<p>Although we could simply skip that and have a tax grade like we did during America&#39;s Golden age. Top 5% pay 90% income taxes from all sources. Damn good republican plan that was, and I&#39;m amazed it isn&#39;t coming up for debate anymore.</p>

<p>Because most people won&#39;t be taxed when they day. The average person will never deal with the estate tax, especially since it was raised. Simply put the estate tax is <strong>over</strong> the average amount an American will be worth if all their assets and earnings over their entire lifetime were combined.</p>

<p>If you just work a 9-5 and you just buy one property, you will not hit an estate tax. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>5m isnt that much money. its not even enough to not have to work again if you want to live decently.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>5m just straight cash? Assuming taxes were already paid on that wealth accumulation that is more than enough for any American to live a lavish lifestyle from age 20 to age 80. That&#39;s 83k a year, that&#39;s more than you make. I can say that statistically as that&#39;s far above what the average American makes.</p>

<p>You inherently misunderstand criticism of capitalism.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not &#39;oh well you must not work hard enough if you&#39;re not successful hurr&#39; it&#39;s usually &#39;oh hey those that did get successful while enjoying the things taxes buy like security, infrastructure, and a secure consumer base then outcompetes you forever if you try to be competition to them, as there is no effective way to limit their wealth and they do not pay back into the society that created them in any meaningful way.&#39;</p>

<p>The Wealthy need to be taxed more, the majority of billionaires did nothing for their money except fight their way out of a vagina at one point. Familial wealth holding is inherently an oppressive system of the masses and is inevitable without other controls on wealth transfer or accumulation. To remove this is to say &#39;You know 1984? What if it was just privatized?&#39; and be happy with your Victory Gin.</p>

<p>&quot;If your US assets exceed $60,000 and your worldwide estate does not exceed $11.2 million
Because of the prorated unified credit provided under the tax treaty, you will not be subject to US estate tax if the value of your worldwide estate does not exceed $11.2 million. However, your estate will be required to file a US estate tax return to claim the treaty credits.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, taxes are a necessity. How we are taxed is disgusting. We  are taxed by all of the above. Where does the money come from to pay taxes? You the consumer, who pays for products and services, government, etc. Who pays you to have a job. They pay you with already taxed money from which you get taxed. It’s a never ending loop of taxes. 
End income taxes. Increase sales tax on everything but essential items. You make more, you spend more, you pay more taxes. You make little, you spend little, you pay little to no taxes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some taxes are necessary.  Some are immoral.   </p>

<p>I feel income tax is immoral as taxing a human being&#39;s labor is nearly akin to communism.  What a man earns by his sweat and blood should, obviously, be his to keep.  100%.  The taxes will come later, when he spends his keep.</p>

<p>In Canada and U.S. ,  Income tax perception was introduced as temporary measures to help in the respective countries war efforts.    </p>

<p>Once the wars passed and peace returned,  Governments never felt the need to remove the initially &quot;temporary&quot; measures that were put in place to tax the people.  Why kill the cash cow.  </p>

<p>Some claim, that both sides were manipulated and financed by the same organisation .  This  view hints that the &quot;pre-planned&quot; wars provide an occasion that government can use tax the citizens.  The citizens terrified by war violence and mass propaganda willingly accept being taxed for the noble cause of fighting evil and preventing a national war loss.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s one tax that pisses me off ... the REPEATED TAX that is charged EVERY time a used vehicle is sold</p>

<p>When a new car, say $35,000 USD is sold, it&#39;s taxed at ~8% depending where you live</p>

<p>That guy sells it 2-3 years later for $20,000 and the new owner is taxed again</p>

<p>2-3 years later, it sells for $10k ... then 5k, then 2k a couple of times</p>

<p>By the time that vehicle hits the junkyard, it&#39;s taxed at least triple the original purchase price tax was there to cover</p>

<p>high level discourse here, folks. thanks for that. very informative. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>knowledge does not become pointless just because it is not being used. knowledge is applied when needed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>posting on reddit in condescending tones isn’t action</p>
</blockquote>

<p>it&#39;s not an action? what is it then? posts like these are created to provoke discussion, and to awaken the intellect in those who have any.</p>
