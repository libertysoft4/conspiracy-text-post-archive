        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Was minding my own business on Sunday watching the Detroit game (big wins!). Herd some rustling around on my back porch and went to investigate. Found 2 guys running from my property, poked my head out, and ask wtf they were doing. 1 of them went bananas and started threatening to kill me amd informed me he was going to get his gun and shoot me. I told him I was calling the cops. He proceeded to charge at me and started getting very very close (Chest bumps, kissing distance) proceeding with threats. Then started running. I chased him on foot while on the line with 911 giving them street updates on the guys location. Eventually they lost both me and the police. </p>

<p>Walking home, about 100yds from my place, the guy and his friend were on the porch of another apartment. They recognized me and proceeded to follow me. At one point the guys hand was on his waistband as if he were carrying a weapon and charged me with more death threats.</p>

<p>Called the cops a 2nd time. They gave me a case number and left. Guy still not arrested. The owner of the buildings invited me over which is within line of sight of the guys apartment. He saw me there. Proceeded to charge accross the street saying, &quot;I swear on my dead brothers life I&#39;ll fuckin murder you.&quot; Dude proceeds to male more threats. Neighbors getting involved. </p>

<p>He calls the cops on me claiming I&#39;m harassing him. </p>

<p>The owner of the buildings testifies to the cops I was lawfully on the property and took no part in escalation of the situation. </p>

<p>Now where it gets fucked.</p>

<p>The guy, and his accomplice, falsify a police report and get me arrested for disorderly conduct. Claim I tried to rape them, and that I committed hate crimes via the n word. </p>

<p>Went to jail, as the victim. </p>

<p>Now I have to find a new place to live.</p>

<p>Never. Ever. Trust the system to protect you or do the right thing.</p>

<p>Liars in groups corroborating are extremely fucking dangerous to our way of life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to be rude, but you never expected the worst case scenario that already occurred.  If you haven&#39;t retained a lawyer, please do that.  You&#39;ll get a better deal.  (For reals.)</p>

<p>Also, have that building owner and/or any of the neighbors/witnesses call or go to the State&#39;s Attorneys office (the prosecutors) before your court date to tell them what really happened.  Maybe they&#39;ll end up dropping all charges.<br/>
Basically -- get out in front of this thing.       </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, when you come outside and find people who threaten to kill you, it kind of is escalating things to literally chase them on foot while calling the police. The picture you paint is of you running around your neighborhood making a big fucking scene. I understand they started it, but you stepped up to the plate. If you had gone back in your house to call the police, they might have shown up and found the guys causing trouble nearby.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying what you did was wrong, but it was pretty dangerous and not super smart. That or you made it all up.</p>

The police take too long and make everything more complicated than it should be. Sorry to hear this happened, that sucks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao!! I mean I&#39;ve taken plenty of firearm saftey courses and the last thing you want to do is shoot somebody unless you have to. Typically just the gun itself is enough to stop the situation. But then again, the dishonest prick would probably just come up with some bullshit against you in court about how you&#39;re in the wrong; kinda like the case where a home owner booby trapped his house and robbers broke in and lost his leg to the booby trap and the robber won in the court against the home owner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He cant lie if he&#39;s in a grave. Just like you cant defend yourself if youre in a grave. </p>

<p>If you are in a state where you can shoot trespassers onto your property, then it&#39;s your right. If you want to be nice shoot somewhere that&#39;s not fatal, to inhibit their motion.</p>
