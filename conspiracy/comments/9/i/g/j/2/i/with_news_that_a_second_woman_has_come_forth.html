        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://nypost.com/2018/09/23/avenatti-says-he-represents-woman-with-credible-information-about-kavanaugh/">https://nypost.com/2018/09/23/avenatti-says-he-represents-woman-with-credible-information-about-kavanaugh/</a></p>

<p>One of the articles covering this (can&#39;t find it and it&#39;s late) states that the magazine (I believe it&#39;s the New Yorker) &quot;helped the accuser to remember clearly&quot; what happened...I believe it also says it took six days for them to help her remember.</p>

<p>Now this is starting to sound like a conspiracy.</p>

<p>On top of that, Avenatti, none other than Stormy Daniels lawyer is representing the new accuser.</p>

<p>Maybe this is why it was taking Ford so long to respond about testifying? Maybe they were &quot;waiting for the magazine to help the accuser remember the events clearly&quot;...in other words...waiting until they had everyone&#39;s stories straight, including the witnesses willing to back up the new accuser?</p>

<p>Why Avenatti? Simple...High profile and already embedded in the MSM.</p>

<p>Why do I think Ginsburg will announce her retirement? Because of a statement she made recently regarding the Kavanaugh nomination and the politicizing of the process. </p>

<p>I also think this is going to have a serious impact on the midterms. I think it&#39;s going to motivate conservatives to vote.</p>

<p>Also of note, this story is going to rule the news cycle this week. Perfect time for the deep state to take advantage of the distraction and pull some shenanigans somewhere else.</p>

<p>Keep your eyes open.</p>

<p>They are shooting for the &quot;guilty by association&quot; angle with Kavanaugh&#39;s friend. </p>

<p>No one is backing up Ford&#39;s accusation, that&#39;s why they had to buy time to set up a whole new story for another accuser.</p>

<p>Ronan Farrow, one of the reporters who broke the story of a second sexual misconduct allegationagainst Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, said on Good Morning America that &quot;it is not accurate to say that those who knew [Kavanaugh] at the time dispute&quot; that the allegation is credible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>he “burden of proof” issue is the crux of the debate surrounding Dr. Ford’s accusations against Judge Kavanaugh precisely because she has produced no evidence to support her accusations against him. </p>

<p>She has no physical evidence, though that is unsurprising given that she is alleging a three-decades-old-crime. </p>

<p>More surprising, and more disconcerting, is the fact that the direct witnesses that she identified disclaim any knowledge of the crime she says they were present for; the fact that her therapist’s notes of her statements neither name Kavanaugh nor square with her other specific allegations; and the fact that Senator Feinstein herself did not pursue the allegations until after the regular confirmation hearings had ended and Kavanaugh was poised for a successful vote.</p>

<p>The allegation was conveyed to Democratic senators by a civil-rights lawyer. For Ramirez, the sudden attention has been unwelcome, and prompted difficult choices. She was at first hesitant to speak publicly, partly because her memories contained gaps because she had been drinking at the time of the alleged incident. In her initial conversations with The New Yorker, she was reluctant to characterize Kavanaugh’s role in the alleged incident with certainty. After six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney, Ramirez said that she felt confident enough of her recollections to say that she remembers Kavanaugh had exposed himself at a drunken dormitory party, thrust his penis in her face, and caused her to touch it without her consent as she pushed him away. Ramirez is now calling for the F.B.I. to investigate Kavanaugh’s role in the incident.</p>

<p>Ramirez told a number of friends that she still isn&#39;t sure Kavanaugh did it.</p>

<p>Avenatti has delivered nothing. Michael Cohen walked back the allegation that Trump knew about the meeting with Veselitskiya. </p>

<p>AND YES I THINK THESE PEOPLE ARE LYING.</p>

<p>THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO COUNTER THAT ASSESSMENT. </p>

<p>INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.</p>

<p>Do you understand how the justice system works in the United States?</p>

<p>Allegations without evidence should be dismissed without evidence.</p>

<p>Nobody is required to defend themselves against baseless allegations that have no evidence. </p>

<p>If its not clear to you that this is a sideshow to delay the confirmation, you need to open your eyes. An allegation with ZERO evidence, ZERO witnesses and ZERO corroboration should not and cannot halt a Supreme Court confirmation. Do you really even understand how absurd this whole thing has become? They are making a mockery of our country.</p>

<p>A 35 year old accusation where no police report was filed, not a single witness of hers has corroborated her story, one even changed her statement.  Accuser can&#39;t recant any details of the event that would aid in an investigation.<br/>
Original demand wanted BK to testify first?  In what f-d up world would that even be a legitimate demand?</p>

<p>My prediction, she will soon magically remember the date after seeing BK&#39;s summer calendar.  Mark my words.</p>

<p>Claims to be afraid of flying, yet finished her PHD in Hawaii
Claims shes not political yet social media archives prove otherwise
Claims this isn&#39;t politically motivated,  yet turned her statement into a politician instead of going to police</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t see this for the political hit job it is I feel bad for you. If it weren&#39;t, and it was about protecting women then Dems would be just as outraged at Keith Ellison and calling for his IMMMEDIATE resignation because unlike this Ford BS, his accuser has a police report, photos of physical harm, statements from witnesses, etc.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously, this is the 2nd accuser.  This BS isn&#39;t helping Ford&#39;s case either.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/23/us/politics/brett-kavanaugh-christine-blasey-ford-testify.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/23/us/politics/brett-kavanaugh-christine-blasey-ford-testify.html</a></p>

<p>One paragraph really stands out.  The fact that the accuser told those she wanted as witnesses that she herself couldn&#39;t even remember if it was in fact BK who exposed himself.</p>

<p>The Times had interviewed several dozen people over the past week in an attempt to corroborate her story, and could find no one with firsthand knowledge. Ms. Ramirez herself contacted former Yale classmates asking if they recalled the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr. Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry... But these bitches have to PROVE it. Doesn&#39;t anyone get that anymore? Our entire culture and civil society were founded on and have developed under this core principle. You are innocent until PROVEN guilty. This country was founded in part BECAUSE we told King George - Fuck you -  we want due process.</p>

<p>If this is allowed to proceed...if these flimsy accusations are allowed to derail this mans life without ever even a single moment of actual judicial process...we are looking at a dark, dark future. If you call yourself a man, you should be fucking furious. If you are a father to boys, you should be fucking terrified.</p>

<p>I sometimes wonder if this is just not some giant cultural shit test, and I pray for some prominent echo of a John Wayne type with some stones and cultural clout to stand up and say &quot;enough is enough, put up or shut up&quot;</p>

<p>As it is though, I see a future where no one wants to hire or work with women in any serious capacity because it just wont be worth the risk. A choking cloud of doubt, distrust and paranoia will settle over every workplace in the nation. This bullshit will set women&#39;s progress towards any sort of equality in the workplace and the board room back 100 years. </p>

<p>This will be one of the greatest Pyrrhic victories of all time.</p>

<p>Here lets try this...</p>

<p>35 years ago...in high school...DonteD92 grabbed my ass at a party. I don&#39;t remember many of the details, and I have no actual proof...but I swear it happened. Please have him fired.</p>

<p>How would you like to defend yourself DonteD92? oh no...wait..I&#39;m a woman...your a white guy...you cant...case closed...my accusation is all it takes apparently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not. </p>

<p>This isnt a trial by media. The mob will not decide if Kavanaugh will be confirmed or not. If it worked that way Trump would have been impeached a year ago and Bill Clinton would be in prison for rape.</p>

<p>The people who matter in this case are asking for an investigation by the FBI which has so far not been offered. The FBI has stated they would be happy to investigate as soon as they get the go ahead, but Trump is telling people that the FBI doesnt do this sort of thing and dont want to.</p>
