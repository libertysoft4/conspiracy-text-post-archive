        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think he died when he could have been saved. He OD’d while he was with his friends. They freaked out and called their drug dealers before they called an ambulance. They tried to revive him themselves, unsuccessfully. Afterwards, they cleared the house of drugs to selfishly make sure that nothing could be tied back to them. Only then did one of his friends finally call 911. But it was too late. He was already gone. Now the 911 caller refuses to out themselves, because they know that his death will be tied back to them and whatever dirty drugs they gave him. Had they called an ambulance when he first OD’d, instead of covering their own asses, there is a great possibility that he would still be here right now.</p>

<li>They didn’t think it was going to kill him (hopefully) </li>
<li>If you read my post, I believe the drugs were cut, which lead to the unexpected OD </li>

<li><p>I think that’s why they wiped the house first. They didn’t want to call an ambulance and also have to explain the drugs/ I’m curious to know how long this takes. Unless the whole house was covered in paraphernalia I feel like they could have cleaned up and sent somebody away with it by the time the EMT got there. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree with you, I think we all like to believe someone there would have the decency, but at the same time, humans have shown time and time again that there is an ability within some that allows them to completely disregard that feeling.

I don&#39;t think this is necessarily an issue of indecent people as much as idiocy and fear, I can&#39;t look in to their minds but I imagine someone there is having guilty conscience issues, especially if he was surrounded by friends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It happens ALL THE TIME.  There are literally billboards here in Northern Maryland that say &quot;Someone you&#39;re with overdosed?  DON&#39;T RUN, CALL 911&quot;.</p>

<p>Personally I&#39;ve lost 3 friends to heroin and the story is the same EVERY TIME.  They were found alone, twice by a parent, and once in the passenger seat of their own car, in a hospital parking lot. In all 3 cases, it was confirmed they weren&#39;t alone when they died.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be high on anything like heroin, but it seems like the first reaction is &quot;oh shit, let&#39;s get out of here cause I don&#39;t want to go to jail&quot;.  </p>
