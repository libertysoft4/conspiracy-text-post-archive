        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Now, I hate to bring politics into r/conspiracy and further widen the divide the elites worked so hard to keep wedged between us but this cannot be ignored any longer. We have seen the blatant brigading that has occurred over the past 3-4 days surrounding the &quot;divesttrump debacle&quot; in this subreddit. That same post being posted 5 times every hour almost; so why the push now?</p>

<p>The banning of r/greatawakening has emboldened the fact that any community with majority dissent to the MSM and left-wing narrative on this website will be caricatured and assassinated if it gains any traction. There are whole subs dedicated to being the literal thought police of reddit (TMOR, FTAR). The whole idea of these subs is to identify, caricature and ultimately put pressure on reddit to ban certain communities they do not like. That in itself is breaking the rules of Reddit itself and would make the founder of this website ashamed at the current state of the Reddit community. They turn blind eyes to billionaire funded media operations like Shareblue, CTR, Moveon <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9hsdj6/rosenstein_suggested_he_secretly_record_trump_and/e6e44fq/">Example</a>and SPLC <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9gnado/splc_pushing_to_get_t_d_banned_from_reddit/">SPLC Breakdown</a>  backed groups completely astroturfing major political subreddits and encouraging the bullying and identification of other communities that do not align with their agenda. They create a Russia boogeyman story to justify the eventual banning of their targets when in reality what was &quot;uncovered&quot; was just a few tiny websites originating in Russia getting upvoted a few times but that apparently means every mod on that subreddit is on Putin&#39;s payroll and the users of the sub are russian bots upvoting russian propaganda. It is a complete detachment from reality and a gross exaggeration of the truth. Do they really assume that everytime a trump supporter on r/t_d upvotes a positive article about trump on a small website from russia it means they are colluding with Russia actively? It is ridiculous and peanuts compared to what is really happening to reddit in terms of what they are accusing them of.</p>

<p>Their stated goals is to ban r/t_d and all subs associated, they are trying to target this sub as demonstrated by the ongoing brigades and attacks on the moderators of this subreddit. All conveniently timed before the midterms and as the SPLC has gotten into the action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They definitely have the right to have a community on reddit which many leftwing subs are openly trying to take away and are openly calling for a ban on a community with 600k+ subscribers and millions of visitors daily. They are engaging in very unethical practices like brigading, intimidation and doxxing daily. Can you imagine the uproar if t_d took part in this type of activity that these leftwing subs are? They would be banned instantly.</p>

<p>I dont know why these other subs feel so threated by a right wing community on reddit so much that they need to engage in these types of activities to attempt to ban t_d</p>

<p>Nice projection. R/conservative had a mod post a few weeks ago about how their sub is not for debate. It&#39;s for conservatives only and they ban you for dissent. T_D has been that way since the beginning. If their ideas are objectively right, why do they need to hide from opposing ideas?   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>and here is a perfect example.</p>

<p>Objecting to illegal immigration doesn&#39;t make you a racist.  Uncontrolled immigration with the introduction of a mass influx of low skilled immigrants can have harmful effects including depressed wages, increased crime, and higher utilization of social services (requiring higher taxes).</p>

<p>Recognizing that unbalanced &quot;free trade&quot; agreements and currency manipulation resulting in dumping can have economic consequences. That doesn&#39;t make you a dictator.</p>

<p>Recognizing that some religions might have more violence associated with it from others, doesn&#39;t make you a bigot either.</p>

<p>France, Sweden, Germany and many European nations are experiencing the negative consequences of uncontrolled immigration.  If you think these type issues are exclusively a US problem you&#39;re completely mistaken.</p>

<p>David Brock is one of the conduits and runs several NGO  (ShareBlue, MediaMatters) involved in a variety of activities including online astroturf targeted an large social media plaforms including Reddit.
