    <div class="md"><p>Casting JB is okay but is more about the media circus and lasting obsession with the case that followed </p>

<p>I also recommend “The Case of: JonBenet Ramsey” aired in 2016. There’s a lot of iffiness about a lot of it but the forensics are combed over in detail by world-renowned experts Werner Spitz and Dr Henry Lee and they come to some very solid conclusions.</p>

<p>To me after following the case for years I think there’s no doubt it was a coverup by the parents (that ransom note tho, come the fuck onnn), it’s just a matter of who did it and whether it was intentional. As far as general theory goes what sold me on the “Burke did it” angle was his bizarre interview with the ch</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you like reading, there&#39;s a really good book by Joyce Carol Oates called My Sister, My Love, published in 2008. It&#39;s a fictionalized version of the JBR story but it&#39;s what got me interested in the case. She writes it from the brother&#39;s POV. At that time I&#39;d never considered the brother did it, and it really wasn&#39;t a popular theory in 2008 (afaik) but she did a damn good job convincing me it was him, and I&#39;ve thought so ever since. Imo, it was an absolutely  brilliant idea, and she does an amazing job, she sounds 100% believable as a kid on the periphery of a narcissistic, self absorbed family.</p>
