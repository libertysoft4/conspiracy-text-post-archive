    <div class="md"><p>Yes it does. You want equality of outcome, not equality of opportunity. There is no way around the negatives when you&#39;re trying to impose equality of outcome because it is unnatural and phony.</p>

<p>You want tyranny imposed to make everything cost the same proportion to all people, but as someone said already, that kills the incentive to create things (if things aren&#39;t sold for what they are worth) and efficiently allocate resources based on market signals (prices).</p>

<p>All these &quot;what if the world was equal and full of love&quot; nursery ideas are all one big joke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a big if. Who is suddenly going to have global dictatorship power with exact knowledge of everything and everybody&#39;s finances and be able to apply this scheme without massive backlash. Whilst I don&#39;t think we live in utopia I believe a large part of our current systems rely on human nature. It&#39;s not actually fair that hard working or save oriented person suddenly has to pay more than reckless lazy others. Application of proposal is lacking, I think it could possibly be flawed or lead to worse outcomes than initial thoughts. It doesn&#39;t solve any fairness issues except maybe for the extreme ends of rich/poor. Relative wealth is quite a spectrum and not so easy to quantify or apply a simplistic notion to. We have a system in the world right now where products and services have unequal value around the world. This fuels global inequality and the third world/first world trade issues and free movement of people problems. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sure there are holes, but wouldn&#39;t the idea create instant equality? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Short answer: no, this idea alone wouldn&#39;t work in our current society. You would need to take much more drastic steps to create total economic equality.</p>

<p>Long answer: It&#39;s too broad, because there are vast differences in costs between things wealthy people buy and things poor people buy.</p>

<p>For example, for most people their biggest expense as a percentage of their income is their rent or mortgage. For a very poor person, that might be a three-figure monthly bill that consumes more than half of their income; for a fairly wealthy person in a big city it&#39;s four or five figures and a smaller percentage of their income.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s say that your system decides the appropriate percentage of income to spend on rent is 35%. That means that the rich person is now paying way more for their house than it&#39;s actually worth, while the poor person is paying much less than it&#39;s worth. Of course, that&#39;s the whole idea, and maybe your system has a way to redistribute the wealthy homeowner&#39;s payment to make up the difference of all the people losing money renting to poor people, but there&#39;s another problem: in your system, at least as stated, there&#39;s nothing to stop a poor person from renting a very expensive house. They&#39;ll pay the same rent no matter what (35% of their income), so why live in a $600/month apartment when they could be in a $6000/month luxury home?</p>

<p>Note that this same problem will crop up with almost any utility or expenditure you can think of: if the &#39;luxury&#39; option costs the same as the &#39;budget&#39; option, there&#39;s no incentive to be cheap.</p>

<p>This is unworkable, because now your rich guy who overpays can only cover the cost of one poor person that underpays, and rich people are vastly outnumbered by poor people. Presumably you&#39;ve enacted laws that landowners can&#39;t discriminate based on income, so your government program goes bankrupt.</p>

<p>You can try to fix this by mandating that poor people are only allowed to purchase things &#39;within their means&#39;, but that&#39;s arguably worse than the system we have now, because you&#39;re essentially telling people that they&#39;re not allowed to purchase extravagances for themselves by law. (&#39;Sorry, with your income you don&#39;t qualify for this Thanksgiving turkey. You can have these hot dogs.&#39;) You&#39;re also making it much harder to save money; if someone wants to save some cash by cheaping out on a bunch of their expenditures, that&#39;s no longer an option.</p>

<p>This is ignoring some other issues, like what counts as income, and whether people have any extra left over to invest, and yada yada yada.</p>
