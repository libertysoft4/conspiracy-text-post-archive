<p>The name of the first man the god of the Bible created, was Adam.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Adam</strong>. It could be ultimately derived from Hebrew אדם (&#39;adam) meaning &quot;<strong>to be red</strong>&quot;, referring to the ruddy colour of human skin, or from Akkadian adamu meaning &quot;to make&quot;. According to Genesis in the Old Testament Adam was created from the earth by God (there is a word play on Hebrew אֲדָמָה (&#39;adamah) &quot;earth&quot;).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Adam means to be red and is a play on the word &quot;Earth&quot;. So.... The red Earth???</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/meaning-of-adamah.html">https://www.gotquestions.org/meaning-of-adamah.html</a></p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Question: &quot;What is the meaning of the Hebrew word adamah?&quot;  </p>

<p>Answer: The Hebrew word adamah means “land,” “ground,” or “soil.” The New American Standard Bible translates adamah as “ground” 64 times and “land” or “lands” 114 times. Related to adamah is the word adam, which means “man” or “mankind.” Of course, adam is also used as the proper name of the first man, Adam.  </p>

<p>Most scholars believe that the words adamah, Adam, and Edom stem from a root word with the basic meaning of “red.” The word adamah could then be more literally translated “red ground,” and the name Adam, could be said to mean “red man” or “man from the red dirt.”  </p>

<p>Reading from Genesis 2, we notice several plays on the word adamah:  </p>

<p>“There was no one to work the ground, but streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground [adamah]. Then the Lord God formed a man [adam] from the dust of the ground [adamah] and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man [adam] became a living being. Now the Lord God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man [adam] he had formed. The Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground [adamah]” (verses 5–14).  </p>

<p>Then in Genesis 2:15, we read this:  </p>

<p>“The Lord God took the man [adam] and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.”  </p>

<p>So, not only is Adam formed from adamah and named after adamah, but he is now assigned with working the adamah and cultivating the plants that come from it.  </p>

<p>After Adam’s sin, God curses both Adam and adamah:  </p>

<p>“To Adam [adam] he said . . . ‘Cursed is the ground [adamah] because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life’” (Genesis 3:17).  </p>

<p>Then God said that the curse on Adam will result in his return to adamah:  </p>

<p>“By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground [adamah], since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return” (Genesis 3:19).  </p>

<p>The Bible teaches that mankind has an intimate relationship with the earth (see Genesis 2:5). Adam was formed from the earth, was responsible for the curse brought upon the earth, is tasked with cultivating the earth, eats the produce of the earth, and at death returns to the earth. As children of Adam, we are earthly—we have a connection with adamah. And that is why we must be born again (John 3:3). Only a relationship with Jesus Christ can break us free from the Adamic curse and the Adamic fate. The first Adam subjected us to a curse; but Jesus, the “Last Adam” (1 Corinthians 15:45), gives us a blessing. Contrasting Adam with Christ, Paul writes, “The first man was of the dust of the earth; the second man is of heaven” (1 Corinthians 15:47).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>So it doesn&#39;t specifically mean &quot;Earth&quot;, it just means ground or land. So this god made Adam from &quot;red dirt&quot; and he was a &quot;red man from the red dirt&quot;. Considering everyone associated with the Edomites, the &quot;Red people&quot;  (Romans, America, Germany, Russia) have been very war like and conquerors and Mars is the &quot;red planet&quot; and the &quot;god of war&quot;, I think there might be a connection here. No wonder I&#39;ve been so focused on this &quot;red&quot; people thing. Holy shit.</p>

<p>Yes, &quot;evidence&quot; of how a large and very significant/ powerful part of modern humanity (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) came to evolve the religious/ social/ &quot;moral&quot; and political structures that govern our daily lives -- if nothing else.</p>

<p>The Bible also gives valuable evidence in the study of comparative mythologies among other, far-flung and seemingly unrelated cultures that either preceded the Biblical narrative or developed in parallel times in distant geographic regions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having read all of these post of yours I think you have already convinced yourself of this and no real discussion can take place due to that.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I think the concept is interesting but you very clearly interpret everything to match your theory.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>In this very post you say;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Adam. It could be ultimately derived from Hebrew אדם (&#39;adam) meaning &quot;to be red&quot;, referring to the ruddy colour of human skin, or from Akkadian adamu meaning &quot;to make&quot;. According to Genesis in the Old Testament Adam was created from the earth by God (there is a word play on Hebrew אֲדָמָה (&#39;adamah) &quot;earth&quot;).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but you completely go on to ignore the possible Akkadian meaning, which also matches the creation story of Adam both being made, and him creating mankind. This is also a common creation myth in many cultures, many of which came before the Hewbrews. Adamu is the first provable useage of the word Adam as a name. The Akkadians for a time also ruled the Sumerians whos creation myth if almost identical to the Hebrews. There is also the arabic term &#39;adim&#39; which roughly translates to &#39;skin of the earth&#39;, also matching the creation story.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>You also largely ignore the possibity that the &#39;to be red&#39; is both a fair descripter of the skin colour of the people of the region and actually matches the colour of much of the dirt in the region. It is common story thread in many creation myths from the region that people are created from dust or the earth, with the colour of the earth dictating skin colour.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Yours is a very interesing theory, but I think you may be looking for something that isn&#39;t there. You often don&#39;t back up you conclusions with anything other that your thoughts, like the Trump and Putin being time travelers trying to prevent WW3</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t mind rudeness if you&#39;ll at least engage with me. I just don&#39;t like when all someone wants to do is hurl insults and wont even take the take to try to figure out why I think what I think. I know a lot of the shit I post seems nuts but I can help people understand it if they&#39;re willing to ask. A lot of it is interconnected with everything else I am working on so one piece may seem insignificant, like Adam&#39;s name meaning red, but combined with everything, it creates the whole puzzle. </p>

<p>Why can&#39;t it mean both? He was made, there&#39;s no getting around that. I know it may seem like I am making loose connections but I have been doing this for a few months and every time I make these connections, they are no coincidence and are always confirmed to me in the coming days by some crazy syncrinicity. I stumbled upon the Roman god Vulcan and his connections to Yahweh while I was reading about Neptune and then not even a week later they discover the real planet Vulcan. Things like this have been happening to me almost daily now.</p>
