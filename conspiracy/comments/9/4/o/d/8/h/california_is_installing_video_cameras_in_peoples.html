<p>However, you raise some interesting thoughts with your proposal. Regardless, this is not going to be easy. Tough decisions, strong commitment and strict personal discipline will be necessary to ensure survival and security, speaking theoretically...</p>

<p>most “scary” programs start out as something innocent sounding, give it 10 years and having these will give you a discount on your property taxes ( in the same way that Edison put “smart meters” into homes in exchange for a $200 rebate on a single power bill, except the smart meters are capable of reading a “inductive load” on your power system correctly which now makes your air conditioner cost about 10x as expensive to run as it did with the traditional meter ) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you compare the “spotlight” to the “floodlight” you should be able to see which one is intended as their outdoor use product, </p>

<p>Yes you can use the spotlight outdoors but you will notice that the spotlight has to be plugged into a wall via a plugpack, so you need a outdoor PowerPoint for it ( which also means someone can just unplug it ) </p>

<p>Meanwhile the floodlight model is designed to be wired into the houses mains power and does not come with a wall plug. </p>

<p>not sure why you think people wouldnt, when thats how its shown everywhere on their website and marketing. </p>

<p>is there somewhere in this program from the govt that says the cameras are inside, or is it all based on you thinking the spotlight is an indoor camera?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are BADLY confused OP, and I&#39;m surprised this got as much as one upvote. </p>

<p>These cameras are provided by a private company. They are not government owned in any way. None of the feeds are shared with any police departments. Not sure where you got all this misinformation.</p>

<p>RING ( a private company) provides cameras on your doorstep that are activated by your doorbell being rung or someone stepping on your porch, which then sends this video to your smartphone. It comes with a mic and a speaker so you can talk to the person on your doorstep no matter where you are. It can also be equipped to activate sirens and alarm noises and lights. The feed goes to your RING web account and nowhere else.</p>

<p>There is an app called &quot;neighbors&quot; on ring that allows CITIZENS to post video that THEY recorded to a public website to alert neighbors to suspicious people in the neighborhood, that police can then view.</p>

<p>The only tie in with the &#39;government&#39; is that these cities can set up corporate accounts, which would then give residents of these cities a discount SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO PURCHASE these systems.</p>

<p>This already happened in LA over 2 years ago, where RING GAVE AWAY 500 of these cameras as part of a pilot program. It reduced burglaries in high crime areas on Willshire BLVD by 55%.</p>

<p><a href="http://abc7.com/news/lapd-pilot-program-uses-smartphone-app-to-reduce-burglaries/1262052/">http://abc7.com/news/lapd-pilot-program-uses-smartphone-app-to-reduce-burglaries/1262052/</a></p>

<p>You are really dumb if you think any city police department has the time or manpower to monitor private cameras on people&#39;s doorsteps 24 hours a day. They barely have enough people to monitor official municipal surveillance cameras. </p>

<p>Could they be hacked? sure but so can the webcam on your laptop (waive to the FBI-they are watching you, because you are so important you know. Hope you have black tape over the lense, and dont forget your foil hat- they can steal your thoughts too.)</p>

<p>Could police subpeona records to have footage from these cameras released if a crime did occur? Yes. But they can already do that with any surveillance camera, which in most cases would help YOU as the property owner. (which I have a sneaking suspicion somehow that you are not) </p>

<p>Form another article :
 &quot;Law enforcement can put out requests for information, but must have a case number when doing so. Law enforcement won’t have direct access to people’s devices, videos, or data.&quot;</p>

<p>Nothing new here, no conspiracy at all. This has absolutely nothing to do with the 4th ammendment. This is about people using smart technology to secure their homes. Get your house broken into while your away and you would wish you had one. Most home invasions occur not because someone kicks in a door, but because someone opens a door to let the person in under false pretense. It would be really handy to be able to talk to people without opening the door and this would save lives, prevent rapes, robberies and home invasions.</p>

<p>If anything this technology should be being promoted on a conspiracy sub for the more paranoid amongst us, not villified. This is putting the power of surveillance into the common person&#39;s hands.</p>

<p>&quot;California&quot; isnt installing anything, a private company called RING is. And they arent &quot;in&quot; homes they are on doorsteps. This has less to do with &quot;pubic safety&quot; than it does personal private safety. Nothing you have written here is really accurate.</p>

<p>Sorry to rain on your orwellian prophecy parade, but this isnt at all what George was warning us about. This is just good solid preventative measures that can help people in higher crime areas secure their homes and protect valuables and family members within those homes.</p>

<p>If the government was providing a discount to people for them to buy it from ring then this would be different , but above I have linked a post from the acting mayor of Palmdale who is looking into purchasing these directly, in another post when pressed me mentions that one can &quot;opt out&quot; of the city gaining automatic access to the feeds. </p>

<p>In the same way that T-Mobile buys shittons of iPhones and then installs their own software on them this is the city of Palmdale buying a lot of these devices and then using that purchasing power to gain access to the feeds . </p>

<p>While I would like to believe that the people running the city have our best interests at heart I have found that at least out here in the strong red parts of California this is not the case  </p>

<p>is this what you&#39;re referring to? The article says the PD is offering $100 off ring products. There is hardly anything nefarious with that, unless there wasn&#39;t a choice- which there seems to be. </p>
