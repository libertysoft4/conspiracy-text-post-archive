        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure my connection has been completely cut off from the internet at-large and is being mostly filtered... If anyone can prove me wrong or talk about things which would signal that i&#39;m wrong, i would appreceiate it...</p>

<p>I am being fully gangstalked and targeted using the bleeding edge technology.. At least further than most TIs i have heard on youtube (and i&#39;ve seen like 300-400 videos of the most legit)</p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you a couple questions that can help me..</p>

<p>1). How did Chuck Langenberg (ChuckInVancouver or somethin like that) die? How, specifically? Did he commit suicide? Because i am in a spot very similar to him.. I am not irrate in any way when i typed this entire message.. I have the gadgets on my roof that sound like squirells but they ARENT.. They run around irradically as if to say it isnt a legit animal.. In circles, etc.. It seems like a gadget, could be a prjection of some sort.. Possibly sound projection.. But it sounds EXACTLY like a robot on the roof making an ALMOST EXACT replica of the sounds, but it sounds artificial, like a robotic device.. The acoustics are almost EXACTLY the same.. except it does sound a bit off..</p>

<p>I have what sounds like helicopters over my house about 8 hours of the day.. Sometimes it sounds like they bring it down right close to my roof.. Its a really disinct sub-sonic rumble.. It still shakes the windows.. I havent heard dogs bark at it yet, because they just got done only doing it at night and i have only been in my room when they did it, but a couple times i went outside while it was happening and heard helicopters fly off.. it was night so i didnt see them.. I actually think its a mixture of subsonic &quot;weapons&quot; and helicopters.. because i go out of my room and hear helicopters.. But the subsonic rumble is gone, which i recognize from mastering and editing un-normalized audio... When im in my room they do strange things with this sub-sonic weapon.. It sometimes sounds as if about 400 lbs has suddenly been dropped on my roof (i live in a 1 story sears type house from the 60&#39;s (real shoddy)... But that cant be the case.. It doesnt sound like that... It is definately a case where the sound waves hit the roof before anything else.. and i doubt right now that there is anything else causing that......</p>

<p>I dont have time for a 2) right now.. but i&#39;ll post later....</p>

<p>BTW: This is not &quot;Doom Porn&quot; as people like some really strong TI&#39;s have said (I promised not to talk about them)..... There are a handful of really strong TIs.. most of them black dudes, some white, some Jewish.. I respect those dudes to the utmost and wish we could get in touch, but i understand why... What those people need to understand is that there needs to be some amount of TI&#39;s that do a certain kind of underwork.. It&#39;s like being a detective... We all need to come together on this and the types of TI&#39;s which are already healthy and strong dont seem to always understand this.. They claim that to just ignore the shit is the answer..</p>

<p>No its not.. It isnt the only answer, unless you enjoy just sitting around all day happy about your health.. You get no pussy, or if youre gay white guy you get no dick.. You basically get no attention from females or anything like that, that a person would used to do... regularly</p>

<p>Man, ok.. im gonna cut this off pretty soon.. I just wanted to say that the Ti&#39;s that i have learned the most from were the dudes that where really wound up, looking over their shoulder all the time.. nervous guys.. Mostly black dudes that you search up of youtube with they hat somewhat sideways talking bout gangstalking... To those dudes, i&#39;m sort of like the Justin Bieber of gangstalking... </p>

<p>Man, im being stalked, but i&#39;m JB.. MAYNE.. IM JB, MAYBE.. They fuckin me up, dog...</p>

<p>BTW: Look up Project Monarch, Project Blue-Beam, Project MK-Ultra and Project Blue Beam....</p>

<p>Thank you, my friends, thank you..</p>

<p>Have a nice day</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you being targeted? Did you invent something controversial? Do you have some kind of pertinent information (not conspiracy theories from the internet either, something unique)? Are you being contacted by alien entities? Do you have a psychic ability?
Look, you&#39;re probably schizophrenic, but just out of curiosity, and to rationalize this position you&#39;re in, why would anybody spend time and resources on you? What&#39;s the point if there&#39;s nothing special about you? You&#39;re probably just some guy, just like the rest of us. Why would the government or whoever spend the money on a project like that? Unless it&#39;s all in your head. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its a long story.....</p>

<p>I DID not invent something controversial...</p>

<p>My Targeting stems from a couple places i can recall...</p>

<p>One was a Wal-Mart store (Here in USA), in Folsom..</p>

<p>There was a girl who looked like a porn actress... about 19-23 mate... Fine as a motherfuck..... She threw me off in my life, because i wasnt ready for her... I wasnt ready to fuck her etc.. And because of this, they layed the whole MK-Ultra or monarch program downb on me...</p>

<p>They now got helicopters (or what sounds like Helis and bombs and 400 lb thuds comming down om my roof...</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure most of it is sonic or sub-sonic weapons..</p>

<p>It sounds like 400 lbs just come down on your roof... But it isnt physical... It is Sonic and sub-sonic...</p>

<p>There is no doubt that if a home wi-fi network is open or even vulnerable, that than they could get into it.. EASY PEASY...</p>

<p>So secure your WI-FI networks with 2to the 3rd and whatever the fuck its called (dont remember)... DO the highest encrption..</p>

<p>Go to fucking Truecrypt.org and encrypt your fucking WI-FI connection with that...</p>

<p>Because these guys, these gangstalkers have got there way into my wi-fi and my home netwaork.. I made the mistake of not going to truecrypt.org.. DONT MAKE THE MISTAKE I DID...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have some kind of sub-sonic weapon now which can send loud (400 lbish) thuds on a 1 story, shitty, sears tract type home roof.. I&#39;m sure there are helicopters flying above (Probably police dept.)..</p>

<p>Now, for these guys that are strong through this type of things, i am not frightened.. i am just relaying facts....</p>

<p>I am a TI and they are doing this to me.. </p>

<p>Within the past 4 hours, they have sent the heli teatment on me.. Which is something that sounds like 2 helicopters circling around my roof.. one, almost landing on the roof..</p>

<p>And.. The thing i wanted to point out is that they somehow send a very strong sub-sonic rumble which sounds like about 400 lbs dropped onto a single story roof.. it ROCKS the whole roof.. But there is no physical contact before sonic contact.. Sounds a lot like a sub-woofer...</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure they have it focused into the space of a room, because when i go out of the room, i still hear the Helis but the sub-sonic rumble is gone..</p>

<p>Can anyone confirm this or back it up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just did a small segment about gangstalking on a podcast. It&#39;s real. That being said, you need proof. Gather as much evidence as you can. You need photographic proof, undeniable video evidence, and a way to keep it all safe. Get a thumb drive. Take photos and videos of everything that seems out of place. Load them on your thumb drive and keep it with you all the time. </p>

<p>In addition, post them online. Review them multiple times, and then post them. The purpose of reviewing them is to make sure you&#39;re posting the most accurate and truthful information. Look up John Lang and the Fresno PD. </p>

<p>If you are being gangstalked, you will find evidence, somewhere. If you don&#39;t find verifiable evidence, either you&#39;re missing something or you&#39;re not a TI. </p>

<p>Beyond all of this, you need to seek medical help. First, to make sure you&#39;re not suffering from any paranoid delusions so you can rule it out. Second, to make sure you&#39;re not at risk if any other health problems. That way, if &quot;something&quot; happens, you have a recent physical to prove you were healthy. See a doctor you trust, don&#39;t mention this stuff to anyone in person, and stay safe. Gather all the information you can and build a solid case. </p>

<p>Hope this helps. </p>

<p>Also,  try to figure out why you&#39;re a TI. What do you know? What did you see? </p>

<p>DM me if you have any other questions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The podcast isn&#39;t important. I just described what it is. You need to do all the other stuff. Take extra precautions, get checked out by a trusted physician (both physically and mentally) to cover your bases. Also, review your evidence and only post the most legit. Bad evidence or even so-so evidence is only going to make you look worse. Stay safe. </p>

<p>This is a video of a man having a schizophrenic episode. The things he describes sound very much like what you are describing. Even though he knows these things aren&#39;t real, he still experiences them.</p>

<p>I really think you should talk to a doctor about what you are experiencing. Try to tell them everything. Chances are good they will be able to help you, or at least get you to someone who can. I&#39;m very sorry you have to deal with this.</p>
