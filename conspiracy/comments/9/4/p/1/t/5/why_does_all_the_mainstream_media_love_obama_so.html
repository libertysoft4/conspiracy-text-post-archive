    <div class="md"><p>First of all, you can’t blame him for getting a Nobel he probably didn’t want at the time. Second of all, it’s only a couple of years later. Third, he saved the system after the crash and restored economic normalcy; if you hate the system and that normalcy then fine but don’t expect the mainstream to produce a radical critique of the status quo. Finically, he’s getting the benefit of comparison. Obama comported himself with honor and decency relative to the presidency historically - unlike the asshole we have now. </p>

Honor and decency implies truthfulness,  frankness,   upright intentions,  without fault in his day to day conduct,  considerate,  law abiding,  upholding the US Constitution,  not given to predjudice or entangling himself in racial strife, division or social unrest,  all of which has already been proven,  he was not,  and was an instigator of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s just that when you start out in the depths of a recession there&#39;s nowhere to go but up. He doesn&#39;t get credit for the most anemic recovery in U.S. history, while actively hampering the economy with his retarded policies. I voted for him twice, but I have the intellectual honesty to admit I was wrong. The economy immediately started doing better after election night, tell me, how long does &quot;Obama&#39;s economy&quot; extend into Trump&#39;s presidency, because now the economy is at all time highs with unemployment, especially for minorities who you&#39;re supposed to care about, at all time lows; did Obama just plan it out so his failed policies would only start working once he left office?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The market is based on consumer and investor confidence, those investors including institutional investors and corporations investing in themselves, which is greatly helped when there&#39;s a high level of confidence that market strangling regulations (with dubious benefits and diminishing returns in many cases, see: Clean Air Act) will be repealed and new ones not enacted, as well as federal agencies being reigned in and not allowed to act as unilateral legislative bodies run by appointed beauraucrats any longer, see: EPA.</p>

<p>Just to explain before I have someone freaking out about how I don&#39;t like &quot;The Clean Air Act&quot; (how could I not like clean air?!?), that particular regulation came with a cost to the economy of I believe ~$30b/year, while causing a net reduction of carbon dioxide emissions of 0.25%. Most of that cost wasn&#39;t to the companies by the way, it was passed on to the already struggling customers. One of many of Obama&#39;s record setting number of regulations he put in place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a new take re: the OP&#39;s premise. Relative to the presidency historically, what I wrote is just objectively true. He&#39;s in the norm, more or less. Did he make some of the mistakes every politician does? Sure. Is it reasonable to believe his policies were terrible? Sure, it&#39;s reasonable to hate his policies, though I don&#39;t. If you think Obama instigated social unrest, perhaps you should have a look at the presidencies of Johnson, Nixon, Hoover, Lincoln, Roosevelt, etc. Any reasonable person will say that, like him or not, disagree with him or not, he was no worse than average. Now, was he a good or great president? I&#39;ve no idea at the moment.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Took money? You mean he was personally bribed? It’s difficult to credit your comment unless I’m misunderstanding it. He presided over the process of recovery. I would agree that there is a question of whether the bailout was good. Maybe it wasn’t. But there is no evidence he did it for personal gain. More likely, Obama was just a very mainstream moderate in terms of economics. It’s legitimate to criticize what he did but he WAS president during the process of economic recovery whether or not you believe that recovery was handled well or not in terms of policy. </p>

<p>His Nobel Peace Prize whether or not he threw his name on the ballot it set him up to be a media darling for 8 years. Exact opposite coverage of the current administration. 90% positive. Everything he did was great. Couldn’t do no wrong. Fucking Barack Midas Obama. </p>

You could say it was a result of early (overly) rosy perceptions of him. That’s true and fair enough as a critique. He saved the economic situation for the establishment in as much as any president can take credit for general economic conditions while they are in office. </p>

<p>Hahahaha!</p>

<p><em>When the National Debt increases by $7.9 trillion, to subsidize corporate and militarily industries, under your watch is not restoring economic normalcy, it is robbing the country of its economic future.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obama comported himself with honor and decency relative to the presidency historically</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hahahaha!</p>

<p><em>Obama prosecuted journalists and whistleblowers, increased the country&#39;s ability to spy on American citizens,  heralded the policies set by the Bush administration, provided material support to actual jihadists, inflamed relationships with Russia by subverting democracy in the Ukraine, while committing war crimes with an expanded drone program.  Obama knows nothing of honor or decency</em></p>

<p>Hahahaha, thanks for the laugh...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I know the left and right meet &#39;round the bend. I&#39;m not saying you don&#39;t have a case but that what you describe as robbery and criminality is mainstream behavior of presidents and likely an institutional problem/effect. Obama didn&#39;t come in and with malevolent intentions like the current president, rather, he took advice from the institutional representatives advising him. The giant aircraft carrier that is America was kept rolling along as opposed to being turned to some other dark course. Supporters of Obama could argue that he altered the course a little, as far as the difficulty of turning such a giant structure is. Others can argue he didn&#39;t have the will or integrity to change the system.  </p>

<p>I totally get that Cheney had a lot of pull behind the scenes, but this is the same dynamic that was present with Bush Sr. and Reagan.  Doesn&#39;t mean that Reagan or Bush Jr weren&#39;t alphas.  Just look at how they talk to &quot;normal&quot; people.  Totally different than Obama.</p>

I really don&#39;t get the impression that the media sees him as one of the best ones ever. Certainly one of the most charismatic and dignified, but Obama had plenty of criticism.</p>

they ALL WERE SHITTING ON BERNIE SANDERS.
And even he was only slightly left wing (American spectrum)

This is what happens when the corporate media gives the nation
a &quot;politics lesson&quot;. They&#39;re lying through their asses.</p>

<p>People need to snap out of this bullshit identity politics propaganda.
Being an SJW does not make you left wing. It just makes you a brainwashed moron.
Also, just because Obama was leftish on social issues (LGBT rights, pro-choice on abortion) doesn&#39;t make him left wing. His economics were very right wing like Clinton&#39;s
but not as much as Romney, Bush, Rubio, Cruz, etc. </p>

<p>Modern Dems and Repubs are shitty corporatist shills.
There has not been a moderate right, centrist or left wing president for decades.</p>

<p>Fox promotes Repubs, CNN promotes Dems. Status quo business as usual.
I don&#39;t believe Trump is playing 4D chess because nothing has significantly changed. Elites are still screwing us over like they&#39;ve done for years.</p>

<p>People want change, and most outlets are marketing themselves as progressive or whatever, but they&#39;re just corporate shills with an LGBT flavor or whatever gimmicky bullshit. I&#39;m left wing economically and socially non-authoritarian, and I&#39;ve never been an SJW in my life. Corporate media is manipulative bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People have been brainwashed by the corporately owned media to think Obama is so cool and progressive......uh he&#39;s a wallstreet warmonger shill just like the rest. It is trickle down NEOliberal bullshit economics. Both parties do not care about workers or ethical small/medium businesses. They only care about the scummy tax-dodging, worker exploiting, big corporations, banksters and other oligarchs. Modern Dems and Repubs are shills. Bernie (initially an independent) was an exception I feel, as he was an FDR style European centrist (or slightly left wing on the American spectrum). The corporate media&#39;s spectrum however, is utter bullshit, pretending wallstreet warmongers Clinton and Obama are left wing lol.</p>

<p>But consider most of Europe is also NEOliberal (just not as far right as America which is the NWO battleground)
and also consider he got rigged against and all corporate media smeared him 24/7 while obsessing over crazy Trump and promoting crazy Hillary. Both can kiss my ass, I see no evidence of Trump being anti-establishment so far, and Clinton is obviously a wallstreet shill too.</p>

<p>Money in politics is partially to blame for all this crap. Corporate/banking conflicts of interest in government
lead to shill politicians promoting shitty policies and the monopoly corporate media saying it&#39;s good shit (muh lib vs con when again, both parties are just two shades of far right corporatist economics).</p>

<p>But because they talk about those &quot;far right NAZIS!!!&quot;
they try to make themselves look normal. The establishment is in fact extremist.
Extreme right economics + authoritarian social issues (ahem NSA spy state).
The Nazis were extremely authoritarian, but that shouldn&#39;t put the current establishment off the hook.
Corporatism leads to NWO fascism.</p>

<p>We need money out of politics and then we&#39;ll start to get
center left, centrist, moderate right politicians instead of extreme right NEOlib trickle down shills and NEOcon warmongers (Dems and Repubs are both of these simultaneously).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a progressive and Obama definitely continued the neoliberal policies. As I&#39;m noticing with my local democrat officials, the rhetoric and the actions differ a lot. He even acknowledged and praised the death of a guy in my community who was known for being a hotheaded criminal. He supported my mayor, who was an intern at the white house during his presidency, who now receives his largest local donations from RNC donors(Spanos family) and Bohemian Grove attendees (Greenwald Fritz Grupe Jr). Obama is a token black guy that can be used to soften the blow of the agenda being pushed, he wouldn&#39;t have received his position otherwise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t really elaborate in the space of a reddit post.  </p>

<p>CIA as MSM:  There are scores of books about the CIA and their nefariousness (which includes Operation Mockingbird), this is well trod ground.  If you prefer movies, Everything is a Rich Man&#39;s trick is a great primer on the CIA (in the context of the Kennedy assassination).</p>

<p>CIA as Obama:  This is a bit more dot connecting, though I think somewhat accepted among conspiracy folks.  With a firm understanding of the CIA, the dots are not difficult to connect.  I see the reductionist reply to the SA = Citibank = CIA, so I won&#39;t get into all the dots.  I don&#39;t want one dot to tank the whole concept.</p>

<p>If both are new concepts, start with the CIA in general.  Obama is a flower that grew from the CIA&#39;s garden.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Media job isn&#39;t to attack, but to present current events, and of course, he was one of them. Government is a representation of us, and that makes him one of us. We act like the Government is this utterly detached thing that is meant to keep us down. If the Trump Administration has shown me anything, it is that clearly that isn&#39;t true. Look at the shift from 2015 to now in the political climate, and how many people are watching. Thinking that they are utterly detached, and do not answer to us is the first step in allowing them to do so. </p>

<p>Deep state candidates are of late identity politics candidates because the belief is that the masses are stupid &amp; will accept these candidates with less opposition. H Clinton proved that doesn&#39;t exactly work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He had a certain charisma.  But let&#39;s be honest, he was the first black President, a concept that a lot of people are invested in.  The media loves to push a highly integrated image of America that I think is less true on the ground and in everyday reality, and Obama was an ideal character for this fictional drama.  Don&#39;t forget that he was also more than willing to indulge in a certain amount of pop culture identity and accessibility, which the media loved.</p>

<p>He was also the follow-on to Bush who had something of a hostile relationship with the press, so a President who is press-friendly is going to get more positive coverage, above and beyond the obvious ideological preferences.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also sure you can overplay Obama&#39;s popularity, especially among left-wing Democrats.  Many were disappointed that his policies were oddly misaligned with the progressive vision pushed in the campaign.  This ultimately led to the Sanders campaign.  If Obama had managed to keep the party 100% unified, Hillary&#39;s chances would have probably improved enough to win the Presidency.</p>

<p>Of course, that&#39;s not how it went down.</p>

<p>Now we have someone who is not well spoken, not anywhere near as intelligent or self-aware, and, quite obviously unstable.</p>
