        <h3 class="title">In defense of Sarah Jeong, the New York Times and other MSM outlets have set an extremely dangerous precedent: Anti-White Racism Does Not Exist.</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-08-03 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/I_1F30FP135.html">I_1F30FP135</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yesterday, I was astonished to see the New York Times defending their new hire for their editorialist board, Sarah Jeong, who had expressed a deep-rooted hate for white people in a series of (now deleted) tweets from 2014- 2015. <a href="https://www.nytco.com/statements-in-response-to-criticism-of-the-hiring-of-sarah-jeong/">Their statement</a>, which does not actually address the tweets themselves, can be found here. (Their main argument is that Sarah Joung is in the right because her tweets are jokes and were defence against online trolls)</p>

<p>Take a look for yourself and decide whether these count as racist and whether you think this person should be writing for the NYT (Remember that these were posted after she graduated from Harvard:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.fo/BmBJ0#selection-3923.1-3923.93">-”White people have stopped breeding. You&#39;ll all go extinct soon.  This was my plan all along.”</a> (2014)<br/>
-<a href="https://archive.fo/byEMf#selection-3519.0-3519.107">”Dumbass fucking white people marking up the internet with their opinions like dogs pissing on fire hydrants”</a> (2014)<br/>
-<a href="https://archive.fo/yXccF#selection-3519.0-3519.140">”Are white people genetically predisposed to burn faster in the sun, thus logically being only fit to live underground like groveling goblins”</a> (2014) .<br/>
-<a href="https://archive.fo/3JXbr#selection-6417.0-6483.17">”#CancelWhitePeople”</a> (2014) .<br/>
-<a href="https://archive.fo/QyWKK#selection-3519.0-3519.79">”oh man it&#39;s kind of sick how much joy I get out of being cruel to old white men”</a> (2014) .<br/>
-<a href="https://archive.fo/HTSXh#selection-7153.0-7153.53">1) “white men are bullshit 2) no one cares about women”</a> (2014)</p>

<p>What happened next was a blatant attempt by the MSM to spin the mass outrage coming from all groups as an attack by right-wing trolls to get Sarah Jeong fired for no reason.</p>

<p>Within hours of the NYTs posting their statement, a swarm of articles from MSM outlets rushed to defend Sarah Joung and portray her as a victim of a harassment campaign. The majority of these articles either did not reference the actually horrifically racist tweets, or tried to push the idea that anti-white supremacy does not exist. The more left-leaning outlets even tried to spin the controversy as an attack by the alt-right. </p>

<p>Additionally, in the midst of the fracturing of the MSM over this issue, prominent leftist and feminist journalists expressed mass support for Sarah Jeong while completely disregarding the actual racist tweets themselves.</p>

<p>Whether or not you agree with the political aspects of this controversy, and regardless of your opinion on whether or not Sarah Joung should be fired, it is important to understand the precedent being set by the NYT and all the other outlets that defended Sarah Jeong:
-You can’t be racist if you&#39;re white
-It is ok to be racist to others if get hate messages on the internet</p>

<p>***It is also important to note Reddit’s overwhelming disapproval of Sarah Joung and the NYT’s defense of her. The first post to r/news about this was removed in mere hours after garnering thousands of upvotes. The second post with 32,000 upvotes, and which has currently been gilded 17 times, was also locked within hours. Countless comments have been removed. It is obvious that the majority of the internet does not think Sarah Joung should be working for the NYTs, but multiple articles are claiming this is a minority group.  </p>

<p>Wikipedia has taken adown any reference to these tweets. The page is currently locked.</p>

<p>REMEMBER, this has nothing to do whether you lean left or right. In my opinion, this was the most blatant attempt I have seen of the MSM attempting to push their narrative and is setting an extremely dangerous precedent. WE CANNOT LET THIS GO</p>

<p>If we do nothing, the MSM will pretend none of this ever happened, and an open racist will be writing opinion pieces for the New York Times. I urge you all to familiarize yourselves with Sarah Joung’s tweets, and analyze how Google search results are portraying this incident.</p>

That means no matter what I’m willing to bet she won’t be fired. Which is fine. I’m a conservative and I detest the idea of boycotts or whatever else people come up with to protest businesses. If the NYT want to hire her, fine. Let them keep digging their own grave. Newspapers are on their last lifeline. </p>

<p>In context? No. It&#39;s very clear that she wasn&#39;t being racist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And she didn’t do anything wrong. And it’s ok to fight back against hate with more hate. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean, this is 100% subjective. I&#39;m not sure what it has to do with anything though. Should she not have a job now because 4 years ago she said &#39;offensive&#39; things on twitter?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the media attention is all about some bad jokes she made in retaliation.</p>

<p>I mean, no - it&#39;s a clear as fucking day narrative being pushed...</p>

<p>Aaand here it is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And there’s no narrative that white people men especially are evil and need to be subservient to any minority because we “owe them”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The narrative that this &quot;narrative&quot; exists is what&#39;s being pushed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>subservient to any minority because we “owe them”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Y&#39;know I&#39;d wonder who would most profit from this narrative being pushed? The same people that have been trawling tweets from 10 years ago on other people who dared not agree with dear leader?</p>

<p>Without evidence.</p>

<p>All I have seen is a dozen or so absolutely horrific and racist tweets posted by her and 2 tweets from censored (could be her account for all we know) accounts.  Why in the ever loving fuck could you accept that as a defense?  How?  Just...  </p>

<p>I dont know if I would call this &#39;Racial division&#39; tactic (which I agree exists) a MSM one. I think its a political one. For one, because NONmainstream info sources are much more racially focused on difference and separation(stormfront, breitbart), and 2 because I think the political teams have staked out different sides just to cloak the fact that they are in it for self enrichment and entrenchment of power</p>

<p>An astounding <em>minority</em> of women &quot;fought for&quot; the vote.  It was legislation proposed, driven, and voted upon by men that resulted in women having the vote.  <strong>Most</strong> women didn&#39;t want the responsibility, and many campaigned against it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m meaning like those organized boycotts. If you don’t want to shop at or buy a certain companies product because of a decision they have made that’s fine. But when it becomes like a rallying cry I become disconnected. For example, Chick-Fil-A. If people don’t like the fact they are a Christian based and operated business then they don’t have to go there.  But when so called leaders call for a nation wide boycott against them because of what they stand for then they lose me. I have no problem with people individually choosing not to go to Chick-fil-a if they are honestly bothered by something. Just the idea of organized boycotts seem like a pointless gesture. It’s that group think mentally that bugs me. </p>

<p>You shouldn&#39;t be. That&#39;s how the market is used to affect change in lieu of government regulation. Like right now, people should be boycotting Facebook (and others). That&#39;s a great solution to the problem of data mining and mass surveillance, and it&#39;s the conservative solution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conservative solution would not be requesting further regulation. Conservative is for smaller government. Boycotts are fine, but we dont need further government intervention. Its the free market. The boycott is there to send a message to that company that they will change or consumers will go elsewhere. Government regulations will only stifle innovation and investment. As for the facebook boycott... I think you might find FB is just a part of the government&#39;s surveillance network anyway. Look at the DARPA lifelog / facebook link. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Paul Mooney is hilarious, but of course he&#39;s racist, because he groups people and ascribes negative qualities to them according to race.  His explanation was a little silly, saying he couldn&#39;t be racist because he wasn&#39;t actively oppressing white people, giving examples of institutional racism.  The problem is that the institutions of government  now give preference to black folks, there are entire institutions geared towards punishing examples of racism, and the entire apparatus was led at the time of the interview by a black man.  Then he seems to become more racist by comparing black folks to cows, which are forever the property of a farmer, something about how a cow could never be in charge.</p>

<p>The interviewer tried to point out that young people don&#39;t see themselves connected to issues like slavery and segregation, because they&#39;re not.  Mooney and others who argue about formerly oppressed minorities not being capable of racism seem to rely on the idea that they are eternal victims who can never rise up to the level of their former oppressors, despite their own success and fame, and despite having a 2 term black president.</p>

Greenberg could not immediately be reached for comment, but in a text to the Post he denied he was working for the FBI when he met with Stone.</p>

<p>Because you&#39;re supposed to lie. Perhaps they really thought they were getting dirt on hillary. Just like Hillary used a foreign agent, Steele, to try to get dirt on trump, i.e. all is fair in love and war. Unfortunately for the Trumps, the lawyer was a Spy and worked for Feds/Fusion GPS</p>

<p>Go to any attorney forum and you will see most lawyers pissed, on all political sides, that this went down. A lawyer who represents you, isnt supposed to get raided by those who are trying to form a case against you. We&#39;d be seeing this all the time if this was the case</p>

<p>FBI is different than the military, different branches. I can&#39;t go to my Superiors and discuss taking down Mueller/Rosenstein/FBI, and so on. It has all be done legally within the rules/laws of gov. I will say that the top brass in the Military know there is a deep state and there are various fights, intelligence, counter intelligence, and so on between the various branches.</p>

<p>The FBI/CIA have bad hombres within them who work for Mossad, with China, with Cartels, launder money, and are not working for the people or for the constitution.</p>

<p>And there we have the central problem with Trump and his sycophants. No, you&#39;re not supposed to lie. No, accepting support from a foreign person/organization for a campaign is not legal. And no, Hillary did not &quot;use a foreign agent.&quot; Are you this misinformed, or are you intentionally lying?</p>

<p>Veselnitskaya wasn&#39;t the double-agent. She was trying enlist one... Seriously, that&#39;s in the first paragraph of the article.</p>

<p>Wow, is there anything the deep state is not? I mean, no matter who or what you are referring to, they are always deep state.  Is Michael Cohen a triple-secret deep state spook too? Or only when he flips?</p>

<p>You would have to ask the DOJ why they finally relented at let her attend the Prevezon hearing. Maybe they could also tell you why the DOJ settled the Prevezon case shortly after Trump fired Bharara.</p>

<p>If the deep state didn&#39;t think he had a chance, then why did they spend so many resources in getting all of these spies into the campaign?  By the end of Mueller&#39;s investigation, you&#39;ll be claiming that everyone who isn&#39;t Donald Trump is deep state. =/</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure those attorneys are more upset that Cohen referred to himself as an attorney.</p>

<p>They have been referred to as spies... But spies of the Russian government. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you were just bullshitting about being highly ranked in the military. If you were an accurate representation of the minds in the US military, I would be worried about us nuking ourselves.</p>

<p>Hilary used a British MI6 ex-British spy, and is off the hook, so as of now its legal unless she goes down. But the Trumps didnt get anything from the Deep State spies they sent to them. It was just talks and set ups. Nothing was exchanged unlike the Steele Dossier where money was exchanged with a foreign agent</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And no, Hillary did not &quot;use a foreign agent.&quot; Are you this misinformed, or are you intentionally lying?</p>

<p>She did:</p>

<p>Christopher David Steele (born 24 June 1964) is a former British intelligence officer with the Secret Intelligence Service MI6 f</p>

<p>She got her Visa fast tracked by Obama&#39;s DOJ and met before with Fusion GPS before meeting with Trump JR, and them immediately after went back to Fusion GPS. Its a 100% clear set up</p>

<p>Obviously not. They&#39;ll find some tax evasion or something on him, and he&#39;ll flip. But its not enough to take trump down. It&#39;ll just be payoffs to keep his affairs secret</p>

<p>Are you seriously unaware of the Deepstate? They killed JFK, brought in Drugs to the U.S., started the Crack epidemic in inner cities, flooded the U.S. with Coke, have started wars, coups all over the world, its a dangerous rogue part of the U.S. Gov that operates outside of law and killed JFK because he wanted to break them up</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You would have to ask the DOJ why they finally relented at let her attend the Prevezon hearing. Maybe they could also tell you why the DOJ settled the Prevezon case shortly after Trump fired Bharara.</p>

<p>Bahara got fired because when a new admin comes in, all the DA&#39;s/DOJ folks and cabinet folks get replaced with new people. Its standard M.O, Obama did the same thing when he became Prez</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sure those attorneys are more upset that Cohen referred to himself as an attorney.</p>

<p>Well he fucked up recording the convos without his clients permission, but in NY they have a law that makes it ok. They got nothing on trump via Cohen. It simply changed the game for the future because now nobody trusts their lawyers anymore or they wont put themselves in situations to be recorded</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They have been referred to as spies... But spies of the Russian government.</p>

<p>Yeas sure there are russian spies, deep state spies, double agents, all sorts of shit going. Its a never ending war we are at. Greenberg is a legit deepstate spy trying to setup trump and stone. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not</p>

<p>You should be worried that you actually believe the lying liberal media narratives. The majority of the military knows about the deep state and there are plans in place to beat them at their own game. If there is a Coup done by the Deep State, we already have plans in place to take them all out and they are massively outnumbered, plus we have the NSA on our side. But they stull used encrypted devices to skirt it all.</p>

<p>Really just look at Strzok&#39;s texts, that shows you who&#39;s side they are on, their own, and their systems of money laundering, secret banking, drug running, etc.</p>

<p>We&#39;re not going to Nuke ourselves, but there are Deepstate agents that want trump assassinated and a few attempts you&#39;re not seeing in the news or will ever hear about, already were skirted.</p>

<p>The deepstate hates you, wants you enslaved, owns the media narratives, and does not follow the constitution. That should make you really scared</p>

<p>Prevezon doesn&#39;t matter.

<p>The Trump tower meeting is nothing. There is literally Zero laws that make it illegal to meet with a foreign attorney to discuss opposition research, which in this case was sent there by FusionGPS/Deeptate.

    <div class="md"><p>I never said Steele wasn&#39;t foreign. But he wasn&#39;t hired by the DNC, FusionGPS was hired. Also, <em>hired</em>. They hired oppo research and properly reported it in their finances, as opposed to a foreign government &quot;offering&quot; dirt and the meeting not being reported.</p>

<p>Who did the DNC hire? Let&#39;s see if you can answer this one, basic, question. Who was it that was hired?</p>

<p>You&#39;re half right. Prevezon wasn&#39;t really important. It was just her cover to get into the US.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a difference between seeking out oppo research, and dirt being offered. And if this was legal or above board, why would Trump repeatedly lie about it? Seriously, if it was as unimportant as you claim it is, then why wasn&#39;t the initial response, &quot;yes we had a meeting with a Russian lawyer had offered dirt on Hillary. We didn&#39;t report this to the FBI like we were supposed to because there was no substance to it.&quot; ?</p>

<p>I know where I am. I also know how very idiotic the &quot;deep state&quot; theory is. It&#39;s a go-to for the lazy or those trying to hide the truth. Like when ancient cultures dreamed up gods to explain things they didn&#39;t understand, and those gods we&#39;re then used to control the people.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re saying that Preet was preventing the DOJ from accepting a bribe, so they had to get rid of him so they could be corrupt?</p>

<p>Who was involved in making many of those real estate &quot;deals&quot;? Cohen. He was probably the one handling all of Trump&#39;s illegal deals, not just the illegal payoffs.</p>

<p>You mean treasury admin met with the representative of the Russian central bank?! Wow, it&#39;s almost as if that may have been related to their job...</p>

<p>Ah, so you&#39;ve got the inside scoop, you know all the deets, and you&#39;re an intel pro. Got it. ;)
Getting all of your info straight from the source! ...and podcasts/YouTube &gt;.&gt;</p>

<p>Wait, so Trump is a Clinton plant, so it&#39;s all Hillary&#39;s fault he is president, so even when it turns out that he is a criminal it will still be Hillary&#39;s fault?  Lol</p>

<p>Are you seriously more concerned with what was said than what was done? Give one reason why, if Strozk&#39;s goal was to destroy/sabotage/prevent the Trump presidency, did he not leak that Trump was being investigated by the FBI?</p>

<p>Hi, are you just now joining the conversation? Have you not read the past several comments?</p>

<p>But if my only source of news is CNN, how would I have known about the Guardian story? And do you really think the SS wouldn&#39;t put out a presser to try and save face after they are embarrassed? </p>

<p>And this is why there&#39;s no point in discussing anything with you. Even if it was fact,  you&#39;d still say, &quot;but CNN said it&#39;s not true.&quot; Lol</p>

<p>I&#39;ll hit you back up in 2020 when Trump gets a second term. Until then, it&#39;s pretty obvious that you don&#39;t have the capacity to understand facts, sources, and use logic</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No that&#39;s not suppression of free speech.  An example of suppression of free speech is what happened to Ben Shapiro and the myriad of other conservative speakers, banned from college campuses after being invited. </p>

<p>President Trump for involved solely for political reasons, he knew that this was winning issue for him since the majority of Americans respect the flag and national anthem. </p>

<p>How did the government abuse it&#39;s powers?
Did Trump create a law that forces people to stand up to the national anthem? </p>

<p>The NFL is a private organization which has its own policies. Players are allowed to protest, but if they do they would receive a penalty. 
Players have a right to protest but outside the forum of the NFL. People have the right to criticize them. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re aware but the President also has the right to free speech and he has the unequivocal right to denounce people that are disrespecting our flag and national anthem. </p>

<p>I would also argue as to what these people are protesting about. Police involved shootings of black men? I bet they don&#39;t know that more white people are shot and killed by the police than black people. In fact, black and black homicide are way higher than white on black homicides. If that&#39;s the essence of their protest, than they are just deceiving people.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m working for a private cooperation and I don&#39;t like the way they run things, I can&#39;t just go and espouse my displeasure with impunity, I will most likely be fired. If that&#39;s the case did they violate my first amendment right to free speech??</p>

<p>members of the executive and congress cant call for someone to be fired from their job at the nfl.  its unamerican and more to point treasonous to the very founding principles our country was based off of, to use the office of the president to threaten someones job because they dont like their display of politcal dissent.</p>

<p>you are arguing in favor of treason and tyranny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the nfl has the right to fire anyone, they may not have the right to force someone to stand for the national anthem, and they may get sued for any reason.  the issue was never about what the nfl can or cannot do.</p>

<p>its hilarious that you seem to think thats the issue.</p>

<p>the issue is what the president and members of congress can and cannot do.  the president can not call for an nfl player to be fired over political dissent.</p>

<p>but i get it, you support treason and tyranny, and are having a hard time grappling with a defense of your position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No the NFL can&#39;t get sued, since there  policy is to stand up for the national anthem. NFL is merely adhering to its own policy.</p>

<p>No I support a tradition that has been around for centuries and respect our country and our flag. If your ever attend a  sporting event, don&#39;t stand up for the national anthem, you&#39;ll feel like a moron.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol of course the nfl can get sued, it doesnt matter what their policy is or isnt.  you can sue your employer for any reason.</p>

<p>the nfl only took action because the president made it an issue, not because their policy was broken.</p>

<p>you support the president threatening someones job over politicsl dissent.  thats very different than your personal choice to sit, stand, or kneel durring the anthem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see where you&#39;re coming from. I guess the biggest difference, for me at least, is that she is on the editorial board for TNYT. Someone tasked with that kind of responsibility, should probably not be incredibly racist. TNYT is supposed to be run by journalists, ideally people that pursue the truth whole heartedly, trying to free themselves from biases on a personal level, as well as on a professional level. A racist doesn&#39;t really meet those requirements.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s contrast that with say, Roseanne. She&#39;s a professional comedian. Her responsibility is to make people laugh by illuminating entertaining attributes of the human experience. That&#39;s almost always offensive. Roseanne can make a joke about how children with cancer need to die to improve the gene pool, and it&#39;s okay. It&#39;s a fucking joke. It doesn&#39;t have to be true. In fact, for really offensive jokes, it&#39;s better if it&#39;s not true, and incredibly hyperbolic. That&#39;s kind of how comedy works.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Roseanne should have kept her job, she made some really fucked up, racist comments on twitter, and even though she&#39;s a comedian, the context of those tweets seemed pretty serious. Giving her a pass is kind of dancing around the truth of what she was saying, of what the context of her communications appeared to reveal about her intent, which was to involve the race of someone she was criticizing as a criticism, a genuine criticism. That&#39;s not okay. Maybe a really edgy black comedian could get away with the kind of humor she was getting at, if it was done correctly, and they had a reputation of just not giving a fuck, but it&#39;s definitely not okay for Roseanne to say these things. We don&#39;t want that kind of distasteful, tact-less humor in our media. I&#39;m not an SJW, and I don&#39;t think that stance is in any way &quot;left leaning&quot;. It&#39;s just, pretty true. Some anonymous edgy meme account, with no personality attached to it, could get away with it. That&#39;s fine. Someone making a reboot of a syndicated sitcom reaching millions of viewers? Not so much.</p>

<p>ALL that said, I have <strong>more</strong> reason to come down on Sarah. What she has said was <strong>FAR WORSE</strong>, and she has a <strong>FAR MORE</strong> significant responsibility than Roseanne. </p>

<p>I hope that clears things up for you, where a moderate is coming from on this. I get your criticisms of the right. They definitely haven&#39;t thought this shit through. Ideology is driving people kind of crazy, enraging people, until they can&#39;t even see the other side of America anymore.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t make her comment not racist.

Do you think I&#39;d still have a job? She was what...25, 26 years old at the time? A Harvard graduate? I&#39;m surprised wherever she was working at the time, she wasn&#39;t fired right then. It doesn&#39;t matter if she was being a troll, she felt it was somehow acceptable to make this public. She&#39;s not a comedian. She&#39;s a journalist. If she made these comments in private, I&#39;d say fuck off, she&#39;s human. She didn&#39;t make them in private, and that reflects some deeply held racist beliefs. I&#39;m not saying she is a bad person for making the comments at all, I&#39;m saying she&#39;s racist for making the comments public and associating them with her persona, by assuming that it is in some way acceptable to make these racist comments as a journalist, publicly.</p>

<p>No, she didn&#39;t just do it immaturely, she did it unprofessionally, in a racist manner, by assuming that this would somehow be acceptable. This is not what a journalist does. Maybe by today&#39;s standards of journalism, which throws journalism as a profession completely out the window, but not what we should accept as Journalism. TNYT&#39;s acceptance and defense of this just further drives that point home.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying she hasn&#39;t, but I don&#39;t want her on TNYT&#39;s editorial board until she redeems herself. She should get fired, black listed by MSM outlets, and learn from her mistakes. 10 years of climbing back up the rungs of success. That&#39;s what needs to happen to prove she has grown as a person. </p>

If OJ&#39;s trial did go the the supreme court, that would not make saying &quot;black people are bullshit&quot; okay. In fact, OJ won the case. That&#39;s insane. That doesn&#39;t make &quot;black people bullshit&quot;. It&#39;s racist, period.</p>

<p>God fucking damn, made me giggle at least.</p>

<p>Honestly, I think it&#39;s all being a bit too overstated, and I know for a fact this is at least 50% tit for tat faux outrage, and most people haven&#39;t put half as much thought in it as you have.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in complete agreement, there&#39;s plenty of ignorance to go around, the right included, the left included. Intelligence and political ideology are not so intimately related in this instance. I&#39;m not saying there isn&#39;t tit for tat faux outrage. There always is with anything, whether the outrage is legitimate or not.</p>

<p>The reality is, she said racist, stupid, ignorant shit when she should not have, when she should have known better. That reflects her character. She should have been black listed when she made the comments. Then she&#39;s only be 6 years from redemption ;).</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry, there won&#39;t be any shortage of that, or the reverse, either. The ball will keep bouncing back and forth to and fro either side of the proverbial court. </p>

<p>She&#39;s still a fucking racist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not meant to be a moral judgement, just what I think will happen, because it has happened before.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re looking at it with our current morality. History is not like this. We don&#39;t observe the past and make moral judgement (usually) unless these people want to resurrect that kind of life style. For example, everyone can agree, almost all the greats form history were immoral and would be appalling to see in the modern era. But we remember them as the Greats for their deeds, not for their morality. If some one actually tried to resurrect the mongol Empire, we would find them evil. However, Genghis Khan is recognized as a great man. (Great in the achievement, not morality).</p>

<p>Napoleon lost his bid for dominion over Europe, but he has an entire age named after him and is regarded as one of the greatest historical figures ever. Because while he was defeated, the things he achieved in his life had lasting effects on the course of history, and the odds were so heavily stacked against him, it shouldn&#39;t of been possible, but he made it so.</p>

<p>Hitler is much in the same. A homeless man who goes from nothing, to on the verge of establishing a new world order. While he is morally bankrupt, in both his ideology and designs, no one can doubt the achievement of going from nothing, to the brink of a world order, led by him. </p>

<p>As we grow ever more distant from WW2, figures from it will be remembered as &quot;great&quot; not out of morality, but achievement. Right now there are still many who were there, and directly effected by it, it is still hot within our emotions, and the ideas Nazism created were never defeated, they died in the battlefield, but we did not watch them stumble, fail, and collapse on their own merits, much like we did Communism, and this is why they will be appealing to some.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;  I remember when I was with Special Forces. Seems a thousand centuries ago. We went into a camp to inoculate the children. We left the camp after we had inoculated the children for Polio, and this old man came running after us, and he was crying. He couldn&#39;t see. We went back there, and they had come and hacked off every inoculated arm. There they were in a pile. A pile of little arms. And I remember ... I ... I ... I cried. I wept like some grandmother. I wanted to tear my teeth out. I didn&#39;t know what I wanted to do. And I want to remember it. I never want to forget it. I never want to forget. And then I realized ... like I was shot ... like I was shot with a diamond ... a diamond bullet right through my forehead. And I thought: My God ... the genius of that. The genius. The will to do that. Perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure. And then I realized they were stronger than we. Because they could stand that these were not monsters. These were men ... trained cadres. These men who fought with their hearts, who had families, who had children, who were filled with love ... but they had the strength ... the strength ... to do that. If I had ten divisions of those men, then our troubles here would be over very quickly. You have to have men who are moral ... and at the same time who are able to utilize their primordial instincts to kill without feeling ... without passion ... without judgment ... without judgment. Because it&#39;s judgment that defeats us. &quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing that people are missing, in my opinion:</p>

<p>Who makes up the leadership of the NYT? What sorts of people have the final say in hiring someone like Jeong?</p>

<p>It seems that they are a bunch of old, White men. So why would they hire someone who despises them?</p>

<p>Its because these people do not consider themselves to be White, and in fact, history shows us that they consider White people to be their greatest enemy.</p>

<p>This is a bitter pill to swallow, but once you understand that, you can understand so much more about what has been and currently is going on in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The NYT is not the supreme court. It doesn&#39;t set precedents as per its opinions. I think it&#39;s pretty damaging to start saying everything the NYT does creates a precedent, as if they, or the MSM at large, have the authority to dictate how human beings think. I get that they have a lot of influence, but maybe we should stop saying that everything they do &quot;sets a precedent&quot;. </p>

<p>Precedent: an earlier event or action that is regarded as an example or guide to be considered in subsequent similar circumstances.</p>

<p>The NYT should not be used as an example to be considered in subsequent similar circumstances. They&#39;re regarded as a prestigious news organization, true, but I think it&#39;s high time we stop caring about what they publish and what their editors think. That&#39;s the precedent we need to set as a society. They&#39;re just not relevant anymore, or at least they really shouldn&#39;t be.</p>

<p>A google search shows she has a strong journalistic focus on online harassment. She even wrote an entire book about it. So regardless or not if she was directly provoked she&#39;s really speaking against the entire scourge of alt-right trolling in general.

<p>The chronology of the tweets as well as the fact they are parent tweets contradicts the claim that these were supposed to be direct retaliation to harassers.</p>

<p>The NYT started pushing this anti-white narrative when Obama was in office. Liberal media has made white hate trendy. Most people protesting for DACA and BLM are white. Publicly declaring hatred for your own race is now seen by leftists as a virtuous and selfless act. It&#39;s perverse narcissism at best, and plays to the mentality of perpetual victim-hood. </p>
