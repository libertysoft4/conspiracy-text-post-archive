        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Prereq: The background to understanding this perspective is a holographic Universe, one where morphic fields play a role in understanding cosmological evolution and creation. </p>

<p>When we think about water, the first thing we think of is it&#39;s vital to life. However, we also think of it as just an inert liquid that just so happens to be vitally important for chemistry - thus biology makes use of it. But really, why is it so important and ubiquitous in biology?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not an &#39;accident of chemistry&#39; that it just so happens to work for what the body needs, and unified physics is beginning to help us understand the true magic of water.</p>

<p>We know that 70+% of the brain is water, and &gt;60% of the body is water.</p>

<p>We also know the body doesn&#39;t &#39;process&#39; water, we don&#39;t break it down, we just &#39;use it&#39; for vitally important processes.</p>

<p>We&#39;re just starting to realize just how fundamental water is. For example, when water is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23567633">evacuated from microtubules</a> - the biomolecule loses it&#39;s ability to cohere and stay organized, it essentially falls apart. The water allows for a single protein to coordinate to it&#39;s larger molecule assembly.</p>

<p>We&#39;re also starting to realize that water is the actual mechanism in which <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/422605/water-solves-protein-folding-problem/"><em>folds proteins</em></a> - remember protein is surrounded by water, as are most biomolecules.</p>

<p>Water is tetrahedral and the vacuum is tetrahedral.</p>

<p>We&#39;re starting to speculate that the tetrahedral molecules can organize into immensely complex geometries, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cluster">water clusters</a> like an <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ralf_Ludwig3/publication/11952815/figure/fig19/AS:267982874083377@1440903504700/Figure-19-An-expanded-icosahedral-water-cluster-consisting-of-280-water-molecules-with-a.png">icosahedral cluster</a></p>

<p>The electromagnetic vacuum&#39;s information can be amplified, and transduced by water, it is essentially an antennae, a geometric repeater of electromagnetic fields.</p>

<p>So we have to reverse our thinking. Our body isn&#39;t utilizing water, water is forming and sustaining our body. Water is the electromagnetic field organizer that coheres and organizes basic molecules into biomolecules by resonating with the information in the holofield.  Imagine it like <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/XWDb8PSIv5EWc/giphy.gif">ferrofluid</a> and the holofield like the underlying complex electromagnetic field of information.</p>

<p>Water is the physical fluid that encompasses, entrains, and shares/resonates the electromagnetic field of our bodies from the morphic fields of space. </p>

<p>All matter is merely an organization of space, as space is electromagnetic field at ground state, matter is space in a coherent geometric state, all geometries of electromagnetic fields. Water is the extension of this organization into biology.</p>

<p>There&#39;s been astonishing experiments from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_teleportation">Nobel Prize winner</a> regarding water and DNA. </p>

<p>First - <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21457072">DNA acts as a fractal antennae in EM fields</a></p>

<p>Essentially, you take two glasses of water, one with extremely diluted DNA, and one with just water. An electromagnetic pulse was induced over the two samples, and DNA was then detectable in the second glass. The EM wave was 7hz, which is close to Earth&#39;s Schumann Resonance.</p>

<p>If we start thinking of DNA as an electromagnetic wave itself (remember, protons are electromagnetic vacuum spinning), and we pulse an electromagnetic field surrounding it - this probably allows for the water in the other glass to &#39;resonate&#39; with the information in the first glass. The EM wave acts as an entrainment carrier that turns the second glass into a tuning fork ready to accept imprinting of information, entraining it in the same field the DNA exists in. </p>

<p>The water is now ready to accept the information from the first glass and duplicate it, through reformation of the geometries of the field in the first cup through sympathetic resonance.</p>

<p><strong>Here&#39;s the kicker</strong> - this experiment worked non-locally. They&#39;ve recorded the EM waveform, e-mailed it somewhere, and repeated the duplication. It worked. This only makes sense if this is happening <em>non-locally</em> - i.e. when you use that waveform you are resonating with the holographic information no matter how far you are physically. The specific EM waveform is like an address that dials the water to the morphic information of the DNA that emitted the EM waveform.</p>

<p>It&#39;s probably important that the pulse was at 7hz, as this is Earth&#39;s magnetic field average - as such, it is most probable that the origin of life <em>on Earth</em> had a similar start - that is, an electromagnetic field + water turns the Earth into a sort of &#39;tuning fork&#39; ready to duplicate the holofield information on biomolecules. The more life has formed across the Universe, the easier it is for life to spontaneously cohere in a suitable environment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>awesome post!</p>

<p>also water is <em>polar</em>.  it can transport a charge.  it can be bent by charge.  </p>

<p>and it has distinct geometries in different states.  as a solid it&#39;s crystalline/hierarchical.  as a gel it&#39;s both crystalline and fluid, and has some weird properties around 0.  as a fluid and gas it&#39;s laminar and turbulent.  note the fractal nature of phi vs hierarchy AT EACH FUCKING STATE!.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely re: charge.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t get into this much - but microtubules are known to have atomic water channels. Microtubules make up all cellular structure.</p>

<p>The fast switching dipole oscillation of the water molecule within a microtubule very likely causes biophoton emission, something called superradience in quantum mind circles (Orch OR).</p>

<p>So your body is very likely made up of tubes filled with water that are firing coherent laser-light emissions used for the body to communicate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Recent advancements have enabled us to finally see this fine grained communication structure in the brain, and they&#39;ve discovered that thoughts, feelings, and memories are temporary phantasms that arise out of its startling complex order. The brains synaptic connections are ordered in up to 11 dimensions, and this sea of complex connections is constantly shifting and churning as it creates new geometries in reaction to stimulus, or thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here you go little guy. You need me to hold your hand and walk you through anything else just let me know. </p>

<p>&quot;It is as if the brain reacts to a stimulus by building [and] then razing a tower of multi-dimensional blocks, starting with rods (1D), then planks (2D), then cubes (3D), and then more complex geometries with 4D, 5D, etc,&quot; said one of the team, mathematician Ran Levi from Aberdeen University in Scotland.</p>

<p>&quot;The progression of activity through the brain resembles a multi-dimensional sandcastle that materialises out of the sand and then disintegrates.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen some vids about water... I really wanna try one of those vortex spouts that make the water swirl around and &quot;imprint&quot; it with a spiral shape. I have no idea if it actually works or how beneficial it is but sounds interesting and of potential. Nature does love spirals... prob why river water is supposed to be good for you. </p>

<p>Also, in Hinduism they often show gods holding a pot of water in one of their hands. A lot of Indians use copper pots (copper is basically magic, useful for elemag but also antibacterial) and keep water in it overnight, then say some mantras in the morning and  drink the water after, supposed to be very good for u. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, again, how exactly does this spiral imprinting work, first of all?</p>

<p>Secondly, surely spiral eddies are not frequent enough to be synonymous with rivers? Rivers have plenty of other current types and shapes that make them different from just spiral eddies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A video will prob show/explain it better, but I think it happens during certain situations, tho short durations... like when two waves going in different dirrections, or as waves hit rocks they form small swirls/vortexes esp if there are several stones around. </p>

<p>As for the imprinting, not sure... again a video will show the device and tech, they had a demonstration where they tested normal and their spiral water, used like a color dye and spun it and the spiral water kept spinning... it also apparently made plants grow much better. Water just does a lot of weird, interesting things.... I thought the idea was cool and while you can build your own fountain type deal to churn the water the little filter kit the dude made and sells was cheap and simple ot use. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As for the first part, you&#39;re simply describing a situation of fluid dynamics and potentially a constructive interference from waves colliding at an angle.</p>

<p>As for the imprinting, you&#39;re going to have to stack up some peer reviewed, published research that provides evidence of not only the concept of this but the actual effects it has on plants. Most certainly if it was this useful to crops it would be more widely known and understood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well as I said, its just what I saw in the video... but don&#39;t know if its true, with water taking diff shapes tho it seems just as possible. As for it being more well known... not so sure about that, only if you were searching for it do u find all the answers otherwise u just know whatever common knowledge or media wants to suggest. Take Tesla energy... can see plenty of videos online of people using it successfully, rodin coils and all that... but not well known, and even censored as certain groups do by buying up and covering patents.</p>

<p>There is other tech regarding plant growth too... organite, those pyramid shaped layered stone constructions which are supposed to channel the natural energy of the earth (apparently they &quot;bust clouds&quot; too and make em dissipate above you), as well as certain sigils that can be placed on the ground with specific shapes/angles that attract certain type of energy. There are a lot of accounts regarding the organite esp. that says it works, but not well known unless u find a video yourself. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-T7tCMUDXU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-T7tCMUDXU</a></p>

<p>Plenty of related videos on it, like on the vortex/ helical structure, people using it in greenhouses, the tools to make spiralized water. There are reports and evidence out there, just look around.  Its very interesting stuff. I dunno how accurate it is, or how much an improvement it makes, seems to have positive remarks and of all the things to test and put in our body, &quot;structured/helical&quot; water seems relatively safe and easy to do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, nothing in that video supported the existence of vortex/helical structured water. Secondly, none of it supported the idea of imprinting spirals into water.

<p>This is simply wrong. </p>

<p>The name for OH- is HYDOXIDE (ion). HYDROXYL refers to OH. (In my 15+ year career I have never once heard someone use the phrase hydroxyl ion in the context that you are trying to.) I work on and am expert on enzymes that have tyrosine active sites, making specific nomenclature important. </p>

<p>Explain to me the mechanism or reaction by which two hydroxides form hydrogen peroxide. </p>

<p>The above link is an SEM image of sodium chloride. I have worked on Scanning Electron Microscopes for two years now and have a vast amount of experience with their operation as well as what they demonstrate. This is a physical photograph supporting my understanding (and the world&#39;s understanding of) the structure of sodium chloride on an Angstrom level.</p>

<p>As for the bond length, I can Google the XRD pattern for sodium chloride. X-ray Diffraction can be used to measure every single bond length in a sample and can be used to determine the literal bond length. The following is a link to said evidentiary claim:</p>

<p><a href="http://physicsopenlab.org/2018/01/22/sodium-chloride-nacl-crystal/">http://physicsopenlab.org/2018/01/22/sodium-chloride-nacl-crystal/</a></p>

<p>In fact, I could go into lab tomorrow, toss up sodium chloride from Fischer Scientific and get these exact same results.</p>

<p>What about atoms, he says? The link after this demonstrates what is called TEM or Transmission Electron Microscopy. TEM imaging is even higher resolution than that of SEM and in the pictures you can actually see <em>physical fucking atoms</em> which are demonstrated by each dot.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/a-TEM-image-of-a-group-of-typical-halite-sodium-chloride-crystals-in-the-Parthenon_fig8_260363636">https://www.researchgate.net/figure/a-TEM-image-of-a-group-of-typical-halite-sodium-chloride-crystals-in-the-Parthenon_fig8_260363636</a></p>

<p>The ideas that were &quot;fed to me&quot; and that I &quot;regurgitated&quot; to you actually have one thing that&#39;s different than anything you have claimed thus far:
They are verifiable. 
They are repeatable. 
They are the foundational points of science itself. </p>

<p>What you choose to do, however, is deflect away and <em>still</em> continue to provide not a but of amount of evidentiary body supporting your stance.</p>

<p>there are no bond lengths. interpretation of x-ray diffraction patterns is open ended. all we know is that energy vibrations of differing frequencies interacted and resultant effects were measured. that&#39;s not proof of bond lengths, or atomic structure, or even the existence of atoms.</p>

<p>And to the last one: &quot;<em>there are no bond lengths</em>&quot; Well then. If you&#39;re willing to accept the concept of SEM and/or TEM but are trying to refute the atomic structure then I leave you with one simple task:</p>

<p>Explain how SEM and/or TEM work without the modern atomic structure being correct? (I&#39;ll give you a hint, it&#39;s not possible. Please feel free to stop picking and choosing what you want to agree to and not agree to.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>how does SEM work? it&#39;s simple. vibration. And I&#39;ll give you a hint, there are only vibrations and frequency. every fucking thing in the universe is frequency and vibration. sound, temperature, light, UV, etc. all energy(and thus matter) we experience is on a gradient of vibration from stillness to the limits of perception.</p>

<p>particle science dogma cannot not even resolve the atomic theory regarding the behavior of light. they say that matter emits excited &quot;electrons&quot; that become wave-particle duality photons? lol. The electron is a &quot;real&quot; thing they say, it&#39;s a particle, but it&#39;s also a probability cloud so you can&#39;t ever find it. it&#39;s fucking absurd. modern science is lost in fantasy land. </p>

<p>If there are no bond lengths, that would mean that NaCl would be a compact solid with NO space in between the atoms (that in your mind don&#39;t exist). </p>

<p>it&#39;s ALL empty space. vibration field effects create an illusion of solidity. your &quot;photo of an atom&quot; doesn&#39;t show an atom at all. it is a photograph of affected laser light, which again, is a vibration. </p>

<p>vibration is duality. in and out. duality is everything. all of existence is made up of duality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is the pivotal flaw with modern science. It is objective. It presents repeatable experiments, but only on the side of objective observation. A subjective reality is not compatible with it, because you cant &quot;prove&quot; it. So they ignore it. You ignore it.
You couldn&#39;t repeat what another experienced. Does that mean that what they experience isn&#39;t real? The &quot;real truth&quot; of the world is not the reduction into quantaties, names and concepts which your modern science says it is. There is a whole other side of reality.</p>

<p>The past is no more real than the future. Reality is no more real than the observing mechanisms to experience it. Past and future are experienced now. And reality is experienced in you. Who are you?</p>

<p>Not just mainstream science, but the entirety of reality built up in your mind prevents you from knowing the truth. You trained yourself. You confused yourself. Have fun.</p>

<p>Prereq: The background to understanding this perspective is a holographic Universe, one where morphic fields play a role in understanding cosmological evolution and creation.
When we think about water, the first thing we think of is it&#39;s vital to life. However, we also think of it as just an inert liquid that just so happens to be vitally important for chemistry - thus biology makes use of it. But really, why is it so important and ubiquitous in biology?
It&#39;s not an &#39;accident of chemistry&#39; that it just so happens to work for what the body needs, and unified physics is beginning to help us understand the true magic of water.
We know that 70+% of the brain is water, and &gt;60% of the body is water.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pun should be intended, it made me laugh and that <em>is</em> good debate strategy.</p>

<p>Anyway the ideas and concepts behind water being somehow magical go all the way back through modern fringe physicists, witches, medieval alchemists, ancient Greek philosophers... The place to put a stop to the actual theory and idea was, I don&#39;t know (help me out google: &quot;Greek philosopher everything is water&quot;) , around 600 BC when Thales of Miletus began preaching that water was the origin of and main building block of literally all matter and life.</p>

<p>So, no, you&#39;re not gonna kill this concept at its source, with or without swearing. You gotta try to convince people it&#39;s wrong. You don&#39;t go up to Christians saying, hey, God isn&#39;t real and it&#39;s all bullshit and you&#39;re stupid for believing in it. You don&#39;t say it to the family walking out of church on sunday, and you don&#39;t go to Vatican City and say it to the pope. Neither maneuver gains you anything, mostly just makes you look bad. Insecure, maybe, or afraid? Idk.</p>

<p>Again - I don&#39;t have a horse in this race. I&#39;ve read some of these theories and experiments over the years, and I&#39;m open to either possibility. All I&#39;m taking a stand against here is intelligent people (you) using poor debate tactics. End result for me is a little less raw negativity in the world, a little more intelligent discourse amongst people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;ve never been that tourist nor will I be. And if my general description of other Americans didn&#39;t tip you off, I&#39;m not singing the national anthem for shits and giggles either. I do get where you&#39;re coming from, 100%, but that just ain&#39;t me.</p>

<p>Idk tho I&#39;d think most of the world would be pretty happy to hear that many Americans don&#39;t identify as strictly American. It&#39;s kinda a fucked up place to be these days. Most of the &quot;Americans&quot; I&#39;ve met in my life have been terrifying, closed minded, misguided, and just... Ugh. Just no. Flag waving rednecks and truck driving NASCAR fans. There&#39;s gotta be something inbetween that and being the entitled tourist who&#39;s scouring the highlands looking for his great (x6) grandfather&#39;s moldy bones, right?</p>

I kinda wish there were more top posts about lizard people living in rock formations around Utah.</p>

<p>It’s like people only come here to tell each other not to believe things and mock people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because there is no evidence. There is a difference between finding evidence that leads to new knowledge and just thinking up a possibility without supporting evidence. </p>

<p>Regarding the flat earth, that &quot;knowledge&quot; wasn&#39;t the result of science. It was a superstition. Several different cultures independently found that the world was round. Modern flat earth theories <em>are</em> pseudoscience, because they rely on discarding well-validated evidence and proposing theories with little to no backing evidence.</p>

<p>The DNA transportation experiment the poster mentioned has not been successfully reproduced at all. Researchers carefully write down instructions to their experiments so they can be validated. If an experiment can&#39;t be reproduced, it is either because the initial experimenters fabricated their results, or botched/contaminated their experiment. </p>

<p>The onus of proof is on the person making a claim. If they can produce evidence, then people evaluate that evidence and either adopt or reject that claim based on it.</p>

<p>Your link and my link have the same veneer of being scientific, so how do I know one is reviewed and not the other, or neither are reviewed?</p>

<p>Abstract:
The experimental conditions by which electromagnetic signals (EMS) of low frequency can be emitted by diluted aqueous solutions of some bacterial and viral DNAs are described. That the recorded EMS and nanostructures induced in water carry the DNA information (sequence) is shown by retrieval of that same DNA by classical PCR amplification using the TAQ polymerase, including both primers and nucleotides. Moreover, such a transduction process has also been observed in living human cells exposed to EMS irradiation. These experiments suggest that coherent long-range molecular interaction must be present in water to observe the above-mentioned features. The quantum field theory analysis of the phenomenon is presented in this article.</p>

Second, some sub atomic particles, such as protons and electrons, haven&#39;t been shown to follow quantum entanglement, tunneling, etc., So there are clearly some exceptions.

<p>Because Robert Gallo and Montagnier still have the patent for HIV from 1984. </p>

<p>Gallo owns a patent to an HIV test, not to HIV.</p>

<p>Thus, this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>IF the genome changed the patent holders and date would be different.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is completely irrelevant and meaningless, since he patented the test, not the genome.</p>

<p>The HIV test reacts to antibodies against HIV -- these are antibodies against an expressed protein on HIV&#39;s surface. This wouldn&#39;t be effected by what he thought the genome contained: he grew the virus and obtained the corresponding protein from the source, and then reproduced it on test strip.</p>

<p>But, nothing in the supplied article suggests their test would be positive for anything but HIV, and it never mentioned HTLV, which you seem to have invoked from no where. In fact, the article you gave me lines up with anything you&#39;re saying.</p>

<p>So, this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To be an HIV test it has to react to the patented HIV from 1984 or else it cannot be termed that.</p>

<p>Appears to be bullshit.</p>

<p>There is no patent for the HIV virus -- in fact, you can&#39;t patent a virus out of the box; but you can patent a modified genetic organism. However, that&#39;s not what Gallo owns.</p>

<p>Gallo owns a patent for an HIV blood test. The article you cited was a dispute over whether he shares ownership because he used a blood sample obtained from another lab -- a blood sample which they proved belonged to them because it also contained HTLV, which was also in his cultures.</p>

<p>However, this has nothing to do with the virus or the test&#39;s accuracy, as HIV could be isolated from it.</p>

<p>You&#39;re buying into some really dangerous bullshit, and calling it fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, well first of all, I apologize as I thought you were talking about atoms since there is two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom per water molecule.</p>

<p>Secondly, you actually only need to technically react one hydrogen molecule and one oxygen molecule to form one water as they both naturally exist in diatomic form (H2 and O2). </p>

<p>Thirdly, what you&#39;re confusing here is molecular formation with states of matter. When molecules form from other atoms, they do such by forming or breaking chemical bonds. In this instance the bonds between their respective molecules breaks in hydrogen and oxygen (this is where energy input comes in) and then two hydrogens bond in a bent electronic geometry with water. This bond formation is where energy is released. (In other reactions this is where explosions happen.)</p>

<p>Now as for states of matter such as gas, liquid, and solid, these are functions of a bunch of molecules together and are due to a couple things such as molecular speed and spacing. In a gas, which for most substances is found at the higher temperature range, the particles have a lot of energy to move around with and do so frequently causing them to spread out. Since they move so fast past each other, it&#39;s hard for them to interact. As you cool temperature, the molecules slow down and thus coincidentally move closer together (liquid). At the lowest relative temperatures, a solid forms as the molecules hardly have energy from the environment to move around a lot and instead interact fully with the others around them by electronic interactions and group together.</p>

<p>While water vapor can be synthesized using hydrogen and oxygen gas, and then cooled to form water, it is also possible to form liquid water from liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. The reason you don&#39;t see this, however, is that it&#39;s extremely expensive and requires lots of equipment to hold liquid oxygen AND it&#39;s very very dangerous.</p>

When a water molecule forms it’s combined mass is heavier and the kinetic energy is lower. Also water self assembles via van der walls forces making the liquid state that much more possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Montagnier&#39;s experiment can be summarised as follows:</p>

<p>A known water sample with 2 ng/ml of 104 bases DNA from an HIV infected patient is diluted by 10 into water and agitated for 15 seconds. After filtration (to physically remove the DNA), the dilution and agitation steps are repeated 10 times, reaching high dilution levels (10−10).
The highly diluted sample emits electromagnetic signals (EMS) of low frequencies.
This EMS is recorded by a microphone coil and saved as a 6-second WAV file at the lab in Paris.
The WAV file is emailed to a partner team at the university of Benevento in Italy.
The Italian team emits in loop the EMS of the WAV file on a sample of distilled water with a coil in a sealed metal tube for 1 hour.
The water sample is then placed in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machine.
The PCR in Italy produces DNA, 98% identical to the initial DNA in Paris.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One, not calling you a pleb or anyone a pleb. Secondly, if the work an independent researcher provides is compelling enough, someone in academia will for sure pick it up. Third, you are sorely mistaken about the research process, as I both am an undergraduate and know several undergraduates who have published a research paper to a respectable journal before ever finishing a Bachelor&#39;s degree. Then there is graduate school where it&#39;s typically common in my field to publish about 5 before your PhD. Before applying to be a professor, most of academia requires one or two post docs which could have a couple of papers published before they are finished. Then there is the tenure track at most research based universities that require (I&#39;m not quite sure on exact #) like 5 years of research produced for a portfolio to even APPLY for tenure.</p>

<p>TLDR: You can easily publish a plethora of papers and get over thousands of citations before even thinking about tenure.</p>

In the biotech world we use deionized water because depending on what we are doing, we may want to positively charge the protein to bond or break bonds with cells. We use purified water too but not that often in my line of work though. If you think about it sea water is full of salt so it’s going to have a higher conductivity compared to your typical lake water. Ph I would think would remain the same. Water is pretty damn magical if you really think about it though. With the higher conductivity in the water it may be helping the electromagnetic properties of the earth. I’m probably wrong but great post! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;m not confusing that. If you read David Wilcock&#39;s second book, &quot;The Sourcefield Investigations&quot;, he connects the above type of experiments with reproductive experiments where interspecies hybrids are created without interspecies sex. I&#39;m not saying its factually wrong - but it seems to open the door to a whole host of pseudoreligious/pseudoscientific ideas related to reproduction. Knowing those connections are already established, that there is a new, multifacetted reproductive theory in the works, I&#39;m sure we&#39;re being lied to.

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post, OP.</p>

<p>The  chemistry of life is water chemistry. Without water&#39;s capacity to store  and share information as different vibrating frequencies in an extraordinary manner,living cells would not be able to communicate with each other.</p>

<p>Sonoluminescence  -- or spectacular conversion of sound to light , happens when water is  bombarded by intense light waves creating air bubbles which rapidly  contract and implode with a flash of light.</p>

<p>This light comes from ZERO POINT FIELD.</p>

<p>BTW, the 7Hz is the frequency Hindu King Mantra, OM. </p>

<p>Since life began, the Earth has been  surrounding and protecting all living things with a natural frequency  pulsation of 7.83 HZ—the ancient Indian Rishis called OM.   </p>

<p>OM mantra was uttered by the vedic sages who stayed on the banks of the  river Saraswati in 9000 BC. Vedic civilization of Saraswati flourished  till 4000 BC, till the river became non-perennial due to tectonic shifts  blocking the Himalayan Glacier mouth. The elite then migrated all over  including Western coast of India, Mesopotamia, Europe and Russia.</p>

<p>In deep meditation, when waves of alpha and  theta rhythms cascade across the entire brain, a resonance is possible  between the human being and the planet. Energy and information which are  embedded in the zero point field or aether field are transferred. The  planet communicates with us in this primal language of frequencies. A  living being is a  EMF field embedded within the EMF field of the earth. Each cell&#39;s DNA as a vibrating transmitter/receiver of information.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, d8_thc !</p>

<p>The world at present is just beginning to understand the ramifications of Quantum Physics.</p>

<p>It would take more than 500 yrs for modern scientists to figure out Vedanta, written down in 5000 BC (after being passed down for 30000 years by oral route).</p>

<p>Some points to ponder upon : -</p>

<p>VEDAS CONFIRM THAT COMMUNICATIONS CAN HAPPEN FASTER THAN LIGHT--AND VEDAS HAVE NOT BEEN PROVED WRONG YET .</p>

<p>Yet since the advent of quantum physics has revealed that Vedanta is beyond the cutting edge of physics, which is only now, discovering the illusory nature of physical reality and the existence of subtler energy and information currents behind all that we see.</p>

<p>Vedanta is the unitary philosophy explaining the oneness of the individual soul with the universal consciousness.</p>

<p>To a Vedantic every part of this universe is dynamic, it is vibrating, it is listening and can respond according to ones KARMA, It can be by action and can be purely thought. The universe listens to our action as well as thought and gives in return what exactly we want either knowingly or unknowingly, weather it is bad or good.</p>

<p>Quantum Teleportation ( mentioned in Vedas ) has been achieved. Scientists from China recently set the record for the farthest quantum teleportation ever, when they beamed a photon in its quantum state into orbit. This brings several quantum mechanical concepts into the equation, including quantum entanglement.</p>

<p>Teleportation is a verification of Quantum Entanglement</p>

<p>Action at a distance implies that a physical object can be moved by non-physical means, so not by touch or physical force. With entanglement, it means that either information is travelling FAR FAR faster than the speed of light ( VEDAS SAYS IT IS INSTANTANEOUS )</p>

<p>Worldview paradigms are changing, yet old scientific dogma ( THANKS TO THE KUNT POP ) still sticks around and dominates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was expecting you to get into structured water.  For those who don&#39;t know, they took water from waterfalls, streams and tap and found the former two had completely different electromagnetic properties.  They mimicked this by making a hexagonal cone distorted such that the apexes formed a spiral.  No human experiments I know of, but plants given the same amount of nutrients grew phenomenally better if watered with structured water.  This relates to why hexagons are so prevalent in nature.  They are the most structurally sound shape, able to interlock, and most efficient at promoting flow.  This last part is key.  It allows water to adopted the most electromagnetically harmonious configuration. By subjecting water to a stronger, implosive electromagnetic field you can even initiate hydrolysis with petty amounts of electricity, basically creating a self contained hydrogen cell.  </p>

<p>The long hydrocarbon chains on the fatty acids do not like being in water, hence we use soap which is a surfactant and creates micelles to trap non polar organics.</p>

<p>Life depends on the non solubility of non polar organics by using that to create cell membranes by creating phospholipid bilateral where the outside is hydrophilic and the inside is hydrophobic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A video will prob show/explain it better, but I think it happens during certain situations, tho short durations... like when two waves going in different dirrections, or as waves hit rocks they form small swirls/vortexes esp if there are several stones around. </p>

<p>As for the imprinting, not sure... again a video will show the device and tech, they had a demonstration where they tested normal and their spiral water, used like a color dye and spun it and the spiral water kept spinning... it also apparently made plants grow much better. Water just does a lot of weird, interesting things.... I thought the idea was cool and while you can build your own fountain type deal to churn the water the little filter kit the dude made and sells was cheap and simple ot use. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, nothing in that video supported the existence of vortex/helical structured water. Secondly, none of it supported the idea of imprinting spirals into water. Thirdly, TEDx talks, while interesting, are not research articles with quantifiable data and conclusions drawn directly from linked evidence.</p>
