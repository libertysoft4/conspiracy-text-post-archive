        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Vaccines don&#39;t cause autism</strong>, there are thousands of studies that show vaccines are not related to autism and the science is settled. Nothing to see here we are being told. Is this really true?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WebMD - The research is clear: <strong>Vaccines don’t cause autism</strong>. More than a dozen studies have tried to find a link. Each one has come up empty.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic - <strong>Vaccines do not cause autism</strong>. Despite much controversy on the topic, researchers haven&#39;t found a connection between autism and childhood vaccines</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is what the high priests of vaccinology say summarizing that studies that had been done so far:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908388/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2908388/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Twenty epidemiologic studies have shown that <strong>neither thimerosal nor MMR vaccine causes autism</strong>. These studies have been performed in several countries by many different investigators who have employed a multitude of epidemiologic and statistical methods. The large size of the studied populations has afforded a level of statistical power sufficient to detect even rare associations. These studies, in concert with the <strong>biological implausibility</strong> that vaccines overwhelm a child’s immune system, have effectively dismissed the notion that vaccines cause autism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What they are saying is that they have investigated whether or not mercury in vaccines causes autism and whether or not the MMR vaccine causes autism. They have investigated <strong>1 vaccine</strong> and <strong>1 ingredient</strong> so far. There are over 10 childhood vaccines given in 40+ injections and dozens of ingredients. That means they have never investigated whether or not the current childhood vaccination schedule with over 60 vaccines doses given can increase the risk of developing Autism.</p>

<p>According to them they have not studied it because it would be unethical and would lead to unreliable results.</p>

<p>So what they have done was to compare the health outcomes of vaccinated children to the health outcomes of other vaccinated children.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>No studies have compared the incidence of autism in vaccinated, unvaccinated, or alternatively vaccinated children</strong> ....These studies would be difficult to perform because of the likely differences among these 3 groups in health care seeking behavior and the ethics of experimentally studying children who have not received vaccines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason why they think that giving too many vaccines can&#39;t cause autism is because they say it is biologically implausible. They haven&#39;t done the studies but they don&#39;t believe it could happen because it seems implausible.</p>

<p>Of course if you think vaccines are the greatest gift to mankind and you could give 10000 vaccines in one day you don&#39;t believe vaccines could possibly do any harm.</p>

<p>In addition in the MMR and mercury studies there is possible bias and data manipulation so we can&#39;t even say mercury in vaccines or the MMR vaccine is safe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGwzAfRORw0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGwzAfRORw0</a><br/>
<a href="http://vaccinepapers.org/healthy-user-bias-why-most-vaccine-safety-studies-are-wrong/">http://vaccinepapers.org/healthy-user-bias-why-most-vaccine-safety-studies-are-wrong/</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlxdWfTLHH0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlxdWfTLHH0</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in reality we have never studied whether or not vaccines can cause Autism but the vaccine experts <strong><em>believe</em></strong> they don&#39;t so it is a belief based on faith not on science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You cannot sue in america and they have the highest rate of vaccinations, they pump them out because no liability.  Other countries have less vaccines and adopted similar programs to the 1986 act.  In Canada you can &quot;technically&quot; sue, you will basically never win and they don&#39;t have their own compensation act, even if you do sue them the legal battles take years and years, they make it take as long as possible so that you give up or die in the mean time, usually they coerce you into settling out of court.  There are people who win these battles, but you&#39;ve just spent years of your life fighting something you have a low chance of winning since you are likely not an expert and do not have all the information and are expected to go up against this super giant industry that is presumed safe because we haven&#39;t done the proper safety studies like saline placebos, vax vs unvax, long-term, or looking for autism at more than 1 vaccine and 1 ingredient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every parent has the same story when the noticeable changes take place. The kid receives vaccinations, that night, the child is irritable, high fever, crying like they&#39;re being hurt and everything goes downhill from there. Seizures, banging head on wall, loses everything the kid has learned up to that point, the talking, the walking, the look in the kids eyes like nobody is home and they witness their kid change over a few days. Those are the lucky kids, I guess. The unlucky kids will die. I personally know 3 families who lost children after getting vaxxed. My friend was watching his three month old nephew who received shots earlier in the day, his nephew died in his crib that night. &quot;SIDS&quot; they said. 
A year and a half ago my daughters friend got the HPV vaccine, she was home with her younger brother that night and he heard her crying in the bathroom, thought nothing of it. Finally went to check on her and she was deceased on the floor. Medical examiner said cause if death was &quot;natural causes&quot; I mean wtf? Seriously? 
Another family friend had twin girls, also my daughters friends, at their 6 month vaccinations, one of the twins reacted bad from it and was seriously messed up, RIGHT AFTER RIGHT AFTER RIGHT AFTER getting that round and permanently damaged her and she did finally pass away 2 years ago. She suffers a vaccine injury that made her suffer her entire life, it damaged her heart and her brain. Those are just the ones I know personally who died. I know several others affected some way by vaccinations. I know one family who received money from the vaccine courts because it was proven the vaccines she recieved gave her severe autism. 
BTW the vaccine court has paid out 3 or 4 billion to vaccine injured ppl since 1986 so your argument that vaccines are safe doesn&#39;t hold water. 
The meningitis vaccine almost killed me when I was 2.
So it&#39;s not just autism that is the focus here. Vaccine are killing kids, babies, causing severe brain damage and many other life long aliments. Read the actual inserts of the side affects.   It&#39;s beyond calling it possible side affects. Those side affects are happening, everyday. 
There has never been. Any long term testing on the combined multidose vax schedule they push today and inject into little babies. You really think a newborn can handle the same amount of everything in the MMR shot as well as a grown adult who decides to get another MMR shot?  Both receive the exact same shot! That amount of crap wreaks havoc on a newborn or young baby, ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!?! </p>

<p>The problem with you ppl defending vaccines and say they&#39;re safe is you can&#39;t bring yourselves to admit you blindly followed the pediatricians orders, you didn&#39;t educate before you vaccinate, didn&#39;t ask questions. You did absolutely nothing before letting someone inject something into your children. Inside your heart you know there is bad stuff in those shots but staying in denial gets you off the hook for being completely irresponsible and risking your kids health and life by questioning nothing at all. Just believe the pediatrician because he&#39;s in a doctor costume. Maybe your kids did get fucked up, just blame something else then. Whatever doesn&#39;t make you feel guilty. 
A cpl of the parents I know who had kids die or became injured choose denial as well. That would be hard to live with when someone could have just asked a few questions. </p>

<p>So you daughter skipped the incubation period of pneumonia? Sorry to tell you this but she probably had it before she got the vaccine because you definitely can&#39;t go from completely healthy to &quot;full blown pneumonia&quot; in less than 2 days and definitely not from a pneumonia vaccine since those don&#39;t actually contain any bacteria in them.<br/>
TLDR: She didn&#39;t get pneumonia from the vaccine.</p>

<p>There are 1000s of reports like this. Lots of kids and adults get sick (in various ways) after they got vaccinated. Your daughter’s natural immune system could have been fighting off a flu when she got vaccinated. This process was interrupted by vaccination.</p>

<p>They rely on a single UK study that would mostly track mild cases and tells us nothing about severe autism.</p>

<p>There are many better studies that show a dramatic increase.</p>

<p>Autism  is now bigger than heart disease and cancer combined (in terms of economic impact) and still growing and the funds and the services are not there and parents are begging for help. We surely didn&#39;t notice that for the past 30 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The current research shows aluminium adjuvants are strongly linked to autism. When you inject a child with a vaccine containing aluminium it gets transported via immune cells called macrophages across the blood brain barrier and it stays there. Once there high levels of the cytokyne interleukin-6 occur and persistent brain inflammation also occurs. This causes brain damage in the children which causes autism. </p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.vaccinepapers.org">www.vaccinepapers.org</a>  for more information about this subject.
 Its an absolute goldmine of objective information about vaccines and autism and other issues relating to vaccines.</p>

<p>The science is very clearly pointing towards aluminium adjuvants as causing autism and the information is getting clearer and clearer as time passes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read one study that showed that mercury in a vaccine was low enough, to be safe. But that was assuming that the vaccine would be given in at least 6 separate doses over the course of a year, but in reality, it&#39;s hiven in 1 to 3 doses. Thus it actually does cause damage.</p>

<p>This is the same as the study on thesis monkies decades ago, that tried to prove that smoking cannabis causes brain damage. The study was supposed to go on for a year, but the guy running it, didn&#39;t want to pay an assistant for the full year, but instead did it in 6 months. Which required them to double the dosage given. In the end, it proved that lack of oxygen causes brain damage.</p>

<p>Same idea, but kinda opposite points.</p>
