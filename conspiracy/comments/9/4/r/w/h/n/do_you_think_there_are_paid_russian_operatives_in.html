    <div class="md"><p>Eh, there likely was, at one point, but I don&#39;t see the purpose, anymore.</p>

<p>Paid operatives are there to push the ball forward, to put direction, inertia into it.</p>

<p>The success of said operation(s) are evidence by locals, Americans, North Americans, westerners, humans of all walks, duped into doing the work of these operatives.</p>

<p>You only need to start a rumour, one sufficiently captivating, and then said rumours, that shit information, those contagious diseases of the mind will propagate themselves. </p>

<p>Once enough impressionable minds associate their own identity with the propaganda, then it becomes natural for them to take up the cause as their own.</p>

<p>So, maybe, but I don&#39;t see the point. </p>

<p>There are enough man-children who identify with Trump, poor, impressionable folks suffering from schizophrenia, and the appeal of Christian-undertones to turn a large portion of vulnerable redditors, Americans, humans more generally, against one another, toward support of such black eyes as The_Donald, such delusions as the Q-spiracy that Trump is Christ, the Earth is flat and 6,000 years old, etc., etc.</p>

<p>The organic success of Flat Earth, of anti-vaxx parents... all of this is proof that we need not paid foreign agents, at least not anymore, to so thoroughly fuck ourselves out of rational discourse.</p>

<p>I once shared information supporting McCain and Palin, because I thought it was soooo funny...</p>

<p>Were I still 14? No sex, already being told I&#39;m a shithead by girls, wanting to grab pussy like our powerful president?</p>

<p>I&#39;d probably shill for Trump, and I&#39;d also hate myself, and my mental health would likely take a nose dive.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I have since reformed.</p>

<p>Oh, Carl Sagan... where are all the kind, scientifically literate people? Why couldn&#39;t you be leading us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s not go with &quot;highly likely&quot;. Let&#39;s go with facts. Here is the Reddit&#39;s 2017 transparency report and info on Russians on Reddit</p>

<p>np.reddit.com<a href="/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/dx5chv1/">/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/dx5chv1/</a>?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=announcements</p>

<p>Here is spez clarifying where Russians posted. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There were about 14k posts in total by all of these users. The top ten communities by posts were:
funny: 1455
uncen: 1443
Bad_Cop_No_Donut: 800
gifs: 553
PoliticalHumor: 545
The_Donald: 316
news: 306
aww: 290
POLITIC: 232
racism: 214
We left the accounts up so you may dig in yourselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Russians didn&#39;t hit r/conspiracy hard.</p>

<p>Now, take a closer look at the impact posts had. Here is spez again</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In my post last month, I described that we had found and removed a few hundred accounts that were of suspected Russian Internet Research Agency origin. I’d like to share with you more fully what that means. At this point in our investigation, we have found 944 suspicious accounts, few of which had a visible impact on the site:</p>

<p>70% (662) had zero karma
1% (8) had negative karma
22% (203) had 1-999 karma
6% (58) had 1,000-9,999 karma
1% (13) had a karma score of 10,000+</p>

<p>Of the 282 accounts with non-zero karma, more than half (145) were banned prior to the start of this investigation through our routine Trust &amp; Safety practices. All of these bans took place before the 2016 election and in fact, all but 8 of them took place back in 2015. This general pattern also held for the accounts with significant karma: of the 13 accounts with 10,000+ karma, 6 had already been banned prior to our investigation—all of them before the 2016 election. Ultimately, we have seven accounts with significant karma scores that made it past our defenses.</p>

<p>And as I mentioned last time, our investigation did not find any election-related advertisements of the nature found on other platforms, through either our self-serve or managed advertisements. I also want to be very clear that none of the 944 users placed any ads on Reddit. We also did not detect any effective use of these accounts to engage in vote manipulation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>np.reddit.com<a href="/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/">/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/</a></p>

<p>Impact:
Spez says few had a visible impact. Only 7 did.  About 14k posts spread across 994 accounts. That is roughly 14 posts per account averaged. 70% zero karma and 1% 100k+ karma. 22% sitting at 1-999 karma. Anyone who bothered to look would easily recognize them as shill or throwaway accounts. Here they are</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/suspiciousaccounts">https://www.reddit.com/wiki/suspiciousaccounts</a></p>

<p>Moreover these accounts mostly link. They hardly say anything (when they say anything at all). </p>

<p>Your &quot;evidence&quot; is not evidence. It is feels. What you are saying does not jive with reality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are enough man-children who identify with Trump, poor, impressionable folks suffering from schizophrenia, and the appeal of Christian-undertones to turn a large portion of vulnerable redditors, Americans, humans more generally, against one another, toward support of such black eyes as The_Donald, such delusions as the Q-spiracy that Trump is Christ, the Earth is flat and 6,000 years old, etc., etc.</p>

<p>The organic success of Flat Earth, of anti-vaxx parents... all of this is proof that we need not paid foreign agents, at least not anymore, to so thoroughly fuck ourselves out of rational discourse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are presented a shoddy narrative, throwing around ad hominems and gaslighting.</p>

<p>ex. many on r/conspiracy do not view the Flat-Earth as organic but rather a psyop.</p>

<p>The truth is, it is impossible to take people accusing other people on r/conspiracy of being Russian seriously. I might win the lottery today. Or I might be posting from a Russian IRA troll factory. Both are just as likely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But, yeah, that&#39;s largely unnecessary</p>

<p>My post was longer than it was clear. We are agreeing, some. Let me rephrase, for clarity.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe there is a significant Russian presence on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, nor do I believe there was any kind of significant presence. I figure there was, some presence, surely. For, were I an officer, orchestrating such a scheme, I&#39;d for sure get my foot, my foot soldiers into subs that deal with conspiracies, descent, alternative thought.  </p>

<p>But, yeah, that&#39;s largely unnecessary.   </p>

<p>I imagine it&#39;s 99.89% the cult of personality of Trump, of the malleability of the minds of those who would be drawn to a subreddit that talks about alternative truths (whatever that means), and, bigly, Christians who believe god is an old-testament capitalist.  </p>

<p>My post, above, was to say that, yeah, there was more than zero inteference, here, but it was us who fucked ourselves.  </p>

<p>Hell, not only did I find pizzagate persuasive, I remember going on and on about how terrible Hillary would be, but how I&#39;d probably rather support her than Trump.  </p>

<p>PROBABLY???!!</p>

<p>Did the Russians cause me to espouse such bullshit? Nope. That was my own fallible mind... not aware than it was getting psyop-fucked, unaware that I was reading reddit links, smack dab in the middle of a ruthless information war.  </p>

<p>Oh, and, yeah, shame on me for the ad hominem attacks. I&#39;d like to think I&#39;m typically better than that.  </p>

<p>Good to know that you and others believe the flat-Earth to be a psyop... I know too many damn people who have lost their minds to such useless rabbit holes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s not go with &quot;highly likely&quot;. Let&#39;s go with facts. Here is the Reddit&#39;s 2017 transparency report and info on Russians on Reddit</p>

<p>np.reddit.com<a href="/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/dx5chv1/">/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/dx5chv1/</a>?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=announcements</p>

<p>Here is spez clarifying where Russians posted. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There were about 14k posts in total by all of these users. The top ten communities by posts were:
funny: 1455
uncen: 1443
Bad_Cop_No_Donut: 800
gifs: 553
PoliticalHumor: 545
The_Donald: 316
news: 306
aww: 290
POLITIC: 232
racism: 214
We left the accounts up so you may dig in yourselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Russians didn&#39;t hit r/conspiracy hard.</p>

<p>Now, take a closer look at the impact posts had. Here is spez again</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In my post last month, I described that we had found and removed a few hundred accounts that were of suspected Russian Internet Research Agency origin. I’d like to share with you more fully what that means. At this point in our investigation, we have found 944 suspicious accounts, few of which had a visible impact on the site:</p>

<p>70% (662) had zero karma
1% (8) had negative karma
22% (203) had 1-999 karma
6% (58) had 1,000-9,999 karma
1% (13) had a karma score of 10,000+</p>

<p>Of the 282 accounts with non-zero karma, more than half (145) were banned prior to the start of this investigation through our routine Trust &amp; Safety practices. All of these bans took place before the 2016 election and in fact, all but 8 of them took place back in 2015. This general pattern also held for the accounts with significant karma: of the 13 accounts with 10,000+ karma, 6 had already been banned prior to our investigation—all of them before the 2016 election. Ultimately, we have seven accounts with significant karma scores that made it past our defenses.</p>

<p>And as I mentioned last time, our investigation did not find any election-related advertisements of the nature found on other platforms, through either our self-serve or managed advertisements. I also want to be very clear that none of the 944 users placed any ads on Reddit. We also did not detect any effective use of these accounts to engage in vote manipulation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>np.reddit.com<a href="/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/">/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/</a></p>

<p>Impact:
Spez says few had a visible impact. Only 7 did.  About 14k posts spread across 994 accounts. That is roughly 14 posts per account averaged. 70% zero karma and 1% 100k+ karma. 22% sitting at 1-999 karma. Anyone who bothered to look would easily recognize them as shill or throwaway accounts. Here they are</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/suspiciousaccounts">https://www.reddit.com/wiki/suspiciousaccounts</a></p>

<p>Moreover these accounts mostly link. They hardly say anything (when they say anything at all). </p>

<p>Your &quot;evidence&quot; is not evidence. It is feels. What you are saying does not jive with reality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are enough man-children who identify with Trump, poor, impressionable folks suffering from schizophrenia, and the appeal of Christian-undertones to turn a large portion of vulnerable redditors, Americans, humans more generally, against one another, toward support of such black eyes as The_Donald, such delusions as the Q-spiracy that Trump is Christ, the Earth is flat and 6,000 years old, etc., etc.</p>

<p>The organic success of Flat Earth, of anti-vaxx parents... all of this is proof that we need not paid foreign agents, at least not anymore, to so thoroughly fuck ourselves out of rational discourse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are presented a shoddy narrative, throwing around ad hominems and gaslighting.</p>

<p>ex. many on r/conspiracy do not view the Flat-Earth as organic but rather a psyop.</p>

<p>The truth is, it is impossible to take people accusing other people on r/conspiracy of being Russian seriously. I might win the lottery today. Or I might be posting from a Russian IRA troll factory. Both are just as likely. </p>
