        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi guys, </p>

<p>This has been something bothering me for a while, it seems to me that this community is devolving into merely copying and pasting MSM news articles in an attempt to garner themselves easy karma. I don’t understand why certain posts are being hammered to death when there is no conspiracy behind it. This community is being relegated to the smaller sibling of r/News and r/Politics. </p>

<p>I noticed this trend with the Trump/Putin thing we’re people were merely reposting HuffPo, WashPo, NYT, etc articles about the conference. This is not at all what this community should be about. We are about uncovering kooky, crazy, and almost impossible to believe topics that the MSM would never touch</p>

<p>Have we forgotten that these media outlets have propagated and disseminated mis/dis info pieces that have lead to the death of our countrymen, endless debt, and death of innocent foreigners, etc. Why are people merely reposting these articles when they aren’t germane to our community. </p>

<p>I have to scroll so far down to find quality posts about the Egyptian Pyramids being used for electromagnetic stuff (I barely get that stuff haha), the Denver Int’l Airport murals, reptilians, or the Nephilim that were omitted from the Bible. Those are the posts I’m sure this community was created for, not for partisan bickering that I could easily get in r/News and r/Politics. </p>

<p>Let’s not forget that these news agencies are PROPAGANDA machines that are created to mislead us into the abyss. Many users here are endlessly lapping it up. </p>

<p>The Sarah Jeong (whatever her name is) issue is horrible, certainly, racism is unacceptable. But this is no conspiracy post. One post would have sufficed but this is being beaten like a horse. To the point where I don’t want to open this sub because that’s all I’ll see for 5 mins  </p>

<p>Another thing that I happened to me this morning is that I posted a “controversial” comment and I was downvoted like crazy - which I’m fine with - but I got a PM from someone who agreed with my opinion but was probably too afraid to post publicly because of the backlash. I mentioned this and someone replied that this has been happening to him as well, that he too had been receiving PMs of people who agreed but were too scared to post. Moreover, he was also receiving threatening PMs which is absolutely unacceptable. I have no idea why anyone would get so worked up about a comment by some random person on the internet to threaten their life. </p>

<p>Are we seriously that obsessed with our karma that we are afraid to voice our opinions or because we’ll be called racist or other unfavorable terms? Why are we attacking one another to the point of death threats?The MSM is already waging a war on “conspiracy theorists” so if we attack each other, we are ripe for the picking. </p>

<p>We must unite and be friendly with each other, note I didn’t say friends. We can agree to disagree and engage with one another but we must remain polite and germane to the whole purpose of this community which is uncovering stories that will never see the light of day in the MSM. </p>

<p>This turned out to be too long, but thanks for reading. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its very simple, and countless other subs do it, to have a rule limiting what content can be posted. Its not censorship if it can simply be discussed elsewhere, and its required to stop this place being flooded by msm content. Alternatively, enforce strictly one post per topic that msm is already covering, to help avoid the constant spamming we have now. The whole “just scroll down” argument is weightless, as all this msm content is drowning usual discussion.</p>

<p>CNN links are (rightfully) already not allowed.  r/conspiracy mods need to follow through and and do the same for all centrist MSM websites.</p>

<p>This fits the community ethos of peaceful protest.  What better way to show solidarity from this community than hitting these companies where it hurts: by taking away ad revenue.</p>

<p>It comes down to this: this Trump/Russia thing is a conspiracy. If accusations are true, people conspired to win the presidency with the help of a foreign government. Would this not be bigger than Watergate?</p>

<p>So what&#39;s the problem with its discussion here? That you don&#39;t agree with the accusations? Pick any media source you want - it&#39;s not the media running the investigation and laying charges. So you don&#39;t like a link from CNN, so what? Would you rather people link directly to indictments? This story isn&#39;t <em>coming from</em> the media. </p>

<p>If this subreddit existed during Watergate, how would you have felt about posts discussing it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh god those super smart cities that are supposedly the very effigy of perfectly equally faily distributed resources thruogh the bloody aid of technology and letting it do it all for you coz humans cant do it... its not new, from that zeit people. It is popular to a group of people, they think itll give em that. The perfect socialist utopia... </p>

<p>But thats just a smart system, its not the same as a conscious machine. Its just like many things, what we have elevated to a grander scale. A conscious one would ask, why must I give this human being water today.</p>

<p>And people would give up their land, their houses, their way of lives to just go along with this? Because demolition on a massive scale is required for that thing in total execution of the concept. But then again, who cares about them, they will be forced out if ever. And the rest, wont really mind bec theyre promised something great to just shut up and watch and move along.</p>

<p>Id say, your bigger worry is not having enough jobs left down the line as just like in factories, more machinery can do the same things you used to do. Vs machines killing you. </p>

<p>Just as people got used to the internet, people will at that point get used to subsisting. And they will love it, because its the new way, it is progress. </p>

I&#39;ve even seen folks comment in other places that they don&#39;t care what the person said, they&#39;re just using outrage mobs against political rivals until the other side sees how harmful it is and agrees to stop.</p>

For one, I think what she said is racist and I don&#39;t like it being handwaved away, but the outcry over this seems a bit over the top. I also noticed in a news thread that there were tons of comments of the idea that without power you can&#39;t be racist. That view is common on Tumblr maybe and a few subreddits, but not most of Reddit. It seemed like there were tons of people commenting with that and being downvoted. It seemed like people were commenting that idea specifically to give credence to the idea that more people think like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I Saw that video on the actual Q sub but I’m still not convinced it’s real. I still have the impression/feeling it’s a little too ra ra ra Trump when we should still be criticizing him when he makes mistakes. I’ll probably vote form him in 2020 but I’m not on his “team” my team is individual freedom and liberty. If he best represents that I’ll vote, if someone comes and does a better job then I’ll vote for that person. </p>
