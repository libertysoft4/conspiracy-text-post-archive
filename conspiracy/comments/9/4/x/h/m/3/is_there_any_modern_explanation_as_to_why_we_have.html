    <div class="md"><p>FDR was a good guy in some aspects but was definitely a controlled man. I don’t know history exactly but he got us out of the Great Depression which was caused by giant bankers like JP Morgan rocking the economy so they could push the idea of the federal reserve central bank system for America so they could control our money. And like they wanted, it happened. JFK tried to stop it later on and you see what happened to him. So now we are controlled by elite super wealthy bankers that, from overwhelming evidence, seem to worship the devil or something close to it. They are the ones who put that symbol on the bill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The industrial build up to WW2 got us out of the Great Depression. FDR was a collectivist and autocrat who would have gladly been named president for life if he hadn’t been thwarted by his own ailing health and subsequent loss of political capitol. He was raised to believe that as a man of family pedigree and economic means he knew what Americans needed better than they did for themselves. This progressive idealism led to his implementing the economically burdensome New Deal programs, some of which we still deal with today. </p>

<p>I like the Art Deco architecture of the new deal civil works projects, but it was a disaster for this country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Great Depression has nothing to do with the creation of the Federal Reserve. The FED was instated in 1913. This was well before the Great Depression.  The depression was caused by massive (artificial) credit expansion by the Federal Reserve in the 1920’s. And we were in the depression for the entirety of FDRs 13 years as president. He prolonged the depression, was a free mason himself, and was (in my opinion) one of the worst and most tyrannical presidents this country has ever had.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Great Pyramid in Egypt is missing the capstone. Jesus is metaphorically the missing capstone/cornerstone of the great temple. Thus it represents Jesus (or someone, even humanity in general) in an ascended state - a future completion to now yet incomplete work. It&#39;s very Christian and very Masonic and very Hermetic and New Age and maybe even Jewish and Zoroastrian and Sufi/Islamic all at the same time. Trying to get it removed thus is fighting against multiple mystical traditions who give some symbolic import to the pyramid but don&#39;t necessarily want to tell you about it.</p>

<p>It’s the symbol for God in Christianity and Christianity is the follow on of Egyptian religion</p>

<p>The founding fathers were Christian etc </p>

<p>Most older European churches you will see the same symbol, eye within the triangle and light emanations on all sides with the four letter word for god beneath. </p>

<p>Free masons would also use the symbol as they also believe in god.</p>

<p>Still at odds to where or why the illuminated ones use it etc </p>
