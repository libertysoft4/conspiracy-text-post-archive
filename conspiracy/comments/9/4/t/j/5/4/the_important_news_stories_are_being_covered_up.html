        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Forum sliding is when the same news story is recycled and reposted any time something important gains traction.</p>

<p>Before it was lyme disease and it&#39;s supposed origins. Remember? Lyme disease was used for weeks, easily making it to the top spot any time they needed to cover up an important topic that somehow makes it past vote brigades.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s Sarah Jeong. These topics do nothing for the conspiracy community. They do not contribute real information. They simply create distraction and disinformation.</p>

<p>What we should be talking about are the very real problems brought on by greed, sexual obsession, and the environment. Although this is one subreddit, people try to keep even this place from having free discussion.</p>

<p>For the last four days forum sliding has become more brazen than ever before. I doubt this thread will even make it far due to what they are doing here. If anyone does read this, please be aware of the damage forum sliding does and the little bit of time we have to really make a positive difference in the world.</p>

<p>This small corner of the internet is valuable and can inform people on the horrors being committed right now. But it is up to us to keep it updated with relevant news stories and not the same recycled crap meant to distract.</p>

<p>Precisely why I suggested reporting on everything (as I said also: evidenced), regardless of whether it is important to you or not... it&#39;s literally what the news should be doing, but isn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a good point, but it&#39;s only applicabe to the normally vocal minority.

<p>Also, the learned helplessness to pointing out the injustices of the bankster oligarchy isn&#39;t because of the magnitude of the injustices, or even because we&#39;re not being vocal enough, it&#39;s mostly because our signals intelligence agencies like the NSA have been taken over. All of the methods they&#39;ve developed over the decades, not only the technical feats, but feats of social engineering as well, like the meme culture created to quell communism, they&#39;ve been turned against the principles of democracy they were originally designed to protect. Now they&#39;re used to censor and obfuscate the truth, to keep the military-industrial machine chugging along.</p>

<p>9/11 and the aftermath proved that framework of rules and laws does not exist for these people!! But oh well at least we can still get Clinton for her email. NO WE CANT !! We cannot get Bush or Cheyne or Rumsfeld for crimes against humanity !! These are convicted war criminals and terrorists !! Guilty of mass murder, torturing prisoners, treason against the United States and we can do nothing !! What is it about this you and others like you do not understand?? We have no democracy or government anymore!! We have only a criminal mafiosa in charge and they will do what ever the hell they want!!</p>

<p>You know what&#39;s forum sliding?  r/news hiding the Jeong story, removing article submissions, locking a submission with 16,000 plus upvotes, and then the Reddit admin removing it from the front page.</p>

<p>You can say what you want, but there was a collective and co-ordinated push by MSM and various people to protect and defend the New York Times hiring of a racist.</p>

<p>r/conspiracy luckily is one last area of free speech that still hasn&#39;t been completely subverted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but the truth not some disinformation lie. They put the same website about some documentary, the same story about it originating from some military facility in Lyme, Connecticut when in reality lyme disease was around much longer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lyme disease has been around for centuries. The first case of Lyme disease was recorded in 1883 in Germany. In 1909 Arvid Afzelius presented his research on the ring like rash (erythema migrans) which would later become known as the tell-tale rash of Lyme disease.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. NYT takes a position that is sure to stoke the outrage. We used to call that LARPing. </p>

<p>Certain people take the bait and run with it, never even considering that NYT is in on the conspiracy to distract.</p>

<p>Which means NYT is <em>helping</em> Donald Trump, which should not be a surprise. MSM in general stoked the outrage nonstop before the election, but they had no problem giving Donald Trump the most massive free uncensored live speech time in the history of broadcast media. </p>

<p>Then, when Donald Trump got into the White House, they all acted so surprised.</p>

<p>FYI, the alt-right invented the term &quot;alt-right&quot; to describe itself. There&#39;s no such thing as the &quot;alt-left&quot;. But that is kinda beside the point.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve told you repeatedly what my <em>specific</em> issue is with this thing and, after a sweet bit of strawmanning and lying/assuming about my motivations, you seem unwilling to discuss it specifically (even though it&#39;s very on-topic for this thread).</p>

<p>OK, so the left has done bad stuff. The left started this or that. Sure. I believe you. I don&#39;t dispute it. Some leftists&#39; obsessions are highly contemptible or insincere in their own right. But I&#39;m not an ambassador for the left. I&#39;m not even American. </p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about specific current events that are largely non-conspiratorial; disproportionately shitting up the sub; and transparently serving an alt-right astroturfing agenda under the guise of &quot;concerns about racism&quot;.</p>

<p>It just leaves a really bad taste in the mouth when places like r/The_Donald feel like they can use r/conspiracy as a proxy for their SJW bullshit whenever they like.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In a newspaper that no one here would admit to reading. Do you think she&#39;s gonna start preaching anti-white hatred from her new platform? Yeah, the tweets were dumb and nasty. I won&#39;t get into their context (ie: of her supposedly firing off at trolls), but the freaking out we are seeing over this minority reporter historically tweeting racism against a hegemonic majority (whites) is insincere, disproportionate, and a very calculated move by a group that contains a not-insignificant number of full-blown racists under its own banner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump just admitted to Colluding with a foreign power to gain the presidency. So of course there&#39;s going to be a lot of talk about a writer who said some mean things about white people.</p>

<p>You know, for as much as &quot;both sides are the same&quot; talk that goes around here, these kind of brigades always seem to help the party that&#39;s pushes for Tax breaks for the rich and not the opposition party. </p>

<p>What do you mean “just admitted”? Trump’s morbid Zionism, his unconditional support for the Likud, and his (and his family’s ties) to the messianic sect Chabad Lubavitch have been known for a long time.</p>

<p>Also, you can <em>say the name</em>, you don’t have to call Israel a “foreign power”. And again, its meddling in the US political system is a well-established fact, and it is not new. Everyone knows you don’t become US president if you aren’t ready to bow in Jersualem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The growing push of anti-white racism in recent years, coupled with the growing push of black supremacy, has led to a rapid degradation of race relations in the western world. This is highly detrimental to society, and I would consider it to be a &quot;very real problem&quot;.</p>

<p>Lyme is a serious disease that is systematically disregarded by the mainstream. There are countless thousands of people out there right now who are disabled by this disease and don&#39;t even know they have it, or that it can be treated. I would also consider this to be a &quot;very real problem&quot;.</p>

<p>Incidentally, this post of yours already has more karma than every single Lyme post except for one. Color me suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it is not!! OMFG I am about to have a fucking stroke !! This is insane !! Things like using the officially designated email server matter within the construct of a system that operates within the confines of a legally binding framework of rules and laws that are respected by all and all are subject to them.</p>

<p>9/11 and the aftermath proved that framework of rules and laws does not exist for these people!! But oh well at least we can still get Clinton for her email. NO WE CANT !! We cannot get Bush or Cheyne or Rumsfeld for crimes against humanity !! These are convicted war criminals and terrorists !! Guilty of mass murder, torturing prisoners, treason against the United States and we can do nothing !! What is it about this you and others like you do not understand?? We have no democracy or government anymore!! We have only a criminal mafiosa in charge and they will do what ever the hell they want!!</p>
