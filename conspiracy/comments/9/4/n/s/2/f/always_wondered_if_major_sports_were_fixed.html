    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m a humongous Minnesota Vikings fan &amp; some of the absolute horseshit officiating I&#39;ve seen in their games (and their total disappearances/playing opposite of how they played all year beforehand) leads me to believe somewhere in the past they pissed off someone that it&#39;s a secret law they must be screwed over in one way or another when they get anywhere/play anyone important.</p>

<p>I think big moneymaker sports are always able to be rigged, but i have no way to prove it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have, &amp; there are plenty of things that are pure bullshit, but unless someone in the league office or a referee comes out to state they were specifically made to fuck a team over, it cant be unequivocally proven.</p>

<p>If I had a computer I would download old games or YouTube videos of game highlight/breakdowns and be able to prove my point that the NFL has fucked the Vikings a multitude of times, but its still moot until someone with gravitas in the league can back me up.</p>

<p>(Im sure there are plenty of other teams too, namely anyone who plays the Patriots/Packers/Steelers getting blatantly fucked, but I pretty much only watch Vikings games)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually have a rather large sports blog, and a large portion of it is rigged sporting events of one flavor or another.</p>

<p>Hence, I disagree with your first statement -- you just have to watch and use common sense.  The Jesse James &quot;catch&quot; fiasco last year is a prime example.  Even by the rules they had last year, how would that not be a catch?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, and the Vikings had a similar issue when they played the Packers in Lambeau in 2010 I believe it was, where their TE clearly caught the ball for a TD and was clearly in bounds, but it was ruled incomplete (i think because he went out of bounds after the fact and didnt maintain &quot;full control&quot;) and later on the Packers TE caught the ball and the FIRST part of his body to touch the ground was his ASS clearly out the back of the end zone, but was ruled a TD and the Pukers won by 7. </p>

<p>These things happen all the time, and yeah, each team has the rest of the game to make up for a missed (or blatantly ignored/phantom) call, but those plays aren&#39;t proof in and of themselves to people.</p>

<p>An actual statement by a referee or league officials is one of the only ways to legitimately prove its rigged.</p>

<p>In the scenario I&#39;m talking about, I&#39;m absolutely correct . Call it salty if you like, but the Pack are frequently helped along by referees.</p>

<p>Just look at this year and their crybaby QB getting special rules because his dumbass broke his own collarbone &amp; his team &amp; coach getting exposed as a 1 man show LOL</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The grading for the officials is also a tightly kept secret, which doesn&#39;t mean anything on its own, but when blatantly biased officials like Pete Morelli are still allowed to officiate after the bullshit he allowed in the 09 NFCCG, its obvious that a fuck up is a fuck up to the public, but a pat on the back (and more) in private.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, I don&#39;t think any player/coach would be able to be in on it, unless there is some crazy black mail shit going on, but than I look at the Vikings again and they just fucking disappeared this year in Filthadelphia so who knows..

<p>Me too. I wasn&#39;t a fan of his signing to be honest, but if they can win 13 games with Case friggen Keenum they should be able to win much more with a more accurate, stronger armed Cousins.</p>

    <div class="md"><h2>From a previous post</h2>

<p>Several posters on this sub have mentioned that professional sports is nothing more preplanned athletic performance utilized by TPTB to entertain and distract citizens from the problems of their home and their world (Circus and Peanuts). While I don’t doubt that collegiate and professional sports are influenced by unseen powerful forces, there is down to earth evidence to suggest that many of these games in some way or another are compromised if not rigged.</p>

<p>To understand this, one must recognize these three critical factors:</p>

<p>1) Gambling in sports is an ongoing phenomenon.</p>

<p>Not an earth shattering revelation for many sports fans. Just look at how much money is made in legal gambling (i.e. fantasy sports): well over a billion dollars. I guarantee that the amount of cash wagered illegally dwarves this. However, when people think of sports gambling they believe it is only perpetrated by the audience. The truth is that not only do the athletes regularly gamble (in their sports and other leagues), coaches, managers, referees, higher ups in the League(s), and even team owners engage in this act.</p>

<p>Don’t believe me? From “The Fix is In” by Brian Touhy:</p>

<p>“A pertinent fact the NFL blatantly overlooks as part of its historical development is that several of its early team owners were well-known gamblers. The New York Giant’s original owner Tim Mara (whose family still owns the team) had a history as a bookmaker before and even during his ownership of the team. He wasn’t alone.</p>

<p>Another original owner whose family still has control of its franchise, Charles Bidwell bought the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals) after relinquishing his share in George Halas’ Chicago Bears. Bidwell was not just a gambler and a racetrack owner; he was a known associate of Al Capone (they shared the same lawyer, Ed O’Hare) and a bootlegger.</p>

<p>Beloved Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney, Sr. was another big time gambler who reportedly won over $250,000 over a two-day span at the racetrack. Rooney would also own pieces in several horse and dog racing tracks and reportedly hired head coach Joe Bach to work off a gambling debt he couldn’t immediately pay off.</p>

<p>George “Dick” Richards was known to be a heavy gambler outside of his car dealership when he purchased and NFL team, moving them to Detroit to become the Lions. In letters he had foolishly written, Richards detailed how he bet on his own team’s games, including upwards of $50,000 on a single content prior to selling the Lions in 1948.”</p>

<p>2) The Mafia/Mob have their hands in sports gambling.</p>

<p>Once again, not really surprising that the Mafia/Mob would have their hands deep into a elicit activity that generates billions of dollars yearly. Whether it is directly or indirectly, they regularly interact with the employees of the sporting world and several of the higher-ups in the league may have some type of business arrangement with these mobsters. If you interested in this particularly topic, I suggest that you read up on former mobster Michael Franzese.</p>

<p>3) If your gamble consistently, it is easy to get in debt.</p>

<p>For these athletes, coaches, refs and owners who gamble, at some point in their life they will amass serious debt (for owners and players, millions of dollars in debt). If they can’t pony up the cash, there are other ways to make up for it: whether it is point shaving (asked to score a certain number of points), flat out throw the game, or (as an owner) purposely handicap their team.</p>

<p>You might be wondering how those associated with these players do not call them out or try to remove them from the teams. Most likely, the other members/employees of the team are as gambling (but not in debt) and/or engage in other elicit behaviors. Exposing their teammates puts them at risk at being exposed. We’ve seen this documented in the movie industry, politics, and corporate culture. Is it really unreasonable to expect the same in multi-billion dollar sporting ventures? Ventures that our too big to fail?</p>

<p>Does that mean that every professional player gambles or is doing something illegal? No.</p>

<p>I do believe that there are athletes who not only avoid gambling but live fairly clean lifestyles. The reason they don’t speak out is that they would put themselves in the crosshairs of powerful sport leagues that have enough resources and power to blacklist and destroy their reputation. The more damning concern however is they soon must deal with the mafia/mob: entities that have no quarrels of putting these players and their family on hit lists. Disclosing to the public the art of game fixing will inadvertently open average citizens to these criminal organizations and that’s something that cannot be allowed. No player will ever put the lives of themselves or their family on the line for this, and can you really blame them.</p>

<p>Serious questions for those reading: If you had verifiable paperwork that linked violent criminal parties to professional sports leagues that are complicit in illegal gambling, would you release it to the public aware of the consequences and the forces you will reckon with?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, have to correct one point:  You CAN bet on a winner, called the &quot;Money Line&quot;.  It usually is expressed in units comparable to a $100 bet.</p>

<p>If you are betting a favorite who is -200, you must bet $200 to win $100.</p>

<p>If you are betting an underdog at +200, you bet $100 to win $200.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hey guys, it&#39;s Stefan &quot;Yellow&quot; Curry. You may know me in this timeline as &quot;Steph Curry&quot; but in the Wasardi timeline (don&#39;t ask, will explain in whole post when world is ready) I am known as Stefan &quot;Yellow&quot; Curry. In my timeline, the people have taken over government in a way that it cannot be corrupted and we do not have corrupted sports anymore. Everything is well regulated but we don&#39;t have politicians. Technology has made this possible. Anyways, the only way to fix your problem in your timeline is to get rid of your politicians because they are useless and it is SUCH a thing in the past. Politicians in a few hundred years will be as foreign and crazy sounding as slavery in the former United States was. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve put this in a few posts but some criminals recently caught match fixing have explained that they no longer need to bribe players, they just bribe the refs. 5, 10 or 18 players to bribe is difficult but 1-3 refs isnt. Games where teams are 50/50 and u bribe the refs, all of a sudden the odds are well in your favour. This isn&#39;t foolproof but just like counting cards, the odds are now stacked in your favour and long term profit is guaranteed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And the better if the game isn&#39;t as of high profile.  (Though this may not apply if, like last year&#39;s playoffs, the league decides to make the questionable officiating decisions part of the storyline!)</p>
