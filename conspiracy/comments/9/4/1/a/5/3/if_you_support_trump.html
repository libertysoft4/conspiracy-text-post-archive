    <div class="md"><p>Fair question. </p>

<p>But it is a small part tied to a large act (NDAA). Also the executive branch does not make laws. Not making excuses just stating some facts. The extreme media propaganda has opened the eyes of a lot of people that wouldn&#39;t have understood otherwise. So in a way Trump has taught america how it has been manipulated over the years.  </p>

<p>Maybe he is letting everyone dig a deep enough hole to bury themselves. </p>

<p>But in all reality I do not think the rogue intelligence agencies really need a law changed to infiltrate the media and push propaganda. They would do it regardless. </p>

<p>First, the act was passed by a GoP Congress, and they remain in power. The chances of a repeal arriving on his desk are slim until Democrats take the chambers.</p>

<p>At what point do you realize Obama, like Trump plays the game of opposition?  Obama also ran on single payer, and according to his supporters fought for it, but failed, and instead we got Romney Care... I mean Obama care.  Then Trump and the republicans pretends their going to get rid of it, but It&#39;s a Republican&#39;s wet dream.

<p>When it comes to over reaching power grabs by the government, the president will always &quot;fail&quot; to stop it.  Kind of like how Trump reauthorized FISA while at the sametime the entire right were point to It&#39;s abuses against Trump.  It&#39;s all theatrics when it comes to erode our civil liberties, let companies walk all over us, and have the MIC brain wash us through media.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The answer is simple.</p>

<p>First, it&#39;s an act not an EO. The act was passed by a GoP Congress, and they remain in power. The chances of a repeal arriving on his desk are slim until Democrats take the chambers.</p>

<p>Secondly, Obama thought tooth and nail, threatening to veto the act but bowed down under pressure. He failed, and Trump always goes opposite of what Obama did. Thus on principle Trump will not repeal the act.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the act gives authority to the President, CIA Director, and Secretary of State to dictate any propaganda. How often do those in power give up thier power?</p>

<p>Oh this is wholly political. And you&#39;ve been misled to think Obama was the reason for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was a Congressional law passed in a Republican controlled congress attached to a necessary funding bill. Not something that was directed by Obama.  </p>

<p>Considering the Congressional leadership during Obama Presidency, perhaps if he had said he wanted it they would have blocked it since that is what they bragged about constantly, blocking anything Obama requested. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>that one is actually incredibly easy to answer. If your enemy has an advantage over you, and you suddenly have the opportunity to seize that advantage and use hpit against him, then you should do exactly that. </p>

<p>That fucker through out the rule book the moment he legalized propaganda against US citizens. In fact, before that Operation Mockingbird was working that way anyway! Then, you take a look at who is working for CNN (Clapper, Brennan) which makes you realize that these clowns never planned to play fair in the first place. There are probably many more agents working alongside them and Trump is going to need every advantage he can get to stop them. </p>
