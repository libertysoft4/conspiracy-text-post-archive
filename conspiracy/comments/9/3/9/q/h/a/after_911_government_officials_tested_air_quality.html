<p>The city allowed people to return to Manhattan after the collapse of the World Trade Center towers even though officials were told the air was not yet safe, according to an internal memo from a New York City Health Department official. &quot;EPA officials were aware of the severity of danger at Ground Zero in contrast to their public statements at the time.&quot; NYC allowed people to return after the collapse of the towers because the mayor&#39;s office was under pressure from business owners to open more of the &quot;red zone.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060921070536/http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/09/07/nyc.air/index.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20060921070536/http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/09/07/nyc.air/index.html</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of details about how incompetent and evil some officials were about failing to inform the emergency workers and the surrounding public about the dangers of toxic dust after the government knew full well that it was extremely toxic: <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/new-docs-detail-how-feds-downplayed-ground-zero-health-risks">Records obtained by a New York worker-safety group describe how officials in the Bush administration as well as federal agencies removed health warnings and misrepresented test results on air quality</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>At least 1,000 people – and probably many more – have died often lingering, painful deaths resulting from illnesses related to their exposure to debris that spread from the wreckage of the World Trade Center towers in downtown Manhattan. More than 37,000 are officially recognised as sick.</p>

<p>“Within the next five years we will be at the point where more people have died from World Trade Center-related illnesses than died from the immediate impact of the attacks,” said Dr Jim Melius, a doctor at the New York State Laborers Union <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/9-11-illnesses-death-toll">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/9-11-illnesses-death-toll</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Pretty soon we will have 3,000 dead from the attack and 3,000 dead because of this government lie about safe air, but please tell me more about how the government wouldn&#39;t kill their own people.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t an online link or a scientific article, but if you&#39;re interested in Chernobyl at all, you should read &quot;Voices from Chernobyl&quot; (available in pdf form <a href="http://teachfreespeech.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/VOICES_FROM_CHERNOBYL.pdf">here</a>), which features interviews with all sorts of people who worked in or lived around the plant. It discusses a lot there what the &quot;regular&quot; people were told and how workers would get sick and die from radiation poisoning. It&#39;s disturbing but very interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you&#39;d have to take the iodine very early on in the emergency and at a very specific time with regard to the amount leaked.</p>

<p>Considering the government&#39;s first (and second and third and...) move is to lie about what&#39;s happening and what&#39;s being released, by the time anyone knew to take the iodine, it would be too late.</p>

<p>But, as you said, they provide <em>some</em> illusion of safety.</p>

<p>..except for this one.

<p>If this ever were proven to be a false flag 100% without a doubt, the amount of damage done would stretch generations...no wonder it’s gotta be played so close to the chest of these government officials.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember reading somewhere that there was a point where the specialists called in said that the building wasn’t safe and might collapse, but instead of evacuating they told everyone to stay in their offices and even stationed security to keep them from leaving <sup>citation needed</sup> .</p>

<p>The reason was that they knew there was almost 20,000 people in the building, and they didn’t want them clogging the streets of lower Manhattan making it impossible for first responders to do their job. </p>

<p>Ignoring the immense irony of that statement, and whether it was their true motivation or not, it does make me wonder what the logistics of evacuation Manhattan island — or part of it — would be. Say the air isn’t safe to breathe ... people try to leave. How long does it take? How many people would it take trying to leave at once before everything jams up and no one can get anywhere? How many more people would die in this process?</p>

<p>I have no clue what the answer to this thought experiment is. Maybe someone smarter than me can make a guess. </p>

<p>Worthy also to note that among rescue workers <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/11/health/911-cancer-treatment/">cancers are not predominantly of the lungs</a> (which negates the shill-argument firefighters get sick because they &quot;inhaled a lot of ash&quot; on 911). </p>

<p>We are rather seeing <a href="http://nypost.com/2014/07/27/cancers-among-ground-zero-workers-skyrocketing/">prostate, thyroid, leukemia and multiple myeloma.</a></p>

<p>Firefighters know how to deal with &quot;ash&quot;. That&#39;s basically their job. They have masks. They had nothing to protect them however against the high level of radiation at ground zero that day (and that continued for weeks/months thereafter). That&#39;s why they&#39;re falling ill, and why their symptoms/ailments are congruent with the hypothesis of radiation exposure. </p>

<p>The term &quot;ground zero&quot; had no other definition at the time than being the site of an atomic blast. Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/Lec9giab90I?t=14m1s">this</a>, or read Khalezov&#39;s book linked in the video description, if you&#39;re interested in the hypothesis of a nuclear demotion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just watched a vid showing pictures of the cavities underneath where the towers stood. Smooth, rounded and marble-like in texture. All swirled together. There is no way in hell nano thermite can get hot enough to do this to bedrock. I’ve always kept an open mind to the possibility of nukes being used, but now more than ever I’m convinced. Of course we still see thermite charges before they collapsed. The question is whether they were used in conjunction with the nukes, or just as a distraction for the masses to bite on in the years to come. The think tanks that pulled this off know what they’re doing. This post will get downvoted of course because it’s forbidden to discuss this angle here, but if you look at what happened to the bedrock underneath the towers, it is pretty obvious. </p>

<p>9/11 was a brilliant scheme, most probably something to do with alerting those who pay attention to the <strong>absurdity</strong> of the media.</p>

<p>It was just staged, a straightforward smoke and mirrors act. What actually happened on 9/11 was absolutely mundane by comparison. A controlled demolition in a cordoned off section of downtown Manhattan, dressed up via the magic of the controlled media to be the 9/11 we all know and love.</p>

<p>There are numerous accounts of evacuation drills of various kinds happening that morning. Of course, few people would recall such details clearly given the events that transpired...</p>

<p>September Clues remains the best documentary dealing with the comprehensive co-ordinated media fakery that was required to pull off 9/11. I always recommend the <a href="http://fakeologist.com/september-clues-tour-guide/">Tour Guide</a> as the best way to watch it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is the source for all of these claims? Can you verify the source? Has anyone verified it?</p>

<p>If it’s a government agency, or mainstream media... then it’s unreliable pish.</p>

<p>All of the evidence presented to the public arrived via the very same channels that broadcast the laughably fake live plane strike video clips, and which later broadcast various “amateur footage” clips, all of which tie back to people in the media.</p>

<p>None of the evidence is trustworthy, all of it is likely fabricated or tampered with. Watch September Clues. The video evidence is a proven forgery beyond any reasonable doubt. The same is true for all the photos of “toasted cars” and whatnot, which gradually trickled into the mainstream media long after the event itself had unfolded.</p>

<p>The rock I can explain though. All of Manhattan looks like that, if you visit Central Park you can see more examples just like it. I’ve personally verified it with my own eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone was watching TV, or the first damaged tower. Almost nobody was paying attention to the tower without the gaping hole and flames, and what they could see was a (literal) smokescreen anyway.</p>

<p>If you want to surprise yourself, look into the number of verified “eyewitnesses” who are on record as having seen and/or heard a plane. Look at the initial video clips of people on the street which never aired a second time. They refer to an “explosion”, not a plane.</p>

<p>Nobody actually saw any planes hit anything on 9/11 because it didn’t happen, that was only on the TV screens.</p>

<p>A bunch of empty towers in a secure,cordoned off and fully evacuated area of downtown Manhattan were brought down in a conventional controlled demolition under cover of military smokescreens. The rest is all fairy tales and nonsense.</p>

In the 60s and 70s it seems they had a more open mind about nukes and I saw a funny picture showing the usefulness of nukes.

I say simple, because the psychopath is a subset of what all of us could be. It&#39;s just a self-serving machine deficient in empathy and emotions. If we just look past our emotions and concerns for others and see the world as gain and loss for ourselves exclusively, we perceive in the way they do. It takes mental and emotional work for us to suppress our better parts, but  it&#39;s natural for these self-serving robots.</p>

<p>So, we do poorly at detecting these beings and their machinations, because they play a game of manipulation chess all day every day with others while we try to get along with them in balance. In order to overcome these predictable self-serving machines, we have to predict them and that takes mental and emotional work to an extent. </p>
