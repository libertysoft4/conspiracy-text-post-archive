        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Think about it.</p>

<p>It was the weirdest thing. </p>

<p>People were rallying all over without fact checking anything. Plastering cities with posters. All the YouTubers telling their fans about it. </p>

<p>And one of the most memorable facts about the whole thing was the organizer getting arrested for drunken public masturbating. In my experience, whenever KONY 2012 comes up, it&#39;s always one of the first things acknowledged -- &quot;Kony 2012? .....Oh yeah! Wasn&#39;t that the thing where the organizer guy got arrested for masturbating or somethin?&quot; is usually how that starts. </p>

<p>Anyway. Randomly remembered it when I found an old Cards Against Humanity holiday gift sticker collection thing. And then thought about how the next election was dominated by that kinda stuff.... Weird...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I low key think that the shift on reddit from cats to dogs, specifically pitbulls, is a demonstration by a marketing/idea shaping group.</p>

<p>Look, we can manipulate these idiots bring dangerous animals into their homes, maim, traumatize, kill their existing pets and family members, and then defend them to anyone who speaks sense. We&#39;ve demonstrated results on this issue, more than online. People now bring their &quot;emotional support&quot; pits to grocery stores, restaurants, anywhere in public, exposing vulnerable people and blaming them when something goes wrong. And everyone else is too afraid to even speak out. What do you think we can do for your candidate? Your company? Your dangerous product? We&#39;ll have consumers begging for it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a powerful selling point.</p>

<p>Imagine if they&#39;d done it with bobcats? Large reptiles? </p>

<p>People are so pliable. It takes so little to make them feel like part of a group and take up the cause.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recommend watching the documentary &quot;Century of the Self&quot; to get an idea about this stuff (advertising psychology and PR). I can commiserate with you regarding your opening statement; the idea that insanely subtle, inconsequential cultural pushes can actually do <strong>anything</strong> is personally hard for me to believe as well but remember that you or I are not everyone. Any idea implemented throughout a society may only be properly understood by accepting we are on a bell curve and an advertising technique that doesn&#39;t work on you simply means you&#39;re not in the &#39;target audience&#39;.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason so much goddamn money is spent on perfecting tiny advertising details to trigger <strong>the average</strong> American&#39;s baser instincts, it&#39;s because it works.</p>

<p>I recommend never using the logic &quot;this wouldn&#39;t work on me so who would be stupid enough to think it could work?&quot;, it&#39;s myopic and silly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that there is something to this theory. The Invisible Children folks came to my college in late 2010 or early 2011, and there were a few students, older and non-traditional who made comments. </p>

<p>Those students were pretty much like &quot;it sounds like you&#39;re trying to put boots on the ground in another part of the world when we&#39;re already stretched thin.&quot; Most of the younger and more social media entrenched students booed the question. The answer from the IC presenters was a boilerplate answer about doing what&#39;s right and such.</p>

<p>Roughly a year later and Kony 2012 was trending like wildfire. I remember that incident because the older student who made the objection was a real piece of work, but he had a point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When oil executives announced the discovery of the largest onshore oil reserves in the Lake Albert region of Uganda in July 2009, the landlocked, oft-neglected East African nation of Uganda went from relative obscurity to a key partner for multi-national oil conglomerates.</p>

<p>Although buoyed by the news, the people of Uganda were naturally cautious, having seen how oil finds in Nigeria and Angola have brought more violence, bloodshed and instability than peace or prosperity.</p>

<p>These worst fears of Ugandans were lent further credence late last year, when President Obama announced he would be deploying US troops on the ground in Uganda, ostensibly to help capture Joseph Kony, the charismatic leader of a small rebel force that has been accused of murders, rapes and kidnaps in Uganda for decades. The timing of the deployment, however, coming at the exact same time as accusations that some of the highest officials in the Ugandan government were guilty of accepting bribes from international oil companies, only further confirmed that the deployment had less to do with Kony, an elusive figure who in fact left Uganda six years ago, and more to do with the securing of American oil interests.</p>

<p>They played a slideshow of people who have already donated and sponsored and it was just riddled with, well let&#39;s just say, &#39;western elitist&#39; companies and organizations.
