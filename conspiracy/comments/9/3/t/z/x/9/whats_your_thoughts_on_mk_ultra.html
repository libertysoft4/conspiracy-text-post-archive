        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’ve been interested in this CIA project for years, so in terms of what I believe I very much believe that MK ultra is still running but just more technologically advanced in terms.</p>

<p>I also think that the summer of love was a CIA experiment in which they tested how well drugs like LSD, acid and weed have a affect on a big population.</p>

<p>When frank Olson died from jumping from a high rise hotel room in New York on the year of 1953 I believe he was largely under the influence of lsd, but instead of throwing in self out of the window he was pushed/thrown because of how much sensitive information he was tied up with and knew about.</p>

<p>Also the prison “Guantanamo bay” where members of “al qaeda” and the “taliban” were held have had a few whistleblowers about the treatment while they were in captivity there, but I could also say the’re could be a link between studying behaviour and psychological activity while on drugs, in your opinion would you say they are still continuing with the project mk ultra?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree there was and could still be a program involved in administering psychotropic or hallucinogenic drugs and studying the effects, especially for interrogation purposes, and even dabbling in whatever &quot;mind control&quot; they are able to really achieve through mental conditioning or whatever.</p>

<p>But the idea that you can really mind control someone Zoolander style, like trigger them into committing murder or whatever, in my opinion is largely overblown, fictionalized, possible scare tactics. Many conspiracy theorists tend to think that the government possesses technology and tactics as far advanced as science fiction would suggest, but I personally do not fall into that camp and think it unlikely that a human can be controlled like a puppet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you however with enough propaganda and phychological warfare tactics and little patriotism it can turn the simplest person into killing and engaging in murder and torture for a little bit of honour.</p>

<p>The topic that I can’t believe is why frank Olson magically fell from the 53 floor of a ny hotel while yes under the influence of lsd but I can’t believe that he would do that.</p>

<p>Yeah, in the movies and in people&#39;s imaginations. You need more than that, you need the magical ability to control a person&#39;s actions. I&#39;m open to evidence that this is a thing, but in my experience people cannot be used as avatars. Hypnotism is for show.</p>

<p>But they can&#39;t pick a specific perso at random and have them commit murder and do all that you question... Zoolander style </p>

<p>What they can do however is create a tribe that fosters those wanted actions, and provides needs (like being in a tribe or something, as well as benefits in life) and as people join, they are willing to do those actions to be part of, and advance within this tribe/family/club/gang/cult/etc..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Monarch programming is what is done in the Entertainment World.</p>

<p><a href="https://vigilantcitizen.com/hidden-knowledge/origins-and-techniques-of-monarch-mind-control/">https://vigilantcitizen.com/hidden-knowledge/origins-and-techniques-of-monarch-mind-control/</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s basically the same, just not done by the govt. Warning, after you read the website above, you will never be able to see a butterfly in art, film, and media, outside of nature shows, without getting uncomfortable ever again. Monarch refers to the butterfly.</p>

<p>If the Kingsman 2 movie, which was god awful, the Mr. Darcy character has lost his memories and lives in a white, padded room, in which he has drawn butterflies all over the wall.  There is a flashback to his past, when he was training to become a Kingsman, and there is a butterfly collection in a glass box on the wall. </p>

<p>The whole Kingsman training is basically Monarch programming. Strip a person of his or her identity through purposeful, but pointless trauma, until they will do whatever you want them to. Everyone gets a puppy at the beginning and the final test is shooting the dog you&#39;ve raised since a pup. If you don&#39;t, no Kingsman for you. The sole point is trauma to sever one from any bonds other than those the handler wants you to have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Explain in detail how you are being targeted. Nobody in the general public is going to draw enough attention to warrant specific targeting by the esoteric. You can make valid points all day about the major deception coming from these hierarchies but at the end of the day you just look like any other raving lunatic even if you are speaking the truth. Only when you become a figure capable of obtaining a decent following and swaying their beliefs will you ever be targeted by the powers that be, and even then you won&#39;t even know it until you drop dead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, I don&#39;t believe you. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve provided no evidence aside from a blatant display of pretentious attitude with a vague description of an event because you lack detail in your fictional narrative. A lot of folks that start scratching the surface of the, for lack of a better word, &#39;Illuminati&#39; seem to go through a phase of self-importance bordering a phophet-like mindset as if they are now being confronted at every turn in life for having a better understanding of what&#39;s actually happening in reality. </p>

<p>Could these corrupt people have Intel on who is &#39;awake&#39;? Sure. Could they use frequencies to affect certain people? Absolutely. Would they use those tactics when there is no sign of a legitimate threat or rebellion against their tyranny? No. There are currently only people whining about certain agendas being orchestrated. Why would they be using silent weapons on an average joe internet warrior when they could just implant disinformation agents to deter them? I guarantee there are even shills in this reddit making ridiculous claims just to sully the movement, if you even want to call it that. </p>

<p>People on here still post about Joe Rogan, Alex Jones, B.o.B, Eric Dubay, A Call For An Uprising, etc. The idolatry is sickening. Don&#39;t ever take anyone&#39;s word and run with it. Someone like RichieFromBoston makes a video about 5G and targeted individuals and people like you eat it up and feel special when you get a headache. Pay attention to these truthseekers you watch and you&#39;ll notice a lot of them have been on the news before. ODDTV, RFB, Optimiztiq, etc. No truthseeker in their right mind would ever trust or visit a news station for any reason at all. And if you still trust even the local news stations whom are affiliated with the MSM, then I just wasted my time typing this. I have a family member that works for our news station here and they would get shut down if they didn&#39;t parrot certain news stories. Look into the Sinclair incident if you need an example. </p>

<p>Although I might seem a bit harsh, I&#39;m just sick of seeing people act the way you do when they start opening their minds.</p>
