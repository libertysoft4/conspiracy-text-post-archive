<p>Here is Sarah Ruth Ashcraft tweet:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/saraashcraft/status/950390742945591296?lang=en">https://twitter.com/saraashcraft/status/950390742945591296?lang=en</a></li>
</ul>

<p>... among several others.</p>

<p>If my name was worth billion$ (like Tom Hanks&#39;™ brand name), my lawyer$ would be suing the SHIT out of Sarah Ruth Ashcraft for libel -- if for no other reason than to clear my name of said salaciousness!</p>

<p>Why is Tom Hanks™ allowing this salaciousness to stand???</p>

<p>Anyone care to speculate?</p>

<p>Every person deserves the right to be heard and the benefit of the doubt when it comes to abuse allegations. 
But the #MAGA on her bio page, automatically makes me suspicious, so until more come out with accusing him of this, and/or we get an actual explanation as to why she is saying this.</p>

<p>yikes - a slightly creepy request, but... she goes into sufficient detail for me:</p>

<p>This is me at 13, the age I was when @tomhanks purchased me from my father for sex as a dissociated #mindcontrol doll. I wonder how much he paid? I wonder how much $$$ my father made for breaking my mind &amp; selling my child body throughout my life. Will I ever get to know?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was in Birmingham, Mi. I was 13. My father was there, he triggered me into dissociation, a 4 yr old alter groomed for sex/prostitution was brought out. I sat on Tom&#39;s lap like a 4 yr old child as he spoke sweetly to me like a child.</p>

<p>Colin was there, but I don&#39;t know what happened to him. It seems he went with my father while Tom was with me. Again, I don&#39;t have the whole memory reconstructed yet. Which is why I wasn&#39;t going to talk about it. But Tom&#39;s running his mouth of on a self righteous soap box, so...</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ve stated all of the details I am comfortable sharing at the moment. I am more than willing to speak with law enforcement in greater detail at any time, as I have made abundantly clear.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So has she actually spoken to law enforcement or just tweeted about it? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;They know what all of this looks like &amp; how memory reconstruction works.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could she be setting herself up with an out here, mentioning memory reconstruction now so if shit hits the fan later she can claim she had false memories due to therapy, interrogations, drugs, crazy dreams, her father&#39;s abuse, whatever?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It seems he went with my father while Tom was with me. Again, I don&#39;t have the whole memory reconstructed yet. Which is why I wasn&#39;t going to talk about it. But Tom&#39;s running his mouth of on a self righteous soap box, so...&quot;</p>

<p>This kinda a tough one. On one hand I feel for her if true, but she shouldn&#39;t let Hank&#39;s alleged hypocrisy dictate how she calls him out. If he did it once he&#39;ll likely do it again so call him out to save the next victim if nothing else. Besides, he&#39;s one of the World&#39;s most beloved actors and he doesn&#39;t deserve the fame and fortune if this is true.</p>

<p>I have no dog in this fight, mostly just playing devil&#39;s advocate. I really don&#39;t know much about this story though so just spitballing. That being said, is it possible this lady is a crazy stalker and that maybe Hank&#39;s was advised not to encourage her? Also, it&#39;s certainly not completely out of the relm of possibility that she was maybe fishing him and the metoo movement to see if her tweets got any traction before proceeding with a law suit of her own wether genuine or just a scam. Idk what to think about the fact her claims have not taken hold while so many others have over the last year.</p>
