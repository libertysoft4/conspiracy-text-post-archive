        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have no doubt that this place is brigaded and astroturfed.  It’s pretty obvious.  And i’m not going to name sides.  </p>

<p>Here’s what I don’t get.  The only person I talk to in real life (and that includes real life people on Facebook) that takes Reddit seriously is my wife, and she only knows this place exists because of me.  Other than gaming forums and other niche interest groups (sports team, advice on any practical subject), I dont really think many people are either here or actually belive this website is anything more than entertainment.  </p>

<p>I have die hard political supporters on all sides, friends that are conspiracy buffs, and they’ve never heard of this sub and don’t use this site.  Even people the wife and I have met through certain subs for our swinging endeavors think this site is silly.lnand only use it as a last resort to procure sex at the last minute when flaked on.  Literally everyone I talk to has:  (1) never heard of Reddit; (2) has heard about it but never uses it because it’s a weird teenager thing (I’m 37 btw), or (3) uses it for gardening or other practical interest tips.</p>

<p>Which leads me to this...why are the masterminds behind the astroturfing even bothering?  They aren’t changing the minds of people who are here organically, and I highly doubt that most “normies” are going to change their minds even if they wander to this sub.  Because the CIA labelled “conspiracy theories” as crackpottery after JFK, I would put good money on the fact that most normies avoid this place even if they stumble upon it because they were conditioned to belive that we are all raving mad.  </p>

<p>Which begs the question - is Soros’/Russian money well invested here?  I can’t imagine it is.  The only people in this sub are people so interested in Conspiracy stuff we’d be labelled lunatics by everyon in our lives (no opinions being changed here), and shills.  I honestly don’t get it.  </p>

<p>They should be fired, because their tactics are obvious to anyone paying attention (which organic users of this sub do very well).  But maybe not - my wife has watched exposes on how Supermakets use strategic product placement, and, knowing this, will still make impulse buys.

<p>That remark was directed at this website in general. Much of the profit is derived from advertising revenue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion they are not interested in shutting us down here because they&#39;ve tried that and we just crawl under another rock. And neither is it marketing to sell products. No, their shilling by necessity is a lighter touch and it&#39;s multifaceted. Some of it is still predictable. The JIDF swarms anything negative about Israel. Corporate shills obfuscate about Monsanto/Bayer, etc.</p>

<p>But pay particular attention to the OPs for polical posts. That&#39;s where your value for money is. You can push an agenda simply by calling attention to certain facts and conveniently ignoring others. Similarly you can create tribalism and push people into group-think by pushing divisive issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For those of us that know better, the shills work on different grounds: to make us feel we&#39;re alone, isolated, crazy, ignorable minority.</p>

<p>Anyone that is too busy to verify sources or at least make a solid  foundation for how the world works will be easy to confuse, solely on involuntary ignorance. Raising above that involves reading full pages scattered around the net, most people dont have the drive, mood for devoting that type of time.</p>

<p>Heres a wall of text (the irony) that offers a story-example of how it works:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5rcb3r/the_conspiracy_of_opinions_or_how_the_state_is/">https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5rcb3r/the_conspiracy_of_opinions_or_how_the_state_is/</a></p>

<p>&quot;<em>First, they understand their enemy (the people) can have two very different types of intelligence&quot;</em>:</p>

<p>&quot;<em>Dependent Intelligence: comprises most with university degrees. It manifests as a fact-based erudition, knowing lots of stuff about many things. This intelligence doesn&#39;t depend upon one&#39;s own mind or one&#39;s own senses; these can be delegated to the collective, the identity group. Its level is measured at the linguistic proficiency at repeating and summarizing, in a more or less elaborate or subtle way, what everyone agrees other intelligent people think. These are usually people educated beyond their intelligence (it does that).&quot;</em></p>

<p>&quot;<em>Independent Intelligence: all those who rely on their own eyes and mind to interpret the world. No need to spell it out, as most on this sub belong to that category.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;For the first category, the propaganda is straightforward. From a position of authority, and with nicer words than mine, scream in a loudspeaker: Everyone who thinks bearded acrobatic pilots didn&#39;t pulverize the skyscrapers in New York on 911 is an utter dumb fuck and here is what he looks like. The loudspeaker is the TV. The screaming is daily. The picture shown is that of a lunatic. The dependent thinkers are thus immediately taken care of, as they rely on other people&#39;s minds, and such other minds have spoken. Whether they have private opinions when they&#39;re alone on the toilet nobody knows, and it doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;For the independent thinkers, the goal is otherwise: first, they need to convince us other people are sheep. That&#39;s why they multiply the labels and the categories, and then caricature every label for every other one. That&#39;s also why the shills/tourists are acting as they are. The goal isn&#39;t to convince us we&#39;re wrong, but rather that most others are wrong and idiotic; that we&#39;re alone, confined to a small world of people who question/know the truth.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;This concept is at the heart of the precepts of propaganda; and it also embodies the role of the MSM (and fake polls); not to convince us of anything, but to convince us that others are convinced of something. The MSM is the metaphorical loudspeaker; if it&#39;s been on CNN, everyone knows that everyone knows. It&#39;s a terribly potent weapon.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Think about this: does Apple try to sell us an iPhone by convincing us it&#39;s cool, or by convincing us everyone else thinks it&#39;s cool? Do people buy Nike sneakers because they&#39;re good shoes, or because they think others think they&#39;re good shoes? Answering that question is unnecessary, as we know brands use celebrities to promote their products.&quot;</em></p>

<p>They also have the deceiving capacity to impersonate every preponent in a serious discussion to control the conclusion that is reached. Literally talking to themselves over and over again, sometimes they are caught when switching between accounts ... impersonating both sides of the discussion, sometimes they pretent they are on our side, with the intent of weakening our side of the argument, make it mild, diluting the discussion, or worse, make it sound too crazy, ridiculous --- (see Al3X J0NES or other control oppositon)</p>

<p>Controlling what we are allowed to believe is total control. Besides, they&#39;re in too deep already. </p>

<p>There is also value in creating ideological community mobs that can be triggered to unknowingly brigade for TPTB. The vast majority of shills don&#39;t believe they are shills. They aren&#39;t paid; they are conditioned to respond a certain way to certain ideas that hurt their frailly constructed worldview. </p>

<p>Some of them are literally paid shills, but they undoubtedly come from one of three &quot;networks&quot;: 3rd world country Multi-level marketing firms (Clinton had some of these working for her campaign; they&#39;re usually either just dirt poor and trying to feed themselves or they&#39;ve been exploited within an actual religious cult into doing this), spooks, and hedge fund managers/crypto-currency consultants who utilize forums like this to cause marginal shifts in the state of the market.</p>

<p>is Soros’/Russian money well invested here? I can’t imagine it is. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me say, first of all, that it probably is well-invested here, or else they would have stopped doing it. It&#39;s reasonable to assume these are rational economic actors.</p>

<p>So, starting from that point, why would investing in subterfuge here on reddit, and more specifically in the conspiracy forum, pay off? You say: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have die hard political supporters on all sides, friends that are conspiracy buffs, and they’ve never heard of this sub and don’t use this site. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the beauty part is, they don&#39;t have to use this site to be exposed to the spread of lies. A post here could be the spark that lights a fire which spreads to other social media, gets mainstream press coverage, and eventually becomes a part of our culture that your friends know about even if they never use the internet at all. Undoubtedly some of the people here are &#39;influencers&#39;, people with large social media followings who post frequently and who lean hard in a specific political direction. If I wanted to, for example, smear a political candidate, I could post a &#39;theory&#39; here that they had committed some shocking crime, watch my lie morph into a genuine meme (in the classic meaning of that word, not the &#39;picture with words on it&#39; meaning), and sit back while my useful idiots do the real heavy lifting.</p>

<p>For example, there&#39;s no particular reason why any of your friends should have ever heard of QAnon. But maybe they have now, because in the last twenty-four hours Q has gotten major press coverage, in part because of some people at a Trump rally. <em>Those</em> people probably knew about Q from reddit or 4chan. But now someone&#39;s gramma who never uses the internet is reading about it on newsprint.</p>

<p>That remark was directed at this website in general. Much of the profit is derived from advertising revenue. </p>

<p>“Are we really all this stupid?”</p>

<p>I do not think it is a matter of intelligence. Human psychology has been mapped out and people are exploited because they do not have access to the same level of information.</p>
