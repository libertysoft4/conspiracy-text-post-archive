<h1>Why is the Nephilim (Giants) hidden from modern day archaeology &amp; history?</h1>

<h1>The Nephilim /ˈnɛfɪˌlɪm/ (Hebrew: נְפִילִים‬, nefilim) were the offspring of the &quot;sons of God&quot; and the &quot;daughters of men&quot; before the Deluge, according to Genesis 6:1–4.</h1>

<p>When people began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born to them, the <strong>sons of God</strong> saw that they were fair; and they took wives for themselves of all that they chose. Then the Lord said, “My spirit shall not abide in mortals forever, for they are flesh; their days shall be one hundred twenty years.” The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went in to the daughters of humans, who bore children to them. These were the heroes that were of old, warriors of renown.</p>

<p>— Genesis 6:1–4, New Revised Standard Version</p>

<p>The story of the Nephilim is further elaborated in the <strong>Book of Enoch</strong>. The Greek, Aramaic, and main Ge&#39;ez manuscripts of 1 Enoch and Jubilees obtained in the 19th century and held in the British Museum and Vatican Library, connect the origin of the Nephilim with the <strong>fallen angels</strong>, and in particular with the egrḗgoroi (watchers). Samyaza, an angel of high rank, is described as leading a rebel sect of angels in a descent to earth to have sexual intercourse with human females:</p>

<p>And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days were born unto them beautiful and comely daughters. And the angels, the children of the heaven, saw and lusted after them, and said to one another: &quot;Come, let us choose us wives from among the children of men and beget us children.&quot; And Semjaza, who was their leader, said unto them: &quot;I fear ye will not indeed agree to do this deed, and I alone shall have to pay the penalty of a great sin.&quot; And they all answered him and said: &quot;Let us all swear an oath, and all bind ourselves by mutual imprecations not to abandon this plan but to do this thing.&quot; Then sware they all together and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it. And they were in all two hundred; who descended in the days of Jared on the summit of Mount Hermon, and they called it Mount Hermon, because they had sworn and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon it ...</p>

<p>In this tradition, the children of the Nephilim are called the Elioud, who are considered a separate race from the Nephilim, but they share the fate of the Nephilim.</p>

<h1>ANNUNAKI</h1>

<p>In his 1976 book The Twelfth Planet, Russian-American author Zecharia Sitchin claimed that the <strong>Anunnaki</strong> were actually a race of extraterrestrial beings from the undiscovered planet Nibiru, who came to Earth around 500,000 years ago in order to mine gold. According to Sitchin, the Anunnaki genetically engineered homo erectus to create modern humans to work as their slaves. Sitchin claimed that the Anunnaki were forced to leave Earth when Antarctic glaciers melted, causing the Flood of Noah, which also destroyed the Anunnaki&#39;s bases on Earth. These had to be rebuilt and the <strong>Nephilim</strong>, needing more humans to help in this massive effort, taught them agriculture. Ronald H. Fritze writes that, according to Sitchin, &quot;the Annunaki built the pyramids and all the other monumental structures from around the world that ancient astronaut theorists consider so impossible to build without highly advanced technologies.&quot; Sitchin also claimed that the Anunnaki had left behind human-alien hybrids, some of whom may still be alive today, unaware of their alien ancestry. Sitchin expanded on this mythology in later works, including The Stairway to Heaven (1980) and The Wars of Gods and Men (1985). In The End of Days: Armageddon and the Prophecy of the Return (2007), Sitchin predicted that the <strong>Anunnaki would return to earth</strong>...</p>

<h1>Modern Day Nephilim Conspiracy Theories</h1>

<ol>
<li>U.S. Soldiers Claim To Have Shot &amp; Killed A 12-Foot Giant In Afghanistan</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8yxipy/antartica_conspiracy_theories">Fallen Angels imprisoned in Antartica</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Please let me know of any other modern day Nephilim Conspiracy Theories to add to the list.</p>

<p>Are these just Conspiracy Theories or are they reality? If they&#39;re reality, why is it being covered up -- especially when it would prove the existence of GOD or even extra-terrestrials IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can any learned legend clarify something thats been bothering me lately as i dig deeper into the whole Annunaki/Nephilim sagas and perhaps straight up history? </p>

<p>In particular the distinction of Marduk, as he is both a specific Annunaki figure <em>from</em> Nibiru yet is also referred to <em>as</em> Nibiru...not to mention Mars and Jupiter but thats another story so yeah...what is the go there? Even Sitchin references him both as the planet that destroys Tiamat and as the Annunaki figure from the planet itself. </p>

<p>And even if ones a literal representation and the other a fable, then which is which? Sorry if this sounds rambling and doesnt make sense I gotta look this stuff up more when im not stoned lol...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With regards to Annunaki, Nephilim &amp; Bible, here&#39;s my conjecture from what I&#39;ve learned &amp; pieced together:</p>

<p>Anu, the leader of the Annunaki, is the father of Enki &amp; Enlil.</p>

<p>Enki came to Earth to mine Gold that was needed to repair the atmosphere of their home planet Nibiru.</p>

<p>Enki created Man to help mine the Gold, so technically he can be considered the God in the Bible.</p>

<p>Some Annunaki under the command of  Enki must be Fallen Angels that taught man &amp; slept with the Daughters of Man to create Nephilim.</p>

<p>Enlil was sent by Anu to punish Enki for creating man &amp; to destroy the Nephilim &amp; Man.</p>

<p>Enki helped save some men (such as Noah).</p>

<p>Then Enlil ruled over Man as their God.</p>

<p>So to make sense of this, the final Christian Bible may be a combination of 3 entities into 1 (ie Father, Son &amp; Holy Spirit = Trinity).</p>

<p>---------------------------</p>

<p>OR even more blasphemous:</p>

<p>Enlil threw Enki out of Heaven.</p>

<p>Enki was punished for disobeying his father Anu -- leader of the Annunaki.</p>

<p>This would imply that Enki is now Satan in the Bible.</p>

<p>Christian&#39;s God is Enlil, while Islam&#39;s God is Enki?</p>

<p>The Annunaki will return one day to make things right or enslave us?</p>

<p>---------------------------</p>

<p>Of course, the Bible &amp; Annunaki are most likely completely unrelated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going along with everything Stitchen said about the Annunaki. They wanted to mine more &amp; faster to save the dying atmosphere on their planet.</p>

<p>They most likely had superior tools based on the Ancient Structures they left behind that they created with what was available on Earth. Some of these structures that we can&#39;t duplicate with our own modern tools today.</p>

<p>Enki is the Sumerian god of water, knowledge, mischief, crafts, &amp; creation.</p>

<p>He wasn&#39;t supposed to create Man to help. When the Anu found out about this, he sent Enlil to clean up Enki&#39;s mess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not familiar with the Sumerian sources, but your attempts to line them up with Christian ideas do not work historically (history of ideas) speaking.  The Old Testament was edited into a whole around 600BC, by exiles to Babylon.  The Bible stories you are trying to line up were deliberately written to have these NOT line up.   Babylonian accounts have all these deities, but the Jewish account has precisely 1 deity who was responsible for both Creation and the Flood and for saving righteous men.  </p>

<p>Regarding Satan, his opposite in Jewish traditions is Michael, who is not the creator, but the commander of heaven&#39;s armies. So if you want to line up Enlil and Enki, you can do that very speculatively, but in Jewish traditions, many of the deeds are taken away from them and put on the One God.  Trinity meanwhile is a 1st century development and does not unify these already divergent accounts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ancient Mesopotamian religion was practiced in the civilizations of ancient Mesopotamia, particularly Sumer, Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia from 3500 BC before Christianity.</p>

<p>Many biblical stories that are today found in Judaism, Christianity &amp; Islam were possibly based upon earlier Mesopotamian myths, in particular that of the Creation, Garden of Eden, Great Flood, Tower of Babel, figures such as Nimrod &amp; Lilith and the Book of Esther.</p>

<p>There&#39;s most likely lots of lost knowledge &amp; history that predates Ancient Mesopotamian religion too that was only passed down by spoken word IMO.</p>

<p>There could&#39;ve been aliens &amp; other sentient life on Earth millions of years ago before ELEs wiped them out, over &amp; over again until here we are today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it does make sense that ancient man would worship or treat Fallen Angels &amp; Nephilim like gods. One god like Anu or Enki or Enlil could&#39;ve assumed control over humans &amp; eliminated all other deities.</p>

<p>Exodus 20:3
You shall have no other gods before Me.</p>

<p>Exodus 20:5
You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on their children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me,</p>

<p>Why would GOD be jealous of other gods &amp; deities if they didn&#39;t actually exist, don&#39;t exist &amp; it&#39;s only him?
The &#39;iniquity&#39; means that of the &#39;Fallen Angel&#39; fathers who passed it on to their progeny who were taught to hate God IMO.
Finally, how could &#39;Satan&#39; feel confident enough to start a rebellion &amp; set his throne above &#39;the most high&#39;, if God was all powerful? Why would other Fallen Angels follow him too against a God they could never defeat? It makes no sense IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I know Christians are doing everything to hide or erase Nephilims from the bible. </p>

<p>I was raised as presbyterian fundamentalist, was Christian for decades. Churches don&#39;t teach about titans in the bible, never mention them, if they bump into the Nephilim part, they just ignore it and pretend the verse doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>If I ask about Nephilims, they answer it&#39;s a metaphor for Angels, not actual titans.</p>

<p>I never heard any Christians admit the existence of Titans in the bible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have always been taught about the nephilim and the giants in the Bible you cannot ignore any part of the Bible how else would one read the description of Og of Bashan and that bed and David and Goliath. My church doesn’t shy away from it either however my pastor has a different take on how the appearance of angel human hybrids come back in the end times which seems biblical when researching. </p>

<p>As a Christian the whole story of the Nirubu other planet visitor theory is not something I follow. However I do know my pastor and my grandpa who is 85 (he has spent every day in the Word his whole adult life) they both teach about ancient mythological beings and how they were fallen ones and nephilim. </p>

<p>Do you know the etymology of the word Annunaki?</p>

<p>&quot;Sons of the Shining One&quot;  the name Anu, the Sumerian god of the sun, meant &quot;the shining one&quot;. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh Ra (2) who art shining this night : if there be any one among 
thy followers, let him present himself living as a follower of Thoth&quot;</p>

<p>Because the sun shine&#39;s in the night through the agency of the moon god. </p>

<p>And then later:</p>

<p>&quot;BOOK OF THE DEAD. 283 </p>

<p>The storm of the sky which raises the god, </p>

<p>The hidden one in her dwelling, </p>

<p>Chebt the mummified form of the god. </p>

<p>The greatly beloved, with red hair, </p>

<p>The abundant in life, the veiled one. </p>

<p>Her whose name is powerful in her works, </p>

<p>The bull of the cows. </p>

Him who goes round and piloteth the double earth, the good </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t read it all but at first glance, another Conspiracy Theory pops up:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Japanese-Jewish common ancestry theory (JJCAT)  </p>

<p>The first Japanese-Jewish common ancestry theory was not the brainchild of a Japanese or a Jew but of a Scot named Norman McLeod ... McLeod explained that he was publishing the present volume in anticipation of that magnum opus, which would improve upon Kaempfer&#39;s work by giving &quot;a more accurate and detailed account of the origin of the Japanese, with a description of their Jewish belongings.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Engelbert Kaempfer was a &quot;<strong>German&quot;</strong> naturalist, physician, and explorer writer known for his tour of Russia, Persia, India, South-East Asia, and Japan between 1683 and 1693.</p>

<p>If that was the case, why would the Nazis that were also into occult things, paranormal &amp; conspiracy theories, ally with Japan in World War 2, while also committing &quot;The Holocaust&quot; against Jews? It makes no sense IMO.</p>

<p>A belief in God is a belief in a higher power than theirs and divine retribution for sins committed and a need for moral and ethical behavior on the part of the believers in order to avoid that. </p>

<p>UFO&#39;s are another but not dissimilar matter in that no power on Earth has ever been effective in trying to deal with them. Another challenge and proof that their authority isn&#39;t absolute or the last word on anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See this is where I lose the logic though. If there is a god, and he is a higher power and capable of divine retribution, and their whole game is to stop us from knowing that.. why don&#39;t they fear that divine retribution? You&#39;re pushing that they know there&#39;s divine retribution, but are completely cool with whatever it is they&#39;ll face after death because their power here and now is more important than whatever they&#39;ll face FOREVER.</p>

<p>Either God isn&#39;t a higher power capable of divine retribution, or this theory is shot in the foot from jump. It&#39;s highly irrational. Same with the Alien angle, if they know Aliens are real and we have no effective ways of dealing with them, why handcuff themselves by limiting the knowledge pool (keeping people in the dark) and having to  secretly carry out tests? It seems counter-active tbh unless the end game is just to stay in decadence till the invasion, not to ever try and stop it. Thats the only thing that makes Aliens more plausible than God for me..people would fear eternal retribution more than just being wiped out.</p>

<p>People can behave in a moral and ethical manner without having any religious convictions that prompt them to but they are few and far between and the rewards for the behavior are intrinsic not material... and as we know only too well, there are significant and often huge rewards for immoral and unethical behavior if you are rich and well-connected enough to other equally unscrupulous people to get away with it.</p>

<p>Society itself is big on punishing immoral and unethical behavior but otherwise does very little to actively encourage, promote, or reward the best examples of it when it occurs.</p>

Having said that, I go to a church that barely survives, supports a couple of missionary families, and is self supporting. Secondly, truly following Jesus in my opinion has to do with the belief in his teachings; that the Holy Spirit of God is with us and guides us in tumultuous times of right/wrong decision making. That the &quot;right&quot; thing to do is done simply because it is right, and has nothing to do with the avoidance of hell.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t be serious.  State-approved religions are a great way to control people.  Outside of some possibly allegorical references to Rome, the New Testament barely touches on citizenship and when it does encourages obedience.</p>

<p>Protestant Christianity especially is a very inwardly-focusing faith, despite the heavily-Nationalistic brand we have in the US now, it still encourages peace and focus on the state of the soul.</p>

<p>To that you can add the atheism of scientific materialism that basically reintroduced the wholly discredited philosophy of Materialism by the back door and is the only smart, modern and sophisticated way to look at life or anything else according to all of your educational institutions and the media... and the government.</p>

<p>As for Christianity encouraging peace or any focus on the state of one&#39;s soul that certainly doesn&#39;t jive with a nation that spends more on making war and the weapons of war than the rest of the world, friend or foe, all put together. A nation that has caused the deaths of at least 25 million people outside of it&#39;s own borders since the end of WWII. </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t make sense to because suppose the Canaanite god Moloch associated with child sacrifice is real, all that sacrifice &amp; worship proved to be in vain &amp; futile because look at his old proving grounds now -- it is in utter ruins. The worshipers clearly were shafted.</p>

<p>Also, the Nephilim were offspring of rebellious Fallen Angels that most likely forced themselves on daughters of man &amp; most likely died giving birth to giants too. They&#39;re the bad guys.

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve literally got hundreds of years worth of history where the words of a man who explicitly said &quot; you are all one in Christ Jesus&quot; in a statement of inclusion, have been used for the extermination/subjugation of other human beings.  We&#39;ve got dudes at this very moment using Jesus - a man who eschewed wealth, is on record vilifying it - to push the claim that &quot;God wants all&#39;a y&#39;all to be filthy rich&quot;: and they&#39;re making millions doing it.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a non-insignificant part of humanity as a whole that clearly doesn&#39;t read to much into their respective religious documents. Any group powerful enough to supposedly <em>work ceaselessly and globally to prevent even grassroots movements from so much as digging up a bone in their back yard</em> should be more than capable of messing with whatever message the &quot;truth&quot; would bring.</p>

<p>I have few doubt that the discovery of a literal <strong>other, non-human in biology and spirit, genealogical line</strong> couldn&#39;t be exploited to devastating effect: ESPECIALLY if they&#39;re the villains.  </p>

<p>&quot;&lt;insert ethnic minorities/political figures here&gt; are children of the nephilim and should be culled&quot;. &quot;We defeated them once before, we can do it again!&quot;: of course with who exactly &#39;them&#39; is changing every few years or so...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s many ways to interpret the Truth. 
With regards to children, I think they become what we teach them &amp; show by example. Children aren&#39;t born to hate &amp; be racists. Go to any playground with babies &amp; toddlers, you&#39;ll see they all play together -- unless they have other issues. 
Also, as another example, should we eliminate all Pitbulls because they will always grow up to be bad &amp; hurt people? Or can they be raised to be loving too?
Usually, I think it&#39;s GREED &amp; FEAR that drives people to act bad. </p>

<p>If &quot;they&#39;re&quot; completely evil, supposedly <strong>know</strong> god is real, and are absurdly influential to top it all off; if anything you&#39;d think they&#39;d be happy to leak the truth and <em>pervert it as thoroughly as they possibly could</em>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting that you mention megaliths &amp; ancient structures because we can&#39;t duplicate many of them today even with modern tools.</p>

<p>The way I see it is that you can believe in God(s) &amp; also believe in scientific methods. Why?</p>

<p>Because there&#39;s many things that science can&#39;t explain perfectly.</p>

<p>So scientists do their best to try to understand &amp; even re-create God&#39;s work but every time they fail, they realize that there&#39;s something more at play that is beyond their understanding through scientific method.</p>

<p>Scientists have recently discovered the &#39;God particle&#39;, &#39;antimatter&#39;, mapped the human genome &amp; 1000 years from know, maybe we too can create things like Annunaki or Gods.</p>

<p>E.g The mining of gold. Is it not safe to assume that a society with the capacity for interplanetary or interstellar travel would have easier ways to get some gold? Flying to another planet and creating an enslaved race of people seems like a lot more work than scanning asteroids until you found one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/433_Eros">like this</a> which contains an estimated 20 million tons of gold. </p>

<p>If labor was the issue and if these guys had the capability to bio-engineer a humanoid to work on this planet, couldn&#39;t they also bio-engineer a humanoid suited to working on an asteroid? The ore concentration would be magnitudes higher. It would take less time and labor to mine the asteroid. </p>

<p>Or if there was some reason they couldn&#39;t do that, why not crash the asteroid into the planet and mine it here? </p>

<p>And why dig tunnels into the earth and miss some of the richest gold deposits on the surface? Read up on gold rushes through history. People found places where they were tripping over lumps of gold. Why not go after the easier deposits first? </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make sense to me.</p>

Sitchin can&#39;t translate Sumerian though, does a lot of guessing and relie heavily on his hebrew school lessons. These days there are more complete and understanding scholars of sumeriam cuneiform who basically just shake their heads at Sitchin&#39;s shitty &quot;translations&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>CHECK. OUT. DR. MICHAEL. HEISER.</p>

<p>He is quite the scholar and dispels the idea that Zacharia Sitchin&#39;s translations are legitimate. Dr. Heiser does acknowledge the idea the giants existed and uses the Hebrew scriptures to back it up. He also agrees with the Hebrew scriptures on where the giants came from, fallen angels.</p>

<p>IHMO: The &quot;Ancient Alien/Annunaki&quot; theory is correct in the context of other human-oid beings that appear to have been altered but is completely wrong on why it happened and that its all for our own good. They are conditioning us to believe that Aliens are our Gods and the truth is...they aren&#39;t. In order to really grasp this concept I would suggest you look into (Tom Horn, Rob Skiba, and NYSTV).  </p>

<p>In a nutshell:</p>

<p>God (YHWH) created all things, including angels.</p>

<p>Angels rebelled against God and created a subset of humans (Genesis 6).</p>

<p>These offspring were half angel/half human and as were never supposed to exist.</p>

<p>This is why the Israelite&#39;s are commanded to kill certain people, they were descendants of this evil experiment (read 1Enoch and Genesis).</p>

<p>When the giants were killed off their spirits were &quot;wandering&quot; which is where demons/evil spirits come from.</p>

<p>All the pagan gods are really the same entities (Fallen angels and their offspring) just talked about from different perspectives/cultures. (check out Rob Skiba)</p>

<p>The biggest reason in keeping these things secret is because it throws the idea of evolution (in the scientific sense) out the window. When you study this enough you will also come across the idea of flat earth. Yes, there are crazy flat-earthers but Dr. Michael Heiser does indeed admit that the Hebrew writings describe our cosmology as Geocentric and yes, enclosed/flat. This in and of itself is very polarizing but if people knew the truth they would understand that there is a creator and he is the God of Israel, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  Imagine the way our governmental laws and societal structures would fall apart if they knew that we lived in a huge terrarium. Yes, God is that close and we are still living out his final plan.</p>

<p>All of our current situation is the end result of this angelic sin and the sins of Adam and Eve. God (YHWH) is trying to restore things back to the way they were supposed to be. Read the bible and get saved.</p>

<p>That said, I wonder how many archaeological skeleton finds would be in the &#39;unidentified&#39; or &#39;questionable&#39; based on existing matching methods?</p>

<p>Rather than the old skeletons, I&#39;m more interested in  &#39;The Kandahar Giant&#39; conspiracy theory because it&#39;s about U.S. soldiers fighting &amp; taking a 12&#39; - 15&#39; red haired with 6 digits giant in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s conspiracy theories about very tall super soldiers. Are they or have they weaponized giants for war?</p>

<p>If they found the &#39;Fallen Angels&#39; in Antarctica, they may want to control them, use them, or even weaponize them too IMO. </p>

<p>Bible Passages mentioning &#39;unicorns&#39;</p>

<p>--------------------------------------------</p>

<p>Numbers 23:22</p>

<p>God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn.</p>

<p>Numbers 24:8</p>

<p>God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.</p>

<p>Deuteronomy 33:17</p>

<p>His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.</p>

<p>Job 39:9-12</p>

<p>Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?</p>

<p>Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?</p>

<p>Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?</p>

<p>Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn?</p>

<p>Psalm 22:21</p>

<p>Save me from the lion’s mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.</p>

<p>Psalm 29:6</p>

<p>He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn.</p>

<p>Psalm 92:10</p>

<p>But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.</p>

<p>Isaiah 34:7</p>

<p>And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.</p>
