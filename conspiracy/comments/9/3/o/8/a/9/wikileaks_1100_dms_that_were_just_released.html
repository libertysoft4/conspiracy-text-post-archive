    <div class="md"><p>The messages show that WikiLeaks wanted the GOP to defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.</p>

<p>&quot;We believe it would be much better for the GOP to win,&quot; the WikiLeaks account states to a supporter named &quot;Emmy B&quot; in one of the messages from 2015. 
Another Twitter message from the WikiLeaks account describes Clinton as a &quot;bright, well-connected, sadistic sociopath.&quot;
WikiLeaks had been accused of bias against Democrats during the presidential race because of its release of hacked documents from the Democratic National Committee.</p>

<p>She also made sure that some interviewer asked her &quot;What&#39;s something unusual you keep in your purse?&quot; To which she answered with what I&#39;m sure she hoped looked like a mischievous grin, &quot;Hot sauce.&quot; This of course is supposed to appeal to black American women who, as stereotypes would have it, carry hot sauce around with them wherever they go. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think if you spend enough years going through school and then work denying your inner voice that screams how wrong everything is, then eventually it does go quiet.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, by silencing that voice, one loses the ability to recognize psychopaths in action.  I think this is what we are seeing here.</p>

<p>I suspect there is a very strong overlap between people who felt great about school and people who like Hillary Clinton.  Likewise, an overlap between people who really hated school (regardless of performance) and people who see through that fake lizard smile.</p>

<p>How about Russia? Plenty of evidence suggesting that Wikileaks omitted or opted out entirely of sharing information when it proved damaging to Russia.

I guess you could say trump is smart too if you consider he does a great job at riling people up and pointing them in a direction away from himself. It really is smart but its definitely divided the people pretty well, no ones willing to talk to the other side because the other one is &quot;evil&quot;. Now we the people wont get together and hold the government accountable for anything, its just democrats fault or republicans fault.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s kinda thrown a wrench into both of their systems over the past decade or so. People act like he has always been anti-DNC and pro-GOP but he seems anti corruption more than anything else. I think Wikileaks preferred the GOP to win because they knew Trump couldn&#39;t hide their corruption while if the DNC won then it&#39;d just business as usual. In other words Assange wanted this house of cards to come down and thought the GOP would expedite that.</p>

<p>Once Trump is taken down the GOP won&#39;t win another race for a long time. But by that time maybe some progressives will help steer the DNC towards less corrupt waters. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>[2015-11-19 13:46:39] &lt;WikiLeaks&gt; We believe it would be much better for GOP to win.</p>

<p>[2015-11-19 13:47:28] &lt;WikiLeaks&gt; Dems+Media+liberals woudl then form a block to reign in their worst qualities.</p>

<p>[2015-11-19 13:48:22] &lt;WikiLeaks&gt; With Hillary in charge, GOP will be pushing for her worst qualities., dems+media+neoliberals will be mute.</p>

<p>[2015-11-19 13:50:18] &lt;WikiLeaks&gt; She’s a bright, well connected, sadistic sociopath.</p>

<p>Edit to edit another excerpt a little later in the convo:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[2015-11-19 14:06:36] &lt;WikiLeaks&gt; GOP will generate a lot oposition, including through dumb moves. Hillary will do the same thing, but co-opt the liberal opposition and the GOP opposition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hard to disagree with anything here, but it doesn&#39;t mean WL should not be criticized for trying to get Donald Trump elected. Publishing stolen emails wasn&#39;t enough even, Assange had to help launch the Seth Rich theory and promote Pizzagate and Spirit Cooking as well. Basically functioning as an arm of the GOP with both critical facts about Hillary and the DNC <em>and</em> unconfirmed, evidence-free notions. And zilch on Trump or any of the bozos in his administration. Sessions, Prince, Manafort, Council for National Policy...zilch. </p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with having a bias and preference. There&#39;s alot wrong with Wikileaks operating this way. They were even trying to coordinate info with the actual Trump campaign.</p>

<p>Not to mention I&#39;m pretty much disgusted with Assange for not considering or even mentioning the damage Trump promised to do to immigrants (of color, obviously). The lack of empathy present in such a zero-sum, macro view of things is disturbing.  </p>

<p>Check the timestamps, numpty. The primaries weren&#39;t even over yet. Trump wasn&#39;t the focus of anybody until he won the RNC primaries. He wasn&#39;t even the front runner then. Notice how they said &quot;We believe it would be much better for GOP to win.&quot;? The GOP candidate hadn&#39;t been decided yet. They thought Hillary would have been worse than whatever candidate won the GOP primary. And I can&#39;t fault their logic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CW: At various points in the chat, there are examples of homophobia, transphobia, ableism, sexism, racism, antisemitism and other objectionable content and language. Some of these are couched as jokes, but are still likely to (and should) offend, as a racist or sexist jokes doesn’t cease to be racist or sexist because of an expected or desired laugh. Attempts to dismiss of these comments as “ironic” or “just trolling” merely invites comparisons to 4chan and ironic nazis. These comments, though offensive, are included in order to present as full and complete a record as possible and to let readers judge the context, purpose and merit of these comments for themselves.</p>

<p>The preface doesn&#39;t quote one .A confirmation of a stance was quoted. I read for about ten minutes and found what I guess is &quot;transphobia&quot;? </p>

[2015-05-03 00:27:08] &lt;WikiLeaks&gt; 35 years in prison is just fine, provided CM can be called a ‘she’ by the guards. Horror.
[2015-05-03 00:27:36] &lt;WISE Up Wales&gt; …the trans issues immediately. It’s a societal problem, how we place so much importance on gender. I just do what I can with it as it is.
[2015-05-03 00:28:47] &lt;WISE Up Wales&gt; Gender identity politics is a nightmare. &amp; a gift to the state, unfortunately.
[2015-05-03 00:29:28] &lt;WikiLeaks&gt; Yes. Gender essentialism is regressive.
[2015-05-03 00:30:58] &lt;WikiLeaks&gt; The whole fight was to liberate people from essentialism and understand that gender is a matrix of many biological signaling paths and..
[2015-05-03 00:32:14] &lt;WikiLeaks&gt; …behaviors, each of which can have different strength accross individuals and societies.
[2015-05-03 00:35:04] &lt;WISE Up Wales&gt; There’s no liberation where the fight’s ended up: now we’ve ‘the cotton ceiling’ where blokes who say they feel like they’re women…
[2015-05-03 00:35:21] &lt;WISE Up Wales&gt; …possibly only part time, complain that lesbians won’t have sex with them!
[2015-05-03 00:35:53] &lt;WikiLeaks&gt; To do away with binary ‘he’, ‘she’ as a stultifying simplfication and look at their unique values, skills and behaviors as an individual.
[2015-05-03 00:35:57] &lt;WISE Up Wales&gt; Meantime, many men are now afraid to enter social centres around UK for fear of being attacked for their behaviour
[2015-05-03 00:36:42] &lt;WISE Up Wales&gt; Yeah, a gender neutral pronoun would be v helpful.
[2015-05-03 00:37:53] &lt;WikiLeaks&gt; “the prisoner” has worked well for judges in our experience.
[2015-05-03 00:38:40] &lt;WikiLeaks&gt; “Bring the prisoner in”. “What do you have to say, prisoner?”, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah, I know why they labeled him all these things. Assange clearly hated Clinton and didn&#39;t have anything he deemed worthy of release from the GOP. So now they find a way to call him a sexist, racist, homophobe, whatever else they can manage. </p>

<p>I see it all the time. They&#39;ll even go after fellow left people. Like Sam Harris, a respected intellectual who has an anti-Trump podcast every month, soon as he made his opinion clear that while Trump is the worst candidate in history, it&#39;s also clear that Clinton is corrupt and deceptive.... Boom he was being labeled all the isms and ists available to discredit him for criticizing the left. Just about every YouTube progressive host has met this same fate because they dared come out and admit that intellectually they believe Clinton is shady. </p>

<p>They did the same with WL (Mind you I was in Berlin during their 10 year and met several staff who confirmed this). The reason Assange is every ist in the book is because that&#39;s how they discredit people. Even though Assange admitted &quot;Yes I don&#39;t like Clinton&quot; but he&#39;s also on record saying, &quot;I think Trump is a total moron&quot;. It just so happened that Russia gave him a really good dump of emails which were of public interest. Russia didn&#39;t give him anything of value from the GOP. That&#39;s not within his control that he doesn&#39;t have anything interesting. He&#39;s not going to go &quot;Oh we have leaks but we wont release them until we have leaks from the other political side, to keep it balanced!&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m a progressive liberal but super in love with capitalism.... So while I&#39;m DEFINITELY left leaning, the hypocrisy and attempts from the left to censor and dismiss people who disagree with them is going to be their undoing. They are alienating useful people within the party who could help. Many people on the left already frequently talkk about how scary the fringe parts are, with their attempts at censorship and removal of free speech, which they use entirely for political reasons. All they do is go &quot;I don&#39;t like this speaker, so I&#39;m going to find a way to call him a sexist mysoginist.... Then I&#39;ll report him and try to shut down his event... Thereby preventing people from hearing his words.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s awful. I can&#39;t fucking stand it. If anything makes me go right for an election, it&#39;ll be over this issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would love to source that for you...  It&#39;s a difficult thing to source for me in my current situation, however, I can comment further...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Guccifer 2.0 materials relate to the Access database from the DCCC.  This has largely been discredited because queries against the database were collated into excel documents with Cyrillic metadata.  I don&#39;t speak Russian or any other language written in Cyrillic, so I can&#39;t verify this, but I&#39;ve heard that it was actually Ukrainian, not Russian...  Still, it&#39;s been widely circulated as a Russian hoax of epic proportions (the database contained things like Nancy Pelosi&#39;s credit card info, as well as hundreds of other DC elite&#39;s PII.  The chans devoured this information and did successfully order pizzas and make phone calls directly to people like Pelosi and Schumer.  This database contained incriminating information on both democratic and republican elite.  Including a clear papertrail for the TARP funds being used to pay Senators of every color, which would mean congress got kickbacks for doing that massive bankster bailout).</p></li>
<li><p>The materials Wikileaks published are said to have come from two main sources: one being a leak from someone with direct access to the Exchange environment.  It&#39;s somewhat possible that there was no direct access involved and some very shrewd trickery was used to make it look as though the access was a direct connection and not over WAN.</p></li>
<li><p>John Podesta got phished.  He responded to &quot;Google Support.&quot;  This could have been anybody and, as I interpret the legalese, the indictment of the &quot;Guccifer 2.0&quot; team was not connected with this particular &quot;hack.&quot;  Those who submitted this material to Wikileaks remains a mystery.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Important to note that the Guccifer 2.0 indictments contain next to no (publicly available) evidence and there&#39;s very little chance the individuals named will be extradited to the united states to stand trial.  Therefore, the indictment could be merely symbolic and not reflective of any actual evidence or intention to prosecute.</p>

<p>My full point, however, is that the Guccifer 2.0 materials are often conflated with the stuff that Wikileaks published.  This is just not the case.  As described above, there were 3 major leaks.  None of which can be substantially linked to Russian actors, ESPECIALLY not if you had any technical grasp of the ramifications of the Vault 7 leak.  Additionally, the Guccifer 2.0 indictment refers only to 1/3 of these major leaks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was in Japan waiting out the election at the time of these various drops, so I&#39;m working largely off memory.  I was in the threads and absolutely know, for a fact, that the Access database contained legitimate information regarding many many DC elite.  I&#39;m back in the states now, so I will not comment on how I know the database was legitimate, but I&#39;ll certainly say that there were many people in those threads doing independent verification.  If the Russians sat on that information and organized it into an Access database fully in-line with the way US institutions organize their data...  I&#39;m a conspiracy theorist, but I&#39;m also an IT professional...  That hoax, consisting of personal information for thousands of DC&#39;s most protected people... If it is a hoax, the Russians are on another level and we should issue a prompt surrender in this information war.  Unfortunately, I don&#39;t believe the Russian hoax theory and instead I think there&#39;s clear evidence that hundreds of members of congress got major kickbacks laundered through a network of pizza shops and porno outlets from coast to coast as repayment for the TARP bailout. </p>

<p>[2016-10-21 09:59:58] &lt;Emmy B&gt; Many people are stopping outside the embassy in the short period that we are there tis week fretting about JA/WL with offers of help, urgent enquiries as to his health etc making us all worried and of course the main actors of this situation JA/WL &amp; Ecuador could be part of the plan to force a desperate act ie attempt an exodus.

<p>Reinforces my theory that <a href="/r/WhereIsAssange">/r/WhereIsAssange</a> was weaponized as black propaganda very early after its inception. </p>

<p>[2016-10-22 12:41:03] &lt;M&gt; Reddit has gone full conspiracy theory re WL. They now think the account is “compromised” so no longer trust anything it’s tweeting.</p>

<p>[2016-11-04 12:10:55] &lt;Emmy B&gt; After Internet is fully restored perhaps WL/JA consider doing an AMA in Reddit since the platform has been doing impressive crowd sourcing. </p>

<p>[2016-11-23 13:42:56] &lt;Emmy B&gt; we got the same stories at the vigil by one young guy calling himself Alex who said JA had been smuggled to US the day there was a chemical leak at City airport (which was apparently a smokescreen so he could be smuggled out) – why can’t I be rude every once in a while?</p>

I’ve been on this sub for 6 years and it was never like this.
I used to be able to spend literally all day following one thread down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>Now I barely want to read comments, because it’s the same re-hashed political bullshit.</p>

<p>And I’m more concerned with <em>conspiracies</em>.
Not just politics. </p>

<p>I miss the underground military base posts, aliens, alt-history, etc.
All the things this sub used to be, can be found in other smaller subs, but this place used to be the hub. 
Now it just feels like a one sided political chat room.</p>

<p>i&#39;m aware of the ones they have exposed about the USA. i&#39;m thankful for those. i can be thankful for that and still suggest they&#39;re Pro-Russia. </p>

<p>does that make sense?</p>

<p>i wanna know how much his plastic surgery costs, what kind of dudes he hooks up with (tillerson, for one), etc. stuff he doesnt want us knowing. </p>

<p>also your logic confuses me. i know the clintons were dirty and was happy to see them exposed. it didnt change what i knew. are you suggesting that, if someone is plainly corrupt, we should just accept it as part of the deal?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re feeling attacked and I can understand why reading through this post. I don&#39;t believe you&#39;re really interested in the things you just said. My point is that you say you &quot;knew&quot; the Clinton&#39;s were dirty but you meant suspected. Now you know. Well, we know Putin is a murderous dictator and no new knowledge is going to change that. If the Russians want that to change, that&#39;s on them. It&#39;s not any part of the deal for me. You&#39;re just talking about vengeance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>wikileaks invites it.</p>

<p>they should just claim what they are. an arm of russian intelligence. where are they when it comes to helping the russian people, the journalists, etc, anyone who opposes Putin lands in jail. surely they should be focused on those issues as well as american ones?</p>

<p>no. they wanted donald trump elected, a move which helps russia and china, a move that hurts Europe, a move that hurts most americans. i hate hillary clinton but at least we wouldn&#39;t be enemies of europe and friends with a country run by a literal KGB agent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone was speaking out about WL and Assange directed them to attach that person to the Rothchilds to make people not believe him. Or to discredit him by attaching them with the Rothchilds. </p>

<p>Assange was an absolute hero to me for a long time but he is not the person he was years ago. That became apparent when he came out in support of the GOP, then only sends dirt on the DNC during the election. Then it comes out yesterday that he had shit on Manafort but didn&#39;t leak it. It makes me wonder what else he got that he didn&#39;t leak.  I do not care one bit that he was for the GOP and dony blame him for not wanting HRC to win. The problem with that is that it goes against everything WL is supposed to stand for. Here is the statement from Hazel Press on why they leaked the convos:</p>

<p>&quot;At this point, considering the power exercised by WikiLeaks, [disclosing] literally anything Assange says is in the public interest,” Hazelpress told The Intercept, including Assange’s political position during the 2016 election, since “WikiLeaks purports to be a neutral transparency organization.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of my favorite wikileaks emails has to do with Israel/US, which I&#39;ll post below, but if you search <a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/?q=israel">&#39;Israel&quot; on Wikileaks</a>, you get 421,000 results. Obviously not all of them are going to be relevant, but there&#39;s a lot in there. </p>

<p>The decision to overthow Assad with United States intervention (arming/training &quot;moderate rebels&quot; and so forth) was made because it gives Israel a massive strategic advantage and reduces Iran&#39;s influence in the Middle East.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The power structure that is beginning to form in Russia, China and Iran is starting to get a little worrisome to me. We have SA, Israel so any type of power we can take from the group in the Middle East is fine with me. China is starting to consolidate a lot of power around the world and cementing positions. The Petro Yuan is going to be a bit of an issue. Some people say it won&#39;t matter, some say it will. Since I truly have no idea how global economics work, I guess I don&#39;t know either. It is def something I have been trying to gain more knowledge on though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. He is an egomaniac for sure. And there is no telling what happens to you when you are in a virtual prison for years on end. I guess my biggest issues with him are how easily he would send out disinfo and the things he did in the election. I def think he worked out a deal with Trump. As in they would lobby for him, or get him out of trouble completely somehow. I also think he created and was originally Q. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have had a feeling that he was Q last year from the similarities in the way Assange and Q communicate to people. It really wasn&#39;t much more than that for a while. Then, the day before Assanges internet was cut this year, Q posts, &quot;will be offline&quot; or &quot;will be offline for reason&quot;. Can&#39;t remember exactly. Then, his internet is cut and the next day, Q is posting on a different board. You would think that whoever was posting on the original board would say, &quot;Hey everyone, I am moving my page to this place&quot;. Since they only communicate online, moving their page without any notice and the coincidences of the internet stuff, kind of cemented my theory for me. I posted this and was mostly mocked. To be expected at that point really. Then someone sent me a link showing that MEGANON had come out saying she had been larped and Assange was Q. When you see all of the stuff Assange did during the election for Trump and the stuff above, I think he got with Bannon and made up Q. He then said I will continue to push for Trump for a deal to get me the fuck outta here. He took the data from Breitbart and WL to see what got the base riled up and also get people that weren&#39;t Trump supporters to back him. Then crafted Q&#39;s narrative from it. I think that whoever Assange was working with, took over Q when his internet was cut. He may not have even wanted them to but they did. 
And I definitely see a difference in the stuff posted by Q now compared to what was being posted in the beginning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So here&#39;s the conspiracy related to this release that I noticed: every article about it continues with the narrative that WikiLeaks preferred to get Trump elected. This narrative reinforces the idea that they were only releasing stuff on HRC because of that preference, and thus if they had anything on Trump, they held it back.</p>

<p>But search for yourself; they clearly didn&#39;t have anything on Trump, and bemoaned this lack of leaks. They were upset that the media thought that they were holding back. And most of all - just because they preferred Trump, it wasn&#39;t because they liked him. They just thought he would be far more ineffective, held back by his own party, Congress, and his own stupidity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem i see:</p>

<p>Even if those DMs are real, there is absolutely NO proof those DMs are real/from the real account. Those could have been from those common fake accounts(with letters in the name which look similiar/identical) existing for already many years, and thus fabricated.</p>

<p>By this, this could also one of many CIA-OP to make WikiLeaks look bad.</p>

<p>Also see:</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>And what the fuck. Then there is a random *group* DM-Chat, then some a few random IRC Chatlog snippets where various people shitpost and speculate?</p>

<p>And people also take this 100%ly for real?</p>

<p>I can see how some people side with Snowden but she is no Snowden. For Manning it was a personal vendetta. She leaked indiscriminately(essentially everything she could get her hands on). imo she is a pos and should still be in prison.</p>

<p>Check the timestamps, numpty. The primaries weren&#39;t even over yet. Trump wasn&#39;t the focus of anybody until he won the RNC primaries. He wasn&#39;t even the front runner then. Notice how they said &quot;We believe it would be much better for GOP to win.&quot;? The GOP candidate hadn&#39;t been decided yet. They thought Hillary would have been worse than whatever candidate won the GOP primary. And I can&#39;t fault their logic.</p>
