<p>The difference is I&#39;m joking about Hollywood depravity, not about raping children.</p>

<p>James Gunn quotes: (small sample)</p>

<li><p>&quot;Leading in Votes on which American Idol Contestant I should Rape: Sanjaya with 12 votes, followed by Constantine with 3&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;RT @peteralton I like it when little boys touch me in my silly place. Shhh!&quot;</p></li>

<p>Still nowhere near as bad as confessing to raping a 13 year old. The fact that you don&#39;t seem to understand that is honestly a little frightening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a similar discussion the other day. </p>

<p>Tweets may not be confirmation of a crime, but they can be strong indicators.</p>

<p>Gunn was pals with Lloyd Kaufman and Huston Huddleston amongst others.</p>

<p>Huston Huddleston was convicted of child pornography and recently sentenced. He was a facebook friend of Gunn. Here is a post from Gunn&#39;s blog which he tried and failed to scrub from the web during his rush to shutdown his blog on Friday.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630045941/http:/www.jamesgunn.com/2010/09/20/video-100-pubescent-girls-touch-themselves/">https://web.archive.org/web/20120630045941/http:/www.jamesgunn.com/2010/09/20/video-100-pubescent-girls-touch-themselves/</a></p>

<pre><code>Huston Huddleston posted this video on my Facebook page
with the note “I thought you’d appreciate this.” 
My response: “Appreciate it?!! I just came all over my own face!!”

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, let make a scale then...</p>

<p>What&#39;s off limits?</p>

<p>Is the rape of 1 baby objectively worse than the holocaust? Millions of people suffered, is that better than the suffering of one fictional baby? How about regular rape? If I make a joke about 10 people being raped is that too many fictional rapes? How many fictional rapes for the sake of a (admittedly, tasteless) joke is too many? Where do you draw the line? Are jokes about real world events not across the &#39;line&#39;, but jokes about baby rape that hasn&#39;t happened are? </p>

<p>Comedy has no &#39;lines&#39;. You obviously have to be conscious of what you&#39;re saying publicly if you work for a family company like Disney, but nothing is off limits in comedy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no, but being a comedian at least gives it some context and some reasoning behind those jokes. Also, a comedian usually has a target audience, like people who would get these so-called edgy jokes. Who was Gunn&#39;s target audience? Definitely not the PG-13 crowd. </p>

<p>even if she apologised about her comments in that interview doesnt excuse that she repeatedly posted extremly controversial /racist comments even after she was warned about the consequences. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t mind me, just noticed the Roseanne Barr mention in your comment and wondered to myself whether you&#39;ve ever posted something critical of Trump, or the right in general. It would appear not. I&#39;m not trying to defend Gunn here, but it would appear this recent crusade of yours is more about defending Trump and attacking his enemies than anything to do with pedos.</p>

<p>Epstein had close ties to the Clintons.

<p>I wonder if he has a problem with all the time Epstein spent at Mar-a-lago or this conspicuous quote by Trump:</p>

<p>“I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,” Donald Trump told New York magazine in October 2002. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”</p>

Especially Trump since he has such a long history of sexualizing young woman and sexual assault- I mean he was already accused of raping a 13 year old. </p>

<p>Oh well, at least I got you to admit he&#39;s, at best, a pedophile enabler. I&#39;ll take that as a win and hope you come to your senses later. I&#39;ve got bad news for you though- Bill and Hillary Clinton&#39;s crimes don&#39;t make Trump&#39;s disappear. You&#39;ll have to learn that one day.</p>

<p>Why is that an excuse? It&#39;s pretty clearly racist to compare black people to apes. Couldn&#39;t James Gunn use that same excuse. &quot;They were jokes, actually raping children wasn&#39;t ever in my mind!&quot;</p>

<p>Why? That was 6 years ago. You don&#39;t think someone can become racist in 6 years? There are KKK members today who weren&#39;t racist/KKK members six years ago. People change.</p>

<p>Irregardless- it&#39;s still a racist comment. Full stop. If she doesn&#39;t hold racist beliefs, that&#39;s great but she still said something very racist. Why would she get a pass for that? Wouldn&#39;t letting that slide be normalizing racism?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, everyone has the right to free speech. But that means freedom to say what you want without government persecution. That doesn&#39;t mean freedom from all consequences. ABC is private company, they employed her if they want to fire her because she is bad for their brand/image they had every right to fire her. </p>

<p>Just like Disney had every right to fire James Gunn. I think the circumstances were different, and if it were me i&#39;d be more lenient on Gunn because of how old these tweets are, but I don&#39;t fault Disney for exercising their right to protect their brand. They had every right to fire him and I don&#39;t blame them for it.</p>

<p>I do find it funny that people are bending over backwards to make Roseanne&#39;s comment okay. Speaking out of ignorance doesn&#39;t somehow make it fine. You shouldn&#39;t get a pass for being <em>accidentally</em> racist (If you even believe that excuse that she didn&#39;t know VJ was half black- I don&#39;t believe that at all and I don&#39;t see how anyone can). Roseanne had no excuse for not knowing better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because nobody cared about James Gunn back then enough to look into his tweets, and the people who did were fans of his who understood the jokes he was making. Everyday people who are not fans of Troma and Super aren&#39;t going to get the humor and that&#39;s fine, but now these same people who don&#39;t understand are trying to hold him accountable years later as if they understand better than anyone. It&#39;s frustrating. I don&#39;t get a lot of pop country radio, but if people want to brag about sleeping with girls in trucks, that&#39;s their problem. No one was hurt by these tweets, just offended. Can we just let that be that and get over it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just like pizzagate, there is no solid evidence that James Gunn is a pedophile. No one has come out to accuse him of messing with them, or their child, no other pedophiles have said they consider him a pedophile; In America it is NOT illegal to be acquainted to perverts, but it is for obvious reasons frowned upon. The anger people feel about his firing is that Disney conveniently ignored it when he was hired years ago, and now it&#39;s suddenly and career ending offense, for no other reason than people brought it up again. I understand why it happened, I think it&#39;s unfair, but that doesn&#39;t make him a pedophile, and everyone jumping on the bandwagon because you don&#39;t like it, he can&#39;t go to jail just because you dislike him. You managed to get him fired, silver lining as far as I&#39;m concerned is that it&#39;s another great director who will hopefully go back to making films where he doesn&#39;t have to constrain to a corporate image. Looking forward to the next Super. </p>

<p>As I said before in another topic.  Disney was well within their rights to terminate Gunn.  Ironically Gunn supported boycotts and firing others for similar behavior.</p>

<p>Gunn deleted 10,000 tweets and his blog, much of which focused on pre-pubescent kids a little toooooo much including frequent &quot;jokes&quot; about child rape and sexual abuse of children.</p>

<p>Disney is a family company. They are well within their rights to terminate and blacklist a director that could harm their company image.</p>

<p>What&#39;s happening now is a PR push by paedophile supporters in Hollywood to try and turn the focus away from Gunn and Harmon, whitewash their activity, and create public normalization and acceptance for paedophilia.</p>

<p>That&#39;s, at best, a super fucking weird exchange with a registered sex offender and the topic was about their experiences at a organization built to foster sexual relationships between boys and grown men. </p>

<p>It&#39;s very possible that James Gunn just has a weird sense of humor. That&#39;s cool and perfectly legal. But to completely ignore such an odd exchange is dense, and I don&#39;t think you&#39;re dense.</p>

<p>Still no solid evidence. And Gunn shares the same opinion as you, free speech isn&#39;t illegal, but companies can hire and fire you at their discretion. The public outcry is not to normalize pedophilia, but to avoid normalizing the punishment of directors for mistakes in their past that are not even illegal. It shouldn&#39;t matter that he&#39;s apologized or not(he has), Disney fired him because they thought people would not go to see a movie directed by him after they read tweets of his from before he started working with Marvel. People are trying to use their voices and the internet to say that they would in fact see another movie by him. Others are using their voices to say the opposite. The final decision is up to Disney, personal opinion is up to you and me, and my opinion is that it&#39;s unfair, and I would like to see Gaurdians of the Galaxy 3 directed by James Gunn. We can&#39;t always get what we want, but it can&#39;t hurt to ask.  </p>

<p>The hypocrisy is deafening in that Hollywood is circling the wagon for Gunn&#39;s frequent &quot;jokes&quot; focusing a little tooooo much on child rape and paedophilia, yet there was zero groundswell of support for Roseanne Barr.</p>

<p>Barr was the Green Party Black Caucus representative. She&#39;s said more than a few times that racism never factored into her tweet that got her show canceled and fired.</p>

<p>Hollywood including Gunn raced to publicly lynch Barr.</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to focus on the paedophilia aspect because honestly that should be the focus per the self.text.</p>

<p>However, the hypocrisy is astounding.  The same people that viciously attacked Trump for a private consensual affair with stormy daniels and for a hot mic &quot;grab em by the pussy&quot; comment  that both happened over 10 years ago are the same group of people defending Gunn and Harmon for something far more reprehensible (and possibly criminal if suspicions prove true).</p>

<p>When it comes down to it, people defending and acting as apologists for Gunn and Harmon&#39;s frequent disgusting comments on child rape and sex abuse of children are simply normalizing acceptance of paedophilia.</p>

It’s the hypocrisy of the Christian Conservative crowd holding Trump to a different standard than every politician before him that upsets most, and the cover up and hush payments that probably came from campaign funds that bother some others.

That’s twice now you’ve tried to make a false equivalence with a bad comparison about false outrage to justify your position, once with Trump and once with Roseanne, all to show off some sort of fake hypocrisy coming from the left. We get it, you’re mad Roseanne got fired for being racist and Trump got caught being kinda rapey, and it makes you feel better if rather than being bad people they were just targets of the some good old fashioned liberal hypocrisy, and if that means you have to willfully remove context or pretend you don’t understand what a joke is that’s what you’re going to do.

    <div class="md"><p>Sigh, nobody gives a fuck about Stormy. It’s the hypocrisy of the Christian Conservative crowd holding Trump to a different standard than every politician before him that upsets most, and the cover up and hush payments that probably came from campaign funds that bother some others. Nobody cares Trump fucked her. Also Trump was BRAGGING ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT not making a joke to Billy Bush. That’s twice now you’ve tried to make a false equivalence with a bad comparison about false outrage to justify your position, once with Trump and once with Roseanne, all to show off some sort of fake hypocrisy coming from the left. We get it, you’re mad Roseanne got fired for being racist and Trump got caught being kinda rapey, and it makes you feel better if rather than being bad people they were just targets of the some good old fashioned liberal hypocrisy, and if that means you have to willfully remove context or pretend you don’t understand what a joke is that’s what you’re going to do. And if that fails, well then it’s time to ring the ‘normalizing’ alarm. Just like murder has been normalized by Brooklyn 99, and incest normalized by Arrested Development liberals are joking their way to making baby fucking the wave of the future one tweet about water pressure at a time. </p>
