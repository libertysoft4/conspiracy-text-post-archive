<p>Unfortunately this sub got overran by a collective effort to dissuade independent and critical thinking.  Unfortunately, this sub isn&#39;t what it was when I came to it seven years ago.  Unfortunately, thinking differently than whatever narrative is trying to be pushed these days is subject to attacks and ridicule.  Unfortunately, people aren&#39;t allowed to have their own opinion on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right.  It&#39;s unfortunate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems to me like you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about. It wasn&#39;t personal, it was direct attacks on what Maxwell was releasing and publishing. Maxwell was not military but Cooper was. Who knows what happened to him while he was in. As far as Q goes? I don&#39;t care. I&#39;m just pointing out what you said. Cooper was a gatekeeper himself. Anyone who has been in the community for long enough and has done enough research, would know that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a follower, a learned elder of it. He was/is an insider and whistle blower. He was friends with Manly Hall. Read Sun Tzu. That&#39;s the approach Maxwell took. Cooper&#39;s beliefs blinded him and was his achilles heel. </p>

<p>Maxwell spoke how the elites created christianity while Cooper followed it. Curious no? Add in the military background of Cooper and the bigger picture will come into focus. </p>

What&#39;s happening is plainly stated and the truth coming out has lit a fire under anyone with enough discernment to truly THINK for thrmselves. The &quot;coincidences&quot; involving certain words and numbers (17) increase every day that Trump is very aware of the Q phenomenon and it&#39;s painfully obvious to those of us following the drops and lurking chans that some suppressed revolution is bubbling up around us that is nothing less than the Second American Revolution. Some would say it&#39;s time to free ourselves again and Q claims to have a plan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q is mostly popular among low-intellect rural retirees. The only people who buy into it tend to be the over 40 crowd, aka the most easily duped people on the internet. It has the same appeal as Nostradamus, horoscopes, palmistry, and stuff like that. Additionally, there is an extremely religious component to it which essentially requires to adopt one psy-op (religion) whole-heartedly to participate in the Q psy-op. </p>
