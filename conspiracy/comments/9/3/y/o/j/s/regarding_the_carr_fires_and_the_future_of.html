        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This past winter/fall, I worked with a fire ecologist in Lakeport, California, doing controlled burns and implementing other means of fire prevention. He had decades of experience doing this, and told us that there would be a terrible fire this year. He said a lot of different things could have happened over the years; that the way fire prevention in the area has been handled as a whole is nothing short of neglect. </p>

<p>Now the fires are happening <em>exactly</em> as he described they would. He, along with other conscious property owners we worked with, all said the same thing: that the fires that have been affecting California for the past several years have been allowed to happen. Possibly even intentionally started. The fires that swept through Middletown and the surrounding area a few years ago supposedly had 8 different, simultaneous ignition points in a semi-circle to the north. Every property owner we worked with said the same thing: they&#39;re trying to drive people away from the area to secure the natural resources for themselves. </p>

<p>Clear Lake is an amazing fresh water source, and in the coming years/decades, it will become immensely valuable. Additionally, one land owner and her husband said that there were valuable minerals and metals underground that could only be extracted if the population were not there. These same land owners also talked about the odd activity of the Coast Guard, specifically regarding HAARP. While we were there, there were days when our entire group&#39;s mood would just plummet. Like, I&#39;m no stranger to having mood swings, but this was unusually powerful, and synchronous with everyone at the same time. She suggested that HAARP was being used to keep the population under fear, and while I can&#39;t say anything about that, there was a lot of unusual activity in the area that left a bad feeling in my mouth. </p>

<p>Sometimes literally. There were days when there would be a rainbow halo around the sun. We commented on how pretty it was, but then we were told it was the aluminum in the air. I&#39;ve never been a chemtrail conspiracy theorist, but <em>something</em> was putting unusual amounts of chemicals in the atmosphere, and the orchard- and vineyard-rich lands of Lakeport are no stranger to strange cloud streams from regular fly-overs. </p>

<p>I just wanted to share some of my experiences, because watching everything unfold as we&#39;ve been told is unsettling. Of course no one&#39;s listening. There were people <em>watering there homes</em> and thought that would be enough to protect them. The majority of people in the area were very unconscious. Also, it was pretty much a police state while we were there. The number of cops patrolling the 5,000 population town of Lakeport was absurd. I&#39;m concerned the people will just roll over, as is tradition in America, and let the land be taken over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting that you bring up Clear Lake and the fact that it feels they&#39;re being driven from their homes. They had a fire earlier this fire season and now there&#39;s two more fires eating their way towards Clear Lake as we speak from Mendocino.</p>

<p>The River Fire - <a href="http://www.fire.ca.gov/current_incidents/incidentdetails/Index/2178">http://www.fire.ca.gov/current_incidents/incidentdetails/Index/2178</a></p>

<p>The Ranch Fire - <a href="http://www.fire.ca.gov/current_incidents/incidentdetails/Index/2175">http://www.fire.ca.gov/current_incidents/incidentdetails/Index/2175</a></p>

<p>Pawnee Fire was one that happened earlier - <a href="http://www.fire.ca.gov/current_incidents/incidentdetails/Index/2080">http://www.fire.ca.gov/current_incidents/incidentdetails/Index/2080</a></p>

<p>At first I was thinking, &#39;Good grief, they just can&#39;t catch a break.&#39; Now that you&#39;re saying it&#39;s a possible valuable resource they want to keep to themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s safe to say most people will just chalk this up to the drought and just being unfortunate. Like, this is something that blows my mind. People will be like &quot;those sociopathic corporations will stop at nothing to turn a profit! We need more oversight!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yea, those running them and our government would have no problem destroying the lives of a few thousand people for their personal gain. See 9/11, every war ever, most avoidable tragedies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No they wouldn&#39;t do that! This is fate!&quot;</p>

<p>The cognitive dissonance is real!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I don&#39;t know how long after a wildfire starts to when they begin investigating the cause. I know the 2017 wildfires that were around the Napa area were blamed on PG&amp;E, however there were numerous reports on Facebook of people claiming they saw a black car and a white van following each other around setting more fires. Nothing ever came of it either. People were posting pictures of the vehicles as well.</p>

<p>This was the fire map for the area last year. <a href="https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2017/10/Cal-Fire-map-12-October-630x447.jpg">https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2017/10/Cal-Fire-map-12-October-630x447.jpg</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve come to learn that CalFire doesn&#39;t show all the grass fires on the map, they will have them listed on the website but will say &#39;This is not a CAL FIRE incident. Please click the link for more information.&#39; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree! I just started my first serious garden this year and its so rewarding. The tomatoes seriously taste like a completely different plant than the store bought. So much flavor. My property management company had the gall to reprimand me for putting a garden in the plots of dirt that were filled with overgrown weeds before that they dont take care of even tho its their responsibility cause its a triplex haha.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, gardening is very rewarding in a lot of ways. Kale is a great addition to any garden because the turn around is so quick and it can be grown for most of the year. There was one Thai restaurant we went to in California that had gardens in their parking lot islands. That&#39;s what we need to inspire more people to do: innovate and use the land that&#39;s available. We&#39;re not doing ourselves any good being reliant on the preexisting institutions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is also a pattern which is discussed in <em>The Wikileaks Files</em> (Chapter 1 America and the Dictators, page 55) in regards to Latin/Central America:</p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li>One effect was to drive small farmers and peasants off the land, filling the urban centers with willing employees.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>The Trump trade war will most likely have the same effect--soybean prices are down 12% (as of mid-July).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/agriculture/2018/06/15/china-tariffs-soybeans-could-cost-iowa-farmers-up-624-million/705121002/">https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/agriculture/2018/06/15/china-tariffs-soybeans-could-cost-iowa-farmers-up-624-million/705121002/</a></p>

<p>Trump&#39;s trade war has also hit pork producers--supposedly the cargo ships are full of unbought pork.</p>

<p>The small farmers will be hit hardest; the larger, corporate farms may weather it better.</p>

<p>The only true winners will be the Wall Streeters who shorted US soybeans and invested in Brazilian agriculture products...and the USG which expects more money gained from the tariffs placed on Chinese goods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s really strange. I totally believe it. I think they were putting some chemicals in the atmosphere to make it easier to reverberate a HAARP transmission out over a wider area; use the diffraction to scatter the frequencies and perturb a population&#39;s mental/emotional state. The general mood of Lakeport was terrible. Like, people had given up on life and were just going through the motions like zombies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most definitely. The entirety of this year has been very turbulent mood swings for everyone on my hill. Lots of depression, general lunacy, horrid decision making and zombie motions. I&#39;ve noticed sleeping indoors to increase irrational behavior in myself. Been truck sleeping and walking barefoot. Seems to help my demeanor but as I &quot;vibrate higher&quot;, the people around me have been vibing lower, nearly almost going out of their way to jostle my mood. </p>

<p>Glad you noticed the Sun halos..a few years ago the chemtrails I experienced in Covelo(a few hours north of Lake) were so bad they literally irritated my eyes and turned a chemtrail denier into a believer within a few minutes.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a really interesting local to Redding &quot;live&quot; news report where the reporter explains that, in a neighborhood with no fires, cars were flipped over and roofs ripped off houses as if a tornado came through the neighborhood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes the fire starts and spreads so quickly that, you have only a few short minutes to get out. You learn what’s really important in life when have 10 mins to evacuate. We put clothes on and grabbed our critters, then we were out of time. 
     There’s a lot that can be done to slow the fires down, but it involves everyone following the rules put in place and unfortunately not everyone will. We cleared the brush around our property and kept our trees trimmed. Our neighbors didn’t and our house nearly burned to the ground because of that lazy neighbor. Most fires are stared accidentally, like the Carr fire was started by a malfunctioning car. Others are started by illegal camp fires. If people would use simple common sense then we wouldn’t have nearly as many fires as we’ve had lately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As MattIsMyCat pointed out. The fires burned so hot they created their own weather patterns, which caused tornados. Yet that doesn&#39;t explain a pic I&#39;ve seen of a half a house burnt down which literally looks like the house was sawed in half. And a trampoline fully intact directly over the fence of a house completely burned down. </p>

<p>There could be a fully reasonable explanation for the half house and trampoline not melting...tho how does a wooden fence and trampoline not burn when they are within 30 ft of an entire house on fire? Maybe some badass with a garden hose? Or they happened to be doused by a plane or helicopter? I don&#39;t have those answers.</p>

<p>What I did witness was odd chemtrails the day of the 28th of July, when the Mendo Complex fires started roaring. Full lines across the sky with dashed out chemtrails in between. Layered about 5-7 chemtrails deep, starting and ending in full lines with the dashed lines in between.</p>

<p>Even stranger, yet more anecdotal, my buddy was on the ridgeline as it was burning. He said he was watching some of the planes &quot;make clouds&quot; as he put it. Three planes would layer a spray or mist (not the red retardant stuff) in the same area and a cloud would form. Later we watched as the fire seemed to hit a microclimate, and most likely a fire break, and it would completely stalemate. Turning into a thunder head looking cloud like I&#39;ve seen in Florida. Not the Pyrocumulous clouds I had watched it produce earlier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, I imagine there was a large incentive to damage the weed industry to normalize the market, in their favor of course.</p>

<p>While we were there, we were going to visit some hot springs but never got the opportunity. Glad we didn&#39;t then!</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say either way how the town&#39;s culture developed. Regardless, there were very few people in town who would be able to piece together any conspiracy going on under their nose. We mostly stayed with the one fire ecologist, and branched out to a few communities and remote properties in the area. The people off-grid were at least awake enough to see the strings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This fire is acting like no other fire I&#39;ve even seen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yea, because there is so much fuel everywhere. While driving to some properties, the ecologist would point out how the fire would spread. There are so many areas that should have been cleared out to slow down any encroaching fire. But they, weren&#39;t thereby allowing the fires to travel at top speed. The controlled burns we did in the mountains around Scotts Valley probably gives the town an extra day before the fires will reach there.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure whomever allowed this to happen is also fucking with the weather to create these conditions. It&#39;s not like we haven&#39;t had the ability to do this for 50-60 years...</p>

<p>I had not considered tech being in the rural NorCal.  However it makes sense with some of the CIA connections up there.  One of those fake hippy compounds could easily be cover for this.  NorCal gets a fair amount of UFO stuff, usually tied to Mt. Shasta.</p>

<p>Are you local NorCal?  My pet theory is the future social/cultural battle will be fought in NorCal.  Techies and Bionics and Statists (Bay Area) vs the Humanists (NorCal).  Humanists will not chip up and reject virtually all of the Statist stuff (GMOs, nanny state, wide array of issues).  This is seen at Burning Man presently as the tension between Darktards (NorCal) and Sparkle Ponies (Bay Area).</p>

<p>Obviously. It&#39;s not like they would willfully have a blindspot.</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m from New York originally. My ex and I flew to Oregon to work with a nonprofit, which turned out to be a cult. We got completely blind-sided with the brainwashing and wound up sticking with a tentacle group after a planned schism to win back our loyalty.

One person I met in line at Safeway told me there was 3 fire trucks at their house and they did nothing while it burned down. I have also heard Cal fire was ordered to stand down at the start of the fire. I think someone wanted this fire to get out of control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a nagging feeling that the central valley is one of the next ones up. There is land in between Sacramento and Stockton that is currently protected or used for agriculture that is prime real estate for developers here. With a more developed overlap of San joaquin/sacramento countis, you&#39;re looking at a smaller scale LA. The area is already being marketed as &quot;the greater silicon valley&quot; and developers in Stockton are pushing north(sacramento developers pushing south). These guys have been pulling scams for decades now, and are no strangers to using arson as a tool of devaluing real estate(check out the rash of downtown fires from a couple years ago). Hoping im just paranoid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t mind me digging this thread back up, but something interesting has come across my Facebook feed. This was posted on a page dedicated to local dealings around the county. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/8596749-181/napa-woman-convicted-in-lake">https://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/8596749-181/napa-woman-convicted-in-lake</a></p>

<p>So this woman admits to starting 11 different fires that have been happening around Berryessa. The thing that was the most interesting to me was... She works for the County of Solano. </p>

<p><a href="https://transparentcalifornia.com/salaries/2016/solano-county/debra-a-windholz/">https://transparentcalifornia.com/salaries/2016/solano-county/debra-a-windholz/</a></p>

<p>&quot;In interviews with Cal Fire investigators, Windholz admitted to discarding lit cigarettes and matches at the ignition points of several of the fires, Deputy District Attorney Agnes Dziadur said.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting to see someone, who works for the County, being capable of doing something like that. Something in the back of my head kind of wonders if it&#39;s something more than just that. If there wasn&#39;t a little help to push her to do it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s really weird about the house and trampoline. I mentioned in another comment that we saw a ufo on one of the offgrid properties, zipping around, seemingly defying physics. There&#39;s likely some tech development going on in the area.</p>
