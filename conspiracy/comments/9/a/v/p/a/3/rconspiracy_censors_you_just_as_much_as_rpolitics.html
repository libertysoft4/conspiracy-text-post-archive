<p>Money changes people. The day I get money, I&#39;m looking into a house than can support a personal gym too.</p>

<p>But what I gather mostly is you know you agree with me. A lot of right wingers I truly believe are secret communists and don&#39;t know it. They want to destroy their elite system and want to make it fair for them too. Communist.</p>

<p>Bezos sure may be your CIA hitman but he was just also the man with the big time company name. Doing it just slightly different from ebay to corner a market that started during the internet era. TBH... explaining this to people just makes my blood boil.</p>

<p>Taking away elitism is communism. Anyone can disagree with how it was handled and the elites created after &quot;communism&quot; was implemented..</p>

<p>Statistically &quot;blacks&quot; as a whole are at the bottom of the economic ladder in nearly every country....so no statistically a &quot;black&quot; Trump would probably not have the same success.

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, that makes more sense.  I was completely lost.  Look, I don&#39;t agree with a lot of the removals around here, but none the less, compared to 99% of other subs, this place is the most free.  We have both sides of the political coins duking it out while over partisan shit, while more conspiracy minded people just trying to open eyes.  I&#39;m sure you can so me a slew of removals that I would agree aren&#39;t justified, but that&#39;s the nature of the way reddit has chosen to set up the way they have their content controlled.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I agree with you that this sub is one of the more open subs where people are open to discussing information freely, which is why I&#39;m almost exclusively adding content here, and relatively no where else, but this particular mod is trying to single handely crush the free flow of information, in my opinion, and I think it&#39;s important we call rouge mods like this one out on their bullshit to keep this sub free and open like it has always been.</p>

<p>Just go though their history tonight, and look at the posts and comments they&#39;ve removed from this sub!  It&#39;s really frustrating to me to have content that is totally innocent and which adds to the discourse removed by heavy handed mods for no apparent reason, that&#39;s all I&#39;m saying. Thanks for the exchange though. I&#39;ve got you marked as &quot;friend&quot; so I definitely do value your opinion here.</p>
