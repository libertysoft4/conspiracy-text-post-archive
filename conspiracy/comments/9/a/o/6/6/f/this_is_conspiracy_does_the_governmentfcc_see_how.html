        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First off let me start by saying I do believe this event was a real tragedy and anytime there’s a loss of life if it be one or 100 it’s not good. </p>

<p>However I am apart of this community for a reason and I’ve been discussing heavily the amount of viewership twitch, mixxer, YouTube, and Facebook get for gaming. This is ALL DAY, EVERY DAY. </p>

<p>Let’s take a look at NEWS and SPORTS. </p>

<p>Both are CONSTANT things in an average persons life. </p>

<p>Sports such as baseball, hockey, and basketball are TERRIBLE for attendance and a lot of times terrible for viewership. Football and NASCAR definitely step it up in that regard but it’s a weekly thing. </p>

<p>Now to the news, we all know the struggles for viewership there. It’s definitely not a secret that more and more people are turning the news off and it’s not just the people in this sub. </p>

<p>With AMAZON (key) buying out twitch recently , could we see the big controllers moving heavy weights to ensure the stability of that platform? No streamer on twitch has to stream in a delay and when there is no delay there simply isn’t much of time from the streams feed to your screen that passes. For instance the biggest streamer on twitch , has 75k average viewers and you can donate to him and watch the feed instantly note it. </p>

<p>So my question for the community is, do we feel the government and FCC see the potential shift in entertainment and they are going to do a few things to ensure they can set perimeters on the industry.</p>

<p>Again I do 100% believe this specific instance is legit but I cannot help but wonder when the barrier for video game streaming will get bigger. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>75k for one person, concurrently EVERY TIME THEY CLICK START STREAM. </p>

<p>Lol this is better than the sitcom on Tuesday just in the early stages. Personalities bring more viewers. Thus sitcoms. What happens when every stream is a different personality. Or different game. Or they are adding way more IRL (in real life) streams as well. </p>

<p>Like majority. The sleep is heavily with this new form of entertainment. It’s so new yet brings in SOOO MUCH MONEY. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theres a difference you&#39;re missing and its important. I can&#39;t say whether it sways in favor or against video games, but...</p>

<p>75k views on a twitch stream is valuable because twitch is a website focused on interaction. Cable has no 2-way interaction, it is 1 directional, unresponsive media. Twitch is not. This is important to mention during discussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you dumb lol. I’m saying that the government and fcc are the pimp and things like twitch and twitter are it’s hoes. </p>

<p>If your hoe isn’t wearing what you want it to you will change that. No matter if it’s your best hoe or not. </p>

<p>Amazon will get whatever they want as far as entertainment and the sharing of it. They are already making giant strides to take over the entertainment world. There are plenty of stream services out there yet amazon picked twitch to partner with. </p>

<p>So now the fcc has to determine how with this being a legit media outlet for entertainment, news, and a social construct it’s hard to say that this field doesn’t have a huge target on its back from people who WILL cash in on its success. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you watch Sports? Because it&#39;s the same thing. </p>

<p>People have hobbies that they enjoy....if that&#39;s sitting and watching other people play games instead of woodworking, then that&#39;s fine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate sports (in a spectator sense), I think it&#39;s another distraction and waste of money, resources, and time.  You can defend it any way you&#39;d like.  You&#39;re allowed to have any opinion you like, but don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to change my mind on this.  </p>

<p>Go play the game instead of watching someone do it.  Everything, weather it&#39;s social media, sports, twitch, youtube.  At the end of the day they do provide some value (i.e. youtube can be educational, social media can help connect with family) but they are designed to consume your time and your mind.  They are designed for you to spend as much time as possible on them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just pointing out that it&#39;s similar. I find that a lot of people don&#39;t understand that othe people can have hobbies different than theirs. Obviously you already get it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t watch sports and I don&#39;t watch people play video games either. I really enjoy playing the games, why would I watch someone else play them?</p>

<p>The only thing I use YouTube for are do it yourself household help and live music. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree and I&#39;m old. Are you old? Teens and people in their 20s seem to hop on YouTube and Twitch and watch those as they are doing other computer stuff. You&#39;re doubting something that is bigger than you think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I broke up with a guy over this. He spent too much time watching other people playing video games, to the point where he was neglecting the important things going on in his own life. He seemed addicted to the escapism. I&#39;m not sure what was so terrible about his own life that he felt he needed to escape from (it couldn&#39;t have been me, because he was doing it long before I entered his life)-- I just didn&#39;t have the time to stick around and find out. I&#39;ve got a biological clock ticking with real world implications, whereas he&#39;s got meaningless timestamps on a bunch of Twitch streams.</p>

<p>I have a friend who just gave birth and is struggling to get her husband to put down the Xbox remote and help her with their first baby. I feel so sad for her, everyday she gets more depressed as she realizes its unlikely that he will ever change. I wish I knew what to say to him to wake him the fuck up and see what he&#39;s doing to the &quot;family&quot; he claims to love above all else (lolz)... and for what?! So he can hang out in a room, by himself, wearing headphones and shouting profanities at a screen, connected with a group of teens half his age, all around the world, who he will never meet, competing in a madeup universe with stunning graphics, all for imaginary points and avatar enhancements? It&#39;s really just giving away large chunks of your life as a human and lining the pockets of large corporations with ad revenues. I just don&#39;t get it.</p>

<p>I have nothing against video games, or watching people play video games, in moderation. </p>
