        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi</p>

<p>I appreciate all the replies to my questions regarding van allen belts and moon landing.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, all the replies can be abbreviated into below.</p>

<p>&quot;We don&#39;t have money, motive to go back to the moon or daring through van allen belts with manned craft ever again, at least for now.&quot;</p>

<p>Ok, I get all the logic and explanations and thx for the answers.</p>

<p>Then, if we &#39;have&#39; money and motive, CAN WE GO BACK TO THE MOON?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume a situation, that Trump suddenly thinks it&#39;s good idea to claim space territory with second moon landing, and suddenly some rich people agree and decide to fund it because their lives are so boring, and the congress had booze party the day before so hard they accidentally pass the plan. Even military generals accidentally drink some water somebody put weeds in it, they agree to aid the plan. And several astronauts agree they would sacrifice their lives because second moon landing was their life dream.</p>

<p>So, now we hypothetically have money and (absurd) motives and suicidal astronauts in hand. Then CAN we go back to the moon again?</p>

<ol>
<li>As for the van allen belts, there are divided opinions and both sides claim they are correct and their opinions are facts. Honestly I can&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know their occupation, jobs, careers, which field they are in, so I don&#39;t know who can I trust. Some say van allen belts radiation is still fatal with any tech, some say it&#39;s actually not a problem unless it&#39;s a long journey to Mars.</li>
<li>I heard a lot that NASA has lost(or destroyed) the tech or documents. Is it true they can&#39;t recreate the tech even if they had money? </li>
<li>Long rambling in one sentence, CAN WE GO BACK TO THE MOON AGAIN IN 21TH CENTURY RIGHT NOW, IF WE HAVE LIMITLESS MONEY AND IMMEDIATE MOTIVE?</li>
</ol>

<p>This would be my final discussion about moon landing and van allen belts here.</p>

<p>If you were bothered by this series of questions, hope you can understand my curiosity.</p>

<p>Thx ahead.</p>

<p>Second landing in general, not second time for the astronauts.</p>

<p>&gt; Why would it be suicidal if the moon landings have happened 6 times so far? </p>

<p>Many people claim it&#39;s fatal because of van allen belts. And many recent smaller launches have failed.</p>

<p>&gt; The organisations that have actually researched the belts all say the moon landings occurred. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it hadn&#39;t occurred. I&#39;m talking about danger of van allen belts. Some even insist recent equipments are weaker against radiation than 70&#39;s ones.</p>

<p>&gt; Yes. </p>

<p>So you&#39;re not aware of the Apollo 12, 14, 15, 16 &amp; 17 landings? </p>

<p>It&#39;s a rather funny case of people listening to the experts when they say the belts are dangerous. But people then just stopped listening when the experts went onto say there&#39;s safe ways <em>around</em> the most dangerous parts in the belts. </p>

<p>Selective listening! </p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s reasonable enough. Some tech is more sensitive than others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be relatively trivial in terms of technology. Apollo 11 had less computing power than my Apple Watch, much less a modern computer. We have far better materials science, meaning we can effectively shield against cosmic radiation and other hazards. We have much better sensors and control systems, so guiding a vessel to land on the moon would be a trivial problem. For instance, SpaceX managed to get rockets to vertically land on fucking ocean barges. This is MUCH harder than getting a small Eagle-type capsule safely down on the moon.</p>

<p>In terms of money, the actual amount of money required would not be that much. We already have launch vehicles that can carry a lander module into orbit. You&#39;d need sufficient funds to build a lander and pay SpaceX or similar to put it into space. Someone like Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos could fund such a project from their personal wealth quite easily. The issue is ROI, what do we get for that money. It&#39;s never been about the actual amount of money involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That applies to &#39;business&#39;, not &#39;project&#39;.</p>

<p>Why do China and Russia have nuclear bombs though US started nuke development first, and why is China still trying space programs? It&#39;s not about competition. Space program is not about who grabs the market first with better cola design.</p>

<p>Yeah, somebody at least send a robot to install camera there. It seems very easy task compared to moon landing. Why don&#39;t anyone do that? If USA won&#39;t do it, then what are China and Russia doing?</p>

<p>Chang&#39;e 3 ( /tʃæŋˈʌ/; Chinese: 嫦娥三号; pinyin: Cháng&#39;é sān hào) is an unmanned lunar exploration mission operated by the China National Space Administration (CNSA), incorporating a robotic lander and China&#39;s first lunar rover. </p>

<p>That&#39;s how ignorant you are... this mission happened 5 years ago, yet you have no idea it even occurred.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter... the <strong>experts</strong> tell you how, and you refuse to believe them, so it doesn&#39;t matter what anyone here says.</p>

<p>If you won&#39;t believe NASA, you won&#39;t believe someone on reddit.</p>

<p>And there is your problem... what do you do if you think you have a brain tumor? Ask someone on the internet or go talk to a doctor?</p>
