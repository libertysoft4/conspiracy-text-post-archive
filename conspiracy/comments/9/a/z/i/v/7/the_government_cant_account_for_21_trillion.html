<p>If one penny represents a million, then one thousand pennies, or $10, represents a billion. On the same scale, one million pennies, or $10,000, represents a trillion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, last time they went looking for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aljgYENg--Y">2.3 missing trillions from the Pentagon on Sept 10th 2001</a> the Pentagon conveniently received a <del>missile</del> plane where the servers holding the data were. Oh and I heard the WTC 7 had paper records relating to that, but don&#39;t quote me on that one.</p>

<p>I wonder what would happen if they were to go looking for the <em>now</em> 21 trillions missing..</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The point is that it was USED or ALLOCATED for something secret</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The point is that it wasn&#39;t used or allocated, it was in the accounting. If tomorrow you write down in your personal accounting logs that you had won $21tr dollars, you now have $21tr in accounting errors. The article you read sensationalizes and an already sensationalized Forbes report, stacking misinterpretation on top of exaggeration.</p>

<p><a href="https://media.defense.gov/2016/Jul/26/2001714261/-1/-1/1/DODIG-2016-113.pdf">Here&#39;s the source report</a>. Essentially the total value of accounting errors, whether they be inflow or outflow of funds, whether they are numerical errors, system overlaps or not documented up to standards. They attribute most of this to the fact there are two antiquated software systems the army uses for their accounting, entries are often inconsistent between the systems. The forms automatically generated by the systems are often incorrect, and allow users to proceed without providing the full supporting documentation.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s a story here it&#39;s that the army have awful software for accounting and don&#39;t train their staff to properly fill out forms. The fact that the number CURRENTLY matches up to the current national debt is purely coincidental, given that the report is for a period of 17 years up to 2015 (when the national debt would NOT have matched up with the number), and the US has been accumulating national debt for FAR longer than that. It&#39;s also pretty unlikely that the military managed to spend 4-5 times their budget, on top of their actual documented budget. But if they did, do you really think you&#39;ll learn about it in a publicly available government report?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hah, nope. Agreed. I would say that total different source of income needs a tax overhaul. 
I get you already paid tax on that money you earned, but you just earned more money without doing &quot;anything&quot;, and I use that loosely...We begin to value nothing over hard work. Wealth becomes so artificially inflated that its status in society is not actually representational compared to those who work &quot;hard&quot;.</p>

<p>Point is, excessive wealth is bad for a society and economy, wealth is not. What and who determines the parameters that define excessive is the kicker.</p>

<p>It is a cost/benefit thing - like they tend to ignore people who are $25 short on their taxes. Maybe they avoid the big fish because they can tie it up in the courts endlessly? Although I don&#39;t know the first thing about tax law, that&#39;s probably not it.</p>

<p>But in this case I do lean away from a conspiracy angle. In all likelihood it&#39;s just a broken system with perverse incentives, and any &quot;conspiracy&quot; is an effect rather than a cause. Just how I look at it from ignorance, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you completely missing my point, and I doubt that 95% of the people you know are in as good of health as you think. For example, I bench over 330 lbs, can run 2 miles in about 15 minutes, and am fairly active. That said, I&#39;m about 32% BF and weight 342 lbs. Out of  the people I know, I&#39;m more healthy than quite a few. Which is pretty sad considering that I&#39;m technically obese. I would say that I&#39;m probably average for health in the US and as I&#39;ve lost weight and gotten healthier (I&#39;m down about 37 lbs int he last few months) I&#39;ve really started noticing how unhealthy everyone is. Just looking around at my coworkers, most get winded walking up a flight of stairs and sit around drinking starbucks all day. </p>

<p>YMMV but America is a very unhealthy place, and the fact that I thought I was healthy and &quot;OK&quot; really shines a light on it. All of our food is laced with sugars and salt, and our mentality is looking for our next high or feeling of endorphins from social platforms. Our population can&#39;t focus on an issue for more than a few days before we&#39;re looking for the next thing to follow/complain about/etc. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not entirely sure why you&#39;re calling me out, I&#39;m not claiming to be outside the system (I&#39;m paying for internet service to be here), but I am trying to point out that the pieces of legal paper stating ownership or value in a monetary sense only have credence because <em>we</em> as a society agree they are valid and have value. We could just as easily agree they don&#39;t have value or matter, but that of course would require a majority of people to go along with that. As divisive as society is today, the likelihood of that happening is quite low.</p>

<p>But if as an individual one were to not want to interact with society, they could always be a hermit. Or if one were to want to interact with society but <em>only</em> on their terms, then they could be an outlaw. I can&#39;t think of any examples beyond that.</p>

<p>One could become a hermit, I don&#39;t think it is against the law to remove oneself from society and live alone. I could very well be wrong though. Or one could be a criminal which is kind of not playing by the rules by definition</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stop working your job, and let me know alive you are in a few months.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How could I do that without money to pay for internet access (and hardware) to communicate to you my living conditions? On a side note: it is possible to survive without a job but the quality of life is diminished, but it isn&#39;t a death sentence as you seem to imply it is. It is just a lifestyle too difficult for most. </p>

<p>That you can&#39;t imagine what it would be like to live in such a manner doesn&#39;t mean it is death to those that do. Most people in the world don&#39;t live with the level of convenience that we do, it doesn&#39;t make them worse off necessarily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where would you live? How would you leave society? What you&#39;re described is squatting, and it is indeed very illegal. There is not any land who is not &quot;owned&quot; by somebody. What do you think happens to petty criminals? You sure wouldn&#39;t be some kind of criminal mastermind or underground cartel lord.</p>

<p>Ok, so what are you going to do for food, water, etc.? Arguably the people you&#39;re describing have jobs, as panhandlers. Is your plan of &quot;living off the grid&quot; to stand on a corner and ask others for their currencies? You can&#39;t just go make a garden somewhere and sustain yourself, and if you did it would only be until whoever owned the property swept you off.</p>

<p>Yes, there are many places that don&#39;t have the &quot;conveniences&quot; we have here. However, here, many of those &quot;conveniences&quot; are mandatory to survival. Without a vehicle, internet, etc. it&#39;s near impossible to make it on your own anywhere in the continental US. Even people living in the most rural areas rely on others who have those &quot;conveniences&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where would you live? How would you leave society? What you&#39;re described is squatting, and it is indeed very illegal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You walk into the bush and live off the land in an area without humans (there are still wild places in the world where people don&#39;t frequent, believe it or not). Those areas exist and it is very much possible. Just because you can&#39;t fathom it doesn&#39;t mean it is impossible. And it is only squatting if you&#39;re caught at it. Is there a large force that wanders the back-country in search for squatters I&#39;m not aware of?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, so what are you going to do for food, water, etc.?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you want me to teach you how to survive? Go take a class or find a teacher in your area. If you don&#39;t know how to do it, it doesn&#39;t mean it is impossible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can&#39;t just go make a garden somewhere and sustain yourself</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because that is just impossible...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, here, many of those &quot;conveniences&quot; are mandatory to survival.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mandatory to survive with the quality of life <em>you</em> currently are accustomed to. But your definition of survival is not accepted by all. I survived quite well without internet or a vehicle for years before I decided I wanted those things. I wasn&#39;t living like a pauper during that time either. <strong>Again</strong>, that you can&#39;t related to imagine such an existence does not mean it is impossible to do without.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m curious as to what exactly you think you could do off grid ? Or how you would even get &quot;off grid&quot; in the first place?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m curious why you think that an on grid existence is the <strong>only</strong> way to live. As to what <em>I</em> personally would do, I would live. But understand that <strong>I am not</strong> saying all people should live in such a manner nor am I trying to force any into living in such a way (nor am I claiming to live in this manner). </p>

<p>I am saying that legal papers, either representing ownership or monetary value, are only given value and validity through societal agreement. If a majority of people decided that weren&#39;t the case, then those documents and paper would cease to mean anything.</p>

<p>As to how to get off grid? One simply has to wander into the back-country and they would find themselves off the grid. It really isn&#39;t more complicated than that. The map <strong>is not</strong> the territory. ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, you&#39;re being completely hypothetical and not realistic. Do they exist? Sure. Where would you go? Where is this haven you&#39;re after? Are you going to use your &quot;conveniences&quot; to find it, or are you going to just walk around hoping to find it? It&#39;s not a matter of not being able to fathom, it&#39;s being realistic. Lets say for example I live in Idaho, there is quite a bit of uninhabited land. However since Idaho is a desert, most of that land is literally sand and dirt. So with no cover from weather, dirt/sand constantly blowing across flat land, and no reliable source of food/water, where would I go? Do I drive my car to Utah and hope it&#39;s different? Why am I driving my car if I&#39;ve given up modern technology? How am I paying for the gas in my car? Am I going to also produce my own oils to burn for energy?</p>

<p>I can very well survive with little supplies in the mountains however long term survival with none of our modern &quot;conveniences&quot; isn&#39;t the same thing. I think that you&#39;re downplaying the harsh reality of &quot;living the land&quot;</p>

<p>Having a garden isn&#39;t impossible, however having your own mini-farm hidden away makes you not being &quot;found&quot; harder and harder. </p>

<p>So how long ago was it that you &quot;survived&quot; without a vehicle, internet, etc.? You literally can barely even apply for jobs without internet anymore. It has become as much of a staple of society as running water or electricity.</p>

<p>I think that you&#39;re taking what I think is possible and misconstruing what is feasible. If there was some kind of apocalypse, I have no doubt that I would survive for quite some time. However, the things you&#39;re mentioning as possible and feasible simply are not in a modern society especially in the continental US.While there aren&#39;t people actively &quot;looking&quot; for squatters, you can bet that some passerby would report you as suspicious or strange to local police. Hell, I&#39;ve done it myself to people who roll up in their cars and sit on the curb for days because I didn&#39;t want a squatter outside my driveway.</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with whether or not paper does or doesn&#39;t have value. It has to do with expectations of trade. For example, I am a SysAdmin, lets say that you wanted computer work done but you didn&#39;t believe in money, so you had to trade me something else for my services. Am I going to want your potatos? Probably not, since the amount of potatos you would have to pay me would go bad way before I could use them. If I assume a lb of potatos is $.89 and I normally charge $75/hr, for one hour of work it&#39;d be almost 85 lbs of potatos. This is part of why we have currencies. Because I don&#39;t want that many potatos, with currency I can use it on whatever I actually DO need.</p>

<p>The issue isn&#39;t with that people see value in money, it&#39;s that currency is a necessity to trade and bartering skills. The issue that you&#39;re referencing is that our currency is no longer backed by something tangible like gold or silver, instead it is backed by overhead debt.</p>

<p>Good luck &quot;wandering&quot; somewhere &quot;off grid&quot;. Eventually you&#39;d have to either A) get back into currency to get what you needed B) get kicked off whatever land you decided to stay on and potentially lose all your work or C) end up in some kind of institution whether it be jail, mental, etc. </p>

<p>Nope, I was attempting to say we all collectively agree that such things have value or are valid. I never talked about backed currencies.</p>

<p>You are making this all very personal, so I must assume this is a hot button for you. I apologize for any misunderstanding, I was not trying to single you out nor attack you. I do not appreciate how personal you are trying to make this.</p>

<p>But since we&#39;re getting personal, do you recognize how limited your view point is? Do you not acknowledge that perhaps reality is different for people <strong>not</strong> you and that perhaps the things you take for granted are not as ubiquitous as you might imagine?</p>

<p>I have never said money was pointless nor implied it. <strong>I am not</strong> advocating primitive lifestyles nor unconnected living. I am pointing out it is possible to live like that, and yes it is difficult. Please stop <strong>reading your bias into</strong> my responses as that is quite annoying and does not further reasonable discussion.</p>

<p>I would also like to point out that what you think is feasible only advertises your lack of skill outside of your obviously urban microcosm. It also advertises your absolute dependence on modern society for not only your survival, but also basic comfort. I feel bad that you never thought to garner the skills necessary to live without modern novelty and your precious convenience. </p>

<p>I am being hypocritical btw, since I am obviously indulging in this decadence to have this interaction with you. But since you&#39;ve decided to make this about me, how about you recognize your own limited perspective and notice that what you think is &quot;essential&quot; is really a decadence you obviously don&#39;t fully appreciate.</p>

<p>Please feel free to write me another wall of text telling me how wrong I am and in what way I&#39;m wrong. </p>

<p>Good luck. :)</p>

<p>Grandparents were farmers under Stalin. They owned a big house, electricity was no charge &amp; under Stalin they were required to donate part of their crops to the community because of the terrible mistaken advice given by his top geneticist Trofim Lysenko that created the poor crops &amp; starvation that killed so many.</p>

<p>My grandparents were happy to do that as were all the other farmers in their area.</p>

<p>All my Uncles &amp; Aunts to this day......even under Russian capitalism.....if their neighbor can&#39;t afford to pay the electricity. It won&#39;t be disconnected for at least 2 years.</p>

<p>Under Putin... sister in law has had two children, the first she was given 10,000 rubles in addition that child birth is free there (No bill) for her second child her husband &amp; her were given their own apartment free for having the second child.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not double standards, and it&#39;s not the IRS&#39;s fucking job to hold anyone accountable for anything. The IRS collects revenue - full stop. They do not distribute or allocate or audit funds. Their own employees are known for not paying their taxes and they barely can pin the delinquent employees down enough to not let them have cost of living raises if they&#39;re not paying taxes. Think about that for a second. </p>

<p>Distribute and allocate, that&#39;s Congress&#39;s job 100%. It&#39;s Article fucking 1 of the Constitution. And each executive branch office has their own OIG office and Congress has the CBO to evaluate if the money given to parts of the government are used appropriately.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not really missing and when it says can&#39;t account for, it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s spent on unknown things or secret black ops etc... It just means that the original summary expenditures doesn&#39;t match the actual expenditures and so it indicates a possible problem. It also doesn&#39;t differentiate between expenditures that are actually just copies of themselves which happen when projects change whether it being from moving between departments, changing of names/codes, changing of companies etc... </p>

<p>For example 20 billion can be spent(allocated) on a single defense project and for some reason that project changes hands from ARMY to Air Force. The original documentation shows the ARMY being charged 20 billion for the project and now there&#39;s another document that shows the Air Force being charged 20 billion for a project. On paper the government spent 40 billion on a single project but in reality it only spent 20 billion. The ARMY was originally charged 20 billion for it but after it changed hands the Air Force took the bill instead. The reason it looks like 40 billion was spent is because these investigations go after top level accounting reports and NOT all the paperwork that is filed afterwards. This same project change can also cause a number of other accounting problems since on paper the ARMY was charged 20 billion for the project which was written off on their yearly budget as was the Air Force and in some cases this allows the ARMY to spend another 20 billion somewhere even when the budget doesn&#39;t allow for it. This can then indicate on paper the army spent 40 billion with 20 of it being over budget and 20 of it being from this project that changed ownership. At the end technically 60 billion was spent but in reality it wasn&#39;t and the funding just moved around a bunch. In this case an accounting correction would have been issued somewhere in the massive pile of paperwork in both of the departments but to get to it would mean processing everything else until that point which would make accounting irregularity algorithms(systems designed to notice irregular spending) absolutely impossible to use at any usable speed. The reason why it&#39;s not a &quot;big deal&quot; is because this is a well known issue and is almost always being investigated through the use of regular audits which flag any issues internally that need to be dealt with. The original top level inquiry isn&#39;t fixed however since it would be redundant. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also a massive issue with the way the government does contracts where companies bid on projects where the government by design must pick the lowest bid. Companies will under bid and make up the difference in profit by requesting more funding later on by claiming w/e excuse they want. When overages happen the government does calculations on whether to change companies or not. It&#39;s complex and revolves around a lot of court costs, rebid process costs, ownership rights over materials researched/designed, etc... which almost always results in the overage being authorized. Just look at aircraft development for example. It&#39;s also not always the fault of the company as departments can ask for changes as the project progresses which results in massive changes in design that greatly affect original intended cost i/e the F-35 where the requests changed the intended simpler design and cross compatibility between departments and resulted in vastly different designs for each purpose. These cost corrections are also not top level reporting which causes the same problem as described above where original documentation doesn&#39;t match expenditures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically yeah, it&#39;s not really an issue since budgets have been kept for the most part. It&#39;s just really impossible to have a government that is able to function while also double, triple, quadruple etc... checking every single piece of paperwork that is created. Just think how much stuff the government does and think how many people would have to be employed to go over every single line of text. As for tax flow, it&#39;s a lot less paperwork since all it requires is a paycheck and an equation both of which are performed by either and or the employee/employer. If an investigation is needed to see if you owe more taxes than you will need a lot of paperwork to account for where you got money, what you spent it on, etc... which takes a lot of time and effort to do. It&#39;s not asked for all the time though because of how impacting it would be on every individual. It&#39;s a pretty good example of the difference between reporting and operations. Reporting needs just bulk explanations of things while your day to day operations are all the paperwork, receipts, contracts etc... which is rarely ever actually needed but comes in handy when it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no incompetence going on other than premature news articles that are lacking in research on how systems function and what data is actually being looked at while disregarding context. The system(s) are doing exactly what it&#39;s supposed to be doing which is finding irregularities that are then investigated and dealt with. The articles are only looking at top level reporting i/e the original documentation without any changes that happen with just about every single program that has ever existed, and actual money spent. They are doing this by looking at the various reporting functions that exist which are open to the public&#39;s eye. The public doesn&#39;t get ALL paperwork because of numerous security reasons. </p>

<p>Thanks to the system having lots of redundancies and bureaucracy in place every single program has an almost endless amount of paperwork that can be referenced IF a problem is ever found. This is done so IF a problem is found and it turns out to be a crime those responsible can be arrested as they would have to do an insane amount of paperwork in order to completely hide illegal activity thanks to the above mentioned massive amounts of redundancy and bureaucracy. It&#39;s also done so when an explanation is needed it can be found. Not all paperwork that is filled out is processed and inspected all the time because it would be almost impossible to have a functioning government due to the amount of money/man power needed to do such things. It&#39;s mostly just in case of a need to be inspected i/e a problem or irregularity is discovered that warrants inspection. In general as long as the government is spending within the budget no problem is expected and so mass inspection isn&#39;t warranted.</p>

<p>This accounting issue is just a difference between the various functions/systems that are in place to prevent problems from occurring many of which do not function together but instead rely on each other to perform their job. Such systems like(these aren&#39;t the actual names of each program/system it&#39;s just simple summaries of concurrent coexisting checks and balances that exist which don&#39;t always share data all the time but instead rely on each other to flag possible problems/issues) budget proposal processes, government contract procurement, governmental auditing, department of defense requirements and functionality, government expenditures and reporting, etc...</p>

<p>Basically it&#39;s comparing a system that reports expenditures in the government to a different system that is procuring contracts from companies and asking a government to pin point the exact specific reason why there is a difference. The government needs to go through the paperwork to give the answer but in reality since the numerous systems that are in place haven&#39;t flagged anything than it&#39;s simply asking for a non-existent problem to be dealt with. Since the budget has been pretty well controlled than it&#39;s assumed the money is as well. It just takes some time to wade through specific paperwork to give specific answers when nothing has been flagged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is similar to what many gigantic companies deal with. The unaccounted balance is +- too.</p>

<p>For instance, I did a lot of work for a very very large train company. The client would be furious if you didn&#39;t bill the whole budget, even if you came under budget. Why? If you came under budget it screwed him in one of two ways. The accounting Dept had a difference to now sort out and was annoyed at him as it often got lost in the chaos, or like govt, the boss would just make sure to give him less money next year.</p>

<p>Either way, if you were under budget or something changed, the guy would usually just prefer you found ways to bill the amount you quoted.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a scale problem, and the US govt is the biggest organization on the planet, so that scale problem is just bigger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The part I would add to this is the only reason banks have to borrow from the Fed (overnight rate) is because of the way the laws are written. Fractional reserve banking = requiring only a minimum (10%) to be on deposit (total bank client deposits) to settle claims (withdrawals). First, member banks borrow from each other at the discount window, then go through the Fed to settle up. It’s why we have to order our own money when we withdrawal say 50k in cash. </p>

<p>If this didn’t exist I think banking would be a much different experience for most of the public. Yes it’s needed, but ads to inflation, the cost of money, money supply multipliers, and a host of other things affecting our financial system which is the best in the world - but at the same time has inherent cost built on a vig mentality that taxes each step along the way. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Our national debt is what we as a people owe to the US Federal Reserve</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The national debt is $21 trillion, but only <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/current/h41.htm">about $2.3 trillion</a> of that is owed to the Federal Reserve. The rest of it is owed to other institutions, governments, individuals, and to other parts of the federal government (such as the Social Security trust fund).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Without this debt, there would be no money in circulation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Buying debt is the main way that the Federal Reserve introduces new money into the economy, but it&#39;s not the only way. The debt it buys doesn&#39;t have to be federal debt, either. The Federal Reserve can also buy private debt. Currently it owns about $1.7 trillion in mortgage-backed securities. Before 1933, the Federal Reserve mainly bought debt in what is today called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_market">the money market</a>.</p>

In short, most military tech is produced in the public sphere then used in top secret programs; for example the Pentagon is not going to be a better developer of processors than something like Intel. Much of the Pentagons missing money goes to pay for projects that contractors go overbudget on, but then isn&#39;t put on the books to avoid corruption charges and to keep the money flowing into those pockets.</p>

Sort of like, embezzlement but there&#39;s no record of it at all. </p>

<p>It just gets funneled off like embezzlement before it is known. So the money cannot be missing to the public only the few who know of it.

<p>secret UFO projects</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And now we have these &quot;trustworthy&quot; CIA and pentagon officials latched onto poor Tom Delonge, increasing the drip-rate of partial disclosure. When asked about craft that &quot;defy physics&quot; or move at speeds which would involve G-forces which a human cannot handle, they consistently give no other explanation than that it is likely extra-terrestrial/non-human. Yet there are many examples of technology that sought to dampen G-forces (which would make a human flying such craft a very real possibility). Quite suspicious. Makes me more inclined to believe Werner Von Braun and Steven Greer about an upcoming UFO invasion that would be blamed on aliens. And in reality it would be a false flag, humans from our civilization, not aliens, piloting UFOs which were built in secret with the trillions of missing dollars over decades (via USAPs that not even the president is allowed to know about. Recall JFK and Eisenhower&#39;s speeches on secrecy and the MIC). Decades in which popular culture has been led by the movie industry to believe that UFOs would be manned by aliens/non-humans and that aliens would be malevolent/hostile. I wonder how blatant the next alien invasion movie will be. Will it try to say that the only way to stand a chance is to unite under a single government, a NWO?</p>

<p>I&#39;m under the impression that anything that has been seen and classified as UFO is simply humans and the several Governments dedicated to R&amp;D to continue to push the limit.  It also of note, that there hasn&#39;t been anything impressive beyond a rocket that can push a shuttle  into space.  No new fuel development beyond rocket fuel. There are ion engines but that about as high tech I can think of that works. </p>
