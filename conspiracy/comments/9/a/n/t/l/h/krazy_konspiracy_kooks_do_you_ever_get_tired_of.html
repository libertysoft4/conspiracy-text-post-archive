        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When I first came here a few years ago, I loved it, it was like a dumping ground for some of the craziest whacked out shit on earth.</p>

<p>I never knew how inclusive crazy could be.</p>

<p>When I wrote about the end of life on earth yesterday, one person expressed concern for my mental health. LOL! My mental health is nothing compared to the end of life on earth. If you aren&#39;t disturbed by it, then you are delusional.</p>

<p>Humanity has to reduce emissions 50% in 10 years to stay below 1.5 C.</p>

<p>James Hansen says 1.5 C = Dangerous Climate Change</p>

<p>Look outside your window. What do you see?</p>

<p>You see dangerous climate change. </p>

<p>It&#39;s already here. But it gets worse.</p>

<p>To stay under 2 C, we have to reduce emissions 100% in 20 Years.</p>

<p>James Hansen says 2 C = DISASTER</p>

<p>You see, between 1.5 C and 2 C, there are 5 huge tipping points set up like dominos, if one falls, they all fall. It gets worse.</p>

<p>There are 13 huge tipping points in all, and if the first 5 fall, the other 7 will fall too. When this happens, earth will enter into runaway planetary heating. It gets worse.</p>

<p>The planet is set to change magnetic poles. All the ice at the poles is melting and sending water to the equator, making earth fatter, and slowing down its spin. This will open us up to space and solar radiation. It gets worse.</p>

<p>All the melting ice is triggering massive volcanic and earthquake activity. There are 97 newly discovered volcanoes under the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. They are melting the ice from below. That ice sheet has entered a runaway state that cannot be reversed or stopped. It gets worse.</p>

<p>Humans and livestock are 97% of all vertebrate biomass.</p>

<p>10,000 years ago, humans and livestock were 0.03% of all vertebrate biomass. It gets worse. Here&#39;s where we are now.</p>

<p>Humans and livestock caused 80% of species loss.</p>

<p>99% of Rhinos gone since 1914.</p>

<p>97% of Tigers gone since 1914.</p>

<p>90% of Lions gone since 1993.</p>

<p>90% of Sea Turtles gone since 1980.</p>

<p>90% of Monarch Butterflies gone since 1995.</p>

<p>90% of Big Ocean Fish gone since 1950.</p>

<p>80% of Antarctic Krill gone since 1975.</p>

<p>80% of Western Gorillas gone since 1955.</p>

<p>60% of Forest Elephants gone since 1970.</p>

<p>50% of Great Barrier Reef gone since 1985.</p>

<p>40% of Giraffes gone since 2000.</p>

<p>30% of Marine Birds gone since 1995.</p>

<p>70% of Marine Birds gone since 1950.</p>

<p>28% of Land Animals gone since 1970.</p>

<p>28% of All Marine Animals gone since 1970.</p>

<p>This is the biggest conspiracy of your life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we have to reduce emissions by 100% in 20 years I think it&#39;s safe to say we&#39;re fucked.</p>

<p>But, joking aside, this is very serious stuff. I&#39;ve had a very hard time talking to people about it, because everyone of my friends instantly divert the conversation toward the question of what ratio of human influence to natural processes are actually involved in climate change. It&#39;s very easy to find natural processes that sound like they should have a massive influence, such as the lifecycle of the sun, or what galactic neighborhood we might be passing through. </p>

<p>These sorts of diversions seem like psychological defence mechanisms that absolve us of any responsibility, and make it difficult to discuss actual solutions, and actual methods, which would help alleviate the issue, which we could all do, personally. I&#39;m certainly far from perfect in this regard but I&#39;m making an effort to learn more about it so I can further improve in the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We as humans just learned how to not completely kill each other for pointless reasons every 50 years, about 80 years ago, and even then we&#39;re not great at it. We can&#39;t even agree that people have a right to life or not<sup>1.</sup> In order to enact most of the changes required in order to keep the planet habitable for us, if climate change models are correct, we would need to, as a species, focus pretty much all of our energy to make massive changes that inherently are not profitable or easy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s then not at all unreasonable for most people to pretend everything&#39;s going to be fine when they know or are presented with evidence their world is going to end within their lifetimes.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the basic extinction theory. If we say a giant asteroid heading for Earth and we know for a fact that we are not going to be able to stop it or move it, do you panic? Do you throw everything at the problem, hurting or destroying your life now for an insignificant chance at lessening the disaster? Or do you just enjoy what little life you have left?</p>

<p>More importantly, would you want to know the world is ending, or would you like to continue to live your life in ignorant bliss?</p>

<p>Alternatively, say you have a terminal disease that does not effect your day-to-day life until you die painlessly. Would you want to know about it and worry, or would you want to enjoy your life without that thought nagging in the back of your head?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a problem, but it&#39;s not carbon.  A single moderate-sized CO2 release from a volcano is larger than all the CO2 we&#39;ve created since the industrial revolution.  If our contribution made a difference, the Earth&#39;s climate would have to be pretty fucking unstable.... and it is unstable, and it does fluctuate between tropical and ice age... but very slowly.    </p>

<p>Something is different about the sun, or maybe the atmosphere.  Remember back when the Sun was yellow, instead of blinding white?  Remember back when you had to tel kids not to stare at the sun, rather than not having to tell them because looking in the sun&#39;s general direction is immediately painful?  Things are different now than when i was a kid in the 80s.  They keep saying it&#39;s getting hotter... and in recent years it is... but summers were hotter in the 80s.  90 degrees was normal summer temp, upper 90s to 100 was &#39;heatwave&#39;.  Now upper 80s are normal temp, and 90s are &#39;heatwave&#39;.  It&#39;s a few degrees cooler now... but that angry fucking sun BURNS ME.    </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what it is.  I don&#39;t know if the ozone layer is fucked, or our atmosphere is otherwise screwed up, or if maybe the sun is hotter (or just a larger portion of IR from the sun).... but it&#39;s something.    </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a biblical in scale apocalyptic scenario for you--  More UV from the sun (either sun change, or ozone layer gone).  Top layer of ocean life gets killed.  Oceans turn red from cyanobacteria bloom.  All coastal cities become uninhabitable from toxic wind.  Billions starve from loss of sea produce.    </p>

<p>But no one talks about that.  We&#39;re all just wrapped up in silly environmental shit.  Like plastic bottles.  Lets not use plastic water bottles, because there&#39;s an island of plastic floating in the Pacific.  Know what&#39;s on the other side of the Pacific (and I&#39;m talking to you, California)...?  China, who has flammable rivers and toxic death clouds over their cities, and Japan who dumps huge barges of trash in the ocean, because they&#39;re a tiny crowded island with no room for landfills.  Which side of the Pacific do you REALLY think that shit in the ocean is coming from?  Nope, its our fault, and we need to feel guilty.  We need to sort our recycling too, because they definitely don&#39;t dump that shit into the same landfill.  Lets go back in time 100 years to the time when garbage wasn&#39;t tied up in in plastic bags to keep away flies and disease.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, I think zero point energy exists. Cars can run on water. These technologies will be unveiled when enough of the corporate dictators running the world decide how to transition from an oil-based economy into one based on renewable energy. This is what I think the carbon trading market was set up to do (continuing the cash grab without having to actually produce anything), but until that&#39;s implemented then we are where we are.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe much in the existing models outlaying ecological destruction because they project based on current trends. Yet... nothing stays current. Innovation is always happening, and models naturally fail to account for incredible technological breakthroughs. </p>

<p>Plus, some of the most famous ecodoomsday&#39;ers have been straight-up wrong: Just ask Al Gore and <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2013/12/31/258687278/a-bet-five-metals-and-the-future-of-the-planet">Paul Ehrlich</a>. Malthus too, for that matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Magnetic Pole Shift: that’s unrelated to climate change. If it’s going to happen soon, nothing we’ve done caused it. </p>

<p>2) The Earth getting “fatter” because of the ice caps melting and thus slowing down the planet: this is BS. The effect would be so small you wouldn’t notice the effects for a billion years. The earth has only had ice on the caps for something like 5% of the past 2 billion years. </p>

<p><a href="http://jonova.s3.amazonaws.com/graphs/lappi/65_Myr_Climate_Change_Rev.jpg">Look at this graph of Earth’s average temperature over the past 60 million years.</a> The earth has been much warmer, you’ll notice that right now the earth is especially cool. The planet and life will handle warming. And they’ll be fine without us. </p>

<p>The two things that really concern me are 1) the mass extinction of animal life, especially megafauna; and 2) the decimation of the land. Cities, suburbs, and farms cover all the world’s arable land. It’s horrible. So basically all species that once lived on those lands are at minuscule populations compared to normal. Oh and 3) an anoxic event caused by the rapid warming. </p>

Dont worry I heard an Exxon Ad and they said they are “making oil smarter” by making it “last longer” with “new technology” and claiming they are “finding the best alternate energy solution”. Exxon really just told me they are making better energy choices by literally doing the same shit with new words?? Is that how dumb americans are? We see it with Memes everyday.

    <div class="md"><p>The sea level rise will hurt humans and little else, but the problem with the excessive carbon is the acidifcation in the oceans, THAT is the bad one - no animals, no us.</p>

<p>But in all honesty, there will have to be a decision made on whether to: </p>

<p>1 - Advance human technological progress at all costs (little care for emissions) so as to help us escape Earth and terraform Mars, and hopefully outweigh the effects in the future.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>2 - Create a massive federalized United Nations, police environmentalist policies, work on reduction of birth (or genocide if you believe in FEMA camps) and create a fascist, albeit incredibly sustainable socialist society.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>3 - Hope to fucking god that in the next 30/40 years we can continue research that can catalyze with CO2 to remove it from the atmosphere, or just simply reuse it as fuel and create a sustainable carbon cycle again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are attributing too much climate change. Climate change is the norm. I believe man&#39;s intrusion into what were formally wilderness habitats and the corporate dumping of toxic waste into the environment is far more damaging than the natural rise and fall of temperature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, lets rumble the foundations here.  so first off- yep. planet is getting hotter. yeah, mankind probably has something to do with it- the statistics are pretty clear when it comes to stuff like CO2 and pollution etc. also true that all kinds of species are dying and so on. undeniable and accurate. wew. but herein lies the real crux of the matter:
Ever walk out into the ocean and try to hold back a wave? didnt have much luck, did you? this wave is already rolling in, and even if you were somehow able to seize control of the ENTIRE WORLD and try to put a stop to the manmade contributions, you would fail. because the wave is already heading up the shore. its done. we cant reverse these things. we can stem them, slow them down, but its irreversible. so where does that leave us pitiful humans? 
First up- gotta get over it. the generation in charge of the planet fucked the future generations hard, but it cant be undone. you can sit in the corner and be bitter, but that doesnt accomplish much. so what can we expect? The good news is that the planet has actually been a lot hotter, several times before, even as recently as a thousand years ago. we can absolutely live through this. As far as species dying out etc? yeah, that&#39;s a thing, but that wont have nearly the impact on our food sources as the initial reaction might suggest. the wealthy elites wont get their rhino meat, but the rest of us will still have plenty of beef, pork, and chicken. Crops? well, we may not be able to grow them in the same places we used to, but they will still be a thing. i would expect the best areas to move towards the north and south, and more temperate climes. the global ecology has shifted several times throughout various ice ages, and can easily do it again. </p>

<p>The last big factor in this is the people. time to cowboy up- get used to the heat. stop using so much AC (only makes things worse). you may have to leave your ancestral lands behind and go elsewhere. you may have to follow the jobs. but the good news is that humans are incredibly adaptable. we can get through this. it&#39;s nothing the planet hasnt gone through before, and we are more than capable of managing our own destiny here. </p>
