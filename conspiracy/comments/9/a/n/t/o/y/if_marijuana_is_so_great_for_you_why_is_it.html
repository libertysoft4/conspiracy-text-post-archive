        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>for starters, im not against weed at all, i smoke it often and have been for the past few years and it has helped me deal with a fair amount of shitty moments in my life. and im a little high right now. however, i find it hard to believe that it’s as medicinal and healing as people make it out to be. most people know that burning anything and breathing it in isn’t good for you. and if it’s medicinal, then why are we being encouraged to do it recreationally as well? medicine is not for recreation and you don’t take it for fun. moreover, there are studies showing that it’s not great to smoke if you have a compromised respiratory/cardiovascular/immune system, so how is it really good for others? even though it may not make you lazy it makes it a lot easier to be not productive. honestly i think it’s just something that is being taken over by corporations, if it isn’t completely already (Constellation Brands which owns Svedka and Corona just invested 4 billion) basically now they can control everything including our weed and get to make more money doing this, all while most likely harming out health in the long run. any other ideas welcome!! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one said SMOKING weed is good for you. Marijuana has proven medicinal benefits but it must be used correctly to prevent others. Same with a lot of over medications. It’s not marijuana’s fault that it can also be enjoyed recreationally like alcohol. If alcohol has medicinal benefits would people not be allowed or “not supposed to” drink it recreationally? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>good thing alcohol doesn’t really have strong evidence of any medicinal benefits except for possibly one chemical in wine which is in other foods, not just alcohol. </p>

<p>Alcohol and it’s metabolites are POISON. and has very strong scientific consensus that it is a human carcinogen according to the cancer.gov website. the risks associated with cancer are completely downplayed by a blanket surgeon general warning saying “...may cause health effects” </p>

<p>the reason why marijuana was demonized yet we saw synthetics being developed was because it does have potential medicinal benefits but the FDA has strict guidelines that in order for a medicine to be “therapeutic” it has to have a consistent dose and potency and as we know cannabis has many different variations and strains with different chemical makeups. it being in schedule 1 made it more difficult for scientists to grow, study, and do clinical trials. now that it’s being legalized or medical programs being extended they can finally do the research without all the bureaucratic red tape. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>why do you believe medicine shouldn’t be recreational? i don’t believe that’s true at all. especially in cases of psychedelics including ibogaine, ketamine and mdma. recreational but with profound and long lasting effects on certain mental health issues. i didn’t waste my time typing that out because people DO believe alcohol has proven medical benefits i.e news reports flooding outlets that say a glass of wine is as good as an hour in the gym. it never has and it never will be. you know there has to be people out there that will go, “i just had three glasses of wine, that’s like three hours in the gym.... right?” </p>

<p>just because YOU know alcohol has no proven medical benefits doesn’t mean everyone else does. and why even use it for an example and pretend it does just for arguments sake. that’s counterintuitive. </p>

it’s all gonna be okay. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a simple question to answer! There are many reasons it is being legalized at this time. People want it and at the same time it will help pacify some of the populace. It is a Hugh cash cow right now and will be for the next few years.(Benefiting the government/ Taxes)  The populace were not being fooled any longer with the &quot;no medicinal&quot; label that was put on it. There are many more reasons for what is happening. Think in the terms of control and benefit.... Who does this help and who is benefiting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Published physicians in the nineteenth century recognized cannabis as medicine. While my reference refers (haha) to pills for headache, smoking does help some people with &quot;nervous exhaustion&quot;.</p>

<p>1889:
Yale-educated Dr. George Beard diagnosed a nervous exhaustion he attributed to “living in civilization” (neurasthenia).</p>

<p>For this (“Sick Headache”) he prescribed the following pill:</p>

<pre><code>Take a pill of cannabis indica (Indian hemp). Repeat in half an hour if necessary, or double the dose. This remedy sometimes succeeds when caffeine fails, or when caffeine has worn out its virtue by long use.

… The following pill :
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>Extract of cannabis indica, ½  drachm (2 grams), guarana, 1 ½   scruple (1.87 gram), Citrate of caffeine, 1 drachm (4 grams)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mix, and make into sixty pills.Take one pill and repeat the dose in one hour if necessary.</p>

<pre><code>” Sick headache is one of the most common and most annoying of the nervous maladies of our time. It visits every family, and at one time or another attacks nearly every individual.”
</code></pre>

<p>Dr. George Miller Beard, M.D.</p>

<p>(neurasthenia is not presently in the DSM)</p>

<li><p>Edibles. 2. Tax revenue.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on what I know about tobacco companies (which is a lot), I assume the only reason it&#39;s been illegal this long is that the alcohol and tobacco industries kept it illegal because it&#39;s better than both in these ways: a. Not as addictive. b. Not as obesity-producing. c. Because not as addictive, not as disease producing.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Edibles avoid the whole lung cancer, throat cancer, etc. cancer issue that smoke brings to the table. Of course, until massive numbers of people are consuming marijuana edibles for decades, we won&#39;t know what, if any, unintended side effects will occur.</p>

<p>At this point, the societal cost of tobacco (especially) and alcohol (to a lesser extent) have gotten too high, so we&#39;ve reached the tipping point towards legalizing marijuana.</p>

<p>It is not harmless to everyone. But it is harmless to a larger percentage of people than tobacco or alcohol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really just wasted time typing all of that. No shit alcohol doesn’t have medicinal benefits. I was just saying IF IT DID would people not be allowed to enjoy it recreationally because the OP was saying it’s weird that marijuana is being used as medicine but also being legalized for recreational purposes as well and medicine isn’t supposed to be recreational lol. </p>
