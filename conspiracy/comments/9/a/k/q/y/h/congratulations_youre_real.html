        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You&#39;re in a crowd, looking around you notice everyone&#39;s eyes are fixated on the main event, Who else is looking around? Who else is being aware, conscious of their surroundings? Maybe a few, maybe they&#39;re not recording on their phone, maybe they&#39;re wearing clothes you&#39;d wear, maybe they make eye contact... They&#39;re real. The thing is, thinking about the fact you&#39;re thinking, and thinking about the fact other people are thinking is a real persons trait. Don&#39;t get me wrong, people are real biological living beings, however, I don&#39;t believe they function above the reptilian brain, they follow, they obey, and get mad when you argue with the blatant truth, denying all factual evidence with brainwashed beliefs and stagnant ideas.</p>

<p>These sheeple don&#39;t think about things beyond them, they stay focused on the now, and near future never worrying about anyone or anything but themselves. (More fake than real, that&#39;s why this world is crumbling)</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Right now you&#39;re probably like &quot;how do you know for sure you know for sure&quot; well basically I have signs (coincidences) that are honestly 1 in millions, its hard to explain really, I just get small hints that make huge impacts: &quot;Hey pick that up someone will need that soon&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t move the thing they just told you to move because they&#39;re gonna change their mind&quot; So many other types of hints beyond small things, seriously I can&#39;t explain its beyond me, literally.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>You can obviously tell higher awareness from almost apelike semi-conscious sheep, it&#39;s in the things they do, the things they say, even the things they wear and listen. The sheep don&#39;t have souls, they don&#39;t move on, they go to the empty nothing that science describes. We exit our physical forms, connecting to the vast multiverse that we all created (this is just one server on Gmod basically) we&#39;re the admins that turned off God mode; eventually, you want to play a game without cheats because it gets boring; you want to truly experience the reality you created.</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>I&#39;ve lived my 18 years feeling alone with this vast abstract understandings; watching people use their fleeting energy towards these emotions we create; aguing, craving, false suffering, Etc. All these things are in the way of the true path for you, let go of how others make you feel, forget your needs/wants just experience what comes to you, acting on your first instinct; jumping on random opportunities without bias. Stop smoking so (much) weed, stop smoking nicotine, stop drinking everything but Water, and a few others. Stop eating anything that doesn&#39;t come from the ground, stop second-guessing. Start accepting, start loving.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is futile but i&#39;m honestly so bored...</p>

<p>If i wanted to make this a short story I would&#39;ve gone on, on how someone was going to type how presumptuous I was being with my &quot;knowledge&quot; The fact of the matter is you don&#39;t grasp my understanding of the predetermined scripts/consequences that result from actions. I do; you&#39;re one of them.</p>

<p>Im begining to think i&#39;m like the first man to say the earth revolves around the sun, just one of them things man, some people have it and others don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Ive lived bro lol that was presumptuous, in fact im needing a quick 18 wheeler to the face because i&#39;m bored. As you can see i&#39;m filling my time with pointless paragraphs to someone who doesnt care. Im ready to move on my man...</p>

You’ve got a lot to learn brotha, you’re just learning though, you’ll get past this egotistical all too sure if yourself phase soon enough and have a more realistic less judgey and self righteous outlook on things. But in the mean time try not to take things so seriously, and don’t get too big headed. Just let people be and do what you feel and know is best for yourself and others, don’t be too preachy, and just be chill my mans. You’re gonna make it</p>
