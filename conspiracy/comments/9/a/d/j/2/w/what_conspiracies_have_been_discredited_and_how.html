<p>What does this even mean?

    <div class="md"><p>Ah thanks dude! Yeah I did write it. I never went to uni, ended up dropping out of 6th form so I never got the chance haha. But physics was always one of my favourite subjects and as soon as I was out of school I spent so much of my free time educating myself on topics and at a pace that I preferred. Funny thing is, in school I always failed in essay classes. It wasn&#39;t until I was out and actually started writing essays for fun that I begun to understand the concept of proper formatting to get to a point via easily-followable logical steps. </p>

<p>1) going to the moon is technologically impossible in 2018. it was also technologically impossible in 1970.</p>

<p>i had to be told 3 times that the moon landing was a hoax before i even started to look into it</p>

<p>a little background on where I&#39;m coming from...</p>

<p>many years ago, i was just a curious person reading some things that made me have questions, and when you have questions, strangers seem a little too eager to provide answers</p>

<p>and so began an endless debate that started and stopped with dozens of various users from all different places and backgrounds </p>

<p>often we would touch on a few topics, and then move along, never really fleshing out all of the questions that emerge </p>

<p>but after a while it did seem that the entire argument could be summarized by a series of story problems, organized in a sequence where the logic builds upon previous questions </p>

<p>so instead of trying to start in the middle of a debate, and having to type the same thing I&#39;ve typed a dozen times already  </p>

<p>i just laid it all out once, took a screen shot of it, and share it as an image. you can find my name in the top right corner </p>

<p>the reason that this particular &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; is so important is because it destroys the credibility of so many pillars of establishment </p>

<p>&quot;Flat Earth&quot; is a classic. You got a third, fourth, even thirteen-hundredth party with evidence that debunks the conspiracy? Too bad, cuz &quot;they&#39;re ALL in on it!&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Santa and Nazis are a perfectly example of why Flat Earth fails, and requires the infinite spiralling of &quot;then I guess the conspiracy is THIS more capable, THIS more powerful etc&quot;. Kids get spoiled on Santa constantly. The Nazis had info leaking for years and still got caught. </p>

<p>Flat Earth argues either every nation (or &quot;the true power&quot; in every nation) working together to flawlessly prevent information exchange across the entire planet and supposedly (and I&#39;d say, necessarily) for literal centuries. Every institution on the planet capable of fielding an airplane, a ship, a fleet of drones, or developing/operating space technology is either in on it, or duped as well, without any serious evidenced dissent whatsoever.</p>

<p>And all of it with a very vague proposed rationale that doesn&#39;t do justice to the monstrous undertaking something like that would have to be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah thanks dude! Yeah I did write it. I never went to uni, ended up dropping out of 6th form so I never got the chance haha. But physics was always one of my favourite subjects and as soon as I was out of school I spent so much of my free time educating myself on topics and at a pace that I preferred. Funny thing is, in school I always failed in essay classes. It wasn&#39;t until I was out and actually started writing essays for fun that I begun to understand the concept of proper formatting to get to a point via easily-followable logical steps. </p>
