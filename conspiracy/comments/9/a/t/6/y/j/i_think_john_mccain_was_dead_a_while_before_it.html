If on a private island or in someplace like Antarctica he wouldn&#39;t even need that. And as far out as this seems to some it is totally plausable. Lets wait and see how many times &quot;no name&quot;  haappens to come up in the near future during all the endictment testimonies. He may have just needed an escape.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Party wise the republicans are not seeking re election and retiring in all elected offices in record numbers. Wonder why. Not saying they are all bad people, just the majority of them. Same with the democrats. Being a self centered crook with self serving agendas has no party lines. Neither is being a traitor serving a secret world domination organization. I believe the majority of both parties has been corrupted for decades. I believe they go into office corrupted already. But thats just me, and this is why I want all the names made public with all the investigations being conducted now and in the future. I think Trump has been nice and &quot;professional&quot; to a lot of these people and allowed them to leave or be prosecuted. I dont agree with this. I want the names, I want them denied any public service for life and I want them so ridiculed that their families have to change their names and deny any relation to them. This is the justice they deserve and chances are with the  corrupt court system its the only justice we Americans will ever get. No mercy, no immunity, no more secrecy. It ALL needs to end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s common in hospice.  Not that nurses are that blatant, but there’s the unspoken understanding that your loved one is in pain.  A little opiate dose would put them to sleep, until they wake up confused and in pain again.  You can keep that cycle up for a year while they waste away, but most patients end up dying of respiratory failure long before that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lost my father a few years ago.   My Step mother (his second wife, she was great for him btw)  was at the time and still is a nurse.  While I can attest I was not aware of anything administered to hasten his death, watching / hearing him death rattle for 2 days was hard.   Looking back , the other nurses kind of told us , I&#39;m sure my step mom understood.  </p>

<p>That and conversations with my step mom lead me down many paths, but you come to find out  assisted suicide has been going on for years, centuries even (Socrates and hemlock) it&#39;s just not talked about openly.   If you have a close family member who is a nurse or doctor who might be exposed to end of life care ask them, I doubt you&#39;ll ever get an on the record answer because they could be out a job, but they might hint at the truth.</p>

<p>This article here corroborates it.  </p>

<p><strong>McCain’s Death</strong></p>

<p>The official version of events is that McCain died of a deadly Glioblastoma,<br/>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma</a><br/>
where death usually follows in 12-15 months. It was announced he had brain cancer in July, 2017 – 13 months ago (a well-planned event). McCain previously fought deadly Melanoma<br/>
<a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/melanoma_skin_cancer_of_us_senator_john_mccain/views.htm">https://www.medicinenet.com/melanoma_skin_cancer_of_us_senator_john...</a><br/>
skin cancer – so he was cancer prone (a well-planned excuse). Despite supposedly having radiation and chemo treatments, McCain didn’t look a day older in March, 2018 than he had in 2015. He died at home, where the circumstances of his “death” could be well controlled and concealed.</p>
