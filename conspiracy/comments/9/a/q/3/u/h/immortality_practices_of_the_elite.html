<p>Immortality is real and has been utilised by the elite for centuries.
This story goes back to the Sumerians and they&#39;re gods.
Sumerian high priests were shown by the gods how to prepare 
the &quot; Old man becomes young &quot; plant, or flower of life.
It was considered an honour.
The priests weren&#39;t allowed to ingest the plant themselves,
that was reserved for the gods, but they could drink the water
it was prepared in. Extending they&#39;re lives.
The priests eventually passed this knowledge on in code, the locations of the flower of life, it&#39;s preparation. Preserving this knowledge.
An important point is high priests had to have
&quot; The patches of priesthood &quot; a skin condition which resulted 
in patches of scaly skin on the body. ( The origin of reptilian men.)
Something the priests attributed to the gods. </p>

<p>As well as the flower of life there was Muppu. 
A mineral composition that extended life, first used by
the Tamil Siddhars and was used by the gods,
its preparation also taught to the high priests.
This eventually became &quot; The philosophers stone &quot;
and when in its liquid form it is blood red.</p>

<p>By the time the Sumerian civilisation ended all this knowledge
wound up in the hands of scattered blood cults, passed onto them from the priestly class.
But misinterpreted and misunderstood.
The cults themselves formed from the mistaken understanding 
drinking blood would make them immortal. 
They had heard stories passed down of the gods
drinking red water and taken it to mean blood.
When in fact it was muppu in it&#39;s liquid state.
This was the start of what we now call the &quot; illuminati &quot;.
An ancient blood cult.
The locations of the flower of life, muppu, and they&#39;re 
preparations were successfully passed down through the blood cults, but were coded by they&#39;re ancestors the high priests.
After centuries a few in the blood cults cracked the codes and went looking for the flower or muppu. Those who succeeded
became some of the first elites within they&#39;re cults.
Extending they&#39;re lives for centuries, 
becoming &quot; gods &quot; to mortal men.
These elites didn&#39;t tell the lower ranks that the gods were not drinking blood, deciding to keep this knowledge for the 
privileged few.
A whole new system of passing this knowledge down was created,
and compartmentalisation was used to protect and reserve it
for the most long term and loyal members of the cults.</p>

<p>The cults networks survived being adapted into other civilisations.
When the Egyptian civilisation arose some of the 
priests came from the old blood cults,
and the elites from these cults would grant muppu 
for some of the pharaohs.
Amon who had knowledge of muppu from the blood cults
used it to create wealth and establish himself as a &quot; god &quot;
he taught the priestly class lots.
which was in turned passed down.
Over the millennia off shoots from the old blood cults formed
the Egyptian priestly class passed down what they had learned from the cults, resulting in different groups with different agendas.
The birth of secret societies.<br/>
For centuries from the start of the old blood cults
the lower ranks were never corrected about drinking blood
and this continued practise influenced the other forming groups.</p>

<p>The ancient networks of the old blood cults remained inbeded
within all the different groups, they&#39;re knowledge from the
Sumerian high priests preserved in code.
Over time the few privileged elites who gained immortality became myths 
within the lower rank of these groups who were still practising
blood drinking.</p>

<p>The quest for immortality is at the heart of many secret societies,
who gained knowledge from the old blood cults.
The networks of the old blood cults are still around today,
they are the origin of many secret societies whether they know it or not.
The few elites who were granted immortality by previous elites
in the cults are also still around today.</p>

<p>Knowledge of the flower of life and muppu, passed down from Sumerian high priests is the starting point of an immortal elite class within civilisation. With this knowledge passed down in code
available to the very privileged few, who are granted immortality
the old blood cults have successfully influenced the world for millennia and will continue to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But at what point do we stop asking for evidence when it&#39;s not there and we are all still in the theory stage? Can&#39;t provide something that doesn&#39;t exist yet. We have to work and debate things together as one to get the full story. We are all playing connect the dots to a history we are not privy to and only rich, powerful elites have access to. God could be fiction yet a lot have faith he is not despite lack of evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, i agree with that.  Except my problem here is that OP isn&#39;t making speculation at all, he&#39;s presenting this as pure fact; &quot;<em>Immortality is real and has been utilised by the elite for centuries.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>Then offering no evidence.  That&#39;s all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the accounts from these cults, blood cults, saturn cults, death cults, all the same thing with different names, all basically say the same thing.  There was forgotten knowledge encoded by a priest class and passed down through secret societies, the Mystery Schools.  The Saturn Cult story says these secrets are astrotheological.  Death Cults say these secrets are spiritual.  Blood Cults say they&#39;re related to immortality/genetics.  Likely all different terms for the same concept.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t supply you with a singular source, nor can the OP.  This post is more a series of connecting dots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Image you control the world. You control the money supply. The hierarchical structures. You control the people, the masses..... When you have everything under your thumb and you&#39;re every material desire is satiated. WHAT is the next step exactly? From material goals you go to &quot;spirtual&quot; goals. Well this is what certain small groups of people on this earth are faced with. Over the centuries they&#39;ve gone as far as making up their own &quot;religion&quot;/belief system to make them feel like the things they have done are necessary, or OK. They think in terms of posterity, advancement and enlightenment for themselves. And yes because of their thought process there are rituals and cults and &quot;magic&quot; and secret societies and all that jazz. That&#39;s all a given. Problem is, they&#39;re all dead wrong. They&#39;ve essentially brainwashed themselves. Separated themselves from every living thing around them and fooled themselves by fooling others. They desire everything, not just material wealth but wealth in spirit. It&#39;s a fruitless cause and they are simply destroying themselves and the human species, as well as life on the planet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is the truth; I&#39;m glad you wrote what you did. I try to stress on this subreddit just how truly insane and delusional the &quot;elite&quot; (the hierophants of the mystery schools, the extremely rich, those in &quot;authority&quot;, the lowly initiates) actually are. They have absolutely convinced themselves that their goals are pure, but in reality there is nothing benevolent about despotism. They have convinced themselves that they are gods, which is something only a true psychopath or moron could believe. And while there may be some true elements to magic, their understanding of it is certainly incomplete. And their &quot;magic&quot; is the tactics of brainwashing and control, initiation and ritual that keep the deception machine churning. This system serves to nourish the ego and to continue releasing unthinking pawns into society. They know they&#39;re wrong and that&#39;s why they need the secrecy; it&#39;s why they need to exile their thoughts through the esoteric. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s truly ironic is that You can never Die.. I mean that Literally! </p>

<p>That&#39;s what&#39;s so incredibly funny about all of this.. everybody is so afraid.. they think it&#39;s all going to go black and they&#39;re going to turn into worm-food. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to say it again. Your body will surely expire, but YOU are not going to DIE.</p>

<p>This is the big secret being kept from everyone.</p>

<p>You are literally immortal information and energy.. pure awareness. 
I&#39;ve been to the other side of the veil, I&#39;ve conversed with the deceased as have tens of thousands of other people. I&#39;ve seen their bodies restored to perfection, their heart and mind balanced.. radiating perfect equanimity and compassion.</p>

<p>But science is like nope, can&#39;t measure it..can&#39;t find it with our antennas.. it&#39;s all just anecdotal bullshit. 
Ok, don&#39;t listen.. carry on with your childish antics that make you miserable. 
Sure, ..you&#39;re just a holographic hallucination of spiking neurons.</p>

<p>All these supposed &quot;scientists&quot; like Richard Dawkins leading everyone astray.. too chickenshit to look for and heaven forbid.. actually find God. 
Why look when he knows he doesn&#39;t exist? Ah, there&#39;s that good ol&#39; &quot;science&quot; of our age..</p>

<p>If he&#39;d shut up and sit still for five minutes he&#39;d know the truth.. but he&#39;s too ashamed at the way he&#39;s carried on to face him at this point.. too invested in his ego and desperate to hold onto his worthless scraps of &quot;knowledge&quot;.  </p>

<p>God is not hiding from you,.. it&#39;s you that&#39;s hiding from Him! </p>

<p>What&#39;s really crazy is all these people behaving out of fear and greed thinking that they&#39;re going to &quot;get away with something&quot;, entirely unaware that everything will be known.. everything will be brought to the Light!  </p>

<p>You have no privacy in a Loving Universe where everything, all souls are connected and you are but a mere fragment of the whole. 
What do you think happens when you encounter another soul on the other side? 
They instantaneously feel everything you&#39;ve been through and they share with you everything they&#39;ve experienced. 
Your personal experiences are the fundamental currency over there. </p>

<p>You really think the Divine Creator is ok with injustice?
Nope. We are the entertainment for higher kingdoms.  </p>

<p>When you finally know the truth and see it with your own eyes it&#39;s truly hilarious the way people carry on. Almost every single film is about avoiding death and staying alive at all costs.. the frantic fearfulness the black magicians try to instill in the populace.. </p>

<p>Tom Cruise going berserk to keep his little body alive. He would outrun his own grandmother to get away from a bear.. nothing too shameful so that he can remain a living coward!</p>

<p>It&#39;s impossible to relate to and everyone gets so mopey when someone &quot;passes away&quot;. Did you have the guts to kiss them and tell them that you loved them when they were on this plane.. right in front of you face? </p>

<p>Newsflash: We&#39;re the ones that are trapped in the fishbowl of time and the &quot;deceased&quot; feel sorry for us.. They have the superior, birds-eye view.  They&#39;re right here rooting you on, watching your back.. do you really think you&#39;re doing it all yourself? 
You would&#39;ve been taken out by a bus or bird droppings long ago..</p>

<p>All these so called &quot;elites&quot; behaving in despicable ways to eek out a few more years with a rotting container while their ancestors look on in embarrassment. </p>

<p>You will be given exactly as much rope as you desire.. to hang yourself with. </p>

<p>Have fun with that :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, there are two tracts on this theme of extending one&#39;s life. </p>

<ol>
<li>Blood transfusion as mentioned here (practiced by Illuminati today, Dracula, and maybe Sumerians(?))</li>
<li>Ionic rejuvination: Known to be practiced by Ancient Kemet and the ancients that Ponce de Leon who searched for many years in/around Florida under commissioned by king Ferdinand and queen Isabella of spain. </li>
</ol>

<p>Everybody on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> seems to think that Pizzagate is some child molestation ring, but I honestly think it is about blood transfusions rather than being sexual. But nobody wants to believes me. Too evil I guess, but it has been proven that a blood transfusion will bring back all your youthfull functions. Even in Germany it is popular to do a version of this process by mixing ozone into your blood. </p>

<p>I also assume the legend of Dracula and Transylvania may have been founded in this practice, however much quack (or real?) science it may have been. </p>

<p>Personally I prefer looking more into the ionic method and how to strengthen the hypothalamus gland for anti-aging. I would recommend you do the same. </p>

<p>Trying to get someone elses blood could just as easily cost you your life and an early death. lol </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Siriv are human beings who are quite aware of the aliens here on Earth, and put the alien agenda ahead of humanity&#39;s best interests. These people work hand in hand with the Kayeen predominantly, but also other species that are part of the Consortium.
The reason the Siriv betray their fellow humans is greed and selfishness. They are sociopaths hand picked for their willingness to have &quot;flexibility&quot; with their morality.
Our children in school are tested each year, presumably to verify their mastery of each subject. But there are also &quot;personality tests&quot;, &quot;I Q tests&quot; and &quot;reasoning tests&quot;, or test questions within standardized tests, aimed at spotting these sociopathic personalities.
Unless they are Siriv, most educators are unaware of these alien manipulations of our children&#39;s tests. Teachers pass them out, collect them and turn them in. Principals do likewise. Computers verify scores, but they also show which &quot;trigger questions&quot; were answered which revealed sociopathic tendencies.
An example is, &quot;You are told by your teacher or parent to do a task that you believe is wrong. Do you:
A. Obey. Your teacher/parent has authority over you. You should do what you are told. They know more than you do.
B. Refuse. You object to the task and will not do it because it violates your personal moral code.
C. Compromise. You try to find a way to do the task without going against your personal moral code.
D. Avoid. You agree to do the task but then avoid doing it instead.
E. Seek reward. You agree to do the task, but only if you are rewarded for doing it.&quot;
They prefer A or E children, obviously. Easily controlled humans who can be manipulated to do things against their own best interests, or the interests of humanity, or those who will compromise ethics for profit have sociopathic tendencies.
Sometimes, the most structured places like the armed forces, where all those in service are trained to obey no matter what, is a place they recruit Siriv.
What starts as amazement and feeling honored to be &quot;brought in&quot; to the greatest secrets of our world can gradually be manipulated to a situation in which the Siriv are willing to do anything asked of them, no matter what.
All Siriv must sign non-disclosure forms with prosecutable punishments that are quite intimidating. It used to be &quot;keep it secret for 50 years, in which time most are dead. Now, there is no end time to the secrecy.
Siriv at first are told that they are doing things for humanity&#39;s own good. Humanity cant handle the truth, society would collapse, most people aren&#39;t &quot;special&quot; enough to learn these secrets, etc.
The Kayeen who direct them are in drop tech, so the Siriv are mostly unaware of how aliens look, until they are well trusted.
Killing innocent people who get in the way of a mission is not a problem for the Kayeen, and they order Siriv to kill, cover up, steal, misdirect, intimidate, etc. to complete their tasks for the Consortium agenda.
The men in black are Siriv working with drop tech Kayeen for the most part. These &quot;first response operatives&#39;&quot; job is to cover up alien discovery. Short term memory of civilians are wiped. People are threatened who see something, or told that they could cause their family or friends to be put in danger if they talk. Cameras, cell phones, computers, radar, print outs, etc. are confiscated and never returned.
Siriv are very well paid, often in gold. They have access to astonishing medical care, and are given multiple innoculations that do who knows what to protect them, or so they are told. Most are tracked with under the skin tags. After critical missions in which they learn too much, their short term memories are wiped as well.
Some Siriv eventually want out of the program. They are usually bribed with such offers, they can&#39;t refuse. For those who start to leak information, they are set up to take a fall, are jailed with false charges, or are given diseases or mental damages like Alzheimer&#39;s, a stroke or heart attack to marginalize them. Some are murdered but set up to look like suicide. Others just disappear and their family&#39;s are left wondering what happened.
The Siriv are in most governments, and critical industriesin the world. They are wealthy, arrogant and look down on their fellow man, just like the Kayeen. Lying becomes second nature to them. They know the world will be hurt, but as long as they and their families are protected, they don&#39;t care.
In the U.S., there are bunkers deep underground full of supplies and gold in preparation for nuclear war. If war breaks out again and nuclear weapons hit the U.S., the Siriv and families will simply go underground and wait it out, then return to the surface when it becomes safe again without suffering.
The Siriv are the enemy of humanity. They are knowingly bringing us to our ruin, enacting orders without hesitation. The Kayeen could not control us as they do without the help of the Siriv.
When the Assembly arrives, the Siriv will be judged harshly for their disloyal and inmoral actions. But we must answer the beacon first in order for that to happen.
An example of Siriv is Joseph Mengala. He created experiments on twins and other Jewish prisoners during WWII in order to advance scientific objectives of the Consortium. What shows how compromised he was is his lack of remorse for the things he did against fellow humans.
We must root out these selfish, betraying Siriv if we want to slow down the Consortium</p>
