<p>Recent economic stagnation or slow collapse has patterns. Governments and banks, and many so called professionals encourage bubbles, and when the bubble pops eventually, banks get away destroying many people&#39;s lives, governments just fire some ministers and that&#39;s it, big companies get aid from tax money and survive, while all the ordinary civilians and small companies lose so many things.</p>

<p>Worse part is, 1% or 10% rich people exploit this pattern. They buy real estates or business when economy collapses, buy things for very cheap price and become more rich.</p>

<p>This is becoming a pattern and getting worse.</p>

<p>Eventually ordinary people will be equally poor. While middle classes slowly die out.</p>

<p>I heard conspiracy that 1% rich people are doing this on purpose, to eliminate middle class. Because middle classes have opinions, they have power over politics, they have time and energy to think about the rotten system and the world.</p>

<p>Everytime small collapses happen, 90% people will start to beg for the Mcdonald job, 10% will be richer and swallow everything. Oh then there would be true Dystopia we used to see in the movies.</p>

<p>Am I too paranoid?</p>

<p>No. I don&#39;t think its a matter of if, but when. It might be a long ways off still, or maybe not. Regardless, I suggest having some level of preparedness for an economic collapse, and for what could potentially come after depending on how bad it gets.</p>

<p>Yep, exactly. Players who still have lots of cash when a market is bottoming out are the ones buying all the cheap resources from the smaller players who have to get out. Then they let the market go back up, and do it all again.</p>

<p>While the dollar-equivalent values of the owned stuff fluctuates, actual ownership tends to migrate toward the big players, and it&#39;s owning stuff that&#39;s important.</p>

<p>This may be one of the most insightful pieces I&#39;ve ever read throughout the years. Truly grateful you took the time to share this. </p>

<p>I had been discussing conspiracy theories with a retired engineer recently and he vehemently asked me to look into the scientific method. So I did. Afterwards, I told him how I felt that was the exact approach I took when researching any of these theories. Although I&#39;ve reached a conclusion a long time ago, this really wraps up my &quot;hypothesis&quot; with a nice shiny bow on top.</p>

<p>Thanks again for sharing. It is not in vain. Peace &amp; Love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This</p>

<p>She observes, for example, that many liberals have missed the point of strategies like privatization. Efforts to “reform” public education and Social Security are not just about a preference for the private sector over the public sector, she argues. You can wrap your head around those, even if you don’t agree. Instead, MacLean contends, the goal of these strategies is to radically alter power relations, weakening pro-public forces and enhancing the lobbying power and commitment of the corporations that take over public services and resources, thus advancing the plans to dismantle democracy and make way for a return to oligarchy. The majority will be held captive so that the wealthy can finally be free to do as they please, no matter how destructive.</p>

<p>MacLean argues that despite the rhetoric of Virginia school acolytes, shrinking big government is not really the point. The oligarchs require a government with tremendous new powers so that they can bypass the will of the people. This, as MacLean points out, requires greatly expanding police powers “to control the resultant popular anger.”  The spreading use of pre-emption by GOP-controlled state legislatures to suppress local progressive victories such as living wage ordinances is another example of the right’s aggressive use of state power.</p>

<p>Could these right-wing capitalists allow private companies to fill prisons with helpless citizens—or, more profitable still, right-less undocumented immigrants? They could, and have. Might they engineer a retirement crisis by moving Americans to inadequate 401(k)s? Done. Take away the rights of consumers and workers to bring grievances to court by making them sign forced arbitration agreements? Check. Gut public education to the point where ordinary people have such bleak prospects that they have no energy to fight back? Getting it done.</p>

<p>The way I see it these people took advantage of the economy and its rules and used this to situate themselves into economic power. How does then destroying the economy itself help them whatsoever?</p>

<p>Just curious what the end goal would be</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they can make the bubble again and recover the price of cash, and they call it &#39;economy recovery&#39;. It&#39;s same with stock market, they make the market plummet and buy the stock for cheap price, then suddenly skyrocket the price(they are capable of that), innocent people buy stocks thinking the market is alive again, then the riches sell theirs while ordinary people enjoy bubble fantasy.</p>

<p>Just my opinion. I bought a stock for small amount and witnessed what twisted game &#39;they&#39; play with the market.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep in mind money is just misplaced trust.  </p>

<p>Most people go to work and get paid every 2 weeks, with the first paycheck withheld.  Meaning you work 160 hours before you&#39;re paid for the first 80.  You do it all under the trust that the money you earned last 2 weeks will get you by the next 2+.  </p>

<p>We trust money and the enormity of the system, over our neighbors.  If people lived near people they trusted they&#39;d have communities and people to lean on as well as less crime.  Instead we base everything around worshiping money to save us, living where it&#39;s cheapest and the cheapest to commute to work, and hoping we&#39;ll retire and sell our house to never work again.  </p>

<p>My mom was likely the last generation to enjoy that &quot;American dream&quot;.  She had help to buy a house even when it was feasible to do yourself (make $60k to pay for a $90k house, isn&#39;t difficult), sell the house for $300k 15 years later and retire.    </p>

<p>Except that means I now need $300k to buy the house my mother was able to, but even if I took over her career I wouldn&#39;t make 3x what she did to be able to achieve the same things.  </p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t even include the fact that this makes rent usually costs 2-3x a mortgage and prevents people from even reaching the savings point to buy a bubble-house</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the economy in the US has been a train wreck for at least a decade. they, being the elite, know this, and know that its just a matter of time before the USD looses its cozy little reserve currency crown.</p>

<p>they are all prepared for it just like they were the 2008 crash or the crashes before. they all know the only ones who are going to get fucked over this time, like always, will be the poor and working classes.
imo Trump was given a green light because it will be easy to blame the guy who brags about not being part of the club for it all despite the fact these problems were all created during prior administrations.</p>

<p>basically automation strips the working class of their useful role to the elites, which in turn means they no longer need a middle class, so why bother maintaining one? </p>

<p>its much easier to control the working poor who are basically chained to their minimum wage jobs for survival than it is to deal with a middle class that can actually afford to protest and refuse their labour.</p>

<p>basically western capitalism is failing for 90% of the people but setting that top 5-10% up really really nicely. *note i said western capitalism, which is this crony run crap we have, not functional capitalism that we have had in the past.</p>
