<p>Not to mention the extreme Us vs. Them divisiveness: The enlightened “patriots” versus pretty much everyone else (“These people are sick!”).  The opposition are all chid-trafficking Satan worshippers. What is this really all about it?</p>

google q proofs, first one that popped up was qproofs dot com 
there is a lot there, 
but you should start reading from the very beginning of his posts</p>

<p>in fact, if you can do what Q did. maintain a following like he does, i&#39;ll even say if you can get just 3 thousand followers, believing what his followers believe, I will give you 3 thousands. but if you can&#39;t, you have to give me 3 thousand. we will set this up in a smart contract on ethereum. i&#39;ll match whatever amount you wanna put up.</p>

The question is what is the motive behind it- as far as I can tell, Q has connections to the Admin, and is likely sanctioned by them at the highest levels- Q themselves is likely a member of the Admin.</p>

<p>So the question is, is Q a psyop from the Admin to keep their base strung along through the midterms and into 2020, is Q what they claim, or is Q something else entirely? The only thing I feel certain about is it&#39;s not a random LARP...far too complex for that. What we&#39;re dealing with is a psyop- but the kind is yet to be determined. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This NBC article above posits that a man named Coleman Rogers is mostly behind the Q stuff. From the article: </p>

<p>&quot;One <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/TrumpCampaign/1MnGnekEprkKO">archived livestream</a> appears to show Rogers logging into the 8chan account of “Q.”The Patriots’ Soapbox feed quickly cuts out after the login attempt. “Sorry, leg cramp,” Rogers says, before the feed reappears seconds later.</p>

<p>Users in the associated chatroom begin to wonder if Rogers had accidentally revealed his identity as Q. “How did you post as Q?” one user wrote.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbecyoqCm0c">another livestreamed video</a>, Rogers begins to analyze a supposed “Q” post on his livestream program when his co-host points out that the post in question doesn’t actually appear on Q’s feed and was authored anonymously. Rogers’ explanation — that Q must have forgotten to sign in before posting — was criticized as extremely unlikely by people familiar with the message boards, as it would require knowledge of the posting to pick it out among hundreds of other anonymous ones.&quot;&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is correct. Its a PsyOp, but alas, so is Trump and his election...and so is Rosanne Barr and MeToo and Kathy Giffords, Stormy Daniels, etc.....and even Lionel Nation. The murderous, sycophantic, greedy global elite play on many levels and Trump is simply another layer of the onion. The Zionists put Trump in power as they knew he would be divisive and they could shape their divide and conquer agenda around him stateside while still carrying out their global domination plans overseas while the American public were at each others throats. All is going to plan and the false flags and divisiveness will continue as the Zionist controlled MSM and Hollywood pump out the narratives while the Deep State makes its moves.</p>

<p>&quot;The Show&quot; America is watching right now is similar to &quot;The Watergate Show&quot; during the Vietnam War. Watergate stole the limelight and pushed the war, 59,000 dead US soldiers and a million dead Vietnamese citizens to the back burner. </p>

<p>All was made invisible, same as the media circus now covers up US support for the Ukrainian Nazis, Libyan jihadists, Syrian terrorists, Saudi head choppers, White Helmet terrorists.....kept out of the limelight and made invisible now. Even Reddit is taken over by them. Cass Sunstein told you it was going to come down to this. Its distraction 101, as taught at the elite schools along with the Hegelian Dialectic. Order from Chaos. No lie is too big to tell. Simply keep creating the history while the dupes are busy trying to figure out the previous event. </p>

<p>Kissinger whispers in Trumps ear, same as he does Clintons.......and Sanders. They are all Zionist puppets.....sheepherders. They mock and censor the naysayers (Truth Revealers) now to keep the entire charade from unraveling in this fast transmission Internet world.</p>

<p>Trump words are meaningless as proven by the fact that everything he stated before the election has now been inverted. He is letting them unravel his admin, as was always planned. The Show will soon require that his role be retired and The Show will still go on with a new marionette.....likely Pence. The censorship will grow stronger and AI will shut down dissenters in the near future. What the Zionist controlled Deep State has done to other countries has now come home to roost on the American people. They play you for fools and have been orchestrating all this for a very long time. No one needed Q to figure this out. A simply look at who benefits and following the money would quickly reveal the truth. </p>

<p>But hey, neither would exactly 5, 10, 15, or 20 days be. Or exactly 7, 14, 21 or 28 days. And 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 days cannot be a coincidence either. We are now up to 50% of days that are not a coincidence. </p>

It would be trivial for “Q” to make even a single prediction that was definitive. Instead it is an endless series of ambiguous word salad posts that add up to nothing.

<p>Yes, he predicted <em>something</em> significant would be in the press relating to McCain and this <em>something</em> happened exactly a month (less an hour, possibly due to Q screwing up time zone/DST) from when he stated it would. The odds of that happening are off-the-charts.</p>

<p>Some <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-Probability">math</a>.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s guess that 50 out of the 1932 drops reference No Name (could be more, but probably less):
* 50 / 1932 = 0.02587991718 chance a post&#39;ll be about McCain</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say from when Q posted then was a likely death of McCain within 60 days:
* 1/30 = 0.0333333333 chance of the post being the same month day of death</p>

<p>Let&#39;s factor in the post&#39;s minute (and leave out the hour):
* 1/60 = 0.01666666666 chance of the post being made the same minute of death</p>

<p>Let&#39;s calculate probability of this occurring, based on this:
*  0.02587991718 * 0.0333333333 * 0.01666666666 = 0.00001437773 = 0.00143%</p>

<p>One one thousandth of a percent of a chance of happening.</p>

<p>Factoring in the nearness of the hour, assuming the post was 3 hours off:
* 24 / 3 hours = 8 ... 1/8 = 0.125</p>

<p>So 0.00001437773  * 0.125 = 0.00000179721 = 0.00017972162%</p>

<p>Pretty low.</p>

<p>&quot;No Name&quot; is the nickname he normally uses for McCain (hence it appearing under the picture of McCain). It&#39;s derive from the view from some military that, given he&#39;s considered by some to be a traitor (doing propaganda for the Viet Cong), &quot;we don&#39;t say his name&quot;.</p>

<p>You&#39;re wrong here. I have, I just choose to ignore it. Think of all the literary greats, considered classics- trust me, they&#39;re all fucking awful people.

<p>Yeh fully. He was a dickhead. I changed my view on him since my teens. Guy was an asshole who wasted his talent by partying too much, and treated people like shit.

<p>I don&#39;t really consider him a hipster icon... he&#39;s got a book that&#39;s considered a classic, so chances are if people like his books, they&#39;ve got a similar taste in books. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Odd question mate! Orwell was an anti semite, I like hip-hop and pretty much every rapper has done awful stuff, Bowie was a paedophile, I guarantee Tarantino is some kind of predator, I like some of Jonny Depp&#39;s films but he&#39;s an abuser of women, a lot of authors I like were addicted to all kinds of drugs and were horrible to women- Burroughs, Kerouac, Ginsberg.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I have less problem with people who mainly harm themselves, or whose victims are to some degree culpable, than predators and, to a lesser degree, folks that advocate self-destructive mindsets.</p>

<p>Part of it is, I think, getting older. I used to be pretty nihilistic so, feeling that way, I had no issue with nihilistic artists. In getting older I realize my personal failings and how I got where I am: nihilism. So I see the real cost of the mindset and the stakes of it culturally.</p>

<p>And, in being less nihilistic than I used to be, I take the societal danger of &quot;monsters&quot; more seriously. I&#39;m confident that I&#39;m capable of doing the worst things you can imagine (although I would probably end up blowing my brains out, too, like HST) so it&#39;s, perhaps, realer to me than for someone who isn&#39;t wired that way. I believe that &quot;monsters&quot; are used and fostered by power to control society and that if society ignores this and doesn&#39;t counteract it these folks will, increasingly, push our society towards historic &quot;norms&quot; (in which horror was much more commonplace, like Rome in decline).</p>

<p>I dunno, his personality appears to be addiction-prone, and confrontational. Nothing to suggest he&#39;s into snuff stuff. The anecdotes are from 2 or 3 people... I just doesn&#39;t seem credible to me. If I see evidence, I&#39;d believe  it of course. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d agree in part. It elevates degeneracy in the same way the blues did, or jazz did, or the bands of the early 60s did. Music&#39;s progression has always been linked to pushing the boundaries of perceived degenerate behaviours. It&#39;s not exclusive to rap. </p>

<p>I guess in a sense I&#39;m a nihilist. I feel that while we&#39;re on different ends of the political spectrum, we both see things for how they are. That all institutions are corrupt, for example... the UN. The fucking <em>Olympics</em>. The police. Huge charity organisations like Oxfam. All of it. And the same with artists. I&#39;ve accepted that all artists, famous ones, are probably &quot;bad&quot; in some way. At the very least, they&#39;re all raging cokeheads. </p>

<p>I feel that ultimately you&#39;re talking about societal moral decline, am I right? Because I&#39;ve got a whole lot to say about that, but don&#39;t want to waste my words if that isn&#39;t what you mean. </p>

<p>There&#39;s garden variety financial corruption and then there&#39;s a higher level of corruption, the realm of snuff and such, which reenforces the financial corruption because people who partake in it can be controlled and blackmailed.</p>

<p>You can call it Pedantry but most normal people call it Accuracy.</p>

<p>He has. Do your research. Trust the pan. </p>

<p>I, again, am not implying he’s guilty of selling or distributing or looking at child porn.

So stupid that he was kicked off of the site that allows basically anything.</p>

<p>Yes, Q. It’s not a “he’s in it for the money” argument. It’s a “if he was really a top secret government insider patriot he wouldn’t need to monetize the movement” argument.</p>

<p>There are tons of things I’m only in for the money. I’m not stupid. Money makes the world go ‘round. </p>

<p>Don’t bother replying unless you plan to address what’s being said instead of saying irrelevant shit that just shows you have the level of reading comprehension one would expect of someone who trusts that the word of an anonymous internet person is a series of coded messages from a secret government insider.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question fascinates me because it’s clearly someone very creative and knowledgable. Not necessarily “insider” knowledge but as in very aware of how to manipulate info into a consistent and intriguing narrative. It could be just a crafty troll having a good time, but given how sustained the effort is,  I think it being some sort of psyop by an intelligence organization is more likely. But which organization that would be, and under what flag, I don’t have a clue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no. its a group of people from /pol irginally on 4ch, then banned from it, then 8ch, then banned from /pol until they opened their own board where they ban anyone calling them out. then kicked from reddit when CBTS was shut down,then opened yet another board the ridiculous GA.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>So, it only works on redditors b/c they are the laughing stock of the board world, gullible, useless for research and major sufferers of groupthink.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>q foolery continues because they monetized it. a psyop is well funded, they dont need the income. look up the owner of q anon. look into his background. Look at the person who rented the q billboards. trace the q t shirt companies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it originated on /pol/. That doesn&#39;t solve the issue of who is behind it though. Anyone with any familiarity about the internet knows 4chan would be the perfect place to start if you wanna disseminate weird bullshit, cuz 4chan is already conspiracy-minded and eats up anything that makes them feel special, like they&#39;re the only ones in on a big secret.</p>

<p>Qanon is not limited to reddit so idk what you mean. Reddit is just another platform for all sorts of discussion so of course a movement of any sort would likely have a large presence here. As far as &quot;laughing stock of the board world&quot; no offense but sounds like something your typical iamverysmart gatekeeping 4chan user would say. As if the rest of the internet is a bastion of intellect. It makes even less sense because 4chan were the first ones to fall for this shit and spread it around. </p>

<p>Besides, it spread far beyond either of those realms at this point. If you&#39;ve seen any of the news segments where reporters went to talk to a bunch of clueless middle-aged nutters holding up qanon signs and wearing qanon t-shirts, they barely know what 4chan or reddit is at all. </p>

<p>And how that happened brings me to my next point - expanding advertisement is not necessarily indicative of profit motive. If your goal is to spread an idea to as many people as possible, of course it makes sense to have billboards and stupid t-shirts - easy access for the above-mentioned demographic of people to get involved.</p>

<p>This is the result - of course CNN probably cherrypicked the most clueless people to show but they probably didn&#39;t need to put in much work to find them lol. 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dGVXmuLmEM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dGVXmuLmEM</a></p>

<p>Half these people can&#39;t even articulate what q anon is. Mass advertisement allows the idea to rapidly gain followers who don&#39;t have a lot of brain cells to spare and will join it as an extension of their political cult membership and not have to look into it themselves.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s also possible that none of this is even relevant, because anyone could be selling those t-shirts. It&#39;s not like qanon is copyrighted. It&#39;s open for any business-minded person to pounce on the opportunity to profit from its popularity. </p>

Wake up.
Notice there are no more twiiter call outs fro mQ? Thats because the guys who run operation Q were able to use a hack to intercept tweets. That hole is now closed. Since I&#39;m part of that community, I know what happened. SO you explain me - why no more tweet syncs?
The reason is what I said - it was an exploited hack, which twitter closed. THat invalidates q, but if you dont believe that, check up on how trump filled the swamp, and not drained it. Look at background of everyone in his cabinet from day 1. Start with Mercer, Bannon, and especially Mnnuchin</p>

Its a group of Americans that want to see this country taken back from the intelligence agencies that hijacked it many years ago when they killed JFK. We want to stop seeing our family and friends being sent to pointless wars to push an agenda that doesn&#39;t benefit us. We want to restore faith in our justice system and stop watching bankers and politicians walk free for the same charges we would face prison for. We want our taxpayer money to go towards America&#39;s problems first instead of shipping pallets of cash to foreign countries. We&#39;re a group that takes the time to research and have known a lot of this information before Q even came along.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s likely black cube, or some other Russian Israeli company that is working with the Trump administration since 2015. They began their attack on JCPOA in 2014 and after Republicans backed away from these groups, they enlisted Netanyahus close allies kushner and Trump. They made a regional deal with Russia Israel Saudi UAE turkey and got trump in. Trump then gave Jerusalem to Israel along with 64 billion dollars. They helped Salman carry out a coup in Saudi likely causing the Vegas massacre. They failed on their obligations to turkey as we are seeing the backlash. UAE got some islands and an upgraded trading ranking the wbo and the banking cartel. And of course we see Russias payout with their oligarchs having eased access to America by being able to launder sanctioned money through Israel into America. Before trump is out, we will see Israel annex parts of the west bank which kushner has claims and investments. We will see Russia grab and control Iran&#39;s oil in conjunction with Israeli American oil tycoons. We will likely see a collapse and rebuilding of the UN.</p>

<p>Q anon is a Propaganda drive by this group to get the base to support this as the old guard and their control of media and congress are mad about it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q is real, but not what its followers think.  I spent a career in military intelligence.  This Q phenomenon is a very well executed psyop directed AT those Trump supporters who should be revolting because he hasn’t locked her up or built a wall.  Q is keeping those supporters pacified with the farce that a massive counter-coups is being fought in the shadows.     I often remark that Q is fan fiction meets psychological operation.﻿ </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q fakery is a group of larpers - Pamphlet anon,  CodeMonkey, AJ/Corsi, and some others were involved early. Then the group got greedy and started in-fighting. Thus the garbage about trips being reset, compromised, etc. Notice how there are no more (fake) tweet collusions? Twit covered the backdoor that allowed someone to intercept tweets before they were published. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Best thing: never look at q again, and run from anyone supporting q. JA even called Q out, and he was fairly independent (vs Snowden who is CIA asset).</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>For the desperate qcumbers: Trump works for israel/zionists. Rothschild literally bailed out Mogul out, and he went directly into partnership with Roths and Rocks through aquiring stake in RI, back in I think &#39;79 or &#39;81 or therebouts.  So, the q group promoted Mogul, who is supported by Roths - who q claims runs deep state.</p>

<p>Trump is deep state.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>More? Mogul filled the swamp - check his best boy Mnuchi&#39;s creds and history (skull and bones alum, worked for Roths for years, more).</p>

<p>Bannon? Pawn of Mercer. Reb Mercer on Mogul cabinet.</p>

<p>Who is Mercer? Do your homework.  Mercer was DJT biggest backer pre election. Appears linked through long history to Roths, though dubiously. What is not unknown is the owl at bohemian grove, the owl at epstein island, and other silly q references to owls - but then what? Mercer main residence is called by RM &quot;the Owls Nest&quot; and his yachts are all named &quot;the sea owl&quot;.</p>

<p>qcumbers have a phrase about &#39;symbols be there downfall&#39; and the owl is a symbol of child sacrifice and pedos. Correct - anyone with a brain figured out that symbols are the downfall of the q fakery. If owl is most high eveil, and Merer uses owl effigy, and Mercer backed DJT and a Merer is on DJT cabinet, then...yes, Trump is with Owl symbology and evil.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>How many number were there for DJT in Epstein black book? More than 12+ differnet numbers.</p>

<p>HOw many visits by Mogul to Epstein island?</p>

<p>Look it up - many.</p>

<p>Just another mistake made by the ever shrinking group faking the q garbage.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>q fool on McCain: &quot;Brain surgery fake, and will use cancer as excuse to not answer court questions when arrested&quot;</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Reality: McCain actually died of brain cancer, and nobody but nobody has ever been arraigned, arrested, implicated officially in anything q said.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Reality: DJT&#39;s people are found guilty of major crime, his own lawyer implicates him and is investigated - so, the exact opposite of q foolery.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>
