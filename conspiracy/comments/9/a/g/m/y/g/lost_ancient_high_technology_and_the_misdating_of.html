        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Throughout the Giza plateau there are several structures which would be impossible without high technological innovation. This includes the sphinx (which it is finally becoming mainstream that it is 10-13k years old), the pyramids(which the mainstream has recently admitted can be used to focus electromagnetic energy at the base, this cannot be accidental as there was never any mummies found in the pyramids). Generally the level of construction and accuracy exceeds our own, the  blocks of stone as I&#39;m sure you all know are fitted to each other.  There are drill holes which drill through basalt at a drill rate that we cannot match with current technology.  We are being lied to about past cycles of humanity. </p>

<p>Why do you think they do not want us to know that we are living in a society that was built on the ashes of another? Why does our government want to believe we are the first? What benefit does this provide?</p>

<p>Why is there no orbital debris left behind from their space programs and satellites? </p>

<p>The problem with ancient civlizations being as advanced (or more) as us is there’s no evidence where there should be. Humans are messy, any civilization with our technology level has a big impact on the earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting! The idea that a more advanced species used us for soave labor is one I’ve heard before (SG-1 anybody?!).</p>

<p>That said, we’re certainly smarter/more advanced than then. Why havent they wiped us out again?</p>

<p>Also, I feel like aliens would use anti-matter bombs. Much more powerful, and cleaner.</p>

<p>While all of this is interesting, I admit there’s little evidence. I strongly believe there is other life in the universe. I’m not certain it’s ever been here, but there is a chance. The UFO phenominon has been supported by so many people over the years, I can’t completely say it’s not real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting concept, but an infared star would be extremely bright, no?</p>

<p>Even home camcorders could see it, and night vision goggles which are fairly common.</p>

<p>The only way you wouldnt see it is if it was perfectly orbiting the sun on the opposite side. But even then, other planets in different positions would be far too bright as they woild reflect the IR. Even amauture astronomers would quickly detect this. </p>

<p>Interestingly, a gravitational anaylsis <em>did</em> predict a large jupiter-size gas giant out past pluto that we havent been able to find yet. That could be your target, but if it exists it’s very dark and super cold. Also, gas giants are pretty crappy places to live in general. If life did exist there it would be highly exotic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glass can take up to a million years to decompose, and that’s not even relevant since it could last longer in proper conditions.</p>

<p>If there was an advanced civilization with billions of people, high tech stuff like computers and soacecraft etc etc there would be evidence. Ice layers in the artic would contain layers of contaminants from industrial waste... but they don’t. </p>

<p>maybe if you had some kind of cataclysm that turned the entire earth’s surface into magma and boiled the atmosphere... sure. </p>

<p>But then life would have to re-evolve so we’d be talking billions of years and whatever came before wouldnt be human anyways.</p>

<p>It’s a fun thought, but there’s zero evidence for it and a lot of missing evidence that should be there.</p>

I made these claims because regardless of what you say about how they constructed it a lot of the materials you are mentioning were found by the dynastic Egyptians and repurposed not built originally, it is simply too great of a feat with Bronze Age tooling. </p>

<p>The evidence is continually mounting that there was a culture that predates the dynastic Egyptians for a reference look at the sphinx it is at least 10-12k years old based upon the water erosion around the enclosure.</p>

<p>By the transitive property if the sphinx is older than we though it is it is very possible other things are as well. </p>

<p>I am not here to debate the minutiae of the tools that doesn&#39;t excite my excitement is from the idea that humanity had a higher culture that isn&#39;t covered in our textbooks which generally start in the Fertile Crescent 3500BC</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the fallacy from personal incredulity. Do the math on how many work hours it took and calculate the workers required before you make that determination.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>sphinx it is at least 10-12k years old based upon the water erosion around the enclosure</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Take a close look at the water erosion hypothesis and you will find that there is no concrete methodology presented, no falsifiability and no data behind it.</p>

<p>Just a few people claiming: It look older to us, therefore it is older.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the transitive property if the sphinx is older than we though it is it is very possible other things are as well. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unlike the Sphinx we can radiocarbon date the pyramids (wood, grasses, charcoal in the mortar). </p>

<p>Hundreds of samples from the pyramids were taken from top to bottom, inside to outside and the results were in the 2.5k-3k BCE range.</p>

<p>Now if you want to choose fiction over science because it&#39;s more exciting that&#39;s up to you.</p>

1. Science starts with observations
The observation that the sphinx is older was made with the methodology of the sphinx creation in mind and geological erosion can be validated

<p>You can&#39;t just look at the Sphinx and conclude an age because you don&#39;t know the erosion rate from looking. </p>

<p>Now, the disagreement is based on what erosion rate had which impact at what time. Finding conclusive evidence either way is very difficult.</p>

<p>The pyramids used lots of mortar. Small amounts on the casing and backing stones, but lots on the core stones that aren&#39;t dressed.</p>

<p>Additionally Jobs first family was sent to their next life for practically no reason, even if we can assume Job actually was being tested or otherwise prepared to move ahead in his journey to whatever end, his family likely wasn&#39;t at the same stage and could not have possibly have been required to die like that.</p>

<p>The pyramids are stone. Stones are not conductive, and theh cannot generate or transfer electricity. It makes ZERO sense if you look into it.m</p>

<p>I suspect you’re not researching, but ingesting false information. It’s rock. You can’t use rock to generate or send energy. If the pyramids were metal you could have something worth investigating.</p>
