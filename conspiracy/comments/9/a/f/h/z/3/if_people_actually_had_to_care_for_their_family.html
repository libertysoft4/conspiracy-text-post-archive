<p>Giving people welfare means that their families don&#39;t need to provide for them or even care for them, they can become isolated.</p>

<p>We see this in every aspect of society. Governments educate kids, parents don&#39;t. We force kids to sleep alone for cultural reasons, and psychologists will support this (which lessens emotional closeness and increases mental illness). Wives divorce knowing government will provide for them. Parents fail to raise their kids because they know government will be there to help, etc...</p>

<p>If people needed each other our relationships would be too strong for us to be exploited so easily.</p>

<p>The whole setup of society is designed to divide people. Even our living situation. People often have conflicting beliefs with, or don&#39;t even know their own neighbors.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all to divide us, including welfare. They don&#39;t want us to be strong and support each other. We are weaker divided and become more reliant on the government which is what they want.</p>

<p>I never said it had an impact on minimum wage jobs. They&#39;re already minimum wage, they cant any lower.. Those are entry level job that should be for kids. Illegals have a huge impact on labor jobs though. Construction, plumbing, painting, carpet installer, etc have all been driven way down by illegals immigration. Hard for American laborers to compete with illegals who will work less and usually get paid under the table.</p>

<p>Healthcare emergencies are the number one cause of bankruptcy. </p>

<p>But health can affect where someone works even before they&#39;re bankrupted by large medical care costs. There are a lot of people who work minimum wage jobs not by choice, but because that&#39;s the only job their health allows them to work at the time. Should they starve?</p>

<p>No, liberals don&#39;t defend illegal immigration, did you already forget how often you cited how many illegals Obama deported?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is one of the most well known liberal talking points. The problem is he is also the president that let the most illegals in the country. The #&#39;s he deported are peanuts compared to the #&#39;s of illegals he let in. Heres an interesting tidbit about how deportations were so inflated under the obama administration: During a House Appropriations Committee hearing, Rep. John Culberson (R-Texas) said to Johnson, &quot;Under the Obama administration, more than half of those removals that were attributed to ICE are actually a result of Border Patrol arrests that wouldn&#39;t have been counted in prior administrations.&quot;</p>

<p>Johnson responded, &quot;Correct.&quot;</p>

<p>Jessica Vaughan, the Director of Policy Studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, has been arguing that actual deportations have declined under Pres. Obama. In her research, she says that if you <a href="http://cis.org/OpedsandArticles/Obama-Record-Deportations">count all removals</a>, including those done by ICE and Border Patrol, then the Obama administration averages 800,000 removals per year. In comparison, George W. Bush would have removed more than 1.3 million illegal aliens per year, and Bill Clinton would have removed more than 1.5 million per year.</p>

<p>This is simply not true. If you&#39;re speaking of agricultural jobs (fruit/veggie picking) what you said may apply but thats a VERY SMALL % of overall jobs(under 3%). Construction and many other labor jobs on the other hand are now dominated by illegals. Those wages have been driven way down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao, &quot;oppression of labor&quot;? Where do you people come up with this stuff? </p>

<p>Why are there so many people who think that someone making minimum wage should be able to afford a new iPhone every two years, own a house a city, have the best healthcare, take their families on multiple vacations a year, have two cars and a dog and eat at restaurants every other night. </p>

<p>Minimum wage IS enough to get by on. It isn&#39;t enough to have everything, this will never change and attempting to force it artificially with government regulation is a disastrously stupid idea that will lead to business shutting down because the cost of operation exceeds profits. It&#39;s a nice idea, but what you types of people never seem to grasp is that money isn&#39;t &quot;invented&quot;. I suggest you take a course in business or 
economics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blaming welfare makes no sense. If social programs were legit, non-cronyist and properly funded by fair taxation (everyone pays their fair proportional share via tax brackets, no tax dodging loopholes for billionaires/corporations), money removed from politics, CIA/secret societies purged from gov and the FED nationalized, the elites&#39; power would be insanely reduced and there would be more power to the workers.</p>

<p>Pretty sure families still look after their kids regardless of social programs. But there&#39;s less time to spend with your kids if your job pays a shitty wage for long hours (some even have two or more jobs wtf man). </p>

<p>I&#39;m not against homeschooling but public education is also a good thing, if not compromised by conflicts of interest/agendas. I don&#39;t want to go back to the era when only the very rich could afford an education, although the current education system is broken just like the justice system. Money in politics is obstacle number 1 imo.</p>

<p>When we pool our resources together for efficient social programs in a fair way, to give everyone an equal opportunity to better their lives, that IS relying on each other, and not the elites/or the &quot;every man for himself&quot; extreme-individualist Darwinistic bullshit. The elites KNOW uniting helps each other, they unite with themselves and try to divide the people. We need a balance of collectivism and individualism (not to be confused with &quot;individual-ity&quot; which is something else). Do things for the greater good without hurting individuals.</p>

<p>We are weaker if we don&#39;t have social programs, it just becomes the strongest/most corrupt survive and the rest struggle (due to compromised social programs, this is already the case to some extent). </p>

<p>As for the divorce thing....that is a separate issue, it does not deserve a blanket blame of &quot;welfare&#39;s fault&quot;. It could be a deliberate thing or it could be a &quot;some don&#39;t realize some women are sociopaths too who take unethical advantage of marriage laws&quot; cultural thing.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t fall for the trojan horse of &quot;zero gov/social programs/taxation is freedom&quot; bullshit. It needs to be fixed, not removed. It&#39;s like firing all police officers.....some are crooked but firing them all is still a trap the psychopath criminals would love for us to take.</p>

But as long as we start to improve things as we go, it&#39;s not too bad.

I can run to the store for my mom if she needs it. Help carry groceries in. Take the garbage out for them. Do al sorts of things to help out. Meanwhile this world gives me shit and tells me constantly that I’m not a real person unless I move out and become independent on my own and get my own house my own car my own everything. Meanwhile half these people miss their families and hardly ever see him And would kill for a time just to see him at Christmas. Why does the world want to shit on people for just wanting to be with their families rather than flee the coop? Some people were forced to at an early age from their parents and I’m sorry to hear that. But that’s because your parents probably wanted to teach you how to be independent or they just didn’t want you around. But just because that was your reality doesn’t mean everyone else should have to leave the house at 18 or whatever age you deem fit. It’s interesting to see the world skew what their perception of normal should be more and more every year. It becomes clear that they’re just trying to create independent customers.</p>

<p>The real issue is that people in cities do not trust their neighbors and are encouraged to think of them as dangerous strangers.  In the city, we mom and my family did not get help.  Instead we got picked on by the city.  When I got older and moved to the countryside, people help their neighbors.  They look out for each other.  They participate in their local community and local government.  Everyone here knows everyone else.</p>

<p>There are so many of us trapped in huge cities with faceless, nameless anonynomity.  The concept of neighborhoods and community has disintegrated.  Leave the concrete jungle sometime and you will see community and family still exists.  Welfare is not the problem, it is the apathy and selfnishess that have become standard in the dog-eat-dog world of city life.</p>
