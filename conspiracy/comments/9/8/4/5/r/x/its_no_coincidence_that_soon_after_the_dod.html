<p>Like realistically, why would aliens be hanging out here for the last 50 years trying to be all secretive (yet apparently flying around in the day time), but are somehow able to reach out to world leaders and only let them in on their secretive existence? Like who actually believes this crap?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a few different thoughts, and since we&#39;re actually discussing conspiracy topics for once in this sub, here&#39;s a few of my favorites, in order of likelihood:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aliens are fake, used to cover up some kind of rapid technological breakthrough that puts us hundreds of years ahead of where we should be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems to most logical and answers for pretty much all the evidence we&#39;ve seen. It&#39;s entirely possible the elite ruling class has the capability to end world hunger/poverty/need to work and turn us into a post-scarcity society in a day; but we&#39;re still just monkeys. We wouldn&#39;t trust it if the technology came out tomorrow that could save us from our ills and actually usher in an inevitable future age earlier than we as a society would be willing to accept it. People like you would be the targets holding back the release of this technology in this case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aliens exist, but want us to develop mostly on our own. They&#39;re here as guardians or other symbiotic entities. They only want compliance from people that have the power to disrupt their plans, whatever they may be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we make the assumption based on evidence provided that Aliens exist, this is the best case scenario that&#39;s still down-to-Earth (pardon the phrasing.) They wouldn&#39;t want or need to announce themselves to Joe Dirte in the middle of nowhere, because what the fuck is he going to do about it? They just need to not be shot down.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aliens exist, but are holding us hostage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The independence day theory with less explosions. If a super advanced race existed, but for whatever reason has found AI lacking, the human race being slaves makes perfect economic sense. In every human society that has ever existed, there has been the concept of slavery of some form. It&#39;s entirely possible (and consistent with theories I won&#39;t mention here thanks to the History Channel) that they need us as slave labor, so their race doesn&#39;t have to labor for whatever materials or goods they need.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The world exists as a prison, we are the prisoners, only through toil in life can we be eventually set free.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This assumes that Aliens are transdimensional, souls exist, and our souls are trapped in a rebirth cycle until we&#39;re cleansed of whatever defect we have so that we can be reborn into whatever other race exists. This explains every single religious encounter in history, and every single idea about religion in history except the next one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re in a prison or harvesting factory for souls, living our lives repeatedly until a certain time, at which time our souls are removed from the cycle for an unknown purpose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would be the Judeo-Christian loophole. The whole you don&#39;t get to heaven until Jesus comes back. Still a potentially endless cycle of despair waiting for someone to turn the off switch on the soul device.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aliens are us, that traveled back in time/to a different time line in order to guide development and prevent a terrible future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This assumes two things: Non-Paradoxical time travel is possible (either through Time Strands/Splits i.e. the time rope/time tree theory) and that we would know that the general public is too stupid to handle the knowledge (which is the most realistic part of anything stated so far in this comment.)</p>

<p>Now these are interesting theories, and there are dozens more that go from as mundane as the first theory, to actual schizophrenia vaguely involving the string theory. We know secret societies exist in plain sight but without clear purpose (Bilderberg et al.), a secret society based around visitors of any type could do the same. And again, if any of the above are true, why would they ever let you in on it? Who the fuck are you? What&#39;s to say you won&#39;t just do something stupid and animalistic for what would be an incredibly primitive reason like absolute individualism or some archaic self-defeating version of freedom?</p>

<p>Yes hes probably a secret genius taking the most roundabout way to do good things</p>

<p>Instead of, you know, just doing it. As the president of the United States with a super majority and stacked courts, I think he has the green light.</p>

<p>But yeah 4d chess. I guess thats not a joke to everybody yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sigh, why do people focus so much on Trump. Trump has a power structure behind him without he would have never made it which surely sets the main goals for his administration. </p>

<p>&quot;Just doing it&quot; very likely conflicts with how the government, criminal structures/intelligence <em>and</em> banks has been working for decades. Turning off money streams of one nature and creating new ones is no trivial thing. I&#39;m sure a lot of people who had their hands in the money stream would ruin havoc which might explain today&#39;s MSM reality.</p>

<p>Look how the NWO/UN has tried for 20 decades to create a CO2 tax to finance their global government structure based on a fraud of epic proportions. If they could have done this by &quot;just doing it&quot; they would have done so.</p>

<p>I am assuming that this new Space Force will also only be used to spend hundreds of billions to intensify the data collection and cover the enormously expensive task of analyzing the data so it can be used  to effectively control and eliminate any dissenting voice no matter how small the voice or how remote the dissenter&#39;s   location.</p>
