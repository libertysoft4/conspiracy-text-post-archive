        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is part two of who knows what number...... </p>

<p>I can go so deep into this stuff. </p>

<p>Hello again, I would like to follow up on some further findings from the report referenced in my <a href="https://redd.it/97fgsu">first post</a> from the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine on the topic of the dangers of fluoride in drinking water. </p>

<p>The last post specifically referenced the <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/11571/chapter/2">summary</a>, along with chapters 1, 2, and 7, and briefly touched over the effects on the endocrine system in <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/11571/chapter/10">chapter 8</a>. But I decided to go even further into that bible of a document and archived my annotations. <strong>I will specifically be discussing chapter five</strong>, about the skeletal effects of fluoride at current United States drinking water levels. My first post mainly dealt with neurological effects on the brain (along with dental, renal, gastrointestinal, and endocrine effects), and now I am going to share links toward possible correlations of drinking water in the United States, which is fluoridated in most areas, to skeletal problems, osteoporosis, and possibly even bone cancer. </p>

<h1>Findings</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/11571/chapter/6">This part explains itself, it is chapter four and it discusses dental fluorosis which I discussed in my last post</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/11571/chapter/7">Chapter 5</a> findings </p>

<p>Chemistry of fluoride in relation to tissue as <a href="http://archive.is/4ZGqX#selection-539.0-542.0">a description of fluoride in the body</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fluoride is the ionic form of the element fluorine. Greater than 99% of the fluoride in the body of mammals resides within bone, where it exists in two general forms. The first is a rapidly exchangeable form that associates with the surfaces of the hydroxyapatite crystals of the mineralized component of bone. Fluoride in this form may be readily available to move from a bone compartment to extracellular fluid. Bone resorption is not necessary for the release of fluoride in this form. However, the predominant form of fluoride in bone resides within the hydroxyapatite crystalline matrix.</p>

<p>Release of fluoride from bone when it is in the form of fluoroapatite requires osteoclastic bone resorption. Acidification of the mineral matrix by the osteoclast is sufficient to solubilize the fluoroapatite and allow free exchange with extracellular fluids. Once released, the effect of fluoride on bone cells may be evident; however, the form in which fluoride has its effect remains under debate. <strong>Some investigators contend that fluoride directly affects bone cells</strong>, but others claim that the effect must be mediated by fluoride while in a complex with <em>aluminum</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I briefly touched how aluminum in the body reacts with fluoride and how aluminum and fluoride content in the body may be linked to several cerebral effects in the brain and how it may be linked to Alzheimer&#39;s and Dementia as well. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do fluroaluminate complexes exist in biological fluids? The answer to this question depends in large part on pH, protein concentration, and cell composition. However, in general, in the acid environment of the stomach much of the aluminum and fluoride exist in a complex of AlF3 or AlF4−. These forms (mostly AlF3) have been purported to cross the intestine and enter cells (Powell and Thompson 1993). Once inside a bone cell the AlFx form appears to activate a specific protein tyrosine kinase through a G protein and evoke downstream signals. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Further evidence shows how fluoride reacts <a href="http://archive.is/4ZGqX#selection-903.0-1135.48">with bone</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The prolonged maintenance of fluoride in the bone requires that uptake of the element occurs at the same or greater rate than its clearance. This appears to be the case. </p>

<p>Turner et al. (1993) put forward a mathematical model that appears to fit the known pharmacokinetic data. This model assumes that fluoride influx into bone is a nonlinear function. This assumption is supported by pharmacokinetic data and is required for the model to accurately predict fluoride movements. Another reasonable assumption is that the bulk of fluoride that moves between the skeleton and the extracellular fluid is due to bone remodeling. That is, most of the fluoride is either influxing or effluxing as a result of cellular activity. The outcome of the Turner model predicts that (1) <strong>fluoride uptake is positively associated with the bone remodeling rate</strong> and (2) <strong>fluoride clearance from the skeleton takes at least four times longer than fluoride uptake</strong>. A key correlate to the first prediction is that the concentration of fluoride in bone does not decrease with reduced remodeling rates. Thus, it appears that fluoride enters the bone compartment easily, correlating with bone cell activity, but that it leaves the bone compartment slowly. The model assumes that efflux occurs by bone remodeling and that resorption is reduced at high concentrations of fluoride because of hydroxyapatite solubility. Hence, it is reasonable that 99% of the fluoride in humans resides in bone and the whole body half-life, once in bone, is approximately 20 years. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Twenty. Years. </p>

<p>Twenty. </p>

<p>Years. </p>

<p>That shit is in there.... </p>

<p>for twenty years. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The effects of fluoride on <a href="http://archive.is/4ZGqX#selection-1141.0-1141.115">bone quality</a> are evident but are less well characterized than its effects on bone cells.</p>

<p>.....It has been known for many years that fluoride exposure can change bone quality. Franke et al. (1975) published a study indicating that industrial fluoride exposure altered hydroxyapatite crystal size and shape. Although the measurements in their report were made with relatively crude x-ray diffraction analyses, they showed a shorter and more slender crystal in subjects who were aluminum workers and known to be exposed to high concentrations of fluoride. Other reports documenting the effects of fluoride on ultrasound velocities in bone, vertebral body strength, ash content, and stiffness have shown variable results (Lees and Hanson 1992; Antich et al. 1993; Richards et al. 1994; Zerwekh et al. 1997a; Søgaard et al. 1994, 1995, 1997); however, the general conclusion is that, although there <strong>may be an increase in skeletal density</strong>, there is no consistent increase in bone strength. A carefully performed comparison study between the effects of fluoride (2 mg/kg/day) and alendronate in minipigs likely points to the true effect: “in bone with higher volume, there was less strength per unit volume, that is, … there was a deterioration in bone quality” (Lafage et al. 1995). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bone density and quality are very touchy subjects but they are conclusive toward linking fluoride content with skeletal problems, specifically higher densities and changes in strength. </p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/4ZGqX#selection-1161.0-1161.35">Effect of fluoride on cell function</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two key cell types are responsible for bone formation and bone resorption, the <em>osteoblast</em> and <em>osteoclast</em>, respectively. Osteoprogenitor cells give rise to osteoblasts. Osteoprogenitor cells are a self-renewing population of cells that are committed to the osteoblast lineage. They originate from mesenchymal stem cells. Osteoblasts contain a single nucleus, line bone surfaces, possess active secretory machinery for matrix proteins, and produce very large amounts of type I collagen. Because they also produce and respond to factors that control bone formation as well as bone resorption, they play a critical role in the regulating skeletal mass. Osteoclasts are giant, multinucleated phagocytic cells that have the capability to erode mineralized bone matrix. They are derived from cells in the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Their characteristic ultrastructural features allow them to resorb bone efficiently by creating an extracellular lysosome where proteolytic enzymes, reactive oxygen species, and large numbers of protons are secreted. Osteoclastogenesis is controlled by local as well as systemic regulators. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Osteoblasts: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the single clearest effect of fluoride on the skeleton is its stimulation of osteoblast proliferation. The effect on osteoblasts was surmised from clinical trials in the early 1980s documenting an increase in vertebral bone mineral density that could not be ascribed to any effect of fluoride on bone resorption. Biopsy specimens confirmed the effect of fluoride on increasing osteoblast number in humans (Briancon and Meunier 1981; Harrison et al. 1981). Because fluoride stimulates osteoblast proliferation, there is a theoretical risk that it might induce a malignant change in the expanding cell population. This has raised concerns that fluoride exposure might be an independent risk factor for new osteosarcomas (see <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/11571/chapter/12">Chapter 10</a> for the committee’s assessment).</p>

<p>The demonstration of an effect of fluoride on osteoblast growth in vitro was first reported in 1983 in avian osteoblasts (Farley et al. 1983). This study showed that fluoride stimulated osteoblast proliferation in a biphasic fashion with the optimal mitogenic concentration being 10 µM. The finding that fluoride displayed a biphasic pattern of stimulation (achieving a maximal effect at a specific concentration and declining from there) suggests that multiple pathways might be activated. <strong>It is possible that low, subtoxic doses do stimulate proliferation</strong>, but at higher doses other pathways responsible for decreasing proliferation or increasing apoptosis might become activated. This thinking suggested that fluoride might have multiple effects on osteoblasts and that might be the reason for some paradoxical findings in the clinical literature (see below). <strong>Nevertheless, the characteristics of the fluoride effect point clearly to a direct skeletal effect</strong>. Some of these characteristics are as follows: (1) the effects of fluoride on osteoblasts occur at low concentrations in vivo and in vitro (Lau and Baylink 1998); (2) fluoride effects are, for the most part, skeletal specific (Farley et al. 1983; Wergedal et al. 1988); (3) fluoride effects may require the presence of a bone-active growth factor (such as insulin-like-growth factor I or transforming growth factor β) for its action (Farley et al. 1988; Reed et al. 1993); and (4) fluoride affects predominantly osteoprogenitor cells as opposed to mature functioning osteoblasts (Bellows et al. 1990; Kassem et al. 1994).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then this: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The effects of fluoride on osteoblast number and activity in in vivo studies and clinical trials essentially parallel the in vitro findings. Most reports document increased osteoblast number; however, some investigators have documented a complex and paradoxical effect of fluoride in patients with skeletal fluorisis.... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Experimentation: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Boivin et al. (1989, 1990) reported that, in biopsy bone cores taken from 29 patients with skeletal fluorosis of various etiologies (0.79% ± 0.36% or 7,900 ± 3,600 milligrams per kilogram [mg/kg] of bone ash), there is an apparent increase in the production of osteoblasts with a concomitant increase in a toxic effect of fluoride at the cell level. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>TL;DR: Rising rates of fluoride at cell levels lead to an increase in production of osteoblasts; this is directly linked to proliferation in the cells, and could possibly involve <em>bone cancer</em>, which is further described in Chapter 10. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They provided data to indicate that chronic exposure to fluoride in both endemic and industrially exposed subjects led to an increase in bone volume, an increase in cortical width, and an increase in porosity. However, there was no reduction in cortical bone mass. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was an increase in <em>volume</em>, but not mass. </p>

<p>And now onto osteoclasts: </p>

<p>The Academy kicks it off with a <a href="http://archive.is/4ZGqX#selection-2177.0-2177.148">disclaimer</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The effects of fluoride on osteoclast activity, and by extension the rate of bone resorption, are less well defined than its effects on osteoblasts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, disclaimers out of the way, let&#39;s get to the findings. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most reports in the literature studying the effect of fluoride on osteoclast function indicate an inhibition. In fact, the effect might be mediated through G-protein-coupled pathways as in the osteoblast. Moonga et al. (1993) showed that fluoride, in the form of AlF4− resulted in a marked concentration-dependent inhibition of bone resorption.  </p>

<p>In association with this inhibition, they found a marked increase in the secretion of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). TRAP presumably originated from the osteoclast; however, its function as a secreted enzyme is not known. The fluoride effect was reproduced with cholera toxin, another Gs stimulator. This effect does not appear to be mediated solely by an AlFx complex because studies using NaF have reported similar findings (Taylor et al. 1989, 1990; Okuda et al. 1990).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cholera toxin&#39;s effect on cells, a Gs simulator, literally had the same effect as fluoride. </p>

<h3>Skeletal metabolism, and how fluoride is linked with osteoporosis</h3>

<p>Remember all of that complicated stuff in the last paragraph about osteoclastic bone resorption? How when fluoride leaves the bones it has to be absorbed by those cells? <strong>Guess what</strong>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the only therapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Admnistration for treating <strong>osteoporosis</strong> in the United States targeted only osteoclastic bone resorption.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, treating the very medicines that is caused by fluoride drinking water&#39;s <em>clearly shown</em> effects on bone porosity <strong>is literally the same treatment for treating osteoporosis</strong>. This clearly shows a linkage between osteoporosis and fluoride. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, fluoride did not prove to be an effective treatment for two major reasons. First, although it showed robust stimulation of bone mineral density (see below), its effects as an agent to reduce fractures have never been unequivocally documented. Second, because this naturally occurring element cannot be protected with a patent, the pharmaceutical industry has not been interested in investigating all its potential.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Effects of fluoride overall:</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>The first clinical trials of fluoride in humans were performed by Rich and Ensinck (1961). Since then many hundreds of reports have appeared in the medical literature. The overwhelming weight of evidence in these reports documents the effect of fluoride, at therapeutic doses, to be that of an increase in bone mineral density.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So ever since 1961, they&#39;ve been testing fluoride on people and found <em>overwhelmingly</em> solid evidence that fluoride is responsible for increases in bone mineral density. This is linked to <em>porosity</em>, which then is linked to osteoporosis. </p>

<p>Tl;dr: Your loved ones may be getting osteoporosis from drinking the water in the USA. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The lowest dose of NaF to show a clear increase in bone mineral density was 30 mg/day </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seriously. That&#39;s how strong this thing is. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whereas the daily dose of fluoride in randomized therapeutic trials (20 to 34 mg/day) exceeds that for people drinking water with fluoride at 4 mg/L (4 to 8 mg/ day for 1 to 2 L/day), <strong>the latter may be exposed much longer, leading to comparable or higher cumulative doses and bone fluoride concentrations</strong>. (8 oz in water). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The conditions for an estimate of the fluoride concentration as a function of distance from the osteoclast are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The bone being resorbed has a fluoride content of 3,000 mg per kg of bone ash.</p></li>
<li><p>Bone ash is assumed to include 65% of the volume of viable bone and the density of viable bone is 1.2 g/cm3. Thus, the concentration of fluoride in the bone compartment is
approximately 5,500 µg/cm3.</p></li>
<li><p>An osteoclast resorbs bone at an average rate of about 30,000 µm3 in 2.5 weeks.</p></li>
<li><p>The osteoclast is delivering fluoride to the extracellular fluid space from a point source with a radius of 20 µm.</p></li>
<li><p>Diffusion occurs into a three-dimensional spherical space around the osteoclast.</p></li>
<li><p>The diffusion coefficient of fluoride in extracellular fluid is approximately 1.5 × 10−5 cm2/s. </p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Studies of <a href="http://archive.is/4ZGqX#selection-3901.0-3901.17">bone fractures in relation to fluoride in drinking water</a> (still in chapter 5):</h1>

<p>Note this: They even compared the data to osteoporosis, like I said before: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The committee reviewed epidemiologic data on the relationship between fluoride exposure and fractures from two sources: observational studies of exposure to fluoride in water and randomized clinical trials of the use of fluoride in treating osteoporosis. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66KVzfYTrwI">Yep</a>. </p>

<h2>TABLE 5-2 Observational Studies of Bone Fractures in Populations Exposed to Fluoride Near <em>4 mg/L in Drinking Water</em></h2>

<p><em>The table wasn&#39;t formatted correctly in the report for me to html it or even snag it from the archive, so I <a href="https://imgur.com/a/H4aQH3k">made an imgur album wit the tables snapshot</a></em>. </p>

<p>Note how in the fourth image there is a part which is adjusted for <strong>bone mineral density, the same thing that I discussed earlier</strong>. This proved crucial for Sowers&#39; study. </p>

<p>This motherfucker named <em>Sowers</em> followed up in 2005 with another study. He&#39;s going hard in the paint with this stuff: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The newest study by Sowers et al. (2005) investigated bone fracture in relation to fluoride concentration in drinking water. The authors measured serum fluoride, providing a potentially improved exposure assessment. In this cohort study, fractures were assessed prospectively for 4 years. Fractures were self-reported and then confirmed with medical records or x-ray copies, if available; lack of fractures was apparently not confirmed. Sowers et al. (2005) collected individual-based information on people from the same regions as the 1986 and 1991 studies. They collected serum fluoride concentrations and bone mineral density of the hip, radius, and spine. The number of subjects was considerably expanded (n = 1,300) from the earlier studies. Although there may be overlap in specific subjects, all the fracture events were recent. The authors reported risk ratios of fractures in the high fluoride area that were similar to those in the previous studies (risk ratio = 2.55, P = 0.07, even when adjusting for bone mineral density, which could function as an intervening variable between water ingestion and fracture outcome). </p>

<p>Serum fluoride concentration was higher in the community with fluoride at <strong>4 mg/L in drinking water</strong>. Bone and serum concentrations are related but the latter have more noise—potentially much more, depending on how samples were collected. Serum fluoride concentrations can vary within individuals, returning to baseline within hours of exposure. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note how they keep saying 4 mg/L. That&#39;s the amount that frequent water drinkers like me get, I discussed the levels in my first post. </p>

<p>And then there was the Li study, after the Sowers study: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The study by Li et al. (2001) complements the Sowers studies in several ways, having a larger size and relatively strong exposure assessment for a partially ecologic study. It has a retrospective cohort design, increasing the potential for outcome and exposure misclassification, but these problems were addressed by the authors. Although exposure was assessed on the group level, exposure was finely categorized and other sources of fluoride exposure were estimated to be negligible. </p>

<p>....The Li et al. study did not directly assess fluoride at 4 mg/L. However the exposure group just above 4 mg/L (4.32 to 7.97 mg/L) <strong>showed an increase in all fractures</strong> since age 20 (OR = 1.47, P = 0.01, estimated 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.97), all fractures since age 50 (OR = 1.59, P = 0.02, estimated 95% CI = 1.08 to 2.35), and hip fractures since age 20 (OR = 3.26, P = 0.02, estimated 95% CI = 1.21 to 9.81). The exposure group just below 4 mg/L (2.62 to 3.56 mg/L) showed the following: all fractures since age 20 (OR = 1.18, P = 0.35, estimated 95% CI = 0.83 to 1.67), all fractures since age 50 (OR = 1.04, P = 0.87, estimated 95% CI = 0.65 to 1.66), and hip fractures since age 20 (OR = 1.73, P = 0.34, estimated 95% CI = 0.56 to 5.33). CI values were estimated by the committee using the approach of Greenland (1998). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And a double disclaimer: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although the authors did not estimate trend, Figures 2 and 3 presented in the paper by Li et al. (2001) suggest that linear trends in proportions from the 1.00 to 1.06 mg/L category up would provide a reasonable fit in that range. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Comparing both studies: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Estimated fluoride exposure in the Li study is higher than for the Sowers studies. Assuming that exposure was predominantly due to water, the committee estimated that participants in the Li study consumed on average about 2.5 L per day for the 2.62- to 3.56-mg/L group and 2.3 L per day for 4.32- to 7.97-mg/L group (versus 0.9 to 1.2 L per day for the Sowers studies). [These water consumption levels are in the 90th to 95th percentile for the United States](Assuming that exposure was predominantly due to water, the committee estimated that participants in the Li study consumed on average about 2.5 L per day for the 2.62- to 3.56-mg/L group and 2.3 L per day for 4.32- to 7.97-mg/L group (versus 0.9 to 1.2 L per day for the Sowers studies). These water consumption levels are in the <strong>90th to 95th percentile</strong> for the United States). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>See? The 90th to 95th percentiles are getting dangerous amounts of fluoride that shows clear musculoskeletal concerns as outlined by both the Sowers study and the Li et al study. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe me? <a href="https://i.imgur.com/4vVgbcg.png">Here&#39;s a table</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good collection: only thing to note is that all your studies used way more fluoride than should be in your water. Standard is 0.5mg per L; most of your studies would require me to drink my weight in water on a daily basis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are some groups of people who get much more fluoride. I also thought the typical dose in tap water was around 0.7 to 1 mg/L. </p>

<p>1 liter of green/black tea per day alone could provide almost the entire upper tolerable intake of fluoride (10 mg for adults), depending on which brand you buy, leading to an increased chance of developing dental and skeletal fluorosis when combined with other routes of fluoride exposure. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257422811_Human_exposure_assessment_of_fluoride_from_tea_Camellia_sinensis_L_A_UK_based_issue">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257422811_Human_exposure_assessment_of_fluoride_from_tea_Camellia_sinensis_L_A_UK_based_issue</a></p>

<p>This study found that fluoride free water, when infused with certain types of tea, can be as high as 8.8 mg/L, meaning that if you start with water fluoridated to 4 mg/L, legal in the US, this could rise to 12.8 mg/L. Realistically, most water is about 1 mg/L, but this shows that specific people could become vulnerable to skeletal fluorosis. </p>

<p>This is further complicated by the presence of fluoride in food. Few people know that fluoride is used as a pesticide in the US. Two examples are cryolite, used on grapes and other crops, and sulfuryl fluoride, which leaves a sodium fluoride residue on food. This obvious problem was realized by the EPA back in 2011, and they <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2011/01/11/11greenwire-epa-proposes-phaseout-of-fluoride-based-pestic-97414.html">proposed a phase-out of sulfuryl fluoride for this reason</a>, but never followed through. </p>

<p>Also think about processed food. A food plant might use fluoridated water to make food. </p>

<p>All of this stuff about fluoride isn&#39;t even the tip of the iceberg. You also have to think about lead, which is a serious problem across the United States. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>A USA Today investigation has identified &quot;almost 2,000 additional water systems spanning all 50 states where testing has shown excessive levels of lead contamination over the past four years, and at least 180 of the water systems failed to notify consumers about the high lead levels as federal rules require.&quot; <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/03/11/nearly-2000-water-systems-fail-lead-tests/81220466/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/03/11/nearly-2000-water-systems-fail-lead-tests/81220466/</a></p></li>
<li><p>&quot;US authorities distorting tests to downplay lead content of water.&quot; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/22/water-lead-content-tests-us-authorities-distorting-flint-crisis">https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/22/water-lead-content-tests-us-authorities-distorting-flint-crisis</a> </p></li>
<li><p>&quot;NYC fudged records to show day care centers’ water was tested for lead, but no tests were performed. DOHMH — the agency that&#39;s required to inspect all 11,000 child care centers in New York City annually — had more or less given up on the task.&quot; <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-faked-day-care-centers-lead-water-level-test-records-article-1.2686760">http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-faked-day-care-centers-lead-water-level-test-records-article-1.2686760</a></p></li>
<li><p>&quot;5,300 U.S. water systems are in violation of lead rules.&quot; <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/28/us/epa-lead-in-u-s-water-systems/">http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/28/us/epa-lead-in-u-s-water-systems/</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are also many other contaminants that are not tested for. We test fro a very small percentage of the potential contaminants, and many companies openly dump waste into rivers and lakes, which is where we get our water. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought it was 4 cups to the liter. Either way, my point is that specific people will receive much higher doses of fluoride, which will increase the number of people with dental and skeletal fluorosis due to the variety of sources of fluoride. Depending on who you are, 1 cup could push you over the limit. The fact that basically no government officials and probably even dentists mention all of these different sources strikes me as unbelievably incompetent. Do we want incompetent people telling us what is best for our teeth? </p>

English isn&#39;t my native language, but isn&#39;t this bullshit. Where do you get 4mg/l in drinking water? I can&#39;t find anything suggesting that from your first post either other than your own claims after this sentence:
Overall, the committee found that the contribution to total fluoride exposure from fluoride in drinking water in the average person, depending on age, is 57% to 90% at 2 mg/L and 72% to 94% at 4 mg/L.
It just says that if water fluoride level is 4mg/l it contributes 72% to  94% of total fluoride intake.</p>

<p>That is the EPA&#39;s limit on the amount of natural fluoride in water: eg. if you draw off a well, that&#39;s the limits. Any higher than that, they recommend you don&#39;t drink it at all.</p>

<p>But that level is already <em>very</em> high compared to civic water. Water treatment isn&#39;t to exceed 0.7mg/L.</p>

<p>Look, people who push the fluoride thing aren&#39;t great readers. They see the warnings and freak out because it is in their water.</p>

<p>They then forget it&#39;s in a lot of water, and these studies are mostly looking at industrial pollution, not natural or civic levels.</p>

<p>But it is possible OP has a water supply that is borderline and that is a bit disturbing. 4mg/L can happen, but that&#39;s an environmental problem, not a conspiracy to dope the population.</p>

<p>70% of the world lives on less than $10 USD per day. These are third world countries that don&#39;t have fluoridated water, because they don&#39;t have municipal water at all. They couldn&#39;t fluoridate if they wanted to.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Most of the Western world does it; the countries that don&#39;t tend to be the ones you usually class as not really having their shit together.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is simply not true, most of continental Europe does not fluoridate its water supply or allow for naturally fluoridated water, and I believe Ireland is the only country in the entire E.U. with a nationwide mandate for water fluoridation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mainland Europe tends to fluoridate their milk instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it does not, fluoridated milk is exceptionally rare. What is more common is fluoridated salt, however salt products containing fluoride are marked as such, and although some European countries do sell 70-80% of their salt with fluoride in it, you can usually always find places to buy salt without fluoride in it, much like how you can buy toothpaste without fluoride in it in the U.S. There is a stark difference between this and fluoridating a nation&#39;s water supply, as there is always a choice of what kind of salt you buy, whereas if the water supply has fluoride, you have no choice in the matter, your water is going to have fluoride in it, and then you have to invest a lot of money into getting water that does not have fluoride in it, either by buying such water from a private company, or by installing consumer filter products in your home such as reverse osmosis machines. The approach taken by many other western nations is fundamentally different from how the U.S. approaches fluoride and dental health. </p>

<p>List of countries that do not fluoridate their water supply that &quot;have their shit together&quot;. These countries also do not have substantial naturally occurring fluoride levels. Only Germany and Switzerland have high levels of fluoridated salt (over 50%), and only Spain, Ireland, and the U.K. have any substantial amount of water fluoridation (10% in the U.K. and Spain). Milk Fluoridation is so rare, I have only ever heard of the U.K. adopt it to any notable extent. It is also worth noting that the fluoride concentration levels set as maximum legal limits in these countries, is about double that of the U.S. despite the fact that their approach to water fluoridation is very different.</p>

<p>1] Belgium</p>

<p>2] Finland</p>

<p>3] France (they have fluoridated salt, which less than 1/3rd of the market consists of)</p>

<p>4] The Netherlands. They also actually don&#39;t add chlorine to their water, either. Strong move. I don&#39;t know if I agree with that, because chlorine can be filtered from drinking water very cheaply at home with inexpensive water filters, whereas fluoride is more difficult to filter out. That and, chlorine is added to the water to make it safe to drink, not to improve dental health.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no -- fluoride passes through to your urine, so know you aren&#39;t aggressively accumulating it, as would be the case for lead or heavy metals.</p>

<p>Your body can only hold so much water, which it uses to do whatever it does. The fluoride concentration of the water you&#39;re holding determines how much is incorporated into bones and teeth over time.</p>

<p>So, when you drink more water, your body rejects the excess: you piss it away. So, if you drink 10L of water at 0.5mg/L or 20L at 0.5mg/L, the amount of fluoride available to your body is the same: your body-water isn&#39;t concentrating the fluoride, it&#39;s a free ion, so it&#39;ll be pissed out too. The result is that no matter your water consumption, the actual amount available to your body is held fairly constant based on the average fluoride content of the water you consume.</p>

<p>Thus: if OP drinks 3L of water at 4mg/L, or 6L at 4mg/L, he won&#39;t be retaining more fluoride, since he&#39;s also losing water. </p>

<p>So what’s the the history of the western world all agreeing to put this in the water?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the late 19th century, doctors noted that diets low in fluoride resulted in increased rates of tooth decay -- there were discussions about how to properly supplement diets, but there were no clear ideas.</p>

<p>In the early 20th century, a series of communities reported significant dental staining. Investigators discovered the cause was high levels of fluoride in the local water table. Once an alternative water supply was substituted, the staining ended.</p>

<p>Continuing study of the fluoride content of water uncovered that areas with moderate fluoride content in the water reduced levels of tooth decay, and that areas with smaller amounts of fluoride had the tooth decay reduction without the staining.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Was there a lengthy discussion first?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quite. It took 50 years between the staining and civic water fluoridation programs began.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What years did each country start doing it? Or was it all at once?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most countries implemented fluoridation policies between the 1950s and the 1970s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Was there any backlash or push against it from the country’s people or opposing political parties?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty much since the beginning. Doctor Strangelove wasn&#39;t kidding: some small number of people thought fluoridation was a communist plot.</p>

<p>Otherwise, scientifically, most governments were sold.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it possible to realistically avoid fluoride?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it&#39;s in the water table in many areas, and in higher concentration than in civic water.</p>

<p>There is also pathology associated with deficiency.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are dentists and doctors unaware of the supposed downsides?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are completely aware: however, most people don&#39;t live in areas where fluoride poisoning is possible.</p>

<p>Dental fluorosis is commonplace and trivial; dentists know about it.</p>

<p>Skeletal fluorsis is incredibly rare, since environmental agencies test water supplies to prevent you from receiving that high a dose under normal circumstances.</p>

<p>Calcium fluoride is the insoluable mineral, which is found naturally -- it leeches fluoride into the water table as it breaks down.</p>

<p>Sodium fluoride is a water soluable salt.</p>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t use calcium fluoride in water treatment, since it won&#39;t dissolve quickly, and when it does the calcium will build up in your pipes.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter the source: nice thing about chemistry is that fluoride is the same element, no matter where it comes from.</p>

<p>Do I need to explain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility">dissolution</a> to you?</p>

<p>In brief, whether you get your fluoride from sodium fluoride added to civic water, or calcium fluoride from dissolved minerals in your water table, you aren&#39;t ingesting either sodium fluoride or calcium fluoride: you&#39;re ingesting fluoride ions in water. There is literally no difference by the time you drink it.</p>

<p>You certainly aren&#39;t ingesting calcium fluoride, because it&#39;s a solid. Unless your water has grains in it.</p>

<p>It was never disputed: the content of fluoridated water, however, is within the therapeutic range, and not the toxic range, which exceeds 4mg/L.</p>

<p>However, sodium fluoride is a salt, so it dissolves, so it&#39;s much easier to reach it isn&#39;t like eating rocks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The human body absorbs sodium fluoride very easily through ingestion and it is highly toxic.</p>

<p>Except you&#39;re not exposed to pure sodium fluoride in fluoridated water; you have trace amounts of fluoride ions and sodium ions in the water.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In case anyone was really serious about limiting their exposure to Fluoride, I would recommend not using fluoride toothpaste. Sure, fluoride in your drinking water is not good, but you get exposed to comparable amounts of Fluoride from toothpaste. Current recommendations for drinking water are 0.7-1.2 ppm (0.7-1.2mg/L) of fluoride. Normal Fluoride Toothpaste contains over 1000 ppm of fluoride. You&#39;re supposed to drink 2 liters of water daily, so that&#39;s 1.4-2.4mg of Fluoride a day at most based on that regulation, assuming your body absorbs all of it. But you&#39;re supposed to brush your teeth at least twice daily with about 0.25 mL of toothpaste each time. That&#39;s 0.6mg if you are only using a pea size and only brushing twice daily. If you brush 3 times a day and use the crazy, full bristle strip of toothpaste pictured in toothpaste commercials, you&#39;re getting up to 7mg of fluoride. That should give you an idea just how much fluoride you&#39;re likely putting in your body daily just from brushing your teeth with fluoride based toothpaste. It is probably just as much as what you are getting from drinking water, even though you aren&#39;t ingesting it. That fluoride can enter your body sublingually.</p>

<p>Also, for anyone interested in the conspiracy behind why Fluoride might be absolutely horrible for you, <a href="http://www.ourinterestingworld.com/conspiracies/fluoride-scam">here</a> is an article on the subject. Our old friend Edward Bernays (literally wrote the book on Propaganda. It was called &quot;Propaganda&quot;) ran the public relations campaign for The US Public Health Service&#39;s water fluoridation program under Oscar Ewing, the ALCOA lawyer turned Federal Security Agency Administrator. The modern equivalent is something like being the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of the Department of Education at the same time. ALCOA was one of the nation&#39;s largest manufacturers of aluminum, which sodium fluoride is a toxic byproduct of. In 1939, Fluoride was not in the water nor in toothpaste in considerable concentrations as a widespread, common convention. As the article linked states, water with more than 1ppm fluoride would be deemed unsuitable for drinking. Today, the recommended concentration has been lowered to 0.7ppm, so in some ways, our drinking quality standards have been improved, with the exception of the fundamental difference between regarding fluoride as a supplement to dental health products (as we view it today) and viewing it as a poison (as we viewed it in 1939). I think if we had the same sentiment that we had in &#39;39 in combination with the science of today, we&#39;d eradicate all trace of fluoride in consumer products. Your body has everything it needs to fight a lot of diseases, including gum disease, cavities etc. many diseases can be responded to by consuming adequate amounts of nutrients which allow the correct immuno-response to disease. In the case of dental health, brushing with a non-fluoride toothpaste and consuming the right amount of vitamin D and calcium can be as effective as using fluoride toothpaste. Just get your regular cleanings at the dentist, you&#39;ll be fine.</p>

Generally speaking, the more toothpaste you use when you brush your teeth, the higher % of toothpaste there is in this paste-saliva mixture. Idk how much of the fluoride is absorbed when you use a pea size amount of toothpaste, but I&#39;d gather it is significant.</p>

Basically what glycerin does to your teeth is costs them in a layer that no bacteria can penetrate- good or bad. The toothpaste also contains sodium benzoate which is a bit more of a controversial ingredient since when combined with ascorbpic acid(vitamin c) it can produce benzene which is a known cariongen</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole concept of osteoporosis has its roots in a philosophy money-driven not care-driven,(oh they&#39;d never do that!) that attempts to classify aging as a disease. Lowering bone density and increasing bone porosity are natural occurrences that accompany increasing age. The pharmaceutical companies would have you believe that this is bad, indeed, a disease. For which, of course, they have drugs you can purchase to take and combat the boogeyman they got us scared of in the first place. Nice scheme, huh? A little problem-reaction-solution in real life. Hegel would be so proud. Or at least admit the concept bears his name.(Hegelian Dialectic) But aren&#39;t lower bone density and increasing porosity bad? Well, there&#39;s an increasing body of scientific evidence that artificially high levels of bone mineral density are linked with increased levels of certain cancers. So what is the answer? I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m just putting out there what I learned for the next guy </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Preface: I&#39;m a junior doctor in a western country that provides healthcare to those who need it regardless of income. The American perspective on healthcare does not necessarily apply in full here. </p>

<p>It is absolutely both money driven (but not in the way you think) and care driven. Forget the label of disease lets look at problems. </p>

<p>Heres the problem facing the elderly. Decreased BMD leads to an increase in fractures, commonly wrist,hip/femur and vertebral. Following a hip fracture mortality for the individual affected is increased by (I think) about 50-60% for the year following. Many of these fractures are unavoidable but many are caused by decreased BMD. Vertebral fractures are a huge cause of chronic pain and lead to life long opioid dependence. </p>

<p>So clearly, decreasing these poor outcomes in a geriatric population is a care driven action. Modern treatment for osteoporosis decreases the likelihood of osteoporitic (decreased BMD) fractures. </p>

<p>On the Public Health side of things,  reducing hospital admissions for these fractures and indeed other age related conditions, reduces cost as a whole across the health services and reduces the strain on public surgical lists. This is the money driven part. </p>

<p>Big Pharma is not out to get you more than any other huge corporations. Which is to say they want to suck you dry for everything you&#39;re worth in the name of profit and progress. This is the state of the world today with the power that has been handed over to corporations by governments worldwide. </p>

<p>However, I&#39;ve yet to be convinced about the fluoride conspiracy, and I&#39;ve seen first had the reasons we should treat decreased BMD.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too had questions about increases in bone density resulting in weaker bones. It&#39;s counter-ntuitive. So I <a href="https://www.mdedge.com/ccjm/article/95089/endocrinology/bone-density-vs-bone-quality-whats-clinician-do">went looking for answers</a>. </p>

<p>Essentially bone density does not equate to stronger bones in the same way that well engineered bridges can hold more weight with less materials than poorly engineered bridges. Adding more materials to a shitty design is not going to give you a stronger bridge. And so, it&#39;s the same for bone. Take a 2x4 and lay it down on it&#39;s wide sides, now put weigh on the ends with a pivot in the middle. That 2x4 is going to break with less weight than if the same 2x4 was laid on its edge. </p>

<p>The take away is that fluoride may increase bone density as its ions are absorbed into the bone bringing in calcium and other minerals (I&#39;m completely making an educated guess here) with it, but not allowing those minerals to form strong lattices that would otherwise naturally occur. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to preface this by saying that I despise the fluoride in my water, and my household uses a distiller to drink almost exclusively deionized water. So I&#39;m with you, OP, as far as the anti-fluoride sentiment. Having said that, I do want to submit that people should look into their own water supplies to evaluate what you&#39;ve said. For example, my local city appears to have fluoride levels around 0.7 mg/L, making my daily exposure (if I drank the water without distilling) might be as high as 2.1 mg/day (drinking 3 L daily). This doesn&#39;t look like it would be a huge deal to me, although it does accumulate in the body over time. Am I missing something, or is that how the math works?</p>

<p>Thanks for your help on this, OP. Great work, and I look forward to going back to the first post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know r/conspiracy isn&#39;t big on <a href="https://health.gov/environment/Reviewoffluoride/concl.htm">studies and bonafide research</a>, but please consider this (READ THE WHOLE THING):</p>

<p>Extensive studies over the past 50 years have established that individuals whose drinking water is fluoridated show a reduction in dental caries. Although the comparative degree of measurable benefit has been reduced recently as other fluoride sources have become available in non-fluoridated areas, the benefits of water fluoridation are still clearly evident. Fewer caries are associated with fewer abscesses and extractions of teeth and with improved health. The health and economic benefits of water fluoridation accrue to individuals of all ages and socioeconomic groups, especially to poor children.</p>

<p>Since the addition of fluoride to drinking water in the 1940&#39;s, other sources of fluoride have become available, including toothpastes, mouth rinses, and fluoride dietary supplements. These sources of fluoride also have proven to be effective in preventing dental caries.</p>

<p>Estimates developed for this report show that fluoride exposure is generally greater in fluoridated areas; however, there is fluoride exposure in both fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas because of the variety of fluoride sources besides drinking water. Beverages and foods are sources of fluoride, especially if they have been prepared with fluoridated drinking water.</p>

<p>Optimal fluoridation of drinking water does not pose a detectable cancer risk to humans as evidenced by extensive human epidemiological data available to date, including the new studies prepared for this report. While the presence of fluoride in sources other than drinking water reduces the ability to discriminate between exposure in fluoridated as compared to non-fluoridated communizes, no trends in cancer risk, including the risk of osteosarcoma, were attributed to the introduction of fluoride into drinking water in these new studies. During two time periods, 1973-1980 and 1981-1987, there was an unexplained increase of osteosarcoma in males under age 20. The reason for this increase remains to be clarified, but an extensive analysis reveals that it is unrelated to the introduction and duration of fluoridation.</p>

<p>There are two methodologically acceptable studies of the carcinogenicity of fluoride in experimental animals. The Procter and Gamble study did not find any significant evidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice of either sex. In the NTP study there was no evidence of carcinogenicity in mice and in female rats. Male rats showed &quot;equivocal&quot; evidence of carcinogenicity based on the finding of a small number of osteosarcomas. &quot;Equivocal&quot; evidence is defined by NTP as &quot;...interpreted as showing a marginal increase in neoplasms that may be chemically related&quot; (HHS, 1990). Taken together, the data available at this time from these two animal studies fail to establish an association between fluoride and cancer.</p>

<p>By comparison with the 1940&#39;s, the total prevalence of dental fluorosis has increased in non-fluoridated areas and may have increased in optimally fluoridated areas. Such increases in dental fluorosis in a population signify that total fluoride exposures have increased and may be more than are necessary to prevent dental caries. For this reason, prudent public health practice dictates the reduction of unnecessary and inappropriate fluoride exposure.</p>

<p>In the 1940s, drinking water and food were the major sources of fluoride exposure. Since then, additional sources of fluoride have become available through the introduction of fluoride containing dental products. Although the use of these products is likely responsible for some of the declines in caries scores, the inappropriate use of these products has also likely contributed to the observed increases in the prevalence of very mild and mild forms of dental fluorosis.</p>

<p>Further epidemiological studies are required to determine whether or not an association exists between various levels of fluoride in drinking water and bone fractures.
Crippling skeletal fluorosis is not a public health problem in the United States, as evidenced by the reports of only five cases in 30 years. Crippling skeletal fluorosis, a chronic bone and joint disease associated with extended exposure to high levels of fluoride, has been more prevalent in some regions outside the United States.
Well-controlled studies have not demonstrated a beneficial effect of the use of high doses of fluoride in reducing osteoporosis and related bone fractures.</p>

<p>Genotoxicity studies of fluoride, which are highly dependent on the methods used, often show contradictory findings. The most consistent finding is that fluoride has not been shown to be mutagenic in standard tests in bacteria (Ames Test). In some studies with different methodologies, fluoride has been reported to induce mutations and chromosome aberrations in cultured rodent and human cells. The genotoxicity of fluoride in humans and animals is unresolved despite numerous studies.</p>

<p>Chronic low level fluoride exposure is nor associated with birth defects. Studies also fail to establish an association between fluoride and Down Syndrome.</p>

<p>There is no indication that chronic low level fluoride exposure of normal individuals presents a problem in other organ systems, such as the gastrointestinal, the genitourinary, and the respiratory systems. The effects of fluoride on the reproductive system merit further investigation in animal and human studies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I spent the first 3 years of my life in or around Florine county Illinois. I was born without a soft spot and my sagital suture closed early and I had to have it cut open at the age of 6 months. The government showed up in the area and demanded the water departments to add more florine to the water. My grandfather managed to fight them off. My uncle owned the Hardin county independent which serves florine county also. There is some evidence my aunt died of the same thing that affected me at the age of 6. In 1960 Union Carbide in Paducah Kentucky which is near florine county released 5000 and 7000 pounds of uranium hexafloride into the atmosphere and didn&#39;t tell any one so we could have taken iodine. On the plus side I don&#39;t get cavities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Citing an anti-fluoride lobbying group as evidence is an interesting strategy. Do you often fall for propaganda?</p>

<p>70% of the world lives on less than $10 USD per day. These are third world countries that don&#39;t have fluoridated water, because they don&#39;t have municipal water at all. They couldn&#39;t fluoridate if they wanted to.</p>

<p>Easy solution: get a water filter, or figure out that you need a lot more fluoride before it&#39;s a problem. None of the studies are hidden -- Hell, most are listed right here -- and you&#39;ll find that your civic water supply is well within the safe levels.</p>
