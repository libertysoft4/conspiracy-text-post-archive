        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="/r/MCAT">/r/MCAT</a> was recently banned, the only subreddit for those seeking help with their upcoming Medical College Admission Test. The MCAT is a 7 hour test required for students to get into Medical School. Potential doctors all around North America used this sub to discuss and talk about what could be the biggest test of their lives. It&#39;s gone now.</p>

<p>Why? </p>

<p>The MCAT is a test that costs hundreds of dollars and tens of thousands of students every year write and rewrite it. They&#39;re making a TON of money. A few billionaires decided they wanted a 7th private jet and decided to extract more money from poor students wanting to just help people with a fulfilling career as a doctor. How? By monetizing MCAT help. Meaning, you have to pay to get online resources that can help you study for the test. After this policy, they started to crack down on free help online. Reddit admins may have been paid off a few bucks to take <a href="/r/mcat">/r/mcat</a> down, forcing a bunch of kids to pay for the online help.</p>

<p>You make good points which unfortunately are not backed up with any kind of substance, just a lot of accusations.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with anything in your post, but without references, links, and substatative evidence, I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s all just more tilting at windmill rantings.</p>

<p>That’s my current theory. AAMC content screenshots have been posted on r/MCAT for nearly 3 years(hell even I remember posting a section bank screenshot way back when) and we <em>never</em> had any copyright complaints. </p>

<p>However according to Reddit legal there were <strong>37</strong> copyright complaints against r/MCAT in the past <em>3 months</em>. Guess what company has been getting more active/popular over the past 3ish months? Uworld. They have effectively shot themselves in the foot with this, all the “copyrighted” screenshots of their content basically constituted <em>free advertising</em> for their product, and now? If we ever get the original sub back? They will be swiftly blacklisted and any references to uworld will be filtered out using the automod. GG no re</p>

Need near perfect score in biology /physics/chemistry /biochem/organic chemistry /writing, and whatever other subjects they have added in the past few years, just to be accepted to an average med school. You either have your parents pay 2k for an MCAT prep course or self study, but you need access to prep books, practice tests, make monthly study plan and actually follow it. Although there are free sources out there:  MCAT question of the day, khanacademy, YouTube channnels, and SDN forums. </p>
