    <div class="md"><p>Depends on the country and the class of the people.  For example, a lot of the popular Japanese martial arts weapons -- Bo staffs, tonfa, Sais, Kama -- came into being because the lower classes were forbidden from owning swords.  Several of them were fashioned from farming tools. </p>

<p>The English longbow was such a prized weapon in the medeival period, and necessary to British defense, that for several hundred years, that all men were forced by law to own one and to train on them.  Training usually took place at the church, after services, on Sundays.  They went so far as to ban other sports and recreational activities so that the men had more time to focus on archery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thinking about people training with weapons in the past immediately makes me think of the steepe people, who were arguably the greatest bowmen, and horsemen, the world has ever (or will ever) see.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know of any historical weapon bans, though I&#39;m sure some feudal societies had weapon restrictions on peasant farmers. </p>

<p>Guns, especially of the more modern variety, really were a game changer in terms of giving a relatively unskilled individual significant killing power. Industrialization has also made weapons completely different, a sword in the past would require skill and be incredibly expensive to the point of being a prized family heirloom. Whereas now, damn near anyone can work a pistol and they&#39;re affordable to virtually anyone. </p>

<p>America is 5% of the world&#39;s population, yet owns 50% of all the guns in the world.  There&#39;s 89 guns for every 100 people in America and a quarter of the American population owns at least one gun.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, the UK puts restrictions on using knives right now, and they just put in jail for 4 months a man who had just bought a bow and was seen carrying it home..</p>

<p>Btw, the British might be touchy about the subject of simple weapons because the whole new human emancipation and Industrial Revolution had probably started there because of common ownership of bows (deadly weapon at the time) by their abused peasants class - and the &quot;elites&quot; obviously don&#39;t like such social changes and right know they are hedging themselves for the future just in case. </p>

<p>Also, the Chinese were once allowed to only posses one kitchen knife per village (yep, it was stored and used in one central place only) - probable side effect of this is that they came up with a truly fantastic construction of their &quot;Chinese cleaver&quot; which works great not only for preparing various kinds of meat and vegetables but also for felling (small) trees, preparing wood - and for self-defense purposes. If you could only have one knife then consider a Chinese cleaver.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would guess there were limits on weapons seen as primarily martial in nature, but many of these weren&#39;t practical to own anyway because of their cost of creation and limited utility.</p>

<p>But through a lot of history, armies weren&#39;t professional fighting forces armed by a central authority.  They were raised by local nobles who pressed the peasants into service and they were expected to bring their own weapons.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a blurry line between a military weapon and a tool for utility.  A short axe or hatchet was a battlefield staple for a long time, plus it has all kinds of other uses.  And none of that includes improvised weapons that combine the sharp bit of a tool meant for one thing combined with a different shaft or handle.  Put that knife on the end of a stick and it&#39;s now a spear.</p>

<p>My guess is that prohibitions on non-gun weapons ownership was mostly a later phenomenon when an area wasn&#39;t threatened by invasion and the local nobility wanted to keep a lid on insurrection and had the funds to pay for a full-time standing force to deal with whatever problems cropped up.</p>

<p>It was probably also more popular in urban areas partly as a means for keeping order.  The fewer fighting weapons the peasants had, the less likely they were to rebel OR get into tribal-type conflicts among themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Most if not all cultures tried to outlaw or ban their pesentry from owing weapons. Its harder to rape the shit out of your subjects if they are armed. Even with history as a clear and present guide there is that percentage of the population who enjoy the government dick up their ass. In prison there is the ideology that if you become a big man&#39;s bitch they will protect you. That percentage of the population suffer from such an ideology. Truth is however prison bitches rarely survive their sentence. If they do they are riddled with diseases, they are mentally and emotional unhinged and have to wear diapers for the rest of their lives. I draw direct parallels between prison bitches and those who feel the government will protect them and want the public disarmed. </p>
