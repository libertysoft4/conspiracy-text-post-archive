<p>In one study, cited by Psychology Today, 50 percent of gay men in San Francisco had over 500 sexual partners, compared to heterosexual men who had a lifetime average partner number of 15. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-imprinted-brain/201703/it-s-the-mode-men-have-more-sex-partners%3famp">www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-imprinted-brain/201703/it-s-the-mode-men-have-more-sex-partners%3famp</a></p>

<p>They are also much more likely to experience mental illness, depression, and suicide. Some have theorized homosexuality is actual a form of intense sexual obsession and fetishism, know as paraphilia. </p>

<p><a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1557988316685492">http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1557988316685492</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310132/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310132/</a></p>

<p>&quot;Although the incidence of heterosexual pedophiles exceeds that of homosexual pedophiles by a factor of about two to one, individuals in the population at large with a heterosexual orientation outnumber those with a homosexual orientation by about 20 to 1. Thus, although there are fewer homosexual than heterosexual pedophiles, the proportion of homosexual pedophiles is considerably higher than that of heterosexual pedophiles. Homosexual pedophiles also tend to be highly promiscuous. [In 1987], the mean number of victims of heterosexual pedophiles was 19.8, whereas among homosexual pedophiles the average number of victims was 150.2. Because they have more victims, homosexual pedophiles have a correspondingly greater likelihood of being apprehended, and this might account for their disproportionate representation among those arrested for sex crimes.</p>

<p>Furthemore, Gallup never claims that being seduced by a gay pedophile is the only path to homosexuality, nor that—obviously—&quot;turning gay&quot; is an inevitable outcome of being molested by an adult of the same sex. Instead, he argues, in the ancestral past, such developmental experiences would have led to statistically more homosexuality outcomes than would the absence of such encounters, and thus there was a selection bias for homophobia, apparently exacerbated by becoming a parent.</p>

<p>Recent evidence offers some support for Gallup’s model: men—but not women—who were sexually abused as children by same-sex adults are more likely than non-abused males to have homosexual relationships as grownups. Most researchers believe that there is something like a &quot;sexual imprinting&quot; process that occurs in early development, which may help to explain this, as well as fetishism and paraphilias. Note also that some of the most virulent homophobia today can be found on the playgrounds, which is consistent with the sexual imprinting model. Children and teen’s stubborn reluctance towards tolerating gays and lesbians may itself be an adaptive proscription orienting them away from same-sex experimentation. Gallup points to data showing that boys whose first masturbation experiences are around other boys are more likely to be homosexual as adults than are those who are alone. </p>

<p>&quot; A June 24 Metro article relates the fears of homosexuals who feel they are being unfairly linked to the pedophilia scandal in the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>In fact, the real scandal is that the press has failed to adequately investigate the link between homosexuality and child sexual abuse. The Family Research Council has just released a comprehensive report on the subject, which connects the dots. The report, titled &quot;Homosexuality and Child Sexual Abuse,&quot; brings to light some significant findings:</p>

<p>Pedophiles are invariably males: A report by the American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children states: &quot;In both clinical and non-clinical samples, the vast majority of offenders are male.&quot; The book &quot;Sexual Offending Against Children&quot; reports that only 12 of 3,000 incarcerated pedophiles in England were women. Significant numbers of victims are males: A study of 457 male sex offenders against children in Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy found that &quot;approximately one-third of these sexual offenders directed their sexual activity against males.&quot; Homosexuals make up less than 3 percent of the population, not &quot;8 to 10 percent&quot; as your article reported. A recent study in Demography estimates the number of exclusive male homosexuals in the general population at 2.5 percent and the number of exclusive lesbians at 1.4 percent. Homosexuals are overrepresented in child sex offenses: Individuals from the 1 percent to 3 percent of the population that is sexually attracted to the same sex are committing up to one-third of the sex crimes against children. A study in the Journal of Sex Research found that although heterosexuals outnumber homosexuals by a ratio of at least 20 to 1, homosexual pedophiles commit about one-third of the total number of child sex offenses.</p>

<p>The evidence shows a direct correlation between homosexuality and pedophilia. Your story should have included such evidence, because it affects not just the Catholic Church but all those concerned with shielding children from sexual abuse.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your point is true. But as a community, instead of playing the victim, shouldn&#39;t they be doing things to improve their situation? Instead of insisting that others solve their problems for them? </p>

<p>In no means is this an attack on the black community, this critique goes out to all groups of people. </p>

<p>On that note, why do we have to group ourself up and off from one another? Why can&#39;t we find common ground in all injustice, bond together and hold the true agitators accountable for their actions?</p>

<p>Do what exactly. Getting an education is expensive and community schools have a low budget because they live in a poor neighbourhood and people who can get a better education either through savings or a scholarship move out which in turn means that the area stays poor.   </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t help that socioeconomic movement is pretty bad in the US. Around half the people born into poverty stay poor. There&#39;s a limit how much you can do for yourself if the system requires you to have money to go forward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please, don&#39;t keep editing you posts after I reply. It is rude.</p>

<p>Except you are mixing you statistics.  The &quot;3-5 percent of men are homosexual&quot; is men who identify themselves as gay.  And men who abuse boys are often married and self identify as hetero.  Kind of like men who engage in gay activity in prison do not necessarily identify themselves as gay.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t say that.  Oh, that was one of the links you through in after.  Again, it doesn&#39;t specify gay, you&#39;re just making up stuff that isn&#39;t there.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Give me some statistics. Plus, many men are closeted homosexuals. And if gender really didn&#39;t matter to child abusers, then most child abusers would abuse both genders, which is not the case.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/18420556/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/18420556/</a></p>

<p>Only a small percent of pedophiles abuse both genders, and it is predominantly those who abuse the youngest children, as they have the least secondary sex characteristics.</p>

<p>Apparently you can&#39;t do math, so I&#39;m gonna help you out. </p>

<p>1/4 girls are sexually abused. That is 0.25. 1/6 boys are abused. That&#39;s 0.1666. Add then together and you get 0.4166. Divide 0.1666 by 0.4166 and what do you get....</p>

<p>0.40. 40 percent. So you&#39;re right, I was wrong. It&#39;s even higher than I thought.</p>

<p>I want to protect children at all costs, but when you divert resources away from important programs to focus on some bullshit link between homosexuality and paedophilia you&#39;re harming gay people by making false comparisons AND you&#39;re harming children by funneling money away from legitimate child advocacy programs.</p>

<p>A man molesting a little boy is not gay: he&#39;s a paedophile. Gay men are no more attracted to little boys than straight men are to little girls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forcing a kid to dress up in drag and do some sort of sexualized performance would absolutely be unhealthy, abnormal and completely disgusting.</p>

<p>But none of those 3 articles contain anything like that. All three are about kids who have made their own decisions to be themselves regardless of what others, including their parents, think.</p>

<p>No one is advocating for making children dress up in drag to be paraded around for the enjoyment of adults. Your argument is a straw-man, sir.</p>

<p>And I am not embarrassed to be a liberal, nor do I know anyone who is.  If anything, I would think it would be embarrassing to be a conservative--to have voted for a president who has surrounded himself with criminals.  The Mueller investigation has already turned out 5 guilty pleas/verdicts, and they&#39;re getting closer and closer to the Donald himself.  It should be embarrassing to have supported someone who is looking more and more likely to end up being one of the most corrupt presidents in American history.</p>

<p>Hell, just yesterday Trump was implicated in the commission 2 separate felonies in Michael Cohen&#39;s guilty plea, by Cohen himself, while <em>under oath</em>.  And today the state of New York filled civil suit against Trump, Don Jr, Eric, Ivanka and the Trump Organization and Trump Foundation, and it&#39;s looking very likely that that civil suit will balloon into at least one criminal suit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many concerning statistics about gay men, childhood abuse, and pedophilia. More studies need to be carried out.

    <div class="md"><p>Having been a therapist for over 20+years treating survivors of sexual abuse I can tell you first hand from my clinical experience that far more acts of sexual abuse go UNREPORTED than get reported... And the majority of those cases that I have seen are typically straight men abusing young girls. So since there&#39;s a huge percentage of unreported sexual abuse happening, I caution any conclusions being drawn from research that is based on what&#39;s reported.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is too true. I didn&#39;t feel safe to disclose until I was a teenager and even then my mom denied it as possible and called me a liar had a huge fit (She has borderline personality disorder) cried to my dad on phone later (he was on business trip) and no one mentioned it again. I never thought of reporting it to authorities and after that wouldn&#39;t dare tell anyone again until I was in a long term relationship and struggling with intimacy.</p>

<p>My abuser was my &quot;uncle&quot; cousin from my aunt. My mom&#39;s family. She and 2 of her sisters were raped daily by her dad.  He preferred girls until they were old enough to fought him off I guess. And they shielded the youngest girl. </p>

<p>They didn&#39;t think about the young boy they called a brother... I guess to hide what was happening their mom took the child as her own and hid pregnancy of the 2nd oldest daughter.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so shameful to even talk &quot;anonymous&quot; on Reddit. I cannot imagine telling someone face to face.  And I&#39;ve had to piece this together as my mom can barely talk about what happened to her. I would get bits and pieces.  She finds showers traumatic still in her 60s and avoids them. Her dad used to watch them.</p>

<p>Anyway my point is that I think many of these sickest pedophiles will change their preference if no one else is available. And I think men have an even harder time admitting they were sexually abused. Fear of being homosexual is still very real for many men. I think my father would die before he admitted some man did something like that to him.</p>

<p>How can we know what the real statistics should be?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the courage it took to share your sexual abuse trauma that you suffered. I&#39;m genuinely sorry that you never received the support you needed about it and hope at some point, when you feel ready, you can find professional help to process it so you can feel free of the shame...</p>

<p>On a different note, you raise a very important methodical question...Perhaps to get a closer idea of a truer representation, a random sample of therapists with similar caseloads/amounts of clients across the U. S. could report how many clients they are seeing who have shared in therapy childhood sexual abuse and how many never reported it. It would certainly be a worthwhile study! I believe these findings would be quite ALARMING!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>man there are alot of people jumping on to defend homosexuality.  Research is almost always bias one way or another, but just looking at numbers and coming up with you own analysis is the way to go.  But I for one think that the reason for the number being higher among homosexuals is that homosexuality is not natural,  it is unnatural sexual perception. So it is no surprise that people who are living this way are more likely to take it a step farther.  I&#39;m not sure what to do with the info but it is info none the less.  If anything it just shows the sexual decay of our society. and Im not saying this is new to societies but it is being brought out and made acceptable.  It started with accepting homosexuality, even teaching and promoting it.  now we are seeing the normalization of pedophilia.  It is nothing less than and indicator of a morally deficient culture.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will confirm you theory.</p>

<p>I had a homosexual leaning in my past, until very recently. I am still working through my issues.</p>

<p>But I can confirm that when you go down one step of sexual activities, the next step is not that far away. I am not going to go into details about the other things that I participated in, but I can say that you give it an inch it will take a mile. </p>

<p>Look a porn addicting for example, people get conditioned by cartoons, then to harder and harder things.</p>

<p>you are what you eat, or in this case consume with your eyes.</p>

<p>Protect yourself, and you will protect the world.</p>

<p>Be the shining light, the example to the rest, so that they can follow. </p>

<p>don&#39;t do it for accolades, rewards, but do it because it is the morally upstanding thing to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your courage to speak out. This thread has several brave people actually.</p>

<p>I am female and was sexually abused as a child by my uncle. He was abused by my grandfather who I guess after his 4 daughters were old enough to escape his raping turned on the young boy (I believe his son with one of my aunts).</p>

<p>I have no idea what happened to him after I was relieved to hear he was in prison 7 years later when I was 14. We had moved across the country when I was 7.  Luckily for me and my sister and neither.</p>

<p>Anyway, I am not homosexual but I have had other issues with trust and self loathing. Mom told me I made it up to hurt her when I finally disclosed when I was 15.</p>

<p>I took too much pleasure in some bondage I guess being a masochist isn&#39;t that surprising.  I flirted with it but ran when I saw a full consent form from a &quot;master&quot;. My early foundation loving Christ helped me immensely.  Saved me.</p>

<p>I recently heard a short speech from the daughter of the famous Fantasy author Marion Zimmer Bradley. The horrors that woman perpetrated on her daughter pale only to what her father did to her and other children.</p>

<p>This brings me back to the thread. Thanks for following along.</p>

<p>Her father claimed he raped and abused children, boys being his preference, to &quot;make them gay&quot; and thus superior beings not &quot;chained to social conformity and hetero norms&quot; or whatever.  I will try and find the video of her speech.</p>

<p>She is convinced, and makes excellent argument, that many or even most, homosexuals and other &quot;abnormal sexuality&quot; is at root caused by abuse in childhood.</p>

<p>Now I want to say I have no hate or prejudice against adults that seek consenting adults for whatever in private.  I do hope they find love and stability over the danger and empty loneliness of promiscuity.  </p>

<p>I think also this needs to be studied if anyone is willing.  Or maybe we can figure out how to end all these child abusers and see what happens with future generations that enjoyed innocence in childhood. Mine was broken at age 5 and it&#39;s my greatest wish no child every goes through it ever again.</p>
