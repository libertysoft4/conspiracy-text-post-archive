<p>Could just be a coincidence. Maybe.</p>

<p>In her book, <em>Tranceformation of America</em>, Cathy O&#39;Brien details how he raped, tortured and hunted her when she was just 12 years old:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.e-reading.club/chapter.php/87570/16/OBrien%2C_Phillips_-_Trance_Formation_of_America.html">https://www.e-reading.club/chapter.php/87570/16/OBrien%2C_Phillips_-_Trance_Formation_of_America.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>She explains how high level politicians play a hunting game called “A Most Dangerous Game” where they either hunt men or hunt little kids in a military enclosed wilderness. When they catch the kids, they rape them in the office.</strong> Here is what O’Brian confesses happened in her book “Tranceformation America”:</p>

<p>Dick Cheney had an apparent addiction to the &quot;thrill of the sport.&quot; He appeared obsessed with playing A Most Dangerous Game as a means of traumatizing mind control victims, as well as to satisfy his own perverse sexual kinks. My introduction to the game occurred upon arrival at the hunting lodge near Greybull, Wyoming, and it physically and psychologically devastated me. I was sufficiently traumatized for Cheney&#39;s programming as I stood naked in his hunting lodge office after being hunted down and caught. Cheney was talking as he paced around me, &quot;I could stuff you and mount you like a jackalope and call you a two legged dear. Or I could stuff you with this (he unzipped his pants to reveal his oversized penis) right down your throat, and then mount you. Which do you prefer?</p>

<p>Blood and sweat became mixed with the dirt on my body and slid like mud down my legs and shoulder. I throbbed with exhaustion and pain as I stood unable to think to answer such a question. &quot;Make up your mind,&quot; Cheney coaxed. Unable to speak, I remained silent. &quot;You don&#39;t get a choice, anyway. I make up your mind for you. That&#39;s why you&#39;re here. For me to make you a mind, and make you mine/ mind. You lost your mind a long time ago. Now I&#39;m going to give you one. Just like the Wizard (of Oz) gave Scarecrow a brain, the Yellow Brick Road led you here to me. You&#39;ve &#39;come such a long, long way&#39; for your brain, and I will give you one.&quot;</p>

<p>The blood reached my shoes and caught my attention. Had I been further along in my programming, I perhaps would never have noticed such a thing or had the capability to think to wipe it away. But so far, I had only been to MacDill and Disney World for government/ military programming. At last, when I could speak, I begged, &quot;If you don&#39;t mind, can I please use your bathroom?&quot;</p>

<p>Cheney&#39;s face turned red with rage. He was on me in an instant, slamming my back into the wall with one arm across my chest and his hand on my throat, choking me while applying pressure to the cartorid artery in my neck with his thumb. His eyes bulged and he spit as he growled, &quot;If you don&#39;t mind me, I will kill you. I could kill you --Kill you --with my bare hands. You&#39;re not the first and you won&#39;t be the last. I&#39;ll kill you any time I goddamn well please.&quot; He flung me on the cot-type bed that as behind me. There he finished taking his rage out on me sexually.</p>

I wish you would have listened 18 years ago when some of us where screaming about it then. Of course there is a mass grave. Remember when Rumsfeld told Congress (on c-Span) that he felt DynCorp (and Haliburton) should maybe tone down its human trafficking???? Anyone?? Whose bones are in that grave do you suppose?

<p>America didn&#39;t lose its&#39; soul. America showed its cowardice.  People know there&#39;s to many holes in the official version, but to fully face what happened on 9/11 requires to many people to face the possibility of having to give up their comforts and conveniences.  Acting on one&#39;s conscience is a risky endeavor.  Protesting is risky.  Speaking out is risky.</p>

<p>America chickened out after 9/11.  Its easier for the majority to remain silent, turn away and stay &quot;safe&quot; in their homes rather than hold our government accountable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, at risk of sounding crazy, there&#39;s some credibility to the whole child trafficking suspicions that surround numerous political figures, Hollywood and people in positions of power throughout the world.  It&#39;s thinking that Trump represents a break from that or that he&#39;s some savior that&#39;s the bizarre and insane part.  He&#39;s an installed puppet just as Hillary Clinton would have been as far as I&#39;m concerned and all this shit on TV about liberals vs conservatives being diametrically opposed is just a smokescreen to hide the fact America is run by a cabal of corporate executives who use the two-party system and their media empire to sow division among the people and give the impression we have freedom.  So maybe I&#39;m as crazy as this douchebag calling me a pedophile, but I don&#39;t run around calling people pedophiles because I don&#39;t agree with them.  I wait for some evidence first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You beat me to it.  I agree with your last few posts. Just because we didn&#39;t vote for Trump and fall for his bullshit doesn&#39;t mean we voted for Hillary either.  We&#39;re actually looking for a real change,  not the same bullshit with a new face.  Ron Paul is my president.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s pissing me off that all the Q subs got shut down and now we have to hear &quot;trumps gonna save us&quot; all day. </p>

<p>I try to be optimistic,  it would be cool if Q was legit but I&#39;m just not convinced.  I know these things take time but every deadline comes and goes.  I see Q&#39;s beliefs slowly merging with TPTB. Get the idiots hopeful with an antihero,  then have the anti hero talk for you.  They will listen.  </p>

<p>I feel like all credibility was lost when he started talking about regime change in Iran. Like WTF? Now we&#39;re talking about military tribunals and Martial law? Jesus Christ.  Years ago fellow Conspiracy theorists would fight these ideals because they would think about the future enough to realize these are bad ideas.  </p>

<p>Instead they praise Alex Jones getting fucked out of his freedom of speech, not realizing that it sets a dangerous precedent and anyone who doesn&#39;t agree with the official narratives could be next.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whatever became of the autopsies and DNA results from the bodies fund in the mass grave? That would be the most important and telling pieces of evidence as to who those victims are, how they got there, and what if any connections they might have to each other and to people like Cheney.</p>

<p>The geographic relevance or significance of the mass grave location is probably more important than the distance to Cheney&#39;s human hunting estate.</p>

<p>Considering the rarity of mass grave discoveries in the US, finding one in such close proximity to Cheney&#39;s murder ranch is certainly reasonable grounds for suspicion considering his known violent history and passion for hunting the ultimate prey. The further they drive to dump the bodies, the higher the risk of getting caught with them. 35-40 miles seems like a pretty safe middle ground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easier just to ignore it. The book is absolute trash though. I have no doubt the stuff contained in the book is in the realm of possibilities, but it has some pretty outrageous claims that I don&#39;t think are factual. She definitely has been abused, but I&#39;m still skeptical of most of what she says. George Bush had a reptilian holographic costume? Fuck outta here!! </p>

<p>Future Diary had the scene with the rich dude hunting people with his mechanical dogs. Psycho Pass had some rich psychopath who built an underground hunting arena, he even had a duck hunting uniform if memory serves correct.</p>

<p>IDK if you&#39;ve seen it. A guy/group sets this up for rich people to hunt homeless vets who get paid and agree to partake in New Orleans/The Bayou. Kind of seemed plausible enough to me even back then.</p>
