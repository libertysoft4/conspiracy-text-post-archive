    <div class="md"><p>Quite the opposite, we have an obesity epidemic because people started following the guidelines.  This extreme over-consumption of carbohydrates leads to insulin spikes which then lower blood sugar too much which then makes you extremely hungry again.

    <div class="md"><p>Careful, that kind of highly acid-forming diet causes other problems, like gastrointestinal cancers. I strongly recommend you look into adding some alkaline-forming foods to balance out. A simple choice would be to munch some raw or lightly steamed celery in between meals, but there are other options. Oddly enough, fresh lemon is alkaline-forming. It&#39;s a little counterintuitive, but the pH of the undigested food is irrelevant. What you want to look for are foods that form alkaline compounds in your intestines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m extremely skeptical of your claim. All meats produce an acidic environment in your intestinal tract. Ketoacidosis is one possible complication that can occur as a result, but it is not the only concern. The gastrointestinal tract is damaged over time and the acidic environment in your intestines carries over to your blood. It is well documented that Leukemia is accelerated by keto diets. Paleo diets avoid this issue by allowing vegetables and greens along with meats.   </p>

<p>Granted, plenty of Americans do much worse every day with fried and processed foods. However, I still believe it is prudent to consider throwing in some kind of alkaline-forming food if your diet is mostly carnivore. Is a stalk or two of celery a day really going to mess up your results?  </p>

<p>I understand the short term results are very encouraging, but how sure are you about the long term results? If you think you can explain why zero carb avoids the acidity issue, I would be very interested. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a vegan.  Eat what you want.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve just had success in the areas I began the diet for.  My relationship with food has been reset.  I don&#39;t eat until stuffed anymore.  Allergies are gone.  Inflammation (including some mild edema in my lower extremities) is gone.  I wake up refreshed in the morning.  I&#39;m losing inches but not a lot of weight.  I&#39;ve gained muscle without exercise.  </p>

<p>This way of eating is not for everyone.  It&#39;s probably very dangerous for some people with certain existing conditions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t need to do keto. I gave up sugar bombs like soda and candy a few years ago, and I&#39;ve lost about a pound month since then without even trying. This was weight that I&#39;ve been hauling around for well over 2 decades, unable to make a dent in it with countless diets and exercise regimes. I still generally eat like crap, I just drink water and pass on the dessert, and I look and feel significantly better for it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s tough at first, but before I knew it the cravings stopped, and over time even the thought of a mountain dew or bowl of ice cream started to make me feel gross. Not only that, but it&#39;s been over 2 years since my last post-lunch &#39;daily&#39; nap. My energy is constant, and I <em>never</em> experience ravenous hunger anymore. I get more of a &#39;i could eat something&#39; feeling, it&#39;s never an emergency anymore, which makes it easy to pass up drive-thrus.</p>

<p>Yeah I know there are a lot of enthusiastic anti-sugar advocates on the web that can get preachy and annoying, and I realize that I may be guilty myself on occasion, but it&#39;s hard not to shout it from the rooftops after experiencing the difference and realizing the extent to which we&#39;ve been lied to.</p>

<p>What people dont realize is that High fat diets provide the <em>right amount of fuel. There is no dip, there is no hunger. There is no correlation to heart issues.

And the fact that a high fat diet can literally cure</em>ANY* type 2 diabetic?? Lets talk about it.

    <div class="md"><p>Losing fat is insanely healthy. You can feel your heart beating more clearly, and cells rejuvenating faster. I’m not kidding. Your body ‘refreshes’ noticeably quicker with less fat.</p>

<p>I lost 30 lbs in 3 months. Here’s how I did it (it’s also super easy):</p>

<p>Buy TONS of salad and fruit. That’s it.</p>

<p>I do the store premade salads (with meat, cheese, dressing), and I cheat a lot. I still lose fat insanely fast. I do a very minimal workout. As a guy, I do hold a semi-squat and wave my arms for a few minutes, as an ab workout (bowing and so forth like a Muslim) and then I do a set of 40 semi-push ups. I do this 3 times a day about every other day. No sweat, about 10 minutes per time.</p>

<p>For food, in effect I avoid all sugars, fats. Boil or grill meat (removing fat with a grate, towel, or by boiling in water). No grains, bread (it’s really just sugar and fat that makes it tasty). Low amount of milk, cheese, butter. Lots of fish. It’s not expensive either really. The most unhealthy thing I do is a coffee most days (plus smoking). But smoking &amp; alcohol add more weight than you’d think.</p>

<p>If I drink a few beers I can easily gain 5 lbs. Alcohol does something to radically increase food absobtion and hunger for a day or two after.</p>

<p>But OMG is just adding tons of fruit to a diet phenomenal. Like 3 bananas per day. I make a fruit + milk cocktail, 1,000% better than cereal. Better energy, better taste.</p>

<p>If I don’t cheat, I lose like 5 lb per week, but 2 lbs per week with 1 day of drinking and regular cheat meals when out with company (like 2 slices pizza every other day).</p>

<p>But fruit + salad REALLY loses a ton of weight, it’s super tasty, high energy, and reasonably cheap. I lose like 1 lb day with 3 salads, but have 1 at least everyday. I eat all the fruit I can’t but about 3 bananas normally.</p>

<p>Coffee helps but unhealthy. Muddles the mind &amp; emotions. Alcohol packs on pounds. Smoking doesn’t seem to add much but sometimes (weakens the mind, encourages gratification, reduced mental stamina).</p>

<p>Was 215 lb, now 185 lb. Going until I hit 165 lb, probably like 2 months. That will give me sexy abs. Why not. I feel better, recovery faster from injury, look better, body functioning better, and mind still sharp and fast cause fruit :)</p>

<p>Take care guys &amp; gals. Good luck.</p>

Anecdotally they are also the most difficult and demanding residents to deal with in both attitude and medical requirements so carers will go to great lengths to avoid working on the ward they are housed in. Go figure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You will however find plenty of obese people there in there 30’s-50’s. I have an “aunt” (for lack of a better title) that’s been in the same nursing home as her own mother since her early 40’s. She gets government assistance which she uses to stay in the home. she has never worked, she inherited her family home and it’s a matter of time until it’s condemned, in the brief stint she lived there alone she trashed it, she’s never payed anything toward it, once water and electric went off is when she jumped ship to the nursing home. </p>

<p>All this to say that obesity isn’t usually just a “born this way” condition, it’s a life style of simply not caring for yourself. If not caring for yourself becomes common place then we may as well be literal swine</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OMG you guys have to watch a movie called &quot;Branded&quot;. It describes an imaginary plot to rekindle the fast food industry by running a scheme very similar to this one. </p>

<p>They create a reality show about large women losing weight. They get the whole country emotionally involved with the very sweet, very large finalist. The last step is cosmetic surgery to remove fat. The whole country holds its breath. The girl slips into a coma, and the producers become pariahs. Fat becomes the new beautiful, partially in memorial to the comatose victim. The fast food industry thrives.  I&#39;m not going to tell you how the vegan marketers respond because you won&#39;t believe me</p>

<p>Branded is a MUST see for all conspiracy consumers</p>

<p>It is really difficult to explain the premise of the movie so I always have a hard time recommending it in a way that gets people interested in it. </p>

<p>Its all about advertising as a form of propaganda and &quot;brands&quot; have a literal life of their own. Or maybe the protagonist just sees it that way? I actually want to watch it again myself.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the structure of control that&#39;s relevant. The guys with the products/money look to the master marketer as a hired gun of sorts. The advertiser can literally make or break them, no matter how rich they are.</p>

<p>You want me to make people fat? You want me to make them thin? I can make people want whatever you want them to want. </p>

<p>The desires that grew out of people were cool, too. It wasn&#39;t hunger, which is natural - it was desire which is not. </p>

<p>That stuff with the brands taking on a life of their own was really weird, but the idea is this: You&#39;ve seen people with company logos tattooed on their skin, right? That&#39;s an infection. That&#39;s what this movie is really about. And Stalin didn&#39;t invent brands - the Church did. Flags and logos are used to separate and differentiate people. They aren&#39;t something we employ to our advantage - they are something that employs us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a good rundown. </p>

<p>I agree with the brands = an infection thing. its a metaphor in the context of everyday life. I just wonder if the movie was treating them as real or not in its own universe. All the red cow ritual stuff and the constellation speaking. I guess all that was &quot;in his head&quot; technically in the movie as well though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually it was a bull, not a cow. Major disjointed writing/directing snafu, or another attempt at obstruction. This is going to sound like a stretch, but I believe when used metaphorically horns equate to the moon.  In the last installment of the Matrix, they flew way up into the sky, glimpsed the moon, and fell back to earth to do business. Same thing in the Tomorrowland movie. The template seems to require the heroes to be able to &#39;see&#39; the moon before they can be really effective. Deeply esoteric stuff - just like the ritual of the Red Bull.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a white bull that they used in the movie, and if I&#39;m not mistaken he covered himself with its blood, right? Either way it was the white horns that got my attention. Shepherding is nurturing. I don&#39;t think they kill their prize animals without expectations. Besides the movies mentioned I&#39;ve seen ancient poetry that refers to the crescent and the horns interchangeably. Like I said - deeply esoteric - nothing you&#39;ll find on Wikipedia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My nephew must stay in ketosis per doctor&#39;s orders due to his Glut 1 deficiency disorder.  His brain lacks the ability to transform glucose to energy, and was causing seizures and multiply development issues for 5 years.  Until they move back to Ohio from Nevada where they misdiagnosed him for the first 5 years of his life.  The keto diet has saved him from a life of total dependence on his parents.  Since beginning the keto diet the seizures have stopped completely(off meds completely), he can walk and run with out stumbling or falling, he speaks clearly and is functioning highly at school.  It&#39;s a newer discovered disorder(Dillion was the second in Ohio to be diagnosed), which many think has been misdiagnosed as epilepsy for years,since one of the symptoms is the type of seizure Dillion was having.  So if you have a young child that is on medication for seizures but still has seizures no matter the dosage or changing medication along with troubles walking and talking.  Please ask your physician to test for the genetic defect of Glut-1.  Keto diet is not a killer and is one of the most ridiculous things I have ever heard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. Because any diet is just that. A diet. It needs to be a permanent lifestyle alteration. Needs to become habitualised. Everyone I know except for one (out of about a dozen people) have all had great success with keto. Only to stop the diet because they missed their carbs and gained some, if not all, of it back. I eat whatever the hell I want because I eat strictly organic or Chipotle and workout like a motherfucker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually have some studies that don&#39;t support the whole insulin histamine response effects on metabolism if you&#39;re interested. The only dramatic conclusions in these studies however is when something is drastically changed, such as an all sugar diet, or none. But another issue is, this is entirely dependent on the person. And while the majority of people respond similar, you have others where they&#39;re much more sensitive to change and aren&#39;t as adaptive.</p>

<p>The best one can do is follow the 80/20 rule when it comes to eating habits. These lifestyle changes like Intermittent fasting, or Keto have very negligible changes in terms of health, while they may have a huge impact on someone specific, it&#39;s entirely subjective. But currently as it stands, the research doesn&#39;t support keto as being more effective than any other approach when it comes to weight loss, even compared to a high carb strict diet, which only fuels the calorie argument. The majority of people jumping on keto were most likely following bad eating habits to begin with, which explains any drastic change once switching to keto. Keto is by no means magical, but it can be for some which is why it should be an approach for specific people. </p>

<p>I lean towards the balance approach when it comes to this subject. Exercise enough, 70-80% of food giving you what your body needs daily, moderate carbs, moderate fats. Intermittent fasting. That&#39;s just me. It&#39;s an interesting subject though that sparks a lot of debate because people usually go off repeated rhetoric or what&#39;s worked amazing for them. But the research would clearly say otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh yea I do believe oreos and icecream taste good. How does that make me addicted to sugar? There is 0 grams of added sugar in my diet for most of the week, and I eat icecream about once or twice a week. Don&#39;t make assumptions, they basically invalidate whatever argument you have to begin with.</p>

<p>Garbage is subjective. I think a couple cookies a day in addition to the majority of foods you eat throughout the day giving you the sufficient macro/micronutrients is perfectly fine and healthy. You&#39;re the kind of person who probably thinks eating a couple oreos automatically makes one unhealthy. This is essentially an eating disorder by itself, and elects to ignore proper nutritional balance.</p>

<p>&quot;If I want a quick and dirty high I&#39;d honestly rather smoke crack or meth.&quot;</p>

<p>Yea because treating one addiction (which you assumed I have based on my comment) for another is totally logical. At least use proper reading comprehension to avoid making inferences. It really does go a long way.</p>

<p>And again, you&#39;re putting specific foods into categories such as &quot;unhealthy&quot;. You&#39;re ignoring the fact that your daily consumption is what matters, not nitpicking a minority of your calories coming from a couple cookies. If you want to leave out sugar completely that&#39;s fine, but don&#39;t spew false information without proper pretense. I honestly feel sorry for you if you think you can&#39;t indulge in moderation and be healthy, but I don&#39;t know the current state of your health to begin with. Let&#39;s just ignore the fact that any basis for the sugar scare is because of the majority of people eating the majority of their calories coming from added sugar, are lacking adequate fiber, water, macro/micronutrients making them unhealthy to begin with. Other than that, the countless studies I have posted to educate some people in here about keto, carbs/sugar, body composition in relevance to macronutrients/calories, has mostly garnered downvotes. Unfortunately people don&#39;t like being educated. It goes against common rhetoric or their own personal beliefs what doesn&#39;t support the scientific literature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry to burst your bubble but yes, calories are the determiner of weight loss primarily consisting of fat, which is what the majority of people refer to when discussing weight loss/gain. Glycogen depletion is irrelevant as it&#39;s very short term, as is water depletion. Weight fluctuates 24 hours a day for each individual. My criticism isn&#39;t based off keto itself, but rather keto dwellers who seem to get very offended when you show research contradicting their superior method, which you&#39;re showing examples of. Egocentrism is a toxic thing, and based off your comment history, I&#39;m not very surprised. And your other comment to me is wrong and entirely personal opinion by the way so I&#39;m gonna make the response for that brief. But I&#39;d love to see your research regarding your statements if you don&#39;t mind.</p>

<p>Keto is not high protein, and no one in the study was in ketosis.</p>

<p>Am I misunderstanding this?  It seems to say a low glycemic diet results in more weight lost in fat than a high glycemic diet, even when the calorie deficit is the same.  Again, no one in ketosis.</p>

<p>20% carb is not ketogenic.  It also said the low carb eaters needed less insulin.  Imagine what 5% or 0% carb would do for their need of insulin.</p>

<p>Another study that says nothing about ketosis, and advocates consuming more unsaturated fat (really?).</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna stop here, because I looked through the others and none are involving people in ketosis, and all are working from the assumption that caloric deficit is necessary to see any weight loss.  This is a problem because many people, especially people in ketosis,  actually need to eat more to lose weight.  Our bodies naturally burn less when they are given less.  If your body thinks food is scarce, you will burn fewer calories.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.2keto.com/volek-2008/">http://blog.2keto.com/volek-2008/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://blog.2keto.com/saslow-2014/">http://blog.2keto.com/saslow-2014/</a></p>

<p>There are countless people who have gotten off of diabetes medication, heart disease medication, and cholesterol medication from going keto.  There are clear mechanisms that explain why restricting carbs to 5% or less, and keeping insulin responses low (best achieved by fasting) will result in all of these things.</p>

<p>The unfortunate thing is there are so few good studies on ketosis in humans.  To say insulin is irrelevant because studies in which every single participant ate a diet that requires much more insulin than a keto diet, doesn&#39;t prove much at all - especially as it relates to the sustained low levels of insulin that a keto dieter or faster can easily achieve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You critiquing the studies I&#39;ve posted that actually have relevance, meanwhile you post two studies that are completely faulty to begin with and don&#39;t support your argument. I&#39;ll quote them.</p>

<p>First study:
&quot;12-week study comparing two hypocaloric diets (approximately 1,500 kcal): a carbohydrate-restricted diet (CRD) (%carbohydrate:fat:protein = 12:59:28) and a low-fat diet (LFD) (56:24:20) in 40 subjects with atherogenic dyslipidemia.&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;re using a cherry picked study of 40 subjects with atherogenic dyslipidemia? Then it ends with a &quot;We reckon&quot;
Terrible study. But no surprise from the source.</p>

<p>The next study:
&quot;Randomized Controlled (Pilot) study of a Low carb ketogenic diet (LCKD) for overweight or Obese adults with non insulin dependant type 2 diabetes or prediabetes.  Control arm was given a medium carbohydrate, low fat, calorie restricted, carbohydrate counting diet (MCCR) consistent with guidelines from the American Diabetes Association.&quot;</p>

<p>Again another cherry picked study on a keto website no less, that has no relevance or peer review. It doesn&#39;t give any detail to what the study entitles. First try to dissect my studies that actually have relevance and support my point. Then come back with sources that help prove yours. You&#39;re on the keto hype train while some of us have actually researched this stuff for years while you googled and looked for whatever you could find that sounds like a supporting argument for keto despite it&#39;s flaws and irrelevance. </p>

<p>I can tell you went on google and had to find a keto website to support your argument. Not only are these terrible studies with any significance, they don&#39;t support your point. I&#39;m really not surprised though, All things considered, you aren&#39;t going to find studies proving your point because they don&#39;t exist and the low carb scare has been debunked. When you&#39;re done keto dwelling, at least read my sources instead of skipping to the conclusions of said sources. And yes my studies to have relevance, you&#39;re making a strong statement saying carbs are bad and are the main cause of people gaining weight, when research proves otherwise. Your downvotes in my attempt to educate you is quite pathetic to by the way. I&#39;m not even going to respond to your other comment as it has nothing of substance and is purely opinion based. And yes my studies to have relevance, you&#39;re making a strong statement saying carbs are bad and are the main cause of people gaining weight, when research proves otherwise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s take people who have eaten a high diet that would require very large amounts of insulin, and give them a diet that only needs a moderate to large amount of insulin, and then conclude that insulin plays no role in weight loss.  Nevermind that we never attempted a diet that only needs small amounts of insulin.  We can conclude from people who have always had a diet requiring large amounts of insulin, who had a short intervention where they needed only a little less insulin, that insulin plays no role.  Sure.</p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>The only human population that was ever exposed to a ketogenic diet for a prolonged period of time, enough time for them to genetically adapt, genetically adapted to never enter ketosis because they have a high rate of a metabolic mutation, the &quot;CPT1A Arctic variant&quot;.  This mutation makes fasting incredibly dangerous for arctic people and actually prevents them from becoming ketonic because of the way their bodies process fats (their CPT1A gene operates at around 20% of normal, but does so in both fed and unfed states.  So, the only people ever exposed to this ketogenic diet, rather than be in a state of near constant ketosis, instead adapted in such a way to make ketosis a near impossibility, as it would be life threatening.  This tells us that individuals without this mutation, who were likely in near constant ketosis, were not fit enough to reproduce at a rate that would limit the recessive mutation from spreading to over half of the native population.  And now people are intentionally subjecting their bodies to a ketogenic diet, partly based on the false idea that Inuit and other Arctic people ate and thrived on a ketogenic diet.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have particularly good records of pre-civilization times, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a stretch to think that hunters would regularly enter ketosis, especially in the winter.  Artctic people had virtually no way to ever get out of ketosis, and they lived in a very particular environment.  I don&#39;t use arctic people as evidence for keto, but they aren&#39;t particular good evidence against keto either (since they&#39;re quite particular).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you miss the point that natural selection strongly selected for the mutation that makes it so they don&#39;t enter ketosis, despite their environment forcing a diet that would make humans without the gene go into ketosis?  This happened to explorers who tried to eat what the natives were eating, which is why they assumed arctic people lived in a perpetual state of ketosis...until early scientists found the arctic people weren&#39;t in ketosis.  The other confounding factor when comparing any ancient hunters to today is that these hunters ate parts of the animals raw (skin, organs of diving marine mammals in the case of arctic people), and those parts were a source of glycogen which supplemented for their lack of traditional forms of carbohydrates found in diets of those in more temperate climate.</p>

<p>The other thing is that all of the examples of ketosis you mention are temporary, not prolonged or lifelong conditions.  Based on the spread of a recessive trait that protects arctic people from entering ketosis, while also confering negatives such as higher infant mortality, it is clear that the survival rate of those who would enter ketosis much easier was not nearly as high as for those with the gene mutation.  This suggests that prolonged ketosis has overall negative effects that if imposed by the environment over generations, people will adapt to avoid it.  This suggests we shouldn&#39;t subject ourselves to prolonged ketosis as called for with the keto diet.</p>

<p>Who says you need to be in keto all the time forever?

<p>The risk of ketosis is much lower than death from diabetes and heart disease.  There are not droves of long term keto dieters dying early, quite the opposite - they&#39;re getting healthier.</p>

<p>The real reason is because doing keto automatically makes one have healthier eating habits, thus making a caloric deficit easier and more common on keto.</p>

<p>-So keto works because without it people are eating all day long from their supposed addiction to carbs? Seriously? The carb scare is real!</p>

<p>&quot;If someone breaks their addiction to carbs, they are only gonna eat when they&#39;re hungry as opposed to eating to satisfy their addiction.&quot;</p>

<p>-You know who eats when they&#39;re hungry too? Obese people. And I can assure you, their &quot;addiction&quot; to carbs has nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>&quot;Peanut butter is not particularly fatty - it has carbs as well (especially if it&#39;s processed peanut butter). Some short ribs will fill you up longer than bread will, I guarantee it.&quot;</p>

<p>-Peanut butter isn&#39;t particular fatty? Their is no food that is particular fatty. If you ate in a surplus of calories of ketogenic type foods, you will gain weight, likewise if you ate a surplus of calories in all jolly ranchers. Does this mean they&#39;re both fatty foods? So peanut butter has carbs, especially if it&#39;s processed peanut butter? Peanut butter being processed means it&#39;s more fatty? Again define the term fatty. Short ribs will fill you up longer than bread? Maybe in your case, but whole wheat would fill me up much longer than ribs.</p>

<p>Not sure what you&#39;re on about. You&#39;re basically spewing bro science as they call it, without anything to back up said bro science. At least offer something of substance. You aren&#39;t really helping your argument. And from my last comment to you, I&#39;d still like to see your research that may possibly counteract mine, I love learning new things.</p>

<p>Have you ever met people?  Do you think the average person could miss one or two meals and not become angry (often called &quot;hangry&quot;)?  Ask some people you know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You know who eats when they&#39;re hungry too? Obese people. And I can assure you, their &quot;addiction&quot; to carbs has nothing to do with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obese people can&#39;t access the fat in their bloodstream or their stored fat if they eat glucose throughout the day (which keeps insulin levels high).  If they have insulin resistance (which is incredibly common in obese people), they have a harder time using the glucose in their bloodstream.  Obese people are loaded with energy, both stored and in their bloodstream, but they can hardly use any of it.  Thus they end up hungry even though they&#39;ve just eaten.</p>

<p>I bet there are precisely zero people who eat low or no carb who become obese.  Obese people are almost all addicted to carbs, or were addicted to carbs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Their is no food that is particular fatty. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, there are.  Suet, coconut oil, tallow, etc are 100% fat.  Foods like short ribs and fatty cuts of meat are very high in fat.  But I misspoke.  Peanut butter is fatty, it just also has a significant amount of carbs.  Most people also don&#39;t eat peanut butter by itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Peanut butter being processed means it&#39;s more fatty?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It will likely have more carbs if it&#39;s processed since adding various types of sugar is extremely common with peanut butter that&#39;s been processed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe in your case, but whole wheat would fill me up much longer than ribs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;re all different, so maybe a small number of people would be more filled up by whole wheat than fat, but not many.  You may also be confusing a bloated feeling with feeling full.  You may also be confusing the brain fog that comes from a lack of carbs (to a regularly carb consuming person) with hunger.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And from my last comment to you, I&#39;d still like to see your research that may possibly counteract mine, I love learning new things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you like podcasts, I highly recommend the 2 Keto dudes podcast.  They routinely interview working scientist who make completely fact-based arguments as to why high insulin levels and insulin resistance are such a problem for gaining weight.  I know that it sounds like a biased source, but they are extremely militant about not using bad science to support themselves.  Even when epidemiological studies support their arguments, they don&#39;t use them, because they know the massive weaknesses in typically self-reported, uncontrolled, epidemiological studies.</p>

<p>There are a lot of up and coming scientists who want to do the proper controlled studies on a keto diet.  Unfortunately the mainstream nutrition world is stuck in dogmas that they refuse to question.</p>

<p>Nina Teicholz, Gary Taubes, Zoe Harcombe, Ivor Cummings, Tim Noakes, and Gary Fettke are some names to start with if you really want to learn some new things about diet.</p>

<p>Keto very well may not be great long term - I&#39;m always reading more to see what comes out.  But for people with diabetes, &quot;cholesterol&quot; problems (cholesterol is not really the problem or a good marker to use), and heart disease ketosis has clear mechanisms that explain why it&#39;s the best diet for them, at least for some period of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real fantasy diet is the Standard American Diet. Eating 300g/day of carbs is batshit crazy. That&#39;s what the USDA recommends. That&#39;s the fantasy. Keto started with William Banting&#39;s book in 1863. It was so ubiquitous that the word &quot;banting&quot; was in the dictionary, meaning &quot;to lose weight.&quot; Does this sound like a fad? No. It was a conspiracy to erase Banting from history because fat is the VALUE and carb is the profit. Figure it out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you assuming I am a proponent of the Standard American Diet?  3 square meals a day is bullshit, keto and paleo are bullshit, as is every other thing called a &quot;diet&quot;.  They are all fads, even if they have suddenly had a second coming.  Also, while &quot;losing weight&quot; may be a meaning of &quot;banting&quot;, it also means &quot;to be on a diet&quot;.  </p>

<p>I find it ridiculous that that these diets completely demonize sugar and carbs.  Both are invaluable for certain types of physical activity, beneficial gut bacteria, and brain function.  There are studies that show sugars (glucose specifically), which our bodies are generally very effective at regulating, have an integral part to play in forming new memories.  So, eliminating high fructose foods is probably a good idea, but taking out sources of glucose could be detrimental to brain function.  Soluble Fiber, a type of carbohydrate, is essential for gut health and cholesterol regulation in the blood.  Complex carbohydrates are valuable sources of energy for the brain and body, in addition to providing long term energy and regulating insulin production.  </p>

<p>The overt danger of any of these diets is that people who shouldn&#39;t be on them will try them, people will fixate on a certain aspect of the diet and neglect the holistic approach that makes it work for some people, and people will stop the diet then regain their weight back in fat instead of muscle because ketosis cut down their muscle mass and destroyed their metabolism.</p>

There&#39;s something they aren&#39;t telling us! Something doesn&#39;t compute with standard dietary guidlines and the general narrative. I analyzed it for nearly a decade before I had the epiphany: sugar &amp; grains cost pennies per pound, fat &amp; protein cost dollars per pound. The more sugar &amp; carb they can cram into a food, especially if it displaces valuable fat or protein, the more profit you make. Whoever formulated this food gets a massive salary and a promotion. Any scientist willing to push this formula as a &quot;healthy diet&quot; gets proceeds from this massive profit. It&#39;s all about money, not reality or actual scientific studies. </p>

Change your diet and poof, or did you also get on a normal sleep schedule, start exercising, or move away from a stressful group of people or job.  Also, pasta and subway seems like you were going overboard with the carbs if you were not actively exercising to utilize the complex carbohydrates in those foods before your body turned that excess energy into fat.  The importance of doing scientific studies is to find out what exactly causes something else to happen.  There is no long term study of keto in humans.  There is one in mice that showed an increased rate of type 2 diabetes in mice on keto...just food for thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep in mind that carbs these days are not the same as they were 100 years ago. Everything is selected for high sugar (even genetically tweaked) and hyper-processed. None of the energy that goes into cooking, blending or processing these foods is accounted for in the calories  on the label. The more processed a food is, the less chewing and digestion is required, making it far more energy-dense than they want us to know. As far as long term studies, my own life has been a study of LC/HF vs SAD. The biggest conclusion that is obvious to me is that carbs make us pear-shaped and eating fat makes us sexier and more cognitive. Carbs go to your gut. Big guts and waists are linked to all metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes, alzhiemers and cancers. </p>

<p>Stop spreading disinformation.  One mice study performed with a poorly formulated keto diet is an absurd thing to hang an argument on.  Look at the mechanisms of how type II diabetes forms.  It&#39;s not possible to develop diabetes on a keto diet (unless maybe you ate insanely large amounts of dairy all day every day).  Many many people have gotten completely off diabetes medication (their doctors have told them they don&#39;t need it anymore) with a keto diet.  There are clear mechanisms that explain why keto is helpful for anyone with insulin resistance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most gyms with people that lift regularly, granted it would be mostly dudes. The average man that deadlifts once a week should hit that in around a year or so. Strength in squat and deadlifts comes really quickly as the lower half of our bodies can produce a lot of power. It&#39;s rare to see the average dude do too much more than that though. 400-440 pounds or so is around standard. Less than that and it&#39;s a person that doesn&#39;t lift that often, more than that and a person is generally really into lifting. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>There are studies that show sugars (glucose specifically), which our bodies are generally very effective at regulating</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you joking?  40% of Americans have diabetes or pre-diabetes.  Our bodies work hard to quickly remove sugar from our blood because it&#39;s toxic.  Americans need to remove so much sugar from their blood that they end up with insulin resistance.  Our bodies are surely amazing, they can keep up with an absolute onslaught for many years, but you end up with heart disease and diabetes in your 50s or 60s (which is not normal, though it&#39;s becoming normal).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but taking out sources of glucose could be detrimental to brain function.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it&#39;s not.  Your body can make glucose from protein.  In fact, the body is so amazing that it can actually make exactly as much glucose as the brain needs, whenever the brain needs it, by making glucose from protein.</p>

<p>What sounds more sensible?  Eating glucose throughout the day to fuel your brain - resulting in repeatedly raising your blood sugar?  Or not even raising your blood sugar, and allowing the protein you ate be turned into glucose in only the exact amount that you need?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and people will stop the diet then regain their weight back in fat instead of muscle because ketosis cut down their muscle mass and destroyed their metabolism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stop spreading disinformation.  Ketosis spares muscle mass.  You will lose more muscle mass by eating at a caloric deficit with carbs than in ketosis.  If you eat enough protein, you will not lose muscle mass whatsoever on keto.  People&#39;s metabolisms are already destroyed and being destroyed.  Keto is a chance to undo a lot of damage.  Studies have shown keeping large amounts of weight off is almost impossible - except when using a low carb or keto approach.</p>

<p>When is the last time you actually looked at the science around nutrition?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, you want evidence that carbohydrates are essential?  You got it.  There is also some about glucose, of which sources are limited or nonexistent in the Keto diet.</p>

<p>Dietary Fiber intake is inversely associated with risk of Heart Disease.

<p>By modulating food ingestion, digestion, absorption and metabolism, DFs (Dietary Fibers) reduce the risk of hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia and hyperglycemia.

<p>Population studies have shown that whole grain consumption is associated with diminished risk of serious, diet-related diseases.Carbohydrates are important contributors to the health benefits of whole grains.

<p>The fermentation process of Non-polyol low-digestible carbohydrates is highly specialised and leads to the selective stimulation and growth of beneficial gut bacteria, e.g. bifidobacteria.
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1079/BJN2000261">https://doi.org/10.1079/BJN2000261</a></p>

<p>Carbohydrates influence mood and help regulate stress.  Cold pressor stress significantly increased cortisol and reduced mood and cognitive performance, whereas carbohydrates significantly increased plasma Trp/LNAA and positively influenced performance and mood under stress.

<p>The mammalian brain depends upon glucose as its main source of energy, and tight regulation of glucose metabolism is critical for brain physiology. Consistent with its critical role for physiological brain function, disruption of normal glucose metabolism as well as its interdependence with cell death pathways forms the pathophysiological basis for many brain disorders.
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2013.07.001https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2013.07.001">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2013.07.001https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2013.07.001</a></p>

<p>I could do this for pages, but I think the important point is that best case, Keto helps some people lose weight...but worst case, Keto leads to long term brain disorders and poor variation in gut bacteria (which has completely unknown effects given that these bacteria are integral to processing food into usable material and supporting the immune system).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Recent interest in alternative brain fuels (including lactate derived from glucose largely within the brain; refs. 4–6) notwithstanding, glucose is an obligate metabolic fuel for the brain under physiological conditions (7). Because the brain cannot synthesize glucose or store substantial amounts as glycogen in astrocytes, the brain requires a virtually continuous supply of glucose from the circulation. Facilitated diffusion of glucose from the blood into the brain is a direct function of the arterial plasma glucose concentration. The rate of blood-to-brain glucose transport exceeds the rate of brain glucose metabolism at normal (or elevated) plasma glucose levels, but it falls and becomes limiting to brain glucose metabolism when arterial glucose concentrations fall to low levels (8). Thus, hypoglycemia causes brain fuel deprivation and, as a result, functional brain failure.  This condition is most common in diabetics.
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1838950/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1838950/</a></p>

<p>No long term studies have been done regarding low blood sugar levels in keto dieters.  Most keto dieters who are not diagnosed as diabetic will not check their blood sugar levels, and may be at risk for developing type 2 diabetes themselves through blunted suppression of hepatic glucose production by insulin.  So, keto diet may cause development of type 2 diabetes in normal people.  Keto diet reduces blood glucose levels, increasing risk for diabetics to develop DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis), a life threatening condition.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>This is very interesting, good job! I’ve been eating Keto for 6 months after I had twins. The weights just melts off (65 lbs) and I’ve never been happier with no cravings and not having the constant feeling of hunger or needing to snack! Who can argue eating a ridiculous amount of avocado, bacon and cheese daily?!  Sugar is a consumer poison that keeps people addicted to big box products and ill enough to buy into the pharmacy industry for all the health concerns it causes. Simple: stop eating processed garbage. If it requires factory production to make it to your table then your body was not meant to process and digest it. Watch “the magic pill” on Netflix. It does a great job at explaining how our consumer industry is targeted to eat an upside down food pyramid in support of pharmaceutical products that will be needed once diabetes etc kick in from a poor diet!</p>

<p>Many scientists and dietitians. Processed meats like bacon and deli meats are really bad for you and should be eaten in moderation. Red meat is better, but also shouldn&#39;t be eaten more than a couple of times a week, espically if it&#39;s farmed raised (wild red meat is better for you).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glorifying obesity to sell more sugar would be like glorifying strokes to sell more cigarettes.  It doesn&#39;t work that way.  Fat acceptance is pushed by obese people who feel the need to justify their addiction to sugar.  It&#39;s the exact same kind of &quot;I don&#39;t want to live forever&quot; mentality that all addicts fall back on.  The fact that the media is jumping on the fat acceptance train is a response to climbing obesity rates, not declining sugar sales.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keto is good in short intervals, but if you ate Keto for your entire life it could be negative. Your body needs carbs. The laymen&#39;s reason you lose weight is because your body has no carbs to burn, so it consumes fat. The problem is not carb consumption, it&#39;s that so many, like 95% of food at the grocery store is backed with horrible sugars and carbs. This is why in the longterm, a whole food diet is best. You can go plant based, or you can eat meat, but generally buying something from a box or carton or wrapping is a no no. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It most certainly does, which is why keto diet is recommended in intervals to prevent issues, and has only shown to be fully effective in maximum of 12 week intervals. Keto is the exact same state biologically as if your body is starving. Your body simply can not survive a lifetime of consistent ketosis, and studies have shown in animals that continued ketosis can have many adverse long-term symptoms. </p>

<p>I am not arguing against Keto. I do it myself, but it is not sustainable as an every day diet. </p>

<p>Here is a good study and short and long term effects of Keto </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations for or against the use of low-carbohydrate diets, particularly among participants older than age 50 years, for use longer than 90 days, or for diets of 20 g/d or less of carbohydrates.&quot;</p>

<p>This is from the citing reference in the conclusion of that article, which is what this study was based on. &quot;long-term&quot; in this study could mean 70 years following the 3 month (90 day) intervals. Pretty much all Keto studies agree 3 months is the cap for maximum benefits with some being achieved at 6, but these intervals can be followed for your life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just assuring you that unless you substitute Keto as your every day diet for your entire life, you will be very healthy. Keto is best done in 3 month intervals, throughout your life. Most studies show no significant benefit from Keto beyond 3 month cycles, Even if you&#39;re extremely fat. I personally only do keto for 3 months out of the year, but if you&#39;re committed to it for a life-time, most of the studies show you achieve ideal health results in 3 month cycles, taking 1 month off, repeat. This is how it is done for diabetics/epileptics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Inuits did not have a ketogenic diet.  They ate copious quantities of protein, some fat, and little carbohydrates...however they were not found to be in ketosis on their natural diet because they also ate organs, raw skinfat and other parts of marine animals that are high in glycogen.  In fact, they saved most of their fat and blubber because it was more valuable for trade, lighting, and other uses.  Interestingly, Inuits may have developed adaptations to allow for quicker and more efficient transition to a state of ketosis than other human populations, but studies are limited.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>This link goes through the historian and explorer accounts of Inuits diets, showing that all but 1 person found their diet to be non-ketogenic.    That person is Vilhjalmur Stefansson, who was regarded by his contemporaries as &quot;the outstanding humbug in the exploration world at the present time—a persistent, perennial, and congenital liar who for years has made his living by sheer mendacity and skill in handling words. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the science behind keto/carnvore/intermittent fasting/extended fasting is all the same and simple.  </p>

<ul>
<li>by removing sugar (&amp; carbs) the body is able to balance out your blood glucose where your natural insulin has began failing.<br/></li>
<li>Your body will use its natural fat stores (you become fat adapted), you consume foods that require low amounts of insulin, your body normalizes, and the carb cravings hunger and sugar dependence leaves.<br/></li>
<li>The hard part is just the few week transition, but that itself will be life changing for the majority.<br/></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Generalisations like this just aren&#39;t helpful or accurate. 
Keto and paleo both permit a huge variety of food types with a wide spectrum of nutrition profiles. Both diets have the capacity to be extremely healthy or extremely unhealthy, depending on how you implement them. Treating them both like a monolith with an unwavering health bar attached is misleading.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also not really sensible to include fasting in this critique, as the vast majority of westerners with ordinary western diets also do not regularly fast. If anything, people already adhering to weird diets are more likely to embrace IF.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes the sugar industry is trash. Yes eating the majority of your calories coming from a non essential macronutrient in the form of sugar is not good. No keto is not superior towards one other diet when it comes to weight loss. Calories determine your weight loss, keto may only initially help drop water weight quicker because of the absence of carbohydrates. This is a cold hard fact. You cannot refute it as it&#39;s been proven. Keto is not superior. It can help some individuals. It might not be compatible for others. Alot of uneducated people on here bickering. And this is usually the case when it comes to nutrition because common rhetoric is repeated so often, people end up believing it.  </p>

<p>The 80/20 or 70/30 rule is key. Balance is key. Their is no superior method. If 80% of the food you eat contains enough healthy fats, proteins, fiber, micro nutrients, then the rest is negligible. You&#39;re already healthier than 95% of the USAs population. People don&#39;t track what they eat, the amount of calories etc. This is why people are unhealthy. Not because they ate a cookie over an apple. But because they aren&#39;t keeping tabs on what they put into their bodies throughout the day. The carb scare is stupid. You can have sugar everyday. Would sugar itself fall into the 80%? No, unless it&#39;s coming from fruit. Why because fruit has a ton of micronutrients, and has fiber, automatically placing it into the 80%. The problem with sugar is mostly contributed to people consuming to much, and/or in the absence of fiber. Again, the carb scare is stupid and has no basic in the scientific literature for most cases. This is completely dependent on the individual. And I&#39;ll post my research.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple thoughts-how popular is the new Keto diet? I&#39;m out of the loop, but these diets come and go-I can&#39;t see it being a big deal. The atkins thing was anti-carbs and didn&#39;t trigger anything. Why the keto diet? Do you have any figures on its popularity?</p>

<p>Also, I wonder how effective a pro-fat ad campaign will really be. I feel like anti-fat is engrained in us. Maybe in a generation or two, that could change. Would this propaganda be caused by the Keto diet, though? I doubt it. If anything, maybe companies realize they can make more money by making it ok to be fat(eating more-&gt;buying more) or appealing to fat people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Atkins is a keto diet and didn&#39;t go away. They&#39;re are just more-or-less keto diets and they been around longer than you realize, as far as medicine is concerned.</p>

<p>Anti-fat is certainly ingrained, but it&#39;s ass-backwards. Fat is rocket fuel if you&#39;re eating properly otherwise, yet we trim it and toss it.</p>

<p>I fell out of atkins after several successful years and my lowest adult weight. I spent years more trying unsuccessfully to get back and stick to it. I had zero success until I discovered zerocarb. I&#39;ve lost 15 lbs in 3 months and more inches than you&#39;d expect from that weight loss. It&#39;s not for everyone, but those of us who stick to it swear by it. Now food is one thing I literally no longer think about until I&#39;m actually hungry, instead of eating by the clock. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My nephew must stay in ketosis per doctor&#39;s orders due to his Glut 1 deficiency disorder.  His brain lacks the ability to transform glucose to energy, and was causing seizures and multiply development issues for 5 years.  Until they move back to Ohio from Nevada where they misdiagnosed him for the first 5 years of his life.  The keto diet has saved him from a life of total dependence on his parents.  Since beginning the keto diet the seizures have stopped completely(off meds completely), he can walk and run with out stumbling or falling, he speaks clearly and is functioning highly at school.  It&#39;s a newer discovered disorder(Dillion was the second in Ohio to be diagnosed), which many think has been misdiagnosed as epilepsy for years,since one of the symptoms is the type of seizure Dillion was having.  So if you have a young child that is on medication for seizures but still has seizures no matter the dosage or changing medication along with troubles walking and talking.  Please ask your physician to test for the genetic defect of Glut-1.  Keto diet is not a killer and is one of the most ridiculous things I have ever heard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you assuming I am a proponent of the Standard American Diet?  3 square meals a day is bullshit, keto and paleo are bullshit, as is every other thing called a &quot;diet&quot;.  They are all fads, even if they have suddenly had a second coming.  Also, while &quot;losing weight&quot; may be a meaning of &quot;banting&quot;, it also means &quot;to be on a diet&quot;.  </p>

<p>I find it ridiculous that that these diets completely demonize sugar and carbs.  Both are invaluable for certain types of physical activity, beneficial gut bacteria, and brain function.  There are studies that show sugars (glucose specifically), which our bodies are generally very effective at regulating, have an integral part to play in forming new memories.  So, eliminating high fructose foods is probably a good idea, but taking out sources of glucose could be detrimental to brain function.  Soluble Fiber, a type of carbohydrate, is essential for gut health and cholesterol regulation in the blood.  Complex carbohydrates are valuable sources of energy for the brain and body, in addition to providing long term energy and regulating insulin production.  </p>

<p>The overt danger of any of these diets is that people who shouldn&#39;t be on them will try them, people will fixate on a certain aspect of the diet and neglect the holistic approach that makes it work for some people, and people will stop the diet then regain their weight back in fat instead of muscle because ketosis cut down their muscle mass and destroyed their metabolism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Carb loading is fine if you are actively burning calories and not sitting around all day.  There is a reason that high performance athletes eat a shit ton of carbs, along with a shit ton of other food, they need the energy to burn.  Carbs in moderation have numerous proven health benefits to normal people, so swearing them off completely is potentially dangerous to long term health, especially brain health and memory function.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s still entirely subjective. That&#39;s putting everyone into one category where higher fats would be superior. Whole wheat keeps me full much longer than peanut butter for instance. So while keto might be easier to remain in a caloric deficit, for others carb filled grains might do it for another.</p>

<p>The real reason is because doing keto automatically makes one have healthier eating habits, thus making a caloric deficit easier and more common on keto.</p>
