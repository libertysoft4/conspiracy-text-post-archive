        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Until now.</p>

<p>So it seems after all Reddit isn&#39;t run by a bunch of leftie commies.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re wondering why all these subs were targeted for their &quot;hoax&quot; and &quot;shocking&quot; information. I&#39;m guessing money. Advertisers don&#39;t want their products featured on communist or otherwise subs. This is reddit&#39;s attempt at not making the mistake of just deleting subs outright. And deleting Q cult subs was a mistake even if it is well within Reddit&#39;s rights.  </p>

<p>r/conspiracy and a place like r/politics or T_D has enough traffic and pulls in enough money to be exempt from the quarantine, for now. Even though conspiracy and T_D often feature posts that question the official narrative. Possibly calling some things a hoax. Like Vegas or Newtown. </p>

<p>So rejoice and we as a community should push the boundaries of reddit even more. Dare them to hurt their own bottom line. Dare them to quarantine even more. We have nothing to lose but our chains comrades. </p>

<p>Yes. This is sort of my point. By that time reddit actually gets rid of a longstanding sub like this. Reddit will be actually dead and there will be no point in being here anymore. So them banning individual people doesn&#39;t matter when you can make a new account and get a VPN.</p>

<p>This site is dying but it can be saved if the reddit corporation gets their heads out of their ass. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Communism takes many different forms especially because the style of communism is born out of the original system it came from. As Karl Marx has written. In nearly every single communist country in history, communism was created out of dictatorships and kings in feudalism. Which lead to a single communist ruler. Nearing fascism at times. Basically a new king, right?</p>

<p>Americommunism would be different as it would be born from late stage capitalism and automation. You can&#39;t stop it, even in your pitiful life where you claim anyone can be rich. So I assume you are rich. Machines will make human labor obsolete in many different fields and all of us will have to learn forms of engineering to keep the machines doing the work.</p>

<p>The American constitution has no preventive measures against communism except for trying to outlaw their political party. </p>

<p>One could argue. We are almost in communism right now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like most writers of the 19th century, Marx tended to use the terms communism and socialism interchangeably. In his Critique of the Gotha Programme (1875), however, Marx identified two phases of communism that would follow the predicted overthrow of capitalism: the first would be a transitional system in which the working class would control the government and economy yet still find it necessary to pay people according to how long, hard, or well they worked; the second would be fully realized communism—a society without class divisions or government, in which the production and distribution of goods would be based upon the principle “From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.”</p>

<p>the first would be a transitional system in which the working class would control the government and economy yet still find it necessary to pay people according to how long, hard, or well they worked</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All that&#39;s needed is to nationalize the natural resources of country so a single person cannot capitalize on said natural resource. In fact the country right now forces itself to make the natural resources productive. Owners of finite natural resources are usually &quot;encouraged&quot; to mine or drill. At times taking over someone&#39;s property for the resources. </p>

<p>You guys basically believe in a delusional imagined form of Government that has never ever existed anywhere, and never will, and even if tried and failed again, you have this perfect excuse that it was real communism.</p>

<p>Its like telling your disappointed GF after sex that that wasn&#39;t really the real size of your penis, and for her to just wait it out so you can show her the real size. So she gives you another chance, and she&#39;s disappointed during the act while you have a smile because you believe you are proving the delusions that only exists in your own mind.</p>

<p>death is universal and happens in all systems of Gov. 100 MILLION DEATHS by Communism due to gulags, pogroms, people starved, hunted down, food AG shortages, and so on. It&#39;s almost like if you keep something in the hands of 1 group of people, failure can happen quicker and easier than in a free trade market with many players.</p>

<p>Like I said, your an echo chamber and won&#39;t get it. Go live in a Commune for 1 year, then PM after.</p>

<p>Yet most people don&#39;t buy American &quot;solid muscle cars&quot; because the price of gasoline. They buy sedans which Asian companies sold over the gas guzzling nightmares of &quot;muscle cars&quot; Because having a &quot;muscle car&quot; is essential to wealth, right?</p>

<p>No thanks. I will fight to the death to make communism a reality in America. See you on the battlefield 5.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure you are. We have enough historical evidence to say communism never worked, because people doesn&#39;t work that way. You would have to probably alter our genome to remove many survival traits (to suppress natural behaviour like protecting your family, providing for your family, power-hungriness, sociopathy and so on) or do a severe country-wide long-term brainwashing. Neither is possible with our current tech and I consider both very radical with uncertain results (e.g. won&#39;t people go just stupid/lazy b/c state provides everything so they don&#39;t need to study or work hard?) and immoral unless all people choose to undergo this procedure.</p>

<p>My parents lived in a communist country (I was too young to remember), but I have pretty good idea how things were working. Meritocracy being replaced with allegiance to the one best communist party, rats squeling on their neighbours/friends/family to get a better position (more power and rare items, like bananas and old tech lagging behind imperialist west one or more generations), executions for wrongthink, being arrested for long hair, wide-spread powerty where you literally have only food and very little &quot;luxury&quot; items like oranges or ordinary imported clothes (comparable to the cheapest type you can buy now). Science virtually ceased to progress at all, because all your achievements are attributed to the party or leader, so why would scientists bother? Also those more sharp, intelligent, saw things coming and fled from their home rather than live under totalitarian rule (I am guessing most were liberals in the original meaning of the word - pro individuals&#39; rights, thin state, ...). Must I go on?</p>

<p>I believe semi-regulated capitalism is the best working solution humanity currently have. Yes, in US it is a bit wild west from my POV - for example mixing corporate funding with politics is strictly limited and transparent in my country. Nevertheless from all data available to date, your current system is much much better, than what you would get after few years under socialism, or, even worse, communism.</p>

<p>PS: I personally would love to live in a society similar to one depicted in e.g. Star Trek TNG (very close to socialism, no money, social status based on how much you bring to the society, strongly preferred peace with other races [aliens in this context]), but I simply don&#39;t believe we, humans, are capable of it in our current biological form.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a society of kings. We believe that all are sovereign. All are equal.</p>

<p>Though there is no formal legal hierarchy there is a judicial system for adjudicating contractual disputes and criminal level norm infractions. A &quot;king&quot; or &quot;quee&quot; no greater than any other presides over this judiciary as Chief Justice or the judge. </p>

<p>Sure every society will be set up a bit different that&#39;s just how anarchy works but the basic structure of absolute freedom and equality will be the same.</p>

<p>There will be something like a mayor or high King that will be chosen each year through a round robin of arm wrestling and competitive slam poetry among eight other tasks. Our leaders are chosen though deeds, not glorified popularity contests. We believe democracy is Stockholm syndrome. Leaders act for what is right.They do not need to &quot;vote&quot;.</p>

<p>Under anarcho monarchism;</p>

<p>Usury is illegal.</p>

<p>Rent is illegal.</p>

<p>Exploitation is illegal. </p>

<p>Land ownership requires active improvements upon the land. Unimproved land is in the commons. The commons are to be respected. To defile the commons is a serious offence. </p>

<p>Anarchy means no rulers. Not no rules. There are still laws and norms. You can&#39;t just go stealing from other kings...</p>

<p>The same argument has been used with youtube for a while. The reality is youtube just demonetarised everything which doesn&#39;t fit into a very narrow band of allowed narration, irrelevant of any imaginable commercial protest. &quot;Wrong&quot; political thinking isn&#39;t the only thing they target.</p>

<p>But what has been enlightened is how the Elsagate videos didn&#39;t have these problems. If I would be responsible for the Ad budget of a potential advertiser I would be <em>seriously</em> concerned about being associated with that dirt.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty clear to me that all these companies are either now in the opinion shaping business, are pressured by governments, intelligence services or shareholders or plants were placed into positions which decide these policies. The later we can clearly see happened with the Atlantic Council personal employed at reddit.</p>
