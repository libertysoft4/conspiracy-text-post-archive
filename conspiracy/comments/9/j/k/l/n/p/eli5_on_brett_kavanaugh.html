As soon as the prosecutor hit on that point little miss Lindsay Graham went apoplectic for some strange reason.

    <div class="md"><p>I def think he got way more faded as a youth than he&#39;s letting on but i think the sexual assault allegations are a farce. She named multiple people who claims were there and they all denied knowing about the party or about who Kav was. Add to that that she didnt know when or where it took place.. I think they wanted an FBI investigation so they could stroll out more liars and stall for the obvious which is a chance to get the senate back. Kav is a bush lackey so fuck him but its still fuck libs more.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only person that could corroborate the assault is Mark Judge and the GOP refuses to call him to testify. The people she named are the same names he listed as having “skis” with on July 1st. Many experts are saying she is a highly credible witness. He refused to answer a number of questions. He wants nothing to do with an FBI investigation she wants an investigation . Nothing about his demeanor makes me think he’s incapable of assault, nothing about her demeanor made me think she was untruthful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>She has nothing to lose from an investigation as she already admits there are key details she just can&#39;t remember. He has everything to lose from an investigation, even if he knows it will clear his name because an investigation is just another stall tactic. I think Ford has experienced real trauma but I think the Dems are bending her to their will. Feinstein clearly hasn&#39;t been looking out for Fords best interests but rather her own political interests. It is unfortunate that this woman was Abused but I think Kav has ever right to be upset as we move towards guilty until proven innocent. Don&#39;t forget this man is judge who has worked his whole career presuming innocent until proven guilty only to find that the same standards do not apply to him. He definitely partied more than he lets on in high school though haha</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the fact that he “definitely partied more than he let’s on” is a problem when you are saying you didn’t  under oath. Are you really satisfied with a Supreme Court Judge that is willing to bend the truth while under oath? The man is not credible and unworthy of the court. Also based on his record he seems to have gone into every single case with a predetermined outcome to support power over all else. The corporation is always right in his eyes. Nothing about his record shows a shred of impartiality. There are dozens of judges more qualified. Nobody is trying to pull a McConnell and not allow a sitting president to name a justice. People are just saying a lot about this guy comes off as shady (sex assault, gambling, poor financial management etc). The Dems let Gorsuch through without incident. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>99% of the time, the man is intoxicated as well. Many of my dates involved alcohol. I&#39;ve had more than one one-night-stand where she came over to fuck, and we got tipsy first to loosen up. Just because she&#39;s intoxicated doesn&#39;t mean anything. </p>

<p>Have you <strong>ever</strong> kissed a woman without asking her permission? What if SHE leans in to kiss you without asking your permission? Is that assault in your book? </p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m even having this conversation</p>

<p>You have made some of the most grotesque defense of sexual assault after I confronted you with Trumps own words describing how he sexually assaults women. </p>

<p>That is the truth. To hell with your questions, you do nothing more than make degenerate arguments to excuse sexual misconduct. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t even believe someone would ask permission to kiss someone. Which is awfully telling. </p>

<p>When you have to accuse someone of secual assault to defend the president and his words. You&#39;ve lost your morality and there is absolutely no point in ever believing a word typed from your account.</p>

<p>Guaranteed we&#39;ll find you in a thread where a Democrat is accused. And suddenly we will both think sexual assault is bad. </p>

Shit went on for days and she didn&#39;t mention it once.  Then when Republicans were going to set a vote to confirm him, the allegations were made public.  This is a last ditch effort to stop Kavanaugh&#39;s confirmation.  The Democrats have no other option.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I think so. She has no reason to lie, and was very consistent in her story. He claimed the whole thing was a conspiracy by the Democrats, except he stopped short of saying that Dr. Ford herself was part of that conspiracy, which is pretty senseless. Also, he was obviously lying about some stuff, especially his yearbook blurbs (&#39;alumnia&#39; just means we were friends! &#39;ralph club&#39; is because I puke when I eat spicy foods! come on.), and he got weird and defensive when anyone asked him about his drinking, which seems in line with some of what we&#39;ve been hearing about him.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I&#39;d say if you were an adult, though. If you were five I think I would say this:</p>

<p>One of these two people is lying. The woman says the man attacked her, and the man says he did not. But the woman does not seem like a liar, and the man does seem like a very angry person who might attack people. So, I think the man is the liar.</p>
