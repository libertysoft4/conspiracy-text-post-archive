    <div class="md"><p>yeah i think a lot of the declassified CIA programs are hard to accept. for me, it&#39;s the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf">remote-viewing docs</a>. like, there it is in black and white, but it&#39;s still hard for me to believe it&#39;s true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have experienced so many paranormal things in my life so I don&#39;t find that hard to believe (personally). Especially with the fact that those documents were released. Have you looked into astral traveling? It seems far fetched but I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s what the dude in that experiment was doing. Truth indeed is stranger than fiction.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s cool. I&#39;m not sure if experiencing something like that is worse than not experiencing it though. For me personally, I am surprised when people tell me that they haven&#39;t had any paranormal experiences like that. My life would be way different if I didn&#39;t experience things like that. The weird thing is I mostly had witnesses for the weird shit I experienced which makes it even more creepy for me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly it IS a conspiracy within itself. Didn&#39;t they release documentation last year that aliens exist? I definitely find it interesting on what they choose to release to the public. But yeah. You&#39;re talking about the &quot;psychic&quot; who explained what mars looked like, right? It seems like astral travel but at the same time I can&#39;t really trust the documents they decide to put out anyways. It&#39;s a circus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see that declassified CIA document (Mars Exploration) mentioned often.  </p>

<p>Rarely does anyone post the presentation in which that specific remote viewer discusses his credentials and the military experiment as a whole. (2001, 1h22m)  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSrm5EeRnSo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSrm5EeRnSo</a>  </p>

<p>The entire presentation is fascinating, worth a watch. He specifically discusses the Mars viewing <a href="https://youtu.be/RSrm5EeRnSo?t=37m18s">@37:18</a>.  </p>

<p>Great Q&amp;A towards the end also.</p>

Also the opiate crisis where the pharmaceutical company supplied the opiates but then had a drug that came out to slowly ween off the person off said drug.

<p>Man, again....if you&#39;re at this point <em>STILL</em>, you&#39;re in the wrong place.  Like this is seriously ridiculous.  A non believer is telling me that the US wouldn&#39;t shoot its own toe off just to go to war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a huge difference between &#39;believing&#39; something and considering it &#39;proven&#39;. </p>

<p>Personally I am more in the &#39;believing&#39; category regarding 9/11, but this post is not about me!</p>

<p>The people you consider to be the &#39;experts&#39; might be different people that others consider to be &#39;experts&#39;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re the kind of person who needs to hear from the Gov&#39;t implicate themselves </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. There could be many other kinds of proofs and there are several things that need to be proven, f.ex. &#39;Was the US government complicit?&#39; and if so &#39;Who did what and when and how much?&#39;, also was it using demolition or not? </p>

<p>Some people are claiming it was misiles and not planes etc. which sounds ludicrous to me, but they also rely on their own &#39;experts&#39;.</p>

<p>So because the waters are so muddled you can not say anything has been &#39;proven&#39; regarding 9/11. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a bit like the JFK murder. A lot of people bleive it was CIA but this is in no way &#39;proven&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest with you, it&#39;s common sense more than anything</p>

<p>I don&#39;t play ring around the rosie arguing the dozen or so common argument points which you can Google (just Google &quot;Moon Conspiracy Points&quot; and you&#39;ll get a list)</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the Wiki link: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing_conspiracy_theories">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing_conspiracy_theories</a></p>

<p>They include but are not limited to:</p>

<p>&quot;C&quot; on the rock
Waving flag
Reflectors on the moon
Russians would expose
Shadows at different angles
Back lit surfaces
Picture quality
Communication time lag
Van Allen Radiation Belts</p>

<p>I don&#39;t bother arguing these points because either side can be argued and nothing gets accomplished</p>

<p>What I do is take a step back and look at the whole picture</p>

<p>I&#39;d suggest you walk outside and look up at the moon while you&#39;re thinking about it and ask yourself if it seems possible, especially in the 1960&#39;s but even today</p>

<p>Supposedly ... 3 guys strapped themselves to a 7 million pound thrust rocket and took off from earth, got in orbit, circled earth and fired up the afterburners and headed to the moon for a 3 day trip through space</p>

<p>When they got there they got into moon orbit then separated the lander and safely landed on the moon</p>

<p>Jumped out and drove their dune buggy around for a few days, hit some golf balls, planted a flag, took thousands of pictures, etc and then when it was time to go they fired up the lander and took off from the moon</p>

<p>The lunar lander had to get up to speed of 4,000 miles an hour to catch up to the command module (main ship) to dock with it where the astronauts then climbed inside, swung around the moon in orbit again and fired up the engines for the 3 day return trip to earth</p>

<p>When they got close they figured out how to descend through the atmosphere without burning up and landed in the ocean with the help of some parachutes and were found alive and safe</p>

<p>Then remember they supposedly did this 6 times</p>

<p>In a nutshell, that&#39;s my argument ... it just didn&#39;t happen </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t actually answer my question. You are just claiming that those technologies would not have been sufficient.</p>

<p>Just one example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the parts were more so &quot;hammered together&quot; when things were made 50 years ago and less precise versus today</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Hammered together&quot;. What level of technology do you believe existed 50 years ago? Precision engineering has been a thing since the 18th century.</p>

<p>Please name one component that you believe was &quot;hammered together&quot; to specifications not achievable 50 years ago.</p>

<p>Only one please. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s go with battery technology and climate control ... I&#39;ll give you the precision engineering</p>

<p>We are talking about manned flight versus unmanned flight, 2 completely different things</p>

<p>In manned flight, every minute of the day/night a climate/temperature appropriate for human survival must be maintained ... let&#39;s just say somewhere around 72 degrees Fahrenheit</p>

<p>That&#39;s in the capsule on the way up, all the way through space to the moon, separately in the command module (with one astronaut in it) as it orbited the moon and also in the lander (with 2 astronauts in it) as it descended to the moon&#39;s surface and the entire time it was &quot;parked&quot; there and also in the space suits when the astronauts were on the surface of the moon walking around outside of the lander</p>

<p>Then, back up to moon&#39;s orbit, through docking with the CM, all the way back and then through the earth&#39;s atmosphere to land in the ocean</p>

<p>Tying together battery technology with the weight of the batteries versus amount of electricity used/needed and also tying it in with the size weight of the equipment needed to produce heat and cooling in the spacesuits, lunar lander and command module</p>

<p>The temperature range varied more than 400 degrees from more than 200 below zero to more than 200 above zero in the different environments the astronauts were exposed to throughout their 10 day journey</p>

<p>There would have to be 3 completely separate heating/cooling systems and 3 completely separate battery systems to run those 3 systems </p>

<p>One for the command module, one for the lander and one for the spacesuits (one each for the spacesuits actually)</p>

<p>If you put all those things in a big pile on a warehouse floor, just think of the size/weight it would take up</p>

<p>That is just one part of all of this</p>

<p>Then there is the oxygen generators, water generators (I don&#39;t know what they did about water in space but I don&#39;t imagine they literally brought it with them as in &quot;bottled&quot; water), all the electronics and energy to power them, the communication equipment, the dune buggy and power for that, etc, etc</p>

<p>Now, if you are thinking about the size and weight of all that required stuff then think about the actual size of the lander or capsule or orbiter and all of that had to fit in there along with everything else like fuel, rocket engines, food, whatever they did about going to the bathroom, other gear</p>

<p>Just think about all of it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I enjoy reading about the conspiracy theories, so it was not time wasted but rather time spent</p>

<p>After about 10 hours, almost all of it repeats</p>

<p>90% of the available information can be absorbed in less than 20 hours</p>

<p>After that, it;s only occasionally that something new is uncovered</p>

<p>Anyone spending 10-20 hours looking into it will have enough information to form an opinion</p>

<p>One thing that&#39;s different about the moon landing conspiracy is that it doesn&#39;t matter what you think going into the research, you will come out the other side knowing it didn&#39;t happen</p>

<p>I was a moon landing believer when I started reading and watching videos, I am a moon landing denier now that I&#39;ve taken time to educate myself </p>

The attack, carried out on the ground and by air, destroyed more than 35 blocks of the district, at the time the wealthiest black community in the nation. More than 800 people were admitted to hospitals and more than 6,000 black residents were arrested and detained, many for several days.

<li>&quot;Reproducibility in science is not very sexy. Because our scientific culture generally rewards innovation over cautiousness, replicating a study conducted by others will not get a researcher a publication in a high-end journal, a splashy headline in a newspaper, or a large funding grant from the government. Only an estimated [0.15% of all published results are direct replications of previous studies.](<a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/reproduce-or-bust">http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/reproduce-or-bust</a></li>

    <div class="md"><p>The war on drugs is a war on people and has caused only harm. It was set in place to have more control over people and disrupt political movements and yes jail who they want.</p>

<p>I personally believe that it was mostly done because some drugs allow you to think more freely and take a new prespective on things. Your government didn’t like that because they don’t want you to have your own toughts. I am mainly reffering to psychedelics because it is true they can open up your mind and body and connect you to yourself in ways alot people really need these days.</p>

<p>Its getting better everyday, thanks to the internet people now know the real risks and effects of drugs and turns out alcohol is worse then most if not all of them health wise. I am for Decriminalization, legalization and regulation of all drugs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The grandest ever conspiracy is that one to keep humans believing that we are the cream of the crop of life in the Universe.  In order to do that, UFOs must be absolutely denied until the world&#39;s population, not just the &quot;enlightened&quot; few nations in control, must be educated into accepting the simple fact that we ain&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly it IS a conspiracy within itself. Didn&#39;t they release documentation last year that aliens exist? I definitely find it interesting on what they choose to release to the public. But yeah. You&#39;re talking about the &quot;psychic&quot; who explained what mars looked like, right? It seems like astral travel but at the same time I can&#39;t really trust the documents they decide to put out anyways. It&#39;s a circus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah monsanto is definetly not for the greater good of humanity, it was allways profit driven and they went to far. The latest i heard they are now trying to change the soil so only seeds from them will grow, how fucked up is that. And they are also changing their name soon as is common practice in the world of evil corporations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not surprised at all but for some reason I thought they did that awhile ago. Do you know what their name will be? It&#39;s just a dumb idea, to put it in the most basic way, what if one of the seeds weren&#39;t healthy and had genetic mutations? Then spraying all their shit with pesticides. As if insects won&#39;t become immune to chemicals. </p>
