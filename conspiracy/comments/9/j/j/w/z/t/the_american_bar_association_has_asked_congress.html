    <div class="md"><p>A few reasons. First is that if this is allowed to work, then either side will simply use it on any nomination. You can find someone to make a false accusations against anyone if no proof is required. Basically, no nominee on either side will ever get through.</p>

<p>Next, is Democrats don&#39;t care at all about abuse or Kavanaugh, they are hoping to take the Senate in the midterms then they won&#39;t let anyone get through. So they want to keep this on hold until after the midterms.</p>

<p>Bottom line is the Democrats are acting unhinged. The president gets to choose supreme court justices, it&#39;s just that simple. Kavanaugh isn&#39;t some insane radical, he&#39;s a pretty run of the mill conservative judge as far as his beliefs. There is no reason for the Democrats to acting as though he&#39;s the devil.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a lottery, if your party is in power when a court justice steps down, your side gets the pick. That&#39;s how it&#39;s always been, but suddenly Democrats think this is some new thing.</p>

<p>Now whether or not you like Kavanaugh is a different matter, but nominating him is very standard politics. There should be no issues with him, he passes all the tests.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not defending anything, but there is a system in place. If the President&#39;s party control the Senate, they get to put the justice of their choice in there.

<p>If I thought Dems invented these allegations out of whole cloth, I&#39;d agree with that.  However, what I think happened here was that the Dems used a genuine accusation and weaponized it for maximum political damage, so I don&#39;t agree that what they did was as partisan and skeezy, or as precedent setting as what Republicans did to Garland.  That&#39;s just normal politics.  Republicans have no qualms about using any and every sexual impropriety allegation to maximum political benefit.  <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/09/27/bill-clinton-rape-accuser-juanita-broaddrick-slams-dems-for-biggest-double-standard-on-kavanaugh.html">Sheeiiittt, they were still rolling out Juanita Broaddrick yesterday.</a>.</p>

<p>The Dem base are sick and tired of getting shit on by Republicans&#39; dirty tricks, and though I get into arguments all the time with fellow lefties about the need to keep our tactics as pure as possible, it&#39;s becoming increasingly the minority side of the argument.

<p>Your team already stooped that low. I take it that it didn&#39;t bother you much, as you&#39;re still on &quot;that team.&quot;</p>

Since these are all apparently phoney, there should be no problem disproving them and clearing Kavanaugh&#39;s name.

<p>Who is the one who is closing their eyes to reality? You&#39;ve even admitted that you realize Kavanaugh lied, but still you refuse to see why he should be investigated. You&#39;re still believing the lies that this is all a smear campaign.</p>

<p>Seriously, stop and think about it, there are 4 scenarios/outcomes here.</p>

<p>1) The women are lying and there is an investigation: They are found to be lying, they are arrested, and Kavanaugh gets his name cleared and a seat on the SC.</p>

<p>2) The women are lying but there is no investigation: Kavanugh is pushed through to the court, but a permanent cloud hangs over his reputation because of the unanswered questions and the women can make millions in book deals.</p>

<p>3) Kavanaugh is lying and there is an investigation: The truth is found and he is impeached from his current seat and the women get closure.</p>

<p>4) Kavanaugh is lying but there is no investigation: Kavanaugh gets pushed through to the court and the women have ruined their lives all for naught.</p>

<p>Of those 4, when there is an investigation the liars lose. When their isn&#39;t, the liars win. So why is it Kavanaugh doesn&#39;t want an investigation?</p>

<p>I feel oppressed?  No, but i&#39;ve been watching the last 2 years unfold with unverified allegation after unverified allegation that&#39;s greatly impacted the Trump administration and prevented the rightful transition of power.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry you feel the need to get so defensive instead of considering reality.  You should buckle up because there&#39;s 6 more years of reality coming your way before we see how much worse we can do than trump/hillary.</p>

<p>People levy so many false accusations against Trump that it&#39;s hard to take any of them seriously</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>They&#39;re not.  It would set a dangerous precedent to allow unprovable allegations from a person&#39;s childhood to derail their lives 36 years after the fact.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The idea of an FBI investigation is absolutely rediculous.  Senator Feinstein said as much in her opening statement today when she stated that nothign would have come of them submitting to the FBI... And so somebody leaked the allegations to media to let the outrage machine decide.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>No.. That&#39;s not how things work.  If you have daughters, they should be properly educated to go to the authorities in the event somebody assaults them.  </p>

<p>Why the fuck should they go to the authorities? So a crew of men can hire a prosecutor to tell her shes full of shit in front of everybody else? </p>

<p>There&#39;s no confusion here.  The relevant facts are known.  The democrats did this.  The democrats leaked it to the press because they knew that they couldn&#39;t just let it go to the fbi... so they leaked it to get people worked into a frenzy in hopes they could delay the confirmtaion.</p>

<p>Even Trump has buckled and gone along with this 1 week FBI investigation.  Who knows how many other people they can find in the coming week to pile on with more fake accusations and further alienate actual victims.</p>
