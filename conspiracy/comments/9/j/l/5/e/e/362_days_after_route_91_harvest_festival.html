        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here we are, a year later. Do you know anymore about that fateful evening on 10/1/2017 in Las Vegas now, than you did on 11/1/2017?</p>

<p>This was my red pill.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve stood by as live recordings of the event have been deleted off of sites like YouTube, Reddit and Google. I&#39;ve watched press
conferences of a sheriff so white in the face that I was worried he had the flu.</p>

<p>A young man that was supposedly in the crossfire of a crazed lone gunman has gone from being a hero, to a figment of my
imagination. I&#39;ve seen the videos of the man identified as the gunman loading multiple trolleys of luggage, taking them up an elevator. I&#39;ve read the reports of that man&#39;s brother being charged for CP and then being subsequently released. I also remember the uprising in Saudi Arabia that took place shortly after. But as it always seems to happen, we&#39;ve been left in a dark silence.</p>

<p>Where/who is Marylou Danley?</p>

<p>Where/who is Jesus Campos?</p>

<p>Why did we have one interview with &quot;Campos&quot; on Ellen, and not the handful of others that were announced? Moments before he was to be on stage with Hannity, he ducked out. Never to be mentioned widely in the press again.</p>

<p>Does anyone else question the pictures of Campos at the awards ceremony with a bandage on his face and a cane against his appearance on Ellen?</p>

<p>Was there really a woman that went apeshit in the crowded audience screaming of eminent danger?</p>

<p>Were all of the guns found in the hotel room registered to Paddock?</p>

<p>What about the reports from witnesses who heard gunshots and saw gunmen in other hotels/casinos?</p>

<p>I was naive to think we would get a reasonable explanation as to how &amp; why these events transpired. I&#39;ve been left with a void that
I can&#39;t fill; a continued thirst for the truth. I&#39;ve been fortunate enough to see the recent advances in the D.B. Cooper mystery, but even that has led me down another rabbit hole. 
As it often happens, the further I dig, the more questions I have. </p>

<p>So here I sit with the questions that have further contributed to the foundation of my distrust of the establishment. Everyone in this community wants to know who was really behind the death of the Kennedy boys &amp; MLK. Did we go to the moon? What&#39;s going on under the ice of Antarctica? What morbid secrets does the vatican hold? How far have projects like MKUltra advanced? Was Kubrik just ahead of his time? Who are the puppeteers behind the curtains? We&#39;re left with only more questions.</p>

<p>The only truth that I have learned is that you have to continue to question the things that don&#39;t seem right. Keep asking those questions to yourselves and others. Hopefully someday we&#39;ll be treated to the truth behind it all or at least wake up enough to see this reality for what it really is. A game with limited power players. Until then, I hope we can all find peace.</p>

<p>Your questions are good. You may never get the answers. It seems very clear by now that some kind of cover up of something and or/somebody has been going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>AR-15s can’t shoot as fast as they sound on the videos. A bump stock uses the recoil’s return force to basically push the trigger back against your finger. It does NOT make the gun shoot faster or in anyway similar to a full auto as heard on the videos. Anyone familiar with these firearms knows this and anyone that has ever shot a rifle with a bump stock knows this. These rifles can only shoot as fast as you can pull he trigger, bump stock or not. This was my red pill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a video posted to twitter the night of the shooting. It was taken on the sidewalk just to the side of the hotel. In the video you can hear <strong>plain as day</strong> two different guns being fired. They fire both separately and simultaneously. This was not an echo, this was two distinct &quot;cracks&quot; from two separate weapons. The woman taking the video acknowledges that there were two shooters. The man standing next to her acknowledged that there were two shooters. The dozens of other people on the sidewalk and in the street could be heard talking about two shooters. The woman&#39;s account is long gone and I can&#39;t find the video anywhere. Did anyone else see that video?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not sure I’ve seen the exact video you’re talking about, but I did later see an analysis video done by an acoustics engineer (or similar audio professional) going through most videos available at the time. The completely independent simultaneous rhythms of the various flurries of shots were irrefutably demonstrated to be from separate sources, presumably different guns at different locations. </p>

<p>I can’t find the exact video I saw at that time (early 2018), but this one goes into some detail, albeit not as scientific as the one I mentioned before. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a Las Vegas local for over 10 years now.  I moved here at 25, let me tell you how much of a little city this place is.  The fact that Jesus Campos has basically disappeared makes no sense what so ever.  That man had the golden ticket to the city.  Free drinks and meals, concerts, hockey games, anything he wants, he &quot;stopped the shooter&quot; and he&#39;s nowhere to be found.  Strange.  </p>

<p>The sherif Joe Lombardo was completely obvious as well, which you mentioned.  The first night press conference you could see the compassion and empathy pouring from him.  The next day standing with that shady FBI guy, he looked like he was wearing a butt plug.  Nervous, agitated, and almost scared. </p>

<p>What&#39;s a promotional model? When was her identity verified in Google so it would be presented that way? Definitely isn&#39;t the most noteworthy thing about her anymore.</p>

I’ve read so many different theories and none of them provide solidity but I think Paddock was involved in the dealing or trying of firearms with....?? But someone else in power learned about the transaction about to go down and drama happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A friend of mine lives in Vegas. She said the community was STUNNED. Not only by what happened at the festival. But also by all of the shootings that occurred all over the rest of the city and casinos on that night. The city became straight chaos on that evening. It was never mentioned. Obviously all assets would have been sent to the festival opening holes for criminals in the city to cause chaos. But none of this ever saw the light of day....</p>

<p>There are multiple helicopters all over the place and then of course the eyewitnesses who plain as day said the shooting was coming from helicopters.</p>

<p>Then you have a gun fight at the airport next door. Thats confirmed via the control tower recordings. &quot;we have shooters on the runway&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is video (about 75% certainty) of a 2nd shooter dressed in black on top of the large semi trucks that were lined up inside the festival.  You can see him getting up and moving to a new position. </p>

<p>If you listen to the police scanners, there is reports of shooters in multiple hotels (hooters, NY NY, Belagio, etc) and on the runway as someone else mentioned.  They even mentioned they detained one of the shooters and he confessed to &quot;being involved&quot; in the attack.  Of course there is no mention of him being detained anywhere else.  The police scanner audio is extremely interesting.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember waking up that morning having work off that day and seeing the first reports of the shooting. I had fortunately (or unfortunately) already been red pilled years before from 9-11 so I knew immediately we had been attacked by our own again. It’s disgusting. And to have your eyes opened to it you can never get them closed again. You see the smoke and mirrors everywhere. The world is quite literally a stage. RIP to those who died that day and my heart goes out to their families. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was the scariest, most obviously corrupt, craziest event I&#39;ve ever seen.  I remember obsessing over this tragic event.  Someone on a popular politics forum had posted a warning message, literally at 12:59:59 Sept 10th (which is a message in of itself - 1 second before Sept 11th), warning people to stay away from large events in Vegas over the next few weeks.  They seemed/claimed to be involved, and later mentioned the motive of the shooting (if everything worked as planned) was to garner so much public fear that we would start implementing metal detectors literally everywhere - schools, concert venues, you name it. </p>

<p>There was two companies that I can&#39;t remember the name, both owned by Vegas hotel owners I think, who were going to merge into one super security company (or something along these lines) years down the road, who planned to manufacture all the metal detectors and make millions/billions in stock profit from government contracts and such. Everything they explained made total sense.  </p>

<p>Just makes you wonder about what really goes on in this world that nobody hears about. I don&#39;t trust our lying government for shit, and if you watch the Vegas presser - the FBIs are essentially forcing Lombardo to lie in front of the camera, and it&#39;s pretty obvious that everyone there is extremely uncomfortable with the entire conference.  The whole Jesus Campos interview on Ellen was a complete joke.  They weren&#39;t even the same guys (the real Jesus Campos looks completely different). </p>

<p>Just ugh.  Slimey, slimey fucks in the FBI and CIA.  Aaron Rouse was the name of the agent who head up the  Vegas coverup.  I&#39;m sure he got a gold star.  Thumbs up, Aaron!  Hope you&#39;re reading this you sick fuck. </p>
