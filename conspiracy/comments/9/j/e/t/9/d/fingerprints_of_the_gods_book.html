    <div class="md"><p>he&#39;s challenged popular belief with his own theory, that theory may have changed over time but what he presents now does hold some merit that&#39;s why he is attacked personally what other theory is out there other than the &quot;official&quot; narrative and now piles of evidence has been found to challenge this.  </p>

<p>He is trying to find a theory that works with the evidence that has been found the dogma you speak of is the official narative and the scientific comunity unwilling to reexamine anything because their carrers were built on what at the time may have seemed logical but no longer works. They are the ones that have turned what should be science into a ridgid structured unchangeable timeline akin now to a religion.  And to call Hancock&#39;s backers as sycophants is a joke.   If what Hancock said didn&#39;t work with the evidence at all, he wouldn&#39;t have very many supporters.</p>

<p>Everything you have leveled against Hancock is what is wrong with main stream &quot;science&quot; and its treating theory as fact.</p>

<p>Hancock doesn&#39;t even go that far. He says there&#39;s some significant evidence there was an ancient, now-collapsed, advanced, and global civilization. Beyond that limited claim says there&#39;s a chance there was a civilization as advanced or more advanced than us in some specific but limited ways (like spiritually for example).</p>

<p>He definitely never uses the word proof, or even insinuates that there&#39;s proof, with regard to an ancient civilization being more advanced than us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read the book and loved it. Have you read 1421, the Year China Discovered America, by Gavin Menzies? They are very similar in some of the evidence they refer to, but the latter comes to the conclusion that the Chinese explored the globe before western civilization. He even references Graham in the book. I  not sure which one I believe more. They are both persuasive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have read it thouroughly. </p>

<p>It influenced me to become an independent researcher myself. </p>

<p>I found it to be a very useful book. But, Like Michael Cremo&#39;s Forbidden Archaeology, it&#39;s full of scientific errors and the only thing it is useful for truly now, is the fact that it contains studies and stats no longer easily available to the public. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have not read, but am familiar with Graham Hancock and his work. I find it to be highly believable and the fact that mainstream is so against it makes me think it should be looked at. Anything the mainstream pushes against deserves and need to be researched. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m reading it right now and it&#39;s blowing my mind every time I pick it up. Probably over halfway and it&#39;s a little slow going just because there&#39;s so much information to digest. The precision of the pyramids and the water erosion of the Sphinx are incredibly interesting. As well as the similarities in the origin stories from civilizations around the world. Highly recommend and I can&#39;t wait to read the sequel. </p>
