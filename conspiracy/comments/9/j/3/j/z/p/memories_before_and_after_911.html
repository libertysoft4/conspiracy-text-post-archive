        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was living in the Boston area, and I traveled frequently by plane. Cell phones never worked from inside the plane. Never. They couldn&#39;t bounce the signal from tower-to-tower fast enough. We had to use those phones in the back of the seats.</p>

<p>I was supposed to fly to Colorado to learn how to drive race cars on 9-17. I had won this trip as part of a contest put on by a tobacco company and it got postponed by six months because of the terrorists. I watched the whole fucking thing happen live on TV with my neighbor, an injured professional baseball player. I remember everything the way it happened, that is to say the way it was shown to us, and I remember the events surrounding the attack. The world was different prior to 9-11 in ways that I can&#39;t even describe. After all, it&#39;s impossible to see something that&#39;s lost.</p>

<p>My mother called me after the first crash just to make sure I wasn&#39;t on the plane. I could tell by the size of the hole, it must have been an airliner. The first news reports were sketchy, but nobody just assumed it was an accident, except me apparently. They were all very vague at first, and then they all started telling the same story. My neighbor and I (apartments) were right next door and we would change channels frequently hoping to a get a bigger picture of what happened. There wasn&#39;t a conspiracy market per se at the time, but I had noticed chemtrails in the sky two years earlier, so I already figured the world was fucked before 9-11. </p>

<p>I had watched a documentary about the twin towers a few years earlier, and that&#39;s mainly what I was thinking about that morning. Well, for a few minutes anyway. I was telling my neighbor about it - how they were designed specifically to remain standing after being struck head-on by a fully fuel-laden airliner. I forget which model the designer said he used for spec&#39;s, but it was the biggest boat in the air at the time, and aircraft have not changed significantly since the towers were built. I was literally talking about this when the towers turned into dust. I was blown the fuck away.</p>

<p>Not so much because of what I was seeing, after all, anything&#39;s possible, but because I figured professional designers and architects and demolition teams would know something exotic was going on, but nobody ever said shit. At least not anybody really credible. That doesn&#39;t mean nobody spoke out, it just means we didn&#39;t hear them because of the MSM. Judy Wood has tried, but she may have been tampered with.</p>

<p>Then it was the pentagon, then it was the crater with no debris around it in PA. I had seen news clips about aircraft crashes before, I didn&#39;t just fall off a fucking turnip truck, you know, and these guys were showing me a crater in a field with absolutely no aircraft-style debris around it. Then they started talking about a missile shooting that one down - an American missile. WTF? If that was known to be true, they certainly wouldn&#39;t be showing it on CNN.</p>

<p>The US Air Force has fighter jets that fly at multiples of the speed of sound. They can kill targets hundreds of miles away. I could not believe the lack of military response to 9-11. There were no helicopters, no jets - nothing. They flew jets over Marthas Vinyard when president Bush came to visit, but in the time it took them to respond to 9-11, I could have driven there by car.</p>

<p>They found Mohammad Atta&#39;s car at Logan airport well before noon, but they never showed us the footage of him boarding the plane. They found his Koran in the trunk. TPTB had his name within minutes all over the news. They had 18 other names within a few hours. The whole thing stunk to high heaven, and I was particularly interested because my business involved dealing with Muslims in the Boston area. It just happened to be an industry that attracted immigrant business owners. I believe I made around 400 store visits in my career prior to 9-11, and most of the owners were from the middle east. As a group they were the nicest fucking people I had ever met.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve met European ethnic groups and Asian groups, too. This is just my casual observation of the effects of 9-11. The friendliest people on the planet became feared, even though we didn&#39;t know shit about them. The actor James Woods brought down a passenger plane when he complained to the pilots he was scared of the lady with the shawl over her face. Movies like Hidalgo came out just to warn us about the &#39;bad arabs&#39;. It was only a few years since The Matrix came out, and I felt like it was being woven right over my own eyes. </p>

<p>Sometime that afternoon a reporter in the street was holding up little piece of paper that was singed around the edges, but still shaped like a square. They said it was the passport of one of the hijackers. I said you&#39;ve got to be kidding. You&#39;ve shown us a fireball explosion over and over again throughout the day, now you want us to believe this little piece of evidence survived? Gently floating down into the lap of someone who gives a shit? Ok. Then answer this innocent little question:</p>

<p>In the midst of a biblical catastrophe, who the fuck picks up and reads a little piece of paper? Wouldn&#39;t you assume all the debris was from inside the towers, anyway?</p>

<p>There&#39;s no way to explain what happened on 9-11. The actors and technicians involved probably didn&#39;t even know what was going to happen until it was all over. They just knew they&#39;d be taken care of afterward. The guys flying the chemtrail planes probably don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing, either. Of course, that doesn&#39;t stop them from doing it. The relatively unknown news anchors who just happened to be on that morning remained with us throughout the day, and they all went on to have big, illustrious careers. The guy who owned or leased or insured the twin towers made a billion dollars. Millions more were made by the falling of aircraft stock values, an event which ought to be entirely traceable. Billions were made by the creation of the TSA, and billions more were paid to companies like Blackwater (they change their name every few years). </p>

<p>Then it was the hunt for Bin Laden, which involved the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was all a big joke - TPTB claiming they can&#39;t find this guy and the only picture they have is blurry and shows none of his features. Translation: You want me to find him? Fuck you, pay me. I&#39;ve read that the Taliban built schools and outlawed the growing of opium before America set them straight. </p>

<p>Soon it was anthrax in the mail and reports of a DC sniper that nobody&#39;s ever seen. What would induce a reporter to use the word &#39;sniper&#39;? Traditionally, that word describes methods and technology, and we didn&#39;t know any of that, supposedly. Some guys falls dead while pumping gas into his car and they start throwing the word sniper around, and you know how it ended? When law enforcement &#39;agreed&#39; to the snipers so-called request to say a few words over the radio. Just a few, very specific words that relate to an obscure Native American fable were aired and the snipers fell asleep in their vehicle. Soon after that they were taken into custody, although they had already been in custody while the hunt was still ongoing. Welcome to the Patriot Act.</p>

<p>They killed war reporter Daniel Pearl buy cutting off his head, supposedly live on the internet. They mailed anthrax to some of &#39;the best investigative reporters in the world&#39;. They made sure they story they were telling is the only story out there. Everyone with any sense of self-preservation toes the line. There was a breach created between official news and real news. Now we have a whole media section called &#39;conspiracy&#39; and it&#39;s entirely full of shit, too. We know there&#39;s a secret government of sorts. We know that people who don&#39;t have any obvious connections make secret deals to their own benefit. And we know that it all runs on money. </p>

<p>In the last Star Trek movie, Kirk flips the Enterprise over in an act of desperation after it crashed and he was in a fight, remember? Now, imagine we&#39;re observing this from the outside - the way we are with the twin towers. You see this gigantic thing happen, and you ask yourself why. This is a great big thing we&#39;ve witnessed, surely there must have been some great big purpose behind it. The truth isn&#39;t so exotic.</p>

<p>The truth is that this great big thing occurred just to give one little man a momentary advantage over another. Apply this maxim to every question we have about mysterious events, and it provides a suitable answer - an answer we can believe and hopefully all agree on. </p>

<p>Now, go to sleep. You&#39;ve been caught like a duck in a noose.</p>

I didn&#39;t mean to hurt your feelings and I didn&#39;t down-vote you. I actually don&#39;t pay attention to that because I&#39;m not working for Internet points. My feeling in your comment is that even if that person is legit, it doesn&#39;t matter. It doesn&#39;t matter to the dead and it won&#39;t help us understand what we need to take away from 9-11. I knew from experience the phones didn&#39;t work over the northeast. It doesn&#39;t matter what CIA says. I know because I was there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, you&#39;re still supporting statements made by the CIA? Or their whatever - supposedly former employee?  This is called a slippery-slope, sweetie - aka - a trap. Best not to go there.</p>

<p>9-11 isn&#39;t a source of entertainment for me, and I&#39;m not accusing anyone or suggesting any kind of theory to argue over. We can&#39;t possibly expect to ever find out what really happened on that day. All we can do is remember and that&#39;s the purpose of this post - to remember what happened on 9-11.  </p>

<p>Comments from the CIA&#39;s peanut gallery are not welcome here. If you persist in supported them, I&#39;ll take whatever action I can to have your comments removed from this thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. This seems like a good idea, but it just seems that way.</p>

<p>Books like this are responsible for the popular belief that chemtrails are going to save the world from the scourge of humanity. TPTB have never made such a claim, and yet it&#39;s part of the &#39;conspiracy landscape&#39; that people so willingly believe. This trope is even in the movie Snowpiercer - where chemtrails worked so well against global warming that the world froze over. Sorry, but I&#39;m calling bullshit.</p>

<p>The question of what they&#39;re spraying or even why they&#39;re spraying could be answered truthfully by only a very few people. The pilots don&#39;t need to know, and neither does the ground crew. Air traffic controllers can&#39;t even see the planes, so they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re dropping, either.</p>

<p>If you could somehow grab the responsible parties by the throat and demand the truth - they&#39;d probably say they were just trying to combat global warming. But since this theory has become so popular - we might think we don&#39;t even need to grab anybody by the throat - because we already &#39;know&#39; what&#39;s going on. </p>

<p>Reading is not knowing. Neither is learning nor hearing nor thinking. Believing is the most dangerous substitute for knowing that there is. Cause and effect are observable. We need only open our eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s just so fucking sickening how <em>easily</em> they got away with it. </p>

<p>It’s disgusting what they did ofc, but it’s like it’s what I’ve come to expect from the government at this point, to kill its own people and preform false flags in the name of Israeli agenda. </p>

<p>But what I find truly awful is how easy it was to fake, and how obvious it was it was fake and how hard it is for the American people to believe it was fake. This, the same population who called out the Kardashians for their fakeness. sure hey can see through that, and they can see through how fake trump is, and cry foul everytime he makes a mistake.(not that he doesn’t deserve to be called out ofc) </p>

<p>but yet they can’t wrap their heads around the fact that a bunch of cave dwelling, box cutter wielding saudis weren’t able to hijack planes, fly them at speeds not possible in maneuvers skilled pilots couldn’t do, <strong>and</strong> disintegrate all relevant evidence on impact. The fact they didn’t even demand a fucking <strong>trial</strong> for their fallen fellow citizens, but were instead convinced by the media to go to war, after admonishing previous administrations for Vietnam and demanding peace, were so quick to listen to their leaders telling them to demand justice with missiles, instead of listening to the <strong>founding fathers</strong> who would tell them to <em>demand</em> justice with trial and jury shows us just how fucking doomed we are. </p>

<p>It’s grotesque how easily they’ve manipulated us and it saddens me how low my fellow citizens have sunken, and continue to sink. </p>

<p>Including myself, as I and us all are just as susceptible to their sneaky propaganda, we conspiracy theorists just do what they don’t want us to do and think outside the box they gave us and use our heads. </p>

<p>Logic over emotion folks, that will never fail you. Think with your head and lead with your heart. I hope the masses wake up soon.  </p>

Surely someone involved in this deception would eventually, for whatever reason, leak some information. Something would have to slip through the cracks...

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>It’s disturbing but true how gullible the public is</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;re actually not. The public is made of individuals, and we&#39;re the best fucking thing this planet has to offer. Most intelligent. Most empathetic. Most powerful. Most creative. When we gather together under a flag or an idea, we act like we&#39;ve been possessed by something else entirely.</p>

<p>Our problem is we create too much. There are things we&#39;ve come to accept as a part of our everyday lives that were created by another person. That should be a terrifying thought because unless you made it yourself - every tool from a socket wrench to AI is really a weapon in disguise. </p>

<p>What I mean by that is - the inventor of every tool created it just to give himself an advantage - to make money. (only the Fed can actually make money. You and I have to hustle it away from each other, while telling ourselves we&#39;re making it). This is why Hollywood makes so many man vs machine movies, only they leave out the money part, because the movie itself is a machine that has to &#39;make&#39; money, too. And they never expand the concept of a machine to intangible subjects like ideas.</p>

<p>Occasionally,  we might fashion a tool from scratch in order to gain advantage over a stuck bottle cap or hard-to-reach item. Only in those situations does the tool/weapon exist to serve you or me. Any tool that I purchase was not created to serve me. It was created to take advantage of me. It was created to &#39;make&#39; money off me.</p>

<p>You might be thinking wtf right now, but this is honestly the answer to everything. The public is indeed gullible. We&#39;ll eat anything, whether it was manufactured by nature or not. We&#39;ll believe anything, as long as it comes to us through the proper channels, and we&#39;ll do anything - as long as the first two criteria have been met. If you try to behave outside this pattern, you get pushed outside of society, and that&#39;s OK. Its exactly what we need, because society is sick.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to introduce a new idea precisely because people are not really that gullible. Those who believe the official 9-11 story are people who don&#39;t want to be fooled, so they&#39;ll only consider info that comes to them through the proper channels. This is a nice, safe way to live. At least, you feel safe - and you can&#39;t be faulted for wanting to feel safe. I wish I could limit my understanding to just whatever comes through the proper channels, but it&#39;s too late for that. I guess we&#39;re only as gullible as we want to be, or allow ourselves to be, and that&#39;s ok, too because where 9-11 is concerned the truth is fucking scary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You kinda contradicted yourself but I get your general point, I agree with the tool idea that everything we do and make is really a hustle in disguise, everyone is constantly on the move to reach their final stage and will get there by any means necessary, that’s society in the simplest definition. </p>

<p>I do stand to be wrong and exaggerating a little bit cuz what is it like 40% of the US population don’t believe 9/11 and the numbers are high internationally. I just don’t run into these people very often lol so it’s easy for me to become biased in that sense, but the problem is people don’t believe the story but they also don’t want to believe Israel had a part in it, which makes the numbers go down a lot more but that’s ok, we still got them on our side as long as they’re questioning our government that’s great one more for the team! </p>

<p>Really the biggest enemy is the bank cabal and the religious sects and it has been that way since man first started using tools to hustle them out of their tools to use your words, and that’s what we have to watch out for. The more people I hear questioning our system, and I hear more and more everyday, the resistance is growing, the more confident I am in a better future. Now, people are waking up, albeit slowly, and that gives TPTB ample time to play catch up and snare us at our own game, but I like what you said when you stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When we gather together under a flag or an idea, we act like we&#39;ve been possessed by something else entirely</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is so true, people go absolutely fucking ballistic when it comes to defending their identity, if you want one way to lose a fight, it is to attack someone’s identity because they will fight to the fucking <strong>DEATH</strong> to preserve that, and shit who could blame us I would too as well as I’m sure you would. So while I have been known to post a lot of doom and gloom scenarios on here, that’s just because I want people to wake up and sometimes, although shitty, the best way to do it can be through fear, especially if it threatens their routines and ability to reach their final stage, which is why I sometimes post such doomsday breakaway scenarios, but I do really have hope in my heart that we as a collective rise up and can overcome the greater evil that lies above. </p>

<p>Youve given me a lot to think about and I think you’re a very intelligent individual. </p>

I guarantee you if someone presented Jimmy (or anybody) with a truth so powerful that it could actually change the way things are in the world, because it literally changed the people exposed to it, it would get watered down or outright rejected by even sweet little Jimmy as soon as he realized he was going to loose his channel as people started waking up and ignoring their devices. I don&#39;t mean to pick on Jimmy, it&#39;s just I see a pattern here, one which I plan to highlight in an upcoming post.

    <div class="md"><p>I was 14 when 9/11 happened. I remember going into class and everyone was acting strange and I asked my classmate what happened, and she said &quot;America is under attack from terrorists.&quot; And I remember this deep, gut feeling and I instantly thought &quot;no, thats not right.&quot; It wasn&#39;t denial or confusion or fear, it was pure intuition telling me right then and there that a VERY BIG LIE was happening. It was the first time I ever felt something like that so strongly. In the weeks following 9/11, I started seeing stuff online about controlled demolitions and the weirdness around WTC7 and all that. And I really believed it for a minute, until I started reading the shilly, debunking comments and I started to feel really dumb and naive for even considering that they might be controlled demos. After all, I was just 14. Eventually I said to myself &quot;if it is really true that they were demolished, wouldn&#39;t it be on the news? Wouldn&#39;t everyone be talking about it?&quot; And so I rejected the idea, and eventually settled on &quot;higher ups in the government/military must have known it was going to happen, and they let it happen so they could roll out the PATRIOT act.&quot; I was on the right track, but I just pushed the idea that it was planned and executed by insiders out of my head. It took another 15 years before I decided to take a hard look at 9/11 (thanks to the New Pearl Harbor doc).</p>

<p>I keep coming back to that first moment when I heard of the &quot;terrorist attack&quot; and <em>knowing</em> it wasn&#39;t true. That was the day I rejected my inner voice, my intuition...all because a couple of shills on the internet made me feel dumb. I can&#39;t help but wonder how many other people learned to ignore their gut that day, and if that was even part of the plan all along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good for you, man. It takes a ton of courage to think for yourself. In the weeks following the event, we all started thinking about how to protect ourselves from another attack. When I say, &#39;we&#39; - I mean these thoughts occurred to me organically, which is the scariest fucking part of the whole thing:</p>

<p>&quot;The power of the individual makes us all vulnerable&quot; - laptops and cellphones provided me with pretty much the same tools available to large corporations. If there were bad guys out there - they could use that tech against us. I don&#39;t want to give up my tech, but I don&#39;t want the terrorists to cut my head off, either. What do we do? What do we do?</p>

<p>Answer: Patriot Act. Intrusive surveillance. No Fly Lists. In 2002 I was skeptical that &#39;the machine&#39; would be able to harness enough brain power to keep tabs on everyone, all the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good for you, man. It takes a ton of courage to think for yourself. In the weeks following the event, we all started thinking about how to protect ourselves from another attack. When I say, &#39;we&#39; - I mean these thoughts occurred to me organically, which is the scariest fucking part of the whole thing:</p>

<p>&quot;The power of the individual makes us all vulnerable&quot; - laptops and cellphones provided me with pretty much the same tools available to large corporations. If there were bad guys out there - they could use that tech against us. I don&#39;t want to give up my tech, but I don&#39;t want the terrorists to cut my head off, either. What do we do? What do we do?</p>

<p>Answer: Patriot Act. Intrusive surveillance. No Fly Lists. In 2002 I was skeptical that &#39;the machine&#39; would be able to harness enough brain power to keep tabs on everyone, all the time. </p>
