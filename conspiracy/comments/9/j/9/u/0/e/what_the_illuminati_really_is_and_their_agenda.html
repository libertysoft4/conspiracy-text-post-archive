        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-09-27 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/JXLVII.html">JXLVII</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let&#39;s first, get over what the Illuminati is, it isn&#39;t a real group anymore, the real &#39;illuminati&#39; was the bavarian illuminati which ended way back in 1785, founded in 1775 by David Weishaupt, it was a group for enlightenment purposes, but remember, the enlightenment could be for anything, evil or good, such as learning that the Devil is god for example. The eye on the pyramid mostly means mass surveillance AKA &#39;always watching&#39; we know this through web browser collecting and the most famous one, Facebook&#39;s data collecting for surveillance and experiment purposes.</p>

<p>You may or not know of the Freemasons, which are currently running rampant in today&#39;s society secretly with little to no attention, and I&#39;d call them the modern illuminati.</p>

<p>Every city (including yours) has a freemason lodge, and you can google this by typing [Freemason lodge <em>enter your city here</em>) and find it&#39;s location, they regularly shut down and change locations, as they did WORLDWIDE the past few weeks. I&#39;m based here in Australia, and when I heard they were moving lodges over in America, they did it here too, so there&#39;s obviously a connection here between Freemasonry internationally. If you know these people, they participate in rituals and sacrifices which is all proven in multiple documentation regarding them, you can do you&#39;re own research, but be careful of discreditable websites.</p>

<p>Now, freemasons worship Lucifer, it&#39;s no joke and it&#39;s your choice to believe it, obviously they won&#39;t tell you if you&#39;re not involved as it&#39;s a covert group, they want to stay secret, but they believe Lucifer is the god and ruler of this world and is the &#39;lightbearer&#39; hence illuminati, they want the bible out of the picture and want everybody to believe Lucifer is the god and ruler of this current world known as Earth.</p>

<p>This is why the Bible has been and is currently being banned, you can google this aswell, it&#39;s currently happening in the United States as well, where I&#39;d imagine most of you live. They are banning this state-wide and in libraries. If this doesn&#39;t spark that questioning in you yet, then I don&#39;t know what will.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s no surprise that the government/president/politics are involved, as they purely strive for control, they want control over the masses as-well, they do this through any outlet they can get their hands on to advance their agenda for their own benefit, like the Media, Music and covert groups like Freemasonry for example. Don&#39;t believe it? Do some Google Image searching like &quot;Celebrity Freemasons&quot; or &quot;Celebrity Satanic Symbols&quot; If you&#39;d like to argue against this feel free to comment below.</p>

<p>The military is confirmed to have a ratio of 70% freemasons and 30% non freemasons, the 30% containing people that have never heard of Freemasonry, haven&#39;t joined, don&#39;t want to join as-well as having to join due to advancing in ranks. Most soldiers over the rank of a Master Sergeant are mostly Freemasons, they won&#39;t say because it&#39;s obviously a covert criminal group, but that&#39;s how it is, they took an oath and must keep it covert to the public, just like most government officials do, like the police. Not all, but most are.</p>

<p>No one knows their main agenda, but we can research and find their other Miscellaneous agenda(s) such as pushing homosexuality and paedophilia. They are currently doing this heavily through Hip-Hop music, such as a-lot of Satanic symbolism, men wearing womens clothing and straight up homosexual lyrics, this is to feminise men, we don&#39;t know why yet but it&#39;s clear they&#39;re pushing this.</p>

<p>Regarding them pushing paedophilia, they push this through the current historical doctrines known as the Cabal. Kaballists run rampant through the industry today, again, don&#39;t believe it? Do a quick Google search of Celebrity Kaballists and they usually wear a red bracelet indicating they&#39;re apart of the &quot;brotherhood&quot;, as they all take oaths before joining.</p>

<p>[For Religious People], I used to be an athiest, but have come to the conclusion that unfortunately this is a spiritual war, and they want to drag everybody they can down with them before the end, and Satan owns this current place we live on called Earth. This is heavily studied in Freemasonry, and I believe it to be true. It&#39;s proven that satanic rituals and sacrifices are conducted and practices all through out the industry, industry is a heavy word, because that&#39;s where most of them are involved.</p>

<p>more to come, as-well as fixing this post up, there&#39;s too much to talk about and wanted to get it off my chest.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>No, it&#39;s happening in more than schools, they&#39;re pushing to ban it completely. Why aren&#39;t they heavy on Islam? Are you aware of Sharia Law and the bad consequences it comes with? ISIS being funded by the US heavily relying on Islam and pushing it? Way worse than Christianity, yet this is what they&#39;re focusing on. Christianity is bad, but Islam is perfectly fine apparently. Why isn&#39;t Islam being banned in countries where this wasn&#39;t even practised originally? Their God sexualizes animals and kids, even married a kid younger than the age of 13. Which also is relevant to the Cabal which has a-lot of paedophilia involved.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The entire military?!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, but most higher ranks than a Master Sergeant. I have a-lot of ex-military family/friends and have said they&#39;ve seen a-lot of soldiers that practice freemasonry and are involved as-well as reading the books. Some have seen the symbolism on the ERB that other&#39;s receive (Enlisted Record Brief Reports) and you can check real documentation on that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So how do you know?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read above. You can also Google/YouTube real ex-military that have discussed this, you can do the research.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s an interesting question, what makes womens clothing exclusively women? Quite a few cultures wear skirts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not that, but obviously decades ago, wearing womens clothing would label you a homosexual, which is what they&#39;re pushing currently. Ask most old heads, they wouldn&#39;t dare put women&#39;s clothing on, it&#39;s not that it&#39;s exclusive to women, but the homosexual part of wearing womens clothing making you a feminised man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also want to note why you didn&#39;t bring up current artists with all the satanic symbolsim they do in their videos/posts, if you don&#39;t think it&#39;s serious then what do you think it is? Them making a joke? Wow so funny haha so funny I forgot to laugh, oh wow mock rituals and sacrifices in the video, must be a joke huh!

    <div class="md"><p>Why would a group keep quiet about worshipping a deity that they want the whole world to worship?</p>

<p>It would be so easy to push luciferianism through media to make it sound much more attractive than Christianity. How do you think Christians pushed their religion onto pagans? It definitely wasn&#39;t by staying in a private cult. The bible isn&#39;t being banned, dude.</p>

<p>The freemasons are an exclusive group of tradesmen and businesspeople who direct business towards each other. I&#39;ve been in similar groups where you just get together, talk about how your operation is going, talk about how to achieve more business and offer better services to your club members than an average person would get. It&#39;s an arrogant little clique of people who want to feel important. All the symbolism is just tired old tradition.</p>

<p>They probably push the whole conspiracy thing just to sound more mysterious and be taken more seriously by idiots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, it&#39;s the agenda. If you want it to become successful, you have to practice it and do it covertly before releasing it to the public. Just like they test all their technology and make sure it&#39;s public ready to announce.</p>

<p>Remember, they have tonnes of technology that they haven&#39;t announces to us, such as linguistic neural monitoring and such more. It&#39;s only on the internet due to leaks, not announcements from the officials. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The meaning of the eye means &quot;Mass Surveillance.&quot; &quot;</p>

<p>You can&#39;t make statements like that and expect people to keep reading. </p>

<p>In ancient Egypt, the eye symbol was associated with the Eye of Horus or Ra. The Eye of Horus,  within the Egyptian cosmology, symbolized the eye of the person who has achieved enlightenment through various incarnations and has learned the mystery of God. Gnostic studies suggest that Horus is the same as the Holy Spirit of Christianity, Shiva of Hinduism and Sangha of Buddhism.</p>

<p>This is why the Eye of Horus is the symbol of the mystery schools of ancient Egypt, as disciples were taught to transcend the duality of mind and understand contrasts simply as a way to reach the truth. Interconnected with the Eye of Horus symbolism is that of the pyramid. The pyramid is an important symbol in many different cultures. Hindu tradition represented it with a simple triangle and Celtic culture had a cone, but in every tradition the essence of the pyramid is the same: the three attributes of God – will, love &amp; intelligence. The journey of the soul in search of light is represented by a pyramid, the top of it being the final destination. This is why the All-Seeing Eye appears at the top of a pyramid in Freemason symbolism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because it means that back then, doesn&#39;t mean it means the same in our days. Just like the bible, it&#39;s been twisted and manipulated up to this day, if you don&#39;t believe that, well that&#39;s fine you haven&#39;t done the research. Government officials do mass surveillance operations such as COINTELPRO, and the one that brought down the Black Panthers, aswell as the FBI/CIA assassinating one of the public speech members.</p>

<p>They definitely do covert illegal surveillance with their unannounced technology for psychological warfare. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the best advice i gave myself or anyone is take the time to listen or read the illuminatus (yes with the u) 3 book series.<br/>
illuminatus book 1 eye in the pyramid<br/>
illuminatus book 2 the golden apple<br/>
illuminatus book 3 leviathan<br/>

if you have any understanding of the las vegas shooting cover up and bs that surrounds it,  the series of 3 books will have you seeing the games rules a little clearer. the game? yes the game of life we are in with those wanting to keep us where we are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, I&#39;ve listened to those and completely agree. The Vegas shooting was staged, not a false flag like some think, some think that the deaths were fake and the WHOLE thing was staged, no real people died, all for an agenda, THE GUNS. They want the guns taken away from us, which is way they&#39;re planning a way to implement martial law. They want military assistance with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i honestly went into it to see nothing and be done. i never got into the illuminati all like that. i talk to ppl who dont even know the shooters name and i can tell you his bday. i have more about jason aldine williams than some of his most &quot;die hard&quot; fans....so if you have heard the books. go to book 1 and about 10 mins into it they speak of &quot;it being some kind of stage. most not prepared and most poorly coached&quot;. says we been here 4 billion yearts revolving around the sun. calls it a circus. well if you go to jason aldine williams tattoo and flip it over you will be presented with that exact clown show. the black hole sun. now heres the good part...
while you view the tattoo upside down what youll see is on the right wearing the jack of spades as a crown is the king of rock n roll elvis..youll see a profile of him. the dots are his left eye.....wearing the ace of spades as a crown is his son in law the king of pop michael jackson. his face is plastic and melting into the black hole sun. they are butting heads. </p>

<p>if you can see that on the tattoo theres much more to add but ill let you take that in. i have hours and hours of info id love to get out. im just horrible at vids and getting ppl to follow along. im really happy you have taken the time. if interested i have a great connection to jason aldine williams, and his &quot;b.k. and sack of big macs&quot; which ironically is a line in the old rap song JAM ON IT  by newcleus. heres the link for the song if you dont know.....listen for the b.k and sack of big macs. (if i dont have you interested im failing. but if your still here take a listen

<p>the real &#39;illuminati&#39; was the bavarian illuminati which ended way back in 1785, founded in 1775 by David Weishaupt, it was a group for enlightenment purposes, but remember, the enlightenment could be for anything, evil or good, such as learning that the Devil is god for example. The eye on the pyramid mostly means mass surveillance AKA &#39;always watching&#39; we know this through web browser collecting and the most famous one, Facebook&#39;s data collecting for surveillance and experiment purposes.</p>
