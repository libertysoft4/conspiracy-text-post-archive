    <div class="md"><p>What case? I’m talking about multiple issues.  He refused to comment under oath on whether or not water boarding is torture.  On the DC court of appeals he supported indefinite detention of American citizens with little to no evidence.  He signed onto a judgment that blocked wrongfully detained prisoners who were tortured from being able to sue the private contractors that tortured them.  Unfortunately these proceedings haven’t been transparent enough to know just how involved he was in Bush’s overriding of previously in place torture laws but what we do know is he holds the neocon position on illegal detention and torture everywhere he’s on record.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The disappearing people section, you read up on it?</p>

<p>You&#39;d see his stance on it if you did, but what you&#39;re stating is not his stance. So I&#39;m under the assumption you haven&#39;t read it and found your information through news articles released in the last week or on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>In fact, you&#39;ve kinda bastardized his stance on a few issues. It&#39;s a lot easier to destroy a neocon if you just tell the actual truth of their work...or at least it used to when this sub was anti-war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What did Kavanaugh say when asked that? </p>

<p>I quoted that part of the article you sent you silly ass child. You&#39;re making a speculation with your last two sentences without providing evidence he plans to Kickstart Trump&#39;s torture program.</p>

<p>Find me information before this week that discusses his record with the Bush administration. I&#39;ve seen a good chunk thanks to a post I made searching for the information.</p>

<p>You are quoting Trump and attributing it to Kavanaugh, like you see that. Now connect the two with sources that basically state that he is planning to start the program.</p>

<p>Like I said. I will wait, but if you jerk me around again, I won&#39;t stand by and listen to the speculation and fear laden theories of yours.</p>

<p>Was he asked that during the hearing? And was it relevant to the Ford accusation? I&#39;ve quoted it from an article and your article didn&#39;t state it was from the hearing.</p>

<p>Dude I don&#39;t give a shit about Kavanaugh lol, you just haven&#39;t proved any of the claims you&#39;ve set out to prove. You&#39;ve just set up hypotheticals? You have to actually prove shit to prove a conspiracy theory. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t say I&#39;m worked up, I actually don&#39;t care for this conversation. Answer the shit you set out to answer or don&#39;t expect a reply back. I don&#39;t have to spend the time engaging with you lol, I&#39;m just surprised how ignorant you are and like seeing how deep it goes.</p>

I asked you something and stated that I would like more information to which you started asking a hypothetical question about child molestation (to which you assumed I support pizzagater/Trump supporter with that)</p>

<p>You have still refrained from answering or providing evidence to your original claim.</p>

<p>So answer first and then I&#39;ll entertain your silly shit. I&#39;ll answer all your hypothetical questions and moral quandaries, as long as you provide evidence to your original claim like I&#39;ve asked for continually.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Understood.  I am also not a fan of rape.  I am a fan of due process.  If someone accused you or I for raping someone and we did not do it.  How would you like it if everyone just assumed you did it only because  someone said you did it?  Even when accuser&#39;s witness said it didn&#39;t happen.  It wouldn&#39;t be too cool.  Think of what kind of chaos we would have if we took everyone for their word.  Show me a person who has never lied in their life.  Hate the man for who or what he is.  Don&#39;t hate him because someone says you should.  Basically that&#39;s what&#39;s going on here.  That&#39;s just my opinion.  Does not make me right or wrong.  Does not make you right or wrong.

    <div class="md"><p>I can respect your opinion.  I believe most of those women have turned out to be frauds.   This is a tactic the democrats have done on many occasions.  Your right the last nomination didn&#39;t get this treatment.  The last nomination did not put the Supreme Court in favor of the conservatives.  This is a big deal.  These judges hold their positions for a long time. The democrats would be basically stuck if and when he gets approved.  If you think back to Clarence Thomas , the same tactic was used on him and it failed.  Check out Fords 17 go fund me accounts.  This is how people are paid off.  They have been doing it this way for awhile.  Crises actors, etc.  This is how it&#39;s done.  I checked it out last night.  How many people make a donation of 10,000, 5,000 or 1,000.  Sure there are people that do it.  I found the same people making the same large dollar amount  donations several times.  4,5,6 times.  I saw one do it 12 times.  This is in the last 7 days.  Sorry , people in the world just don&#39;t function that way.  They don&#39;t want to take the time unless they are getting something out of it.  1 large donation, sure, 5 large donations in 7 days, waste of time .  Why not do in in one day?  Large amount donations get attention</p>

This is kinda payback for the Democrats because Mitch stalled a supreme court nomination for a whole fuckin year. So we are trying to do the same and hope to take more seats so we can keep stalling. I know its lame but politics is a bitch. Anyway, take care man and good luck to you guys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perjury is definitely the riskiest trap but it starts with a timeline. That was the basis of the R attack and effort to discredit. Ford set the seed to define the date with the Judge encounter at the Safeway? he worked at during a summer. That would zero in on the date of the party and would require witnesses to confirm or deny something more specific, then it’s easier to catch people in lies. Generic dates are easily brushed off with I don’t recall.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct in that is one way to go about it but, that would require more manpower, more time and a witness.  So far Fords witnesses have not helped if not hindered.  I think it would be far easier to hold a mans life in front of him, which they basically do with his documents, minutes from the hearings or any other thousands of documents they have on him and catch him in a lie.  They wouldn&#39;t even have to reserve a parking place.  Remember that all it takes to be a lie is one word.  It could be a simple&quot;me&quot; instead of &quot;we&quot; or something along the lines of when he was being asked if he had talked  to anyone that worked for that law firm.  I don&#39;t recall it&#39;s name.  Anything  trivial can be used.  Far easier to catch a mentally stressed out person than looking for a unknown witness . Respectfully </p>

<p>• Isn’t it a fact that you don’t know where or when this purported assault happened?  </p>

<p>• Isn’t it a fact that you can’t tell us how you got there?   </p>

<p>• You just know the house was several miles from your home, but it is a fact, is it not, that you can’t tell us how you got home?    </p>

<p>• You’ve told us that you were terrified running out of the house after the attack, but you can’t tell us who rescued you and drove you away?  </p>

<p>• You remember 36 years ago that you had exactly one beer at the party, you remember hearing your alleged attackers go downstairs, you remember exactly the route you took to get out of the house, yet you can’t tell us what happened after you left the house?    </p>

<p>• So, you’re sure the party happened, but you can’t say when it happened, you can’t say where it happened, you don’t know how you got there, you don’t know how you got home, and every person you’ve identified as a witness says that they have no memory of the party and that they never saw Brett Kavanaugh act the way you’ve described, isn’t that right?    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He lied when he said Devil’s Triangle is a drinking game for one. Everyone knows it’s a threesome with 2 straight guys and a girl. That’s what it means and has always meant and he lied under oath about it even though he knows everyone knows he’s lying. The sheer fucking elitism and arrogance of it. I genuinely think all the people supporting him must be brainwashed or are being paid because it makes no sense why anyone would want that guy on the Supreme Court, not if you’re not part of the so-called elite. I mean, people just can’t have that little self respect to think someone like that deserves to make important decisions about things that could affect your life and the lives of people you love. The partisan bias stuff has gone way way too far when people are clinging to a vile specimen like this. You all know he’s vile, you all know he’d shove over your Granny if they were both going for the last slice of cake because he’s that entitled, you know he lied under oath, you know he has no actual respect for the law or the American people but you’ll defend him anyway just because he’s on ‘your team’ Grow some integrity for fuck’s sake!</p>

<p>1) The women are lying and there is an investigation: They are found to be lying, they are arrested, and Kavanaugh gets his name cleared and a seat on the SC.</p>

<p>2) The women are lying but there is no investigation: Kavanugh is pushed through to the court, but a permanent cloud hangs over his reputation because of the unanswered questions and the women can make millions in book deals.</p>

<p>3) Kavanaugh is lying and there is an investigation: The truth is found and he is impeached from his current seat and the women get closure.</p>

<p>4) Kavanaugh is lying but there is no investigation: Kavanaugh gets pushed through to the court and the women have ruined their lives all for naught.</p>

<p>Of those 4, when there is an investigation the liars lose. When their isn&#39;t, the liars win. So why is it Kavanaugh doesn&#39;t want an investigation?</p>

<p>However, something Ford said 36 years ago doesn&#39;t amount to anything significant...I can just say shit like that too. Just because I say it doesn&#39;t make it true though and you know that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you think “the truth” of an event over 30 years ago that the alleged victim’s own witnesses have denied knowledge of? The way I see this situation, it’s basically her word against his. Here’s the two options that I could see happen (with results of any possible investigation confirming either way being a near impossibility): a-he gets through and the accusers disappear into ancient memory with the occasional complaint from dems or b-he doesn’t get confirmed and the accusers disappear. Either way, I don’t expect anything to keep coming from accusers after the decision is made. In my view, regardless of either lying, and I say this because of the timing, this is a political move 100% to attempt to influence the mid terms. These accusations are absolutely not about finding justice for the alleged victims. As was said during the hearings, and I really don’t see many people bring this up, in Maryland there is no statute of limitations for felony sexual offenses. Why hasn’t this option been followed?</p>

<p>Welp, Kavanaugh was a nerdy, academic/sports kid that was true to his family traditions and didn&#39;t want to get laid until he was in love, so move on from your fever dream.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But that&#39;s the difference between now and the early 80&#39;s, men and women. </p>

<p>Yeah. I was a sophomore  in highschool when this unsubstantiated party went down. In Ford&#39;s first letter she said &quot;everyone knew about it&quot; and she recanted. You know why? Because people didn&#39;t even talk about this. This was when rape victims got what they deserved because their skirts were too short. She lied that &quot;everyone talked about it&quot;. </p>

<p>Ford had spent decades of her life building her own career/reputation. </p>

<p>Again, her own family and best friends from the DC community didn&#39;t show up to sit behind her. And her career belies her testimony on several key points. She&#39;s either the worst experimental psychologist or a supreme liar.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I imagine that it was purging herself saying she&#39;s never had a conversation about how to beat a polygraph, don&#39;t you?</p>

<p>When do we start getting to diagnose people publicly without evidence? There is a standard that shows if someone is an alcoholic- has he lost jobs, family, dui, jail??

<p>So why is it Kavanaugh doesn&#39;t want an investigation? </p>

<p>Kavanaugh said he welcomes any action by the committee that resolves the matter and clears him, and if that they want a 7th FBI investigation into his past, then he&#39;d be fine with that.</p>

<p>He said this under oath. I don&#39;t know why you and the media keep printing the opposite. You can literally go on c-span right now and see it on video. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kavanaugh was the first to ask for an investigation.  The Democrats had  victims complaint since the beginning of his vetting.  Feinstein had the complaint as well as having  legal counsel established for the victim before she intervied Kavanaugh.  She held on to the information until the last minute.  Victim wanted to remain quiet but Democrats released information without consent.  An investigation was being conducted after the complaint was made public.  Democrats refused to take part in it.  They could have launched their own investigation but they decided to wait until it became time to vote him in.  6 FBI investigations have already been done on this matter.  Ech one with the results of no there there.  Now the 7th  In the USA it;&#39;s innocent until proven guilty.  That means the person making the complaint has to show proof of guilt.  Until that is established the person is innocent.  He does not have to prove he didn&#39;t commit a crime.  That is already given.  That&#39;s the problem here.  Democrats ar pushing that he prove his innocence.  Try this,,Some random person accuses you of a crime.  Just for fun another person backs them up.  Are you guilty because they said so?  Can you prove your innocence?  It&#39;s two against one , who are people going to believe?  Anyone can say anyone committed a crime.  Are we to believe they are telling the truth?  Do you know someone that has never lied?  This is not a new tactic the democrats are using.  They tried it with Clarence Thomas and it didn&#39;t work.  They tried it with Trump and it didn&#39;t work.  The only people it works on are the people that bow out.  That&#39;s because they are guilty.  You forgot the 5th option.  Multiple investigations have already been done finding no harm done.  Kavanaugh makes it through, Democrats and Liberals are screwed for several years to come.  Ford makes millions(she already has close to 1 million made from 17 go fund me accounts) and nothing happens to her.  I tend to go with the 5th.  Here is a link that can assist you.  It helped me and I am glad to share it <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/nominations/supreme/pn2259-115">https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/nominations/supreme/pn2259-115</a>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you provide a source for Kavanaugh asking for a neutral party to investigate the claims?</p>

<p>Feinstein held the claim because Ford requested anonymity. That shows care for the well-being of her constituent more than it shows some underhanded partisan ploy.</p>

<p>What investigation was performed? By committee staff members? The request had been from the beginning to have the FBI investigate so it is done apolitically.</p>

<p>Some random person is already trying to accuse me of a crime on Reddit because they think that is an actual strategy. I could certainly prove my innocence. So yeah, that line of reasoning doesn&#39;t hold.</p>

<p>You believe Thomas too? I&#39;ve got a bridge to sell ya buddy. </p>

<p>And Trump? Now I&#39;m beginning to think you&#39;re just trolling. Surely you can&#39;t be this dumb.</p>

<p>The scope of those investigations did not include his conduct at parties when a teenager. And his conduct at parties as a teenager isn&#39;t even the real problem here, it is him lying about it. So no, your fifth option doesn&#39;t work out. But it was a good effort.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I does not matter if people believe me or not.  I would be a fool if I expected that.  Millions can believe Ford all they want.  Don&#39;t care about that also.  that is to be expected.  The reality  of the situation is that millions more believe in Kavanaugh.  We can assume that Trumps base supports Kavanaugh.  That alone tells you that millions more are behind Kavanaugh.  Real provable facts is all that matter in this case.  This is not a case of popularity.  Decisions will not be based on that. The evidence supports Kavanaugh.  You are correct life is not always fair.  More so when the democrats are in control.  But the democrats are not in control.  There is nothing that will stop Kavanaugh from his appointment.  Democrats are only making themselves look bad.  It&#39;s too bad because it&#39;s the leadership that is doing all the damage.  Not the ranks of the party.  So you are correct &quot;Life&#39;s not always fair, buddy&quot;.  I have a feeling that in the future I will be saying that phrase to a lot of people on the left..  Thank you for your response.  Hat tip to you for keeping it civil.   Looking on further conversations that we may agree or disagree on.,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly you are able to tell that this was a smart ass remark response to another comment.  But if I were serious It wouldn&#39;t go anywhere because I don&#39;t have any politician using me as a political tool and putting me in the spotlight.  Plus had it really happened to me, being a male, I would have enjoyed it..  Had I not been a person who actually were bothered enough by it happening .  I wouldn&#39;t  wait 20- 30 years to report it.  Nobody seems to understand that this sort of stuff only comes out when someone runs for office.  Should be obvious why  this happens.  I did get hammered once and passed out.  Some one told me that some gay guy I worked with gave me head while I was out.  I didn&#39;t care as long as I got off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.  I just find it hard to think Ford was too traumatized.  She has a family and a really good job.  A successful life.  I guess I think that this is not possible to achieve if a person has experienced  being victimized in such a way.  Rape victims have relationship problems.  Sex is a major issue.  There is a lot more to it than that.  I also know personally, women who have been raped, date raped,etc.  Some have spoken up, some liked it, and some too embarrassed or too scared to talk about it.  The pattern that I see is that just about every major position that can be  a major benefit to either party given the final result, and to be specific , the left loses and the right wins.  It looks as if the person on the right  is always a rapist .  For example, Clarence Thomas for SCOTUS, Trump for POTUS ,Kavanaugh for SCOTUS.  I think part that is  key is that Feinstein had the complaint and proceed with in the appropriate manner.  She also doxxed Ford.  This is not her first time to the ball game.  She knew exactly what she was doing.  This is where i have the biggest problem.  To be fair, Bill Clinton had also been attacked in this manner also.

    <div class="md"><p>That guy assassinated his own character, what a mess! I’m not from the US so don’t care either way about Republicans or Democrats and for what it’s worth it looks definitely like the Democrats are using the woman in a way to get as much political leverage rather than in a way that’s best for her, but come on. The man is a joke. I couldn’t believe someone like that, who talks like that and lies so blatantly under oath (we all know what those various terms mean) could even be considered for such a role. The US is fucked. The lunatics are running the asylum. It’s happening where I am too. That’s the real conspiracy. Extremist ‘sovereign individual’  neofeudal elites are currently taking over with the aim of solidifying the power of corporations and the very wealthiest. And they managed to convince a bunch of conspiracy theorists to support them! It’d be a marvel if it wasn’t so fucking depressing. No one is paying attention to what’s really going on and what they’re really up to behind all this stupid theatre and petty divide and conquer bullshit. </p>

On the DC court of appeals he supported indefinite detention of American citizens with little to no evidence.  He signed onto a judgment that blocked wrongfully detained prisoners who were tortured from being able to sue the private contractors that tortured them.  Unfortunately these proceedings haven’t been transparent enough to know just how involved he was in Bush’s overriding of previously in place torture laws but what we do know is he holds the neocon position on illegal detention and torture everywhere he’s on record.</p>
