        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-09-29 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Jac0b777.html">Jac0b777</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have posted a similar comment elsewhere, but I&#39;d like to reiterate this here, as I think it is quite relevant to the situation we see unfolding all across the web. It is becoming quite obvious now to anyone truly watching - they are censoring the Internet before our very eyes.</p>

<p>It started with YouTube and their demonetizations of &quot;controversial content&quot;, it continued with much of that content also being simply removed. </p>

<p>[<a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/59jgka/a-brief-history-of-youtube-censorship">A brief history of Youtube Censorship</a>]</p>

<p>In these times, the term &quot;fake news&quot; was born. And although there is plenty of actual fake news on the Internet, the main intention of it was highly likely not very benevolent. As we have seen, it, in many ways, appeared in order to create a label that would immediately create a negative emotional reaction in people and put that label onto anything that the mainstream media desires to censor or discredit in its totality.</p>

<p>It continued with Google itself announcing it would hire staff that would <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2015/03/02/google-decides-what-is-fact-in-new-search-results-ranking-system/">&quot;curate&quot; search results for controversial topics in order to fight fake news and misinformation - Google has thus decided it will become an arbiter of truth, it has decided to base its search results on &quot;facts&quot;, not links</a>. Nowadays you can see that for certain search phrases, Google displays results that are very much in line with the mainstream narrative, pushing other results to later pages.</p>

<p>Alex Jones, like him or hate him, should not have been removed the way he was - he was taken down from every social media site, YouTube and now his PayPal account has been blocked. No matter whether he is controlled opposition or not - he has been banned without a second thought...and this has set a dangerous precedent. The media apparatus is flexing its muscles and the corporate powers (as well as the rich families behind them) are showing what they can do. </p>

<p>Reddit has followed suit, as it deleted many subs in relation to the Q conspiracy theory (which I personally do not believe in, however I disagree with the censorship) such as r/greatawakening. Now many subreddits on the list of subreddits certain mods desired banned have been quarantined.</p>

<p>Of course here we cannot forget the ominous push for the destruction of Net Neutrality in the US and the horrific EU law based on Articles 11 and 13, that will create a censorship apparatus of magnanimous proportions (dubbed the &quot;anti-meme&quot; law, as it would destroy memes, but that title doesn&#39;t do it justice, as that is the least of what this censorship monster can do)</p>

<p>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89ZkydX0FPw&amp;amp;">Article 13 presented simply in a wonderful satirical video</a>]</p>

<p>[A site for taking action, if you are from the EU: <a href="http://www.saveyourinternet.eu">saveyoutinternet.eu</a>]</p>

<p><em>By the way, this law has already been passed! There is however another discussion taking place about it in January - contact your representatives by then if you are from the EU! I have done so once and will do it again, as I am from the EU myself.</em></p>

<hr/>

<p>If you look at the whole picture it becomes very obvious this goes far beyond any of these events individually. These companies that influence and curate web traffic and have an incredible monopoly on the Internet in terms of user-bases, are working together... and they are very slowly making their moves. </p>

<p>But the moves are also being made by governments and other non-governmental organizations. It seems the agenda has been set and is being manifested into reality in perfect synchronicity by all parties involved.</p>

<p>All of this is happening very slowly, so that people will accept it. It is also happening in such a way that the censored parties are portrayed as villains, labelled hate speech or dubbed &quot;misinformation&quot; as has now happened with r/911truth.</p>

<p>Anyone that has truly looked will see that they are censoring far more than truly extreme hate-speech (and is even censoring that ever beneficial? Does that not simply radicalize actual hate groups even more?)- they are censoring things they don&#39;t want the public to see or topics they don&#39;t want people to debate. </p>

<p>The Internet has proven itself a vital weapon in the hands of the awakening movement. They see this and they are trying to correct their mistake. We should not let them correct it.</p>

<p>If we all refuse to be censored, they cannot censor us. It is a good idea to move to different platforms (<a href="http://www.saidit.net">www.saidit.net</a> perhaps?), to have actual discussions with like minded individuals, but remaining, at least to a degree, in mainstream battlefields such as Reddit, is crucial in order to spread various information to a wider audience. </p>

<p>When facing a mainstream audience, it is always crucial to present information in a manner that is coherent and articulate, as well as based on as many sources as one can find. It should also come from a place of peace and compassion, not hatred. If this is done, then the censorship will become much harder, as even the mainstream masses will see how obvious the supposed &quot;hate speech&quot; is anything but that - how could it be if it contains no hate?</p>

<p>Spread awareness of the subjects that matter, help spread solutions whenever possible, but always try to do it without resorting to hate, anger or fear. Also, speak against censorship whenever you can - it could be or your controversial opinions that are censored next.</p>

<p>As said, an option is definitely to move to other platforms, however if slowly everything gets censored, the only thing left would be blockchain based communication. </p>

<p><strong>Any ideas you may have, any solutions that may be simmering in your minds - now is the time to put them forth and discuss them.</strong></p>

<p>And remember, take care of yourself and your health, both physical and mental. Meditate, introspect, allow yourself to find peace within, that is actually present right now ; allow yourself to open to the possibility of life being more than merely the material if you are ready to do so. Also, engage in real, genuine connections with real people in your everyday life - this is crucial for any New Earth to thrive. </p>

<p>Bless you all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones was apart of it. They built him up to knock him down so SJW idiots would brigade behind this censorship. Every liberal/left leaving person I&#39;ve talked to is like he was pushing for violence and doxxing people. Well then, why didn&#39;t silicon valley cite &quot;inciting violence&quot; as a means to take him down? They cited hate speech cause it&#39;s vague and easy to use now that you idiots agreed and gave them this ability. </p>

<p>There is a vast majority of liberal people that don&#39;t want to question the bigger narrative here. I hope this Orwellian state will at least put an end to war, provide the basic needs or just clean water so we can get off this planet. That would be a silver lining I could get behind and move forward I suppose. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) get a conspiracy leaning guy to start spouting all the craziest most insane conspiracies. Shit you can&#39;t prove.  They are pedo-satanic-psychic-lizard people vampires and they are trucking you into believing the Earth is flat. </p>

<p>2) build that guy up in the media heavily. Get an interview with Megyn Kelly, hell give him a phone call with the President. Make sure the mainstream people that didn&#39;t know who he was now knows what he is about... Harassing families of a school shooting tragedy. </p>

<p>3) collude with 4 of the biggest tech firms to silence this guy and say that it&#39;s cause he is damaging and pushing for violence. Make the official citation be a vague formerly uneforceable law called hate speech. Except hate speech is vague so now you need to see how the people react. </p>

<p>4) people react but most of them are happy with this. They say he is a nut job that deserves to be silenced and people akin to him shouldn&#39;t be allowed to spout dissent because Google Facebook Twitter Spotify are all private entities and have the right to censor anyone they want. </p>

<p>5) they just won by using a &quot;troofer&quot; to silently take away free speech and dissent. Now they can cite hate speech, which is an incredibly vague thing to take down any sort of information they don&#39;t want out to the public. That&#39;s why it&#39;s happening on Reddit now. <a href="/r/911truth">/r/911truth</a> is gone. They fucking were flaunting it with <a href="/r/banout2018">/r/banout2018</a> which had innocuous subreddits like <a href="/r/Jordan">/r/Jordan</a> Peterson on their list of to be banned subs. </p>

<p>Now do you see what Im getting at? I&#39;ve been into questioning conspiracies for over 12 years. Alex Jones never sat right with me. While real heroes like Michael Hastings were getting gunned down in the streets (figure of speech) for reporting legit conspiracies AJ was allowed to build a platform and say ludicrous bullshit. They built him up as the candle that normies would hold all conspiracy theorist to. &quot;oh you think XYZ conspiracy is true you must be a flat earther that only listens to Infowars. Classic build a character up in the MSM then knock him down. All the sheep were too busy talking about he should or shouldnt be censored. When it should&#39;ve been a conversation about A) we should be seeking alternatives to these big four B) should we really allow them to cite a vague thing as hate speech as a law to censor people.  Hate speech = wrong speak. #makeorwellfictionagain </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t know I don&#39;t watch him. That&#39;s not the point. He is into the most ludicrous end of the conspiracy realm is my point. There are laughable conspiracies like that, and then there is the CIA drug smuggling into Mena Arkansas co-opted by Bill Clinton. That&#39;s my point. The ones that actually mean anything get overshadowed by this stupid conspiracies. Can&#39;t have a conversation with people like yourself. Just jump in to attack and say Im done?

    <div class="md"><p>Vague thumbs up to censorship?  The hell are you talking about?  You know what... Don&#39;t worry about it... That&#39;s beside the point.  I don&#39;t know why 911 was shut down, but I do know that if it was an agenda, then they wouldn&#39;t allow a tread to remain up for those people to gather that is literally named the r/conspiracy.  This is either the worst censorship in history, or it came to it&#39;s organic conclusion.  There isn&#39;t enough information out there (that I&#39;ve seen) to make a call for the former.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is likely to be more of a corporate interest to shut down these controversial subreddits over time, not one that is by request of any federal government.</p>

<p>I do kind of get the feeling that Reddit is utilizing the purging of the Q bs to get rid of other subreddits that do not contain advertiser friendly content. </p>

<p>While this would have been of less concern to them just a few years ago, plans of taking Reddit public are in the works. Once a company goes public and earnings per share become the ultimate focus, the urge to get rid of any content that could produce negative PR that also doesn&#39;t make money for the company skyrockets. (This is a bad thing for Redditors in general though, as a fully streamlined version of Reddit is going to be missing many more subreddits that have nothing to do with conspiracies)</p>

<p>Who knows, but it would be nice to see /conspiracy and old school conspiracy subreddits that are about stuff like JFK or 9/11 cleared from this whole mess.</p>

<p>I still think shutting down those Q subreddits is kind of unfair for the loons who aren&#39;t actually going around threatening or stalking, though, a mass ban wave for those who are guilty seems more fit to me. </p>

<p>Times are changing though, it just sucks that I have to end up picking between an ever more policed Reddit or some under populated place full of trolls like Voat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a choice you&#39;ll have to make.  Personally I don&#39;t think it is a meaningful one.  But we may just disagree on this: I&#39;m all for businesses being able to set the terms of their service.  If either of those parties (in this case: redditor or company) break that agreement they should be &quot;punished&quot; (either by losing posting privilege or user support respectively).</p>

<p>As for shutting entire threads down: I agree that it should not be done UNLESS it is a systemic problem.  If you have a thread called r/wheretohuntkids... Shut that shit down.  If the thread is called r/followPhil, wait until Phil starts calling for blood.</p>

<p>In the end it&#39;s up to Reddit (or YouTube or whatever) to make the calls.  Hopefully those calls won&#39;t go too far.  Until then, let&#39;s keep having fun.  :)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the fight is over yet. To give up now and say that everything is already lost means that this is exactly what will happen - everything will actually be lost. It&#39;s not over till&#39; the fat lady sings, as they say. </p>

<p>The moment you say it&#39;s over, it&#39;s actually over -  but as long as you don&#39;t give up and bury your head in the sand, there is always a chance to improve the situation or perhaps even turn things around fully (as Utopian as that may sound). If we see ourselves as more than individuals, but as part of humanity, as well as the living-breathing ecosystem that is this planet, we cannot ever stop engaging in actions that help improve this planet and society as a whole (this doesn&#39;t mean that you need to do it 24/7 of course, we all have personal lives as well). In fact, I would say, that the more you open your heart, the more such activism arises and flows naturally - yet so many of us are suppressing it. </p>

<p>I say we fight - then we either win or die trying and lose. But anything is better than giving up.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship</a></p>

<p>&quot;Censorship is the suppression of speech, public communication, or other information, on the basis that such material is considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, or &quot;inconvenient&quot; as determined by a government[1] or private institution,[2] for example, corporate censorship.&quot; </p>

<p>See where it says private institution? Yeah dude it&#39;s censorship. stop standing up for these fucking monolithic entities because you think you are progressive. Hate speech laws are fucking absurd and you idiots keep standing by them citing it as a progressive thing to do, to protect people from hate. No one should be the arbiter of speech that&#39;s the point of free speech and free thought. This logic you have is stupid and you can&#39;t even read a definition properly I have to source it for you.

<p>Already happening fren. It&#39;s a good solution. Problem is blockchain based systems can still be fucked with. As with steemit whales can collude to downvote content into oblivion and essentially push out others. It becomes a money game on that platform. so it is still a cabal problem similar to what we already have. But yes this is pretty much the only solution, competition. Isn&#39;t free market capitalism great? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You vastly underrate the power of the federal rate being so low that people were forced to invest money or lose (aka, the first big rounds of angel investing during the phone era, which were a gold rush).  Now the fed rate is higher, so investment has dried up for new players to have the insane war chests of money that the old players like Reddit and Digg had.  We&#39;re in a new era, winners were chosen.  Now we wait and watch how things play out.  The best chance isn&#39;t a new site, it&#39;s side communities and &quot;identities&quot; or influencers (if you want to jump on the naming bandwagon).  </p>

<p>What&#39;s weird is we&#39;re seeing influencers get silenced and censored.  And this second wave of censorship is aimed at communities. They can&#39;t take all communities down, because that almost guarantees new ones popping up. So you have to just keep moving to new communities and propping up new influencers and be especially aware to avoid councils (a tool shown to be used in the past) and avoid getting too behind certain influencers who might be controlled. The questions that are asked are always the single most important part of the entire sphere of influence and truth.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post, and thankyou for writing it.</p>

<p>I feel that both the internet, and peoples&#39; thought in general is being censored.</p>

<p>In particular, the definition of the truth. Apparently now truth can be subjective, and what one person <em>feels</em> about an issue can trump what the demonstrable facts are.</p>

<p>For instance, and I know I&#39;m going to step on some toes here, but the trans issue. I believe it is impossible to surgically change a biological man into a biological female or vice versa. I say this as a person with near 20 years of gender issues myself.</p>

<p>Gender roles are not genders. A man can soothe a child, and a woman can fell a tree. These are learned skills. A man cannot give birth to a child, and a woman cannot produce semen. These are innate attributes (and yes, some women cannot give birth and some men cannot produce semen, but no woman can produce semen, and no man can give birth). These attributes are down to chromosomes, XX or XY. There are some genetic conditions which give people an indistinct gender appearance, but these are rare, and are not what transgender politics claims.</p>

<p>Gender is not fashion. A man can wear a skirt and grow his hair long, and a woman can wear pants and cut her hair short. These things are style, not gender.</p>

<p>One can also believe they are the opposite gender, but this does not make it true. One can believe they are anything they want to be, but it is the actual being of such that makes it so.</p>

<p>But to say so is said to be transphobic.</p>

<p>And therein lies my point. The very telling of the objective truth has become an offensive act.</p>

<p>We truly have entered dangerous times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you - but I do not think the future is as bleak as you stated here. I think there are plenty of chances and options we still have. I also believe (and have seen with my own eyes, but in real life and on the Internet) that people are actually waking up in many ways - and desire a change for the better in all areas of society, whether it be free speech, environmental protection, less corruption, more compassion, peace and no more wars....</p>

<p>Either way, we should fight for free speech, peace and compassion until the end. There is no giving up in my book.</p>

<p>This may seem insignificant, but remember, censorship-free, decentralized financial privacy is just as important as free-speech, in fact it technically is free-speech (your money, your decision). But not if they destroy the competition with their bought and paid for sockpuppets and voters.</p>
