        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Reddit will take out 12 Iranians accounts if actual people with no connections to an Iranian online team that are real citizens sharing about Yemen. They&#39;ll delete Russians who point out Israel Saudi atrocities. These Russians are private people not in a group of the russian government. They&#39;ll block Americans who show evidence against Israel. Yet they will never block the Israeli online government driven PR accounts that comment on all Israeli Iranian Saudi topics. They will call for the complete removal of all Arabs in Israel, the death of all Shia Muslims, the death of every Persian and not ever get in trouble. They spread lies about Iran having nukes and then delete comments showing the 13 countries in Iran right now overlooking it all. It&#39;s obvious that the reddit corporation is conspiring with governments and groups to manipulate information and people. This includes elections, calls to war, and making people misinformed To support policies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t even say jews. I say Israelis. I am Jewish and the power Jewish mod there called me antisemitic and banned me for posting that a large group of Israeli Russian dual citizens were in the steel dossier and have been indicted or investigated by Mueller. Israeli shill army advocating the steel dossier then point out Israelis are In it and ban they think the dossier is fake. They point out Muslims killing gays so I posted the article where 3 Israelis drug a gay Israeli to the dessert and tied him to a fence and slowly killed him. Ban ban ban. I even sent him private info of me being Jewish and he called me a bad jew and blocked me lol. Like fucking crazy. I also found their little group on diaspora.Org where they post reddit links so they can come shill it. My aunt in Israel also showed me into a few more groups of IDF and israeli gocernment run forums to stop antisemitism. It&#39;s not to stop antisemitism, it&#39;s to stop people. From trashing the Israeli government because they even target US jews who support Israel and hate Netanyahu. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>r/worldnews is a hot spot for all governments shill armies. Israel&#39;s shills are relentless, but typically easy to spot. I feel like they go too overboard though and actually make people more against them. The US and Russia have probably the best &quot;shill armies&quot;, and are a lot harder to spot. Beyond governments, we also have a lot of companies with teams on reddit 24/7. Control the narrative, control the masses. It sucks, but it&#39;s also a really interesting thing to witness. Use your critical reading and thinking skills, and try to remain objective and mindful your own biases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel is threatened by Iran&#39;s nuclear capabilities, and Israel is prevented from becoming the most dominant country on Earth so long as America exists.</p>

<p>Currently, Israel uses the U.S. to generate money and products and fight wars on its behalf, but when Israel no longer needs the U.S. (i.e., when the U.S. &quot;neutralizes&quot; Iran, Israel&#39;s final remaining threat in the region), Israel will do away with the U.S. and replace it as the new leading world superpower.</p>

<p>It seems to me that in the relatively near future, powerful Israeli and U.S. individuals will conspire to conduct an epic false flag attack on the U.S. (e.g. an EMP followed by nuclear attacks on major cities, including Washington, D.C.), and frame Iran or perhaps North Korea with funding allegedly from Iran. This will create the necessary pretext to justify the destruction of Iran; allies of the U.S. would seem to have no choice but to attack/nuke Iran, and Israel, who orchestrated these events behind the scenes, will have successfully rid itself of the two countries standing in the way of it becoming a &quot;hyperpower&quot; without most people even recognizing Israel&#39;s involvement or how much they benefited from these events.</p>
