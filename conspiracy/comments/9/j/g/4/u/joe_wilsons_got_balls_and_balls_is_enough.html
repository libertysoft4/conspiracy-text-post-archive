<p>They don&#39;t. Bush is far more popular among Republicans than Democrats, far far more popular. There are just far fewer Republicans now than their used to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>False. The French, British, German, Russian and other foreign newscasts with their photos have reported 2,000,000+ protestors. Even Homeland Security admits 2 million.

    <div class="md"><p>By any actual evidence it was far less than 100,000 people. Now how about you provide some references for your claims? What French, British, etc. sources said over 2 million? Where is the Homeland Security estimate? Where is a picture of a full Mall? And how come there was no traffic problem, no Metro problem if all those people were there? A million is an enormous number of people and that breaks the transit system, 2 million is way past overload.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, my reference for the press releases is the Alex Jones Show. But I&#39;ll be happy to dig up the original articles just to prove you wrong.</p>

<p>EDIT: 
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1213056/Up-million-march-US-Capitol-protest-Obamas-spending-tea-party-demonstration.html">Daily Mail</a> has adjusted their claim from 2 million to 1 million in reaction to the Newcorp/Disney/Viacom/AOL/Clear Channel media smear against the official numbers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opzGLW_UcmM">Local police</a> estimates were at 1.2 million (as were <a href="http://www.jmblog.com/2009/09/14/1-2-million-angry-protesters-march-on-capital-and-the-mainstream-news-ignores-it/">Parks and Recreation</a>&#39;s estimates referenced by Michele Malkin), Homeland Security was at 2 million, and french press estimated upwards of 3 million. The original average estimates were between 2 - 3.5 million.</p>

<p>To be fair, you can&#39;t get an exact count, but all estimates outside the puppet media conglomerate are in the millions.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.wikio.com/video/1647495">time lapse video</a>. That&#39;s only a building cam on one street towards the center area, there were intersections and roads clogged with people for miles in that area.</p>
