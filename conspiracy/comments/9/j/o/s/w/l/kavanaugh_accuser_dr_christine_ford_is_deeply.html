        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Accuser Christine Blasey Ford has deep connections to CIA. Savage states his research team found the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>She is the head of CIA undergrad intern program at Stanford University (recruitment center/gateway to the clowns)</p></li>
<li><p>Her brother Ralph Blasey III worked for the law firm Baker-Hostetler that created Fusion GPS that wrote Russian dossier
Law firm Baker-Hostetler is located in same building that operates 3 CIA companies: Red Coats Inc, Admiral Security Services, Datawatch</p></li>
<li><p>Her father Ralph Blasey II operates those three companies</p></li>
<li><p>Her Grandfather Nicholas D. worked for the CIA and received a commendation from Former Director Casey</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Then, The Gateway Pundit posted an article yesterday pertaining to CBF&#39;s strange architectural detail at her house - &quot;two front doors&quot;. My initial response was that a second front door is very unusual, as many jurisdictions do not allow this per building code. In any case, it is a very expensive remodel which does not lend itself to most home designs. TGP posted:</p>

<p>&quot;FORD CAUGHT IN MAJOR LIE? — City Remodeling Permits Show Project She Linked to Kavanaugh Was in 2008 NOT 2012 Jim Hoft by Jim Hoft September 27, 2018 LYING UNDER OATH TO THE US SENATE IS A CRIME– Christine Blasey Ford told the US Senate Judiciary Committee that the memories of Brett Kavanaugh “first came up” when she went into counseling in 2012. In May 2012 Ford and her husband argued over her desire to add “a second front door” to their home. Ford told the committee on Thursday the desire for a second door was because Brett Kavanaugh made her “claustrophobic.” But there may have been something else…</p>

<p>As Paul Sperry reported on Thursday night. The Palo Alto building permits were issued to Ford and her husband in 2008 — NOT 2012.</p>

<p>Paul Sperry: Palo Alto bldg permit records raise questions about Ford’s testimony she completed an “extensive remodel” of home in 2012 &amp; that this was seminal event that led her down path to coming out against Kavanaugh b/c she needed to add an escape door. Permit was issued in 2008.&quot;</p>

<p>According to one tweet cited in TGP&#39;s article: &quot;she built an addition on the house that they rent out !!!!! not for safety I pulled the property tax records she even said they use for google interns been verified even shows renters that receive mail at that address&quot;</p>

<p>What does this mean? If Savage is right, and CBF&#39;s family has deep CIA ties, and CBP built an addition on her house (second front door), that she rents to Google interns - a strong connection has been made CBP-Stanford-CIA-Google. Now add in the Feinstein jokes with CBP about the &quot;2nd front door&quot; and her &quot;claustrophobia&quot; and a very compelling case has been made to support that CBP&#39;s testimony is 100% fraudulent and part of the larger plot to usurp the Judiciary and continue the silent coup the Deep State is waging upon POTUS.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if this is the case, I would be willing to stretch and say her baby voice, ditzy behavior, and all of her &quot;persona&quot; were nothing more than an act. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>SS: Michael Savage&#39;s research team has allegedly found information which ties Mrs. Ford to the CIA. Above are the accusations of connections between the two including. Attached in this post is also a odd connection regarding &quot;double doors&quot;. </p>

<p>There is a very strong possibility that Mrs. Ford was in fact sexually assaulted, but her timing to speak out and her accusation of who it was exactly has raised eyebrows. With what has been said, and what we are seeing from various subreddits regarding Judge K, the entire thing seems calculated and orchestrated - but is important to remember that while accusations may fly, one must trust but verify. </p>

<p>Contest mode makes it worse too. I used to be in favor of that idea, but all context mode does is allow them to brigade without having to even try and hide it.

</blockquote>

<p>Firstly, this is not misinfo. Misninfo would be accusing someone of sexual assault only to have the 4 witnesses you chose to verify your claims say it never happened and they have zero recollection of the accusing doing so.</p>

<p>Additionally, this</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Baker and Holstedter hired Fusion GPS, they didn’t create it. They also hired them on behalf of Prevezon, the company of Veselnitskaya (the Russian Lawyer) that Grassley alleges was a front for the Kremlin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is a great attempt as sliding the information and redirecting the narrative back towards &quot;The Russians!&quot; story people have pushing. Its a slide, a weak one but a slide. This has absolutely nothing to do with Kremlin and even if so, you provided not a single factual link with any form of source to back up your claim. That in and of itself, is an example of spreading misinformation. Until you provide any sources which validate your claims that is. </p>

<p>Lastly, you claim &quot;If these arguments are so damning why do they rely on outright lies?&quot;</p>

<p>Once again, they are not lies as sources have been provided. </p>

<p>“Veselnitskaya, through Baker Hostetler, hired Glenn Simpson of the firm Fusion GPS to conduct a smear campaign against me and Sergei Magnitsky in advance of congressional hearings on the Global Magnitsky Act,” Browder will testify. “He contacted a number of major newspapers and other publications to spread false information that Sergei Magnitsky was not murdered, was not a whistleblower and was instead a criminal. They also spread false information that my presentations to lawmakers around the world were untrue.”</p>

<p>Fusion GPS has confirmed it worked on a lawsuit involving Veselnitskaya for two years, The Post&#39;s Josh Rogin reported. It denied any involvement in the Trump Jr. meeting.</p>

<p>You said that the firm created Fusion without a source, can you prove that?</p>

<p>Can you also explain how Blasey III is theoretically involved in any actions a law firm he left in 2004 did in 2016?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I just recently got interested in this whole Kavanaugh thing. In an effort to familiarize myself with the basics, I did 2 searches... both using the search terms &quot;Kavanaugh story basics&quot;.</p>

<p>One search was on Google and I used duckduckgo for the other. Right away, I noticed that the Google search results were a lot different than DDG. Most of the google links had something to do with sexual assault allegations, while DDG actually gave me some links about Kavanaugh&#39;s career history, political leanings etc.</p>

<p>Feel free to compare the 2.</p>

<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=kavanaugh+story+basics&amp;amp;t=hg&amp;amp;ia=news">DDG</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.co.zm/search?q=kavanaugh+story+basics&amp;amp;oq=kavanaugh+story+basics&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i60.5295j0j8&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">Google</a></p>

<p>My initial impression is that Kavanaugh, as a Supreme Court Justice, would be a feminist&#39;s nightmare. He&#39;s also got some other views that I disagree with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On hot-button questions, Mr. Kavanaugh has trended conservative on issues such as abortion, indicating a narrow view of what constitutes an undue burden on a woman’s right to end her pregnancy, and the Obamacare contraception mandate, though his take on the mandate was somewhat more conciliatory than right-wing activists would prefer. A nemesis of the administrative state, he has frequently voted against the Environmental Protection Agency, arguing that programs to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions and cross-border air pollution went further than the law allowed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>he lauded former Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist for having dissented in Roe vs. Wade and for rejecting the notion of “a wall of separation between church and state.”</p>

<p>He also praised the late chief justice’s unsuccessful effort to throw out the so-called “exclusionary rule,” which forbids police from using illegally obtained evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So now I&#39;m going to say some unpopular things. There&#39;s no way to prevent him from being appointed to the SCOTUS except for him to be disqualified/rejected as a nominee.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what the sexual misconduct allegations are all about. But this struggle has a definite Nietzschean quality to it. How so? </p>

<p>To fight a monster you must sometimes become a monster. And this is what the liberal/feminist alliance is doing in their struggle to block the Kavanaugh appointment.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t have any evidence of corruption or illegal deeds. They don&#39;t have anything that disqualifies him from serving. So they&#39;ve had to resort to a personal attack, a character assassination.</p>

<p>In this, they have resorted to allegations of sexually inappropriate behavior that date back 36 years to when Kavanaugh himself <strong>was only 17 years old</strong>.</p>

<p>In another accusation...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Swetnick claims she witnessed Kavanaugh partake in inappropriate behavior <strong>while they were in high school in the early 1980s</strong>. </p>

<p>In a sworn affidavit to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Swetnick claims to have seen instances at multiple parties where Kavanaugh engaged in &quot;abusive&quot; behavior toward women. She says Kavanaugh and others attempted to spike girls&#39; drinks in order to make it easier for them to be sexually assaulted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I&#39;m supposed to think that a guy should be disqualified from serving as a Supreme Court Justice because a girl saw him spiking the drinks one time when they were in High School?</p>

<p>And the last part sounds like her way of saying they hoped the girls would get a bit drunk and (hopefully) a bit more friendly.</p>

<p>So go ahead and block the guy if he seems too partisan. But do yourself a favor and don&#39;t set a precedent of character assassination based on exaggerated accounts of a man&#39;s sexual behavior while he was a teenager and a minor.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just nuts. It&#39;s also an aspect of this story that the weak-minded Pavlovian mouth-breathers over at r/news, r/politics and this sub seem to being ignoring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with some of Kavanaugh&#39;s positions. Feminists disagree with some of his other ones.</p>

<p>But imo, the feminist push has gone too far. This whole shit show is a good example of that. Basically it&#39;s #metoo on steroids. How?</p>

<p>They&#39;re using allegations of sexual misconduct (when the guy was a teenager) in order to destroy his personal reputation for political effect.</p>

<p>And these are the same people who get outraged about Asia Argento having sex with a guy because he was only 17. Yet, if it&#39;s a Trump political appointment, all of a sudden a 17 yr guy is expected to 100% responsible for their sexual behavior?</p>

<p>Can&#39;t have it both ways but that&#39;s what they&#39;re (feminists) trying to do.</p>

<p>lmao!!! ...I appreciate your research, but the &quot;left&quot; has been wretched for a long time.  Just look up the number of left-wing terrorists.  The left for the last 50 years has ALWAYS been the one to stoop low.  To violence, name-calling, theft, bribery, bullying, &quot;free-bleeding&quot;, letting illegals vote, open borders, etc.  The left sucks now....which is why (admittedly during the bernie sanders debacle /stealing of his campaign)....I walked away from the DNC.  Fuck em. The party can burn now.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the Trump Party vs the Femocrats. And we get a combo media circus and political freak show. That&#39;s what all of this is, dirty politics as entertainment for the masses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is in plain sight. All the media is gung ho on this. The question is why? There it is. The appointment of Kavanaugh will be nightmare for left, and SJWs and feminazis. No wonder, they are desperate. Who to use? Dr. Ford, a pussyhat Feminist. What to do? A &#39;false&#39; completely made up &#39;story&#39; of distant past. No one will be able to corroborate or prove. So where is profit?? Delay, good chance in the midterm, Dems might make good ground, then the &#39;threat&#39; can be nullified using vote.</p>

<p>I mean this is so obvious &#39;plot&#39;, a little kid with minimum intelligence can &#39;see through&#39; the BS. </p>

<p>Even if the story is 100% accurate and factual (and I&#39;m not saying it is) it&#39;s a nothing burger. Why?</p>

<p>Because, if my understanding of the date and his age at the time is correct, he was only 17 and therefore a minor at the time. There won&#39;t be any charges. </p>

<p>The really significance of this aspect lies on a tangent. The significance is this... the people who want to block the Kavanaugh nomination are willing to take 2018 standards of social/sexual conduct and retroactively apply them to the actions of a minor in 1982.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more, they&#39;re willing to do this because it suits their own political desires. Not only that, but they&#39;ve set the bar lower than it&#39;s ever been before in terms of the outrage trigger.</p>

<p>In plain English: In 1982, a guy who was only 17 tried to convince a girl who was 15 to make out with him... maybe even have sex with him. He was aggressive and forceful (maybe even drunk?). But there was no sex and he left off after a while. </p>

<p>In 2018, if you were a feminazi or SJW, you might be able to stretch the definition of sexual assault enough to apply it to what happened. But that does/should not hold water in a legal sense. This is for a few reasons:</p>

<p>One, he was 17.</p>

<p>Two, can&#39;t retroactively charge someone who did something <em>before</em> the laws or definitions changed.</p>

<p>Three, zero physical evidence to back up any of the allegations... this is a case of he said/she said (like it or not).</p>

<p>The real problem is that the Femocrats have sunk to a new low in order to block a Trump/Conservative nominee for the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>And just to be balanced, I&#39;m not a Kavanaugh supporter myself. But I&#39;m dismayed by the tactics, the Dems/Feminists are willing to employ against him. Even if they succeed, they still lose.</p>
