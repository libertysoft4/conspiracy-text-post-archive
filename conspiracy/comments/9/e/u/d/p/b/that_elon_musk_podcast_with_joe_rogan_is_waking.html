        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When you look at the comments on that video (which has become kinda &quot;mainstream&quot; by now) and even on some of the news sites reporting the event (mainly the &quot;pot smoking&quot; thing and nothing else); you realise that virtually everyone is criticizing the fact that the media is conveniently ignoring the many, many points of intelligent discussion presented in that interview while focusing only on the weed; while entirely ignoring the far greater poison called alcohol being consumed freely.  </p>

<p>This is good news because finally (FINALLY!), the sleeping sheep amongst us are realizing that the idea of &quot;fake news&quot; can be an <em>actual thing.</em> That the idea of a media/journalism watchdog website as suggested by Elon Musk (irrespective of the fact that it may not work as hoped IRL) isn&#39;t something to joke about anymore.  </p>

<p>So slowly but surely, we are making progress and honestly, every small bit of progress deserves attention. As it is, we are all a wee bit too negative around r/conspiracy these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Elon has an alternate base than say Donald, Alex, or Jimmy Dore. He’s a businessman, smart, &amp; productive. Many who swear off politics still invest. There’s money in that. You have to pay attention.</p>

<p>Granted I don’t share his views on AI, but this is legend.</p>

<p>“I tried to convince people to slow down, slow down AI. To regulate AI. This was futile. I tried for years. Nobody listened. Nobody listened.</p>

<p>Nobody listened.</p>

<p>Maybe they will. So far they haven&#39;t. I don&#39;t think that people, that normal people don&#39;t get the way regulations work. It&#39;s very slow, very slow indeed. So, usually there will be something, some new technology that will cause damage or death. There will be an outcry, there will be an investigation. Years will pass.</p>

<p>There will be some sort of insight committee, there will be rulemaking, then their will be oversight, eventually regulations. This all takes many years. This is the normal course of things. If you look at say Automotive Regulations, how long did it take for say Seat Belts, to be implemented, to be Required? The Automotive industry fought Seat Belts for more than a decade. Successfully fought any regulations on Seat Belts, even though the numbers were extremely obvious. If you had a seat belt on, you&#39;d be far less likely to die or be severely injured. It was unequivocal. And the industry fought this for years, successfully. Eventually after many many people died, regulators insisted on Seat Belts.</p>

<p>This Time is not relevant to AI. You can&#39;t take years from the point at which it is dangerous, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/6ntae5/you_have_the_math_you_have_the_ability_now_apply/">it&#39;s too late</a>.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In short, no technology (power, money, influence) can be stopped. Better to acquire, understand, and distribute said technology as opposed to fighting, censoring, and concentrating.</p>

<p>I also disagree with Elon&#39;s statement regarding &#39;more knowledge&#39;, as in Machines smarter than Humans. Until Machines problem solve major innovations (like NASA CPU&#39;s invent a forcefield without being instructed to), then they don&#39;t have &#39;more knowledge&#39;. Or they have more knowledge the same way robots have more leg power than humans. Sure they do, but humans run the robots. Sure AI will get big and powerful, but humans run the AI.</p>

<p>The risk is having too few good humans involved (which is created by demonizing the industry) as opposed &#39;once unleashed it can&#39;t be stopped, world over man, world over!&#39;</p>

<p>Elon&#39;s statement on how regulations are formed is very correct however. And how industry can negatively influence against statistics. And how a problem can be known for decades, introvertedly, and still be allowed to exists because the market forces do not dictate a solution is required, etc.</p>

<p>If Seat Belts were delayed decades, Roundup poison delayed decades... what else? Our systems for evaluating and addressing problems is more problematic than this one particular instance of AI, IMO.</p>

<p>That&#39;s true until it isn&#39;t. An artificial general intelligence that&#39;s as &quot;smart&quot; as a human will very quickly eclipse human intelligence, and then cannot be kept in a box by any number of humans. It&#39;s hard to wrap ones mind around what being 10 times smarter would be like, and a million times is beyond conception, but is within the realm of the possible.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s true assuming the technology is a tool that can be wielded. </p>

<p>But, that&#39;s not what Elon is talking about. </p>

<p>Elon is talking about the development of an intelligence that might not put its best interests before our own.  <a href="https://youtu.be/7X0m40dBPAI?t=116">This is the kind of scenery you should be invisioning.</a> What do we do when our technology begins to view its us as a tool? </p>

<p>Specific to the discussion between Mush and Rogan they basically established that such AI would so hyper-intelligent as to consider us little more than animals the way we do with chimpanzes. How often do you think about chimps? Look at their plight, loss of habitat, experimentation, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZLZW8Deq8vE?t=46">It might be so different, so intelligent that it is like this.</a></p>

<p>You can see Elon&#39;s fatalism in his mannerisms when talking about it. He&#39;s convinced the end is near. It&#39;s probably what emboldens him to do the things he does without care of profit or success. </p>

<p>LOL what technology did you invent? what companies do you run? please share with us how you are smarter than Elon on a topic he is not only involved with but a front runner. his AI beat the best DOTA 2 player in the world, with its hands tied behind its back. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is my take on that video:</p>

<p>NASA was a political response to the Soviet union putting people in space, whether they faked it or not is irrelevant to that point. Did they go to the Moon? Maybe, I think they did. There is one thing that is not fake, satellites and evidence. Do you honestly believe that the earth is flat? How do you explain seasons? How do you explain the arctic and antarctic seasons and day/night cycles being so messed up? Honestly this flat earth theory is such bunk, your so stuck in 2 dimensions, a sphere is an elegant shape and it makes so much sense that earth is one.</p>

<p>Maybe MTV chose astronauts and shit cause its cool as fuck? Must be the illuminatus.</p>

<p>I almost stopped it half way through when he put up pics of flat earth. Almost turned it off when he was bringing up Aleister Crowly too, people misunderstand him and what he represented. Then they talk about propulsion in a vacuum? You do know they bring an oxidizer and fuel to create combustion in space right? Like basic Newtonian engineering here. </p>

<p>Rockets are obelisks? Magic? You know what real magic is, this right here if your reading it. I am affecting your consciousness right now, magic. God gave us the word, and with the word we can make the world exactly as we wish. </p>

<p>Wan&#39;t me to woke you? You should read a few books.</p>

<p>Here is one you should read first:</p>

<p>The Beginning of infinity by David Deutsch, </p>

<p>In that book he explains that good ideas, true ideas have reach. They work throughout the universe. The earth being a globe is one of them, it has reach. Mars is a globe, the sun is a globe and yes the moon is a globe. This idea has reach.</p>

<p>If you wan&#39;t to read something stranger, another one I recommend is Journeys out of the body by Robert Monroe. He was a rational man having weird you could say paranormal things happen to him. I have also had some strange occurrences and I do believe there is an afterlife, that we are in a simulation and that when you die it is not the end. This all came from personal revaluations, not watching YouTube videos.</p>

<p>I think we have this idea that there is a group of elites who know what they are doing and is in control because it makes us feel good about it, like some big daddy in control of everything. Just like ancient religions, to me all he pointed out where interesting coincidences or synchronicity as you could say. If you wish to learn more about those do some research on Carl Jung and his ideas, I do believe magic is real, but it&#39;s simple, its called love. That&#39;s the secret to magic. If you wan&#39;t I can talk to you about demons too, since the video started out with the Lord Satan affecting children, what all good Christians fear most.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am going to right up something on demons too, since the video started out with a good dose of fear mongering to Christians. We still have a hard time with these &quot;monsters&quot;.</p>

<p>The word demon comes from the greek word Daemon.  </p>

<p>From wiki:</p>

<p><strong>Daemon</strong> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin">Latin</a> word<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(classical_mythology">[1]</a>#cite<em>note-1)[[2]](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon</a></em>(classical<em>mythology)#cite_note-2) for the Ancient Greek <strong>daimon</strong> (δαίμων: &quot;god&quot;, &quot;godlike&quot;, &quot;power&quot;, &quot;fate&quot;), which originally referred to a lesser deity or guiding spirit; the daemons of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_religion">ancient Greek religion</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology">mythology</a> and of later <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_religion">Hellenistic religion</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_philosophy">philosophy</a>.[[3]](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon</a></em>(classical_mythology)#cite_note-3) </p>

<p>A guiding spirit, I do believe these are real. From our ancient religions to modern day UFO sightings, I think they are daemons here to guide us or tricksters here to mess with us. Not sure yet. If you are interested in this google Mercurial Hermeneutics. </p>

<p>The best book to read on this subject would be Prometheus and Atlas by Jason Reza Jorjani. He points out that there is a world technological force that is changing society at such a rapid pace, it is forcing old cultures to either adapt or die and this technological force is explained by the myths of Prometheus and Atlas, the giver of fire and the one who holds the world in place. He calls for a spectral revolution to take place, the paranormal isn&#39;t so out of the ordinary in context to most religions and UFO stories. I do believe that technology will bring forth a sort of apocalypse, don&#39;t confuse this with a world ending catastrophe more of a revelation through technology.</p>

<p>Definition:</p>

<p>An <strong>apocalypse</strong> (Ancient Greek: ἀποκάλυψις apokálypsis, from ἀπό and καλύπτω, literally meaning &quot;an uncovering&quot;) is a disclosure of knowledge or revelation. </p>

<p>So there is something to be said about the Daemons and technology changing the human spirit, or revealing it to us.</p>

<p>Could there be Demons running things? Possible, the lizard people? Maybe, I doubt they care that much about us. I think it&#39;s more simple than that, humans are the demons running amok, we are the gods and demons in charge. The lizard is just the lizard brain still in control of our actions. This could be offensive to actual lizard people though so I apologize to any of you reading this now. :D</p>

<p>Have you seen the podcast, he can&#39;t act. He maybe a bad actor in the other sense of the word but I&#39;d still probably have to say they both seem to be men going about their own agenda. As most do/are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one thinks fake news is brand new, we always had slanted and skewed news reporting and even worse we have one network who covers one side of the spectrum and then the rest of them are more in the middle but they seem very left leaning because there&#39;s not multiple right wing focused networks.</p>

<p>The entire conglomerate issue should have been brought up sooner than now though. I hate how any change coming to the media is gonna be because it was already to late but better to get the press back late than never. </p>

<p>MSM is fine but they as well as other business industries need to allow Independent companies to exist.. we need more PBS, NPR, AP news and we really need to educate our people beyond schools. Schools need to do better but it&#39;s disheartening to see how often people stop studying and they lose most of their curiosity or desire to keep up with knowledge and information and slowly stop thinking for themselves and start grabbing the talking points they agree with from TV. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. Agreed. But, having worked in and studied extensively international issues, it seems to me that there is a wide enough difference between scholarship, realities on the ground, etc, and coverage by western media, that it is likely propaganda.  This is most true on war and foreign policy. Many scholars and journalists from Seymour Hersh to Glenn Greenwald and Noam Chomsky agree on this point. Many factual examples of fake news and propaganda. </p>

<p>This is why people blindly defending media empires because they are at odds with Trump is misinformed at best.</p>

<p>I have also said conglomeration in mass media is not okay and it creates news entertainment networks which are plagued by all the problems you detail. </p>

<p>I agree, I dont want to defend the current media and I even mentioned that we need to get control of the press back as a people. </p>

<p>Does the international community have no MSM? It&#39;s just not owned by like 4 to 6 parent companies who also own part of just about everything else in the US collectively. We have a major problem forsure but i dont really think it&#39;s all on the media... People got lazy, people got comfy and people have been subjected to a massive conspiracy or conspiracies that have definitely been propagated by the conglomerated media empires but they exist because of bigger failures by people long dead. </p>
