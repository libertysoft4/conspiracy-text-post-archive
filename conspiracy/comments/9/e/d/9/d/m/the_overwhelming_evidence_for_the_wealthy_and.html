        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My main argument is going to be that we already have proof of elite customers purchasing expensive blood transfusions with teen or young adult blood, but that this is just the tip of the iceberg. It has both been going on for decades and there are most likely other blood transfusion operations out there. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But it’s no longer an experiment with just mice. The startup company by Jesse Karmazin, Ambrosia, is doing this with humans, and the rich are lining up to get the blood of the young.</p>

<p>As Vanity Fair reports, Ambrosia, which buys its blood from blood banks, now has about 100 paying customers. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://thefreethoughtproject.com/elite-ingesting-blood-conspiracy/">https://thefreethoughtproject.com/elite-ingesting-blood-conspiracy/</a></p>

<p>And this: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ambrosia currently offers teenage blood plasma to older customers at a cost of $8,000 (£6,200) for two and a half litres.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/drinking-young-blood-could-prevent-age-related-diseases-study-reveals-11493276">https://news.sky.com/story/drinking-young-blood-could-prevent-age-related-diseases-study-reveals-11493276</a></p>

<p>The cost of the transfusions is going to limit this to only wealthy elite customers, and it would be naive to think that this is the only young blood transfusion operation out there for elite customers. This has probably been going on for a long time. </p>

<p>The elite are also clearly interested in this. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tony Wyss-Coray, a researcher at Stanford leading the work, says that if it works he hopes to isolate factors in the blood that drive the effect and then try to make a drug that does a similar thing. (Since publishing his work in mice, many “healthy, very rich people” have contacted Wyss-Coray wondering if it might help them live longer.)</p>

<p>Evidence this has probably been going on for decades:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1924, Bogdanov started his blood transfusion experiments, apparently hoping to achieve eternal youth or at least partial rejuvenation. Lenin&#39;s sister Maria Ulyanova was among many who volunteered to take part in Bogdanov&#39;s experiments. After undergoing 11 blood transfusions, he remarked with satisfaction on the improvement of his eyesight, suspension of balding, and other positive symptoms. His fellow revolutionary Leonid Krasin wrote to his wife that &quot;Bogdanov seems to have become 7, no, 10 years younger after the operation&quot;. In 1925–1926, Bogdanov founded the Institute for Haemotology and Blood Transfusions, which was later named after him. But a later transfusion cost him his life, when he took the blood of a student suffering from malaria and tuberculosis.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an urban legend that started right from when she was placed under house arrest by the authorities, and it continues to this very day in eastern Europe.</p>

<p>Her aristocratic family had a lot of enemies among the patrician class, and when they found out about her murders, they were overjoyed. They <em>easily</em> exaggerated her misdeeds, spreading anecdotes among the plebeian class.</p>

<p>She was certainly into the female version of pederasty, as well as an extreme version of BDSM.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From a link another user has provided, there is another very old example of this &quot;young blood transfusion for slowing aging&quot; thing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fledgling years of the Royal Society, founded in London in 1660, witnessed some of the earliest experiments in blood transfusion. When Robert Boyle, one of the society’s founders, compiled a wishlist of scientific projects, the top entry was “The prolongation of life”. That might be achieved, he hoped, by replacing old blood with new.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They didn&#39;t know anything about blood types, genetics, etc. That&#39;s why I think the earliest this was going on in a widespread fashion was maybe mid 20th century when the science was good enough to make sure they wouldn&#39;t have crazy complications from the transfusions. </p>

<p>Before that, there was probably some experimentation with it and a lot of failure. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The more money you have, the healthier you are and the longer you live, according to a new study from the Urban Institute crunching data from the Centers for Disease Control.</p>

<p>The study divides Americans into five income groups and finds that each income group is healthier than the one below it and sicker than the one above it.</p>

<p>And that outcome is remarkably consistent. Bloomberg’s John Tozzi points out that in almost every category of ailment, from heart disease to arthritis to kidney disease to strokes, prevalence drops almost in lock step as income rises. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I particularly enjoyed this bit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wyss-Coray is not the first person to wonder whether the answer to the problem of ageing might lie in human blood. One of the first physicians to propose blood transfusions to rejuvenate older people was Andreas Libavius, a German doctor and alchemist. In 1615 he proposed connecting the arteries of an old man to those of a young man. He had high hopes for the procedure. “The hot and spirituous blood of the young man will pour into the old one as if it were from a fountain of youth, and all of his weakness will be dispelled,” he claimed, in an account told in the Textbook of Bloodbanking and Transfusion Medicine by Sally Rudmann. It is unclear how it turned out; there is no record of the transfusion happening.</p>

<p>The fledgling years of the Royal Society, founded in London in 1660, witnessed some of the earliest experiments in blood transfusion. When Robert Boyle, one of the society’s founders, compiled a wishlist of scientific projects, the top entry was “The prolongation of life”. That might be achieved, he hoped, by replacing old blood with new.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The teen blood doesn&#39;t do much. Like I said, it&#39;s a temporary fix. It&#39;s like putting a bandaid on. It doesn&#39;t do much. You have to fix the cause of the aging, not just temporarily treat the symptoms. And on top of that, the blood only works at most, 24 hours and only makes someone feel minimally better. Maybe better libido. But that&#39;s pretty much it. They&#39;re still old as fuck.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The more money you have, the healthier you are and the longer you live, according to a new study from the Urban Institute crunching data from the Centers for Disease Control.</p>
