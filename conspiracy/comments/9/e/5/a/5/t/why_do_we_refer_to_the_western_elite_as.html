    <div class="md"><p>Because there&#39;s a difference.</p>

<p>Billionaires and entrepreneurs have, for the most part, earned their wealth, regardless of the dodgy deals and tax evasion tactics they used.</p>

<p>Russian oligarchs did not earn their wealth. After the USSR collapsed, all the previously state-run and state-owned companies, factories, buildings, land, etc... were given away to prominent communist party members.</p>

<p>If you know anything of the USSR and Soviet block, you&#39;d know that being a &quot;prominent&quot; party member means you had to have been extremely corrupt, have mob connections, close links to the KGB/secret police, lived on bribes, etc, etc...</p>

<p>This is why multi-billionaire mobsters like Sergey Veremeenko, who were given large swathes of USSR land and property due to friendships they built up by helping assassinate enemies of the communist regime, are called oligarchs, not billionaires.</p>

<p>The answer to your question is literally the first result when searching &quot;define Russian oligarch&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Russian oligarchs are business oligarchs of the former Soviet republics who rapidly accumulated wealth during the era of Russian privatization in the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the 1990s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure it fits a narrative. Plainly. </p>

<p>Just because there are &quot;Russian oligarchs&quot; and they are the baddest oligarchs in the known universe does not mean there cannot be just plain &quot;oligarchs&quot; or some other type of &quot;adjective oligarchs&quot; in America.</p>

<p>Existence of a &quot;Russian oligarchy&quot; != there can be no other oligarchy.</p>

<p>In fact, the American oligarchy was partially broken up in the early 20th Century. It has reformed since Ronald Reagan. Today, as we can tell by consolidation, distribution of wealth and income, the rising class of billionaires, and of course, the deregulation of campaigning, the oligarchy is back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a reason why the modern Republican party wants to limit regulations, and doesn&#39;t support campaign finance laws. Look at which Supreme Court members passed Citizens United. Regulations often protect the consumer while costing corporations money. Corporations don&#39;t care about safety, only not getting caught. It is usually the role of the government to step in an play a bigger role as the voice of the people to enforce safety standards. Regulations are why we know what&#39;s in our food, that we get paid overtime, our water is (usually) safe to drink, and other things we take for granted today. Today&#39;s Republican party wants to get rid of these regulations, since they cut into the profits of companies. </p>

<p>I know this is an unpopular opinion here. I know corruption exists on both sides of the aisle. However, only the modern Democratic party seems to be doing anything about lessening corruption in the government while the modern Republican party covers it up. Why do we have a Republican trying to privatize the War in Afghanistan (see Erik Prince)? Why are Republicans for private prisons (equivalent of modern day slavery)? Why are Republicans for deregulating Wall Street and for the spread of White Collar crime? </p>

<p>Bull-fucking-shit.<br/>
What excessive regulations do is create government sanctioned oligopolies but allowing the first few companies to break all the rules then slam anyone that comes along later with an impossible to breach regulatory burden.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a difference between regulations and excessive regulations. And I did say often, and not always for a reason.</p>

<p>Regulations are why we can put up a stink when we find arsenic in our chicken. Regulations are why we no longer have lead in paint. Regulations are why you don&#39;t get rotten meat in the grocery store. Regulations are why you know milk is milk and not cut with things to make it white. </p>

<p>Again, this is an unpopular opinion. However, I would argue that if you start looking deeper at regulations, they often benefit the consumer. And yes there is an issue with enforcement, as many large companies can just eat the cost over actually implementing the regulations. They are going for what is cheaper for them. This re-enforces the profit over safety with companies I was getting at. Remember companies don&#39;t give a fuck about me or you, not about their workers, only the shareholders and their bottom line. It is up to us, as voices of our government to hold them responsible. Remember, WE are the government, and should try to make sure it works for all of our interests</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conflating helpful regulation with excessive regulation caused by regulatory capture is the most common Republican tactic to fight against their use.</p>

<p>If they cared about regulatory capture even the slightest bit they would be putting laws in place to shield the agencies from outside influence and lobbyists. Instead when they take control they immediately bend to the will of these corporations and run the government like crony capitalists. You can see that in this administration most clearly.</p>

Some (a lot) here simply don&#39;t hold foreign leaders to the same standard that they do their own. Can you imagine if a U.S. politician had the resume, the wealth, the connections that Putin has?

<p>I agree, but it&#39;s also important to keep in mind that Russia has about 1/13th the GDP that the US has, and yet spends more per GDP on their military than the US, and they have <em>certainly</em> been involved in their fair share of unnecessary and moronic military conflicts (Syria, Ukraine, Georgia, Turkey??)</p>

<p>This is true, but how is this relevant? Russia&#39;s military budget was 66.3 billion in 2017 and the US&#39;s was 610 billion. The only other country that comes close is China with a &quot;measly&quot; 228 billion.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s also compare the number of military bases around the world.</p>

<p><a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2015/12/19/challenging-us-overseas-military-bases/">https://consortiumnews.com/2015/12/19/challenging-us-overseas-military-bases/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, the United States empire has over 800 U.S. military installations around the world. In his excellent, recently released book Base Nation: How U.S. Military Bases Abroad Harm America and the World, David Vine documents that even after hundreds of bases in Iraq and Afghanistan have been closed, the U.S. still has bases ranging in size from mega “Little Americas” to small radar facilities in more than 80 countries.</p>

<p>The United States has 95 percent of the world’s foreign bases. Although few Americans realize it, but certainly people outside the U.S. do, the United States likely has more bases in foreign lands than any other people, nation or empire in history. Currently, the United States has about half as many bases as it had in 1989, but the number of countries with U.S. bases has roughly doubled from 40 to 80. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Other countries have a combined total of about 30 foreign bases. Great Britain has seven bases and France five bases in their former colonies. Russia has eight military bases in the former Soviet republics and one in Syria.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>and they have certainly been involved in their fair share of unnecessary and moronic military conflicts (Syria, Ukraine, Georgia, Turkey??).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Syria: Came in at the invitation of Assad after the US and its allies initiated a proxy war there. However, there certainly has been collateral damage from their bombs which they should rightly be criticized for.</p>

<p>Ukraine: If you&#39;re talking about Crimea, <a href="http://www.aalep.eu/legitimate-case-recognition-crimea">the referendum was considered legitimate and had 150 international observers.</a></p>

<p>This also happened <em>after</em> the US and NATO-funded regime change operation in Ukraine. <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2016/03/18/behind-the-crimearussia-reunion/">Ray McGovern wrote an excellent article on this as well.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>As for Russia’s alleged designs on Crimea, one searches in vain for evidence that, before the coup, the Kremlin had given much thought to the vulnerability of the peninsula and a possible need to annex it. According to the public record, Putin first focused on Crimea at a strategy meeting on Feb. 23, the day after the coup.</p>

<p>Yet, given the U.S. mainstream media’s propagandistic reporting on the Ukraine crisis, it is small wonder that the American people forgot about (or never heard of) the putsch in Kiev. The word “coup” was essentially banished from the U.S. media’s lexicon regarding Ukraine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I continued, explaining that, with respect to Russia’s “invasion,” what you don’t see in the “mainstream media” is that, a treaty between Ukraine and Russia from the late 1990s allowed Russia to station up to 25,000 Russian troops on the Crimean peninsula. There were 16,000 there, when a U.S.-led coup ousted the democratically elected government in Kiev on Feb. 22, 2014. (I had grabbed the attention of the audience; yet stares of incredulity persisted.)</p>

<p>In contrast to Crimea’s bloodless political secession from Ukraine, the Ukrainian government’s “anti-terror operation” against ethnic Russians in the east who resisted the coup authorities in Kiev has killed an estimated 10,000 people, many of them civilians. Yet, in the mainstream U.S. media, this carnage is typically blamed on Putin, not on the Ukrainian military which sent to the front neo-Nazi and other right-wing militias (such as the Azov battalion) contemptuous of ethnic Russians. [See Consortiumnews.com’s “Ukraine Merges Nazis and Islamists.”]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The jingoistic process also requires a careful rewriting of history. Thus, in reporting and commentary on Ukraine, the 2008 Russo-Georgian War provides a handy anti-Russian talking point…if you leave out half the story.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, Georgia started the war with a large-scale military attack on Russian peacekeeping forces and separatist militias in the breakaway Georgian  province of South Ossetia, according to an European Union-commissioned report on the war (Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia, 9/30/09). Georgia’s initial attack  killed at least 10 Russian peacekeepers and an unrecorded number of South Ossetians. (Pursuant to a local treaty, Russian peacekeepers were in the two Georgian breakaway provinces, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, as part of the Joint Peacekeeping Task Force, which had Georgian peacekeepers protect other parts of the breakaway regions.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, they were given it by the US and our puppet, Yeltsin. The oligarchs hate Putin for the most part and most live abroad, a huge number in Sunny Isles, FL, also London. They hate Putin for the same reason we do, he has from the beginning been re-nationalizing Russia&#39;s natural resources. </p>

<p>That oligarch recently in the news,  who was targetted for the the Manafort case, was pretty classic example  of the stalemate relationship the oligarchs have with Putin. They have to work with him but they hate him. They also use Putin to triangulate against each other. Russians are too paranoid to unite in monopolies and trusts. even informally.  Nobody trusts anybody. It is actually a pretty good check on absolute power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What exactly are you replying to?</p>

<p>Firstly, like most of the replies to my comment, this has absolutely nothing to do with the topic. </p>

<p>OP asked what the difference was, and I answered: billionaires in the west gained (if you prefer that over &quot;earned&quot;) their wealth through their own shady deals and by exploiting the population. Whereas Russian oligarchs flat out stole huge swaths of the counties wealth <em>when it was being privatised during the decline of the Soviet union</em>. </p>

<p>Did the Koch brothers make their money during the fall of the American empire while it was selling off all the old communist state run assets? Did Jeff Bezos? No? Neat, then that&#39;s completely off topic. </p>

<p>Secondly, I&#39;m not a capitalist apologist, which is why I said <em>for the most part</em>. I&#39;m well aware of the stupidity, corruption, and huge gulf in political power that comes out of a pure capitalist system.</p>

<p>I&#39;m well aware of how the political wishes of the top 1% are what actually matters and what actually affect policy. </p>

<p>And personally I far prefer the economic model of Scandinavian countries which strikes a good balance between personal economic freedom and security.</p>

<p>But I didn&#39;t mention any of this because <strong>it&#39;s completely off topic and has nothing to do with OP&#39;s question</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russians are a sanguine, laconic, unsentimental people. They call spades spades. Also, the ousted communist party bosses deliberately reminded everyone of the reason for the revolution in the first place--to topple a brutal, absolute monarchy, aristocracy, and caste system. </p>

<p>All aristocrats are oligarchs, but not all oligarchs a aristocrats. The 21st century Russian oligarchs are not hereditary aristocrats, but declasse, bourgeois, business class grifters and thugs, whose power is akin to mafia bosses. So calling them aristocrats is false, but calling the oligarchs is true. They aren&#39;t even capitalists really,  though they do now receive unearned income from renting money (capitalists are rentiers). </p>

<p>Their relationship with Putin is very similar to that between the Czar and his aristocracy. Knives are always at the ready, even if smiles are on the faces. And their relationship with each other is also knives behind smiles, and everyone in Russia knows this even though we don&#39;t. We are naive. We see the smiles, only.</p>

<p>Capitalist oligarchs have run this country since it was founded as a collection of profit seeking investments. The pilgrams almost starved because they defaulted on their &quot;loan.&quot; Their charter company investors withheld supplies, because the pilgrams didn&#39;t have the pelts they were contractually obligated to provide. Likewise for Jamestown.</p>

<p>Our flag is the battle flag of the British East India Company. The 13 stripes had nothing to do with the number of colonies (their were actually 14), they were already there. We didn&#39;t remove the the Union Jack in the upper left corner until the 1790s, replacing it with stars on a field of blue. Betsy Ross is apocryphal. The flag Washington fought under was the BEIC (go check out the famous Crossing the Delaware painting). The BEIC flag flew over all statehouses but South Carolina, Florida (the forgotten 14th colony), Rhode Island, and Maryland. Our blue uniforms were the BEIC&#39;s uniforms (the BEIC had the most powerful army and navy at the time, and basically owned India).</p>

<p>Once Hamilton won the fight over Jefferson, combined with calvinist notions of god&#39;s elect being identified by material wealth and the puritan work ethic and belief that if you were poor it was your own fault later to be reinforced with social Darwinism, and it was a fait accomplee. We accepted our oligarchs as a consequnce of natural processes, not power-seeking.</p>

<p>The difference between our oligarchs and Russia&#39;s is (1) there is no counterwieght, akin to Putin, (2) ours realized early on it was in their best interests to work to together than against each other, as the Russian oligarchs do, and (3) we were founded on a myth of democratic equality. Oligarchs are &quot;impossible&quot; in such a country (yet we always were a political oligarchy, because we are not, and never were, a democracy, we are a democratic republic). </p>

<p>Florida bounced back and forth between Spain and England and indepence, at the time of the Revolution we were British. We actually particpated in one of the biggest battles you&#39;ve never heard of united with the Spanish gov of LA.</p>

There are plenty of smart people in Russia and on the other hand I am sure some portion of businesses in Western countries are also corrupt, but I think it is different. Does any of you remember when some high level politician in Illinois wanted to sell his seat to someone else and got caught. In Russia&#39;s reality at that time, all politicians were so confused, because this poor guy asked only 200k for it. Meanwhile high level corrupt Russian politicians were buying a pen that cost like 200k...</p>
