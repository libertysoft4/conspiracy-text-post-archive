    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m 29. I&#39;ve had a number of people close to me die in &quot;suspicious&quot; circumstances. One died at 18 from heart issues because she &quot;forgot&quot; to take her medication. Another died in a car accident straight out of Final Destination. One drowned in their pool during the middle of the day. </p>

<p>I could probably list fix or six more if I wanted to. People die and the circumstances don&#39;t always make sense. The older you get, and the more people you know, the larger that number will be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t recall many gunshot deaths in my circle. I had a middle school friend who was killed in a drive by that was supposedly intended for someone else.</p>

<p>Know a guy who was t-boned at an intersection while riding his motorcycle.</p>

<p>ex boyfriend&#39;s dad was killed when a nurse gave him an &quot;accidental overdose&quot; of pain medications following surgery.</p>

<p>Two years ago a friend got hit by a train.</p>

<p>It is pretty ridiculous that you don&#39;t believe deaths like these happen on a regular basis. I&#39;m 29. She&#39;s 70-years-old and has doubtlessly known several times as many people that I have.</p>

<p>a few</p>

<p>stabbings,</p>

<p>one that I can think of </p>

<p>plane crashes,</p>

<p>No one in my circle, but I am going to say that most of the people in my circle fly much less frequently than the people in the Clinton&#39;s circle. Now car crashes, that&#39;s a different story. I can think of two dozen easy who have died in car accidents, and one in an ATV accident.</p>

<p>and “suicide”?</p>

<p>More than a few, including some of the same people I remembered with your first hypothetical, gunshot wounds. </p>
