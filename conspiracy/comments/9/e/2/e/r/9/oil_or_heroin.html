    <div class="md"><p>The thing that&#39;s fucked up nowadays is that you&#39;ll find fentanyl in literally everything, not just heroin but in xanax, cocaine, etc. Which makes absolutely no sense because it gives you the opposite of the intended effect and nobody is gonna buy again from a dealer who laces shit. </p>

<p>Which is why I feel like the CIA or whoever is randomly lacing pills and coke and stuff that they sell on the dark web with fent. No dealer would knowingly put fent in xans unless he is a total scumbag, but it seems totally likely that he could buy a thousand on the dark web and have like 5 of them be laced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No doubt but fentanyl giving the opposite effect of Xanax? Stimulants maybe but not benzos. I mean as long as the person doesn&#39;t die it&#39;s not a direct contradiction I know benzos are gabaergics while opiates effect dopamine and obviously the opiod receptors, but they are calming and downers as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, it is a black swan effect coupled with latent raccism and overt classcism. White suburban kids from good families are od&#39;ing now, not just urban junkies in flop houses and poor blacks on the lower east side (back when Manhattan was a shithole).</p>

<p>The rate of addiction has not changed, it is still about 10%. The number of recorded od&#39;s has increased, but mostly because dead urban junkies are treated as dead garbage people, whose cause of death is of no interest. Also, junkies don&#39;t want to die, so they take measures to protect themselves. They don&#39;t shoot up alone, they have experienced junkies prep for them, their buddies have no qualms about dropping them off at the ER, and most of all they do not chase hot shots--heroine that is too pure (or now cut with things like stronger synthetic opiods). Dealers who get a reputation for hot shots get ostracized. If pure heroine starts flooding the streets, they get the word out, and hit the methadone clinics.</p>

<p>Sid Vicious was a classic example. Pure heroine had flooded Manhattan when he was let out but he didnt know, no one he knew was dealing due to the purity, he couldn&#39;t find his buddies, he was alone, and he took his normal strength. And he od&#39;d. </p>

<p>Suburban kids chase hotshots, shoot up alone, don&#39;t have any experienced users to prep for them, everyone they know is terrified to call 911 out of stigma and taint, and their deaths are seen as tragic and are recorded and make the news.</p>

<p>It seems more prevelant now, because it has a sympathetic victim population. And because it is a really easy political stump speech point. No one is against saving white suburban kids from being junkies.</p>

<p>The vast majority of people who shoot up do not become addicts. You have to work at being an addict, most get over that bullshit pretty fast. Those &quot;5 day&quot; ads are the new &quot;brains on drugs&quot; ads. Most people prescribed opiods never finish their bottle. People who desperately need opiods for chronic pain are not junkies. They are perfectly functional, upstanding members of society, at least they were, many can no longer get their medicine and are basically invalids from pain now.</p>

<p>I have fuck all sympathy to be honest.</p>

Look where those Middle Eastern insurgents were trained, and marvel at the coincidence that the Albanian mafia shortly after that coup turned into the biggest peddlers of heroin throughout Europe (and sex trafficking but that&#39;s a whole other rabbit hole). </p>

<p>When you overlay the heroin gang activity with NATO&#39;s military involvement you can see too much overlap to dismiss as mere coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>oil and heroin are valuable byproducts, pipelines even more so, but i think, it is fundamentally, global social engineering at its core. i think that it was to create this huge influx of radicalized muslim refugees in the west in order to create a right wing white supremacist reaction - a global fourth reich, and also to create a wave of antisemitism in the west, forcing the jews back into israel and out of the western countries and possibly a new holocaust.  the zionists are partners in this with the powers that shouldn&#39;t be.  otoh the middle eastern countries that undervent regime changes (arab spring) got all their secular governments replaced with authoritarian theocracies and isis - a western/templar/jesuit terror organization - filled up the power vacuum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to think the mass immigration was a Zionist plot.  Fill the west full of the more religious, less tolerant Muslims.  Then radicalise them by infiltrating the mosques, fund, encourage and carry out terrorist atrocities, then create laws preventing anyone from criticising the Islamic faith (pressure cooker effect).  </p>

<p>I thought it was all being done purposefully.  If they could force the world to loathe and despise Muslims to the extent they could murder them, this would allow the huge expansion of Israel.  It would see a great biblical Israel, wealthy beyond belief with the entire middle Eastern oil reserves and huge natural resources within this area.</p>

<p>Then, it all went on for too long.  In the UK at least, the hatred peaked around 5 years ago.  Now, the worst anyone really thinks of them is just apathy.  I haven&#39;t met anyone who hates Muslims for over a year.  It&#39;s actually having the opposite effect, I know more people becoming Muslims than opposing it.  If it was a Zionist plot, they fucked up.  </p>

<p>Sure, there are people who don&#39;t agree with some Islamic beliefs, but not many think they are beyond redemption.  There is even some reform of Islam in Britain, and British Muslims are beginning to see themselves as different from sub Saharan  and Arabic Muslims.</p>

<p>In fact, there is now far more real mistrust of Zionism than Islam.  Even on Reddit and the Chans this is obvious.</p>
