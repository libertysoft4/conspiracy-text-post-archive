    <div class="md"><p>So here in Ohio, we seem to have this cabal of business owners who feel like 13 to 15 dollars an hour is a living wage. Yes there is growth potential, but do the math, not everyone in these environments can make 80k a year through advancement in the same company.</p>

<p>Then we have other states that impose non-compete orders or restrictive covenants. I know alot folks who have been forced to leave a job that they have worked at for years and not be able to work anywhere else doing a similar job.</p>

<p>So in a way, they kind of are forced to stay, at an employer. I mean, because, they should just be thankful to have a job afterall. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These same manufacturing jobs paid well over 20 bucks an hour before there were mass layoffs and downsizings. That was 10 years ago, plus benefits.</p>

<p>People knowingly agreed? It doesn&#39;t work that way. You are forced to accept the deal you&#39;re agreeing to or you find another job. Even worse, as a skilled Craftsmen, once your salary hit certain levels, these companies would downsize and let them go. Who agreed on that?</p>

<p>How about these right to work states or employment at will? It all comes down to pushing people to accept these deals at non-competitvely low salaries. Even fast food stores do this.</p>

<p>When I say these businesses formed a cabal, all you have to do is hit the help wanted ads at all these manufacturing jobs and how, for some strange reason their starting hourly rates are almost identical. They can&#39;t fill jobs and yet their salaries aren&#39;t rising enough to bring in employees.</p>

<p>Hogwash. You think people are going to go homeless and watch their families starve while they refuse to go to work in the hope that will force higher wages? You think this is 1970&#39;s socialism with unions and collective bargaining or something!</p>

<p>The modern workplace is not a free market, it is a corporate monopolized environment that controls staffing levels to hold a level of unemployment that ensures someone will always agree to accept that low pay.</p>

There is an argument that the term slave does not necessarily fit into Ancient Egyptian culture, but rather it would be laborer or possibly serf.</p>

<p>But basically, we are all born to serve the Pharoah, who in turn provides for us. </p>

<p>Although the US is often compared to Rome and Greek life, in truth, we might be closer to Egypt in how the Overseers and Priests treat the workers. We are born to work and die for the Pharoah.</p>
