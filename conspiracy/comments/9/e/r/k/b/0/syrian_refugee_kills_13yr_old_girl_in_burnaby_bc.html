    <div class="md"><p>Public schools in Calgary, Canada are struggling to integrate often-violent Syrian migrants into the education system, according to internal documents from the Calgary Board of Education.</p>

<p>Obtained by news outlet The Rebel in a freedom of information request, the documents reveal a clash of cultures taking place in the region’s schools between Syrian students and Canadian students and teachers.</p>

<p>The documents show a pattern of threats and physical violence directed at Canadian children by the Syrian migrants, who have struggled to accept Canadian values of tolerance, gender equality and religious pluralism. School officials have struggled to keep the Syrian students from punching, slapping and even throwing rocks at the other students.</p>

<p>Girls aren’t exempt from the physical abuse, either.</p>

<p>In one email, an elementary school teacher noted the “rough treatment” a first grade girl has received from some of the Syrian boys. (RELATED: Canadian Newspaper Censors Refugee Abuse Of Elementary Students)</p>

<p>“We have basically decided to separate [the boys from the girls] because of our lack of success with mitigating the boys’ violent behavior,” the principal continued, before asking higher-ups for “some direction as to how I should proceed with this.”</p>

<p>In another email with the subject line “Comments of serious concern,” the principal noted that a first-grade Syrian boy, who — upon finding out his teacher was not a Muslim — said, “You guys don’t believe in God so it would be better to kill you.”</p>

<p>Similarly, a middle school principal wrote to the board, “Some of the boys in our Syrian student cohort are setting up conflict based on religious beliefs. I propose a system-created way of responding to this, and of teaching our cultural values. It’s very sensitive — we are un-teaching foundational beliefs.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The latter, but that&#39;s beside the point, as that is not being done either. They &#39;integrated&#39; them in the schools and made the assumption that it would all work out. Well, turns out the right was right and it doesn&#39;t work out, because these kids have parents that have given them different values.</p>

<p>I mean, look at this from the kids perspective. You&#39;ve been taught that there is a god, that he&#39;s almighty and vengeful, and you come into a country where by all counts the succesful people are the least devout. This shakes their worldview right to the core, and there are only two ways out: One is the western way of acknowledging religion is personal and respecting people for not believing. The other one is doubling down. The problem is that everyone around these people when they&#39;re not in school is pushing them to double down. Imam&#39;s, parents, syrian friends, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This all sounds pretty speculative. Muslims have been immigrating to the west for decades with no real problems. I think it&#39;s westerners who are fearful because they hate Islam so much, and rightfully so, but most of the people are fine. A couple of schools who have to rethink their education strategy to meet everyone&#39;s needs does not equate to &quot;we were right, the refugees are super dangerous.&quot;</p>

<p>Canada is a Commonwealth realm, meaning that Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state. However, while several powers are the sovereign&#39;s alone, most of the royal constitutional and ceremonial duties in Canada are carried out by the Queen&#39;s representative, the Governor General,[2] as such, the Governor General is sometimes referred to as the de facto head of state.[3] </p>

<p>= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =</p>

<p>END QUOTE</p>

<p>I can assure you that when it comes to Syria, the hands that govern the Queen&#39;s Realm are red and dripping.</p>

<p>/ <em>Also, the fuck has</em> <strong><em>Florida</em></strong> <em>done to Syria?!</em></p>

All the alt-librals were just losing their shit about our current administration actually taking necessary measures to enforce our existing immigration laws that were put in place protect Americans and our economy from our own economic destabilization as a result of over-immigration. Our last 4 administrations have been anything but wary about that. And it&#39;s pretty clear the dire economic state we&#39;re now in because of their open ignorance to our illegal immigration and its destructive over burdening of the American taxpayers and our social welfare and healthcare systems. How many Americans are assaulted or killed by illegal immigrant criminals and gang members each year? It&#39;s a lot more than in most of the other countries you constantly hear about in our MSM. Where is the MSM hysteria about our own foreign crime epidemic?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t understand how Islam expects the west to be completely tolerant of their ass backwards beliefs but Islam is easily the most intolerant religion on the planet. People need to wake the fuck up and realize that most of Islam’s culture (sharia law etc.) is not compatible with western way of life. I believe the conspiracy is that big government wants you to think that saying shit like this is being “islamophobic” when refugees continue to rape and pillage the west. </p>

<p>As it is, the US fucks up MENA countries, it creates a huge flow of refugees and the rest of the world (though mainly the EU) then has to deal with that. The best suggestion therefor is to stop MENA involvement.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Also, the fuck has Canada done to Syria?!&quot;</em></p>

<p>FYI...</p>

<p>[<strong>Canadian sovereignty</strong>(<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_sovereignty">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_sovereignty</a>)</p>

<p>QUOTE</p>

<p>= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =</p>

<p>Canada is a Commonwealth realm, meaning that Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state. However, while several powers are the sovereign&#39;s alone, most of the royal constitutional and ceremonial duties in Canada are carried out by the Queen&#39;s representative, the Governor General,[2] as such, the Governor General is sometimes referred to as the de facto head of state.[3] </p>

<p>= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =</p>

<p>END QUOTE</p>

<p>I can assure you that when it comes to Syria, the hands that govern the Queen&#39;s Realm are red and dripping.</p>

<p>/ <em>Also, the fuck has</em> <strong><em>Florida</em></strong> <em>done to Syria?!</em></p>
