<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/technology/twitter-alex-jones-infowars.html">Twitter said it would permanently suspend Mr. Jones’s account, as well as the account for Infowars. The social media company said Mr. Jones had posted messages within the previous 24 hours that violated its policies, which prohibit direct threats of violence and some forms of hate speech but allow deception or misinformation.</a></p>

<p>From the article. </p>

<p>&quot;Today&#39;s decision is remarkably narrow, and leaves for another day virtually all of the major constitutional questions that this case presented,&quot; said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. &quot;It&#39;s hard to see the decision setting a precedent</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Justice Kennedy wrote in his majority opinion: “The outcome of cases like this in other circumstances must await further elaboration in the courts, all in the context of recognizing that these disputes must be resolved with tolerance, without undue disrespect to sincere religious beliefs, and without subjecting gay persons to indignities when they seek goods and services in an open market.”</p>

<p>The Colorado commission&#39;s ruling was simply reversed, no new precedent was set with the SCOTUS&#39; opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those four companies are huge and PR matters.  I didn&#39;t mean Twitter and the app store.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re telling me that three companies decided to make a political stance in this climate in less than 12 hours?</p>

<p>So when company A bans one user do you really think that the bigwigs of the other three called emergency meetings that day and decided to make a big statement while receiving no pressure to do so?</p>

<p>Also, might I ask what major platforms still allow him?  This looks like a clean sweep.  What are the odds?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said I think each of those companies knew it would make bad press for banning him that might last a few days. </p>

<p>So once one of them did it the others immediately rode on the coattails of the first to decrease its visibility.</p>

<p>He still has a subreddit here and his own website with all his videos, not that I&#39;m defending him being deplatformed I think it just adds to his reputation unnecessarily. But I don&#39;t consider them banning him around the same time as proof that they agreed to do it together, just that they found it more convenient to do it that way.</p>

You notice how you were able to type that out, but you sensored yourself? Because you do recognize that you do have the freedom of speech and expression, however, you do not have the right of freedom of consequence, especially on a platform you do not own. You could register the domain name allwhitepeopleshoulddie.com (if it already exists I don&#39;t know) and type up all the racist shit you want all day long, and likely nobody would bother you.

    <div class="md"><p>Banning somebody&#39;s freedom of speech? Why does this have to be repeated so many times? &quot;Freedom of speech&quot; does not mean private companies are required to give you a platform to say whatever you want. It has never meant that; not even close.  </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Second, Twitter and YouTube ban people _all the time_. Just because he&#39;s high profile, doesn&#39;t make him above the rules. In fact, they probably gave him a pass on a lot of things, for a very long  time, because he had a following.  Rules shouldn&#39;t have asterisks after them that say &quot;If you don&#39;t have enough followers.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Slippery slope..... The conservatives FAVORITE fallacy.</p>

<p>They love using the slippery slope &quot;where does it end&quot; argument as if they have never heard of it being one of the most basic fallacies.</p>

<p>Look, I&#39;m sorry you feel attacked. But these platforms don&#39;t have to host you. They don&#39;t have to include you. They can be as private as they want. </p>

<p>That is THEIR RIGHT. </p>

<p>It&#39;s their fuckin company.... Not you town square. If you feel that butthurt about it, go start your own conservative-twitter or go on voat or whatever.</p>

<p>You wanna know what you conservatives are <em>really</em> upset about? It&#39;s that more and more people are <em>choosing</em> to not associate you. It&#39;s because you&#39;re becoming more and more socially isolated because your views and the company you keep/attract are becoming more and more reprehensible.</p>

<p>And you know what bugs you the most? </p>

<p>.... That places can exist without you. Without your input and without your participation. </p>

<p>I know how conservatives are. That fuckin kills you. I don&#39;t know why, but it does. I&#39;ve noticed it and I&#39;ve been taking note of that little quirk for years. </p>

<p>Conservatives have this compulsion, this <em>need</em> to have attention. I noticed it when all r_the donald did their little stomping out tantrum. I noticed it whenever ANY right wing sub gets butthurt and claims &quot;they&#39;re leaving Reddit&quot; or &quot;they&#39;re leaving so and so platform&quot; .... But they never do. </p>

<p>Come on now. If you&#39;re so up in arms about it, why do you stay? If you hate twitter or tumblr or youtube or facebook or google or reddit so much.... Why tf are you still here? This is <em>completely</em> voluntary. This is not a need. This is not even a public utility. You can live your whole life without them. </p>

<p>If what you want is a law to make everyone accept you and talk to you and play with you, just grow some balls and say so. Stop with these sob stories about free speech when we all fuckin know your communities are some of the most censored places on the web. </p>

<p>Also... YOU WERE ALL JUST CHEERLEADING FOR THE END OF NET NEUTRALITY. Get outta here with this stuff, jesus allah christ</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m of the opinion that this is exactly what he&#39;s wanted to happen for a while now. Alex makes his money playing the underdog, so since he hitched himself to trump, he&#39;s had to walk a fine line of presenting to his audience that they&#39;re both winning and in a tie game at the same time. High stakes sell, and always being ahead means the stakes are never as high. </p>

<p>His whole career he&#39;s been against whoever is president.  He tries to claim he gave Obama a chance, when in reality he was already working on <em>The Obama Deception</em> before he took office. </p>

<p>Getting kicked off of platforms is a very convenient way for him to slip back in to the underdog role, since his guy is in power. You can only pretend to be in a &quot;tie game&quot; for so long when the side you&#39;re supporting controls all branches of the government. </p>
