        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First and second wave feminism, the temperance movement and the suffragette movement are very different from what Gloria Steinem promoted in the 1960&#39;s. </p>

<p>Gloria Steinem was CIA and feminism was used to put a wedge in the family while at the same time drive down wages destroying the union movement with the addition of so many million workers.</p>

<p>Feminism is the cause of much of the hardships of our common era. High divorce rates, stagnant wages, </p>

<p>One man could at one time support a family of ten off of one wage. My grandfather worked for the railroad as a switchman and had enough to send three of his children, the ones who wanted to go, to college. And that&#39;s in the 1960&#39;s. This is now impossible.</p>

<p>Inflation and usury coupled with the destructive force of feminism have brought our once great nation to its knees.</p>

<p>If you are foolish enough to think women taking on the roles of men is liberation then you are very ignorant of situation. To think women need to be free by evening a wage is to ignore the reality of freedom. Freedom is self sufficiency.</p>

<p>a bit of anecdotal evidence... went to school in new england. in middle school, early nineties, there was a girl that belonged to one of the romani families that do paving on the east coast. she was a beautiful, sweet girl with big blue eyes and jet black hair. she wore expensive outfits from new york, but was very humble. her father found out she was &quot;fraternizing&quot; with boys in school. he shaved her head, sent her to school like that for about and month... and then she was pulled from school entirely. religious and cultural beliefs can be a motherfucker. </p>

<p>Nope.  Then you started a second subthread referencing the constitution.  You then failed to clarify which constitution you meant and went on a rather twisty path so as to leave it unclear as to what you meant.</p>

<p>Wages were increasing while the labor force had an increase participation of women. </p>

<p>In this graph you can see the trend of women entering the workforce since the end of the the second world war. </p>

<p>Wages continued to increase until the 1970&#39;s at which point real income became stagnant. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/ib330-productivity-vs-compensation/">https://www.epi.org/publication/ib330-productivity-vs-compensation/</a></p>

<p>Your whole narrative rests on a misguided application of supply and demand as being a determinant of wages, and weaving a tale where an increase in supply of workers brings down wages.  In the real world, this is not how this works.  Wages are moments of class struggle and are determined on how strong the working class is in its bargaining power.  Inclusion of women into early militant labor movements was one of the reasons why we got the eight hour working day, the weekend, and higher wages.   To grasp the role women played in the early labor movement, we need to grasp a few facts about their participation, prior to WW2.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the 1880s wage work for many women was a fact of life. From 1870 to
1910 the proportion of women &quot;engaged in gainful occupations&quot; steadily
increased from 14 percent to over 20 percent. This general figure, however,
masked the specific importance of women&#39;s work for particular communities
or industries. In some areas, few if any women worked outside their own
homes, while elsewhere the figures far exceeded the national average. In 1880,
for example, women constituted 26 percent of Philadelphia&#39;s workers, 34
percent of the workers in Fall River, Massachusetts, and 35 percent of the work
force in Atlanta, Georgia. Women&#39;s work-force participation depended largely
on local employment opportunities. Areas with major concentrations of textile
mills or clothing industries employed the largest numbers of women. In Philadelphia
women made up 46 percent of the city&#39;s textile industry while in Fall
River the figure approached 50 percent. Except for two textile cities, Lowell
and Lawrence, Massachusetts, Atlanta had the highest percentage of employed
women because of exceptional numbers of domestic servants, most of whom
probably were black. In contrast, centers of heavy industry such as Chicago or
Pittsburgh held fewer opportunities for women&#39;s employment. In Chicago
women constituted only 19 percent of the work force, 42 percent of them
working as servants and another 34 percent in the clothing industry. Clearly
the significance of women&#39;s work varied according to local circumstances.
Nonetheless, in particular communities and specific industries, women&#39;s
wage work had become a central feature of Gilded Age life. </p>

<p>So the whole story of the high paid male worker whose wages are depressed because women enter the workforce because of feminism is a fable.  </p>

<p>As for who is actually interested in destroying the society we live in...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our movement will be entirely destructive, and entirely constructive. We will not try to reform the existing institutions. We only intend to weaken them, and eventually destroy them. We will endeavor to knock our opponents off-balance and unsettle them at every opportunity. All of our constructive energies will be dedicated to the creation of our own institutions.</p>

<p>That is by Eric Heubeck, who wrote, The Integration of Theory and Practice: A Program for the New Traditionalist Movement, a manual  Paul Weyrich had him write.   Projection is strong on the paleo-conservative, fascist right!</p>
