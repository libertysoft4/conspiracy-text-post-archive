        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When&#39;s the last time you relied on a public source for news/information? Oh? Most of all of your news and information comes from privately owned social media, websites and broadcasting stations? How do you know it&#39;s free of bias and uncensored? Private corporations dont have to honor the first amendment and might and can censor information we receive. Even select, public news like NPR can withhold information or publish a biased story, because public is in the name does not mean they dont have an agenda to push. Will there even be a Conspiracy subreddit in 10, 20 years? Can other countries freely browse conspiracy theories?..</p>

<p>How unhappy do you feel if you&#39;re unable to buy something you want and are you happy when your needs are met? Do you think you need to upgrade something that is currently functioning as intended? Do you dream of luxury items or feel like you could have a bigger house or better things? Why does it seem that feeling discontent is tied in with our media outlets? Everyone is happy at their core, yet we continually are told otherwise. Silly, isnt it? Can you really live a wretched life with a warm bed and full belly, friends and family in tow and healthy? But why do so many of you seem to focus on the rich, and how toiling away, meeting your needs and living your life is so.. unfulfilling? </p>

<p>Why do so many people think like this? It&#39;s all connected, obviously media and advertising, but there is something more sinister at play. Almost as if a ghostly hand is lording over us, and not at a deep state or illuminati level either; it is fairly plain to see how we are being manipulated. It&#39;s right in front of us. This is why conspiracy theorists are sometimes labeled crazy, unstable or paranoid. </p>

<p>Because there&#39;s no conspiracy. This isnt even getting into the medical field, this isnt getting into our education or prison system. There are people influencing my whole country to be unhappy when happiness is at every human&#39;s core.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Infowars and prison planet huh?</p>

<p>I think something happened there. Around the time we had the massive swine flu outbreak back around 2010 I believe it coincided with President obamas trip to Mexico city which was ground zero for the outbreak. Prison Planet ran a lot of stories tracking the out break and degrees of mutation of the strains then all of a sudden it just dropped everything.</p>

<p>I really want to know why they just walked away from what seemed like a huge story.</p>

<p>It looked like they were on the path to proving the initial outbreak was man made before it mutated to a less lethal version. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch how to get down voted :) </p>

<p>I was an npr listener and supporter for about 8-10 years as I felt it was an excellent source of news and information. This was about the time foxnews and CNN went all propaganda. </p>

<p>I know Npr always had a liberal bias but during the last election they become full blown anti Trump pro Hillary. I was kind of surprised at how blatantly bias their reports and programs become and have not listened since. </p>

<p>I take a healthy dose of BBC world and BBC America then try to find the truth somewhere in the middle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t agree more. I&#39;m single and don&#39;t have people over very often.</p>

<p>I have 2 of each silverware a couple plates and 4-5 glasses .
I go over to a friends house who is also single yet he has a set of 10 of everything...it&#39;s ridiculous.
Less is more to keep my life in order...</p>

<p>Clutter and useless shit just take up space.
I&#39;m in the process of saving up for a mid size RV. I&#39;ve always wanted to visit all 50 states and am tired of the rat race.</p>

<p>The first time I realized just how special our country is was camping in the Smoky Mountains. I spent 3 days on each side (TN-NC) and I had a religious experience.</p>

<p>I highly recommend taking a trip by yourself. There is something about walking through the streams, hiking new trails and encountering bears, deer and other wildlife by yourself its invigorating and special.</p>

<p>One thing to take seriously if you are going to venture out by yourself is to bring along a GPS and let people know where you are going and when you expect to be back.
Make a waypoint for each mile traveled and send it off to a designated friend every so often so if you happen to have your scalp ripped off by a mother bear they know where to send help.</p>

<p>Peace and love y&#39;all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the majority of human lives in this world are consumed by simply trying satisfy their most basic needs and the pain and suffering of privation interferes with all the simple joys and pleasures they too should be able to have, while ours only come from being only slightly better off by working for a system that allows an elite of less than 10% of the population to own and hoard over 2/3rds of all the wealth and property there is on the planet and be the only ones who truly benefit from it, then I&#39;d say that&#39;s basically the underlying reason for our general discontent, wouldn&#39;t you?</p>

<p>We only work indirectly and peripherally to actually help one another in any real way while we focus all of our attention and efforts into working directly to help that 10% acquire even more wealth and property, which is another reason for our nagging discontent and general lack of satisfaction with even those simple joys we do manage to get out of life.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the last 60 years technology has changed dramatically. The internet has completely changed the world. It has created a fast pace world and everyone seems to be playing the rat race. Trying to be rich and powerful.
But I don&#39;t want more money. That means more things, which means more problems, creating more stress. Stress is a killer and I don&#39;t want to spread myself to thin. 
The media is mostly a twisted transcript pushing a political agenda, some form or another. I trust my local news network but it is obvious the national news is at least said in a way that pushes a political view point. Social media is crap. I suggest staying away from that.  This website is obviously push a political view point too. But all in all you have to make the decision in what you believe and you can be on the fence about something. And Fuck what other people think. Say what you want to. Words don&#39;t matter but actions do. 
I mostly second guess everything. I trying to view things in different perspectives and try and see both arguments. If I feel confident about oneside of and argument I stick to that, but It&#39;s never cut and dry.</p>
