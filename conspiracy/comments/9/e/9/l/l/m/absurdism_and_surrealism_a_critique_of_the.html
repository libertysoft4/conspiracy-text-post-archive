        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Absurdism and Surrealism: A Critique of the Philosophy of Modern Society</strong></p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>If you ever get a chance, watch the &quot;The Eric Andre Show&quot;, and you can see him destroy his desk absurdly. Watch the compilation here: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDVeuaWrgOA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDVeuaWrgOA</a></p>

<p>Or, watch any Rick and Morty episode for the common theme of &quot;nobody belongs anywhere, nobody exists on purpose, everybody&#39;s going to die:&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_qvy82U4RE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_qvy82U4RE</a></p>

<p>If that is the case, then no wonder people are protesting about Rick and Morty&#39;s mention of Szechuan dipping sauce at McDonald&#39;s:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/08/police-called-after-mcdonalds-rick-and-morty-promotion-heats-up">https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/08/police-called-after-mcdonalds-rick-and-morty-promotion-heats-up</a></p>

<p>What do these situations have in common? They are all promoting the absurd and chaotic, as well as reinforcing the belief that nothing really matters. The Eric Andre Show is funny (at least in my opinion), but I feel like we are reaching almost the &quot;end&quot; of humor. After absurdism, what is there? Rick and Morty is also well-written, but it is dark and nihilistic and sends a message to fans that you really mean nothing. Further, I find it completely absurd that anyone would spend even one minute of their lives protesting about a sauce mentioned in a cartoon. I mean, who am I to judge, but is this what existence has come to? </p>

<p>Today, we have more opportunity to learn than ever in the history of existence, yet sometimes I get out of bed and feel like I am in the Twilight Zone. Sometimes, I feel a sense of depersonalization, and I am beginning to think I am not alone. Reality is starting to feel almost absurd - as if it is not real. And that is the problem.</p>

<p><strong>Absurdism and Surrealism</strong></p>

<p>Interestingly, in comedy, another word for absurdism is &quot;surreal humor&quot;:</p>

<p>Surreal means bizarre - something that may feel real but it is not. To me, this word encompasses modern society. </p>

<p>Going along with surrealism is often absurdism, which according to Wikipedia, &quot;refers to the conflict between the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life and the human inability to find any. In this context absurd does not mean &#39;logically impossible&#39;, but rather &#39;humanly impossible.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>While I enjoy, at least comedically, the emphasis on absurdism and surrealism, it is important to note, &quot;Absurdism shares some concepts, and a common theoretical template, with existentialism and nihilism.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism</a></p>

<p>When life starts to lose meaning, things become absurd and nothing feels real. Often, when I am online, I hear the argument, &quot;Who cares? It is just the internet...it is not real.&quot;</p>

<p>The thing is, though, it is &quot;real.&quot; Maybe what they are trying to say is, &quot;It does not really matter.&quot;</p>

<p>That may be so - I cannot disprove it, but what I find dangerous is that many are starting to see their existence almost as &quot;unreal.&quot; When we view life is meaningless, who cares if reality is real or not?  What I find interesting is the cross between &quot;nothing really matters&quot; and &quot;nothing is real.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>People Stop Thinking</strong></p>

<p>When life becomes meaningless and surreal, people stop thinking. So many articles I read today are about &quot;carelessness.&quot; So many news articles I see today are about people saying they just were not &quot;thinking.&quot;</p>

<p>For example, I read an article recently about a girl who just pushed who friend off a bridge. In her defense, she was not thinking:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/woman-charged-in-washington-after-bridge-push-caught-on-camera/news-story/6453a0a3f493136e4c845c31af6f2552">https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/woman-charged-in-washington-after-bridge-push-caught-on-camera/news-story/6453a0a3f493136e4c845c31af6f2552</a></p>

<p>Here is an article about 20+ people who died while taking selfies, with number 1 being a man who died while trying to taking a selfie with a bear:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/selfie-deaths-092215/jacob-shelton">https://www.ranker.com/list/selfie-deaths-092215/jacob-shelton</a></p>

<p>Or, if you get a minute, do a google search of people who die while texting, recording YouTube videos, or doing something with their phones.</p>

<p>On a sadder note, do a google search of people who kill their own children while leaving them in the car. This was posted just a day ago:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/texas/baby-dies-in-hot-car-in-east-texas/1425172562">https://www.kxan.com/news/texas/baby-dies-in-hot-car-in-east-texas/1425172562</a></p>

<p>But, it seems as though every day you hear a story like this.</p>

<p>I am not saying I can prove that people are doing more stupid or tragic things today than they were 50 years ago; rather, I am saying there is a direct correlation between technology and the act of &quot;not thinking.&quot;</p>

<p>In nearly all of these stories, someone will claim, they just forgot. They just were not thinking. They just &quot;did&quot; it. When a baby dies in a car, it is often simply because a mom or dad is overwhelmed and &quot;not thinking.&quot;</p>

<p>I am not here to justify or judge or make fun of - that is not my intention. Rather, I am here to, again, ask, doesn&#39;t this all feel absurd? To lose your baby because you forgot it in a car? To die while taking a selfie? To die while texting? There is something about it that is surreal, and ultimately, sad.</p>

<p><strong>Not Thinking</strong></p>

<p>Reality becomes absurd when we stop thinking. Reality feels fake when we stop thinking. Reality seems meaningless when stop thinking.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that we have the capability and capacity to do nearly anything on the internet today, it does not seem to be making people any smarter, but rather, it seems to just be making our thoughts more automated.</p>

<p>It is so interesting because I often ask a question and a reply I get from friends is, &quot;Google it.&quot;</p>

<p>Look, I know Google probably has the answers, but I want a discussion, too - because sometimes it is not the answer I am looking for, but the discussion that leads to an answer.</p>

<p>In fact, Google makes people think they are smarter than they actually are, according to a Yale study:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11507200/Google-makes-people-think-they-are-smarter-than-they-are.html">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11507200/Google-makes-people-think-they-are-smarter-than-they-are.html</a></p>

<p>Yes, the information is there, but it is not &quot;our information&quot; - and that is the problem. It is no longer being stored into our minds and memories. Sure, we have access to it, but does it stay? </p>

<p>In a sense, even that is absurd. No longer do we have to remember anything. No longer do we have to think. Google is always there, right?</p>

<p>Look, I may be a little hyperbolic, but technology is not slowing down. Further, we are literally &quot;outsourcing&quot; our memories and experiences, which is known as the &quot;Google Effect&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/google-effect-is-technology-making-us-stupid-10391564.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/google-effect-is-technology-making-us-stupid-10391564.html</a></p>

<p>According to the article, taking photos even reduces our memories. Isn&#39;t that a little eerie? Today, the photo is the status symbol, and people take a lot of them (including me). In an almost absurd sense, we take a photo to keep a memory, but it may make it harder for our minds to keep that memory.</p>

<p>What happens when we allow something to always think for us, to keep our memories for us?</p>

<p>As the article notes,</p>

<p>&quot;He believes the combination of the Google Effect and the constant distraction of smartphones, constantly delivering information, is concerning. A Microsoft study found the average human attention span fell from 12 seconds in 2000 to eight seconds today.</p>

<p>&#39;There is a superficiality to a lot of our thinking,&quot; Carr says. &#39;Not just the cognitive side, but also the emotional side. That not only reduces richness in one&#39;s own life and sense of self, but if we assume that rich, deep thinking is essential to society then it will have a detrimental effect on that over the long run. There will always be people who buck those trends, but I think it will have an effect of making ourselves and our culture a little shallow.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>When we stop thinking, things feel more superficial, more absurd, and less real.</p>

<p><strong>Nothing is real; nothing matters</strong></p>

<p>Today, the belief that we are all &quot;star dust&quot; is supposed to be some type of comfort in a society without God or meaning. Don&#39;t you just love Neil DeGrasse Tyson?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slvR1QJIpjw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slvR1QJIpjw</a></p>

<p>To note, though, he is not the only person who believes this. Believe it or not, Aleister Crowley promoted the occult idea, &quot;Every man and woman is a star&quot; with the concept of Thelema (do what thou wilt):</p>

<p><a href="https://iao131.com/tag/every-man-and-every-woman-is-a-star/">https://iao131.com/tag/every-man-and-every-woman-is-a-star/</a></p>

<p>But, perhaps I can get into that in another post.</p>

<p>Today, though, I feel I could summarize society in the following ways (or at least what is promoted by pop culture and modern philosophy):</p>

<p>*Do what you want, as long as it makes you happy (thelema)</p>

<p>*We are specks (nothing) in the universe</p>

<p>*Life has no meaning, except what you make of it</p>

<p>*There is no right and wrong; all is relative</p>

<p>*Existence is chaos. Everything is random. Nothing has meaning.</p>

<p>*We should only believe what science tells us (scientism) (or what we can observe with our 5 senses)</p>

<p>*There is no God.</p>

<p>*You, ultimately, are meaningless.</p>

<p>*But be happy!! : )</p>

<p>If you believe these things, I am not here to judge. I am not saying you are wrong. But, what if...you are wrong? Further, all these concepts promote modern absurdism. If nothing is real, if nothing matters, then who cares? Who really cares? Sure, you can claim we are making the world a better place for future generations, but if nothing exists after we die, then what *really* matters?</p>

<p><strong>Is Society *really* better?</strong></p>

<p>I read a post today on Reddit, and the comment section was about how we were living in the safest time in history. Maybe that is so, but are things *really* better? Is there a correlation with modern nihilism and the fact that suicide rates are higher than ever?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/health/us-suicide-rate-surges-to-a-30-year-high.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/health/us-suicide-rate-surges-to-a-30-year-high.html</a></p>

<p>Despite feeling &quot;safe&quot;, I do not think society feels &quot;great.&quot; I feel that people are more depressed, anxious, and worried than ever:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/shift-mind/201203/is-our-society-manufacturing-depressed-people">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/shift-mind/201203/is-our-society-manufacturing-depressed-people</a></p>

<p>The quality of life has significantly declined in US adults:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.healio.com/family-medicine/practice-management/news/online/%7B67fa24c6-ebba-42d5-a4bd-a934d628012e%7D/quality-of-life-significantly-declines-in-us-adults">https://www.healio.com/family-medicine/practice-management/news/online/%7B67fa24c6-ebba-42d5-a4bd-a934d628012e%7D/quality-of-life-significantly-declines-in-us-adults</a></p>

<p>Teens (both boys and girls) are showing higher suicide rates:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/suicide-rates-teen-girls_us_59848b64e4b0cb15b1be13f4">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/suicide-rates-teen-girls_us_59848b64e4b0cb15b1be13f4</a></p>

<p>The point I am trying to get at is that though society may feel &quot;smarter&quot; and &quot;more technologically advanced&quot;, it seems that our lives have lost meaning. Everything becomes absurd. Everything is losing value. Things are breaking down. For some, their phone or laptop has become the key to their existence.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that absurd? Does it feel surreal?</p>

<p><strong>The Conspiracy</strong></p>

<p>So, what&#39;s the conspiracy? Well, on a conspiracy forum, we hear all the time about a &quot;new world order&quot; and its dangers, but it is *already* here.</p>

<p>While I cannot predict the future, I think they are tricking us. I think they are tricking us into believing there is going to be some huge cataclysmic event. EMP? World War III? Huge natural disaster?</p>

<p>Perhaps it sounds dramatic, but for the past few years, I have been expecting this cataclysmic event, only instead, to see those around me care less about others. Whether you believe in God or not, I think we could argue that people are worshipping themselves as Gods, today.  I mean, with our phones, aren&#39;t we the center of the universe? Does it give our lives some meaning?</p>

<p>Perhaps it sounds dramatic, but for the past few years, I have been expecting this cataclysmic event, only instead, to see those around me care less about others. Whether you believe in God or not, I think we could argue that people are worshipping themselves as Gods today.  I mean, with our phones, aren&#39;t we the center of the universe? Does it give our lives some meaning, after all?</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps this post is just philosophical ranting to you, but I hope I am making myself clear. The problem today is that people have lost meaning in their lives, and that is how we are all becoming enslaved.</p>

<p>Without meaning, our lives become inconsequential. Maybe that is why people appear to be &quot;thinking less.&quot; Maybe people are safer, but there seems to be a rise in emotional and psychological problems, drug addictions, anxiety, suicide, depression and more. </p>

<p>When I was an abusive relationship, the person gained power of me because they made me feel meaningless, under-valued, and low. If you wanted to gain power over someone (or a society), I believe the perfect way would be to make them feel that they did not matter - that their thoughts meant nothing. To me, in my physically abusive relationship, the emotional abuse was often far greater than the physical abuse (even though he nearly killed me). I am not hear to speak for all abuse victims, but what I am trying to get at is sometimes a mental prison is worse than a physical prison. Further, if &quot;they&quot; want people to give up, they just need to make sure that they feel like shit. </p>

<p>All we have left, maybe, is our own free thought. What happens when that is completely gone? Are we even really human?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel that combating, or undoing, this careless way of (not)thinking is to remain engaged with life, and all that is in it; to remain passionate about anything; to speak with honesty and conviction.  True joy and fulfillment lie within this way of living life, and I can’t help but think it could be contagious.  Life is most certainly absurd.  This doesn’t mean we are to take the absurdity to a level that says nothing matters.  Everything matters, and therein lies the true absurdity. As far as we know, we are it.  By we I mean the whole shebang, humans, animals, plants, things, etc.  The sheer amount of energy and beauty and intelligence of it all is breathtaking.  How dare anyone drift into thinking it is meaningless.  You know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting read, I have become a nihilist over time.</p>

<p>However I do not find it depressing, or limiting.  I find it freeing, as it takes objective meaning away from everything and allows my subjective experience to be all that matters.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean I am any less likely to follow societies norms, just that I recognize they are not absolute and don&#39;t get upset when the world and its people fail its own expectations.</p>

<p>Make sense at all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ever heard of the cosmic joke? Its similar to this feeling of nothing matter, its all so absurd. I feel it often, but rather than making me docile it empowers me more than ever to use this human vessel and do the best i can whilst I&#39;m here! It&#39;s quite a liberating feeling not a nihilistic one. Anyone else get this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. But it seems that there are really two extremes that the current loss of grounding gives rise to: optimism as you describe, or pessimism as another poster described (nihilism). Although I have strongly taken up optimism, I cannot ignore the case for pessimism. It’s got depth. What I think is worse is that many many people do not take either position and bumble along as if all were the same between the world we were taught about in school and the world we actually inhabit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know, but I think its necessary for some people to bumble along, and others to..well..not bumble along haha! It&#39;s just the balance of the world :) It is odd though, sometimes im just baffled by random mundanities like the fact that i have fingers. I mean what the hell?? FINGERS? Theyre so weird, why do i have them? For picking up stuff. what is stuff? Theres so much stuff!! And so on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In either case - optimistic bumbling or mindless bumbling - it should be obvious that the curvature of timespace as well as that of the multiverse must recursively return to itself - this very second - to freeze it and turn it into some disembodied spirit waiting to make a decision we cannot understand.</p>
