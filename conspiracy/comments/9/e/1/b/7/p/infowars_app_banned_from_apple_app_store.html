The military and police and white males are under attack? The military has never had so much power as it does now. If you subscribe to mainstream conspiracies, the military industrial complex has been running our country for decades. Police almost never get indicted or convicted of crimes against society. And our entire government is run by white males. 
Why do you feel like you are under attack?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, I’m shocked to see this upvoted here. Jewish folks are probably the biggest tribalism group in the world. They will do anything to make sure their people stay alive, as they are “gods chosen people”. There such a stigma when it comes to criticizing Jews. Catholics, Christians, Muslims, even Buddhism. But if you criticize Jews under any pretenses, you’re afar right Nazi fascist. You don’t have to be a Nazi to be critical of the Jewish faith. Historically, Jews have always been very subversive to ensure the survival of their people. People often forget, communism was created as refined  by Jews. Marx, Trotsky, Lenin etc,. They’ve built up this box around them that prevents them from being examined. If you are critical of Judaism you are either an anti-Semitic Arab or a Nazi. They are over represented in The media. They are over represented in politics. They are over represented in finance, realestate, and business. Is it because Jewish people genetically have a higher IQ and are just better at what they do than the rest? Are they protecting their own kind? It’s a good question to ask and even more to look into. This is a conspiracy forum after all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not really making your point when you actually <em>are</em> citing nazi propaganda about the spooky jewish communists. It&#39;s pretty hilarious anyways how they get shit when they are <em>for</em> capitalism, and they get shit when they are <em>against</em> capitalism, yet are still somehow part of one big jewish conspiracy.</p>

<p>And communism being &quot;created by jews&quot;(never mind that Marx didn&#39;t create communism, which is a soviet product) doesn&#39;t really make any bloody sense considering how Marx is literally the &quot;religion is the opium of the people&quot; guy, yet you&#39;re still pretending to only be criticizing the jewish faith, never mind that Marx was <em>ethnically</em> jewish, but his parents converted to Lutheranism and raised their children thus, which practically broke relations with their jewish family. The idea of marxism being some sort of jewish front is <em>literally</em> nazi propaganda no matter how you twist and turn it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See this is what I mean. Marx was some sort of an atheist but everything he believed in  was created from his young years and by the people he met while in college.Although his parents gave up Judiasm because of anti semitism , he was largely brought up in a Jewish household and was molded by it. Moses Hess the founder of Labour Zionism who he was inspired by in college, a socialist and a Jew. The poor Mosel-farmers, most of his closest acquaintances were Jewish. Being Jewish isn’t just a religion, its an ethnicity, a community, a way of life. To say Marx wasn’t influenced by Judaism is not only wrong, it’s ignorant. This is what I mean when I say when you criticize Judaism you are called a Nazi. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. This is a conspiracy forum so we all need to go a later deeper. Here&#39;s my take. </p>

<p>Alex Jones and Infowars are a government psyop. His family is CIA. He has ties to Stratfor. He engages in cointelpro-style tactics within the truth / conspiracy community to make conspiracy theorists look like right-wing nutjobs. There are countries and groups he never criticizes truthfully. </p>

<p>The censorship of AJ and Infowars is to normalize and justify censorship of all the real alternative media. </p>

<p>Google, YouTube, and Facebook already cut the guy offa while ago. Let&#39;s stop the outage against Apple and instead recognize that something else is afoot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think that’s likely Alex has exposed some real deal shit in the past despite his off the rails out there behavior as of late. People forget he exposed Bohemian Grove and was one of the first people to call out 9/11 and the Surveillance state. I think it can be more simply explained he probably just lost his mind and has some kind of underlining mental health condition rather than he is a CIA plant to make conspiracy theorists look bad even though he does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s how a limited hangout works. He didn&#39;t sneak into Bohemian Grove, he was let in. And he was allowed to cover Bilderberg, you or I would have been arrested. With a limited hangout, there&#39;s a certain amount of true information to build credibility. Sometimes the deeper truths are withheld, and people think the limited hangout is the whole truth. Other times the limited hangout is mixed with disinfo so anyone who believes the factual parts looks crazy by association. </p>

<p>DNS servers are controlled by the company that maintains the server. Most users are connected to their ISPs DNS Server by default. There are a few private DNS Servers that you can use if you don&#39;t want to use your ISP DNS Server.</p>

<p>somebody who tells all the tame ISPs to do some filtering. Some ISPs are actively censoring access to certain websites now</p>

<p>Unfortunately this is legal to do ever since net neutrality was removed.</p>

<p>certain keywords typed on certain websites can cause a mysterious 30 minute or hour long internet timeout too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Net Neutrality wouldn&#39;t have prevented Youtube from deleting his channel, nor would it prevent Apple from pulling an app from their store, so I&#39;m confused as to your point. </p>

<p>I&#39;m for consumer protections, it&#39;s just that for these actions taken against him, net neutrality has no effect either way. ISP&#39;s would have to continue to sell him/his company internet access and not block any IP&#39;s he owns, but no private company would have to host his content or applications. </p>

There are lots of people&#39;s telling people the world is flat and don&#39;t get shut down. InfoWars has been spouting insanse conspiracy theories for 20 years. Is it because they had enough?

Shit, you can find Christian churches that support anti vaccination that are far larger Thant Jone’s news.

To think you shouldn’t be able to be again any what the govt injects into your child’s body should be illegal? I’m not against vaccinations, but that’s crazy. They don’t get anything brought down on them You’re allowed to question things even if it’s stupid. Joe Rogan sells Alpha Brain and that’s literally almost exactly the same as Brain Force.

<p>The prob on not vactionating your kid is that its not only dangerous for him/her but also for others.</p>

<p>Aswell as there is very little proof people get autism form vactiontons.
The reson we have more &quot;autism&quot; now then back in the day is very simple. The spectrum of autism is so god daimbig. The DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders)
Is on nummer 5 as of 2013 since then there is a grow im autism since well a shit ton of things that where on there own a mental health issue have been scaled under autism. Back in the day a kid had lets say X it now has X wich is classed under A and A is Autism so the kid is Autistic. </p>

<p>A little? A lot? </p>

<p>This seems to be the internet’s new favorite word of the month right now so I’m just genuinely asking. For my own research purposes. </p>

<p>somebody who controls the DNS servers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>DNS servers are controlled by the company that maintains the server. Most users are connected to their ISPs DNS Server by default. There are a few private DNS Servers that you can use if you don&#39;t want to use your ISP DNS Server.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>somebody who tells all the tame ISPs to do some filtering. Some ISPs are actively censoring access to certain websites now</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately this is legal to do ever since net neutrality was removed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>certain keywords typed on certain websites can cause a mysterious 30 minute or hour long internet timeout too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is news to me. Do you have any examples that I can look into?</p>
