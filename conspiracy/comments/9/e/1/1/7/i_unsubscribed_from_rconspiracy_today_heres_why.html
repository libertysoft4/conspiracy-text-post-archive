<p>Everything I see is about normal fucking news events people perceive as conspiracies in which there are no laws broken whatsoever that people submit to promote their ideologies. I mean, I like you guys. You all seem like nice people. But you&#39;re not interested in truth as much as you should be. You&#39;re interested in conjecture. You don&#39;t fact check what you submit. You just submit it for the easy karma. Downmod me all you want, but it&#39;s the truth. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a way to get some easy karma. Everybody knows that. Who cares if you&#39;re apprehensive about submitting it because it&#39;s not very good content? Those boneheads at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> will upvote anything.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m tired of seeing shitty content on my front page. I come to reddit for a quality experience and this subreddit is detracting from that. It&#39;s the same reason I had to unsubscribe from <a href="/r/UFOs">/r/UFOs</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;ll come back sometime in the future and give this subreddit another shot, but for now, I&#39;m fed up. </p>

<p>So, with that said, adios. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand your point of view. But, this is not specific to just this sub-reddit. Look at (Glenn Beck obsessed) politics, worldnews, or even videos sub-reddits. You&#39;ll find crap in all of them. Hell, you&#39;ll find plenty of crap in real life too (Politics, music and Entertainment). However, this doesn&#39;t mean that you quit and look the other way.                   </p>

<p>You can simply ignore the ones that you find distasteful. Even better, participate and do your best to share and discuss quality stories based on fact and empirical evidence. To be fair, many of the top stories in this sub-reddit have been quite credible having more than one source.              </p>

<p>By the way, thanks for not listing one of the many stories I submitted in the past month in your crap stories list. And, even if you didn&#39;t like them, your opinion counts.  </p>

<p>Agreed. </p>

<p>You were one of the more vocal and level headed people around here. We rarely agreed on subjects, but I think we were both in the same line of thinking that a lot of the bullshit around here is pointless, and counter productive to people on either side of the discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I agree with you to a certain extent, I dislike how you generalize everyone on here as karma whores. I personally don&#39;t really care about karma, but I do care about people reading what I post and like to get feedback on ideas etc. </p>

<p>Also,  there are many subreddits that are bastions for karma whoring or where it&#39;s easy to get some quick karma. Cute, awww, lolcats, pics,
etc. So I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unique to conspiracy. </p>

<p>But I do agree that there&#39;s a great deal of bullshit on r/conspiracy and most people just want to indulge their own fantasies. I&#39;ve made submissions that I found really compelling and while they might get a few upvotes, no one really discusses the essence  of it or the implications. It always seems to degenerate into someone jumping onto the comments section and berating everyone involved, or the tin-foil hat name calling. 
Why don&#39;t you elaborate on what kind of conspiracy topics you would like to talk about and maybe start your own r/ and make it restricted or semi restricted and invite only users that you think would be suitable? That way real discussion may be able to take place, and people wouldn&#39;t be afraid of getting downvoted etc. 
I think it&#39;s possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I put a decent chunk of effort into a reply to the &quot;Swine Flu Vaccine Warning&quot; post, and it was totally ignored, that&#39;s the reason I&#39;m inclined to agree with the sentiment here.</p>

<p>Those sorts of conspiracy theorists generally aren&#39;t interested in intelligent conversation as far as I can tell now, they just enjoy being relatively mindless prophets of doom, a fairly interesting variation of a death cult, but only interesting from a very detached perspective.</p>

<p>Want a conspiracy about swine flu vaccinations?  It makes more sense that the government is purposefully trying to freak out conspiracy theorists into not taking a life saving vaccine, so that those distrustful of the government die off, then it does that they are trying to kill people with the vaccine itself.  That&#39;s pretty retarded, but it&#39;s actually less retarded then saying that this swine flu vaccine push is designed to kill people, if you&#39;re trying to use the 1976 swine flu vaccine push as evidence.</p>

<p>That&#39;s your problem right there man, if you want to be happy with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, you just have to follow a few simple steps:</p>

<h1>1 - Just go along with whatever youtube video people post, and certainly don&#39;t point out that youtube doesn&#39;t actually count as reputable evidence.</h1>

<h1>2 - Don&#39;t ask for actual evidence (that&#39;s the road to downvoteville) to support people&#39;s claims.  Just accept whatever they tell you without skepticism, <em>especially</em> when they don&#39;t present any real evidence to support; questioning the official <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> story is clear proof that you are a sheep and a slave to the government.</h1>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;A History of the World in Our Time&quot; is a very very good read, and anybody with some time on their hand should read it, especially as it relates to WWII.  Quiqley is a bit dry but it is a very, very interesting book.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the links, they are interesting and provide actual substance (the exceptions being the google video and the infamous &quot;list&quot; which I&#39;ll get to in a moment).  </p>

<p>Those links are exactly what we <em>should</em> see in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  The problem with the subreddit is <em>not</em> links like those, it is those in which a claim is made without evidence.  The problem is a simple youtube (or google) video; no matter how well-put-together it may be, it is still user-submitted and can&#39;t stand on its own as evidence.</p>

<p>Now, the list.  There are some really good points in there.  Many people have listed conspiracies which have in fact been proven to occur.  My big issue with that posting is Phazon&#39;s list and the fact that it has been copied several times in other threads as supporting evidence for conspiracies which have been proven.  Let&#39;s take a quick look at a few of these, shall we?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Great Depression</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not proven.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hindenburg disaster</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not proven.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The existence of the Bilderberg group</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>1 no one is denying the existence of the group, #2 provide proof of some conspiracy they have engaged in.</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Freud and others shaping of peoples behaviour and ideologies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well considering that the shaping of people&#39;s behavior was essentially Freud&#39;s life&#39;s work, it is a bit odd to include this as a conspiracy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sinking of the Titanic &amp; the proceeding creation of the Federal Reserve</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have proof (and I mean actual hard proof) of this, I would <em>love</em> to see it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The origin of AIDS</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not proven.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fluoride</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not proven.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aspartame</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not proven.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Enron</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;re including shady corporate practices as conspiracy now?  I guess technically this is not incorrect, but it seems to be well outside of what we mean by &quot;conspiracy&quot; in this subreddit.  If this can be included in the list, why not include <em>every single crime</em> which has ever been committed?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The existence of a group known as Al-Qaeda</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not proven.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The existence of man-made &quot;climate change&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not proven.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Drug trafficking by the C.I.A and other Intelligence agencies and organisations including notably during Vietnam in the coffins of dead U.S. soldiers and today in Afghanistan we&#39;re the opium/heroin trade had just spiralled into a slump prior to the invasion by the U.S. only to skyrocket to record highs in the years following.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not proven.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Continued imperialism by indebting impoverished countries to the World Bank and Central Banks that are setup in these nations all done through the use of C.I.A. &quot;jackels&quot; and other groups to either bribe political leaders, or failing that by assassination of those political leaders or lastly failing that military invasion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not proven.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Various banks and wall street criminals that havn&#39;t been caught and exposed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, crime now falls within the same category as government conspiracy?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Corrupt judges, legislators, politicians, police officers. That recent thing in New Jersey for example.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Various Mafia organisations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gangs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See above.</p>

<p>There are many more throughout the entirety of this thread, but Phazon&#39;s are the easiest to pick out and the most widely quoted in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> so I&#39;ll stick to these.  His post is pretty symptomatic of the problem with this subreddit as a whole; just because you believe something, or you see circumstantial evidence which might lead you to believe something, doesn&#39;t mean it is irrefutably true.  </p>

<p>Beyond that, the entirety of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> seems to misunderstand the purpose of those little up and down arrows to the left of comments.  Downvoting?  It is supposed to apply to comments which do not contribute to the conversation, not simply to comments you disagree with.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>excellent reply--thanks for participating...</p>

<p>part of the problem, however, is that of &quot;proof&quot; vs &quot;evidence&quot;...</p>

<p>there is <em>substantial</em> evidence to support many, if not all, conspiratorial claims in this /r/, and in the world--it isn&#39;t <em>evidence</em> in which we are lacking, it is substantive, conclusive <em>investigation</em> to confirm or negate these into proofs or falsities...</p>

<p>i know i have precious few resources to do any sort of thorough--hell, even <em>half-assed</em>--investigation...i suspect that there are more here like me, in that regard, than those who are independently wealthy, or connected, or whatever means it would take to get to the bottom of such investigation...</p>

<p>however, the utility of this forum is to present the evidences, and get them wide-spread enough, get them <em>visible</em> enough, that someone or some group that does have such ability will do just that...i do <em>not</em> participate in this, and other venues, simply to enjoy myself--i am sure that is true of you, also...these issues are important, not because we believe, or disbelieve--rather because we all, <em>as individuals</em>, are <em>important</em>...our lives have meaning and we deserve to have some equanimity, some autonomy, some <em>control</em> and measure of peace with that--instead of being told we do, then finding that there is good reason to suspect we are being lied to, deceived, and manipulated, with little or no recourse due to the severity and impact of the &quot;conspiracy(ies)&quot;...</p>

<p>that, thinker, is some of the reason i participate in this--to spread the exposure and build impetus to investigation, and solutions...</p>

<p>sigh...i do wish there were opportunity for all or any of us to meet and discuss these things, more casually, in person...</p>

<p>at any rate...thanks for participating...and...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m puzzled as to what kind of content you were expecting here.</p>

<p>By definition, conspiracy theorists have to extract the relevant patterns from the background noise.</p>

<p>I think of this subreddit as a wall of seemingly unrelated news clippings.</p>

<p>Then I draw red strings that I pin to some of those news clippings, until the full pattern emerges.</p>

<p>So far, it looks like a spider eating a banana. Or maybe like a bowl of oranges with a headphone.</p>
