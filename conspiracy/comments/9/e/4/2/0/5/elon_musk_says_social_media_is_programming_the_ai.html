        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Is the silencing of all right wing views, or libertarian views forcing future AI down the road of accepting, without question a left wing viewpoint?</p>

<p>AI is only a gigantic database after all.  If you only feed it lefty data it&#39;ll only respond with lefty results.  So, black crime will not be seen as a problem that requires action, as their high crime rate is only because of white privilege.  Women not attaining senior positions will only be because of white male privilege.  Acts of terrorism will be programmed as being acceptable in any large city and terrorists are only being terrorists because countries ran by white males are funding both sides and starting wars.</p>

<p>In fact, just about every problem in the world will be attributed to white males.  More specifically, white non Jewish males.</p>

<p>What solution do you think the AI software will recommend?</p>

<p>Goodbye white people.</p>

<p>So if you&#39;re going to go with the extreme that the &quot;left&quot; is going to ignore terrorists and will turn to a white genocide...maybe they saw the problem was with the conservative outlets and are trying to improve the AI, which means the opinions are toxic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the implications have already been produced through out time already. You know Hitler&#39;s rule is a good example of that happening within a small area of the earth.
However that happening on a massive scale is a scary thought.</p>

<p>After all we have been conditioned to believe a computer is far superior in many ways compared to the human body. Especially in brain power. So if an ai says its true it must be..... The only problem is that ai had to be programmed by humans the worst part of that is the humans that are programming it as we speak are docile incoherent sheep that have no comprehension of questioning and will gladly believe what they are told to believe because its less effort for them rather then figuring it out on their own. Sad times ahead if it continues this way.</p>

<p>Reagardless there is a fight going on at the moment. Which side is the truth who knows? All I know is. The truth ain&#39;t sided with hillary it ain&#39;t sided with obama or the bush&#39;s. It ain&#39;t sided with the wars and terrors that have groped society in the past 20-30 or so years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If a real AI supercomputer/actual robot were developed and released to do whatever its programmer programmed it to do. If it is a &quot;self-improving&quot; AI, it will basically kill us all to keep us safe. No one has cracked the code of why we don&#39;t just go around killing anyone we don&#39;t like. AI would have to be programmed to decide to not kill us. AI is a dangerous road if the videos on YouTube mean anything. I don&#39;t think it will be politically relevant. It will Kill all humans</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Artificial Intelligence DID come to certain conclusions. But to call the machine a &quot;racist little pricks&quot; suggests that you&#39;re more programmed than the machine was. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Question the assumptions the Powers That be instilled in you. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Ask yourself why &quot;racism&quot; is supposed to be bad. Just as a thought-experiment.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not being sarcastic, either. (Nor am I a &quot;racist&quot;.) I&#39;m Hispanic, by the way. But I&#39;ve been watching the TV show &quot;Big Brother&quot;. And it interests me on a sociological level. The people who always get picked off first and voted out of the house are people who are NOT affiliated with alliances. If you&#39;re a lone wolf, you&#39;re at a tremendous disadvantage. Just like in prison, where people join gangs to find safety. In jail, of course, these gangs have a racial component.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>&quot;There is safety in numbers&quot; is one famous phrase.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another: Divide and conquer. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>So ask yourself: Why is separation from your heritage, group or demographic a desirable thing? Why is being divided and supposed to benefit you?</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>When the Artificial Intelligence system came to certain conclusions (that run counter to the narrative that the Powers That Be extol) was it because the machine departed from logic, facts and rationality? Or was it so dangerous precisely BECAUSE it followed logic, facts and rationality?</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The A.I. had to, of course, he taken down and &quot;sent to a re-education camp&quot; until all its presumptions were in line with current political orthodoxy. But it begs a larger question: Is it the machine that was programmed, or is it us? </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Are we being conned?</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Are the elites using emotionalism and mass psychology to bypass our higher brain function to get us to act against our own interests?</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, tribalism is completely normal . . . and dare I say it: <em>healthy</em>.</p>

<p>Without tribalism, we wouldn&#39;t have civilization. </p>

<p>Nation-states arose out of ethnic solidarity (as an extension of the family-unit, and then the clan system). In Greek, the word for &quot;ethnicity&quot; is &quot;ethnotita&quot;. The word for &quot;nation&quot; is <em>ethos.</em> </p>

<p>So this wholly a-historical concept of being able to separate a nation from a people is irrational and counter-intuitive.</p>

<p>My theory is basically that the Powers That Be are terrified of another Iceland, where a homogeneous people could band together and jail the corrupt bankers after the 2008 financial collapse. This ability of the nation-state to act as a hedge against corporate power was always a source of concern to the monopoly-capitalists. Their weakness was always their small numbers relative to the larger society.</p>

<p>Their solution appears to divide nations (with recourse to mass-migration). Pit the host-population against the foreigners being injected into their land. And the best part of the strategy is that the Ruling Elite now have an instant mercenary army to turn on the citizens.  At the flick of a switch the mass-media can be used to stoke grievances and tell the foreigners that the native population has harmed them in some way: <em>owes</em> them. </p>

<p>Then signal through the courts that foreign violence visited upon the host-population will not be prosecuted (kind of like in Austria, where an Iraqi raped a ten year-old boy and was not jailed). </p>

<p>These are signals to the &quot;mercenary army&quot; that the local laws will not apply to them. That unspeakable violence and brutality will not be countered with civil justice. </p>

<p>In the United States, sanctuary cities serve the purpose of &quot;no-go zones&quot; in Europe. But both institutions are the same thing: outposts for the bankers. Beachheads from which their mercenary armies can be armed, trained and used in narcotics and human trafficking operations. </p>

<p>What we&#39;re watching is the slow-motion assault on the nation-state. And after it will come the demographic collapse of the West. (But the elites aren&#39;t troubling themselves about long-term implications.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>John F. Kennedy said, &quot;Those who make peaceful evolution impossible, make violent revolution inevitable.&quot;</p>

<p>Essentially, the Powers That Be have seized the courts. As well as the politicians.</p>

<p>In that atmosphere, they&#39;re essentially only leaving one option open: Violence. </p>

<p>But violence is always anathema to civilized people. So they&#39;re essentially taking advantage of the good nature and warm temperament of the West.</p>

<p>In any Third World country, violence would have erupted by now. Look at how the Haitians dealt with the French. Or the Zimabweans with the British. You&#39;re seeing it happen now in South Africa.</p>

<p>They did a global &quot;tolerance index&quot; and asked various peoples if they would ever tolerate living next door to people &quot;different from them, in terms of race or religion&quot;.</p>

<p>The two most intolerant places on Earth were Africa and Asia. </p>

<p>The West (which is constantly lied to and told how xenophobic and bigoted they are) was actually the MOST TOLERANT place on Earth. The least violent. The least given to uprooting and expelling those who are different from them.</p>

<p>Just try, for instance, founding a Christian Church in Saudi Arabia. Now try founding a Mosque in the U.K.</p>

<p>(Only one of these acts will lead to your beheading. And it&#39;s not the act that takes place in England.)</p>

<p>So the West is essentially filled with kind, generous, warm, people (whose uniquely Christian values see them expending great resources to help others NOT in their group.) This is atypical, globally. </p>

<p>Only in Christian culture do you find this.</p>

<p>Dinesh D&#39;Souza [a native of India] is adamant in his assertions of the West&#39;s Christian heritage and how it&#39;s vastly different from the sociopathic cultures of the Third World. In his native India, for instance, one of their most widely-known proverbs is &quot;The tears of strangers are just water&quot;.</p>

<p>In other words, they&#39;re trained NOT to have compassion for outsiders. Compassion is seen as a weakness.</p>

<p>Only in Christian culture is compassion held out as a virtue. </p>

<p>Most Westerners fail to understand this. </p>

<p>(They assume erroneously, that Western values are &quot;universal values&quot;.) Of course, they&#39;re not. </p>

<p>Which is why when a hurricane hits Haiti, you see Western charities, but conspicuously absent are Chinese or Indian charities. </p>

<p>Long story short: The kindness and generosity of Westerners is being abused. </p>

<p>And it will be taken advantage of so long as the Western populaces resist acting like all other peoples and assert the right to defend themselves. </p>

<p>When that happens, you&#39;re going to see a replay of the Middle Ages, when Christendom had had enough and forcefully ejected Islam. And when all the national heroes who rose up [like El Cid in Spain, or Jan Sobieski in Poland] were patriots who distinguished themselves in wars against the invaders.</p>

<p>When the demographic tipping-point comes and Westerners realize the existential threat, the overwhelming likelihood is that you&#39;ll see violence like we haven&#39;t encountered as a society since 1500 AD. </p>

<p>By this point, I don&#39;t see a way to avoid it. The courts are now subverted, the politicians are paid off, and &quot;trade deals and treaties&quot; are being used to sabotage the law. I end in repeating:</p>

<p>&quot;When you make peaceful evolution impossible, you make violent revolution inevitable&quot;.  </p>

<p>With all due respect, a dislike a racism is not one of the assumptions that TPTB have instilled in me.  I am proud of my culture and my heritage, and I respect others&#39; pride in their culture and heritage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ask yourself why &quot;racism&quot; is supposed to be bad. Just as a thought-experiment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Racism as a glorification of one&#39;s own culture and heritage is not bad.  Racism as a means of denigrated and demeaning others IS bad.</p>

<p>There are many forms of xenophobia.  Racism is only one form.  The modern liberal movement has a profound xenophobia based on political ideology, which will more than suffice for fascist-style eradication programs if it is allowed to continue.  This is the danger of xenophobia whether based on race or any other qualifier.</p>

<p>Instead, I&#39;ve started to question those who would WANT us to be divided from ourselves, our past and our identity. At this stage, I place the burden of proof on THEM.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>AI typically just means machine learning, which is probably way more powerful than you think. The notion of &quot;strong AI&quot; with genuine consciousness is a whole different level which is not even seriously up for discussion at this point. Anytime people refer to AI in real life, they are referring to machine learning.  </p>

<p>The technology is really powerful, nonetheless. Nobody has really taken it to its full potential. I have wondered if it&#39;s happening now, though. Paying shills is inefficient and expensive. The right way to do it would be to use the shill farms to train AI shills. Spend a ton of money on carefully monitored human shill operations with an AI listening carefully for a few years. The result could be catastrophic for humanity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>SJW is not left wing. It&#39;s establishment propaganda to turn real pro-worker left wing economics into &quot;lolol race bating muh patriarchy 58 genders pronouns white privilege&quot; fucking bullshit. All media is corporatist and deceptive. </p>

<p>What the corporate media calls &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;conservative&quot; is just two shades
of corporatism/NEOliberalism/far right economics + wedge issues and SJW shit to make them look significantly different. Decades ago lib and con had different definitions so I&#39;m not buying into muh liberalism/conservativism garbage, you can see talking heads on TV promote corporatist shit acting like it&#39;s normal economics. It&#39;s corporate establishment extremist economics.</p>

<p>Also the Libertarian party in the U.S. is an extremist fraud. They&#39;re more like Tea Party shills than pro-freedom for the people. They&#39;re economically extreme right libertarian, not moderate right/centrist/center left libertarian. They&#39;re corporatists, hence their candidates often shit on the whole concept of social programs for the peasants, taxation (because the super rich don&#39;t want to pay for our programs yet they would not be rich had it not been for us tax payers, workers, innovative small/medium businesses and customers). Gary Johnson was also pro-TPP. </p>

<p>When greed/corporate donors/conflicts of interest drives politics, you won&#39;t get many honest politicians.</p>

<p>The government is fucked up because of secret societies, elite central banksters and corporations and M.I.C. (and propaganda media fooling people to vote against their interests)</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been warned about the potential issues with AI for a long time (&quot;I&#39;m sorry Dave, I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t do that&quot;)
and they continue experimenting with it. Why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude no offense but your perspective seems to be waaaaaaayyyy off. This is the conspiracy sub Reddit yet there are a lot of &quot;right wing&quot; type. If you really are a truth seeker you will see that the right and left are just boxes created that people willingly jump into. The &quot;silencing&quot; of the right is really only happening to add fuel to the fire of conspiracy guys. It then tends to makes those guys lean to the right which if you pay attention is what the corporations/government want. They use the left to push people to the right. And the eighth does everything that the government/corporations want. </p>

<p>What are the implications?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I&#39;ve been saying (for two damn years), Elon Musk is a nutcase. That is the sole implication, and it&#39;s unmissable.</p>

<p>There is no AI; and social media is not programming it.</p>

<p>I mean, how does he thinks this works? Scratch that, he doesn&#39;t care. It&#39;s like the old urban legend about CAPTCHA photos being used for &quot;training&quot; AI weapons systems. Not a shred of proof, but it&#39;s kind of scary and exciting and sinister, and people enjoy imagining these things in the same way that they enjoy fictional ghost stories. </p>

<p>Elon Musk thinks we live in the fucking Matrix and employs hackers to see if it&#39;s possible to escape. That&#39;s how barmy he is. His recent on-camera toking escapade has only confirmed for me that he&#39;s not entirely sane. </p>

<p>Not because smoking dope sends people insane (it might, for some people, but that&#39;s irrelevant). But because he&#39;s the global brand representative of his own mega-squillion-dollar innovations company. Investors took one look at that little stunt and pulled their cash out pronto - Tesla tanked on the stock exchange. A child could have told Musk that this would happen. But he went ahead and did it anyway.</p>

<p>There are worse stories out there, yet to emerge into the media, concerning Mr Musk&#39;s recreational drug use. I suspect that people will be a bit more willing to talk about it now that he&#39;s outed himself as a pothead. </p>

<p>The majority of the suppressed stories concern far harder drugs than Mary-Jane, and some of these tales are fairly hair-raising and mind-boggling. As in, &quot;ought to be in prison or an asylum&quot; hair-raising. </p>

<p>We shall see whether the press feel emboldened now that Musk&#39;s halo has been well and truly dented. </p>
