<p>I’m so fucking tired of twenty million posts about how your favorite LARP sub was banned. I’m tired of the whiny “leftists are targeting conservatives on social media REEEE,” posts. I’m tired of the obvious agendas and vendettas. </p>

<p>I hate all the political bullshit. If we have to ban both Hillary and Trump posts, then fine. There’s no evidence of Hillary doing anything, and the Mueller investigation is focused on Russian collusion and criminal acts anyways - not a fucking conspiracy there. </p>

<p>This sub needs to return to its roots and ban all partisan political posts. I doubt this will happen because certain mods seem to be pushing a political agenda as well, but maybe they’ll surprise me. </p>

<p>What are your thoughts? </p>

“There’s no evidence of Hillary doing anything wrong.”
Then you went straight into crazy town with; 
“Mueller investigation is focused on Russia collusion and criminal acts anyway, no fuckin conspiracy there.”
What the actual fuck? That is the only fuckin conspiracy. The collusion or criminal acts were all  done by the Clinton camp. There is tons of evidence of collusion and criminal activity there. 
You’re just one of those delusional freaks that thinks Hillary is just some innocent grandma. 
I can assure you, she is not. She’s a fucking monster. </p>

You said there’s no evidence of her committing a crime, and that is just blatantly false. You act like there’s a reason for the Mueller investigation. That is false. I only go by what I read in front of me.</p>

The point of that post is that when you have someone who posts to a bunch of random subreddits, yet spends a good amount of time here commenting <em>against</em> conspiracy theories, it raises questions about why they are here.
