<p>I disagree with this 10000%, I posted on and viewed that sub everyday and I never saw anything like threats or attempts at doxxing people. Memes are no reason to ban a subreddit, and neither is &#39;off topic garbage&#39; or &#39;random observations&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It can&#39;t work because the originals got banned, and you can&#39;t make a second version of a sub that got originally banned. Try it, it will go nowhere. Q anon is officially censored on reddit, end of story.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Doubtful due to the fact that they won&#39;t be able to build up a community with trusted mods like G_A had, most anons who browsed G_A are moving on over to voat right now, if they weren&#39;t there already. </p>

<p>Crazy how you never saw how <a href="/r/greatawakening">/r/greatawakening</a> mods followed their 4chan prophet&#39;s lead and encouraged their users to go and harass a random parody account on twitter, considering you visited it every day. Bans like this take a while to form and come from a variety of factors, but the Q network of subreddits was very clearly guilty of mod-endorsed targeted harassment and doxxing and contributed to the ban</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the difference does matter.</p>

<p>You say that &quot;mod-endorsed targeted harassment and doxxing and contributed to the ban&quot; yet if you browsed the GA sub every day like I and many others did, you&#39;d know mods removed stuff that could lead to doxxing or targeted harassment extremely quickly. They did everything in their power to run a tight ship, just like t_d, knowing that reddit would use any excuse they could to ban them. Funny that is exactly how it went down.</p>

<p>Meanwhile TMOR brigades this sub daily, as well as t_d and GA during its existence. </p>

<p>What happens to them? Nothing. No surprise there. </p>

<p>So quickly that <a href="https://i.imgur.com/uwjToPq.jpg">all</a> these <a href="https://i.imgur.com/k2tnTYF.jpg">threats</a> were <a href="https://i.imgur.com/oVlsoDw.jpg">made</a> after <a href="https://i.imgur.com/t8enPRz.jpg">being</a> posted on greatawakening and related subreddits.

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you posted was from Twitter. GA mods can&#39;t do anything about a bunch of bots on twitter pretending to be &#39;sent by q&#39;</p>

<p>We already know that Twitter is censored and controlled, they love to dictate which type of posts get traction and which don&#39;t. Twitter censors conservative postings and promotes mainstream opinions. A bunch of accounts saying &#39;q sent me&#39; is not proof that the Q subreddit promoted doxxing or harassment. </p>

<p>Again, if you actually knew what you were talking about, you&#39;d know the mods at G_A did everything they could to keep that stuff off the subreddit.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well I&#39;d love to link a proof of this to you but, well, you know. The simple fact of the matter is that even posting a screenshot of the  &quot;drop&quot; would probably (I&#39;m definitely not privy to this decision) count as encouraging harassment if there were suddenly a bunch of threats on that twitter account. You asked what sort of threats and doxxing could lead to a ban and I have shown you what kind of threats can. Bans like these don&#39;t come from nowhere, and the harassment of twitter users by Q supporters, again after his drop was posted on reddit, was widely reported both on the site and off it</p>

<p>That&#39;s debatable. If I post a screenshot of a tweet and TMOR doxxes the twitter account, are they going to get banned? Highly unlikely, because they do it all the time. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s very easy to manufacture these types of threats especially on Twitter which is 100% controlled and compromised at this point. All it takes is 100 bot controlled accounts to send death threats saying Q sent them and boom, there is your &quot;&quot;&quot;evidence&quot;&quot;&quot; that is good enough for someone like you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying people were getting harrassed on Twitter by greatawakening users, in Twitter? To blame that sub makes about as much sense as tits on a bull.  If NBC shows a sporting event and two friends watch, have a disagreement and come to blows, is it NBCs fault?  This just adds legitimacy to much of what Q and President Trump say about the media. </p>

<p>FWIW, I visited the greatawakening daily.  There were a lot of weirdos on there.  BUT this is real, and you should look into qanon.  I never saw any threats on the ga subreddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yep! In fact it would be seen as even worse than if the harassment is contained within Reddit, if Reddit is seen as the source of it. The admins can&#39;t have users organizing doxxing and harassment of random people on their platform, and are usually very quick about coming down on subs that do it/mods that condone it.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is the wrong analogy. The correct one would be if NBC pointed the camera at a random person in a crowd and encouraged their viewers to find out who they are, write them hateful messages and attempt to expose them as a pedophile. Which would definitely land NBC in PR trouble, if not legal trouble.</p>

<p>Any links to people saying similar things about Trump? I&#39;m serious.</p>

<p>&quot;Likely&quot;, but you have no idea if true, and no proof. Is that just what you want to be true?</p>

<p>Yes please do. Also try to provide comments not all sourced from the same post... posted within the last 24 hours (Try to find some comments before TheBanout declared their organised bridading for example...) </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty easy to have a list of archived links ready if you know where the offending posts are and that the sub is going to be removed &#39;because of them&#39;. Why do you have this list of archived comments? did you know the sub was going to be removed before hand? </p>

<p>I bet OP doesn&#39;t respond to this. Reeks of organised shilling. </p>

<p>they were linked in this article:</p>

<p>and before you cry “MSM is FAKE NEWS”, are the comments real or not?</p>
