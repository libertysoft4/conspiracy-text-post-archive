    <div class="md"><p>SS: One week ago the National Solar Observatory in Sunspot New Mexico was closed due to &#39;security concerns&#39; with no other information given.  </p>

<p>Although local law enforcement assistance with the evacuation was requested outside the facility, they also were given no details regarding the closure including how long to expect the shutdown to last.</p>

<p>Local residents reported seeing member of the FBI involved, a Blackhawk helicopter on site, and work crews on top of structures working on or installing antennas and other equipment.</p>

<p>Residents Sunspot, observatory staff and employees of the post office were given just minutes to evacuate.  None were detained or even questioned.</p>

<p>What exactly is going on at Sunspot?  To date it&#39;s a big mystery, and no one has gone on record in the last week with any further explanation or updates.  </p>

<p>Does the situation have anything to do with the Sun itself?  There are solar observatories operating around the world that could seemingly answer this question.</p>

<p>Is there really a security or safety concern on site?  There has been no mention or siting of the EPA, OSHA, hazmat etc.</p>

<p>What about the NSO&#39;s other capabilities?  There are military facilities nearby including Holloman AFB, White Sands Missile Range, etc.  Is something about to be conducted/tested that tptb do not want observed?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the background as I know it.  Fwiw I couldn&#39;t be LESS of an expert or knowledgeable about solar observatories or space in general.  There&#39;s a big thread located here; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9ey2ub/anyone_thats_been_following_the_closure_of_the?sort=%C3%B8">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9ey2ub/anyone_thats_been_following_the_closure_of_the?sort=ø</a> they do other types of work we don&#39;t know about?  I know an extensive part of the tower is underground, is there more to it?</p>

<p>*Related to all these evacuated staff, I&#39;ve yet to see ONE interviewed or questioned.  The hell?</p>

<p>*Why would the FBI conduct the closure in such a manner?  Not even a lame cover story.  It&#39;s almost</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey there, I used to live in Sunspot until a month ago, so lemme put in some thoughts. </p>

<p>There are not 100-170 staff working there. Most of them have moved to Colorado. The observatory is in the process of shutting down right now. There are only about 7 people living there right now.</p>

<p>Blackhawk helicopters are kinda rare, but I did see one flying around last December near my house, just a thought.</p>

<p>Its just Sunspot too. The APO, another observatory is only about less than a mile from the NSO, yet it remains open. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a conspiracy theorist, nor do I ever want to be, but I&#39;m just dropping some stuff in this thread, from someone who until recently used to live there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, I pulled that 100-170 from a very shakey memory from reading a ton of links then being unable to find it again, so that&#39;s completely my fault.  I apologize for that disinformation.  In fact the entire SS was typed from memory, rather than cut &amp; paste.</p>

<p>My point was tho that why haven&#39;t we heard yet from someone who was living or working there at the time?</p>

<p>Thanks for the first hand info!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still go to school with one of the kids who lived up there, and all he had to tell me was that they were told they had to evacuate, and they would be given a hotel room down in Alamogordo to stay in if they wanted. </p>

<p>Nobody who worked at the observatory lived in Sunspot anymore. The only people up there were just maintenance, the person working the post office, and the one person who worked the visitor center. No scientists. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen a lot of posts in here about a Chinese Spy, and I want to confirm that there was someone up there who was Chinese (I&#39;m Chinese-American myself, born in Ohio) but he was there to work at the APO kind of like a exchange student. I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s a spy or not, and I&#39;d like to not get in conspiracy territory, but I don&#39;t think he is. He came here to work, even wrote a scientific paper(about Calcium in stars or something) with my dad, and left at the end of August. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The solar storm of 1859 (also known as the Carrington Event)[1] was a powerful geomagnetic solar storm during solar cycle 10 (1855–1867). <strong>A solar coronal mass ejection (CME) hit Earth&#39;s magnetosphere and induced one of the largest geomagnetic storms on record, September 1–2, 1859</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>A solar storm of this magnitude occurring today would cause widespread disruptions and damage due to extended outages of the electrical grid.</strong>[2][3] The solar storm of 2012 was of similar magnitude, but it passed Earth&#39;s orbit without striking the planet.[4]</p>

<p>Carrington flare</p>

<p>From August 28 to September 2, 1859, many sunspots appeared on the Sun. On August 29, southern auroras were observed as far north as Queensland, Australia.[5]</p>

<p>The flare was associated with a major coronal mass ejection (CME) that travelled directly toward Earth, taking 17.6 hours to make the 150 million kilometre (93 million mile) journey. It is believed that the relatively high speed of this CME (typical CMEs take several days to arrive at Earth) was made possible by a prior CME, perhaps the cause of the large aurora event on August 29 that &quot;cleared the way&quot; of ambient solar wind plasma for the Carrington event.[6]</p>

<p>On September 1–2, 1859, one of the largest recorded geomagnetic storms (as recorded by ground-based magnetometers) occurred. Auroras were seen around the world, those in the northern hemisphere as far south as the Caribbean; those over theRocky Mountains in the U.S. were so bright that the glow woke gold miners, who began preparing breakfast because they thought it was morning.[6] People in thenortheastern United States could read a newspaper by the aurora&#39;s light.[11] </p>

<p><strong>Telegraph systems all over Europe and North America failed, in some cases giving telegraph operators electric shocks</strong>.[17] Telegraph pylons threw sparks.[18] Some telegraph operators could continue to send and receive messages despite having disconnected their power</p>

<p>In 1909, an Australian gold miner C.F. Herbert retold his observations in a letter toThe Daily News in Perth:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>lights of every imaginable color were issuing from the southern heavens ... The superstitious and the fanatical had dire forebodings, and thought it a foreshadowing of Armageddon and final dissolution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In June 2013, a joint venture from researchers at Lloyd&#39;s of London and Atmospheric and Environmental Research (AER) in the United States used data from the Carrington Event to <strong>estimate the current cost of a similar event to the U.S. alone at $0.6–2.6 trillion</strong>.[2]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s where my thoughts went first, but any unusual activity would be spotted by numerous solar &amp; space agencies.  Although there have been claims several sites are/have been down recently.  But really, how would you hide something of that magnitude?  Not that I have any illusions we would be informed if it could be kept from the public.  Also any flare or CME detected would be long over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that was very interesting.</p>

<p>I also find the name of the town ironic; is it named for the observatory?</p>

<p>Definitely worth watching, the lack of government transparency is notable too.  I don&#39;t think they&#39;d have to go to such measure to prep for an EMP; internet on the east coast basically died a couple years ago for a few hours (likely intentional;) once it returned it was like it never happened. (that was just a DNS attack iirc) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is an accurate assessment, although I would add the DMV is also on fire.  </p>

<p>We are addicted to technology and information.  We rely on it for everything.  I think if we were suddenly without electricity or any electronics on a national or global level, things would break down fairly quickly.  Historically during blackouts and power failures locally, people have remained pretty calm.  I don&#39;t think that would last long if people didn&#39;t know help was on the way.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding of the phenomena is that a solar superstorm or CME would just fry the electronics altogether.  Nothing would work.  The electrical systems would all overload and magnetic interference would disrupt radio waves and knock out satellites making those methods of communications useless in the affected areas.  The conductors and components of your electronic devices would overload and fail - cell phones, walkie talkies, computers and radios - largely useless.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how long it would take to replace or repair a nationwide power grid.  Look at post hurricane Puerto Rico.  It took a year to restore power?</p>

<p>If the radios were not on during the event, and shielded from radiation (i.e. in a faraday cage or ceramic enclosure), or were made from vacuum tubes (again... not on during the event). Lots of prepper-type folks keep radios stored as backups in metal boxes for exactly this reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a movie on Netflix (How It Ends) that deals with a solar storm and the resulting chaos.  Well, there&#39;s more going on but I thought they did a good job showing the kinds of things that might happen.  It&#39;s annoying though that the characters never seem to figure out what&#39;s happening is a solar event (likely a CME).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sudden intense heat, the power lines catching on fire, the radio frequencies getting messed up (for lack of a better term), the power grid and internet/cell service going down, and the intense auroras they were seeing from southern/middle Minnesota through South Dakota to the Seattle area.  Even the volcanoes/earthquakes could be from a massive CME/solar storm. </p>

<p>It reminded me of, I believe it was Graham Hancock, that had posited that various cave paintings depict a crazy strong solar storm&#39;s auroras that may have looked like human figured to ancient humans.  This would&#39;ve been around Gobleki Tepe&#39;s either construction or abandonment.  It&#39;s been a while since I read this stuff so I may be off.</p>

Considering New Mexico State University runs the observatory and it is tied into the National Solar Observatory, it most likely is networked into numerous research networks. China was probably just stealing research and development like they always do by hacking into the various systems from that site since it&#39;s a less than optimal secured location but would have direct connection to data streams to send/receive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be right, it is certainly plausible.  But why evacuate employees on short notice without holding any to question?  Why evacuate the post office?  Looking at google maps, the area is pretty isolated.  The observatory, a post office, what looks to be about 30 houses and a small store, all with one road in and out.  You could order people into their houses and set up privacy tents to obscure any monitoring equipment that needed to be set up.  The only reasons I can think of to empty a place of people are when you don&#39;t want them to witness something, or you don&#39;t want them exposed to something.  Can you not investigate Chinese electronic spying with citizens nearby?  Evacuation may be a cover story itself but it just doesn&#39;t seem to add up.  Am I missing something obvious?</p>

Look at the latest Chinese spying issues concerning this. It shows from an Obama presidency someone who decreased defense spending has no idea ( or simply doesn&#39;t care ) about who and what their enemies intentions are. ( or they&#39;re sellouts making deals with the Chicoms).
Either way it&#39;s good to know we&#39;ve got a President who isn&#39;t going to turn a blind eye to defense in all shapes and forms. From Border security, to cyber security. We can&#39;t afford for this country to be infiltrated by advancing nations in the tech industries.  The Democrats warm and cuddly relationships with them buying everything in Holly Wood etc and the fact the left worships these types is extremely alarming. The fact Google&#39;s Alphabet aided China in the facilitation of the Great Chinese Firewall is also alarming. You don&#39;t think they plan to use the same tactics over here ? You&#39;d be an idiot!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the smartest information technology persons I know always had a hunch they were putting back doors in all the chips they make. It&#39;s partly the reason some defense facilities in the USA&#39;s system contain chips  made by reliable U.S. derived sources.  If this wasn&#39;t an actual threat. We wouldn&#39;t bother to spend the money on our own proprietary chips. Coincidence?  </p>

They would come over the poles toward the Northern US to take out power grid connection points. Perhaps Team Rocket Man took over the observatory, or the feds want to use the observatory as a first line of defense?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, if it truly were a Mercury spill//leak, I would imagine that officials wouldn’t have a problem telling residents or the public that that is the reason for closing and evacuating........it’s not “shocking” lol. Plus, you’d want people to get checked out health wise. No. This is something they are intentionally keeping from the public, most likely to prevent mass panic. I mean, we hear about anthrax threats on the news when they happen.....officials don’t hide that kind of thing. They can’t for many reasons. I think people are also reading too much into the post office as well......I think that it was just closed because they evacuated the whole area.....what are they going to leave the small post office open with no residents to serve? Lol. And if it is some kind of health or safety issue, then closing the post office makes sense.....just like they closed the observatory. Just like they evacuated the area residents. I don’t believe the post office has anything to do with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So this may be unrelated buuuut both me and my neighbor across the street have Solar panels from Tesla and we both had a major spike yesterday in power... His panels system is 10.4 with an AC/DC inverter that can handle up too 12kwh AC power output.. Mine is a 9.4 kWh system with an AC/DC inverter that can handle 7.6 kWh AC output.. Both his and mine spiked to 15kWh at 12 noon EDT yesterday. We both were shocked and thought it was a solar flare.. and also shocked that out inverters didn&#39;t blow up.... This was before I knew anything about these solar observatories being closed down... Coincidence???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting... yesterday someone posted a pic that was supposedly the last image the observatory took before it went offline and it was just a sliver of sun, as if a planet was in front of it. I wonder if it’s possible the object flew in front of the telescope, or if it was actually a planet or something of that scale</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just saying, the monitoring seems most plausible, but like you very succinctly stated, &quot;why evacuate all the surrounding homes?&quot;  Great point, and still lends some support to what you said, about an event either occurring in the vicinity, or an experiment being conducted by White Sands.</p>

<p>Regardless of the answer, everything is still super fucking weird...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, I pulled that 100-170 from a very shakey memory from reading a ton of links then being unable to find it again, so that&#39;s completely my fault.  I apologize for that disinformation.  In fact the entire SS was typed from memory, rather than cut &amp; paste.</p>

<p>My point was tho that why haven&#39;t we heard yet from someone who was living or working there at the time?</p>

<p>I doubt it has anything to do with the observatory itself. I can view sunspots and solar events using my own modest solar telescope. Anything odd going on up there would be impossible to hide by closing this place. Besides, nobody in the FBI is qualified to operate a telescope like this. As others have said it&#39;s more likely something to do with the antenna arrays that workers have been seen inspecting. Possibly compromised by hackers spying on the nearby white sands missile range.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t the DOD be showing face then?</p>
