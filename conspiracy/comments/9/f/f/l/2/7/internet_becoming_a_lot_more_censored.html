Lately, I&#39;ve been drawn back in because of the censorship I&#39;ve been noticing. For example, if you google a certain conspiracy youtube documentary like JFK A Rich Man Trick youtube has disabled the comments saying it has been reported for offensiveness you can&#39;t even share it. Even when you try and search up conspiracy video it&#39;s hard to find and has the same disabled shit as JFK a rich man trick. Not to mention try and google conspiracy video and information and see what happens. Where in the world are we suppose to go and gain knowledge now when everything censored? </p>

It made me realize the dangers of trusting the internet for research purposes at the same time as they were promoting google scholar. Some of the censorship and rewriting or dumbing down of world history and events is so absurd that I’m not sure if its supposed to draw attention to how bad censorship is and provoke people to take action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember going online for the first time back in ‘93. I went to a friend’s house with the only motivation being ordering a Slackware Linux CD/book from a website I’d seen advertised in Byte magazine. After the order was submitted, friend said I should check out the chats. It was IRC in this case. I ended up in a random chat room with people from all over the world and in less than two hours I had made a personal connection with a girl from NC who later became a friend and we met in person a few times. I was amazed at the level of connectivity and the potential to bring people together. I never expected things to end up where we are today. The social media platforms have turned what should’ve been (in theory) a unifying tech into a literal battlefield. I mean, people’s lives and families being completely ruined because they posted something someone somewhere didn’t agree with or, worse, because of their political leanings. Fucking disgusting. </p>
