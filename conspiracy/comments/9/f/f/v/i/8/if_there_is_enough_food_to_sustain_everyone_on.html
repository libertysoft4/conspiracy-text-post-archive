<p>I&#39;m not exactly sure why people care when those who are starving have no food, unless the government of that place is pretty much forcing the starvation.</p>

<p>It makes me wonder why people don&#39;t have food, but have more children while starving. That&#39;s just bad planning, right there. </p>

<p>Think about all the stuff that exists that you (or 99%) can&#39;t buy/afford right now (and likely never, like ferraris etc). Would you miss it? does it matter that it is no longer on the shelf that you can&#39;t reach anyway?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk I see it more of a slave situation.</p>

<p>It seems like more and more people are waking up to the illusion of freedom we are living in so I think they will keep the illusion up but things will be so heavily restricted no one will have a place like Reddit to just talk and share their opinions openly. I see it as a 1,000,000 merits type life. If you watch black mirror you know what I mean.</p>

<p>With what you said about missing things I will never have. No I won’t. I can’t miss something I have never had. I could wish for it though. That’s what is keeping this system turning in the first place. The idea that hey it’s possible that I could have diamonds draped on my neak and a yacht to park my lambo on. </p>

<p>In the future maybe the only thing we have to know to wish for is our next meal we will be paid in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I think the current situation is very much like slavery.</p>

<p>Even most self-employed are actually just working/slaving for the bank that provides their credit (at any time the bank can close their business by denying credit etc.). </p>

<p>You&#39;re not paid in meals at the moment, but for many many people living paycheck to paycheck, it is basically the same thing: 100% of income goes to the basic needs like meals and housing and transport. </p>

<p>Everybody is temporarily embarrassed millionaires (not sure who first made up this quote) wishing for the ferrari, but the reality is that most by far never climb even one step higher on the social ladder than where they were born.</p>

<p>I once got a fair amount of cash from a company sale. Before the sale I was quite poor and slaving in a shit job. I was constantly dreaming of this car I wanted (a classic), which wasn&#39;t even very expensive. I was researching it daily. Then one day I got paid and the money was on my account, I could have bought this car 5 times over. But the moment I saw that cash sitting on my account I lost all interest in that car. Funny that, I never bought it. Food for thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I think the current situation is very much like slavery.</p>

<p>Even most self-employed are actually just working/slaving for the bank that provides their credit (at any time the bank can close their business by denying credit etc.). </p>

<p>You&#39;re not paid in meals at the moment, but for many many people living paycheck to paycheck, it is basically the same thing: 100% of income goes to the basic needs like meals and housing and transport. </p>

<p>Everybody is temporarily embarrassed millionaires (not sure who first made up this quote) wishing for the ferrari, but the reality is that most by far never climb even one step higher on the social ladder than where they were born.</p>

<p>I once got a fair amount of cash from a company sale. Before the sale I was quite poor and slaving in a shit job. I was constantly dreaming of this car I wanted (a classic), which wasn&#39;t even very expensive. I was researching it daily. Then one day I got paid and the money was on my account, I could have bought this car 5 times over. But the moment I saw that cash sitting on my account I lost all interest in that car. Funny that, I never bought it. Food for thought.</p>
