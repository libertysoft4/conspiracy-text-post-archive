<p>His secretary of commerce pick is Wilbur Ross, a former Rothschild banker. Ross bailed Trump out of bankruptcy in the early 90’s. When asked why, he referred to Trump as a great “asset”. Perhaps some foreshadowing and grooming going on here? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In this case, it is rather curious. If Q is not authorized by Trump, then at this point it has become big enough that his administration would have had someone look into it and find out what it was all about. If I was President and someone was convincing hundreds of thousands of people worldwide that they spoke with my authority, then I would view that as a potential threat. It would take 10 seconds for Sarah Sanders to make a comment that they are aware of the Q Anon movement and they have nothing to do with it. That would decimate Q followers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But why would they want to do that? </p>

<p>Q followers exist in a reality where the President has been chosen by God to lead America to glory against a horrifying child-sacrificing deep state cabal, and continually rationalize the failure for any of the huge Q promises to ever come true. It&#39;s a deluded mass of people who genuinely believe a government insider is communicating to them on 8 Chan.</p>

<p>We&#39;re talking about a movement which started with the claim of HRC heading to Gitmo and riots that would follow, followed by the HRC raw tape that would drop and shock the world, or the Obama AK-47 photo, or the secret second memo or... well, you get the point. </p>

<p>Results don&#39;t matter to these people. They&#39;re the perfect political audience. Do nothing, and they&#39;ll double down and believe more. For Trump to acknowledge or deny them is to risk losing their unquestioning support. </p>

<p>If anything I&#39;d imagine the administration has adopted a zoo policy - look, but don&#39;t touch. </p>

<p>And I highly doubt, after a string of broken promises and failed events, that the Q faithful would be decimated by Sarah Sanders. I anything they&#39;d go for a whole &#39;disinformation is necessary&#39; angle and keep on trucking. C&#39;mon. They already think Trump sends them secret numerical messages, and secret hand signals. </p>

<p>These are not people troubled by the burden of proof. It&#39;s pretty much win-win for the administration to let the carry on. </p>

If you let people develop their own conclusion, and just keep feeding them vague poems, they&#39;ll make connections for themselves founded on the belief that they can&#39;t possibly have been duped so easily. Those psychics who pretend to tell you what your loved ones are saying from beyond the grave do the same thing, there was a pretty good south park episode about it. And lol, wouldn&#39;t you know it, the conclusion is that the people being tricked still don&#39;t get it even when it&#39;s being explained to them. Life&#39;s funny that way.</p>

<p>Sure more people are insured (whether they can afford it or not and have to pay the being alive tax) but has the death rate in America gone down?</p>

<p>Because you&#39;re talking out of your ass.  Thanks to finding a way to pay insurance companies rather than making medical treatment affordable, President Not Allowed To Mock HIS Skin Color managed to obliterate the middle class and make the poor poorer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There likely would be some cronyism, but not in the same areas that Trump cronyism is taking place. </p>

<p>As far as &quot;more wars&quot; you have no evidence that that would take place, meanwhile Trump has tossed around ideas of coups in South America and more engagement in Syria, so that line of reasoning falls flat.</p>

<p>Regarding trade policies, TPP may have happened to <em>strengthen</em> us against China instead of Trump&#39;s trade war. And do you honestly think Trump can renegotiate NAFTA? He&#39;s already shown how incompetent he is in regards to the negotiations and his belief that he can bully other countries the same way he used to bully small businesses.</p>

<p>Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I didn&#39;t vote for Hillary, but this &quot;both sides are the same&quot; false dichotomy needs to go. There are very different policies that would be enacted under a Democrat than a Republican, and to say otherwise is downright dishonest.</p>

<p>Majority of America does. I don&#39;t see the point. Swamp creatures need to be loyal in addition to being a millionaire for Trump to let them stick around.</p>

<p>Sorry, but this isn&#39;t reflected in any available metrics mate... This isn&#39;t reality. Even the popular electoral vote was carried by Clinton, by millions, and it&#39;s been pretty much downhill from there for Trump in terms of popularity.</p>

Since they are unwilling to be deceived, they are unwilling to be convinced that they have been deceived. Therefore, they hate the truth for the sake of whatever it is that they love in place of the truth. They love truth when she shines on them; and hate her when she rebukes them.</p>

<p>most presidents tend to do the stuff that rocks the boat in their second term, or likely in trumps case the last few months of his first term.</p>

<p>no sense pissing everyone off early on in first 4 years when he can wait till the last year after hes gotten some actual legislation passed. the Democrats made it overly clear they would never work with him so he might as well get the swamp to do some work before he pisses them all off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because there’s nothing to them. If there was, “they” would have already used them against him.</p>

<p>They tried to bring him down with rape accusations including the 13 year old who he supposedly raped with Epstein but all of those allegations fell apart before the election.</p>

<p>All they could dig up was raw dogging a porn star and a Playboy model and then paying them to shut up about it.</p>

<p>Back to OP’s original point, Trump’s cabinet IS full of scumbags.</p>

<p>Those mentioned + John Bolton, Nikki Haley, Betsy DeVos, Steve Mnuchin, Mike Pompeo.</p>

<p>I suspect that many of these people are recommended to Trump by the party and other deep state groups (AIPAC, CFR, etc.). </p>

<p>Especially considering that Trump didn’t come from Washington or the political scene.</p>

<p>If the “anonymous” op-ed is true, then many of these same people are working against his administration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great, show me the odds. Monsters have leashes and work at the behest of the president, he can sack any of them at anytime. Explain how Bolton was instrumental in the NK deal. He&#39;s a war hawk isn&#39;t he? Or is he just clearing the NSA of trash? Why is sessions still there when trump attacks him at least once a week, same as Mueller - he can sack any of them at anytime why not? Theatre, he keeps the press attacking him and leaving his people to do their jobs. Check Pacer for the number of indictments btw, on average 25% of annual indictments are criminal - let&#39;s be generous let&#39;s say 10% - 5k potential criminal indictments - look up the average indictments per year, the % criminal.

<p>Trump has surrounded himself with more politicians, lobbyists and business associates with highly dubious connections, backgrounds and motives...because</p>

<p>Is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Napolitano">Janet Napolitano</a> a &quot;banker&quot;?  Is Ken Salazar a &quot;banker&quot;?</p>

<p>Was this email list from a secretive executive at Citigroup, one who Obama could not say no to?  </p>

<p>Or was it sent from Michael Froman (who worked at Citibank at the time and was a longtime government finance/economist and an official part of the Obama transition team) who was supplying a list of potential Cabinet and admin candidates to help the transition team group advise the President Elect. This list was focused on diversity for candidate selections.  It also lists multiple candidates for many of the positions, some of which were not chosen.  </p>

<p>Does it seem odd that key Cabinet and administration positions would be discussed even prior to winning the election?  Seems like something people (like the transition team) would be discussing, as to be more prepared for the job ahead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People seem to think that he was an independent but really he is a party political man. The same 2 party system has won all the elections. I don&#39;t understand why people keep falling for the same rhetoric. We had &quot;new labour&quot; as some kind of clean sweep sold to the British public but really it was just the same old war and lies. I think the pendulum swings both ways but it&#39;s just to keep people thinking there is progress and change. One side undoes the work of the other to maintain the status quo. I don&#39;t even find trump that different from the other buffoons voted into office.  In the UK they have been doing the resign so the deputy gets a go. I foresee &quot;business as usual&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is more of an independent, really. He has drifted around between different parties over the years. Do you not see the problem with hour statement? The two party system has a stranglehold on the electoral system, which is why the best chance of real reform is to sneak someone in through one of the major parties. This is why Ron Paul ran as a Republican. Trump is playing the Republican side to get the results that he wants, some of which agrees with traditional conservative politics, some of which does not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dam, I’ve heard you guys are out there but this is some stereotypical trumptard BS.</p>

<p>Are you really trying to argue Trump is good because “the guys got more clout then you posting on a forum.”? You should maybe check that bar you’re setting for the POTUS... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I voted for trump based of his character and history with business  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of all the reason you could have given this is the worst. At least if you’d maybe said his rhetoric on the TPP and cutting funding to “moderate”rebels in Syria, you might have been on to something.
But nope, you vote for the guy based on his multiple bankruptcies and loveable character which brought us wholesome quotes such as: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything”....”Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp; on his own daughter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>”I don&#39;t think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine. Although she does have a very nice figure. I&#39;ve said that if Ivanka weren&#39;t my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah okay, the guys with the strong rapey vibe and associate of pedophiles (buds with Epstein and Clinton), has a character worth voting for as the POTUS. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reagan was in the same boat and he turned out pretty well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, trickle down economics and the war on drugs have turned out great, right?</p>

<p>You understand it’s possible to not believe the official stories around JFK &amp; 9/11 and still be able to recognise Trump is just a greedy asshole looking out for himself and serving the same corporate overlords that a long line of presidents served before him.</p>

<p>I’ve got 2 questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>How old are you?</li>
<li>Did you pay attention to politics or conspiracy theory before 2016?</li>

<p>A cheater, liar and adulterer who bankrupted his and others&#39; businesses many times over.</p>

<p><em>That&#39;s</em> the kind of character you admire.</p>

<p>Okay, &quot;libs will keep their dicks and solve the transgender problem&quot; and &quot;rednecks will blow their dick off because they love Trump&quot;. Does that garbage take about sum you up? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They were just jokes, making fun of people who hate Trump so much that they will do the opposite of what he tells them to do, people who love Trump so much that they will do anything he tells them to do, inbred hillbillies and people who don&#39;t like guys who have gender reassignment surgery.</p>

<p>Yes, I was making fun of both sides but not with the intention of being an edgelord. People are so hyper-partisan that if you only make fun of one side you will be accused of stanning for Trump or Hillary. By joking about both sides I was hoping to avoid that.</p>

<p>As for Jordan Peterson, I haven&#39;t watched/listened to/read any of his material this year and last year I was only interested in his psychology and religion work, not his political commentary. I prefer to stick with mindfulness and Buddhist material. If that happens to coincide with Peterson then so be it. I didn&#39;t realize that Peterson did the whole &quot;I&#39;m edging both political sides look at meeee&quot; thing. For someone who isn&#39;t a fan, you seem to know quite a lot about him (including his life changing &quot;wash your sweaty balls&quot; lessons)</p>

<p>You mean, you were hoping to score dunks on both for the sake of some &quot;enlightened centrism&quot; that carefully stands for nothing.</p>

<p>Oh, here since you seem to dig east asian philosophy here&#39;s a salient one from Sun Tzu that fits my reasoning about knowing dumb shit like the Bible and hucksters like Peterson: &quot;If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.&quot; </p>

<p>Anyone who reads that tripe can paint Jesus as a filthy tree-hugging bleeding heart high-tax advocating socialist and Peterson as nothing more than a semi-educated parent with an open thesaurus that has a stanky teen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Typically what you&#39;ll see in politics are people we might consider to be political elites...  no shocks or surprises there.</p>

<p>And its true that Trump is not a political elite.  He doesn&#39;t resemble the same kind of character as many &quot;for-life&quot; politicians who can be attributed to controlling a large portion of society for generations.  He&#39;s hardly had a hand in any sort of political game, ever.</p>

<p>Which means that we have an <em>economic</em> elite who has tricked the populace into correctly believing that, because he is indeed not a political elite, he is on the side of the common man.  All the while just being another icon of control, just not someone who begun in the political sphere.  So its easier to spread the lie that he&#39;s on your side when he&#39;s really not.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Contrary to what a lot of people might believe in this subreddit I don&#39;t necessarily believe that an elite is out to harm society or destroy it.  But every elite is subject to scrutiny and can easily be controlled by the world that surrounds them, just as much as they themselves try to control the world.  </p>

<p>But it does take a special kind of character to not fall-in-line with the will of one group over the will of another.  That&#39;s probably why most of the people with super powers in the Marvel Universe are villains rather than heroes.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s a pretty simple way to snuffing out corruption in politics:  Look for the people who are trying to make life easier for everyone rather than neglecting their constituents for personal gain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am seeing the comments that people do not &quot;get&quot; why people support Trump/Qanon etc. and do not believe that the &quot;swamp&quot; is being drained. Ask yourself this...why has ALL the media seemed so desperate to stop the President? You do realize of course that he did not need $ from special interest to run for the office and that he used millions of his own $ to pay for his campaign? You do realize that there are 50,000 sealed indictments ( and climbing) when on average there are usually only a little over 1,000? (you can verify this on gov&#39;t. websites) So what has changed, hmmm? You do realize (as someone else commented) that President Trump wants term limits for Congress ? You do realize that we are in the best economy in forever, that unemployment is way down and the media will not talk about all the good things that are happening and why not? Have you checked your 401K recently? You do realize that North Korea is no longer a viable threat (but the media will not talk about it , they would rather promote hysteria) and why couldn&#39;t past Presidents do this? Then ask yourself WHY there are so many politicians and CEO&#39;s stepping down like never before in history? Does it make sense that they would if they thought the President was so awful? Why wouldn&#39;t they stay put instead? Ask yourself WHY the military was gutted before and ask yourself if you feel safer with a strong military that we now have? Ask yourself if &quot;open&quot; borders are what you want and why the media and certain Democrats are so set on abolishing ICE and keeping the borders open? Ask yourself why our mfg. base was so eroded when it did not need to be? And in case you did not know...The United States just passed Russia and Saudi Arabia as the worlds #1 oil producer and why didn&#39;t this happen before? Yes President Trump can come off as a jerk when he tweets but then he was never a polished politician to begin with and his supporters are fed up with the same self serving politicians. Step back and use some logic. Something is off when there is such hatred for our President by the media. Could it be that they are ALL far left supporters...like HELLO? Pretty obvious when conservative voices are being shut down all over and violent groups like ANTIFA are given a free pass and yeah, it&#39;s ok for all those left leaning Hollywood dopes to spew hatred all over social media. And the truth is coming out (although the media does not want to talk about it) that the so called &quot;Russian collusion&quot; was a setup by the Democrats and the upper echelons of the F.B.I etc.( that they had in their pockets) that it was nothing but a lie to stop President Trump? When all is said and done (and it will be as this is going to be way bigger than Watergate ever was) maybe then, you will understand.</p>

I, for one, already have thought about all that and have still come to the conclusion that Trump is not the good guy and his admin is filled with swampy creatures.

    <div class="md"><p>To answer..broader picture. Yes I agree that here are swampy creatures in this administration. Some appointments may be to appease the GOP, but maybe the possibility is there that some of these creatures will turn on the swamp.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying that either party is immune to swap creatures, but believing that Trump drained the swamp is just delusional at best. Sure a lot of people don&#39;t like him in both parties, but I&#39;m not a member of either party and I don&#39;t like him. You don&#39;t even have to be political to hate him, you just gotta listen to the guy and read about his history and shady business past and boom! Instant disgust. It&#39;s clear the type of people who buy into him or Q&#39;s crap and eagerly wait for him to &quot;destroy&quot; the government system. Hell, I&#39;m all for breaking the establishment, but I don&#39;t for one second believe it will be Trump. Sorry. And if I&#39;m wrong, if Trump does somehow miraculously pull it off, shiiiiiiit I might just believe in God again. Doubt it though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are plenty of good people trapped in a bad system. Not saying any of the above are good people, but they might be. Also, Trump knows a lot of these people personally, and he’s made it clear that whoever works for him should be a patriot, willing to take a pay cut from their former lives, and make sacrifices for the USA. Trump wants the best money-people working for the US government. He’s recruiting the meanest and most ruthless money masters to work FOR the USA instead of themselves. Unless of course, everything is a lie. But anyhow, that’s the logic. If you want the best people on your economic team, hire from the best banking establishments. It’s like football or basketball or any sport— some of those people are literally thugs, and bad people, but they’re damn good at the sport. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was on the Trump train. In 2000 I made up my mind to forever vote against all incumbents so long as our foreign policy remains so belligerent.</p>

<p>So upon voting in 2016 Trump was an obvious choice for me, as he had zero public service record I felt like the dumb and dumber &quot;so theres a chance&quot; meme.</p>

<p>Like with Obama, I fell off the train immediately upon reading about his cabinet choices. </p>

<p>It feels like no matter how you vote, incumbent or not, its always the same damn people in the end.</p>

<p>I am however encouraged by the deescalation in Korea. Even the worst victims of Trump derangement syndrome have to count that as an achievement?.. right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because Trump has always been controlled opposition as well. Principled conservatives saw it during the election and some of them didn&#39;t vote at all or wrote in one of the other Republican candidates.</p>

<p>Many like me have known this. The main reason conservatives support Trump, however, is because whether it&#39;s fake or real, he stands up for their values, and has placed himself as their champion. So when the far left attacks the values of The Right or moderates, Trump usually makes a speech or tweet defending them. So that is why so many hang on to him, even if they feel voting for him was a mistake. It&#39;s why some never-trumpers like myself have started to at least approve of his surface actions; he is a symbol we can&#39;t deny.</p>

<p>So until the far left stops being far left and stops attacking conservatives and their values, Trump will always be doubled down on and no conservative will be convinced to publicly denounce Trump</p>

<p>With Trump it&#39;s just another empty suit constantly spouting bullshit from the mouth. These people say anything to get elected and then they simply don&#39;t care. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump should drain the pond. Although, he is an oversized rabbid fish chasing green rubber worms around (think money), kind of like the old Nirvana album art with the baby chasing the dollar on a hook...not to far from the truth except it is the lovers of money chasing the worm and all those who they are successful at causing to do the same. I suppose if he drained the pond though he wouldnt do too well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you’re just extending this <em>extremely</em> generous benefit of the doubt to the president, because you bought his “rah rah” campaign promises and got caught up in all the fun.</p>

<p>The people at r/conspiracy are more skeptical of politicians, people in power, and the ruling class. </p>

<p>A cabinet full of Goldman Sachs, Bilderberg, and Rothschild banker should have been a warning sign for you. All of the authoritarian policies should have made you at least question your devotion. </p>

<p>Can you justify any of these ? How is this making America great again? </p>
