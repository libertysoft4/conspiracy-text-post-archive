        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>SS:</p>

<p>Given the current spamming about GreatAwakening being banned, I figured it would be worth letting people know about this in case they weren&#39;t aware:</p>

<p>Jack Posobiec released this report last week. He has interviewed someone called Microchip who claims that he started QAnon and handed it over to a different group in November 2017. Microchip claims that he was also behind the Meganon LARP as well. I remember Meganon posting early this year or late last year saying that QAnon had changed and it was clear by the writing style. This claim makes more sense now. The report is here:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/aSDqBVVFfsM">https://youtu.be/aSDqBVVFfsM</a></p>

<p>Microchip has a Gab account. He has been posting information about Q and also arguing with the Q followers. The account is here:</p>

<p><a href="https://gab.ai/Microchip">https://gab.ai/Microchip</a></p>

<p>Microchip recorded his iPhone screen and showed his Discord chat logs from August 2017 to October 2017. They are linking to their 4chan Q posts and discussing what they should post next based on how much traction the other various 4chan &quot;insiders&quot; and topics got.</p>

<p>Video 1:
<a href="https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1037775577577664512?s=09">https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1037775577577664512?s=09</a></p>

<p>Video 2:
<a href="https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1037776347312123905?s=09">https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1037776347312123905?s=09</a></p>

<p>Microchip has issued a challenge to Q:
<a href="https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1037765779155021825?s=09">https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/1037765779155021825?s=09</a></p>

<p>He linked to a Q post on 4chan, from 28th October 2017. 
Apparently, the ID of each post on 4chan is created from the IP address. 
Microchip has issued the challenge - post again from the same IP address (so that the post ID matches the one from 28th Oct 17) to prove that he is in fact the same person who posted 28th Oct 17.
Microchip claims that he was the one who posted it, before he passed Q on to whoever is running it now. 
He says that he used a throwaway VPN when posting so Q won&#39;t be able to post again from the IP address.</p>

<p>Assuming that Q is a LARP, I think that says quite a bit about whoever is behind it now. If they were MAGA guys then they are doing a lot of damage to the movement. Rather than confessing to the LARP, they are letting people believe that there are things happening behind the scenes, they are in control etc and this is probably going to make the MAGA people complacent. Rather than helping their local politicians (or doing anything productive), a lot of people are just sitting at home and fapping to the latest Q drops. This makes me think that they aren&#39;t interested in the MAGA movement. Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My response to a post on the same article a few moments ago:</p>

<p>Well that was misleading and anticlimactic.</p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to entertain the claim that Q is a combination of Dreamcatcher and Microchip, but the screenshots were never posted and the mentioned video is never linked.</p>

<p>The author goes on to claim that Q changed hands when it jumped to 8chan from 4chan, but doesn&#39;t explain who took over.</p>

<p>Again, willing to entertain this line of thought, I&#39;d just don&#39;t see anything in the article that proves or disproves who Q is either way.</p>

<p>Microchip says he has more proof which he&#39;ll post. He says he&#39;s doing it that way to let the people behind Q dig their own graves. Either he&#39;s telling the truth or he&#39;s full of shit trying to get attention</p>

<p>If he has proof, I&#39;m all ears. Looking into the logs now. My point was in the absence of said evidence, the article is all talk and requires a similar level of faith as that of a Q post. I appreciate the humor in that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the Jack Posobiec report is definitely lacking. The Discord chat logs are better, as is the Gab account. They don&#39;t conclusively prove anything but then neither do the Q posts.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s unrealistic to think that the hardcore Q followers will research the Gab account. They claim to independently research everything but I suspect that it is limited to things that back up their beliefs.</p>

<p>That wasn&#39;t the whole point of my question.</p>

<p>Do you really think it&#39;s impossible to fake the video?</p>

<p>that&#39;s the question.</p>

<p>You and I can certainly feel the dilemma you&#39;re in right now.</p>

<p>First possibility:</p>

<p>You really want Q to be a Larp, and you need this video to prove it.</p>

<p>That means you have to rule out that it can be fake, but that makes you look like an idi0t.</p>

<p>Second possibility: </p>

<p>Admit that this video could be fake but then you opened this thread for nothing and you can&#39;t prove that Q is a Larp (that also makes you look like an idiot).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sound like a cult member. Cults resort to trying to devalue outsiders. &quot;Normie&quot; and &quot;Too lazy&quot; are transparent attempts at this. Cults also create their own vocabulary (including taking normal words and phrases but give them a different meaning). &quot;4am talking points&quot; seems to fit that.</p>
