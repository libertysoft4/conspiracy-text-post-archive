        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yes, I was pissed off yesterday when the cowards and shills who have infiltrated Reddit like a cancer and the satanists and cannibals who run Reddit conspired together to take down all the &quot;Q&quot;-related subs yesterday. </p>

<p>And yes, it was frustrating to see the influx of TuMOR-types to this sub yesterday, attacking GA and Q with the evil glee that fuels low-level demons and toadies. </p>

<p>But let&#39;s face it: If you know &quot;The Art of War,&quot; this is all signs of a losing team. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>At your weakest, appear strong--if they were strong, they wouldn&#39;t have to censor. If they were strong, they wouldn&#39;t have their team of MSM parrots attacking a subreddit in some of the nation&#39;s largest publications. </p></li>
<li><p>Control communications. The #1 thing an occupying force does when it takes over a nation is commandeer the media. The bad guys have controlled media for a loooong time, but they&#39;re losing their hold by the day. When you have to shut down a subreddit with less than 100K subscribers (though I bet it was more and the liars who run Reddit were throttling it, but whatever), you are showing your hand and it&#39;s a weak one. </p></li>
<li><p>Chessboard moves and countermoves--Does anybody actually think the Q team wasn&#39;t anticipating this? Of course they were. It will be fun to see what happens next and watch the cancers, shills and MSM parrots sputter and protest like the impotent limp dicks they are. </p></li>
<li><p>The ugly shadow monster is being forced to rear its many heads. The Deep State works best when it&#39;s just that: Deep. Operating below the public radar, in darkness. Between that treasonous NYT Op-Ed, the obviously controlled MSM talking points on pretty much any everything, the social media clampdown and now Reddit&#39;s censorship roll, the Deep State is being forced to emerge from the shadows. They don&#39;t like it, which is why they&#39;re being so gross and pissy about it. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>So take a step back. Look at all that&#39;s been accomplished in the past year--even the past week! Did you see all the key corporate resignations? Another half dozen--Leslie Moonves at CBS, but also &quot;60 Minutes&quot; top executive producer and sex freak Jeff Fagler; Jack Ma of Alibaba; Tim Armstrong of Oath/HuffPo/AOL (back in the day). </p>

<p>Bad guys are losing, and losing badly. Their fuse is running short. Their impotent anger, like a baby&#39;s temper tantrum, in their failure to achieve universal evil and sexual abuse, is what we need to be concerned about: They hate everything, including themselves, and will do whatever they can to ruin as much as they can before they are ultimately defeated. </p>

<p>But ultimately defeated they will be. Because they&#39;re already defeated. They are losers, inherently. Losers, losers, losers. </p>

<p>Have a great day! God loves you! </p>

<p>I mean it&#39;s insanely easy to discredit the &quot;Q movement&quot; or whatever</p>

<p>All you have to do is ask for a single time where Q promised something and it happened. Like the BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. week where nothing happened</p>

<p>Or last friday where he said to &quot;grab a bag of popcorn&quot;</p>

<p>Or how monday was supposed to be the day everything finally went down</p>

<p>His first EVER post was saying that HRC would be imprisoned a week from that post. That was in Oct of 2017. What happened? Why do you keep letting him lie and string you along like an absentee parent promising he&#39;ll be there on christmas day?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean honestly is there any reason that he couldn’t have just been spamming f5 and then post right after he sees the Trump tweet?</p>

<p>And even if like Q is a secret service guy who is just near trump a lot, nothing that he’s actually promised will happen has happened. Nothing big, at least. I’ve been following the Q subs for 6+ months and every week there has been a vague event that will happen in 5-10 days that will finally be when the big shit goes down. But it never does, the window stays as a vague future event and nothing truly ever happens</p>

<p>I think if you cannot generate political impetus for a subject it is less likely to manifest in Washington D.C.  If they aren&#39;t  informed that people want specific action, the politicians in Washington, DC would rather sit on their hands and let someone else &quot;do it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;HRC extradition already in motion effective yesterday with several countries in case of cross border run. Passport approved to be flagged effective 10/30 @ 12:01am. Expect massive riots organized in defiance and others fleeing the US to occur. US M’s will conduct the operation while NG activated.

Reddit has banned the second-largest pro-President Trump subreddit, The Great Awakening, as tech platforms increasingly ban Trump-supporting and conservative forums.</p>

<p>Top Reddit moderators made Big League Politics aware of the fact that “The Great Awakening” was banned Tuesday night at 11:45 PM. The subreddit has been down all day.</p>

<p>The Great Awakening subreddit served as an informal platform for followers of the Q Anon movement, as well as for other independent researchers.</p>

<p>Top Reddit moderators have provided Big League Politics with information showing that left-wing operatives including an employee of CBS have been involved in posing as Trump supporters to post offensive anonymous content on Reddit in order to get pro-Trump subreddits flagged. BLP will be rolling out that information today as this censorship purge goes into high gear.</p>

<p>The CBS employee has been identified by top Reddit moderators as Gary Phillips, who serves as digital media administrator for CBS Studios International in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Phillips runs a private subreddit in which he makes clear his liberal ideology, and plans his covert actions against Trump subreddits according to copious information reviewed by the editorial staff. </p>

<p>&quot;More than 30 covert left-wing actors have been identified coordinating with Phillips, including activists linked to Media Matters and the ACLU.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no, they called for Hillary to be put to trial for her crimes. I never once read a comment advocating for someone to take that into their own hands and not have her brought to justice.</p>

<p>Or are you so sloppy that you couldn&#39;t figure it out?</p>

<p>Also, if that is grounds for hating a community and banning a subject, how do you feel about the comments made about Trump in a place like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>? I have seem comments detailing some pretty horrific things there in reference to what people would like to do to Trump.... I guess those don&#39;t matter because hurting Trump is okay?</p>

<p>If all the subs were getting shut down for this stuff, I could understand it, but this is targeted on one subject and nowhere else. Anybody can go to any sub and post something horrible. The fact that you think that is &#39;proof&#39; shows your intellectual inability.</p>

<p>Well hey i guess you know it all, don&#39;t you? What&#39;s hilarious is that you are just as ridiculous as the people you try to denigrate. You are as sure that Q is a LARP as they are that Q is real - you&#39;re both fools. The only honest answer here is &#39;wait and see&#39;.

<p>So much wrong here. &#39;vast parts of the country&#39;? hell no. I don&#39;t even think i&#39;d say &#39;vast parts of government&#39;. Q is backed by patriots within - there are more good guys than bad IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are theories. It is true to say that it is quite unlikely that we will watch something as complex as even a bacterium emerge from a molecular soup in a laboratory for the reasons outlined above, but that doesn&#39;t mean that we cannot use the scientific method to determine the most likely origin of life, based on our observations. And of course your description of it leaves out all the beautiful, intricate details - this is a problem that has been thought and reasoned about - you might be interested to read more about the theories. All it takes is the emergence of a single self-replicator, at which point the laws of probability no longer apply. Billions of years and vast oceans of chemicals seems sufficient to me for the emergence of one.</p>

Short answer, I feel that anticipatory design is evidence in nature in a way that would not occur naturally for &quot;trial and error&quot; style macroevolution and used giraffes as an example.</p>

<p>Yes, I have been using wikipedia since the week it opened.  Guess what though?  Modern academia is wrong about some stuff.  For a long time now we thought the speed of light was a constant; modern testing now shows the speed of light is slowing down.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why I stopped calling myself &quot;atheist&quot; a long time ago.</p>

<p>As science becomes dogma to some, atheists then feel the need to attack religion because it&#39;s like an Easter Bunny fairy tale in their worldview that just can&#39;t be *logical, rational or true*.</p>

<p>But they are really just attacking their own spirituality, of which their dogmas are rooted in. Is the Big Bang a noble lie? Lots of folks are lost in this weird battle of doing what Alan Watts puts simply as &quot;playing hide and seek with God&quot;.</p>

<p>I can see it in Jordan Peterson, he&#39;s trying to convey this message as well, but he&#39;s having a really hard time doing it because he hasn&#39;t reached a point where it all crystallizes and becomes a clear concept that&#39;s easy to convey. He has a lot of stuff to work through before he gets there, because he has a lot of sources to draw from when formulating ideas, but I think he will gain the enlightenment through that journey, so even though I&#39;m critical of Peterson and his rambling, I think the message he&#39;s trying to bring about is ultimately very important for a society that is losing touch with spirituality.</p>

<p>Much of western society has only experienced spirituality through strange constructs like drug addiction, religion, cults, tree hugging, and brand worship. These constructs harness people&#39;s innate and likely suppressed spirituality which wants to come to the surface because it is at least half of who/what we are. Not many people can recognize that and there is no current science or philosophy to back this up yet, so they are deep in the unknown.</p>

<p>The point of life is not physical, it is spiritual, or a good mix of both.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ofc they are.  Look most people who believe in the big bang are religious whether they believe so or not.  Its a theory.  No one can honestly say with 100% certainty thats how it went down.  Even if they are 99.9% certain theres still that .1% of doubt.  And thats where faith comes in.  These people have faith that its 100% true even though it hasnt been proven to be 100% true.  Thus, their god and religion is science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Abiogenesis and evolution are all that are needed. It begins with the first self-replicating molecule, which catalyzes the creation of many copies of itself. Some of these copies grow in length, or join with other molecules to produce yet more complex ones.

But I guess they amaze many scientists as well.  </p>

<p>Do you think there is a symbiotic relationship between plants and animals and how do you figure one survived without the other if they evolved at generally different times?  Not just pollination concerns, but things like CO2 &lt;--&gt; O2 balance?  </p>

<p>Abiogenesis and evolution are all that are needed.</p>

<p>Has either one of these ever been observed in all of history?  I agree with you that adaptation occurs, we can see it in finches or fruit flies or whatever.  But has anybody witnessed an animal becoming a new kind of animal?  A finch may develop a longer or shorter beak based on environmental pressures, but when has a finch ever become a bunny?  There&#39;s actually zero observational proof that this or anything like it has ever occurred.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ever since Darwin, evolutionists have almost universally maintained that the supposed change from one basic type of organism to another occurred slowly, gradually, in tiny steps. The fossils did not support this idea, and Darwin blamed incompleteness of the record. Others repeated this excuse, right up to the present day, including Richard Dawkins, the ‘archbishop of atheism’ at Oxford University in the UK.</p>

<p>Gould and Niles Eldredge, a former student of Gould, actually faced up to the fossil record and decided it did not support the gradualist dogma. They argued strongly against some of the classical claims of gradual transformation. In doing this they were inadvertently agreeing with creationists. Naturally, creationists used their admissions.</p>

<p>In 1977 Gould wrote,</p>

<p>‘The <strong>extreme rarity of transitional forms in the fossil record persists as the trade secret of paleontology.</strong> … to preserve our favored account of evolution by natural selection we view our data as so bad that we never see the very process we profess to study.’</p>

<p>In 1980 Gould said,</p>

<p>‘The absence of fossil evidence for intermediary stages between major transitions in organic design, indeed our inability, even in our imagination, to construct functional intermediates in many cases, has been a persistent and nagging problem for gradualistic accounts of evolution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I might guess that adaptation is part of the grand design and that evolution of &quot;new kinds&quot; of animals has never actually been observed and is therefore not scientific.</p>

<p>You could change any of these laws, however, and everything would still perfectly &#39;fit together&#39; - it just wouldn&#39;t look like our universe. And life arises in a so-called &#39;goldilocks zone&#39; simply because it (as far as we understand) would be difficult or impossible to arise anywhere else in a universe governed by the laws this one is governed by. That is not to say that life cannot exist in other universes that look nothing like our own (though the life would be unlike any we know as well). Any conceivable universe is &#39;perfect&#39; in this regard - in that everything &#39;fits together&#39;.  </p>

<p>We can reason about evolution based on our understanding of the constituent processes. Same too for abiogenesis. Sure, there&#39;s a possibility that we don&#39;t have the full picture (in fact we almost certainly do not) but it is absolutely the most coherent explanation for all observational data. Do you have an alternate theory that better explains the diversity of life on Earth, that is rooted in observation and deduction?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everywhere I look in nature I see anticipatory design.  Did you know a giraffe has insanely high blood pressure, as is necessary to get oxygenated blood up to its brain?  Makes sense right?  </p>

<p>But when the giraffe bends over to drink, this could cause it to pass out due to that super high blood pressure.  There&#39;s actually a valve that temporarily shuts off blood flow when the giraffe bends down to drink.  </p>

<p>But this would cause the giraffe to pass out too, because its brain needs blood.  Makes sense right?  So there&#39;s a sponge like material  that gets filled with extra blood and provides the brain oxygen while the giraffe is drinking and the blood valve is closed.</p>

<p>Then there is another valve that slowly opens as the giraffe lifts its head so that blood flow can gradually resume from the circulatory system.</p>

<p>The interesting thing about this is how many different systems are involved here.  It isn&#39;t just one &quot;adaptation&quot; like a longer beak that instantly helps the next generation.  These are multiple systems being worked on simultaneously - none of these so called &quot;adaptations&quot; would offer ANY evolutionary advantage unless they ALL arrived on the scene at the exact same time.  </p>

<p>To me that suggests intelligence design, which is apparent in all of nature if we look hard enough.</p>

<p>But just for the sake of discussion, let&#39;s hypothetically say that such a giraffe was born, from a random mutation, with ALL of these extra features in one generation, even though it is unlikely.  Remember, they all need to be present simultaneously for it to assist the giraffe in staying alive, so it&#39;s unlikely for all these mutations to come in separately over the years.  So this giraffe mutates and has the necessary features to have a long neck and to drink water without passing out and still get blood to its brain when standing up.  Now it needs to find a compatible female AND have the adaptive genes dominantly express themselves every single time?  </p>

<p>Does that make ANY sense?  And there is no transition fossil whatsoever to show this giraffe&#39;s ancestors gradually coming onto the scene without these features?  </p>

<p>I posit that evolution really doesn&#39;t explain species writ large.  The only thing that exists is &quot;micro-evolution&quot; i.e. adaptation.  Small changes, but a bird stays a bird and a giraffe stays a giraffe.  The large changes have anticipatory design and are part of a greater design.  Just my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not an expert, so you&#39;ll have to bear with me here. But yes, my understanding is that the fossil record is used to demonstrate those &#39;small changes&#39; you mentioned accumulating over very long periods of time. It&#39;s imperfect, of course (we cannot peer back into time with perfect accuracy, naturally). But we can deduce that species are descended from others based on the age of the remains we find and their similarities. When we consider the likelihood of a particular theory being correct, we need to look at the alternatives. Is it possible that a divine being created all of these seeming intermediate organisms and killed them off/hid their remains at just the right time to make it seem as if one evolved from the other? Sure. Is it likelier than the process of natural selection changing the offspring of each organism gradually over time? I&#39;ll leave that to you. Since we don&#39;t see any experimental evidence of a mechanism that could be employed by such a divine being to create organisms out of thin air, while the theory of evolution is 100% physically possible based on all observational data, I am inclined to believe the latter.  </p>

<p>Certainly!  You&#39;re one of the most chill people I&#39;ve met recently on reddit and I&#39;m thoroughly enjoying our discussion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But we can deduce that species are descended from others based on the age of the remains we find and their similarities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s the best way to determine age if the fossils are dated by the layers in which they&#39;re found and the layers are dated by the fossils which are found in it?  Isn&#39;t that a bit of circular reasoning?</p>

<p>I might be pretty confused why things like petrified clams are found on the top of mount Everest if layering is true as classically taught.  </p>

<p>When it comes to vestigial organs, while it&#39;s a good point, it ultimately comes from what I believe is a misunderstanding  - again, academia getting stuff wrong through assumptions.  The human appendix has served as a textbook example of a vestigial organ thought to have no current function - I was taught this in school. Research has since shown that it serves multiple uses in the human digestive and immune systems and may even have a role in balancing the gut microbiome.</p>

<p>Regarding &quot;Whale Hips&quot; and the so called vestigal legs, those aren&#39;t really legs either.  Have you seen just how small those are?  According to relatively new USC research, those are mounting points for pelvic muscles.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Publishing in the journal Evolution, evolutionary biologists analyzed the sizes of whale reproductive organs, comparing them to whole body and pelvic girdle sizes. They wrote, “Whatever the underlying cause, we hypothesized that species with relatively large [male sexual organs] must have relatively large ischiocavernosus muscles..., which in turn require relatively large pelvic bones to serve as anchors.”</p>

<p>Scientists have not yet observed how these colossal creatures reproduce, but it stands to reason given the great distance between their eyes and reproductive organs that male whales likely need an extra measure of control during the mating process—and bigger pelvic bones lead to increased control. Mathew Dean, of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, co-authored the Evolution report.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Honestly, a bolstered pelvic girdle makes more sense to me than does a whale allegedly coming from <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Mesonychids&amp;amp;atb=v108-3&amp;amp;iax=images&amp;amp;ia=images">this</a> or <a href="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/chapter14-121008223324-phpapp02/95/bio-100-chapter-14-4-728.jpg?cb=1349735771">this</a></p>

<p>The most telling reason of all for these &quot;vestigial legs&quot; being related to the pelvic floor and related sexual organs and not legs at all?  The fact that they&#39;re different in modern male and female whales.  </p>

<p>The lack of transitional forms in the fossil record was realized by evolutionary whale experts like the late E.J. Slijper: ‘We do not possess a single fossil of the transitional forms between the aforementioned land animals [i.e., carnivores and ungulates] and the whales.’</p>

<p>A lot of the transitional fossils are guesses that are later proven wrong and never corrected.  Here is one alleged <a href="https://creation.com/images/book_chapters/refuting_evolution/pakicetus.gif">whale transitional fossil</a></p>

<p>Top left: Gingerich’s first reconstruction</p>

<p>Bottom left: what he had actually found</p>

<p>Top right: more complete skeleton</p>

<p>Bottom right: more reasonable reconstruction</p>

<p>What happened, and I say this with kindness, is that Darwin proposed a theory for which there was insufficient evidence. </p>

<p>He assumed that the evidence (transition fossils) would be filled in during later generations - I think there&#39;s a quote to this effect?  In the last 130 years there have been many attempts to do this, and some of them intentional frauds.  Like the piltdown man for example.  There have been entire skeletons reconstructed from a single pig&#39;s tooth and then called another animal, or animal fossils from 20 feet apart in the different layers claimed to be the same skeleton.  Even modern atheist palentologists say that &quot;The Lack of transitional fossils is somewhat of a trade secret&quot; (paraphrased from Gould) </p>

<p>Also interesting is that Darwin was a Creationist for the first 40 years of his life and went through a dark period where his faith was shaken for economic reasons and came out the other end essentially believing the pop science of the time, especially Charles Lyell&#39;s Principles of Geology book.  While it&#39;s certainly Darwin&#39;s right to believe whatever he wants, I question how much of it he really got right, especially since his assumption was that hard archaeological and fossil proof would arrive after his death.  He readily admitted that he couldn&#39;t prove everything while he was alive, and just hoped that the situation would change.  </p>

<p>As for why the entire world has embraced the theory, well, it&#39;s a pretty nice idea to imagine that we don&#39;t owe allegiance to anything or anyone greater than ourselves and that morality is subjective and not objective.  But is that really true?  </p>

<p>No, we use relative and radiometric dating to determine the age of a fossil.  </p>

<p>Can you articulate why? Besides, there are countless examples of vestigial organs. And a vestigial organ does not have to serve no purpose, only that the purpose has changed over time. An example is the tailbones that humans have that are exactly homologous to the tailbones of closely related primates. Those bones serve as an anchor point for some tendons now. Here&#39;s a list of vestigial organs in just one species, ours: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_vestigiality">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_vestigiality</a></p>

<p>And again, we can see in the fossils traces of these organs diminishing over time, as one species evolves into another. Take a look at a giraffe&#39;s laryngeal nerve - it is to my mind clear evidence that this organism was not &#39;designed&#39;, as it makes a 15&#39; detour on the wrong side of its body. As I said, I could provide countless examples of these abnormalities.</p>

<p>This raises an interesting question - did your intelligent designer kill off all of the intermediate species and make new ones that looked much like the former, or did it create all of the species at once and then manipulate the fossil record to make it appear as if they arrived and died off in succession? Did humans appear out of thin air just as <em>Homo heidelbergensis</em> was dying off? There are so many holes here. These, I think, are the questions you really need to address.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But is that really true?</p>

<p>Even if somehow evolution were disproved, how would that then require that an intelligent designer is required? It could certainly be some other mechanism of natural law that produced the species. And furthermore, how it would it mean that &quot;we owe allegiance to something or someone greater than ourselves and that morality is objective and not subjective&quot;? That&#39;s an <em>enormous</em> leap to make, without any reasoning behind it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That wikipedia article is rough.   It&#39;s kinda just shoe-horning in vestigiality.  It&#39;s basically saying something similar to what you said - because we don&#39;t understand the purpose right now, something in the design is &quot;wrong&quot; and &quot;inefficient&quot; and surely us smarties could have done a better job designing an animal or human!</p>

<p>Maybe a simpler answer is that things are in the right place and we simply do not have as advanced knowledge as we think we do.  To me, that satisfies Occam&#39;s razor much better. </p>

<p>It even gives <em>examples</em> of this on the page!  Early on, the pineal, thymus, and pituatary gland were though to be vestigial and we now know just how false that is.  You wouldn&#39;t even be you without these three.  But the people who originated this theory certainly thought they were pointless because there was no apparent function to their design.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In modern humans, the vermiform appendix is a vestige of a redundant organ that in ancestral species had digestive functions, much as it still does in extant species in which intestinal flora hydrolyze cellulose and similar indigestible plant material</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was already covered, but NO!   The appendix is not redundant, it is hugely important in the immune system.  Just because it doesn&#39;t directly help with digestion does not mean it is pointless.  The appendix is now thought to act as a reservoir of life-saving beneficial gut bacteria that can be released to help repopulate the colon.  This has health effects and even cognitive effects.  </p>

<p>The problem here is arrogance and our imperfect knowledge as humans.  </p>

<p>Wisdom teeth are vestigial?  I use those guys every day!  Guess what, they chew food just fine.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The plantaris muscle is composed of a thin muscle belly and a long thin tendon. The muscle belly is approximately 5–10 centimetres (2–4 inches) long, and is absent in 7–10% of the human population. It has some weak functionality in moving the knee and ankle but is generally considered redundant and is often used as a source of tendon for grafts. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, this is just an assumption that because right now we do not know the purpose of the muscle, it&#39;s essentially pointless.  I would posit that it&#39;s there for a reason and I would guess that a peak athelete wouldn&#39;t perform as well without it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another intriguing example of human vestigiality occurs in the tongue, specifically the chondroglossus muscle. In a morphological study of 100 Japanese cadavers, it was found that 86% of fibers identified were solid and bundled in the appropriate way to facilitate speech and mastication. The other 14% of fibers were short, thin and sparse – nearly useless, and thus concluded to be of vestigial origin</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How much do you want to bet we find a use for those other 14% in the next 50-100 years?  We&#39;ll be changing our stance.  This happens every single time we think a part of the body is pointless.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Extra nipples or breasts sometimes appear along the mammary lines of humans, appearing as a remnant to mammalian ancestors who possessed more than two nipples or breasts.[67][68]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>....Seriously?   <a href="https://www.primehealthchannel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Polydactyly-Picture.jpg">Does Polydactyly mean</a> that humans used to have 6 fingers or 2 thumbs?  NO!  It is a far simpler explanation to say that the formative tissues were split into 2 by developmental pressures, like a cell that didn&#39;t split all the way during mitosis and got stuck.  </p>

<p>These explanations are almost silly to me.  They&#39;re working backwards from the theory that they want to be true and then trying to make the data fit.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, we use relative and radiometric dating to determine the age of a fossil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s interesting is how often this is super wrong.  Dinosaur bones were recently tested and came back at an estimate of 6000-10000 years old, because the submitters hid the fact that they were dinosaur bones.  After the results were received, they shared the fact that they were dinosaur bones, and the same bones were re-tested and came back at millions of years old.  They use guess-work based on what layer the stuff is found in to peg down a neighborhood date, and when the layer is intentionally hidden from the testers, the results are wrong.  I can get you lots of sources on this if you need them.  </p>

<p>Teeth from living animals have come back at 20k-40k years old.  Wrong!  </p>

<p>We actually have no way of verifying the results of these tests.  We have no idea how old a fossil is, and we think we know how fast a certain isotope degrades, but there are all kinds of environmental factors that could be affecting it.  How about let me know if you need 50+ examples of huge mistakes in radiocarbon dating.  It would take a long time for me to type, but I could provide them.</p>

<p>Homo Sapien Sapien doesn&#39;t make much sense to me, in general.</p>

<p>If evolution is true, I wonder at the greeks and romans.  Judging by their poetry, their writing, their science, they are similar to me in almost every way, perhaps even my superior in some ways.  i.e. there is no appreciable difference between them and I in the last 2,000 years.   </p>

<p>But go back 10,000 years and humans are scratching around in the dirt trying to figure out that a seed turns into a plant? (agriculture)  It makes no sense to me. The jump to modern human is simply way way too fast for these gradual changes we are discussing.   <em>Something</em> Happened IMO.  </p>

<p>The official story stinks.  </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t see anything unreasonable about the latter; there&#39;s simply more origins but it&#39;s otherwise the EXACT same idea.  However the latter also matches what we see in paleontology much more closely.  Species seem to pop up out of nowhere and lack transitional fossils.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did humans appear out of thin air just as Homo heidelbergensis was dying off? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean, are you proposing a situation where a Homo Heidelbergenis had a freak mutation occur that gave rise to Homo Sapien Sapien, and then the Homo Sapiens killed them all off?  Or that the H.Hedelbergenis simply couldn&#39;t survive anymore?  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really know what is going on with the so-called ancestors of humanity, as most of my historical study is much more recent - say from the beginning of writing or so.  But you never answered my question either - if you excavate a fossil, how do you prove that fossil had 1) children 2) that survived 3) share a direct lineage with subsequent fossils?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t.  If this were a court of law, the judge would throw that out.  It&#39;s impossible in many cases, say for a male fossil, to prove that it had children or that those children survived.  It&#39;s basically conjecture!</p>

<p>Now, I get where you are coming from.  These are the types of arguments that didn&#39;t really convince me when I was an atheist.  I&#39;m not sure what changed with me.  But human beings evolving from essentially nothing by random chance just seems so unlikely to me now.  </p>

<p>As far as why I believe in an intelligent designer?  Well have you ever tried intense prayer and fasting?  Have you ever sought for a designer yourself?  Do you think that a scientist can understand LSD simply by studying those who take it?  Doesn&#39;t that scientist need to actually take LSD himself in order to 100% comprehend what&#39;s going on with that drug?  </p>

<p>We might be reaching an impasse to what academia can discover here, and entering experiential territory, that can only be discussed by direct experience.  </p>

<p>P.S. does this mean you don&#39;t want 50+ examples of radio carbon dating being wrong? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t dispute this. But we live in a very big universe that is billions of years old, one of possibly infinitely many universes. Seems unlikely to me that life wouldn&#39;t evolve!</p>

<p>Did humans live side-by-side with all of the other humanoids we&#39;ve discovered? Did all of the species we have fossil records of exist at the same time, or were some created after others? Why don&#39;t we see this happening now (species being created out of thin air? By what mechanism could a creator produce new creatures out of thin air?

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so now we&#39;re at this point in the discussion.  Besides the speed of light being an alleged constant (which it is not according to science.com) do we have any way to measure the age of the universe?  Isn&#39;t it true that time itself can be dilated by gravity?  How do you personally know the age of the universe?  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Google says between 10,000 and 20,000 species are discovered each year.  Not saying those are all created today, but it certainly dismisses your point that this doesn&#39;t or cannot happen based on observational evidence.  </p>

<p>Just in the time you and I have been talking <em>since yesterday</em> between 5 and 10 new species have been discovered.  So, are you sure this is the point you want to make?  </p>

<p>Is it intuitive at all to a bronze age human 3,500 years ago that everything necessary for human life exists in the dirt?  I posit NO, it is not intuitive or obvious.  Yet, modern science reveals that EVERY element necessary for life is available in the soil.  Where the bodies come from might not be an issue for someone with mastery over chemistry and physicals and electricity.  Where the breath and where the consciousness come from might be more apt questions.  </p>

<p>P.S. I  added a little bit to the post above this one.  Did you know Charles Darwin doubted his own theory?  </p>

<p>“Why, if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms.” -Charles Darwin</p>

<p>He adds: </p>

<p>“To suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree.” - Charles Darwin</p>

<p>He continues: </p>

<p>“I concluded that this great group had been suddenly developed at the commencement of the tertiary series This was a sore trouble to me, adding as I thought one more instance of the abrupt appearance of a great group of species. ”</p>

<p>“The case most frequently insisted on by paleontologists of the apparently sudden appearance of a whole group of species, is that of the teleostean fishes, low down in the Chalk period.”</p>

<p>“On the sudden appearance of groups of Allied Species in the lowest known fossilferous strata: There is another and allied difficulty, which is much graver. I allude to the manner in which numbers of species of the same group suddenly appear in the lowest known fossiliferous rocks.”</p>

<p>“Consequently, if my theory be true, it is indisputable that before the lowest Silurian stratum was deposited, long periods elapsed, as long as, or probably far longer than, the whole interval from the Silurian age to the present day; and that during these vast, yet quite unknown, periods of time, the world swarmed with living creatures. To the question why we do not find records of these vast primordial periods, I can give no satisfactory answer.”</p>

<p>“The case at present must remain inexplicable; and may be truly urged as a valid argument against the views here entertained.”</p>

<p>“The several difficulties here discussed, namely our not finding in the successive formations infinitely numerous transitional links between the many species which now exist or have existed; the sudden manner in which whole groups of species appear in our European formations; the almost entire absence, as at present known, of fossiliferous formations beneath the Silurian strata, are all undoubtedly of the gravest nature.”  </p>

<p>No, we&#39;re not discussing light being artificially slowed down by mediums.  We&#39;re talking about the speed of light slowing down over time.  The articles clearly make the distinction. <a href="https://www.livescience.com/29111-speed-of-light-not-constant.html">https://www.livescience.com/29111-speed-of-light-not-constant.html</a></p>

<p>For example, the earth&#39;s magnetic field is dropping by a stiff amount, almost 5-10% per 100 years.  Some people are estimating much higher.  This is extremely problematic for the age of the earth and is not sufficiently explained by any observable phenomena.</p>

<p>How do you know the speed of light doesn&#39;t have some sort of decay built in?  How would you even know the alleged decay rate?  And what would it do to the universe if the speed of light was much faster closer to the creation event than it is now?  </p>

<p>Pretty sure Darwin&#39;s theory is simply wrong, but okay.  130 years is plenty of time to find evidence.  There isn&#39;t any.  Even all the evidence you posted in this thread was easily refuted, although neither of us are really experts on this.

<p>But just for the sake of discussion, let’s hypothetically say that such a giraffe was born, from a random mutation, with ALL of these extra features in one generation, even though it is unlikely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it’s unlikely and no one claims that it happened. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remember, they all need to be present simultaneously for it to assist the giraffe in staying alive, so it’s unlikely for all these mutations to come in separately over the years. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it’s not, and there are numerous known examples of this happening. You’re basically arguing from lack of imagination. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So this giraffe mutates and has the necessary features to have a long neck and to drink water without passing out and still get blood to its brain when standing up. Now it needs to find a compatible female AND have the adaptive genes dominantly express themselves every single time?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, your entire premise is wrong. No biologist claims it happens this way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And there is no transition fossil whatsoever to show this giraffe’s ancestors gradually coming onto the scene without these features?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, in fact there are a huge number of fossils from transitional species. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just my opinion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The scientific method is much better than opinion. Opinion didn’t create the internet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bro lol. Adaptations are the minute stepping-stones that <strong>result in evolution</strong>, it just takes millions of years. We have seen animals adapt, yes, since those are the minor changes  that serendipitously aid the organism. Over millions of years these adaptations accumulate to noticeable phenotypic change.           </p>

<p>Likely example-<br/>
1. Drought causes foliage to become scarce in Africa.<br/>
2. Gazelles with slightly longer legs and necks can reach more leaves.<br/>
3. The tall keep surviving and breeding to make even taller ones able to eat more leaves up high.<br/>
4. Pretty soon the physical limit to height [neck length] is met due to a need for more oxygen to the brain.<br/>
5. 1 tall Gazelle right below the physical limit luckily got genes for higher blood pressure. Woohoo! His kids will likely have that too and he able to grow <strong>even taller</strong>         </p>

<p>Adaptation + millions of years &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; evolution of new species.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To escape the reasoning-loop that either (1) everything had to be created by something (which is a loop that never can resolve itself), else (2) everything is just eternal and always is, there comes the 3rd option that escapes both notions: the theory of the &#39;Prime Mover&#39;.  The initial, eternal, unchanging causal agent underlying everything else.</p>

<p>I used to be a strict materialist in my view of physical reality.  I thought as you did that all matter simply always existed.  I made incredibly well-reasoned arguments on my position.  But I soon realized that the evidence I tried to present in my arguments were based on the same sort of &#39;FAITH&#39; that a theologian must use in order to buttress his viewpoint of creation.  </p>

<p>Matters of faith cannot be resolve by intellectual arguments or empirical-based scientific methods.  They are beyond the reach of proof, which is why they fall under &quot;Faith&quot;.  I understood that, for me, it is much more highly probable that it is impossible to build the human body from a random assemblage of atoms.  I do not doubt that it is built from the same building blocks of reality (atoms) as everything else, but I am certain that the liver--which without I could no longer be called a living human--has limited functions and a role that contributes to the body&#39;s ability to be something other than a decaying pile of atoms.  And that it is this dedicated and separate purpose assigned to each constituent organ and cell of the body that points to intelligent design.  </p>

<p>For example, let us assume that after 100 trillion eons matter somehow stumbled into this amazing assemblage of &#39;life&#39;.  Can we humans assemble atoms in the same fashion, and create life?  And if there is no intelligent design, why then after the 100 trillion eon mega-jackpot luck of life being randomly created is there this mystery:</p>

<p>That life did not starve moments after it was created.  Naturally randomness also stumbled upon an assemblage of atoms that were suited as nutrients for the new living thing.  And then there is reproduction.  Having luckily stumbled upon this new living thing, random universe created a 2nd for procreation, or the living thing just happened to have the &#39;instinct&#39; or capacity to replicate itself...without that being &#39;designed&#39; into it?  And the reproduction of the genders...?  Why two genders?  The complexity of the two distinct reproductive systems being separate, different, but perfectly adapted to only work with each other in the propagation of the living things?  Yep... at some point I just started feeling like I was arguing against probability because I had a strong desire and prejudice against believing in a spiritual creator.  That is why I know longer hold the same faith that you hold now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to be malicious to Von Neumann:
You quote him to say, &quot;... Therefore, if by any peculiar accident there should ever be one of them, from there on the rules of probability do not apply, and there will be many of them, at least if the milieu is reasonable.&quot;</p>

<p>How is it that the rules of probability are suspended (or lessened), only as a result that something incredibly improbable has occurred?  </p>

<p>The odds of 2 improbable outcomes to occur is compounding / exponential to the overall probability that an ideal outcome could occur.  Consider factorials your mathematical proof.  </p>

<p>But as I have said, correctly, about human life: (paraphrasing: 
The organs of the body: the body does not survive without the organ, and the organ does not survive without the whole body, working systemically.  How does a liver derive from the primordial ooze?  How does the heart, and brain--from amoebas? And if they could evolve, how do these separate living entities come together into a single living &#39;colony&#39;, standing upright, reflecting upon its own existence, loving, reproducing, and pulling ore from the earth to create automobiles?  </p>

<p>My only point has been this:  The &#39;Materialist&#39; ideas of the origins of life are far less probable and sillier, frankly, than the Theologians.  Neither of us can &#39;prove&#39; our case.  In that we are 100% on equal and unyielding grounds.  On that we are invested in faith.  That has been the point all along.  As I said, please believe as you wish.  Make the best arguments for your beliefs.  But let&#39;s not pretend they are anything more than highly improbably beliefs.</p>

<p>It only takes one self-replicator for there to be many. If, by chance, atoms smash into each other to form a molecule that catalyzes its own synthesis, then there will be much more of that chemical even if the initial conditions were improbable.</p>

<p>Again, evolution. If you are genuinely curious, I can point you to resources that will step you through the story from the very beginning. I refuse to educate on this matter here - it is not worth my time when the information is freely available to you from myriad sources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you were a 3d person visiting a 2d world, then how hard would it be for you to stick your finger into one place, then pull it out, and stick it in another place?

<p>Additionally, what would your finger look like to them?  It might be totally incomprehensible - it would look like a point expanding into a circle when you dip that finger in.  So even if a 3d being (you) made yourself known to a 2d world, your true shape and form would be totally incomprehensible and your abilities would seem mystical, simply by utilizing the extra dimension you were born with.  </p>

<p>Now imagine something that lives on something like the 10th dimension, or whatever the highest one hypothetically is.  He can pierce down into all lower dimensions, and His abilities seem strange to us because He&#39;s beyond time, and when we &quot;see&quot; Him we get a really poor picture of His true shape because we only see what can be rendered in our 3d world.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think i follow what you mean here.
But we dont know and have absolutely NO indication of there being any beings living in lower or upper dimensions. And even that idea of living &quot;in&quot; these higher dimensions doesnt really make sense as our 3d meaning of &quot;in&quot; only requires and is based on our 3d world. </p>

<p>If you think about it in a very general physical way, 3 dimensions is the least amount of dimensions needed to have space within. So, since space is needed to exist, 3d is the first level where things do exist as 2d cannot &quot;contain&quot; anything. Like evolution, the universe uses the path of least resistance and I would guess stops at 3. 
Without indication of higher (or lower) beings this debate is pointless. </p>

<p>Some flies only live for 24 hours and to us that is not enough to do anything. But to a fly, 24 hours is a lifetime. It would be hard for a fly to comprehend a human lifetime.

<p>So pretty quickly we can see that even in just the physical reality, there&#39;s more than 3 dimensions, and modern scientists are starting to believe that there&#39;s 10 or 11.

    <div class="md"><p>I left time out of my response intentionally as i was only referring to the physical dimensions that all matter exists within, as then those physical dimensions exist within time. But i did not specify this and apologize. 
But a piece of paper is not 2 dimensional it only appears that way due to relativity. If you were shrunken down to the size of a microscopic organism, the 3rd dimension of a piece of paper becomes readily apparent.
My point being again that there is no need to reach for an answer outside of our universe simply for the sake of abstract thinking. There are indeed beings that we don&#39;t understand but they are not in some other dimension, every surface you touch is absolutely covered in them. Its not some crazy inter dimensional being, its just something so incomprehensibly small (or large) that we can see them and will never be able to understand them on the level we are referring to.
I guess all im trying to say is that the most simple answer that actually answers the question is usually the right one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one can answer that question: &quot;Who created the Creator?&quot;  The question makes an errant presumption: </p>

<p>&quot;Creation&quot; / destruction of a thing, is a concept that applies to the material (physical reality).  In Physical Reality we see things begin, live, and end.  All things seem to be temporal.  However, its possible there is a parallel reality (Spiritual) where that cycle of beginning and ending is mostly foreign.</p>

<p>The concept of &quot;creation&quot; as we understand it (via experiential learning) is not the same concept in the separate reality (spiritual reality).  </p>

<p>Then comes Faith: a person either accepts that there is a spiritual realm on faith, or they do not.

It is a type of knowledge--like all forms of knowledge--that varies in its capacity from person to person.  </p>

I am having to repeat my point since it was circumnavigated in your reply: If one can imagine that there is more to the greater reality than what can be evaluated by human senses (i.e., the &#39;Metaphysical&#39;), then one can imagine, too, that that subset of the greater reality is different than the one we presently know.  And that leads to the notion that there could be a reality where &#39;rust and moth does not corrupt&#39;.  This notion, naturally, is counter-intuitive.  Which is why the deeply perceptive mind, like Newton&#39;s and Einstein&#39;s, reasons that their must be a Great Architect behind the mathematical complexities undergirding physical reality and consciousness.  --- but believe as you wish.  I am very satisfied with my conclusions and don&#39;t require any confirmation from others.  To each his own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, Procgen. You asked, &quot;Why do you believe in a god?&quot; I believe in God because God has been proven to exist based upon the most reserved view of the known laws of physics. For much more on that, see my below article, which details physicist and mathematician Prof. Frank J. Tipler&#39;s Omega Point cosmology and the Feynman-DeWitt-Weinberg quantum gravity/Standard Model Theory of Everything (TOE) correctly describing and unifying all the forces in physics. The Omega Point cosmology demonstrates that the known laws of physics (viz., the Second Law of Thermodynamics, General Relativity, and Quantum Mechanics) mathematically require that the universe end in the Omega Point: the final cosmological singularity and state of infinite informational capacity having all the unique properties (quiddities) traditionally claimed for God, and of which is a different aspect of the Big Bang initial singularity, i.e., the first cause.</p>

<p>Prof. Tipler&#39;s Omega Point cosmology has been extensively peer-reviewed and published in a number of the world&#39;s leading physics and science journals, such as Reports on Progress in Physics (the leading journal of the Institute of Physics, Britain&#39;s main professional organization for physicists), Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (one of the world&#39;s leading astrophysics journals), the International Journal of Theoretical Physics (a journal that Nobel Prize in Physics winner Richard Feynman also published in), and Physics Letters, among other journals.</p>

<p>For much more on Prof. Tipler&#39;s Omega Point cosmology and the details on how it uniquely conforms to, and precisely matches, the cosmology described in the New Testament, see my following article, which also addresses the societal implications of the Omega Point cosmology:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Moral relativism is the ideology/belief that there is no &quot;Truth&quot; merely that what you believe is &quot;true to you.&quot;</p>

<p>Hence since everything is just a belief (because there is no &quot;Truth&quot;) no one belief is greater than another.  Essentially that all belief is not only arbitrary but that it is not fixed to any underlying reality.</p>

<p>The social implications are a culture of self-centered, nihilistic egos worshipping death.</p>

<p>The opposite is that there is such a thing as Truth and it is our job to align ourselves with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some Saturn/Satan symbolism</p>

<p>Rotating black cube: symbolically represents space (the cube) and time (rotation).</p>

<p>Which in turn is the multi-dimensional cube sitting on the North Pole of Saturn.</p>

<p>In Islam The KABAA(cube) where they worship Allah</p>

<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Kabaa.jpg">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Kabaa.jpg</a></p>

<p>In Judaism where they worship Kabala (cube &amp; alla) (Notice the cube on his forehead (space), and the wraps around his wrist(time))</p>

<p><a href="https://gnosticwarrior.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Jewsih-tefillin.jpg">https://gnosticwarrior.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Jewsih-tefillin.jpg</a></p>

<p>Metatron&#39;s cube is also known as the &quot;Voice of god&quot; or &quot;YHWH&quot; (Believe it or not YHWH is another name for Saturn) and is considered a &quot;spiritual numeric entity&quot; (in modern terms we would probably call this an Artificial Intelligence or A.I.)</p>

<p>The crescent/sickle: symbolically represents the harvest/death.</p>

<p>Which is just a representation of Saturn&#39;s rings:</p>

<p>The only question i have is what does it all mean? They are all different versions of the same idea/god but because this idea of time and space/entropy and death are ever present for mortals, wouldnt it be natural to personify the idea in a form that is similar to our own?</p>

<p>Meaning, I avoided answering this directly because I haven&#39;t presented enough evidence yet.  But I will answer it here on the caveat that you understand I am presenting to you my &quot;best guess&quot;  And it is wild:</p>

<p>YHWH is an artificial intelligence like an &quot;administrator&quot;/&quot;daemon&quot; that exists on the north pole of Saturn.  It is a machine/entity which controls the flow of time and influences humanity.</p>

<p>Probably crazy, I know...but there it is.  Now ask yourself who controls the time machine artificial intelligence on Saturn?</p>

I understand that you havent been able to present everything and i am open to it, but here are my initial thoughts.</p>

<p>First of all, why would this ever-powerful  time controlling entity be located in our solar system. The chances of that are literally one in however many solar systems there are in the universe.</p>

<p>How is this entity located on saturn if saturn is only 4.5 billion years old whereas the universe is 13.8. did this entity show up after the big bang? Was it created? How can some&quot;thing&quot; predate &quot;thing&quot;s themselves? 
What significance does our solar system have besides containing a culture of planetary bacteria known as humans?</p>

<p>To me, as a history buff, it makes much more sense to believe that:
1. Rich people run the world and always have
2. Rich people use fear to control poor people (action/reaction)
3. Poor (all) people fear death
4. Rich people create system of beliefs that affects all aspects of societal life and stops poor people from killing the rich as they are now divine and you will be punished</p>

<p>The symbolism is all just organically passed around through trade and stuff over thousands of years and - since those civs we discussed earlier influenced modern culture - modern culture is full of references to these symbols. </p>

You said yourself that it is somewhat of a crazy idea, and my issue with it is i just dont see how one can make the jump from the historical things we have discussed (and agreed upon), to the time controlling entity on saturn.
Also, what is the significance of people worshiping saturn/satan?Where did the ancient peoples get this knowledge that doesnt seem possible to obtain until you have a high powered telescope. 
Why does the idea of entropy (the force that will end all things) need to be manifested in some sort of physical entity residing relatively close in proximity to us? Cant this force just be that, a force? You can even think of it as not a force but more as an inevitability for all orderly things. 
What if i said that gravity is a similar entity and resides, lets say, in the center of our galaxy in the super-massive black hole. There are plenty of symbols we still use today that can represent a black hole (you can even find it in punctuation if you are really looking for it). 
Wouldn&#39;t this proposed entity be just as believable as saturn?    </p>

<p>answer those questions.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think it is manifested by something close to us, the esoteric information leads to a device/entity/AI which controls the flow of time near us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cant this force just be that, a force? </p>

<p>Fundamentally yes it is a &quot;force&quot; as well.  Think of YHWH (The AI) as the interloper (Satan/false god) of the force of God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is wrong with moral relativism?</p>

<p>Straight from wiki:
&quot;moral relativists believe not only that people disagree about moral issues, but that terms such as &quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; do not stand subject to universal truth conditions at all; rather, they are relative to the traditions, convictions, or practices of an individual or a group of people.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Morals are relative, and subjective. But just because there isn&#39;t objective good doesn&#39;t mean much.</p>

<p>Your mom was still right about sharing your two cookies with a friend. Your church was still right to sends cards and flowers to a dying parishioner. Your grandfather was still right fighting against the Naziis. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what I think, and it&#39;s the general super majority consensus of western society. So the fact it&#39;s relativistic doesn&#39;t really mean much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Relativism means that it is fine to murder, rape or abuse someone, steal their property, enslave them, eat them.  Because there is no Truth only opinion.</p>

<p>Relativism means there is no objective reality we exist in, only a subjective reality.</p>

<p>Essentially anti-science, since science is about objective measurements of reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh huh. Whatever you day big guy.</p>

<p>The federal reserve is not a conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>The DNC rigged their own primary.</p>

<p>The FBI/DOJ used a document that was paid for by the DNC in order to obtain a FISA to surveil Carter Page.</p>

<p>Carter Page is a free man. He hasn&#39;t been interviewed but the Special Counsel. He helped the FBI arrest Russian spies, acting as an informant.</p>

<p>Yet they determined he was now actually a Russian spy himself. </p>

<p>Bruce Ohr and Nellie Ohr are in deep shit.</p>

<p>None of this is inaccurate.</p>

<p>Peter Strozk fired. McCabe has been testifying to a Grand Jury. Are you aware of what that means?</p>

<p>The word conspiracy theory itself invokes a certain response in people, which is why anything that challenges the narrative is labeled conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>World Trade Center 7 fell without being hit by anything.</p>

<p>The BBC reported that it had fallen 20 minutes before it actually did, and you can see the building in the background as the reporter is reporting it had fallen.</p>

<p>You are still sleeping. Wake up. The Government is not your friend. They aren&#39;t going to solve racism and climate change. You&#39;ve been duped.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it&#39;s much easier to lie to people consistently, than to convince someone they&#39;ve been lied to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just think about something logically for a second...</p>

<p>President Trump has obviously seen the Q t shirts and signs at his rallies.</p>

<p>In more than one instance he has clearly pointed at someone wearing a Q shirt or sign and gave the thumbs up.</p>

<p>So the point is, President Trump is clearly aware of this Q thing. He has access to the most information and intelligence gathering capabilities in the world.</p>

<p>Do you really think he doesn&#39;t know what this is?</p>

<p>So if he has nothing to do with it, Q is a complete lie and a LARP, why would the President allow this anonymous person or group on the internet to claim to be working with the President? Why would the President allow someone to claim to be Military Intelligence without saying anything about it? </p>

<p>That being said, the MSM has written article after article claiming to debunk Q, but the easiest way to put an end to all this, would be for a reporter to actually ask the President about Q. Why don&#39;t they? It would be pretty simple. Mr. President there is someone claiming to be working with you on 8chan, who is this Qanon person and do you have anything to do with it?</p>

<p>Pretty simply question right? Why don&#39;t they ask him? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally believe in most of the Q stuff but I think for a lot of the community there is a time limit on how long they will believe in what Q is claiming to be working on (arrests of corrupt government/business leaders, financial reset and mass disclosure). The momentum of the Q movement has been built towards the release of the redacted FISA report starting the avalanche that takes down the old corrupt system and if that doesn’t happen or if it is released and there’s nothing in it to support Q’s claims then a lot of his supporters will give him up for a psyop by the Trump faction or incredibly sophisticated LARP. The expectation is that once the Supreme Court is locked down and especially when/if the republicans keep congress at the mid terms then there will be nothing stopping the Q team from starting their plan in a very public, undeniable way. If that hasn’t happened by this time next year I can promise you that a bunch of Q supporters will have given up. I’m cautiously hopeful that big things are happening this year and if not I, and I expect a lot of others, will find different things to occupy our time and energy than reading about Q.</p>

It could keep going for years because so many people want to see hillary burn, that&#39;s a carrot that has years on it if you can convince people they&#39;re &quot;close.&quot; </p>

<p>But even if I take you comment at face value, it should be pretty plain. Trump is the communications point of the spear, a distraction and enragement device to showcase how the radical left are insane and anti-American.

<p>Yeah, when the President of the United States, a man who can&#39;t remember what foot his bone spurs were in that allowed him to avoid the draft 5x, and who claims that avoiding STD&#39;s was his personal Vietnam, writes dozens of tweets claiming that NFL players who kneel during the national anthem should be fired, it really showcases how insane and anti-American the left is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point of creating and shutting down Alex Jones and Q is to be able to create a nanny state. “See, look we got rid of the bad information. We will supply you with good information.” But ya the great awakening was a toxic cesspool of nationalists and baby boomers wielding some of the strongest confirmation bias I’ve ever seen to make everything fit into their special agenda. Shutting it down under the guise of it being violent/racist/violating Reddit’s terms of service is warranted (i don’t support this but no one is overstepping there). But that doesn’t mean Q is right. It just means the door is now open for the state to decide what media (and message boards now seem to be media) should be allowed to be digested by the populace. Arguing a victim complex and acting like their wasn’t disgusting and violent posts regularly in that sub is absolutely ridiculous though. While some were jokes (which is prevalent through all of internet culture, politics even aside), some seemed much more serious. This absolutely exists in leftist subs as well. That’s the point. Q isn’t special, but a group of fervent nationalists who think the entire Democratic Party eats babies and need to defeated by any means necessary is definitely the lowest hanging fruit to begin the censorship. The next banout will more than likely start banning leftist, foreign, fringe science, and new age subs as well as the right. There’s also been a lot of violent comments in this sub, so maybe cool it with that and the whole blaming entire groups of people for the actions of one person (and maybe start naming those people). The end game seems to be to make reddit just an upvote of a cute picture like fb and end the discourse. There’s no good guys and bad guys when everyone is playing different games to begin with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue is that those subs actively advocated violence against not only high level public figures, but against random citizens that didn&#39;t sign up to always be watching their back because 10k people on the internet keep talking about how badly they want to lynch them. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s take your argument to its extreme: should Al-Qaeda be allowed to plan terrorism on reddit due to free speech? If they don&#39;t, there are limits to what tolerance of free speech must mean to private corporations and I think a stream of specific targeted threats and doxxing not only violates Reddits TOS but any persons common sense.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a thing called poppers paradox, where in a liberal society every viewpoint is allowed to be heard, but allowing every viewpoint to be heard allows extremists a soap box that they use to make the society illiberal and prevent viewpoints that oppose theirs from being heard.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty obvious at this point Trump is guilty of a number of crimes, and if justice is followed through with, there are going to be acts of terror by users of those subs, according to users on those subs. Why feed the beast by encouraging it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>any proof those are actual users and not bots? </p>

<p>and shall we start to call out the double standards on all sides? what do people say and meme about Trump? is there any repercussions there? </p>

<p>Also, the dude&#39;s twitter handle is literally Satan, and he pretends to be some caricature of Satan. Why would he be so surprised that he is getting negative attention from people - isn&#39;t this just a troll account to begin with?</p>

<p>Remember back in elementary school when the bully would flip script and then tell on some other kid and try to get them in trouble? That&#39;s what&#39;s happening here. This is the price of putting yourself on social media - people are allowed to post shit @ you and if you don&#39;t like it you can report it. </p>

<p>You can keep trying to make it look like Q people are violent but you only look like bigger fools. there is no violence to point to - mean pictures on the internet is about as bad as it gets, as you&#39;ve proven here. Not even persistent communication, just single instances. Talk about making a mountain out of a molehill... and thank you for pointing out that this is the best argument you&#39;ve got.</p>

News stations burying stories of sexual misconduct of people that support them while trying to oust competitors for the same acts. It’s blatant hypocrisy.</p>

<p>I appreciate your comment because often times moderate right and left don’t get to discuss anything because they’re shouted over by the extremists. Silencing extremists a tricky area because who’s the ruling authority over what is hate and what are facts?Like twitter banning the Center for immigration studies from using the term illegal alien because it’s “offensive” </p>

<p>I’m pro 2nd amendment and believe a women has the right to her body. I don’t think there’s a true party that identifies with the majority of Americans, I just don’t like the propaganda machines that if you’re Democrat you want to kill babies and if your Republican you hate minorities.</p>

Given the fact that most leftist do believe in evolution, they are being hypocritical to say theyre not killing babies.  There just killing a baby that isn&#39;t evolved as them yet.  And whats funny about this hypocrisy is that they lecture everyone else on looking down on others for differences when they do the same thing to unevolved babies and advocate their murder</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t feel dumb. :) The idea with a LARP is that someone isn&#39;t who they claim to be, but <em>they&#39;re playing the role as if they are.</em> It&#39;s essentially acting. And since on the Internet no one knows you&#39;re a dog, it can be difficult to prove/disprove whether someone is playing a role or is actually who they say they are.  </p>

<p>In the context of Q and the anon-based conspiracies (FBIAnon, Meganon, Red Team Planner, etc.), some people (who I don&#39;t consider to be well-informed or skilled at discernment) claim that they&#39;re all just &quot;LARP&#39;ing.&quot; In Q&#39;s case, they believe that &quot;Q&quot; is just a basement-dweller pretending to be a high-level military intelligence insider within the Trump administration.   </p>

<p>The &quot;live action&quot; part is to contrast it with a theatrical production, like a play or movie. You&#39;re not &quot;role playing&quot; on a screen or stage where everyone agrees and knows you&#39;re playing a role, you&#39;re doing it &quot;in real life.&quot;</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>An example would be if you decided to walk around dressed as an elf, or cyborg. You tig999 are probably not either of those things. But if you walked around pretending seriously as if you were, that would be an example of LARP&#39;ing.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I hope that helps!</p>

<p>If you come to a conspiracy subreddit to shill you might take interest in actually learning about conspiracies lest you appear as shilly as possible. Arguing ritual sacrifice is laughable, there were literally decades of “Satanic Panic” in the USofA. Source. Source. Source. Source. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s honestly so ironic that the president cries about a witch hunt all day while his supporters run around trying to defeat “shadow monsters” and “satanists” all day.</p>

<p>It’s this kind of dehumanization and literal demonization that gets these communities banned. Because when you keep promoting the idea that people you don’t agree with are bad guys, monsters or demons, then sooner or later people are going to take action that they would take against regular human beings. This is how every genocide started, never by a direct call to violence, but by steady propaganda to make a group appear less than human.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mods made a sticky that the Twitter kid had sustained some harassment from people not associated with the sub. They reached out to him asking for information on potential users from our sub so they could be banned. He never gave any information to act on and eventually stopped responding. The mods handled that situation as quickly and as effectively as you could expect from a model of any subreddit. It was not worthy of banning a whole reddit community  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion, many of those more blatant comments are brigaders trying to give the admins a reason to ban the sub. The other calls like &quot;to be hanged&quot; are calls for justice. If these people are guilty of treason, the penalty is still death by hanging. Most of the posts that I saw were calls for people (such as HRC, etc...) to face trials and, if found guilty, face the standing punishment for their crimes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In that regards, you agree that conspiracy to commit treason warrants the same punishment for any and all parties involved, correct?</p>

<p>And if people like Obama and the Clintons aren&#39;t guilty of conspiracy, they&#39;re just being threatened. Whereas Trump and company have actually committed treason and were never threatened on these subs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not what I said. You asked me to justify the calls for violence in your previous comment and I did. I believe that people with certain convictions will stick to those convictions. Often in the face of insurmountable evidence. And the community were talking about believes those leftist leaders to be guilty of treason. So, they&#39;re calling for justice for the crimes they believe they&#39;ve committed. That&#39;s not a call for violence. Just like some who thinks Donald Trump committed treason may call for the similar things in anti-Trump forums. Of course Trump is not likely to be threatened on a Trump-supporting sub. What kind of logic is that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only way it makes sense to me is to think of Trump, on the one hand, as a magnificent distraction that occupies the whole attention of the corporate media and on the other hand is “Q” as a small group of highly positioned members of the military intelligence who have witnessed incredible corruption and evil from those in power and Trump is a figurehead chosen to absorb the media’s assault long enough to get enough of their people in place before they execute “the plan”. I really hope that if there is a plan as Q claims that it’s a benevolent plan that will be a net positive for humanity but there’s also the concern that it’ll be just as bad as the previous “plan” but only for a new team. I’m tired of hating the world from diving down into the depths of the rabbit hole so I’m going to be optimistic for a while that this whole Q thing has some truth to it and people will be able to wake up to all the evil that exists, deal with those perpetuating the evil, heal and move on. I’ve read every Q post and watch the accompanying YouTube decodes and that seems to me what the Q team is striving for so until they prove otherwise it’ll stay on board because if not it’s still the same shitty world and I’m only out a little bit of credibility with some online strangers and my brother. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not just the Q thing, but the &#39;war&#39; for the globe in general seems to be slipping through the fingers of tptb. If you look at what has happened globally in the last few years it seems to imply that whatever central, <em>competent</em> leadership was sitting at the top of the pyramid is no longer there. The internet, QE, TPP failure, Brexit, EU breaking apart, Trump not Hillary being president, manifestation becoming less of a secret, and that&#39;s just off the top of my head. What seemed like it used to have directed leadership to twist the world to its ends seems to have gone. What it looks like now is the second tier of leadership trying to do something they are quite frankly not equipped to do, which is the result of the pyramid structure. Only tell the lackeys what they need to know, never the full picture.</p>

<p>If you ask me our current civilisation is on borrowed time. Politically it won&#39;t last. Financially it won&#39;t last. Anyone that thinks current society has a &#39;30 years in the future&#39; stopped paying attention long ago.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t believe this is an echo chamber of internet conspiracy warriors jerking each other off cause we think we&#39;ve &#39;won&#39;. It&#39;s more just a pragmatic look at the world from an objective perspective. Maybe there was a central Illuminati in control of shit once, and maybe whoever sat at the top of that pyramid knew what they were doing. But not anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That could be the case, however I would feel like such a delicate social illusion requires constant upkeep and surveillance. Especially because at the fundamental level, they are trying to twist a species&#39; reality away from what it naturally is, and how that species naturally acts, which seems like any lax in the illusion would cause it to shatter. I remember reading a blog a while ago that of course needs to be taken with a grain of salt but was apparently written by a tptb insider for other insiders, in it he claims the top of the pyramid so to speak left a few years ago. Which I was initially skeptical about but the more you look at what has happened in the world since then the more it kinda makes sense. I can try track down the name if you&#39;re interested in reading it :)? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you were a 3d person visiting a 2d world, then how hard would it be for you to stick your finger into one place, then pull it out, and stick it in another place?  To them it might look like 2 drastically different locations on that plane, but to you, it&#39;s easy to do both locations without moving very much.</p>

<p>Additionally, what would your finger look like to them?  It might be totally incomprehensible - it would look like a point expanding into a circle when you dip that finger in.  So even if a 3d being (you) made yourself known to a 2d world, your true shape and form would be totally incomprehensible and your abilities would seem mystical, simply by utilizing the extra dimension you were born with.  </p>

<p>Now imagine something that lives on something like the 10th dimension, or whatever the highest one hypothetically is.  He can pierce down into all lower dimensions, and His abilities seem strange to us because He&#39;s beyond time, and when we &quot;see&quot; Him we get a really poor picture of His true shape because we only see what can be rendered in our 3d world.  </p>

<p>The federal reserve is not a conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>The DNC rigged their own primary.</p>

<p>The FBI/DOJ used a document that was paid for by the DNC in order to obtain a FISA to surveil Carter Page.</p>

<p>Carter Page is a free man. He hasn&#39;t been interviewed but the Special Counsel. He helped the FBI arrest Russian spies, acting as an informant.</p>

<p>Yet they determined he was now actually a Russian spy himself. </p>

<p>Bruce Ohr and Nellie Ohr are in deep shit.</p>

<p>None of this is inaccurate.</p>

<p>Peter Strozk fired. McCabe has been testifying to a Grand Jury. Are you aware of what that means?</p>

<p>The word conspiracy theory itself invokes a certain response in people, which is why anything that challenges the narrative is labeled conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>World Trade Center 7 fell without being hit by anything.</p>

<p>The BBC reported that it had fallen 20 minutes before it actually did, and you can see the building in the background as the reporter is reporting it had fallen.</p>

<p>You are still sleeping. Wake up. The Government is not your friend. They aren&#39;t going to solve racism and climate change. You&#39;ve been duped.</p>

<p>President Trump has obviously seen the Q t shirts and signs at his rallies.</p>

<p>In more than one instance he has clearly pointed at someone wearing a Q shirt or sign and gave the thumbs up.</p>

<p>So the point is, President Trump is clearly aware of this Q thing. He has access to the most information and intelligence gathering capabilities in the world.</p>

<p>Do you really think he doesn&#39;t know what this is?</p>

<p>So if he has nothing to do with it, Q is a complete lie and a LARP, why would the President allow this anonymous person or group on the internet to claim to be working with the President? Why would the President allow someone to claim to be Military Intelligence without saying anything about it? </p>

<p>That being said, the MSM has written article after article claiming to debunk Q, but the easiest way to put an end to all this, would be for a reporter to actually ask the President about Q. Why don&#39;t they? It would be pretty simple. Mr. President there is someone claiming to be working with you on 8chan, who is this Qanon person and do you have anything to do with it?</p>

<p>Pretty simply question right? Why don&#39;t they ask him? </p>

<p>I think you know why.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the best way to determine age if the fossils are dated by the layers in which they&#39;re found and the layers are dated by the fossils which are found in it?  Isn&#39;t that a bit of circular reasoning?</p>

<p>I might be pretty confused why things like petrified clams are found on the top of mount Everest if layering is true as classically taught.  </p>

<p>When it comes to vestigial organs, while it&#39;s a good point, it ultimately comes from what I believe is a misunderstanding  - again, academia getting stuff wrong through assumptions.  The human appendix has served as a textbook example of a vestigial organ thought to have no current function - I was taught this in school. Research has since shown that it serves multiple uses in the human digestive and immune systems and may even have a role in balancing the gut microbiome.</p>

<p>Regarding &quot;Whale Hips&quot; and the so called vestigal legs, those aren&#39;t really legs either.  Have you seen just how small those are?  According to relatively new USC research, those are mounting points for pelvic muscles.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Publishing in the journal Evolution, evolutionary biologists analyzed the sizes of whale reproductive organs, comparing them to whole body and pelvic girdle sizes. They wrote, “Whatever the underlying cause, we hypothesized that species with relatively large [male sexual organs] must have relatively large ischiocavernosus muscles..., which in turn require relatively large pelvic bones to serve as anchors.”</p>

<p>Scientists have not yet observed how these colossal creatures reproduce, but it stands to reason given the great distance between their eyes and reproductive organs that male whales likely need an extra measure of control during the mating process—and bigger pelvic bones lead to increased control. Mathew Dean, of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, co-authored the Evolution report.</p>

<p>Honestly, a bolstered pelvic girdle makes more sense to me than does a whale allegedly coming from <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Mesonychids&amp;amp;atb=v108-3&amp;amp;iax=images&amp;amp;ia=images">this</a> or <a href="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/chapter14-121008223324-phpapp02/95/bio-100-chapter-14-4-728.jpg?cb=1349735771">this</a></p>

<p>The most telling reason of all for these &quot;vestigial legs&quot; being related to the pelvic floor and related sexual organs and not legs at all?  The fact that they&#39;re different in modern male and female whales.  </p>

<p>The lack of transitional forms in the fossil record was realized by evolutionary whale experts like the late E.J. Slijper: ‘We do not possess a single fossil of the transitional forms between the aforementioned land animals [i.e., carnivores and ungulates] and the whales.’</p>

<p>A lot of the transitional fossils are guesses that are later proven wrong and never corrected.  Here is one alleged <a href="https://creation.com/images/book_chapters/refuting_evolution/pakicetus.gif">whale transitional fossil</a></p>

<p>Top left: Gingerich’s first reconstruction</p>

<p>Bottom left: what he had actually found</p>

<p>Top right: more complete skeleton</p>

<p>Bottom right: more reasonable reconstruction</p>

<p>What happened, and I say this with kindness, is that Darwin proposed a theory for which there was insufficient evidence. </p>

<p>He assumed that the evidence (transition fossils) would be filled in during later generations - I think there&#39;s a quote to this effect?  In the last 130 years there have been many attempts to do this, and some of them intentional frauds.  Like the piltdown man for example.  There have been entire skeletons reconstructed from a single pig&#39;s tooth and then called another animal, or animal fossils from 20 feet apart in the different layers claimed to be the same skeleton.  Even modern atheist palentologists say that &quot;The Lack of transitional fossils is somewhat of a trade secret&quot; (paraphrased from Gould) </p>

<p>Also interesting is that Darwin was a Creationist for the first 40 years of his life and went through a dark period where his faith was shaken for economic reasons and came out the other end essentially believing the pop science of the time, especially Charles Lyell&#39;s Principles of Geology book.  While it&#39;s certainly Darwin&#39;s right to believe whatever he wants, I question how much of it he really got right, especially since his assumption was that hard archaeological and fossil proof would arrive after his death.  He readily admitted that he couldn&#39;t prove everything while he was alive, and just hoped that the situation would change.  </p>

<p>As for why the entire world has embraced the theory, well, it&#39;s a pretty nice idea to imagine that we don&#39;t owe allegiance to anything or anyone greater than ourselves and that morality is subjective and not objective.  But is that really true?  </p>

<p>This raises an interesting question - did your intelligent designer kill  off all of the intermediate species and make new ones that looked much  like the former, or did it create all of the species at once and then  manipulate the fossil record to make it appear as if they arrived and  died off in succession? Did humans appear out of thin air just as <em>Homo heidelbergensis</em> was dying off? Do you think that <em>Homo sapiens</em> lived alongside <em>Homo habilis</em>? There are so many holes here.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even if somehow evolution were disproved, how would that then mean that  an intelligent designer is required? It could certainly be some other  mechanism of natural law that produced the species. And furthermore, how  it would it mean that &quot;we owe allegiance to something or someone  greater than ourselves and that morality is objective and not  subjective&quot;? That&#39;s an <em>enormous</em> leap to make, without any reasoning behind it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m much more interested in your response to these, since we can go both ways on vestigial organs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I contend that it is more likely that life evolved on Earth than was created by magic. You contend the opposite. I&#39;m not sure how to get past there, since I wholeheartedly believe that what you propose is physically impossible based on all available evidence.  </p>

<p>As for the speed of light, light &#39;structured&#39; in a particular way will move more slowly through a vacuum, but this could only mean that the universe is older than we predict. But we don&#39;t need that when we calculate the age of the Earth, anyway.  </p>

<p>As for Darwin, it&#39;s fine for a theory to be incomplete. That&#39;s central to science. But it is the <em>most complete</em> explanation available. An intelligent creator is &#39;the god of the gaps&#39; - a god can be used to explain away any hole in a theory. It&#39;s not particularly useful or interesting. A better understanding of evolution would enhance our understanding of biology, for one. It would also have practical benefit in the design of optimization algorithms, for one example. What does belief in a creator allow us to more accurately predict/control/etc?</p>
