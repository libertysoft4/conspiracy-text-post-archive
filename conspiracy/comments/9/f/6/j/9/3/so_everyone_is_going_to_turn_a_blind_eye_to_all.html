    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s when the shills decide to bring accounts to the sub and overwhelm the mods ability to deal with it, then report to admins/ahs and get warnings. They continue this until the sub is banned. Many post slightly extreme versions of normal conversation or push the envelope to egg users on into ban/warning strikes territory.  In the end, reddit requires them to be thought police and filter specific words and phrases and the first mess up the sub is banned.  </p>

<p>Those subs would likely not be affected until the more free speech/non-conforming subs are dealt with.  The banning of those subs will lead to migration to subs like those in the long run and give them more incentive to close them or the &#39;wrong thinkers&#39; will go to pol or 8ch or voat, leaving reddit to its echo chamber and narrative control. The biggest fear is a sub getting too big to ban, like T_D.  They can say these are racist Nazi subs they banned now with little backlash. If it was 100k+ community, there will be a noticeable impact and reaction. MDE grew from 20k to 40k in months. It would be 100k+ in half a year or so and that&#39;s with algorithms keeping it off front page.  They tried to cripple T-D&#39;s growth, too, and it was too late by the time they enacted it. Now its used on all fringe right leaning subs.   </p>

<p>To answer ryour question, unless those 3 subs post highly controversial (by todays standard - race realism, allow slurs, etc) posts, they will be the last to go and probably bastions for exodus from the final banned subs.  Only then will you find shills and ahs brigading and subverting the sub to the point of admin action.</p>

<p>they are the opposition. You have to recognize that both parties aren&#39;t the same. One side literally wants to murder the other. And it&#39;s documented</p>

<p>They see Republicans is the opposition. Republicans would be stupid not to see them as the opposition</p>

<p>we can&#39;t and probably won&#39;t have unity in the country. Not as long as both sides are warring against each other. Not so long as the media constantly manipulates the left into rioting. No. As long as you support freedom of the press which supposedly means the media can lie. Then we&#39;re not going to have Unity. Since we need to stop pretending that it&#39;s actually possible.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I do want that. Do you have a problem with that then you don&#39;t support freedom. Freedom is not the right to be oppressed by corporations. That&#39;s called fascism and that&#39;s what Libertarians  support</p>

<p>See freedom is the right to not have your speech censored on 90% of the world&#39;s Communications.</p>

<p>and if you don&#39;t support the government protecting your freedom like that then I don&#39;t know what you do support. Side note it&#39;s ironic that the same people who hate the idea of the government protecting their freedoms against an elected corporations love the idea of those corporations of pressing them and of the government passing totalitarian laws that allow  warrantless spying</p>

<p>I&#39;m not surprised to see a libertarian fever Corporation suppressing them over the government protecting them from oppression</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not surprised. The topic needs time to mellow out. The transgender community is very touchy as certain political affilitations are actively attempting to demonize and discredit their condition- just like happened with homosexuality.

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like trans people who are trying to demonize anyone who doesn&#39;t want to go along with their redefinition of what it means to be a man or a woman. </p>

<p>Plus, a lot of trans activist are off their rockers. They are mentally ill extremist that make the whole group look batty. Take for example the group at Goldsmiths University who has called for sending TERFs to the Gulag, then claimed the Gulag was a positive place of fun, rehabilitation and relaxing activities. Or consider the serial rapist who claims he is trans so they sent him to a woman&#39;s prison where he raped several women there. </p>

<p>Gender dysphoria — the feeling that the body one is born into doesn&#39;t conform to one&#39;s sense of gender identity — may dissipate as kids get older. A 2011 study is often cited as an argument against medical and social transitioning. It found that 84 percent of kids with gender dysphoria eventually desisted, or came to feel comfortable with their birth-assigned gender. But the study has been widely criticized for its lack of follow-up and other problems.</p>

<p><a href="https://californiahealthline.org/morning-breakout/research-on-children-growing-out-of-gender-dysphoria-adds-layer-of-complexity-to-transgender-care/">https://californiahealthline.org/morning-breakout/research-on-children-growing-out-of-gender-dysphoria-adds-layer-of-complexity-to-transgender-care/</a></p>

<p>The phenomenon of transgender children &quot;growing out of&quot; their transgender identity by the time they are adolescents or adults is called “desistance” by gender researchers. For decades, follow-up studies of transgender kids have shown that a substantial majority -- anywhere from 65 to 94 percent -- eventually ceased to identify as transgender. (Brooks, 5/23)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2697020/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2697020/</a></p>

<p>Multiple longitudinal studies provide evidence that gender-atypical behavior in childhood often leads to a homosexual orientation in adulthood, but only in 2.5% to 20% of cases to a persistent gender identity disorder (3, 6, 22). Even among children who manifest a major degree of discomfort with their own sex, including an aversion to their own genitalia (GID in the strict sense), only a minority go on to an irreversible development of transsexualism</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25231780">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25231780</a></p>

<p>On the subject of treating children, however, as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health notes in their latest Standards of Care, gender dysphoria in childhood does not inevitably continue into adulthood, and only 6 to 23 percent of boys and 12 to 27 percent of girls treated in gender clinics showed persistence of their gender dysphoria into adulthood. Further, most of the boys&#39; gender dysphoria desisted, and in adulthood, they identified as gay rather than as transgender.</p>

<p>~80% of children who meet the criteria for GDC, the GD recedes with puberty. Instead, many of these adolescents will identify as non-heterosexual.17,29 Steensma et al26 interviewed adolescents with different outcomes of GDC (persistence or desistance). The adolescents mentioned social environment, the anticipated results of bodily changes and first romantic and/or sexual experiences as central factors in the desistance or persistence of GD.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>r/Conservative is literally a conservative only subreddit. What would make you think they will allow anything else? They say it right in their sidebar. Same thing goes for T_D. They are an openly admitted pro trump rally subreddit who even says, in their sidebar, anyone whos not pro trump will be banned. Same thing goes for republican. They are all specific subreddits catering to a specific crowd. What on earth would make you think going into any of these and disagreeing with them would result in anyting other then a ban?</p>

<p>these aren&#39;t general subreddits like /WorldNews, /news and politics. your examples are not sufficient </p>

<p>Ok, so I&#39;m of the belief that people could get their idea across <em>a lot</em> more effectively without using baiting terms like &quot;shitlib&quot; (the word just makes me roll my eyes)..</p>

<p>I just want to know why do people keep making this comparision.

<p>Why should comcast let that content through their pipes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Comcast thinks it is in their best interest to block a certain type of content then they are more than free to do so just like when they blocked traffic to bit torrent sites in the past. Once something like that happens it is up to Comcast&#39;s customers to contact the company to voice their displeasure and close their accounts and force Comcast to reverse their decision because blocking a certain type of traffic will hurt Comcast&#39;s bottom line.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AT&amp;T is a private company, why can&#39;t they choose what content to block?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They can, they&#39;ll just piss off their customers so they better have a good excuse for choosing which content to block. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those fiber lines cross through government property, why can&#39;t they choose what goes through it? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read up on the NSA&#39;s Prism program, the government dictates to communication companies what they want done, no company will be crazy enough to block traffic to the government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They weren&#39;t when I looked.</p>

<p>So I went and checked again, and yeah a few subs are missing, like ours now.</p>

<p>I looked to see if it tells you how long ago something in their wiki is updated. That&#39;s where they have their secondary list, where a few seem to be missing now.</p>

<p>Sure enough, it was updated 2 hours ago. Right after I looked and made my comment, basically.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t know if they just &quot;changed their mind&quot;, or if they removed some subs like this one because people are talking about it.</p>

<p>Hell, first time I visited was just now, through your link, and in literally the <em>first two threads</em> I clicked on the comments weren&#39;t about admiring &quot;white beauty,&quot; they were about <a href="https://i.imgur.com/mMCk9Ss.jpg">using it to make racist comments</a>.</p>

<p>And then you look at the mods.</p>

<p>Yeah, when &quot;GreatApeNiggy&quot; is a mod of your sub, you&#39;re for <em>sure</em> just a good honest sub devoted to beautiful pictures.</p>

<p>Sure thing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just more childish games of transparent bigotry masked by piss poor attempts at plausible deniability, all designed with the specific purpose of being able to generate outrage when they&#39;re called out and/or banned. &quot;We were just admiring beautiful white people! This is more racism against whites!&quot;</p>

<p>As noted, it&#39;s just more childish games of transparent bigotry masked by piss poor attempts at plausible deniability, all designed with the specific purpose of being able to generate outrage when they&#39;re called out and/or banned. &quot;We were just admiring beautiful white people!

<p>And I was able to demonstrate that in two seconds above. It&#39;s easy. The whole sub is just a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/isK1XgM.jpg">vehicle for bigoted comments</a> (that and the above all taken right from the first page, no searching needed). That&#39;s it&#39;s intended  purpose. To pretend it&#39;s one thing while actually serving as another.</p>

<p>And anyone claiming otherwise is completely full of shit.</p>

<p>Why are you concerned about speech you aren&#39;t even attempting to listen to?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;ve literally bought, privatized, and monopolized the public square, and now people defend them curtailing public speech because &quot;not government therefore no rights.&quot; Silencing of dissent is silencing of dissent. </p>

<p>Your Penguin books analogy is spurious bullshit, because if Penguin rejects writing, there are a multitude of other publishers and distributors, both physical and digital, as well as myriad ways to publish yourself, hook up with zines, etc. But FB, twat, reddit, yt, etc. are effecive monopolies on interactive public speech. Their power to enforce consensus, create authoritarian monocultures, and define the limits of acceptable speech is already immense. Why are you gladly giving them more power?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>...so multiple companies are a monopoly? I think the term you&#39;re looking for is &quot;oligopy,&quot; and even then this is easily disproven. Absolutely nothing is stopping any MDE or GA people from entering the market. Nothing. They can buy a virtual private server and slap reddit&#39;s open source code on it and have a complete carbon copy of reddit to host their platform on. There is nothing stopping them from starting their own website to hold discussions or post content.</p>

<p>You&#39;re sad and scared because <em>popular</em> platforms are not condoning toxic delusions and racism. You don&#39;t want a platform, you want a <em>popular</em> platform. Too bad. The market has determined that these viewpoints are not worthwhile, popular, or conducive to their platforms. If something thinks otherwise then they can enter the market with absolutely no competition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the problem. It had two years of propaganda. And the problem I have with Republicans is their pussies. They refused to fight the fact the coporate clearly control the media. </p>

<p>They refused to fight the fact that they are censoring any non democrat Outlets so that only Democrats control the media. And then they complain the Democrats are so stupid because of the media propaganda</p>

<p>you want to end  all this crap (and Republicans supposedly shoud)? Pass a law against hrc collusion with media. Pass a law preventing Facebook Twitter Google excetera from censoring independent outlets</p>

<p>But Republicans won&#39;t. Nobody will. Democrats won&#39;t because they&#39;re corrupt. And Republicans won&#39;t because their pussies</p>

<p>The fact is. Congress could end this with a simple legislation.</p>

<p>And Trump has the authority to end it without Congressional approval at all</p>

<p>Trump could order fcc to clamp down harder</p>

<p>Obama was able to pass unilateral executive orders using these agencies without any Congressional approval. Trump could do the same.</p>

<p>But he won&#39;t.</p>

<p>Trump could order the FCC to audit conservative censorship online.</p>

<p>You can order them to classify Facebook Google Twitter Youtube excetera is Public Utilities or public forums. And therefore enforce free speech on them.</p>

<p>that would solve the issue right there. And it would take a stroke of his pen</p>

<p>you could order the FCC to create new rules. Without classifying Facebook as a public utility</p>

<p>And again it will be perfectly legal</p>

<p>But he won&#39;t.</p>

<p>He could even order the FEC Federal Election Commission 2 consider the censorship of conservatives and promotion of liberals as political donations and to impose heavy fines on things such as Facebook for not properly documenting these donations and potentially not registering as Democrats super Pacs</p>

<p>That too would solve the problem. But he won&#39;t do that either. Mainly because his supporters in the Republican party don&#39;t seem to want him to. the people crying the hardest about the problem don&#39;t seem to want the problem to be solved</p>

<p>All of these things would solve the problem immediately. With minimal to no side  effects</p>

<p>He could even order the FCC to impose stricter versions of the rules that already has against fake news. Because there&#39;s already Provisions against deliberately reporting false information with the intention of misleading</p>

<p>And there&#39;s plenty of other things he could d</p>

<p>And all it would take is people to ask him to do it.</p>

<p>But apparently the people affected by it are more interested in complaining than actually fixing the problem</p>

<p>Because thus far  every single proposed solution has been attacked and struck down by the Republicans who were affected </p>

<p>Usually because they have some religious belief that the &quot;free market&quot; is going to take care of all their problems even though it hasn&#39;t and it won&#39;t</p>

<p>since every day that passes that the free market is in charge of it it actually gets worse instead of better so clearly the free market is NOT going to fix the problem</p>

<p>But like I said that&#39;s the problem. Democrats -who seem to be the only ones not afraid to pass legislation- won&#39;t do it because they&#39;re corrupt and benefiting from it</p>

<p>and Republicans won&#39;t do it because they have a phobia of legislation ( unless of course it&#39;s corrupt legislation such as bills that allow direct violations of the Fourth Amendment and warrantless spying on all Americans. Then both parties support it no problem) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, theirs currently a parody H3h3_productions subredit shilling for the republican party, could be that. So could be that reddit their referencing. </p>

<p>Secondly, h3h3 reddit and fans have had some run ins with right wing theorys and of course the lobster man Jordan peterson. 
This supports the theory this is all a witch hunt, with some admin running away with the idea of banning any &#39;controversial&#39; (proper big air quotes) sub reddits.</p>

<p>For op to run away with the idea that theirs a conspiracy to delete HUGE sub reddits and have no back lash, or that theirs a left wing agenda to reddit (when reddit has allowed one of the largest collection of alt-right fans in the world, the Donald, to exist for a long time) is rediculous. </p>

<p>No one seems to note that the reddits that actually have dissappeared are pretty racist. Maybe, just maybe the admin are removing alot of the racists.</p>

<p>Also, if OP is right, we&#39;ll see the evidence soon, and by then the whole of reddit will explode from up roar. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact is. Congress could end this with a simple legislation.</p>

<p>And Trump has the authority to end it without Congressional approval at all</p>

<p>Trump could order fcc to clamp down harder</p>

<p>Obama was able to pass unilateral executive orders using these agencies without any Congressional approval. Trump could do the same.</p>

<p>But he won&#39;t.</p>

<p>Trump could order the FCC to audit conservative censorship online.</p>

<p>You can order them to classify Facebook Google Twitter Youtube excetera is Public Utilities or public forums. And therefore enforce free speech on them.</p>

<p>that would solve the issue right there. And it would take a stroke of his pen</p>

<p>you could order the FCC to create new rules. Without classifying Facebook as a public utility</p>

<p>And again it will be perfectly legal</p>

<p>But he won&#39;t.</p>

<p>He could even order the FEC Federal Election Commission 2 consider the censorship of conservatives and promotion of liberals as political donations and to impose heavy fines on things such as Facebook for not properly documenting these donations and potentially not registering as Democrats super Pacs</p>

<p>That too would solve the problem. But he won&#39;t do that either. Mainly because his supporters in the Republican party don&#39;t seem to want him to. the people crying the hardest about the problem don&#39;t seem to want the problem to be solved</p>

<p>All of these things would solve the problem immediately. With minimal to no side  effects</p>

<p>He could even order the FCC to impose stricter versions of the rules that already has against fake news. Because there&#39;s already Provisions against deliberately reporting false information with the intention of misleading</p>

<p>And there&#39;s plenty of other things he could d</p>

<p>And all it would take is people to ask him to do it.</p>

<p>But apparently the people affected by it are more interested in complaining than actually fixing the problem</p>

<p>Because thus far  every single proposed solution has been attacked and struck down by the Republicans who were affected </p>

<p>Usually because they have some religious belief that the &quot;free market&quot; is going to take care of all their problems even though it hasn&#39;t and it won&#39;t</p>

<p>since every day that passes that the free market is in charge of it it actually gets worse instead of better so clearly the free market is NOT going to fix the problem</p>

<p>But like I said that&#39;s the problem. Democrats -who seem to be the only ones not afraid to pass legislation- won&#39;t do it because they&#39;re corrupt and benefiting from it</p>

<p>and Republicans won&#39;t do it because they have a phobia of legislation ( unless of course it&#39;s corrupt legislation such as bills that allow direct violations of the Fourth Amendment and warrantless spying on all Americans. Then both parties support it no problem) </p>

<p>oh wait. Is currently no regulation on these things which means the free market <strong>IS</strong> in charge of this part of the internet</p>

<p>And guess what? Under the free market it keeps getting worse. So clearly the libertarian worship of corporations that they refer to as &quot;free market&quot; isn&#39;t working. And something else needs to be tried. </p>

<p>But of course they won&#39;t. Because there too hung up on ideology. And according to them if the ideology doesn&#39;t work you just need to Double down</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the problem on either side is in <em>understanding</em>.  I think the problem is two-fold.  One, sociopaths in positions of power.  Two, appealing to authority.</p>

<p>Well, of course the problem is bigger and more complex than that.  And overall, it comes down to ignorance in the general population, which is of course synonymous with a lack of understanding.  But when it comes to specific issues (such as net neutrality), I don&#39;t think the root problem is a lack of understanding.  I think it&#39;s that too many people who take a stance <em>don&#39;t even care about understanding or truth</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Divided Republican Views on Net Neutrality</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the most interesting aspects of this argument is the nature in which Republican views on Net Neutrality are divided. In general, Republican voters tend to be in favor of Net Neutrality, while Republican office-holders tend to be against it. A series of national polls show that up to 85% of Republicans are opposed to internet service providers (ISPs) charging web companies fees to transfer their information more quickly. This is actually higher than the percent of Democrats who opposed this situation, which was 81%. However, in Congress, only 15 Republicans voted against the repeal of Net Neutrality, as opposed to 215 who voted in favor.</p>

<p>Hm, really?  Because you seem to be adamantly defending them all throughout this thread.</p>

<p>These guys&#39; whole thing is trying to troll and &quot;trigger&quot; the rest of Reddit and then scampering back to their hideouts to giggle about it.  Turns out that the thing that triggers them the most is having their meeting places shut down.   So I think that the admins should continue doing exactly that until they finally admit defeat and migrate elsewhere.  Then the ones who don&#39;t leave and continue to show their faces in the main subs will be publicly shamed, just like they deserve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the problem. It had two years of propaganda. And the problem I have with Republicans is their pussies. They refused to fight the fact the coporate clearly control the media. </p>

<p>They refused to fight the fact that they are censoring any non democrat Outlets so that only Democrats control the media. And then they complain the Democrats are so stupid because of the media propaganda</p>

<p>you want to end  all this crap (and Republicans supposedly shoud)? Pass a law against hrc collusion with media. Pass a law preventing Facebook Twitter Google excetera from censoring independent outlets</p>

<p>But Republicans won&#39;t. Nobody will. Democrats won&#39;t because they&#39;re corrupt. And Republicans won&#39;t because their pussies</p>

<p>The fact is. Congress could end this with a simple legislation.</p>

<p>And Trump has the authority to end it without Congressional approval at all</p>

<p>Trump could order fcc to clamp down harder</p>

<p>Obama was able to pass unilateral executive orders using these agencies without any Congressional approval. Trump could do the same.</p>

<p>But he won&#39;t.</p>

<p>Trump could order the FCC to audit conservative censorship online.</p>

<p>You can order them to classify Facebook Google Twitter Youtube excetera is Public Utilities or public forums. And therefore enforce free speech on them.</p>

<p>that would solve the issue right there. And it would take a stroke of his pen</p>

<p>you could order the FCC to create new rules. Without classifying Facebook as a public utility</p>

<p>And again it will be perfectly legal</p>

<p>But he won&#39;t.</p>

<p>He could even order the FEC Federal Election Commission 2 consider the censorship of conservatives and promotion of liberals as political donations and to impose heavy fines on things such as Facebook for not properly documenting these donations and potentially not registering as Democrats super Pacs</p>

<p>That too would solve the problem. But he won&#39;t do that either. Mainly because his supporters in the Republican party don&#39;t seem to want him to. the people crying the hardest about the problem don&#39;t seem to want the problem to be solved</p>

<p>All of these things would solve the problem immediately. With minimal to no side  effects</p>

<p>He could even order the FCC to impose stricter versions of the rules that already has against fake news. Because there&#39;s already Provisions against deliberately reporting false information with the intention of misleading</p>

<p>And there&#39;s plenty of other things he could d</p>

<p>And all it would take is people to ask him to do it.</p>

<p>But apparently the people affected by it are more interested in complaining than actually fixing the problem</p>

<p>Because thus far  every single proposed solution has been attacked and struck down by the Republicans who were affected </p>

<p>Usually because they have some religious belief that the &quot;free market&quot; is going to take care of all their problems even though it hasn&#39;t and it won&#39;t</p>

<p>since every day that passes that the free market is in charge of it it actually gets worse instead of better so clearly the free market is NOT going to fix the problem</p>

<p>But like I said that&#39;s the problem. Democrats -who seem to be the only ones not afraid to pass legislation- won&#39;t do it because they&#39;re corrupt and benefiting from it</p>

<p>and Republicans won&#39;t do it because they have a phobia of legislation ( unless of course it&#39;s corrupt legislation such as bills that allow direct violations of the Fourth Amendment and warrantless spying on all Americans. Then both parties support it no problem) </p>

<p>Don&#39;t give Nazis a platform, that&#39;s how we got Nazis in the first place. Germany let them speak and say what they believed, and normalised it. Then Germany had a constitutional, Nazis took control of the state and began their third reich. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah that would be ideal but that&#39;s even more unrealistic than assuming the Republicans would step up and pass the legislation against this</p>

<p>I mean who would even be that third party? The libertarian party? They&#39;re even more against legislation than the Republicans</p>

<p>The Green Party? They&#39;re further to the left than the Democrats and would probably be just as in favor of  censorship</p>

<p>Not to mention that neither party can get even 20% of the  vote.</p>

<p>The reality is you have two choices. Democrat or Republican. And occasionally you can elect somebody who&#39;s hated by both of them like Donald trump</p>

<p>But you&#39;re not going to get a third party unfortunately</p>

<p>it&#39;s just still so ridiculous that the Republican Party won&#39;t passed legislation that helps the Republican party</p>

<p>regardless of your size you can&#39;t deny that he does have a bit of an ego. And he&#39;s expressed before that he wouldnt be ideologically bound to libertarianism</p>

<p>the fact is Trump is the most likely person. Because of how attacked he is by the media. Because of how directly affected he is by all of it. Someone like Marco Rubio wouldn&#39;t care because he&#39;s only in it for the money. As long as his donors keep pouring in the money he&#39;ll vote for whatever they tell him to. Because he knows theyll just help him get reelected</p>

<p>Trump is the kind of person who would be personally invested in it. So out of all the people you could vote for Trump would literally be one of the most likely people to want to pass some kind of executive order on it</p>

<p>I for one, if I do not like something I simply dont engage with it, i can block it, I can just ignore it. But I am not and never was in support of fascist/orwellian tactic of sensorships of freedom of expression and free of speech. </p>

<p>So, now we have an internet where the biggest sites with a monopoly acting like they have the rights to take away rights because the internet is nobodies and private entities can do as they please. Well, no they cants. We have universals freedom of speech and it should be enforced on the web as a basic human right. Corporations and right enteties should not have the privalage of doing what ever the fuck they want. Just because you are rich enough to afford slaves, doesnt mean you have authoroty over someone(we managed to figure that one out, but that needed a war). So fast forward and once again, people defending this injustice because they were spoon fed some bullshit buzzwords like &#39;hatespeech&#39; and now sensorship is a go.  Reddit died for me soon after 2016, and since its just getting worse, posts policed by bots and shill ready to mass downvote your against the narrative comment. And promote some bullshit to the top. Its manipulated, its rigged, its no longer the user generated platform it used to be. I am just here for the lolz and habbit now. But its not like i will miss it dearly when its gone. Il just find some other sources to fill my informational void. Reddit and such spawned many alternatives and 4chan still exists. Be it without beastiality, which makes me question if the site has gone lighter for purposes to appease the rulers(who ever rules over 4 chan to make it sensor its origional wildwest sesspool of a anon posting board. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like flat earth stuff. You know it&#39;s bullshit and almost everything you hear about it can easily be disputed, but sometimes i hear an argument that i can&#39;t refuse right of the bat. I still know it&#39;s bullshit, but i wouldn&#39;t be able to explain why.  So i look it up and get smarter along the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I do, but unfortunately I think the modern &quot;progressive&quot; aka authoritarian regressive is simply incapable of debate at this point. It would be like debating a member of the west boro baptist church or a young earth creationist. There is no logic or level-headedness; no desire to develop a greater understanding of your beliefs and the opposition. All there is is blind emotion, personal attacks, and threats of violence/death. I am not a &quot;progressive&quot; in the slightest, but I could probably represent them well enough in a debate just because I&#39;ve taken the time to understand where they come from, what they desire, and what their prime driving motivators are. </p>

 If Reddit did get shut down I personally wouldn&#39;t miss it.

Third party organisations have seen how powerful social media can be in getting their message across, from now on there will never be a popular social media site like Reddit that will not come under attack of astroturfing, manipulation, political biases, simply because if you control Reddit, you control what millions of people see. </p>

<p>If that wasn&#39;t bad enough you also have the astroturfers who push advertising for products, pretending to be normal users. Check out <a href="/r/hailcorporate">/r/hailcorporate</a> for examples.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looking through the supermod list, I keep looking at how many of them have built their power on modding several of the uncontroversial, upbeat, but really quite personal subs I have enjoyed, and I&#39;ll never be able to take part in those without seeing the rot at the heart of them. To use things like users&#39; pictures/stories of their beloved pets, some no longer with us, to build your personal power in order to abuse it... It actually turns my stomach. </p>

<p>Yes, many of these banned &amp; about to be banned subs are grotesque to me; that&#39;s why I don&#39;t visit them. It&#39;s easy for me to ignore them. What&#39;s not easy to ignore is the authoritarian monoculture that is being grown and nurtured each time one of them is axed.</p>

<p>They see Republicans is the opposition. Republicans would be stupid not to see them as the opposition</p>

<p>we can&#39;t and probably won&#39;t have unity in the country. Not as long as both sides are warring against each other. Not so long as the media constantly manipulates the left into rioting. No. As long as you support freedom of the press which supposedly means the media can lie. Then we&#39;re not going to have Unity. Since we need to stop pretending that it&#39;s actually possible.

<p>Why should comcast let that content through their pipes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Comcast thinks it is in their best interest to block a certain type of content then they are more than free to do so just like when they blocked traffic to bit torrent sites in the past. Once something like that happens it is up to Comcast&#39;s customers to contact the company to voice their displeasure and close their accounts and force Comcast to reverse their decision because blocking a certain type of traffic will hurt Comcast&#39;s bottom line.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AT&amp;T is a private company, why can&#39;t they choose what content to block?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They can, they&#39;ll just piss off their customers so they better have a good excuse for choosing which content to block. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those fiber lines cross through government property, why can&#39;t they choose what goes through it? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read up on the NSA&#39;s Prism program, the government dictates to communication companies what they want done, no company will be crazy enough to block traffic to the government. </p>
