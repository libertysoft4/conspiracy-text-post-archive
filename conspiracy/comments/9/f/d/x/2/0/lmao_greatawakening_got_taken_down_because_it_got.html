        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The great awakening is real, and if you disagree then try to deny the movement. Seriously. You can’t. Like actually try and do it. The Q movement is undeniably Donald trump and his team, which is something everyone should know by now, and the left wing has been hijacked by the evil cabal, like the last multiple presidents. Trump is an anomaly, an outsider from the political arena, and look he is actually doing a good job in terms of actually results  . Despite all the hate propagated by the deep state and his personal cocky ass attitude, he manages to produce good changes that people like, and promises more. The human trafficking arrests under trump are unprecedented and interesting despite the previous’ lack of ability to do much on the issue and the 50,000+ sealed indictments that are just building up.</p>

<p>There were bots on the sub hard for so long and it was full of shills. It makes sense: It was too good of a platform. Too good for the movement. You can’t be ignorant to this for too long because FISA should declass in the next couple weeks, and the IG report will reveal itself at the best time. I don’t want to call out conspiracy because it’s a good sub, just way too much info, a platform like this allows for a lot of interference and dilution. </p>

<p>Anyway Q is real and Trump is coming with Sessions and they will drain the f’in swamp.</p>

<p>This sub is literally conspiracy, and Q confirms the fact that their are massive conspiracies. Like this sub is around because people think a lot of the stuff related with Q is real. You just have to connect the dots.</p>

<p>Conspiracy no more.

    <div class="md"><p>What if...now hear me out on this one... the Q movement is nothing but just another tactic used by said Deep State in order to control and pacify the part of the population who is actually awake and realizes that not all is at it seems, specifically pertaining to government and state matters. How many people passionately believe in this Q movement? A large amount of people.   </p>

<p>That large amount people now think there are &#39;good guys&#39; in our government battling the Deep State, causing them to relax just a bit, just enough to not actually rise up and do anything themselves because they think somebody is already inside, doing it for them.   </p>

<p>Is that possible?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw a post on here the other day that explained the indictments pretty well... Basically the number is not including the ones that get unsealed (and aren&#39;t actually relevant to this deep state conspiracy), so that&#39;s why the number just keeps growing.</p>

<p>But even if it was true, you really think it&#39;s a good thing for a president to suddenly arrest 50,000 of his political opponents? If it was anyone else, you would probably call it a power grab by an authoritarian dictator.</p>

<p>I would be open to the fact that Q is a part of a much bigger conspiracy indeed, but it is the best chance we have and it’s almost undeniable at this point. Also I am not really a Christian at all, but I believe we have a creator and that there is a difference between good and bad that our higher selves can differentiate. Things go super deep and there is nothing wrong with praying to a lord for good. Thoughts have affects believe it or not</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe without a doubt that many, if not most, at the highest levels of world influence are involved in pedophilia, ritualistic or otherwise. The disconnect with Q is pretending as if the Trump&#39;s are not also involved or that conservative religious people aren&#39;t among the absolute worst offenders. Q started out as a troll but now has all the hallmarks of a dedicated disinformation campaign. If good and bad were things that our higher selves could differentiate, the philosophy of ethics wouldn&#39;t be necessary and ethics would not improve over time in progressive, secular societies. Ethics do not improve nearly as rapidly in religious societies. The facts are against your viewpoint. </p>

<p>Couple things I find odd about this statement.  &quot;Q&quot; is a group of people, not an individual.  Is it normal for a &quot;cult&quot; leader to remain anonymous, not ask for any money, never tell anyone at all what to do?  Doesn&#39;t seem like any cult leader or religious head  I&#39;ve ever heard of.     </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>This seems odd to you?  There are tens of million of people, right now, flipping their shit over anonymous sources, who heard an un-named person saying bad things about Trump.  It made the New York Times for Christ sake.  This right after we have, no kidding, actual document proof that the most senior members of the FBI had a media leak strategy to damage/destroy an elected president.    </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Maybe it is a sham, it&#39;s very possible, but what&#39;s the damage.  People doing a shit ton of research on member of their government and government agencies?  I mean, you may laugh at people who think there is a deep state all you want but call them a cult?  Seems a little projectionist to me.  Are you in the 9-11 cult?  The Kennedy assasination cult?  How about the UFO cult, Federal Reserve cult?   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think anyone could make a reasonable criticism about the idea of the existence of a Deep State. The deep state undoubtedly exists. The cult aspect is how Q proponents worship president Trump and literally believe they are in a supernatural battle with the forces of evil. There is not one Cabal. There are numerous groups of people with power who have different end-goals that coincide more often than not. Trump is part of a cabal as well. His cabal just happens to be grossly incompetent and bad at covering up their criminal activities. Just because one mafioso group is mad that an upstart mafioso group is gaining more power doesn&#39;t mean I have to support either. That&#39;s my problem with Q followers. </p>

<p>There are only 1 reason in my opinion... Because it&#39;s controlled.</p>

<p>I certainly hope you don&#39;t have any Q subs removed, but I&#39;m pretty sure if you are on the level, that you will see it removed.</p>
