        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>May 8th</strong> - Elon Musk and Grimes <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/videos/life/people/2018/05/08/elon-musk-dating-grimes-and-internet-cant-handle-/34680323/">make their relationship</a> public.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>August 2nd</strong> - The last day that Canadian musician Claire Bouchard, also known as Grimes, <a href="https://twitter.com/Grimezsz/status/1025138010084368384">posted anything on social media</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been <strong>40 days since</strong>.</p>

<p>And consider how odd this is. Grimes isn&#39;t a huge star. She is under 1 million followers on all of her accounts. Her success and growth depends on engaging her community and growing her fan base.</p>

<p>She&#39;s hasn&#39;t gone this long without posting.</p>

<p>And it hurts her career. Every day, she loses out on engaging fans.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>August 7th</strong> - Elon Musk tweets about &quot;Tesla going private at $420 per share.&quot; This never happens, and there&#39;s a lot of evidence that it was never even close.</p>

<p>Obviously, it&#39;s a stressful week for Elon Musk. The SEC starts investigating almost immediately, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/15/business/tesla-musk-sec-subpoena-goldman.html">sends subpoenas</a> to Elon Musk, Tesla, and the Tesla Board.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>August 10th - 11th</strong> - Musician Azealia Banks <a href="https://twitter.com/cloudbustings/status/1028524808525492224">posts</a> a <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/08/azealia-bankss-feud-elon-musk-grimes-explained.html">series of alarming Instagram stories</a>.</p>

<p>She claims that she was at Elon Musk&#39;s house, and was trapped their like the move &quot;Get Out.&quot;</p>

<p>She claims that Grimes invited her over to do a collaboration, but spent all her time consoling Musk over the fact that he tweeted while on drugs and was now in trouble. She suspected that Grimes just wanted a threesome with Elon or something.</p>

<p><strong>As far as I can see, Azealia Banks is the last person to have publicly said she saw Grimes alive</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>August 16th</strong> - Elon Musk gives <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/business/elon-musk-interview-tesla.html">an emotional interview</a> to the New York Times.</p>

<p>In it, he says this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The worst is over from a Tesla operational standpoint. But from a personal pain standpoint, the worst is yet to come</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p><strong>August 18th</strong> - After denying seeing Azealia Banks on his property, Musk <a href="https://jezebel.com/elon-musk-confirms-the-azealia-banks-stake-out-1828438202">flip-flops</a> and confirms that he saw her.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>August 18th, Part 2</strong> - Azealia Banks accuses Musk of stealing Grimes&#39; phone and faking a conversation with her.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/fuckrashida/status/1030958564519555073">The conversation makes claims that</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Elon has a fake accent</li>
<li>Elon has a big dick</li>
<li>Elon is very &quot;open minded&quot;</li>
<li>Elon does lots of drugs</li>
</ul>

<h2>This is huge</h2>

<p>Scenario A) She&#39;s right, and Elon Musk has taken Grimes&#39; phone. Why would he do that?</p>

<p>Scenario B) She&#39;s wrong, and she&#39;s talking with Grimes, in which case Azealia Banks just posted a very private conversation. I&#39;d be pissed if those details about my private life leaked.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>August 19th</strong> - The media discovers that <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/08/elon-musk-and-grimes-unfollow-each-other-on-social-media.html">Grimes and Elon have both unfollowed</a> each other on social media.</p>

<p>It&#39;s assumed they&#39;ve broken up.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>August 21st</strong> - Elon Musk <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-appears-delete-instagram-azealia-banks-2018-8">deletes his Instagram</a> account.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>August 21st, Part 2</strong> - A prominent Hollywood gossip blogger posts <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/08/blind-item-2_21.html">this</a> &quot;Blind Item&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those two blonde hookers and the coke orgy was just too much for this one named foreign born singer. She got into a knock down drag out fight with her A list celebrity boyfriend and then left him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Was this about Elon and Grimes?</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>September 2nd</strong> - It&#39;s now been 30 days since Grimes&#39; last post on social media</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>September 7th</strong> - The prominent Hollywood gossip blogger posts <a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/09/four-for-friday-he-tried-to-kill-them.html">this</a> blind item.</p>

<p>Was this about Elon, his first or second wife, and Grimes?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you ask this foreign born B+ list mostly television actress who is on hit show, she will say the details are fuzzy. She remembers coming home from a set where she was filming a movie which was a smalllllll budget film. The hours were long, and the pay not so great. The movie did really well compared to its budget. Anyway, she got home late and when she walked in the door, he slammed her into a wall by the door. There was a painting on the wall and it dropped on her head and his because of how violently he slammed her body into the wall. She says she lost her breath and couldn&#39;t answer when he was asking about an actor on the set and whether she was sleeping with him. Because she couldn&#39;t answer, he assumed she was sleeping with him. He then took out a knife and held it to her throat before punching her. She blacked out. She says she woke up about 12 hours later and he wasn&#39;t in the house. She had bruises all over her body. She packed up her bags and walked out and has not spoken to him since.</p>

<p>Apparently <strong>this foreign born singer has been hospitalized for nearly a month</strong> because of the beating she took from the same man. She also says he held a knife to her throat and that he could kill her and no one would care. Unlike the victim above, our singer says she was awake for every bit of the beating. Apparently she didn&#39;t show what he thought was a proper level of appreciation for a gift he got her. It was a bronzed bangle bracelet that was an antique. He used that to beat her and then raped her while screaming at her that she should have thanked him and all of it could have been avoided. Later, after he left, she also walked away, but left most of her possessions because she was worried he would come back.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p><strong>September 7th, Part 2</strong> - Elon Musk and Caity Lotz flirt on Twitter:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/caitylotz/status/1038282703672508416">https://twitter.com/caitylotz/status/1038282703672508416</a></p>

<p>Worth mentioning that, according to Elon&#39;s first wife, he loves blondes.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>September 9th</strong> - Elon Musk is seen without Grimes at an eSport event for League of Legends.</p>

<p>He&#39;s also with Tesla&#39;s lawyer and an independent member of the Tesla Board of Directors.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TeslaCharts/status/1038945913161609216">https://twitter.com/TeslaCharts/status/1038945913161609216</a></p>

<p><strong>September 10th</strong> - Same blogger posts these tweets:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear ________________ (random business news reporters)</p>

<p>About your @elonmusk inquiry. Yes, he uses drugs other than pot.  Yes, I wonder how much his first wife is paid to stay quiet. Yes, I have met his second wife. Yes, I know his drug dealer.</p>

<p>Yes, I wonder if he will go on a killing spree. Yes, I track his flights. Yes, I have spoken to some of his overnight friends. Yes, he was out of control at Burning Man. Yes, you should ask @AZEALIABANKSNYC for a quote. Buy some soap first though.</p>

<p>Oh, and yes, he wants to be on Dancing With The Stars.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p><strong>September 11th</strong> - Azealia Banks posts a (now deleted) tweet.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/arbissell/status/1039888065508958208">https://twitter.com/arbissell/status/1039888065508958208</a></p>

<p>She says &quot;@elonmusk please don&#39;t kill me :(&quot;</p>

<p>We are now on day 40</p>

<p>She still manages to lurk on Instagram.</p>

<p>r/conspiracy has become TMZ. trust, i love to hate elon too but this shit just needs to go on another board. you could replace the names of these people with other famous people and it would still be a tale as old as time. drugs, infidelity, beatings, secret meetings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Musk&#39;s frauds are starting to unravel. People think his stock price dropped because he smoked weed and the &quot;uptight&quot; wall street world freaked out. Wall street types could care less, they lost faith because Musk was exposed as a fraud on Rogan&#39;s podcast. His answers were rambling and he had no real vision for any of his projects. He was acting, playing the character of some aloof genius and wall street didn&#39;t like it.</p>

<p>Wall street will invest in a fraud as long as it is making money, once they detect the fraud is about to be exposed, they sell. Investors are VERY smart, and they see Musk&#39;s fraud is about to be exposed.</p>

<p>All this talk about him working 24 hours a day is also a fraud by Musk. He hardly works, he&#39;s partying all the time. Notice how the only one putting out the news of his long hours is Musk himself?</p>

Those Blind items <em>possibly</em> allude to Musk and him being abusive. They also allude to Musk beating Grimes, possibly killing her? In the mix of all this, she&#39;s been gone for 40 days, which is odd for a singer like her.</p>

<p>MISDIRECTED EMAIL SPARKS ELECTRIC CAR WAR BETWEEN TESLA AND ECOTRICITY</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The email basically said that two senior people were flying out the following Wednesday, they were going to blacken our name with the Government, work with our motorway partners to help them break contract with us, and use the media to show us up as the bad guys,” Mr Vince told The Independent.</p>

<p>He was particularly angered by what appeared to be the suggestion of covert approaches to motorway service stations, saying that this would be in breach of a non-disclosure agreement that Ecotricity had signed with Tesla under which the US firm was given confidential information. <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/misdirected-email-sparks-electric-car-war-between-tesla-and-ecotricity-9533260.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/misdirected-email-sparks-electric-car-war-between-tesla-and-ecotricity-9533260.html</a>  </p>

Though money can buy silence, it is doubtful that - even if sonething happened, not saying it did - you could shut up everyone close to her.

sense to me than her just being dead. Also perhaps she is just being paid to keep off the grid and media for awhile, or forever. </p>
