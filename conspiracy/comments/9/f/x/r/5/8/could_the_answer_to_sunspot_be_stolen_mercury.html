    <div class="md"><p>Metallic mercury really isn&#39;t too bad as long as you keep it cool enough to avoid evaporation.  Mercury fumes are absorbed by the lungs, acting as a bioaccumulative toxin.</p>

<p>But you&#39;re buying from some dude in a ship-breaking yard in India, so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there were a whole bunch of impurities in there.  </p>

<p>Dimethyl mercury is acutely and terminally toxic.  A professor named Karen Wetterhahn splashed a couple drops on her hand.  She was wearing a latex lab glove at the time, but she still died within a year.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good point.  And in bulk it&#39;s extremely heavy.  </p>

<p>This may explain it?  Saw this while researching it:</p>

<p>Also saw that someone claiming to work there has the same idea but a little different than my theory.  It may make more sense:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Honestly if something happened I&#39;d be betting on the gallons of Mercury that are used as a [mechanical] bearing for the telescope proper.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is what I have asserted. It seems like terrorists/organized crime stole some waste mercury for use as a radiotracer. Perhaps someone wanted to triangulate where USPS parcels are searched for contraband.</p>

<p>The FBI can&#39;t really just announce &#39;several dozen gallons of carbocationic mercury were stolen from the NSF&#39;; because that kind of information would serve as an advertisement for the black market.</p>

<p>If the other telescopes have similar machines with similar waste, then I&#39;m willing to bet that North Korea tried to steal all of the carbocationic mercury it could get its hands on, at once. Then, they&#39;ll use it for pentesting the physical security at international borders and transportation routes. They will then use that information to procure illegal nuclear materials on the black market.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My first thought is how would mercury help them find where the USPS searches packages or weak spots in border security?  I looked through those links but I did not see an explanation for either of those questions.</p>

<p>My second thought is that there must be a better way to go about it than using a few hundred gallons of highly toxic liquid metal that have to be stolen from muliple locations spread across the US.  Did NK smuggle in a bunch of spies. Or did they actually manage to corrupt enough telescope nerds to do it for them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My initial thoughts after digging into this story was a mercury leak or theft. The problem with that in my mind now is that Sunspot&#39;s director said in a statement last night that this was not about mercury, that would involve a completely different evacuation protocol for employees. I guess the extent of their pre-evac prep was just locking doors (which would probably make it harder for any kind of first responders to enter the facility). Also, I&#39;m not sure if the price of mercury is high enough to warrant the trouble theft from an observatory would bring. On a side-note, White Sands is having a large hot air balloon festival this weekend, participants fly from WSMR to Alamogordo just outside of Sunspot. Maybe there was a threat to the festival.</p>
