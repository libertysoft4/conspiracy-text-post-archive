<p>Since Reddit admins are on a subreddit banning spree, why not add <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> to the list? Here we have an upvoted comment calling for violence against Congressmen in protest if Trump decides to fire Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein. Notice that comment has avoided moderation for 12 hours as of posting this thread.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie is a political nobody though. Hillary was the chosen candidate of the party since 2008. She isn&#39;t left-wing per se but her connections and interests align with them, pushing them forward. </p>

<p>Left-wing people should have voted for Trump given his populist, anti-war, and anti-globslist agenda that leftists were pushing for years. They never gave him that chance which proves to me that the American Left are Democrats. Some Bernie people may have defected but they aren&#39;t giving Trump credit today or in November despite doing what they wanted all along in many instances. </p>

<p>Any declared state of emergency will work. Trump added a new one last year under the premise of global corruption and human rights abuses.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And you trust the state to sweep up only the guilty?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Generally, no, but this would be one of the only ways to effectively deal with the problem once and for all. I would believe the results of the trials, they are not kangaroo courts. On the other hand, putting innocent people through that kind of nightmare would be injustice, even if they are acquitted. But if they are really guilty of treason, fuck them. </p>
