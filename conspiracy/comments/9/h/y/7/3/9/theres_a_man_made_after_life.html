<p>Let’s have a different discussion. Let’s say there is a man made afterlife. Christian religion tells us sinners go to hell and people who are saved go to heaven.

    <div class="md"><p>Don’t listen too much to the people in here, they don’t know as much as they think they do but they are trying to help you. </p>

<p>Firstly, you need to come away from your strict beliefs until you have further prove. Don’t go linking and solidifying any thoughts about man made after life etc. unless you have studied such areas with theoretical material and have strong, physical proof for such a thing. 
One example that springs to mind is the chakra system, very real and easy to achieve physical proof. This is a good foundation for exploring the unknown and unseen side of things, as you can use it for an anchor. </p>

<p>Secondly, your entire idea of the ‘after life’ is flawed. Autism is an Earthly issue, such a thing won’t even exist when the individual leaves the physical form when regressing inwards (or out, if the etheric body is developed). 
There are also a variety of things that can happen to you when your physical structure dies. Depends where you’ve come from and how far you are along Jacobs ladder. </p>

<p>You sound young, best thing for you to do is understand and keep repeating to yourself that the only thing you know is nothing. Thus, keeping all thoughts in a fluid state - until hard proof is achieved. </p>

<p>Schizophrenia like everything, has its esoteric meanings and implications. Your mind can be broken down and re-tuned to pick up different signals. Without a proper teacher, be very cautious about believing your own thoughts. You may very well be receiving audio hallucinations, but how do you know it is a separate entity from you? Also, if it is, how do you know it has your best interests in mind? Positive and negative is in everything. It helps to achieve balance; many beings of existence align with the negative - you would perceive negative to be bad. So be cautious. </p>

<p>Maybe spend less time on Twitch, and start getting some physical exercise and a grounding meditation. Close up the thoughts and switch off the internal dialogue for a bit so you can see the world with less distortion and ego. </p>

<p>Also one last thing, don’t go believing one religion over another. Every religion is full of half truths, with Hindu being the least distorted religion that is available to the masses. Heaven and Hell are two extremes. Somebody who raped a bunch of kids is not going to hell. Sorry but that just isn’t how things work. Karma is around though, unless you know how to work around it or rituals to clean yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve found that the deeper I dive into the nature of reality the stranger it seems to get. It may simply be that the infinite nature of existence refuses to let itself be grasped/known so if you start getting to close it will throw a new mystery at you.</p>

<p>I personally liken it to the Red Pill/Blue Pill paths in the Matrix. You could Blue Pill and not inquire further and be happy with life as it is, or you can Red Pill and see how far the rabbit hole goes. Just like in the movie the Matrix Neo (red pilled) can exist within the blue pill system without anyone suspecting, noticing, your Red Pill reality. While Neo could attempt to explain the whole red pill/matrix thing to the people within the matrix, this would probably result most people thinking he was crazy.</p>

<p>This is an analogy though, not to infer any knowledge on whether such a system exist. It&#39;s simply meant to illustrate the difficulty you may find when speaking on or explaining this particular situation your in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I believe I do know you! You are a part of me, as I am you. I don&#39;t always understand the synchronicity, but I know it. You do, too. Be gentle, allow yourself to trust, and say thank you often to those who give pure guidance. This life can be fun, especially for one&#39;s like you. You have gifts, and you must respect that...stay true to what is good, true, pure, and holy; and keep your mind there. All else fails into place. </p>
