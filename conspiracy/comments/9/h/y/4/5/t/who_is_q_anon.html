        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>To start I would like to admit I did not follow the &quot;Q Movement&quot; up till recently</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been watching Cosmic Disclosure since it started. If you missed it on September 11th Corey Goode recently commented on Q Anon. Claiming Q Anon is DoD (Department of Defense) I thought that was strange as I watched it but let it go.</p>

<p>When all the reddit banning went down. I started to think &quot;what is up with this Q Anon stuff?&quot; I randomly read this and that. Most of which seems like Pro-Trump nonsense, pushing patriotism and propaganda. </p>

<p>I remember hearing Joesph P. Farrell (On Dark Journalists) saying he thinks Q&#39;s native language wasn&#39;t english or Q Anon was some kind of AI.</p>

<p>Recently <a href="https://youtu.be/Ao-_gNI0grk">Simon Parkes</a> has come out saying Q is 4 men and an advanced AI.</p>

<p>So by happenstance I stumbled on <a href="https://m.youtube.com/user/erviewer">Edward Riordan</a>
A trained remote veiwer who was given a blind target that ended up being Q Anon. He admits the info may be wrong. Remote viewing is not 100%. However if you watch his videos it&#39;s freaky how well the RV lines up with the previously claimed statements. At one point he sees a group of men talking in a very secure location. Discussing how to get information out about transformative advanced technology. Two lines that stand out to me &quot;We found it!&quot; &amp; &quot;It reminds me of 2001 a space odyssey&quot;</p>

<p>8 days after Corey Goode claimed Q anon is DoD, Q Anon makes a post confirming the secret space program on September 19th. (Incase you didn&#39;t know Corey claims to of worked in the secret space program)</p>

<p>This leads one to believe Q Anon is a small collection of people along side an artificial intellegence working to disseminate information about transformative advanced technology and the secret space program.</p>

<p>Please follow and support <a href="https://www.patreon.com/EdwardRiordanRemoteViewing">Mr. Riordan</a> He seems like a genuine good guy. And tell me what you think about this info.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory on Q and Wikileaks is one an the same- accept every member of the team is being headhunted... </p>

<p>Imho</p>

<p>Julian Assange is a special agent of ASIS. (Which is likely, apart of the 5 eyes alliance)-</p>

<p>This means that Wikileaks is a likely NSA working group potentially known as project vigilant-</p>

<p>My theory: Project Vigilant was tasked with addressing an information leak with Bureau 121. A Hacking group national to North Korea.</p>

<p>In short North Korean hackers are who compromised HRC-</p>

<p>Project vigilant was a two part mission-</p>

<p>Agents within this NSA group are being tasked with both continuing, the continuity of government; as well as placing criminal or social redlines on the criminal parties.</p>

<p>HRC committed multiple crimes in office to appease the Obama administrations directives-</p>

<p>Bureau 121 had verifiable proof of these crimes-</p>

<p>(However due to international opposition and rank they choose to distribute this information to russia).</p>

<p>A NSA task force working with 5eyes intel soon formed &#39;Wikileaks&#39;-</p>

<p>After utilizing a short lived test model known as: DC Leaks, which was used to release information in a controlled environment, to take easing off the initial bureau 121 Hack-</p>

<p>The NSA only cares about continuity of government- They overview all western communications-</p>

<p>It was during obamas presidency that these leaks would prove: illegal occupancy in syria- the administrations backing of mercenary groups (i.e isis)- as well as the uranium one fiasco, haiti, and potentially 9/11-</p>

<p>Distributing the leaks to the public (at once) would have lead to world anarchy-</p>

<p>Shortly following wikileaks erection, the CIA (unaware of the NSA&#39;s participation), breached the group. Meet Adrian Lamo- Rip-</p>

<p>The cia used Lamo to attack the first &#39;planned-leaker&#39; to the projects order- (Manning)-</p>

<p>At that time another leaker came forward with information pertaining to the dnc leak. (Seth rich).</p>

<p>This was an unplanned leak which showed a concerted effort by the obama administration to violate the smooth transition of presidency act-</p>

<p>It was because the information was a threat to continuity of government that the NSA continued to engage in project vigilant-</p>

<p>Julian Assange became an international facecard for a prominent intelligence gathering institution; Which lead to the obama administration pursing him as an enemy of the state.</p>

<p>Obama amd HRC used GCHQ to monitor Julian and due to a planned distribution of proof- GCHQ went into the embassy to place an arrest on Julian Assange-</p>

<p>It was during this arrest that assange attempted to provide documentation of his security clearance&#39;s and right to produce leaks-</p>

<p>However, during the confrontation and due to the magnitude of the leaks / in addition to the intelligence gathered; GCHQ likely (and accidentally) engaged the target (Julian assange).</p>

<p>Firing a single bullet (or more) into his body.</p>

<p>The reason this was likely not mentioned to the public-</p>

<p>The Ecuadorian Embassy is a foreign nations soil.</p>

<p>Killing assange opens a wartime engagement between all allies of ecuador by the invading parties. (I.e. The united states and brittan vs. Ecuador, russia, china, iran, venezuala).</p>

<p>So killing assange within the embassy is/was a known act of war-</p>

<p>This lead to multiple &#39;falsifications of POL during the election&#39;. Hence Julians PGP being missing since october/2016-</p>

<p>Embassy cats twitter was also offline for several months following the &#39;initial /suspected raid&#39; further proving that assange was not in control of his accounts prior to this date.</p>

<p>It likely took multiple &#39;legal-steps&#39; to gain access of that twitter account. Hence it going back online only after the election was over.</p>

<p>The day assange (potentially died) is the very same day that HRC lost the election (behind closed doors).</p>

<p>While wikileaks is now a ghosted agency, being controlled by the cia.</p>

<p>Project vigilant is still active using the &#39;Q&#39; phantom/anon as its newest vehicle to articulate the material to the masses...</p>

<p>This is why wikileaks staff members stated they were no longer in control of wikileaks, and told users &#39;not to send in links&#39;-</p>

<p>The truth is it was obamas minions and crimes that everyone attempted to erase-</p>

<p>Now these specific situations are being approached by mueller, and acting parties; which seek to &#39;demote their validity&#39;.</p>

<p>It is basically a &#39;cleanup job&#39; fixing HRC&#39;s / bogus actions. (I.e. using illegal / insecure devices) which lead to multiple crimes coming to light to the general public-</p>

<p>I hope the FBI arrests Clinton and Obama-</p>

<p>They are no longer employeed by the criminal cartel in which they were, amd their reputation to the public is permanently soiled for their standing down on multiple federal crimes-</p>

<p>Its a new world now-</p>

<p>We can correct the record- Godspeed, guys-</p>

<p>Imho Comey took a bullet to change the entirety of the world. He wasn&#39;t a patsy, more then a man being caught between a rock and a hardspot.</p>

<p>Trump needs to come out with thefull truth-</p>

<p>The charade / sideshow is nothing more then a public theater- designed to keep the public at bay- however it will allow all these snakes to walk free-</p>

<p>They are afraid of what people like HRC can state on the record during an open trial (to anger the public)- (as she is a person &#39;in-the-know&#39;)-</p>

<p>She will use all information gained via her past position as Secretary of state, as leverage to avoid an arrest-</p>

<p>This creates an avenue of protection for her-</p>

<p>P.s. there is no such thing as: &quot;The Deep State&quot;</p>

<p>Stop saying that-</p>

<p>The truth is that: everyone in government is known-</p>

<p>Start being specific-</p>

<p>Specific people are fucking with you- Specific people are covering up crimes- Specific people deserve and have earned jail time-</p>

<p>Our accounting it to being some shadowy orginazation is pathetic-</p>

<p>These are real criminals, getting away with real crimes-</p>

<p>Trump is doing his best to follow the narratives which will be best for american continuity-</p>

<p>However overlooking treason of this magnitude is a violation of public trust- It is an insult to you, your family and every living prisoner in every jail in america-</p>

<p>Do not offer them your leniency--</p>

<p>Demand the full truth, and arrests of all participating criminals-</p>

<p>Demand justice for assange and seth rich- Demand justice for the deceit you have been saturated in-</p>

<p>Demand justice for america-</p>

<p>Demand a better tomorrow then today had ever been.</p>

<p>Because it is your children that are inheriting this world-</p>

<p>Nothing more, and nothing less-</p>

<p>Tl/Dr</p>

<p>Assanges death was caused by an accidental coup between the NSA and CIA because HRC couldnt be bothered to read a memo about hacking / protocol safety measures in 2013</p>

<p>Q could be everything from a group of geeks who started out as a LARP to someone in some intelligence agency.</p>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t really matter now because what I have seen is a lot bigger, the people gathered together for a common goal, the truth, to bring down the evil corrupt sick people in higher places and eventually all places.</p>

<p>For a better future. And because of that - I don&#39;t really think about who Q is or what Q is. Sure would be fun to know but at this point it feels like it doesn&#39;t matter. It is WE, THE PEOPLE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny how until recently everyone was talking about A.I. as if it&#39;s something we&#39;re working towards.  Now, it just seems like the media is just acting like it was always here.  Oh you know, that A.I....</p>

<p>Recently Elon&#39;s interview with Joe Rogan, he had a very pessimistic view, like it&#39;s too late.  Giving me the impression that he knows that A.I. is already here and is already unleashed.  It&#39;s not a huge stretch of the imagination that A.I. wouldn&#39;t just be given to the world freely.  </p>

<p>I think A.I. is already here and it&#39;s very likely that Q/Q team has access to this A.I.  When you read all the connections that Q has alluded to, in my mind, only an A.I. would be able to find all that information across the internet.  Basically I think the A.I. found all the available connections on the internet, catalogued them, and then gave the anons the keywords to find that information.  </p>

<p>Then there&#39;s probably the forecast modeling that can give probabilities of certain events happening, etc.  Anyway, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re entirely crazy. </p>

Elon and Joe we&#39;re talking about how monkey seem like this crazy Savage destructive community but us humans (being superior in intellect) dont seek to destroy the apes. Infact we, more or less, don&#39;t even realize they exist untill we see them on TV. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see why A.I. would try to murder all humans. We don&#39;t require the same resources. If anything they would just build a space shuttle and float untill the reached where ever they want. They have no life span. It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q (whom is to believed to be 1 or more people?) doesn’t drop facts as much as breadcrumbs in the form of questions. In fact, there are more questions then answers from what I recall. Once these questions are asked, Q researchers follow those breadcrumbs and often times, in attempting to answer these questions, bring facts to light. It’s a very clever leaking scheme.</p>
