<p>I think it would go a long way in confidence if axolotl_peyotl announced that he would post any contact to manipulate this subby.</p>

<p>Sure he could lie, and sure it may be a compromised account. but still IMHO this would help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone who wants to convince someone of something is lying to themselves. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to do anything as a human apart from breathing, so why convince someone to do anything else?</p>

<p>Free thought and respectful discussion is what every subreddit should strive for, but it is only encouraged on niche subreddits like r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>The problem I have seen is that too often people who want to convince someone of thinking in ONLY one way get too much attention because they confirm other people perceived needs of ONLY thinking in one way.</p>

<p>Leave us alone, we are talking about thinking, not how to convince anyone of anything... that is what we are trying to avoid becoming victims of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I agree.</p>

<p>I should have been more specific.</p>

<p>I guess what I think we want to hear is that axolotl_peyotl will post anytime someone tries to influence his decisions about this subby that is not a mod.</p>

<p>But then someone could influence a mod and get around it.</p>

<p>Maybe post if he is ever faced with an or else.</p>

<p>So axolotl_peyotl, if you are reading this. The question has changed a little.</p>

<p>Are you willing to post if you are contacted about how to run this subby, sans mods.</p>

<p>Post if you ever face an &quot;or else&quot; situation from anyone.</p>

<p>Think that makes more sense.</p>

<p>Thanks, Rockran.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it was posted, but then your reframing of the question made the exact same error. People attempt to influence the mods on how the sub is run hundreds of times a day, I was attempting to draw attention to the fact that your question, even reposed, is not useful.</p>

<p>You want to ask if anyone gives input on the running of the sub <em>that he feels some degree of obligation to follow.</em> But even then, not really a useful question. If the answer was yes, obviously part of that compulsion would be to answer no to questions such as this.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today in Yemen, our military continues to wage this interventionist war alongside Saudi Arabia unauthorized by Congress. The time for crocodile tears and baseless platitudes is over. Enough is enough. The U.S. must end its support for Saudi Arabia and stop waging interventionist wars that increase destruction, death and suffering around the world, drain our resources here at home and threaten our own national security. ~ Tulsi Gabbard</p>

<p>Oh, there&#39;s plenty of nasty comments and personal attacks that don&#39;t get removed or banned. If you question Shady Hook, Boston Finger Paint Hoax, The Jokeland Shooting, etc, you will be called all kinds of nasty names, and the mods leave that shit up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The short answer is no. </p>

<p>I get <em>loads</em> of threatening PMs though...most of them are generic and lambast me for spreading &quot;Russian propaganda&quot; or whatever the trending complaint of the day is against me (and the rest of the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> community).</p>

<p>However, I&#39;ve never been pressured by someone with <em>authority</em> to do things differently here. </p>

<p>In addition, I&#39;m not &quot;in control&quot; of this sub. The moment I abuse my position and break reddit rules I&#39;m outta here. Sure, my voice has weight, but at this point my greatest asset to this sub (imo) is to absorb the negative energy from anti-conspiracy sentiment on reddit in general.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to think that the considerable energy spent harassing me will decrease the amount of harassment directed at others. This is more a practical development then anything &quot;noble&quot; on my part.</p>

<p>But I can definitely promise full transparency. </p>

<p>OP I appreciate your concerns, and I plan on continuing to address them!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get it, but think about if axolotl_peyotl did say yes. That would blow a lot of people&#39;s minds.</p>

<p>Ya know, if he posted that he was offered fifty thousand dollars for the ownership of this subby and posted it.</p>

<p>Then went ahead and publicly took it, I&#39;d say &quot;you go boy&quot;. At least we would know exactly what was happening. And it could be that way already.</p>

<p>Yeah let&#39;s censor this sub. People will love the shit out of that one.</p>

<p>Why is everyone so fragile these days?</p>
