    <div class="md"><p>SS:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Kammler">Hans Kammler</a> </p>

<p>This gentleman was place in control of all special weapon and rocket research shortly before disappearing at the end of the war. This included v1 and v2 rocket production which was headed up by none other than....</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun">Wernher Von Braun</a> </p>

<p>This fellow started his career as a rocket scientist in Nazi Germany at Pennemunde Facility only to be scooped up by the American government when <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip">Operation Paperclip</a>  happened at the end of the war. Next thing you know he’s with <a href="https://youtu.be/2fautyLuuvo">Micky Mouse</a> explaining to the American public how we will reach the moon using the same rocket technology that had just bombed the fuck out of London.</p>

<p>Although he was a busy man Von Braun managed to fit in some time to pass his trade along to a apprentice. A young man called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Parsons_(rocket_engineer">Jack Whiteside Parsons</a>)  appears in Pasadena California. As a aspiring rocket scientist he speaks to Von Braun over the phone and starts experimenting with solid state rocket fuel. But Von Braun wasn’t the only person that saw Parsons as an apprentice.
A man from a small town called Leamington Spa in Warwickshire England had taken a liking to Parsons. This man went by the name <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley">Aleister Crowley </a> 
He has started a religion based upon hermetic groups of the past few hundred years. He had take notes from <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry">Freemasonry </a> , <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosicrucianism">Rosicrucian groups</a> , <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati">Bavarian Illuminati </a> , <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosophy_(Blavatskian">Theosophy </a>) , <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis">Greek Mythology </a> , <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_the_Law">Egyptian Mythology </a> and collaborated them into what he called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelema">Thelema</a> .</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Cbermensch">The basic idea of Thelema is that we are as humans live in ignorance of the fact we are gods. Through a process of breaking down the programming or ego we can strip away any kind of associations we have that stop us from seeing reality as it is instead of how we perceive it.</a>   </p>

<p>This idea can be summarised as “Do what you will” with emphasis on the phrase “will”. </p>

<p>Crowley was based in the UK and Parsons was in the US so he decided to task Parsons with establishing Thelema in the US. He bought a mansion called “The Parsonage”. The Pasonage was home to a host of bohemians that rode the beginnings of what would become Charles Mansons San Francisco art house cult. Parties held at the Parsonage would descend into <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_magic">sex magik</a>  parties.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah">The general idea behind sex magik is that if you are to create an orgasm within your self or in someone else this acts as a build up of energy and if one or both people involved can focus their minds on a shared goal at the point of orgasm this brings said goal closer to manifestation.  This idea relates back to Jewish Kabbalah mysticism which is an idea that connects to the Tree of Life an basically acts an a path to enlightenment.</a>  </p>

<p>Whilst all this is happening Crowley was establishing Thelema Branches all over the world by converting different mystical lodges to Thelema.
One of these was <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternitas_Saturni">The Brotherhood of Saturn</a>  which ended up being absorbed by the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thule_Society">Thule Society </a>  which ended up turning into the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahnenerbe">Ahnenebe</a> .</p>

<p>The Thule society was basically the amalgamation of the best German occult, mystical, philosophical and political groups. 
Factually the discussed the ideas of people like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_von_List">Guido Von List</a>  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Blavatsky">Helena Blavatsky </a> , <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manly_P._Hall">Manly P Hall</a>  and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Bailey">Alice Bailey</a>  All of these individuals subscribed to the same concepts Crowley promoted in Thelema.
<a href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sumer_anunnaki/reptiles/reptiles23.htm">All of the also on the down low promoted the idea of Atlantis, Root Races and the idea that “God” is the universe and “God’s” are races that have enslaved humanity at different times.</a> </p>

<p>You can start to see a connection via trail of thought. Heinrich Himmler and Helena Blavatsky never met, but they retained a similar school of thought. This is important.</p>

<p>Meanwhile back at the Parsonage a young ex Navy officer turns up by the name of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Ron_Hubbard">L Ron Hubbard</a> . Parsons takes a liking to Hubbard and the pair start attempting a ritual that was attempted by Crowley called the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babalon_Working">Babalon Working</a> . 
It was meant to push humanity into the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Aquarius">Age of Aquarius</a> , which was supposed to be the beginning of the Book of Revelation and the begging of the end of the garden of Eden situation, our quest for knowledge of you will. Our journey to full realisation that we are divine as is everything around us.
In reality this involved Parsons and Hubbard heading out to the desert, Parsons masturbating over some stone tablets whilst Hubbard scrubbed everything that happened. A scarlet haired women was supposed to materialise and represent the Whore of Babylon.</p>

<p>The pair get home to the Parsonage and meet <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Cameron">Marjorie Cameron</a> .
A scarlet haired artist.
Parsons takes the hint and the pair start doing sex magik with Hubbard as scribe.
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Dianetics">At this point Hubbard steals $10,000 from the Parsonage buys a boat and head into the Ocean to write Dianetics, the holy book of Scientology.</a> </p>

<p><a href="https://www.classifiedufo.com/jack-parsons-jpl.html">Parsons explodes in his basement due to “chemical mixup” and Cameron claims she saw multiple UFO’s the night he died.</a> 
It’s worth mentioned that between all this chaos Parsons set up a lab called the Jack Parsons Lab. Upon his death the name was changed to “<a href="https://instagram.com/nasajpl?utm_source=ig_profile_share&amp;amp;amp;igshid=fzhv4tj8zmss">“Jet Propulsion Lab”</a> which was in turn 2 years after Parsons death absorbed into NASA which was under Von Brauns direction at the time.</p>

<p>This takes us up to the Cold War and let me tell you it gets a whole lot more complicated once Federal Government appears in the mix. We go from everything being spread out to everything being hidden as something else. What is have explained above makes the fact that every NASA mission has been named after Greek Gods a lot more intriguing.</p>

<p>Got any questions let me know.</p>

<p>I’ll try and do another one of these if people want more...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you look at the whole picture that is probably a correct assumption, Dianetics is based of Parsons work which is based off Crowley’s work which is based of John Dee’s in the 1500’s. I’d say in terms of who was pivotal I goes </p>

<p>DEE
CROWLEY 
PARSONS 
HUBBARD</p>

<p>But it’s important to remember that Hubbard took all the religious implication out of the work and made it easy for a consumer to pick the concept up of processing emotion and raising your consciousness. Hence why Scientology has become what it has become today.</p>

<p>Hubbard’s work is the easiest to understand whilst Dee’s work is v difficult to understand due to the time period and the linguistic differences of the time + what he was doing has never fully been explained but it seems to be that he was in communication with the angles from the Book of Enoch that were cast down from heaven after disobeying God and had sex with Humans and fucked up our DNA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a bit of fill in the gaps. Great post.</p>

<p>Sex magick originates in Siddha longevity practices.
Its goal unlike tantra is physical longevity, not a state of samadhi.
Jewish mysticism might of adopted it but they didn&#39;t develop it.</p>

<p>Edward Talbot ( a bit of a scoundrel ) overheard a rumour of a welsh monk being buried with &quot; the philosophers stone &quot; near an abbey. He convinced his friend John Dee to help him search for this abbey and dig up the grave. According to John Dee they found two vials, one with red liquid the other white. After they had clumsily experimented with and taken it, Dee admitted no real magick could be done without it. Edward Talbot now called Kelley set himself up as an alchemist, never having made &quot; the philosophers stone &quot; himself. John Dee stumbled his way through his experiments with the stone until a spirit called Madimi decided to teach him. Nearly everything he learnt came from her. Madimi also played with both Talbot ( Kelley ) and Dee. When she had her fun she left.
Talbots supply of the &quot; philosophers stone &quot; ran out.
Dee was left with half of the knowledge he sought.
The knowledge he had was eventually passed down, making its way through different secret societies.
The practices used by Crowley are based on Dee&#39;s incomplete and deliberately corrupted knowledge from Madimi.
Before the &quot; philosophers stone &quot; these two men were clueless.
They didn&#39;t heed the warning of previous alchemists, that those in the possession of the stone would attract forces that want to play with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you may have left out a few things...</p>

<p>As I understand it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Crowley was an intelligence asset, though an unruly one. Rumour has it his file said &quot;use only if necessary and with caution&quot; or something to that effect.</li>
<li>Hubbard was also a spy, I think OSS.</li>
<li>The Babalon working was intended to be a counter to Crowley&#39;s earlier working which was intended to bring about the age of Horus. Parsons wanted one thing, but I believe that Hubbard&#39;s goal for the working was different.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also fwiw I think Crowley was an extremely interesting man... And not quite the demon that some make him out to be. Dude was just at the bleeding edge of the counterculture of the time (a counterculture to which places like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> owe their origins).</p>

<p>Good post! </p>

<p>Except for that, this is EXACTLY what this sub should be.</p>

<p>On a funnier note, Charles Manson and L. Ron. Hubbard knew of each other if not KNEW each other from the shared LSD crowd, when Manson was asked about Scientology, he replied...</p>

<p>&quot;Maaan, HELL NO!!!! THAT SHITS CRAAAAZY STUFF!&quot;</p>

<p>If Charles fucking Manson of all people thinks you&#39;re nuts, maybe it&#39;s time to check your reality!! lmao</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For a while, yes... Iirc, he was part of the original group of hippies in the desert that later split into 3 or 4 factions, one went with L. Ron. , one group was the basis for the &quot;Family&quot;...
Which makes me wonder what happened to the other groups around there at that time??? There was a LOT of bummed out, tripped out people hanging out in the desert.</p>

<p>Viewing the Universe as God makes the most sense, and allows science and religion to work side by side. Things like karma, and sin, are just ways to control the masses. In reality there doesn&#39;t seem to be any negative effect for your actions, unless your too overt and get caught.</p>

I&#39;ve often repeated everything you wrote here, but I&#39;ve recently begun to wonder if there are any verifiable connections between Parsons, Hubbard and Crowley. I know the stories alright, but I wonder if we&#39;re just repeating somebody else&#39;s theory? </p>

<p>It might actually be David Icke who first suggested the connection in one of his books - what if he&#39;s scamming us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems fairly out in the open that Parsons was in communication with both Crowley and Von Braun at different times.</p>

<p>He spoke to Crowley via letters and Von Braun via phone and as JPL became part of NASA which Von Braun was 100% part of at the period of time we can assume they were at least aware of one another. I mean I am pretty confident Parsons developed the fuel that went inside Von Brauns rocket that put us on the moon. </p>

<p>Icke&#39;s old books mentioned all kinds of shit that&#39;s come true over the years - even the Arab spring was predicted years earlier. I wonder if the reptile crap is just a red-herring to confuse the rest</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thelema is such a wide umbrella that it covers multiple bases when looking as to what came next. </p>

<p>It covers a lot of topics that can be grouped into different political and philosophical mindsets. If we consider Von Braun and NASA right wing we can come wider Osman Spare left wing as he was an artist. Right wing occultists are all about real world manifestation and rockets fit that bill quite nicely. </p>

<p>Spare and his Zos Kia Cultis was basically the foundation for Chaos Magik and the entertainment landscape we see today. Look up Coil and The Temple of Psychik Youth and see how they tie into the Nu Metal movement at the beginning of the 2000’s via Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson. Tie this up with what was happening in film around that time, The films of David Lynch, Fight Club and other 9/11 culture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. Few things.</p>

<ol>
<li>Yes. Blink 182 are a band with some joke songs. They have 7 albums. 6 of which DeLonge played on. Each of these albums have a minimum of 12 songs. That’s at least 72 songs. Blink have 5 complete joke songs.</li>
</ol>

<p>1.Fuck a Dog
2.When you fucked Grandpa
3.Family Reunion 
4.Mothers Day
5.Happy Holidays you Bastard</p>

<p>I’ll give you the whole Cheshire Cat album if you really wanna debate but you’ve gotta give me the Dogs eating Dogs EP which has 0 joke songs.</p>

<p>What I am saying is a v small percentage of blinks discography was FUCK FUCK SHIT FUCK and actively past a certain era they were trying to move away from this aesthetic as it was hindering their artistic vision. This is literally the reason they are split up right now. Mark thinks it is safe to re hash old themes and stay true to what he thinks Blink is whilst Tom regrets the silly ways of the past and should like to move on the more philosophical topic of the youth instead of specific events of debauchery like in older songs.
There are so many <a href="https://youtu.be/7GgoqG9LKDI">interviews </a>  of Tom explains how his old songs got him in trouble and how he now sees how they were just kids laughing at stupid things.
One of Tom’s new songs “New World” pretty much spells this out is</p>

<p>“It violates and blinds the eyes
But I found a new world”</p>

<p>He’s explaining why Blink can’t be like it used to be.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I don’t know what your getting at by saying he doesn’t write his own music. He always wrote with Mark but there’s so many songs he wrote on his own for Blink Ava and his own solo endeavour and that’s not even considering Box Car Racer.</p></li>
<li><p>He has a unconventional singing style I’ll give you that, his riffs are pretty badass though. You couldn’t/haven’t wrote a Delong tier riff. Song writing is where he shines.</p></li>
<li><p>A lot of people’s family are in the military mine included what’s your point.</p></li>
<li><p>He literally wrote a song with Blink 182 in 1999 called “Aliens exist” then 15 years later left the same band for the exact reason that aliens exist. It seems if anything Blink 182 was the change of heart pulling him away from aliens studies.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I’m sorry I didn’t wanna talk to you like this but what your saying simply isn’t truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True but if you search for Tom Delonge father nothing comes up at all. And what i can find is he was an oil company executive. Silver spoon? Im sorry but i can&#39;t take anyone seriously that thinks he&#39;s a good musician. I&#39;ve had people try to tell me nickelback riffs are good too. Not buying it. Punk rock music from this era is among the most simple to play and there&#39;s reasons why green day suddenly came back to cash in.  There&#39;s tons of evidence on the internet of Tom sucking at guitar live. Your extensive knowledge of blink 182 and opinion of Tom shows your bias, IMO. </p>

<p>There&#39;s lots of evidence out there some music is used as a tool by intelligence agencies domestic and abroad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fuck are you on about?</p>

<p>Nickelback objectivity do have good riffs. Have you written a song like Animals, Flat on the Floor or How You Remind Me? </p>

<p>You might not like them but millions of people do! Are we to say every single person that likes Nickelback is a delinquent? That doesn’t seem incredibly level headed.</p>

<p>You seem to know more about Toms dad than I do since all I have ever heard about him is that he left Toms mom and the family relatively early on in Toms life. 
Interesting tidbit is that Mark Hoppus (the bass player and other singer from Blink for those who do not know) had a grandfather??? In WW2 which is whose letters are being read out in the interlude between the songs Violence and Stockholm Syndrome on their Untitled record for those Blinl fans that are listening.</p>

<p>When Tom finally got his first “big” paycheck he contacted Dr Steven Greer this was in 2001/2002 and back when he was doing the Disclosure Project (aka the credible section of his work). Greer came out to meet Tom on tour and upon meeting Mark Hoppus somehow managed to contact??? the same grandfather that had been in the war through some sort of meditation channeling experience.</p>

<p>I don’t write the stories I just tell them.</p>

<p>Your Green Day point is not great either, I mean it’s not hard to see that when they recorded Dookie that’s the life they were loving.</p>

<p>Weed, Girls, skulking around the streets at night and panic attacks. Everyone’s early 20’s basically.</p>

<p>Follow Insomniac, Nimrod, Warning and they are all kind of autobiographical. Warning flopped and Green day took a step back from writing and tour from 1999-2002.</p>

<p>Listen to American Idiot and they are talking about the same shit they were talking about on Dookie but from a outsider philosophical point of view. Because they have lived it they can speak upon it kind of thing. 
I do believe the guys in Green Day are genuine if not a little insecure. Same as Blink. Same as most people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol the nickelback defense says all i need to hear.  I do agree with essentially everything you&#39;ve said outside of Tom and the music industry. Just because it&#39;s popular doesn&#39;t mean anything. Justin Bieber had the number 1 video on youtube ever. Does that mean Despacito is better than all other music? Surely you know of the corruption in the music industry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is old school conspiracy stuff. I like it. You should listen to Terence McKenna talk about how Descartes got his ideas from having hallucinations and tripping balls.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/René_Descartes</a></p>

<p>“According to Adrien Baillet, on the night of 10–11 November 1619 (St. Martin&#39;s Day), while stationed in Neuburg an der Donau, Descartes shut himself in a room with an &quot;oven&quot; (probably a Kachelofen or masonry heater) to escape the cold. While within, he had three dreams[31] and believed that a divine spirit revealed to him a new philosophy. However, it is likely that what Descartes considered to be his second dream was actually an episode of exploding head syndrome.[32] Upon exiting, he had formulated analytical geometry and the idea of applying the mathematical method to philosophy. He concluded from these visions that the pursuit of science would prove to be, for him, the pursuit of true wisdom and a central part of his life&#39;s work.[33][34] Descartes also saw very clearly that all truths were linked with one another so that finding a fundamental truth and proceeding with logic would open the way to all science. Descartes discovered this basic truth quite soon: his famous &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;.[28]”</p>

<p>I think this is the talk where McKenna briefly talks about Descartes. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/pDrn-uL2EwU">https://youtu.be/pDrn-uL2EwU</a></p>

<p>Really though I think what essentially is going on here is that wise religious people like Crowley are leading people like Von Bruan into a spiritual path that reveals truth in a way that is as yet unknown. I highly suspect this is either dormant brain power, or it is collective unconscious that Jung talked about, hence as you said the reuse of names of Greek gods for names of NASA missions. These are naturally arising reuse of the same archetypical stories that mankind has always told. But perhaps the “revealed knowledge” is something more? I don’t know.</p>

<p>Now, the caveat to this is that Crowley was of course known for his debauchery. And from what I’ve read about him, he died with regrets from not really knowing his son. So, how wise and enlightened was he? Was he simply knowledgeable enough to lead Von Bruan?</p>

<p>One last theory, that has nothing to do with Descartes or Jung but everything to do with McKenna and maybe Crowley is the use of mushrooms. McKenna believes that mushrooms are an otherworldly intelligence all their own and observe the world and tell their secrets to the people who ingest them. So, maybe the mushrooms were talking to Von Bruan. There is another note here, there are receptors in the human body that only get activated by ingesting mushrooms (not necessarily hallucinogenic, although McKenna believes that hallucinogens are part of the reason why humans have evolved as far as we have), so humans evidentially were meant to be eating mushrooms all this time.</p>

<p>None of that precludes wisdom or enlightenment. </p>

<p>Now, what&#39;s the case for him actually being wise or enlightened in the first place?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do love this sort of stuff, but you&#39;re glossing over some of the connections between this whole set and the US government. You said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s worth mentioned that between all this chaos Parsons set up a lab  called the Jack Parsons Lab. Upon his death the name was changed to “<a href="https://instagram.com/nasajpl?utm_source=ig_profile_share&amp;amp;igshid=fzhv4tj8zmss">“Jet Propulsion Lab”</a> which was in turn 2 years after Parsons death absorbed into NASA which was under Von Brauns direction at the time. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Parsons and his cohort were kicking around with rockets from the 1930&#39;s and were continually trying to win contracts and bids from the US government, who could not give less of a shit about any of their work. It was only when people became aware of the military applications during the Second World War that they were given a chance, and even then they were continually pissed off by the stupidity, corruption, and backwardness of the government guys they interacted with. And it was only in the mid 1950&#39;s that things began to pick up. </p>

<p>I really doubt that any serious esoteric influence was able to penetrate through the apathy and enter into government doctrine. There was an almost lack of interest in the entire area for nearly 20 years, and there&#39;s no way this could change so quickly.</p>
