        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why would a guy as cunning as Cody, who actually picks fights with the US govt, leave an evidence trail a mile wide in flashing orange, in cleartext on a public website to a crime that would assassinate his character and ruin him when he knows he&#39;s under investigation by the state?   </p>

<p>He absolutely knew he would get caught, there&#39;s no way he could think otherwise.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>He gave up his identity on the website in cleartext and pictures.   <strong>A guy who calls himself a cryptoanarchist didn&#39;t even transition the criminal conversation to a simple encrypted chat app like Whatsapp or Signal or Wickr.</strong>  </p></li>
<li><p>He used the same username he is suspected to have used 5 years previously, Sanjuro.   Whoever was at the other end of that conversation was very diligent with their encryption and used Tor.   Using the same name on a cleartext public prostitution site would be unbelievably bad opsec.</p></li>
<li><p>He used a DD car when he could&#39;ve used any car, rented a car, used a cab or a rideshare.  Very convenient for the US govt since now his company is implicated and they have a nice neat excuse to dig through all of their records and seize any evidence they care to.</p></li>
<li><p>He got caught on camera when he could&#39;ve easily hidden his face with a hoodie or a hat.  He could&#39;ve scoped out a motel with no camera, plenty of those in Austin.  Not hard to find at all.</p></li>
<li><p>He could&#39;ve picked up a hooker on the street or an escort in a high-end bar just as easily and leave absolutely no datatrail.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>He could&#39;ve flown to Nevada and done this all legally for a few hundred on a plane ticket and a few hours on a plane.</strong>   Seems worthwhile when you&#39;re an enemy of the state under govt surveillance don&#39;t you think?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Did Cody strike you as an idiot? Impulsive? Or was he calculating and cold? Every time someone described him it was always as intelligent, cold, even sociopathic from some people.   Never an idiot, never wacky and chaotic.  Always calm and controlled.</p>

<p>There&#39;s absolutely no way he didn&#39;t do this deliberately. Which begs the question, why did he do it?</p>

<p>Did he crack under the pressure?  Maybe.</p>

<p>Consider this.  What if he was coerced?  If I was an agent tasked to remove Cody Wilson... I would threaten his family, ensure that he knew our capabilities, then say he can save them. All he has to do is follow my instructions. </p>

<p><strong>It&#39;s much more effective to assassinate his character than to actually assassinate him</strong> and turn him into a martyr.   Now he&#39;s an anti-martyr, just another borderline pedo in the libertarian community.   Another nutjob.  Another pervert.</p>

<p><strong>The narrative is everything.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>(Just running off memory here)  Recently there were a bunch of headlines about government restricting 3D gun printing, quite a bit of hoopla about it in the media, this guy was in the running with Tesla for top page speculatory gossip, and now ..... he&#39;s being hit with a slew of unconnected personal sex crime accusations.</p>

<p>Sex crime allegations do seem to be the flavor-of-the-day for taking down unwanted headliners; unwanted for any number of reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most interesting facts being reported are:
1: the girl went to a school counselor days after to report the event 
2: one of the girl’s friends allegedly tipped Wilson off to the incident being reported to the police
3: Wilson drove the girl all the way across the city after the hotel after paying her $500 in order to drop her off</p>

<p>The first fact is important because the timeframe appears to eliminate any and all possibility for DNA to be collected or the ‘crime scene’ to be investigated for evidence. There also does not appear to be any onus for why she would report the incident. </p>

<p>The second fact is bizarre in that the friend would be able to reach Wilson and that he would believe the statement of a random girl he’s never met. If the girl intentionally reported Wilson, her friend is also essentially stabbing her in the back to protect Wilson for no discernible reason. </p>

<p>The third fact is the most intriguing to me. Who has ever heard of someone paying a prostitute, especially $500/hr, and then personally driving them at least 20-30 minutes to drop them off on the other side of town?</p>

<p>This may be crazy but this whole thing looks like Wilson could have conceivably set it up to frame the government. I wouldn’t be surprised if we eventually see a tape of them in the hotel room with multiple witnesses doing nothing for 45 minutes and then leaving to set the event in motion. However, maybe people really can have that big of a lapse in judgement when horny but as soon as I heard the news about this I immediately thought of the movie, The Life of David Gale. Coincidentally, the movie also takes place in Austin. It would be very interesting to find out if Wilson saw that movie recently. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Life of David Gale came out in 2003 so not quite 20 years yet. Brief summary is an anti-death penalty activist and his colleague who has cancer plan her suicide to look like rape and murder and film the whole thing. He’s wrongfully convicted, sentenced to death, and executed. The media receives the tape in the mail just as it’s too late to stop the execution. Starring Kevin Spacey. </p>

<p>I have heard stories of police making kids drop their pants to compare sexts with IRL dicks to catch someone. There was tons of backlash.

    <div class="md"><p>Nowadays sex crime allegations against people who are actually effective against the left and are pro-freedom are like sprinkling crack on black people after shooting them. I hate to bring up Brett Kavanaugh since that dead horse has already been beat to death twice, but he&#39;s the obvious example. Whether he did it or not, you&#39;d have to be extremely sheepish to not be suspicious of how convenient it all is. Even if you&#39;re like me and assume nearly every politician is guilty of some kind of sexual assault, the question remains: how long did they know about it, and do they store the info solely to attack them if they decide to engage in efforts to lessen federal power?</p>

<p>The answer is clearly yes to both of these.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying automatically that he didn&#39;t do it. I&#39;m saying that the legal system and media are being weaponized solely to make hit pieces more effective. If this doesn&#39;t blurt out that there&#39;s a larger conspiracy against enemies of the state who campaign for freedom, especially with the historical precedent, then you&#39;re deaf.</p>
