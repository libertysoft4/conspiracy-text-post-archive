<blockquote>
<p>Bags of cash delivered to a Rome hotel for favored Italian candidates. Scandalous stories leaked to foreign newspapers to swing an election in Nicaragua. Millions of pamphlets, posters and stickers printed to defeat an incumbent in Serbia.</p>

<p>The long arm of Vladimir Putin? No, just a small sample of the United States’ history of intervention in foreign elections.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, American intelligence chiefs warned the Senate Intelligence Committee that Russia appears to be preparing to repeat in the 2018 midterm elections the same full-on chicanery it unleashed in 2016: hacking, leaking, social media manipulation and possibly more. Then on Friday, Robert Mueller, the special counsel, announced the indictments of 13 Russians and three companies, run by a businessman with close Kremlin ties, laying out in astonishing detail a three-year scheme to use social media to attack Hillary Clinton, boost Donald Trump and sow discord.</p>

<p>Most Americans are understandably shocked by what they view as an unprecedented attack on our political system. But intelligence veterans, and scholars who have studied covert operations, have a different, and quite revealing, view.</p>

<p>“If you ask an intelligence officer, did the Russians break the rules or do something bizarre, the answer is no, not at all,” said Steven L. Hall, who retired in 2015 after 30 years at the C.I.A., where he was the chief of Russian operations. The United States “absolutely” has carried out such election influence operations historically, he said, “and I hope we keep doing it.”</p>

<p>Loch K. Johnson, the dean of American intelligence scholars, who began his career in the 1970s investigating the C.I.A. as a staff member of the Senate’s Church Committee, says Russia’s 2016 operation was simply the cyber-age version of standard United States practice for decades, whenever American officials were worried about a foreign vote.</p>

<p>“We’ve been doing this kind of thing since the C.I.A. was created in 1947,” said Mr. Johnson, now at the University of Georgia. “We’ve used posters, pamphlets, mailers, banners — you name it. We’ve planted false information in foreign newspapers. We’ve used what the British call ‘King George’s cavalry’: suitcases of cash.”</p>

<p>The United States’ departure from democratic ideals sometimes went much further. The C.I.A. helped overthrow elected leaders in Iran and Guatemala in the 1950s and backed violent coups in several other countries in the 1960s. It plotted assassinations and supported brutal anti-Communist governments in Latin America, Africa and Asia.</p>

<p>But in recent decades, both Mr. Hall and Mr. Johnson argued, Russian and American interferences in elections have not been morally equivalent. American interventions have generally been aimed at helping non-authoritarian candidates challenge dictators or otherwise promoting democracy. Russia has more often intervened to disrupt democracy or promote authoritarian rule, they said.</p>

<p>Equating the two, Mr. Hall says, “is like saying cops and bad guys are the same because they both have guns — the motivation matters.”</p>

<p>This broader history of election meddling has largely been missing from the flood of reporting on the Russian intervention and the investigation of whether the Trump campaign was involved. It is a reminder that the Russian campaign in 2016 was fundamentally old-school espionage, even if it exploited new technologies. And it illuminates the larger currents of history that drove American electoral interventions during the Cold War and motivate Russia’s actions today.</p>

<p>A Carnegie Mellon scholar, Dov H. Levin, has scoured the historical record for both overt and covert election influence operations. He found 81 by the United States and 36 by the Soviet Union or Russia between 1946 and 2000, though the Russian count is undoubtedly incomplete.</p>

<p>“I’m not in any way justifying what the Russians did in 2016,” Mr. Levin said. “It was completely wrong of Vladimir Putin to intervene in this way. That said, the methods they used in this election were the digital version of methods used both by the United States and Russia for decades: breaking into party headquarters, recruiting secretaries, placing informants in a party, giving information or disinformation to newspapers.”</p>

<p>His findings underscore how routine election meddling by the United States — sometimes covert and sometimes quite open — has been.</p>

<p>The precedent was established in Italy with assistance to non-Communist candidates from the late 1940s to the 1960s. “We had bags of money that we delivered to selected politicians, to defray their expenses,” said F. Mark Wyatt, a former C.I.A. officer, in a 1996 interview.</p>

<p>Covert propaganda has also been a mainstay. Richard M. Bissell Jr., who ran the agency’s operations in the late 1950s and early 1960s, wrote casually in his autobiography of “exercising control over a newspaper or broadcasting station, or of securing the desired outcome in an election.” A self-congratulatory declassified report on the C.I.A.’s work in Chile’s 1964 election boasts of the “hard work” the agency did supplying “large sums” to its favored candidate and portraying him as a “wise, sincere and high-minded statesman” while painting his leftist opponent as a “calculating schemer.”</p>

<p>C.I.A. officials told Mr. Johnson in the late 1980s that “insertions” of information into foreign news media, mostly accurate but sometimes false, were running at 70 to 80 a day. In the 1990 election in Nicaragua, the C.I.A. planted stories about corruption in the leftist Sandinista government, Mr. Levin said. The opposition won.</p>

<p>Over time, more American influence operations have been mounted not secretly by the C.I.A. but openly by the State Department and its affiliates. For the 2000 election in Serbia, the United States funded a successful effort to defeat Slobodan Milosevic, the nationalist leader, providing political consultants and millions of stickers with the opposition’s clenched-fist symbol and “He’s finished” in Serbian, printed on 80 tons of adhesive paper and delivered by a Washington contractor.</p>

<p>Vince Houghton, who served in the military in the Balkans at the time and worked closely with the intelligence agencies, said he saw American efforts everywhere. “We made it very clear that we had no intention of letting Milosevic stay in power,” said Mr. Houghton, now the historian at the International Spy Museum.</p>

<p>Similar efforts were undertaken in elections in wartime Iraq and Afghanistan, not always with success. After Hamid Karzai was re-elected president of Afghanistan in 2009, he complained to Robert Gates, then the secretary of defense, about the United States’ blatant attempt to defeat him, which Mr. Gates calls in his memoir “our clumsy and failed putsch.”</p>

<p>At least once the hand of the United States reached boldly into a Russian election. American fears that Boris Yeltsin would be defeated for re-election as president in 1996 by an old-fashioned Communist led to an overt and covert effort to help him, urged on by President Bill Clinton. It included an American push for a $10 billion International Monetary Fund loan to Russia four months before the voting and a team of American political consultants (though some Russians scoffed when they took credit for the Yeltsin win).</p>

<p>That heavy-handed intervention made some Americans uneasy. Thomas Carothers, a scholar at the Carnegie Institute for International Peace, recalls arguing with a State Department official who told him at the time, “Yeltsin is democracy in Russia,” to which Mr. Carothers said he replied, “That’s not what democracy means.”</p>

<p>But what does democracy mean? Can it include secretly undermining an authoritarian ruler or helping challengers who embrace democratic values? How about financing civic organizations?</p>

<p>In recent decades, the most visible American presence in foreign politics has been taxpayer-funded groups like the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute, which do not support candidates but teach basic campaign skills, build democratic institutions and train election monitors.</p>

<p>Most Americans view such efforts as benign — indeed, charitable. But Mr. Putin sees them as hostile. The National Endowment for Democracy gave a $23,000 grant in 2006 to an organization that employed Aleksei Navalny, who years later became Mr. Putin’s main political nemesis, a fact the government has used to attack both Mr. Navalny and the endowment. In 2016, the endowment gave 108 grants totaling $6.8 million to organizations in Russia for such purposes as “engaging activists” and “fostering civic engagement.” The endowment no longer names Russian recipients, who, under Russian laws cracking down on foreign funding, can face harassment or arrest.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand why Mr. Putin sees such American cash as a threat to his rule, which tolerates no real opposition. But American veterans of democracy promotion find abhorrent Mr. Putin’s insinuations that their work is equivalent to what the Russian government is accused of doing in the United States today.</p>

<p>“It’s not just apples and oranges,” said Kenneth Wollack, president of the National Democratic Institute. “It’s comparing someone who delivers lifesaving medicine to someone who brings deadly poison.”</p>

<p>What the C.I.A. may have done in recent years to steer foreign elections is still secret and may not be known for decades. It may be modest by comparison with the agency’s Cold War manipulation. But some old-timers aren’t so sure.</p>

<p>“I assume they’re doing a lot of the old stuff, because, you know, it never changes,” said William J. Daugherty, who worked for the C.I.A. from 1979 to 1996 and at one time had the job of reviewing covert operations. “The technology may change, but the objectives don’t.”</p>

<p>Correction: February 18, 2018
An earlier version of this article stated incorrectly that Aleksei Navalny, a political opponent of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, had received grants from the National Endowment for Democracy. In fact, an organization employing him received one $23,000 grant from the endowment in 2006.</p>

<p>The problem is how do you create a system in which everyone NOT being able to vote, is somehow being represented and not corrupted to suppress people. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of room for malicious manipulation in a system like that. </p>

<p>As we can already see from just plain old senators and congressman. </p>

<p>With my position being well known, I actually kind of enjoy the blue team&#39;s hate of Russia right now. Russia&#39;s government is pretty fucking shitty, so it&#39;s always nice to sling turds their way. </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t like people thinking Trump was elected because of their memes and fakenews. Trump is IMMENSELY popular. I&#39;m in rural GA, and everyone has bumper stickers, signs, hats, tshirts. I mean everyone in the rural us loves Trump, and it&#39;s not because they&#39;re all pizzagate qanons (no offense to anyone). These people barely use the internet. </p>

<p>I know what your talking points are gonna be at this point, so I&#39;ll get them out of the way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>LOOK AT ALL THOSE INDICTMENTS!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Process crimes and financial corruption, nothing to do with collusion. Color me surprised.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TRUMP JR.!11!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meeting was organized by Fusion GPS, and Veselnitskaya was there to screen a documentary made by Nekrasov, a vocal anti-Putin journalist and producer, on the Magnitsky Act (which showed that Browder was a lying piece of shit). No evidence that the Kremlin had any involvement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TROLL FARM!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Outed in 2015 by Adrian Chen, and it was directed largely at Russians. Most of the tweets were never seen, and they posted from  &quot;legitimate&quot; sources like WaPo for all sides. No evidence of Kremlin involvement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>RUSSIAN OFFICERS!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like the above troll farm indictments, no evidence will ever be given to support this. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>DNC HACK!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only &quot;evidence&quot; supporting it is a cherry picked NSA assessment (not a report, and it has a disclaimer as well), and CrowdStrike (affiliated with the Atlantic Council). According to Bill Binney, this violates chain of custody, therefore making it invalid.</p>

<p>If someone gets 10 years in prison for shoplifting after a different person got 30 days in jail for shoplifting, it&#39;s not <em>whataboutism</em> to point that out.</p>

<p>Nice intro summary for people who haven&#39;t read this wiki before:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>United States involvement in regime change has entailed both overt and covert actions aimed at altering, replacing, or preserving foreign governments. In the latter half of the 19th century, the U.S. government initiated actions for regime change mainly in Latin America and the southwest Pacific, and included the Mexican–American, Spanish–American and Philippine–American wars. At the onset of the 20th century the United States shaped or installed friendly governments in many countries including Panama, Honduras, Nicaragua, Mexico, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of World War II, the U.S. government expanded the geographic scope of its actions to foster regime change, as the country struggled with the Soviet Union for global leadership and influence within the context of the Cold War. Significant operations included the U.S. and UK-orchestrated 1953 Iranian coup d&#39;état, the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion targeting Cuba, the anti-communist purge in Indonesia, and support for the Argentinian Dirty War, in addition to the U.S.&#39;s traditional area of operations, Central America and the Caribbean. In addition, the U.S. has interfered in the national elections of many countries, including in Japan in the 1950s and 1960s to keep its preferred center-right Liberal Democratic Party in power using secret funds, in the Philippines to orchestrate the campaign of Ramon Magsaysay for president in 1953, and in Lebanon to help Christian parties in the 1957 elections using secret cash infusions.[1] The U.S. has executed at least 81 overt and covert known interventions in foreign elections during the period 1946–2000.[2]</p>

<p>Also after World War II, the United States in 1945 ratified[3] the UN Charter, the preeminent international law document,[4] which legally bound the U.S. government to the Charter&#39;s provisions, including Article 2(4), which prohibits the threat or use of force in international relations, except in very limited circumstances.[5] Therefore, any legal claim advanced to justify regime change by a foreign power carries a particularly heavy burden.[6]</p>

<p>Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United States has led or supported wars to determine the governance of a number of countries. Stated U.S. aims in these conflicts have included fighting the War on Terror as in the 2001 Afghan war, or removing dictatorial and hostile regimes in the 2003 Iraq War and 2011 military intervention in Libya.</p>

<p>Russia is an outlier. Most nations do not interfere with other nations elections. That doesn&#39;t mean that there aren&#39;t other offenders or that the US isn&#39;t one of them (both of which are also true).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to begin by defining the thing that offends you.</p>

<p>Is meddling in a foreign election always wrong for everyone <em>no matter what</em>?</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>Is meddling acceptable when acting against a bad government/candidate for the best interest of the people of that country?</p>

<p>If you want to make the argument that 100% of the time (even if it was to stop the election of Hitler) it would be wrong to meddle in a foreign election, then that&#39;s fine.   But I doubt most people believe that.</p>

<p>If you believe it&#39;s okay depending on who is having their election meddled with, then we have to start discussing what specifically Russia did, what potentially was diverted by avoiding a Hilary presidency, and if it benefited the US population as well as Russia.</p>

<p>Because what I can say is 2 things.</p>

<p>1) The information from DNC email hacking has still not been refuted.  The biggest impact Russia had was to release <em>Accurate</em> information from within the DNC.</p>

<p>2) The United States is not measurably worse in any quantifiable way as a result of this election and <em>more importantly</em> nobody can point to something Russia has gained either since the election.</p>

<p>The left, reddit, MSM, all act like Hilary would be a &quot;normal&quot; president and by helping Trump get elected Russia got a more friendly president.  <em>But what if the whole metric were shifted.
What if Hilary would have been a &quot;aggressive and confrontational&quot; president and by helping Trump get elected Russia got a &quot;normal&quot; president?</em></p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That depends on how you define meddling. I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s wrong to try to subvert an authoritarian government&#39;s control over elections. The US has done that from time to time, but we&#39;ve also toppled democratically elected leaders, financed insurgencies against democratically elected governments, etc. The US does not have clean hands when it comes to free and fair elections. Not at all!</p>

<p>That being said, at a very high level, any external influence in an otherwise free and fair election should be seen as a hostile act, certainly. It is a direct attack (and I mean that very specifically) on sovereignty when it comes to democracy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The biggest impact Russia had was to release Accurate information...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whether the information that Russia released was accurate or not has nothing to do with any question of whether or not their actions constituted a hostile act against the sovereignty of the United States.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The United States is not measurably worse in any quantifiable way as a result of this election</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What universe do you live in?! Pretty much everything uncovered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Counsel_investigation_(2017%E2%80%93present)">the special counsel&#39;s investigation</a> has been horrifically destructive to the Office of the President, its authority and credibility, probably for decades to come. It got us a president who is actively subverting the ongoing capacities of the FBI and intelligence services both in terms of the precedents for how the executive interacts with active investigations and in terms of the outing of sources and methods used in investigations. It got us a much more polarized and intransigent government. It alienated us from many of our allies. It lead to the portrayal of the US, internationally as anti-intellectual and uninformed. It may well end up leading to the stacking of a US Supreme Court in favor of presidential power on a scale that the US has been strongly opposed to since its founding. It has lead to the first time the president has been an unindicted co-conspirator in a criminal investigation since Nixon!</p>

<p>How do you even begin to make such a claim?!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know what a &quot;normal&quot; president is anymore, but certainly, she would not have been tweeting insults at random celebrities and taking advice on how to run the country from entertainment show hosts... She would not have stoked the fires of racism, engaged in a trade war with no end-game, alienated our allies, eroded the standing of the office and the nation, or had several of her staff indicted and convicted of serious crimes.</p>

<p>So, is that &quot;normal&quot; now? Ugh, if so that&#39;s terrible commentary.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an Enlightenment concept that was introduced by Locke, but codified in the Declaration of Independence of the United States. To paraphrase: the divine right of rule that was the guiding principle of the feudal period governance was rejected during the Enlightenment in favor of the notion that that authority was always the people&#39;s to give or exercise as they see fit.</p>

<p>When the people&#39;s voice is being subverted, I&#39;m definitely in favor of doing something to assist in the return of that power to the people, but to say that either the US or Russia have held to that principle would be absurdly contrary to the facts.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re touching on the difference between majority rule and the recognition of universal rights... also an Enlightenment principle which was considered horrifyingly wrongheaded during the feudal period. I agree that that&#39;s a very difficult line to maintain.</p>

Russian propaganda being used to influence our 2016 election is fairly well established at this point.  Obama passed the countering disinformation act in 2016 and directly cited Russia in that act.  He should have taken this seriously in 2012 when he scoffed at Romney and other Republicans when they named Russia as our greatest geopolitical enemy.  Republicans didnt just come up with this from thin air.  Russia had been tampering with elections in their region and the threat was correctly identified by our intelligence agencies in the years leading up to 2012.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>bullshit. there’s mountains of evidence of their propaganda campaigns at work, both in far right and far left circles. Paul Manafort has used the same exact tactics and slogans for the trump v hillary race that he used in the yanukovych v Tymoshenko race, also then working on behalf of the much more blatantly kremlin-backed yanukovych. We know for a fact of their bot campaigns that are still now active across facebook, twitter, reddit, youtube and more. Even disregarding the propaganda campaigns (as if you can possibly deny their direct connections to the kremlin and huge impact on how america voted) Countless states use electronic voting systems that are outdated and demonstrated time and time again to be easily hacked. In states trump “won”, such as my home state of georgia which is already hopelessly gerrymandered in favor of republicans, there are reports of breaches of voter data by the russians. Of course the republicans who benefit from such interference have blocked any efforts to release reports on such data, and refuse to take measures to increase voter security. </p>

<p>There is massive circumstantial evidence that the russians are interfering still with our electoral process just enough to keep republicans in majority power against the will of the people.</p>

<p>Yes, america has done these same things. yes clinton was involved in this. but pardon me in saying as an american that i would rather be able to know my vote is worth a damn and not compromised by a FOREIGN KLEPTOCRATIC REGIME. </p>

<p>Moreover, this level of interference is pretty small compared to what already happens in our elections. I&#39;d love to see an official intel report breaking down all attempted interference in our election by foreign governments. I&#39;d be suprised if Russia cracks to the top 5.</p>

<p>More likely you&#39;d see Israel at the top. Then the Chinese. Then the Saudis. The French do a lot of espionage too, and don&#39;t forget the Brits.</p>

<p>This is the wrong way to look at it. The Russians aren&#39;t pro-Republican exclusively. They were adamantly anti-Clinton, but they&#39;re more interested in disruption than any party. They want to see the EU and Nato broken up and the major Western powers politically crippled. In that environment, they see the most positive outcomes for Russian economic, territorial and ideological expansion.</p>

<p>It does say they haven’t found evidence of files being edited on votes. Like they didn’t physically change which votes went to who. </p>

<p>It is possible that they edited voter profiles and registrations that may have changed the outcome of the election (no states except Illinois have really even acknowledged that they were breached which I believe is to protect voter confidence) </p>

<p>This may not be enough evidence for you, I suggest you look up the topic more on your own since you shouldn’t trust sources being provided by a potentially biased party, it is enough evidence for me and along with the influence and misinformation campaigns to suspect foul play </p>

<p>You see, normally the crime already exists and then they investigate to discover the motive.  (ie.  Russia hacked the election...lets find out why?  We discover they have motive on trump).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually think the fact that the US meddled with Russia&#39;s 1996 election is a pretty good argument that Russia meddled in our 2016 election. It was payback, especially since we are talking about Bill Clinton doing the meddling back then. As my mother always told me, two wrongs don&#39;t make a right, which means that Russia should not have meddled, even if they wanted revenge. </p>

<p>In other words, rather than say &quot;fair is fair,&quot; I would ask why someone would think Russia <em>did not</em> meddle, because there are still a lot of people who question it. Why would Russia miss the opportunity to screw over Bill Clinton&#39;s wife after what he did in 1996? They clearly had the motivation, and since they meddled, I think it&#39;s silly that they held a 20 year grudge against Bill Clinton. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1996, with the presidency of Boris Yeltsin and the Russian economy flailing, President Clinton endorsed a $10.2-billion loan from the International Monetary Fund linked to privatization, trade liberalization and other measures that would move Russia toward a capitalist economy. Yeltsin used the loan to bolster his popular support, telling voters that only he had the reformist credentials to secure such loans, according to media reports at the time. He used the money, in part, for social spending before the election, including payment of back wages and pensions.</p>

<p>The U.S. has a long history of attempting to influence presidential elections in other countries – it&#39;s done so as many as 81 times between 1946 and 2000, according to a database amassed by political scientist Dov Levin of Carnegie Mellon University.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We, Clinton and I, would go through it and Bill would pick up the hotline and talk to Yeltsin and tell him what commercials to run, where to campaign, what positions to take. He basically became Yeltsin’s political consultant.</p>

<p>“I think that Putin resented that, hated it, thought that it was an inappropriate intervention by Bill Clinton and I think he’s determined to take his revenge out on Hillary Clinton.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or possibly both right, at least theoretically.</p>

<p>The point is that anyone that argues (which I&#39;m not) that the US had undermined other governments for the best interests of the citizens of that country, should at least theoretically admit the possibility that someone could eventually return the favor, that the roles would be reversed.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not disagreeing with you that it&#39;s &quot;always wrong&quot;, but my point is that if someone says it&#39;s sometimes right, then they have to concede that it could be right for someone to do it to US eventually.</p>

We just need to be educated enough to distiguish what is BS and what is not.

<p>Is this really such a hard thing to say ? So many people are either Russian shills or just don&#39;t want to admit that perhaps the president , or many others , benefited from this , but we shouldn&#39;t care because we fuck up countries all the time .</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want ANYONE fucking up ANY elections in a free world . Democracy , and the voice of the people , should be a thing world wide , and none of us should be affecting the growth and progress of ANY countries . Yeah we&#39;re just as bad , if not miles worse than Russia .  We should stop our shit too , and on top of that seriously discuss with ourselves about what the fuck exactly happened with Russia meddling. Who exactly were they trying to help ,  if anyone ? What was their main goal ? Rather than pussy foot around the issue and argue over us being shit bags in the past , why not just focus on the present day and try and recover from us getting fucked ? </p>

<p>If we can even begin to hope to reprimand the imperialists and warmongers in our country , then we first have to acknowledge what helped them in the first place ,  and then to figure out how to prevent this from happening any further . Once we can secure our own electoral process , we can finally begin to get people into power who WILL make amends for the world . </p>

<p>Us common citizens arguing over our imperialism for the past 50/60 years , while people in power are making us poorer and less educated,  will get us nowhere . If we focus on securing our elections , and removing the shits in power who should not be there , then we as a country can start getting into a comfortable place where we can discuss and handle our disgusting choices . </p>

<p>But instead , everyone would rather just bitch about the past ,  and focus on things that have come and gone , in order to say that we shouldn&#39;t care at all that Russia fucked with us and helped get garbage people into power .</p>

<p>If you are on a ship , and someone paid the captain to direct the ship towards an iceberg,  you attempt to get the morons driving the ship to change course or step away from the wheel . You don&#39;t all begin to remember all the times your crew did that to other crews , and come to the conclusion that what&#39;s happening is just how things should be . </p>

Foreign actors and regimes that fund and supply non-state actors and terrorist cells that wreak havoc and destruction on our and our allies soil deserve to face the justice of their victims. Furthermore, alliances like NATO, the UKUSA agreement, and even Five Eyes stand for the ideal that the cooperating nations more or less see eye-to-eye and will work together to extinguish foreign terror, tyrants, and human rights violators. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are clearly unfamiliar with the American judicial system. The wheels of justice may turn slowly, but they do not stop. The case against trump is larger than widely reported. While most demand impeachment, Mueller is building a classic Organized Crime case. He started with Manafort, then got the lower level guys, and now he’s flipped Manafort and Cohen is assisting to a certain degree. The case against Trump is a collaborative effort to bring down a Transnational Organized Crime Syndicate. Trump is a traitor and he will face justice for that, but he is not the worst of it, and the Justice Department is going after the Boss, not his orange lackey</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia does this for the same reason the US does; to expand geopolitical influence to benefit of the country. It is in Russia&#39;s best interest to have a weakend and infighting NATO/US/Western countries. I would say between the current US political climate and Brexit they are doing a pretty good job. This is why I fail to understand people that either defend this, call it a hoax, or try to equate this to things the US has done. This is exactly what Russia wants - whether you like the outcome of the election or not, this entire scheme is not in place for the US to come out better than it was. </p>

<p>None of this means any of it is right. For our country to be the &quot;free beacon of democracy&quot; in the world and undertake these actions is incredibly hypocritical. But to try and equate this and another country&#39;s semi-successful plot to intervene in OUR processes to hamstring our world standing should be denounced uniformly by anyone calling themselves a patriot in this country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel we as a country have gotten carried away with a sense of entitlement over the politics of other countries. It began as a concept of being proactive, we justified our influence as a necessary part of keeping the country safe. After all, wouldn&#39;t you much rather a dangerous person never take office than have to go to war when they do? However these proactive measures that are either kept in secret or boasted as being for the greater good of our country are not calculated risks. The publicized reason for going to war in Iraq, which is a textbook example of a preventative war, turned out to be completely false. Meddling in another countries affairs is the new normal, and arguably not that new.</p>

<p>the USA is 100% at fault for Iraq and Afghanistan you can point to 9/11 but again the targets picked weren&#39;t the perpetrators oil and opium was the actual reason.  The countries that did lend support did it out of political pressure not any other reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what you’re saying and I appreciate you sharing your thoughts with me.</p>

<p>What I don’t get is the deep state argument. For example I come from a heavy Republican State. Pretty much all our elected officials are republican, they all suck. They all sucked on bushes titty. Now they all deeply suck on trumps titty. </p>

<p>None of them are there to remove any “deep state” but I feel as if it is implied the deep state is strictly, Bush, Clinton type cronies. </p>

<p>If that was the case than why are all my republican politicians, all of whom love Trump ie Scott Pruitt, Mary Fallin, will do anything to further his bullshit agenda. Which is basically the same agenda as the former bush agenda. </p>

<p>Who is or who is not deep state? If Trump is not deep state, why does he have so many deep state actors around him? Why doesn’t he really do anything that the deep state wouldn’t approve of? Frankly I don’t trust my state to have more authority because they’re all idiots who can’t run a state properly and would rather sell out to corporate interests. Which is the same exact thing the trump admin is doing and tbh really is the same thing the Obama admin did.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the post. Anytime I ever posted that the US really has no standing in calling out others for election meddling since we’ve done it to multiple other countries over multiple years. </p>

<p>But every time I do, I get the flood brigade of “you and your whataboutism” comment replies dismissing my post. </p>

<p>Yes, the US government has meddled and it is well documented.  In an era where I don’t have to cross over the border to pound actual pavement to pass out fliers or post political signs, it’s fair game for everyone. Nobody knows your IP address, or even if they do, they don’t know if you’re coming from a proxy or tor node. Nobody knows that you’re not really their similarly minded neighbor making interesting comments and talking points.   With the internet, we have no borders. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its so casual that calling it &quot;election meddling&quot; is absurd media sensationalism.</p>

<p>By your definition AIPAC is election meddling every time they pay for ads promoting Israeli interests. All the foreign shareholders in the media are also election meddling as well.</p>

I’m not going to argue the evidence part because of you don’t believe it you don’t believe it but it doesn’t make it right for outside forces to mess with out elections. elections were for AMERICANS to partake in period! Stop trying to justify it, in the fight against evil you must avoid becoming the evil you deplore </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Is meddling in a foreign election always wrong for everyone no matter what?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That depends on how you define meddling. I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s wrong to try to subvert an authoritarian government&#39;s control over elections. The US has done that from time to time, but we&#39;ve also toppled democratically elected leaders, financed insurgencies against democratically elected governments, etc. The US does not have clean hands when it comes to free and fair elections. Not at all!</p>

<p>That being said, at a very high level, any external influence in an otherwise free and fair election should be seen as a hostile act, certainly. It is a direct attack (and I mean that very specifically) on sovereignty when it comes to democracy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The biggest impact Russia had was to release Accurate information...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whether the information that Russia released was accurate or not has nothing to do with any question of whether or not their actions constituted a hostile act against the sovereignty of the United States.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The United States is not measurably worse in any quantifiable way as a result of this election</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What universe do you live in?! Pretty much everything uncovered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Counsel_investigation_(2017%E2%80%93present)">the special counsel&#39;s investigation</a> has been horrifically destructive to the Office of the President, its authority and credibility, probably for decades to come. It got us a president who is actively subverting the ongoing capacities of the FBI and intelligence services both in terms of the precedents for how the executive interacts with active investigations and in terms of the outing of sources and methods used in investigations. It got us a much more polarized and intransigent government. It alienated us from many of our allies. It lead to the portrayal of the US, internationally as anti-intellectual and uninformed. It may well end up leading to the stacking of a US Supreme Court in favor of presidential power on a scale that the US has been strongly opposed to since its founding. It has lead to the first time the president has been an unindicted co-conspirator in a criminal investigation since Nixon!</p>

<p>How do you even begin to make such a claim?!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The left, reddit, MSM, all act like Hilary would be a &quot;normal&quot; president</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know what a &quot;normal&quot; president is anymore, but certainly, she would not have been tweeting insults at random celebrities and taking advice on how to run the country from entertainment show hosts... She would not have stoked the fires of racism, engaged in a trade war with no end-game, alienated our allies, eroded the standing of the office and the nation, or had several of her staff indicted and convicted of serious crimes.</p>

<p>So, is that &quot;normal&quot; now? Ugh, if so that&#39;s terrible commentary.</p>

<p>&gt; YOU brought up the country implying it&#39;s some recent thing , because I addressed our intervention for the past 50/60 years. </p>

<p>Ummmm, meddling right now is about as recent as it gets lol.</p>

<p>And no, you haven&#39;t addressed jack shit, you are trying to tell people to ignore the past, when it is the past that got you to where you are to today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so now how is this admitted failure help solidify your claims on how the tax base is able to guide the direction the country takes.</p>

<p>look at your countries history and look at all the damage that has been caused from installing favorable governments it goes really far back but just look at the main ones the korean war vietnam Iraq Iran (the coup think the shaw) afghanistan and this is just pure aggression I could go on for pages citing atrocities committed under your name and as you stated under your watch. 
now think of these countries being kids on a school yard there is a point where the enemy of my enemy is the greater threat.  I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m able to make it much simpler.</p>
