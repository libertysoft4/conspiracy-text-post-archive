<p>I’ve only been doing this for a week or two and it’s insane how self absorbed and sheeplike people are. I go to school and see everyone on Snapchat, Instagram, etc and all they care about is sex and themselves. None of them want to become a great person that changes anything at all, they’re just hooked on temporary pleasure. </p>

<p>Did you guys know the pull to refresh function was originally implemented by Facebook because they realized it had the same psychological effects of pulling a slot machine. And that they changed the notification icon from blue to red because it makes it seem more urgent in the back of our heads. </p>

<p>Despite Starbucks being an insanely liberal organization, it seems like it’s the only place I can visit at 8-9pm and see people genuinely talking to each other or studying for school. </p>

That’s somewhere between the top 88% and 93% out of everyone who took it, in other words I’m in the top 7-12%</p>

<p>SAT average is 1060, and I got a 1210
I’m only in the top ~17% for the SAT but if I retook I’d probably be higher up</p>

<p>According to the official ACT-SAT correspondence chart, my 28 on the ACT is the equivalent of a 1310 on the SAT</p>

That’s why if you’re a minority vs a white person and both have mediocre scores, the minority is gonna get in.

    <div class="md"><p>One thing you could do just for yourself, is leave your smart phone at home. Disengage from needing the thing everywhere you go every minute of the day. Doing this leaves you face to face with real reality and the world that happening all around you. It&#39;s much easier to engage when your primary instrument of distraction is no longer in your pocket. Doing this, you will notice others who are off the sauce and also engaged in more personal interactions.</p>

<p>Everytime I mention to people who are annoyed by mobile tech/surveillance to leave their smart phones at home and enjoy, I get downvoted all to hell. Persecuted really.</p>

Weed along with  One Piece saved me from suicide but the sheeps Ive witnessed in my uni or even some of my inner circle friends have no deeo thought or a self realisation about themselves or the world. Its just giggling and munching. Sometimes I feel like weed is wasted on those type of people, I may sound like an elitest saying this but if weed save me from suicide then it should give tou a profound meaning to your existence instead of just one dimenaionally thinking and living up the weed stereotypw from the 50s. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone’s different but I think a lot of it has to do with the stereotype. I don’t think if we gave weed to someone who’s never heard of it, that they would be hungry and eating a ton. I think people do it to be a part of the stereotype, but then after the first or second time they associate it with weed and do it every time. Maybe that’s just me though </p>
