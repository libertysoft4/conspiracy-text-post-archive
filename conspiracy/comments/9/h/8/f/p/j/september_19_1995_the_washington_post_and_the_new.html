Supposedly the essays were turned over to an  anonymous attorney,  who  would later session vehemently and abusingly,  confront and belittle Kaczinsky, using the content of his essays against  him. Kaczinsky endured 200 hours of this  psychological torment, which  were filmed and repeatedly played back to him, while electrodes   monitored his physiological reactions. </p>

<p>I am sorry i have been trying to Post this, with a good picture of Kaczinsky all morning, as opposed to the one taken during the perp walk, without success. The procedure for posting images and links is confusing and requires a reversion to the Old Reddit to even come close to complying. Frankly, i am never going to try an add content to this sub reddit ever again.</p>

<p>I think what the media has deemed &quot;the alt-right&quot; is doing a lot of good in letting people know that we have a problem and it needs fixed. We have a long way to go, but I feel we are at the beginning of their movement, not the end. The best way in today&#39;s society is just to get on social media and vlog away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a little confused about the extent of his involvement in these experiments. Kaczynski recently wrote a letter in response to the Manhunter series downplaying the impact and saying his participation involved the completion of a bunch of questionnaires and around 30 mins face to face. However in previous correspondence, such as that detailed in the Atlantic article from 2000 linked below, he seems to have hinted at more extensive involvement. I know that Ted had grave concerns around being perceived as &quot;mentally incompetent&quot;, and can see the advantage of mainstream publications pushing a &quot;broken&quot; narrative for him as a way of discrediting his ideas. I&#39;m not sure what to think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it&#39;s very much the latter. Ted is very...image conscious? Everything is calculated and meticulously procured when it comes to putting his ideas forward. </p>

<p>He&#39;s stressed on many occasion the importance of letting his ideas speak for themselves and should be thought about without any preconceived notions. Mixed with his narcissistic personality, there&#39;s no doubt in my mind that he&#39;s downplaying his involvement in these &quot;therapy&quot; sessions in an effort to attract more people to his ideas. </p>

But, to answer your question I can&#39;t figure out how to post images and links on this sub-reddit. So, what&#39;s the point for me of posting anything at all.</p>
