It&#39;s not going to happen even though Trump promised all Americans he would do it. I&#39;d like to see us all, regardless of party preference, to ask this from him in good faith. Is he really a maverick, or just another face for the rulers. I&#39;d be less critical of the poor being butt fucked if we got this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re basically just waiting to see the real evidence like everyone else.</p>

<p>Yes, we are convinced that Q and POTUS are working together.</p>

<p>Many are convinced that they are working in our interests, but the core of this group will turn on Q and Trump on a dime if we have good reason to believe that isn&#39;t the case. We aren&#39;t zealous blind followers, and I encourage everyone here to question everything.</p>

<p>Contrary to your claim that Trump supporters don&#39;t challenge and just believe, we came to the conclusion that Q is legit by endlessly scrutinizing his posts and researching what they had to say. </p>

<p>So far, we have good reason to believe that something explosive will be contained within the 20 pg FISA declassification.  If that isn&#39;t the case, then Q will be more or less dead, and I doubt Trump will win another election. I&#39;m not really sure what will happen, and I am weary that this whole thing will backfire. But Q has been an incredible source for the last 10 months for anyone who was willing to pay attention.</p>

When Obama did JCPOA and made American firms that illegally seized Iran&#39;s money because a few bad men, it was blasted and so controversial. Now Trump is hiding the Israel sell out. Shows you who trumps daddy is and a lot of Trump supporters hate Israel&#39;s leadership but have been quiet because they trust trump. If this was Obama, it would be nutssss</p>

<p>If he does it and the new investigation concludes that the first investigation was wrong and the CIA or mossad or someone else did it, all the people who believe the first investigation won&#39;t believe this one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump said his mission, as the political outsider, was to upend “the establishment”. Whether that’s the Intelligence Community, political elite, Mainstream news, didn’t matter to him; no one was safe, or so he said.</p>

<p>Reopening the investigation would be perhaps his opportunity to blow the lid on everything, or at least present the public with the right questions. Did everyone think that “the establishment” (which both R’s and D’s have bemoaned for decades as a political buzzword) would be disrupted quietly? Was Trump suggesting that he could infiltrate and shut it down by his lonesome? Americans plead for revolution, but no one seems to be willing to stop talking bullshit and take a swing. If there were more political factions, i think civil war would likely break out. However, that doesn’t benefit Trump or anyone that may be pulling the strings (not yet, at least), or else he’d be keeping his promises, right?</p>

<p>the trump tower meeting isnt &quot;fake news&quot;. its admitted that they attended the meeting with the intent of obtaining damaging info against hillary.</p>

<p>trump said they were going to release damaging info on hillary days before the tt meeting.</p>

<p>its glaringly obvious they made a deal. the russians released that info and in return they got ???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your sentiment, but I can also see how, if you were going up against a powerful global cabal, you would <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/veritasvisuals/videos">have trouble wresting control back from every bureaucracy</a>.</p>

<p>When you look back in history, situations like this can bubble for years and then explode with activity, but we are stuck in a short term feedback loop mindset. That being said, you are right to point out that he should re-open the 9/11 investigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The easy answer is &quot;Trump doesn&#39;t really care about x&quot; where &quot;x&quot; is whatever thing he&#39;s promised to look into/fix/get rid of/etc. I personally don&#39;t believe he&#39;s a puppet, he just says whatever thing he needs to do to look good in the moment, but has once that moment&#39;s gone he&#39;s off onto the next thing.</p>
