<p>The type that makes the masses feel they have an advocate in the white house, butressed by Q&#39;s posts, when in fact hrc&#39;s best friend is now the president. </p>

<p>It is easy to type out some populist rhetoric that resonates with people. If hrc said that crap you would know it was bs, But for some reason the  billionaire tan boy from Manhattan gets a pass. &quot;Research&quot; entails not falling for some crass attempt to appeal to emotion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, I like your post history. Honestly. Thank you for contributing to the discussion.</p>

<p>I would argue that the neocons and globalists are NOT getting what they want out of the US Mil in Syria. That the US Mil is not advocating globalist neocon war. That Wolfowitz and Kristol are not happy campers.</p>

<p>Honest questions. What were the targets of US v Syria airstrikes #2,3 under Trump. Just because they occurred on Syrian soil does not mean Assad necessarily minded them or even opposed them.</p>

<p>The Assadists by 2018 are a conglomerate of 100s of local warlords. Were they Iranian targets? Were they rogue CIA targets? Were they HTS targets? Could those three entities (among others) forge local temporary alliances and/or establish DS facilities together? Did US Mil deconflict with Russia AND Syria regarding strikes 2 and 3.</p>

<p>I would give Trump the benefit of the doubt for Strike 1. The world is a messy place and he may have not consolidated power enough by April 2017 to resist striking Syria even if he had intel the Chem attack that month was FF.</p>

<p>I do not know. But I know if Hil+Co won, it would not be only 3 precision strikes in Assadist territory by this point.</p>

<em>There is a reason Ron Paul is not POTUS and Trump is. RP should read the art of the deal. I wrote him in twice, but in the end RP=ineffective. Compromise is necessary. Not every single Goldman guy=bad. Not every Syrian airstrike is bad/serves Israel.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you most likely are right. Q is a fraud and Drumpf is a corrupt billionaire. Hope for our constitutional Republic and humanity in general is lost. We may as well submit to the ZOG overlords, bicker amongst ourselves endlessly, or remain so superbly idealistic that, though we will not improve the human condition, our shit won&#39;t stink.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I CHOOSE not to believe that. I CHOOSE to believe the American people and people of goodwill across planet earth have many extra gears we have not engaged, and forgot we have. That we will surprise ourselves with our compassion, unity, creativeness, and commitment to freedom and justice.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I CHOOSE to believe there are more good than bad in government, that if given the choice, even bad actors would recant and change hats. That WE THE PEOPLE can hold public servants who have broken the public trust to a full accounting, and that there are heros in and out of the military that would sacrifice ALL to restore the Republic and its rule of law.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Seriously, this may well be a LARP. I do not care. I have followed 911Truth since 2004 and have never seen such OPTIMISM among my fellow travellers. Post Q, I will be supporting the Great Awakening, running for public office, or in the French foreign legion. God bless you and, humor me, will you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily. Are you attributing claims by the broader movement to Q itself? Or are you finding fault with Q post 1&amp;2. A lot has happened since then. Much has come to pass. Future proves past. NO ONE else was talking about Peter Strozk in December &#39;17. Don&#39;t make me pull out the proofs! :)</p>

<p>Being a military intelligence op, it is quite natural to expect disinformation baked in. Disinfo is real. Disinfo is necessary. If you had WORLD CLASS sigint, would you not observe targets&#39; reactions after Qpost 1&amp;2?</p>

<p>Some of the program&#39;s many goals are:
1. Raise the geopolitical literacy of the citizenry 
2. Communicate in code to certain operators
3. Communicate openly to the enemy
4. Raise morale
5. Strengthen the administration&#39;s base
6. Destroy the MSM</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q first used the term “Great Awakening” on the second day of posting, October 29th, 2017, and has used it many times since. On January 8th, 2018, Q first used the phrase, “Where we go one, we go all” (WWG1WGA). Q has used many other phrases, including “Truth belongs to the people”, “The choice to know will ultimately be yours”, “Expand your thinking”, “Dark to light”,  “You are not alone in this fight”, “Good will always defeat evil”, “Future proves past”, &quot;Read the Bible. God Wins&quot;, “You are the calm before and during the storm”, and many others. These phrases signal – to the anons that decode, research, and spread the crumbs, and to the public as well – that we can help President Trump fight the Cabal by educating others about what it is that we are fighting. Q reminds anons and the public that this fight’s, “Scope and size [is the] biggest in history”, to “Trust the Plan”, and to “Stay the course.” The Plan to fight the Cabal was initiated by Patriots, and Patriots were, are, and will be helping the President execute it.<br/>
The Great Awakening is not a conspiracy theory or a cult, as those who seek to discredit would like the public to think. It is a sophisticated and coordinated information operation from within President Trump’s administration to enlighten the public about the true state of affairs of the nation and the world, providing vast amounts of information well beyond the scope of this introduction. So vast in fact, that Q has stated, “These, the crumbs, in time, will equate to the biggest drops ever disclosed in our history.” Ultimately an informed public is a key component of Making America Great Again and Keeping America Great. The Declaration of Independence that led to the founding of the great Nation that is the United States of America states that, “Whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government” and such is relevant today. We The American People acted in accordance with this ideal by electing President Trump to renew our government, and Q, through the Great Awakening, is enlightening We The People about what the enemies of the people have done, are doing, and will do to fight this historic change. The intensification of attacks against Q, the Great Awakening, We The People, Patriots, the President, and the United States of America is indicative of the ferocious level of resistance to the loss of power and control of those whose deeds and true objectives are being exposed. In order to mitigate the confusion in this time of chaos, Q has asked anons to help be the Calm Before and During The Storm. To this end, Q also asks anons and all those who have been preyed upon, to pray.
God bless the Nations of the World, and God bless a World of Nations.
God bless all Patriots, President Trump, and the United States of America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Q movement is instrumental in exposing FISA abuse -- it goes beyond the Russia investigation. When you abuse state secrets powers to surveil journalists, judges, laywers, and whistleblowers, etc. (the news today) civil society breaks down. Declass and arrest bad actors in CIA/FBI/DOJ/State etc. The Q movement has been the tip of the spear in demanding prosecutions for spies gone wild.</p>

<p>There is more...Q said Saudi Arabia &gt; North Korea &gt; Iran &gt; Israel (in that order). There is silent war. Please dig, pray, meme, vote, and when the time comes, get in the streets.</p>

<p>I will not get into what we have learned about the Cabal, NXIVM, NK, Red Cross, Vatican, Rothchilds, Payseurs, Crown etc. On the other side of the Q movement is literally a new era for humanity as corrupt power brokers WW enter the [killbox].</p>

<p>Or it is a big larp. Do your own research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Transnational elite families and organizations control the governments and financiers of the world by means of blackmail and bribery. They fund operations in a pyramid scheme/mafia structure and control most of the world trade of: drugs, weapons, intel, cash, people, organs. The anons have traced every mineral deposit&#39;s major stakeholders and investors back worldwide. For some unknown reason, truly wonderful and extremely intelligent individuals, autistic and not, have gathered/are gathering and crowdsourcing a much different dataset than the mainstream media and the narratives continue to diverge. Fisa will bring down the house of cards and begin the period of high-level arrests -- openly -- worldwide. Or it is all made up. But I have watched in realtime something amazing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>GOJP, </p>

<p>I get that you are trying to spread the message that there are things going on behind the scenes that the public is not privy to. I used to think this whole Q thing was a bunch of wing nuts talking gibberish and calling each other names on 8chan. Welp..it is and it isn&#39;t. I can say, it definitely isn&#39;t what the media has made it out to be. </p>

<p>Regardless of the conspiracy boloney, this is my opinion.</p>

<p>My take is that this is a movement of people who found hope in the form of an anonymous poster who has Q clearance, which is reserved for military communications, (tell me if I&#39;m wrong here). Months ago, info was posted by this Q person/persons and we were given a puzzle to solve and that gave us all a feeling we were part of something bigger. Something that would make us feel like we mattered in this day of the &quot;little guy always getting the shaft&quot;. Q gave us information that was posted one day and became fact shortly thereafter. You get enough of those and you start to wonder; What is this Q thing all about?</p>

<p>You start to consider the possibility we might be able to make a difference if we all stuck together.  We can research the info we get and find out what is actually happening in our world. Things are changing globally and I think we can all feel it. Clearly things aint pretty! </p>

<p>What if we had a chance to be a positive force for change in this world rather than resolve to live in this crappy, out of control society with abuse of power at the top and abuse of each other at the bottom?</p>

<p>We just want a better happier world with less bad guys running the show. </p>

<p>(Thats maybe what I would start with.) </p>

<p>So to be clear, I am not trying to rain on any parade. Me thinks the &quot;map&quot; might be too soon for some who still think we are wing nuts.... However... I will say you are a true patriot! That you for this post, #WWG1WGA!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, I like your post history. Honestly. Thank you for contributing to the discussion.</p>

<p>I would argue that the neocons and globalists are NOT getting what they want out of the US Mil in Syria. That the US Mil is not advocating globalist neocon war. That Wolfowitz and Kristol are not happy campers.</p>

<p>Honest questions. What were the targets of US v Syria airstrikes #2,3 under Trump. Just because they occurred on Syrian soil does not mean Assad necessarily minded them or even opposed them.</p>

<p>The Assadists by 2018 are a conglomerate of 100s of local warlords. Were they Iranian targets? Were they rogue CIA targets? Were they HTS targets? Could those three entities (among others) forge local temporary alliances and/or establish DS facilities together? Did US Mil deconflict with Russia AND Syria regarding strikes 2 and 3.</p>

<p>I would give Trump the benefit of the doubt for Strike 1. The world is a messy place and he may have not consolidated power enough by April 2017 to resist striking Syria even if he had intel the Chem attack that month was FF.</p>

<p>I do not know. But I know if Hil+Co won, it would not be only 3 precision strikes in Assadist territory by this point.</p>
