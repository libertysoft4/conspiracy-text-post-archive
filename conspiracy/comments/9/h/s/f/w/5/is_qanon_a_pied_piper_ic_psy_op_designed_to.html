        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-09-21 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Prison4SideofBeef.html">Prison4SideofBeef</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hypothesis: QAnon is a government/spook psy op pied piper designed to pacify and distract boomers in the MAGA movement. Q encourages people to sit back and wait while &quot;the good guys&quot; take care of business. Q convinces dissidents that the sun is shining and the birds are chirping.</p>

<p>My theory:</p>

<p>QAnon in my subjective opinion is too sophisticated to be a troll LARP. Qanon is a government psy op similar to cicada.</p>

<p>A cult has quickly formed around Q. An entire industry of pundits and news sites looking to monetize the cult has formed around Q. The MSM is writing about Q. All of these things point to me that Q is a government psy op.</p>

<p>My theory about what is going to happen moving forward:</p>

<p>The spooks running Q are running out of material, which is why they are now talking about ayylmaos and UFO disclosure (also predicted programming for project bluebeam in case they wind up pulling this out in the future.)</p>

<p>In the somewhat near future, Q is going to stop posting. With their pied piper gone, the cult of Q is going to fall in to depression and despair. Many in the cult will assume &quot;Q and the good guy patriots&quot; lost, and will begin committing suicide, or acts of violence against &quot;deep staters and radical lefties.&quot;</p>

<p>*If Q was an actual dissident patriot operation fighting a coup against our shadow government, the MSM spook mockingbird media would not give it more publicity. They want the Q movement to grow bigger because they want to blame all the upcoming Q-cult suicides and false flags on Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Trump is having security remove Q signs from his rallies BECAUSE HE IS AWARE OF THE PSY OP.</p>

<h1>As for the &quot;Q proofs&quot;-Q doesn&#39;t predict things. Q is a government psy op, and the government (via NSA and other ICs) are everywhere and know everything that is going to happen before it happens. They are the top intelligence service in the world for a reason. &quot;Q proofs&quot; are just confirmation bias and soft disclosure. &quot;Tippy top&quot; for example is just a phrase that Trump is recorded as saying on camera several times in the past-ICs would definitely be aware of Trump&#39;s speaking patterns so they could copy it if they ever needed to. Like if they needed to run psy ops on their population for example...</h1>

<p>They banned QAnon discussion on reddit because they are well aware of the Streissand effect and they are well aware that this would help further legitimize the psy op in the eyes of the cult of Q. Do you really think &quot;these people are stupid&quot;? That is exactly what our ICs want you to think about them. <em>Never underestimate your enemy, and do not act like you&#39;ve won before the battle was over.</em> If Q was a legit patriot faction working on behalf of the American people, it would be well aware of these basics.</p>

<p>TL;DR-Q is a pied piper psy op ran by the deep state designed to honeypot boomers and dissidents and pacify MAGA. The eventual plan is for Q to stop posting, then the cult that has developed around Q will begin going crazy.
Q Anon mixes real information, soft disclosure, and rabbit hole bullshit. Q Anon plays on our confirmation biases and uses NLP to program and brainwash people who follow the posts.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, this is just my theory. I encourage everyone to think for themselves and think critically. Be wary of hitching your wagon blindly to any movement.</p>

<p>They all think Trump is just the greatest and Q reinforces that. It&#39;s designed to augment and radicalize that movement.

<p>Remember 2016? Compare the MAGA movement now to how passionate it was in 2016. That&#39;s your answer.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes. Imagine the cognitive dissidence that will hit the cult when Q stops posting and nothing that Q promised happens. Imagine what the craziest members of the cult might do, or how easy it would be for ICs to frame and set up false flags with them.</p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly my point. The most radical Qanon supporters have become blind cultists. They are being set up by the FBI as patsies for future false flags that they can use to discredit and delegitimize all conspiracy discussion online.</p>

<p>They can also use it as an excuse to go after and ban and censor the chans.</p>

<p>&quot;Follow the plan&quot; encourages inaction and complacency. Q could be encouraging people interested in these politics to do direct action. He could utilize the movement toward a productive goal. Instead, the goal is to wrap people up in mysterious memes and get them to back the government&#39;s plans. </p>

<p>The Gulf of Tonkin incident that lead us to the Vietnam War was a false flag.</p>

<p>Operation Northwoods was a planned false flag on our own citizens that our top military officials all signed off on. Ever heard of it?</p>

<p>The deep state is not imaginary. Pedogate is not imaginary. Our government is fucked up.</p>

<p>The stroyk comey stuff is the soft disclosure. Yes our government is very corrupt. All this stuff was leaking-the American public was waking up and people were getting pissed.</p>

<p>Enter Q-Anon to pacify the most passionate dissident patriots and voters.</p>

<p>Pacification and radicalization is the first phase of the psy op.</p>

<p>Phase two is when they will start weaponizing the cult, most likely for false flags that they will use to justify internet censorship imo. I also see many of the Q-cultists voluntarily committing suicide (lemmings jumping off a cliff) when Q stops posting and reality starts to hit them.</p>

<p>What does your second question have to do with your initial statement.</p>

<p>Ok-I use the word cult because that&#39;s exactly what many Q followers are becoming-cultists. Not all Q followers-but the most hardcore are definitely behaving like blind cultists. That is not meant as an insult,  just the truth.</p>

<p>Boomer is just a meme and I did not mean it as offensive. I myself am 26 and considered a &quot;boomer&quot; by many people on the internet.</p>

<p>However by boomer, I was referring to the &quot;Baby boomer&quot; demographic of people born in the 50s. If I say baby boomer, will that offend you less?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is underneath it all a standard conservative, his administration epitomizes the swamp.  Yet because the meme Trump, the idea of someone actually draining the swamp/fighting the deep state (like with the change Obama was supposed to bring), is so much better than actual Trump, thus forming a major basis of his support, the deep state knows they need to manage this dissonance if actual Trumpism is going to have a shot.</p>

<p>Q keeps the faithful in line, by convincing them that Trump doing in public the opposite of what they claim to want is in fact Trump secretly fulfilling their wildest dreams.  Thus, as long as Trump is on the board, plenty of well-intentioned people can be kept as loyal partisans regardless of events. (This also enables the deep state to do some partisan disciplining on the left as well, although that&#39;s more general strategy than Q-specific).</p>

<p>Furthermore, this gives them the perfect narrative for after Trump leaves (when/however that is), depending on how they end the storyline.</p>

<p>Trump is underneath it all a standard conservative, his administration epitomizes the swamp.</p>

<p>Ok, he was always considered a New York Democrat and beloved by the media before he ran for president. I wonder what suddenly changed.</p>

<p>Also you used the word Trump 8 times in that two paragraph post. Please consider varying your wordage.</p>

<p>It is soft disclosure of true information mixed with complete bullshit and charlatan vagueries. Q-proofs just play on confirmation biases, or are things the government already knows about (hence the &quot;prediction.&quot;)</p>

<p>I seriously fear what is going to happen when Q stops posting and the psy op ends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you did a good job on the theory. Whats interesting is that you have a wide spectrum of Q followers. Some all in that just blindly follow and are convinced without research of their own. Some at the other end of the spectrum are full on LARP but yours in interesting because your putting the government psyop in play. That gives weighted credit to Q having unique access to deep intel. I just don&#39;t buy the deep intel portion because the LAARPS are using hacking to present info before others and that&#39;s the &#39;trick&#39; . If Sessions does not deliver Q is over and outed.  Q was doxxed quite some time ago, so the government does not seem to be involved. Then again we don&#39;t know for sure. Either way here is the dox job:</p>

<p>who is this hacker dude and if he actually doxxed Q&#39;s orginator why is this not blowing up in the MSM? I have seen about 5 people claim to have Q&#39;s doxx and they all lead to 5 different people who aren&#39;t connected.</p>
