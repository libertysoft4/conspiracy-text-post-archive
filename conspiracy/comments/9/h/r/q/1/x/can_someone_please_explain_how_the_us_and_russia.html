        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The “Cold War” is a giant crock of shit. It’s the original “war on terror”,  we call it a war, but the enemies are faceless and the conflict can go on forever, because there’s no winning against an ideology. It’s decades of propaganda </p>

<p>The actual conflicts involved in the Cold War, like the war in Vietnam, were exclusively fought by either the United States military against a communist faction in a 3rd world country, or by communist and nationalist factions in 3rd world countries, with neither the USSR or the US getting directly involved. </p>

<p>Please tell me, how are two countries selling weapons to either side of a conflict  enemies? Sounds like people working together to make money. When exactly have American and Russians soldiers actually fought and killed each other? As far as I know, never. </p>

<p>America was involved in these conflicts like Korea and Vietnam so that the American military industrial complex could sell more weapons to the US military. That’s the only reason. The myth of “stopping the spread of communism” is such bullshit it’s not even accepted in whitewashed history books any more. </p>

<p>As far as I know, Russia never got directly involved in any conflict during the Cold War. Maybe I’m wrong, I learned the history from the America point of view. But the AK-47 is a Russian gun, and the most widely sold and used gun in the world. The Russian military industrial complex was more than happy to sell these guns and plenty of other weapons to any communist faction who wanted to buy. </p>

<p>Once again, all I see here is two countries making tons of money off of war. And using each other as the proverbial “boogie man” to keep its citizens in line. Working together to create a global climate of fear. What do people do when they’re afraid? They shut the fuck up, put their heads down, fall in line, and consume. The anti communist propaganda was especially brilliant because it caused people to start policing themselves. Better fall in line and act exactly like everyone else, or risk being called a commie and ostracized by your own community. </p>

<p>The space race is the perfect example of this. People in America were fed up with the government wasting all their money on an arms race for the biggest nuclear arsenal. So what did the American government do? Find a way to repackage it into some noble quest for future technology and the exploration of space. Public opinion was once again swayed back to heavily supporting this “space race”, even though the rockets they were developing had obvious military application. The same rockets that America poured billions into developing that took men to space, were the same rockets that were capable of delivering a nuclear warhead across continents. And during the whole space race, the United States was secretly putting dozens of spy satellites into space, to create the first military version of google earth, and have ultimate intelligence and spying on a global scale. </p>

<p>Once you realize that the governments of the US and the USSR have never been enemies, so much more becomes obvious. For instance, the biggest “debunking” of the moon landing conspiracy usually goes something like this: “Well America couldn’t possibly have faked the moon landing, because the Russians would have known and called them out on it.” The Russians were in on it. They knew it was faked, and the two governments worked together and agreed that America was to be the one to “make it” to the moon first. </p>

<p>I mean, they had a fucking direct telephone line between the presidents office and the prime ministers office in Russia. You really think they were calling up and threatening each other? I think it’s far more likely the conversation went something like this: </p>

<p>Ring ring </p>

<p>Regan: “Oh hi mr. Gorbachov. How are you. What should I say today? Ok, tell them the USSR has threatened to move nuclear weapons into Cuba? Sounds good. And you tell your people, that America has its finger on the button, and we’re always ready for war. Good? Ok, talk to you later.”</p>

<p>“Get the press secretary in here, tell her the Russians just threatened to put nuclear missiles in Cuba. “ </p>

<p>News goes out to the American public: Russia has threatened to put nukes in Cuba! Omg, panic! </p>

<p>All manufactured, all propaganda, all a lie. </p>

<p>Now of course I know about the Cuban missile crisis and other “close calls” where nuclear war almost happened. No, really bro, it seriously almost happened. </p>

<p>Yeah, but it didn’t. And the narrative around these events was always controlled by the government and by the MSM. They can tell whatever story they want and the people will eat it up and canonize it as history. </p>

<p>Now this stupid red scare shit is coming around again and I can’t believe how easily people are just eating it up. Omg, trump colluded with Russia! </p>

<p>Of course he did. So did Hillary. Every single US administration since WWII has colluded with Russia. It’s only the brainwashed masses who think we are enemies. The reality is we’ve been closer to business partners for decades now. </p>

<p>I would love to see any evidence of there being actual conflict between America and the USSR, that isn’t just a story coming out of the military of the government. If anyone can help me learn, I would love it. Because right now all I can see is two countries working together to keep their citizens in line, to get public support behind pouring billions into developing military tech, and to sell as many weapons as possible to whoever would buy them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia is the only world superpower who has any chance of destroying the US, solely because of their nuclear weapons and the sheer amount of them. The US has been attempting to encircle Russia as a country via NATO—getting countries surrounding Russia to join NATO—since the USSR collapsed. The US lied to Gorbachev about NATO expansion. The US and Russia are and have been in a staring contest together in the Middle East because strategically oil fields and control of the energy  supplies and pipelines is Russia&#39;s bread and butter. Both countries have aligned themselves with other countries in proxy wars, instead of facing one another outright, which would lead to WW3. Russia with Iran and Syria and China and even cozzying up to NATO member Turkey for strategic benefit while the US uses Saudi Arabia, Israel and others as proxies. It all goes back to when the Arab oil countries gor together in the 70s when Jimmy Carter was president and oil/gas prices were raised dramatically—that&#39;s why the US gives Saudi Arabia pass after pass and backs them no matter what.</p>

<p>The US&#39;s goal is to encircle Russia with NATO member countries, issue financial crippling sanctions and infiltrate and topple Putin and its government from within. That&#39;s why Putin invaded Ukraine, which had been a part of the USSR and Russia before that. Ukraine neigbors Russia. Look into who funded the coup in Ukraine a few years ago which toppled its democratically elected government. The US. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia has been unofficially supporting the US since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_League_of_Armed_Neutrality">1780</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first League of Armed Neutrality was an alliance of European naval powers between 1780 and 1783 which was intended to protect neutral shipping against the Royal Navy&#39;s wartime policy of unlimited search of neutral shipping for French contraband...</p>

<p>Empress Catherine II of Russia began the first League with her declaration of Russian armed neutrality on 11 March [O.S. 28 February] 1780, during the War of American Independence. She endorsed the right of neutral countries to trade by sea with nationals of belligerent countries without hindrance, except in weapons and military supplies. Russia would not recognize blockades of whole coasts, but only of individual ports, and only if a belligerent&#39;s warship were actually present or nearby. The Russian navy dispatched three squadrons to the Mediterranean, Atlantic, and North Sea to enforce this decree</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moving forward a few decades, we have the not well-known fact that Britain and France encouraged and supported the Confederacy, and that <a href="https://knowledgenuts.com/2015/02/01/how-the-russian-navy-saved-the-union-in-the-civil-war/">Russian intervention</a> kept them from directly joining the war:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A little-known alliance between the US and Tsarist Russia led to the Russian fleet showing up in force in New York and San Francisco. It arrived at a crucial time in 1863 when Britain and France were on the verge of intervening in the Civil War on the side of the Confederacy. An actual world war was on the horizon that would “wrap the world in flames” as Secretary of State William Seward put it. The mighty Russian presence deterred the Anglo-French from invading, and the Union was saved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Russia was on America&#39;s side in WWI, and WWII. It might be accurate to describe the European theater of WWII as Russia fighting Germany with American guns. Because Britain and the US did a tiny fraction of the heavy lifting there.</p>

<p>The Cold War? Also <a href="http://tarpley.net/online-books/against-oligarchy/how-the-harriman-gang-started-the-cold-war/">started by Anglophiles</a>. FDR wanted to break up the British Empire and make Britain a second-rate power while the US and Russia created a new world order centered around cooperative economic development. When FDR died (possibly poisoned) the patsy Truman gave up on this plan and gave into the new strategy of tension.</p>

<p>British-style geopolitics always does this. Play the 1st and 2nd most powerful nations against each other, so the Empire is maintained. It&#39;s a very old strategy, going back to at least the Venetians. Same strategy the current regime is using to maintain the Anglo-America power bloc.</p>

<p>America was involved in these conflicts like Korea and Vietnam so that the American military industrial complex could sell more weapons to the US military. That’s the only reason. The myth of “stopping the spread of communism” is such bullshit it’s not even accepted in whitewashed history books any more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>White House recordings from the Kennedy and Johnson eras make it clear that America got into Vietnam to stop the spread of communism, and stayed in to avoid the humiliation of defeat. There’s no recording of anyone saying “we need this war so some weapons manufacturers can make a profit.”</p>
