        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-09-19 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/ScottVanZandt.html">ScottVanZandt</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Today I had a very strange and alarming experience that would like to get some thoughts on.I ordered food today through Uber Eats as usual. Food was arriving so I went outside.When I hit the call button on Uber to contact the driver, no one answered, not unusual. I called again, and someone answered it... but.. when I told them, hey I&#39;m outside are you here??</p>

<p>They said: No... I think you must have the wrong number, I don&#39;t know what you are talking about.</p>

<p>I call the Ubereats support number again, now for a second time.. this time it sounded like multiple people in a car.I asked, are you with Uber? And the person&#39;s voice was different. Someone said “Say you are from Uber” in the background. The guy on the phone paused for the moment and said yeahh, that&#39;s right. The guy kept asking what my address was repeatedly, he literally said what&#39;s your address? rapidly about 4 times in a row, which I just didn&#39;t respond too. He said after I didn&#39;t respond that he needed my address because apparently my address wasn’t showing up on the Uber App? which I know was probably not common or even possible... that doesn’t happen. I was confused.</p>

<p>I didn’t say my address and he got angry. At that moment my actual Uber driver showed up and I can instantly see he’s not on the phone... As the real uber eats driver walks up, I put the phone on speaker... and tell the imposter driver on the phone my uber eats driver is already here standing in front of me...</p>

<p>The Uber driver didn’t know what to think of it and was confused as well... the guy on the phone hung up almost immediately after I said my Uber Eats driver was right in front of me .... he said, oh yeah? okay, well... I&#39;ll see you soon and then Hung up. In a hostile tone.</p>

<p>Super strange.</p>

<p>I go back to my recent calls and repeat dial the Uber number that led me to this strange convo, and the Uber number is still linked to his number, it hits the voicemail.</p>

<p>A sinister troll like voice fills the speaker as the voicemail box recording plays: &quot;Welcome to Evans Castle What&#39;s Your Hassle?&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t help but laugh, and be pretty creeped out all at the same time. I also was considering the possibility of my Uber Account getting hacked, but it seems fine from what I can tell. Perhaps this was a coincidence of a glitch with the Telecommunications/VoiP of Uber Eats and a few trolls taking advantage, or perhaps... something much worse.</p>

<p>Here are all of the outbound calls I made going out to Ubereats support number. Only 2 of these calls actually had someone pick-up as written above. This all happened in between 5:02PM PST and 5:11PM PST.</p>

<p>There are a bunch more calls in there because after I got off the phone, I decided to keep calling the number back. (You&#39;ll notice I even attempted one call 40 min later) After my delivery was complete, I just got an UberEats message telling me to type in my phone number to talk to support, I would do this and it would say my phone # was not associated with an account. Even though my number was being used on both My Uber and Uber Eats accounts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply @8trk, I actually thought about this right away. But my driver actually got out of his car with his phone in his hand and walked to me. He was trying to call me at the time buy it wasn&#39;t working. There was no one else in the car and the mystery caller was still on the line as I was talking to my actual driver.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen it a lot here in Australia, a driver will ask his friends/family to sign up as &quot;drivers&quot; so he can take/pickup/deliver multiple orders at once.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had Uber show me pictures of a female rider, saying they are delivering on a bicycle, and a guy rocks up in a car and 5 uber order bags in the back seat.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had Uber drivers circle my house (I live in a weird spot), then when I call them to tell them how to find me, the person on the other end puts me on hold while he rings the actual driver.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This makes the most sense. Though it&#39;s a little weird that the OP says he called the support number, and it too went to weird people that didn&#39;t seem affiliated with the company (unless Uber automates the call system so that it recognizes the number with a specific order and routes it to the driver automatically). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well here&#39;s the weird thing, I straight up asked the delivery driver who was dropping off my food if he knew why someone else was on the phone? I asked him why would someone else would answer when I called him through Uber eats, and he had no idea. He really didn&#39;t seem like a guy trying to hustle the system of uber eats, just a college kid making some side money. Also, the uber driver was try to call me as he pulled up with the food, but it didn&#39;t go through. I was already on the phone, with ...someone... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ummmm yeah i would be freaking out. Lol. Sounds to me like there was a glitch on the app maybe and it messed up a digit of the number or something and the person told him to play along so they could try to scam you somehow? Not sure what they expected to happen when they pulled up with no food but that’s creepy as hell. I would be blocking the number and maybe throw your own number into google and make sure it’s not listed in a free public database with your address attached (I found mine listed on several sites with lists of my family members, previous addresses, etc). </p>
