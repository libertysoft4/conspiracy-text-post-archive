    <div class="md"><p>Thats one of mine too. The Gregorian calender timeline change in recent history made me wonder how many times that had happened in the past. I not religous but its made me reflect on what Phillip K. Dick said about us &quot;actually&quot; being alive 50 years after christ (in the 60s).

    <div class="md"><p>Same. How many times we&#39;ve had to start over. Our timeline is kind of nonsense because if you don&#39;t accept the Bible as historical fact, and accept that Jesus was a fictional character, then our entire measurement of years is built around the life of someone who never existed. Finding out maybe we aren&#39;t advancing past our ancestors, but catching up to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The truth about our early history and extraterrestrial interaction. It has always made sense to me that they were describing aliens to the best of their ability. I suspect that the changes in our species that are attributed to evolution are actually essentially version updates. Evolution and Creationism both have the same problem, an omnipotent invisible force making changes. I think it&#39;s not unlike what we do in genetic research. If we had the opportunity to create a entire new species, I have no doubt we would, we are doing so with artificial intelligence. It would be nice just to personally know the significance of our existence. We aren&#39;t alone, and aren&#39;t that special, just ants in an ant farm</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that pretty much sums up the big picture. I see your point of view completely and agree with you. But it makes me wonder, if you and I didn&#39;t have the computer as an anology to describe &quot;how it feels&quot; or to compare to the mechanisms of creation, what kind of language could we use?

    <div class="md"><p>I just think it is naive to assume that civilization has only existed for 5-6,000 years.  The earth has gone through so many radical geological/climatic changes in the 100,000 years homo sapiens have been around.  Ice age, solar flares, floods, tectonic shifts could totally wipe out continents and leave no trace of their existence.</p>

<p>Real or not, it is fun and fascinating to think about.  Carbon dating things like the sphinx&#39;s body and gobekli tepe really have to make you rethink pre-history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If i had to guess...I can see how the brain breaks down external stimuli into things that can be experienced via sensory organs into deciperable electrical signals in the brain. Which creates my &quot;reality experience&quot; for a particuliar event. Then it may also make sense that every personal experience is subjective , which at the same time would make personal reality subjective. And this makes me wonder if the way that things are explained to us may make a fundemental difference in our ability to recognize and identify any changes that aren&#39;t identified by society at large. It seems to be a matter of perspective but i could be wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My initial thought would be what is the actual deal with reincarnation....but I think by knowing that it would somewhat ruin the meaning and point of life.</p>

<p>So I&#39;ll go with this question...</p>

<p>For the ACTUAL psychics in the world, what is the mechanism how they are doing what they are going? If they are able to do it does that mean that theoretically anyone can do it? I would like this to be answered because...</p>

<p>1) It would give some insight into how our reality is constructed beyond things that we can measure.</p>

<p>And</p>

<p>2) It would be a death knell for the scientific materialism paradigm and would force it to integrate into a more cohesive view of reality. This in turn l think would lead to a better world view by many.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fun high theory on reincarnation, I am bored and tired.</p>

<p>We are all one being, Yahweh, but we are individual, we are a part if the whole, but the whole functions separately from its parts, like how we have blood in our system but its not &quot;controlling us&quot;, losing it is bad though. </p>

<p>Reincarnation can be thought of like regenerating a cell, or like increasing the frequency of a wave. It may be necessary if the cell doesn&#39;t evolve on its own or the wave is about to cease to exist/or turn into an AI frequency archon parasite whatever the fuck. </p>

<p>Preservation. Beings that lose the light within them, or do something SUPER evil, or something we don&#39;t know likely lose the ability to reincarnate and don&#39;t learn to increase their frequency naturally so they have to elicit a frequency they are used to in order to simply not diminish.  </p>

<p>Crazy how all the stories of &quot;frequency vampires&quot;, they were written as Archons, although they are known as parasites, I wish I could find more legitimate Gnostic knowledge. </p>

<p>Imagined if another whole being, an enlightened being &quot;fell from heaven&quot;, or you know, lowered his frequency to come help, and his parts were also humans, same as us, some black, white, red, green, you know what I mean, then suddenly its mission was forgotten because all the parts of the other dude were sexy, violent, aggressive, thieving, but on the other hand had the ability to be docile, loving, willingness to share, it fucked with their heads and they became fuckheads and the whole realized he is fucked because all his parts have to come into some type of something, frequency, same ideologies, idk, in order for him to increase his frequency again and ascend the hell away from this whole mess. </p>

<p>In the end, the being that came to help became corrupted, and its corruption has had more effects on us in a positive way, sadly its going to boil down to the world almost burning, enlightened blindmen hiding in tunnels, and us finally realizing we didn&#39;t need anything but each other. </p>

<p>No matter who the person, they want to feel a connection with something, we were never a high being, we were lower and we are evolving, and the higher being who came down pretty much fucked himself sadly by trying to help, or being sent here to help, maybe he has his own mission once we are gone? </p>

<p>Many criminals go back to gang life because there is no family, no connection with anyone besides their homies, their homies will be there for them, they will give them food, they will give them a roof over there head, they will tell them what they want to hear when they need to hear it, its heartbreaking but its the truth. Obviously there may be some outliers here, but most criminals, if not nearly all of them, love their mother, its a person they always feel a connection with, this is why friends who will actually tell you the truth to your face, even if its an ugly truth (I don&#39;t mean like &quot;That makes you look fat&quot;, unless asked, I mean &quot;You are looking very thin and for the last few months I notice your not eating properly and its a sign of depression and starvation, what is wrong&quot; (this happened, friend didn&#39;t respond, I didn&#39;t press, he ate kraft dinner that night so no reason to press on).</p>

<p>It is likely we are not very important, we are individual, and it is very likely we have souls that will live on in some fashion with us keeping sometype of consciousness but I believe those that ascend through negative vibrations/or positive vibrations (I believe their is likely a path on both ends of the spectrum, it sounds more like the positive vibrations is a hard concept for a higher being to grasp, maybe it has focused on the negative vibration end of the spectrum in order to attempt to get its parts to &quot;ascend&quot; again. </p>

<p>My theory is that we as parts, and as a whole, are likely EXTREMELY interesting, with this theory I present, we have corrupted an ascended being who came to aid us, and in this process, their corruption is slowly dividing us apart to a point where their will be nothing left to divide with and we will see through all the divisions, and we will see all that is, us. </p>

<p>I like this, I should write a fucking book or something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if psychics &quot;knew&quot; that reality operates on a level above the baseline we experience as day to day life. What if they structure their beliefs in a way to walk around the outside of yours/majority. And the way those beliefs are strucured in their minds gives them more freedom than you allow yourself? Who&#39;s to say what is and what isn&#39;t, but you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a very good point. I hadn&#39;t ever thought about it like that. I&#39;m a firm believer in that there is different levels of &quot;reality&quot; if you will. </p>

<p>I&#39;m actually listening to a podcast right now where they are talking about a woman who can &quot;see&quot; entities that attach themselves to people to feed off of them. Very similar to the Gnostic beliefs about the Archons.</p>

<p>So...in her &quot;reality&quot; she can see these entities. If someone is deaf, there reality is silence, blind people&#39;s reality is darkness etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not foolish enough to dismiss those stories of people who can see things yet I don&#39;t structure my views on them either. I take what I can from a variety of sources and realize that it just adds to the picture of what we really are experiencing. </p>

<p>This is such a mysterious and beautiful existence...just cherish every minute because we never know when it could be gone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s pretty sweet... And it&#39;s just regular old boring everyday &quot;reality&quot; that holds our attention so tight &amp; is ignored in day to day mundane life. There be all manner of mechanisms running the show just outside the corners of your belief structure. It&#39;s actually more like a safety so you don&#39;t see to much and go nuts, but to the brave go the spoils.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If i had to guess...I can see how the brain breaks down external stimuli into things that can be experienced via sensory organs into deciperable electrical signals in the brain. Which creates my &quot;reality experience&quot; for a particuliar event.

And this makes me wonder if the way that things are explained to us may make a fundemental difference in our ability to recognize and identify any changes that aren&#39;t identified by society at large.
