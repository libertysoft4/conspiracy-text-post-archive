She never told a soul till 2012 and even then never mentioned Brett Kavanaughs name in the therapy notes until she sent that secret anonymous letter to the Democrats whom never mentioned it once to Brett during his private interviews and live television interviews. </p>

<p>So why is it she can’t remember key details but she remembers a witness after never mentioning this to a soul named Mark Judge whom just happens to be a published author where you can cite his books as “evidence”. Which is what I’ve already seen people on the internet doing.  </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter to me whether a man is Republican or Democrat. I have a problem with women who wait years before speaking out. This includes Harvey Weinstein. I have a problem with all those women who waited years before speaking out against him. Many of them clearly benefited by staying silent.</p>

<p>Regardless the problem is that they feel pressured to stay silent for fear of retribution, right? These women feel afraid to speak out therefore they don’t. The whole idea of the movement is to help victims feel less social pressure allowing them the opportunity to speak out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When shit like that comes up, I always think CIA disinfo immediately. It&#39;s just another &quot;trutherism&quot;, like what happened to the 9/11 investigations. They see people with legit questions or a verifiable incident gaining traction, they gotta send out &quot;distraction artists&quot; to flood out the real deal. So you take a bunch of unrelated incidents, both false and real, and staple them together then give it a hashtag (hmm, that sounds like something I heard before too, say around August 2014?) to derail support of the people who were definitely onto something. (How convenient it exploded the way it did after the DiGra link to DARPA sociological experiments was found....)</p>

<p>Say, why did Richard Spencer gain international MSM-constructed notoriety from out of nowhere despite his lack of &quot;activism record&quot; or anyone listening to his podcasts other than his mom, again?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I currently work in survivor support. It frequently takes years or decades for people who have been abused to come forward.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t come forward immediately because they&#39;re often ashamed of what has happened to them (even blaming themselves); afraid of not being believed (and/or being attacked or derided by their communities); and because the adversarial legal process is pretty much guaranteed to be an awful experience for them even if the perpetrator isn&#39;t comparatively powerful (which they frequently are).</p>

<p>Comments in this thread are pretty much a case in point. </p>

<p>I can also see some familiar names in here who would be very accepting of abuse claims (albeit without accusers/victims), and accepting of a much lower standard of evidence and testimony when it aligns with their political ideology.</p>

<p>As for the rest of it, you&#39;re not hearing them out by jumping the gun on this.  Its only just started, and this is politics.  It&#39;s foolish to back the accuser 100% right off the bat because people have been traumatized.  That can be faked, or more accurately, it can be bought.</p>

<p>You&#39;re all over this thread saying you support the accuser, but....you have to know you cannot know for sure.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Traumatized or not, her case would not get standing in court, because in court the burden of evidence is on the accuser. If she accuses Kavanaugh of sexual harrasment, it&#39;s on her to bring sufficient evidence to court. And there&#39;s good reason for this practice, as proving a negative is almost always impossible.</p>

<p>In this case, they went with the court of public opinion, and that doesn&#39;t have these pesky rigorous standards for evidence. She can accuse all she wants and Kavanaugh can&#39;t defend himself. I think it&#39;s obvious for the neutral observer that her actions were not the right way of dealing with this, trauma or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe her. </p>

<p>Firstly, on her not remembering the exact date or place, that’s not a problem for me. I’m younger than Ford, and I don’t remember basically any specific dates or places from my teen years. For example, I know how old I was when I first had sex, and I remember some hilarious embarrassing details, but I don’t know what month it was, or exactly where it happened. It makes perfect sense to me that she wouldn’t talk about it much, too. It was obviously a traumatic event, but she did get away, and Kavanaugh is only recently a household name.</p>

<p>Beyond that, there’s just no good reason for her to make this up. She’s a successful professional with a family, and she knew that if this went public it would turn her life upside down, and it has. If Kavanaugh didn’t attack her, then she doesn’t have any more personal stake in Kavanaugh’s appointment than I do, and I know I wouldn’t come forward with a false accusation and jeopardize everything I have.</p>

<p>You can make an argument that the Democrats are cynically using this to their advantage, but I don’t think there’s a strong argument to be made that Ford herself is being dishonest. Anyway, none of this should change anyone’s mind in the Grab Them By the Pussy Era.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not remembering events is one thing but this lady accused a innocent man of a crime. All to stop his confirmation.

Why is Mark Judge the only person she remembers whom just happens to talk about his sex life in his books? </p>

<p>There is plenty of good reasons for her to make this up. She would be a hero to the Leftists and Democrat Elites who hate Trump if she successfully stops or stalls his nomination long enough for midterms. And she would get her own Book signing deals and a appearance on 60 minutes. She’s already profited heavily thanks to GoFundMe by making $90,000 to a case with almost no details. </p>

<p>She’s also demanding Kavanaugh not be in the room and that he goes 1st. If Brett was Drunk like she claims he was it’s actually her duty to refresh his memory. </p>

<p>Because he actively participated in the assault.</p>

<p>Friend, that is not profiting heavily. $90k is not enough to deal with doxxing and death threats, not by a long shot. Personally I’m not sure you could offer me enough money to put my family in danger.</p>

<p>No. A victim of sexual assault does not have a “duty” to refresh her attacker’s memory. That’s completely arbitrary.</p>

<p>What she’s going to do, hopefully, is tell her story. Kavanaugh, probably, will contradict her. We and the Senate Judiciary Committee will all have to weigh both stories and decide which we think is more likely: that Ford, a respected university professor who passed a polygraph test, is telling the truth about a painful and all-too-common sexual assault that occurred when she was fifteen years old; or that she’s a liar who out of the blue decided now was a good time to risk her career and family to derail a Supreme Court nominee and maybe get a book deal. I know which story I think is more plausible.</p>

<p>There is no statute of limitations on attempted rape in Maryland. It is a criminal case, though, so there would still be no legal cost to Ford. The costs she’s paying are psychological. And, she probably has to hire security now.</p>
