        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have an iPhone SE, I bought something at Walgreens tonight and it was on my Instagram ads. I don’t normally buy the item.
The other day I said I liked a child’s cup and it was on my Facebook ads. The obvious answer is get off social media first.
The phone is obviously listening. It isn’t a new concept. But the item I never buy, a cup I compliment, my husband’s searches popping up for my ads? I connected my husband’s searches easily, the other two made me more curious about how this really works.</p>

<p>What are the apps and services connecting to share this information specifically? So easily? Not that anything should be trusted but what is worse... Open Facebook app? Amazon, debit card? Bank apps? How do they know the specifics? What is the best you can do now to protect your privacy? Are any phones safer than others? How can we protect ourselves now that it’s already this far along? I understand the ability of technology more than the technicalities, any insight or direction is appreciated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Facebook is a primary culprit. But please understand that both main manufacturers of smart phones, Google and Apple are capturing user data. Think of everything you ever did on your phone goobled up and stored. Everything google&#39;d, called, texted, gps&#39;d, picture, all of it captured. </p>

<p>Your usage and interactions help to create &quot;map&quot; of an individual. Selfies provide facial recognition data, its blatantly obvious. We are at the cusp of biometric capturing via smartphones, with the heavy adoption of fingerprint scanners. </p>

<p>Just think of a giant spider web. You can think of the sinister side or pull down the wool, look at the bright side, and enjoy the convenience this system provides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a standard <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> post. Left this kind of response before. PSA basically In any case.</p>

<p>Even if you secure your phone completely. That is easy enough. Faraday cage, a multi player one, and if possible no battery inside. Still nothing you can do.</p>

<p>Want to feel just slightly better, keep the cameras covered when not in use. Reusable stickers are great for this. Added bonus maybe, your lens wont get scratched.</p>

<p>Everyone around you is filling in your gap though. Their phones still watch and listen to you, and everything else.</p>

<p>I have heard of technologies that use wifi, are a part of wifi, to map a room in great detail. Revealing where all kinds of things are. Things not on camera, or in ear shot. Things that are behind walls that you could only see if you ripped the wall out. &quot;X-ray vision,&quot; basically.</p>

<p>Mind you there are all kinds of other sensors in phones. Heart rate monitor, temperature and humidity sensors, highly sensitive gyroscopes, magnetometer, etc. It&#39;s a lie detector too basically.</p>

<p>In short, not only are we constantly being recorded in every way possible. Essentially we are also being interrogated the entire time as well.</p>

<p>We have lived in a grand prison for a long time. This is simply an elaboration on that process.</p>

<p>My advice to you all is to be highly mindful of your thoughts, words, and actions. There are so many forces trying to force you to think, and act out certain ways. Enticing you away from thinking critically by keeping you out of rational states. They leverage all manner of physiological manipulation based off of human biology, that takes a great deal of effort to avoid.  Fear, sex, anger, love, etc. Any thing they can do to keep us from thinking, from questioning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your response. We really do need to guard our heart, mind and soul- more than ever from the invasive. I understand our privacy has been threatened for a very long time. I agree it’s a prison. But I can’t understand, is it just people are unconcerned? Are that many unaware? Do we just not understand the gravity of this? We’re just powerless? I used to cover my camera sometimes. I’m just constantly lulled into the feeling that I’ve already done it for so long/they already know/everyone else does it. But I use the camera, I see these ads and I know that I feel totally sick about it when it’s nonstop and in my face. Is that just me? Our relationships are so screwed too. I know whatever technology they have is only escalating. Do you just try to enjoy? Maybe separate and really live as much as possible? I am glad I’m not someone who posts my schedule on Facebook or anything... but carrying the phone around without FB, is still just as bad at this point, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are both unconcerned and unaware. They are unconcerned because they think if they are doing wrong they have nothing to fear. Not the case, because everyone&#39;s freedom is being infringed and everyone&#39;s privacy has being infringed. The noose is slowly tightening around everyone&#39;s neck.</p>

<p>At the same time most people are genuinely unaware of how deep this goes, and all the long term implications. In essence what&#39;s happening is that your personal life, information, no longer belongs to you, but to multiple various third parties. At any time, any information, can be used against you as blackmail. To stop you from doing something wrong sure, but also to coerce you into doing something wrong. For example, acting as a patsy for some greater nefarious entity.</p>

<p>As to what we can do, it&#39;s limited to Faraday cages, pulling batteries, covering cameras. Which at best, is only half the battle. Avoid the web completely whenever, especially non-anonymous web traffic. Stay away from cameras, mics, and any kind of wifi. That&#39;s a loosing battle ultimately, unless you go and live in a cave or something extreme.</p>

<p>The mindfulness really is the most important part. Always ask you self, why you are having the thoughts you are having. The advertising is subtle and subliminal. Every aspect of the web, and media, is becoming hyper-personalized. To sell to you, sell you to others, and manipulate you. At this point we have to assume that every bit of information you see on a screen or hear, contains a hidden message to coerce our thinking.</p>

<p>FB, R, I, T, etc. are problems certainly, but they are not the main problem. It&#39;s more the people who are using the information gathered from those sources. Those are the groups with the power to really use that information.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a brave new world we live in.</p>

You said you don’t normally buy the item, but if you have purchased it in the past then there will be a record of it.
