    <div class="md"><p>i am not too familiar with the story, but i think that a totalitarian police state cant allow the existence of uncontrolled/independent/unassimilated groups such as the branch davidians were.  so it was an immune reaction of the empire.</p>

<p>also, i heard in the conspiracy circles, that the massacre was actually a satanic or pagan sacrifice by the powers that shouldnt be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can buy the &quot;Clinton is a rapist / criminal&quot; narrative, based on his dealings in Arkansas. Janet Reno being a dyke is a complete non-sequitur. The whole concept of a Deep State has been co-opted by the mainstream media and shills/hoaxers. And, of course, the (co-opted) Deep State / Illuminati are satanists, (which sounds like a Bible-Belter&#39;s fantasy to me) even though religion is a fairy tale and any serious minded elite knows that it is solely a means for controlling the population and the ideas therein.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I followed this while it was going on, through message boards.  The groups attorney was putting out frequent statements, as well as other people who were trying to report on it.</p>

<p>Sorry if my recollection isn&#39;t spot on.</p>

<p>The basic gist was that there was a someone in govt trying to force an underage ( family member / friend ) out of the group.  There had been multiple accusations of abuse, none of which would stick.  The group was heavily armed, but again, it was investigated and came up legit.</p>

<p>So they arranged a raid.  In theory, it was supposed to be in and out, overwhelming force.  The Branch Davidians got wind of it, knew they were coming, and had trained specifically to defend their compound from this type of attack.</p>

<p>So the raid turned into a siege.  This is where I think the real funny business happened.</p>

<p>At this point, I think that the ringmasters decided to find out how much they could get away with, and how well they could control the narrative.  They brought hell on Earth to Waco, for months, and found out that they could do anything they wanted if they could control the press.  </p>

<p>I think it was a mistake that turned into an opportunity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Janet reno decided to murder 80 or so innocent Texans to prove a point. The atf was serving a search warrant to check for illegal weapons. Several times the residents offered to have their products inspected as they were licensed firearms dealers. </p>

<p>No no, can&#39;t have that. We needed Janet reno to pull out automatic black rifles to pass the Clinton crime bill. </p>

<p>In the end They pumped the compound full of flammable tear gas and watched it burn. Some time back there was a documentary that even showed gunfire coming from the vehicles preventing people from escaping</p>

<p>If you read the account from ruby ridge around the same time it&#39;s even more depressing </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe Netflix had a serious that dramatized and was basically factual regarding the event.  Government is always trying to establish its self as all powerful and refuses to brook/tolerate any insubordination.  The Branch Davidians were insubordinate and refused to knuckle under.   The Civil War started the process of Federalization with a strong central government dictating to the citizenry the rules.   Currently, Federalism is ebbing with States and locales challenging federal government rules.  Events like Waco are hallmarks in the struggle between what the government wants and what the citizens want.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unsure if Netflix had anything, but <a href="http://www.paramountnetwork.com/shows/waco">Paramount Network</a> had a six part Mini-Series dramatization that was well cast and acted. Very engaging, and I’d highly recommend it (though you should recognize that it paints some people in a positive light that maybe shouldn’t be viewed so positively). Good television, but it is a dramatization after all. </p>

<p>Episode one starts out with Ruby Ridge as a catalyst for Waco, suggesting that the events of Waco were prompted by ATF/FBI trying to get a big bust to reinforce the public perception that they do Good for Americans. </p>

<p>If Netflix has something else I think I’d like to see it. </p>

Posting about the government trying to encourage one to become an informant through dastardly means, did you see the story on the individual who was placed on the no fly list, sued the government, was taken off the list, however, he continued his law suit and a Federal District Judge ruled he has standing to continue with the suit. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You may recall the 90s was full of anti government militancy, concern over globalization, NAFTA, extraordinary distrust, in general what you would expect of citizens in an empire with no apparent external threat ... the cold war had ended</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the Soviet Union fell, people expected their lives to get better. They didn&#39;t. Instead, they got economic stagnation, encroachments on civil rights, and increasingly violent government (look into what they did at Ruby Ridge, where an FBI sniper murdered a nursing mother with a baby in he rhands).</p>

<p>You had people that understood the situation, like Bill Cooper, becoming increasingly popular and waking millions of people up. Militias become increasingly popular.</p>

<p>So, they struck back. Murdered everyone at Waco. Oklahoma City false flag. Later, 9/11 to bring everyone into line and create a new cold war with Islamic terrorism (which was all created by the CIA).</p>

<p>Why target Koresh? For one thing, he was an ardent <a href="http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1993/eirv20n22-19930604/eirv20n22-19930604_065-baylor_university_aided_fbi_in_w.pdf">anti-freemason</a>, and they saw this movement as a threat to their power. There were also rumors that Koresh had worked for the government, possibly on MK Ultra experiments or training, but turned against them.</p>

<p>Branch Davidians were able to see a CIA air strip from their compound, and they had video footage of kids going in and out of military transport planes.</p>

<p>Waco was about Pedogate. Clinton and Reno massacred Koresh, destroyed the compound and smeared Koresh as a pedo in order to send a message to all future underground railroad networks and anyone else working to stop CIA human trafficking.</p>
