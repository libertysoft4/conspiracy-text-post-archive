        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Almost every country can become energy independent. Anywhere that has sunlight and land can produce alcohol from plants. Brazil, the fifth largest country in the world imports no oil, since half its cars run on alcohol fuel made from sugarcane, grown on 1% of its land.</p>

<p>We can reverse global warming. Since alcohol is made from plants, its production takes carbon dioxide out of the air, sequestering it, with the result that it reverses the greenhouse effect (while potentially vastly improving the soil). Recent studies show that in a permaculturally designed mixed-crop alcohol fuel production system, the amount of greenhouse gases removed from the atmosphere by plants—and then exuded by plant roots into the soil as sugar—can be 13 times what is emitted by processing the crops and burning the alcohol in our cars.</p>

<p>We can revitalize the economy instead of suffering through Peak Oil. Oil is running out, and what we replace it with will make a big difference in our environment and economy. Alcohol fuel production and use is clean and environmentally sustainable, and will revitalize families, farms, towns, cities, industries, as well as the environment. A national switch to alcohol fuel would provide many millions of new permanent jobs.</p>

<p>No new technological breakthroughs are needed. We can make alcohol fuel out of what we have, where we are. Alcohol fuel can efficiently be made out of many things, from waste products like stale donuts, grass clippings, food processing waste-even ocean kelp. Many crops produce many times more alcohol per acre than corn, using arid, marshy, or even marginal land in addition to farmland. Just our lawn clippings could replace a third of the autofuel we get from the Mideast.</p>

<p>Unlike hydrogen fuel cells, we can easily use alcohol fuel in the vehicles we already own. Unmodified cars can run on 50% alcohol, and converting to 100% alcohol or flexible fueling (both alcohol and gas) costs only a few hundred dollars. Most auto companies already sell new dual-fuel vehicles.</p>

<p>Alcohol is a superior fuel to gasoline! It’s 105 octane, burns much cooler with less vibration, is less flammable in case of accident, is 98% pollution-free, has lower evaporative emissions, and deposits no carbon in the engine or oil, resulting in a tripling of engine life. Specialized alcohol engines can get at least 22% better mileage than gasoline or diesel.</p>

<p>It’s not just for gasoline cars. We can also easily use alcohol fuel to power diesel engines, trains, aircraft, small utility engines, generators to make electricity, heaters for our homes—and it can even be used to cook our food.</p>

<p>Alcohol has a proud history. Gasoline is a refinery’s toxic waste; alcohol fuel is liquid sunshine. Henry Ford’s early cars were all flex-fuel. It wasn’t until gasoline magnate John D. Rockefeller funded Prohibition that alcohol fuel companies were driven out of business.</p>

<p>The byproducts of alcohol production are clean, instead of being oil refinery waste, and are worth more than the alcohol itself. In fact, they can make petrochemical fertilizers and herbicides obsolete. The alcohol production process concentrates and makes more digestible all protein and non-starch nutrients in the crop. It’s so nutritious that when used as animal feed, it produces more meat or milk than the corn it comes from. That’s right, fermentation of corn increases the food supply and lowers the cost of food.</p>

<p>Locally produced ethanol supercharges regional economies. Instead of fuel expenditures draining capital away to foreign bank accounts, each gallon of alcohol produces local income that gets recirculated many times. Every dollar of tax credit for alcohol generates up to $6 in new tax revenues from the increased local business.</p>

<p>Alcohol production brings many new small-scale business opportunities. There is huge potential for profitable local, integrated, small-scale businesses that produce alcohol and related byproducts, whereas when gas was cheap, alcohol plants had to be huge to make a profit.</p>

<p>Scale matters—most of the widely publicized potential problems with ethanol are a function of scale. Once production plants get beyond a certain size and are too far away from the crops that supply them, closing the ecological loop becomes problematic. Smaller-scale operations can more efficiently use a wide variety of crops than huge specialized one-crop plants, and diversification of crops would largely eliminate the problems of monoculture.</p>

<p>The byproducts of small-scale alcohol plants can be used in profitable, energy-efficient, and environmentally positive ways. For instance, spent mash (the liquid left over after distillation) contains all the nutrients the next fuel crop needs and can return it back to the soil if the fields are close to the operation. Big-scale plants, because they bring in crops from up to 45 miles away, can’t do this, so they have to evaporate all the water and sell the resulting byproduct as low-price animal feed,which accounts for half the energy used in the plant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to start with, I agree, alcohol engines would be great.</p>

<p>But..</p>

<p>When yeast produce alcohol they excrete co2,  probably more than it took to grow them after adjusting for natural amounts. </p>

<p>If you cut back on co2 you will actually inhibit the growth of plants. They thrive on that shit. </p>

<p>But also gasoline engines produce more torque than alcohol engines, they are not the same. </p>

<p>Would like to see more electric and alcohol engines, but the things you are saying about the situation aren&#39;t really true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My pessimism comes from the fact that we already have better alternatives (battery powered vehicles) to any liquid fuel varieties. Why would we invest billions into updating or cars to run on alcohol, when we already have the technology available to us to eliminate fossil fuels (and liquid fuels) entirely. Electric powered vehicles are equally efficient and environmentally friendly. And they don&#39;t require thousands of acres dedicated to fermenting tanks to produce energy for them. I&#39;d rather have a outlet in my garage then a massive fermenting vat in my backyard to &quot;fuel&quot; my car. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a problem though, you can do electrolysis with very little electricity if you want too but you also have to have a certain rate of production in order for it to be usable as an energy source. Hydrogen is very hard to store in containers as it is the smallest element and will escape from just about any container you store it in. You would have to overcome the rate of release which means increasing electrolysis rates which means more energy used. You also have to exceed the consumption rate of which ever thing is consuming it which further increases the required energy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alcohol is an awful fuel thanks to it&#39;s extremely low energy content, the damage it does to combustion engines, it&#39;s lack of ability to pipeline to locations, it&#39;s absorption of water, and it pollutes far more than standard fuels. </p>

<p>A fuels energy comes from the amount of carbon chains it has, the more carbon chains the more energy rich it is. Alcohol has about half as much energy as gasoline and diesel fuel. Alcohol has an energy density of 21.2 MJ/L and 26.8 MJ/kg, Gasoline has an energy density of 34.8 MJ/L and 44.4 MJ/kg, and Diesel is at 38.6 MJ/L and 45.4 MJ/kg. This means you have to use a lot more of it to get the same amount of work out of your vehicle as you would with regular fuel. It results in worse MPG and range. Ethanol is also heavier than gasoline so it will also weigh down your vehicle more than gasoline, but this gets worse thanks to ethanol&#39;s tendency to absorb moisture which will increase weight further while also causing damage to your vehicle as water cannot be compressed which results in greater stress.</p>

<p>Ethanol will also damage numerous other parts of a standard vehicle thanks to it reacting to various materials that normally wouldn&#39;t be damaged by standard fuel. Some materials are great at resisting oil based solvents and bad at resisting alcohol based solvents. This usually results in greater maintenance frequency. Most modern vehicles are perfectly fine with using alcohol though as they can sense the energy output and adjust the systems accordingly but they do require some work to fully utilize alcohol in the most efficient way possible.</p>

<p>Alcohol transportation is also a major problem as it cannot be sent through a pipeline as it will pickup moisture as well as impurities resulting in a requirement to distill it again. This means that it&#39;s expensive to transport it to fuel stations since you would need to send it by train or truck. If it were to be sent through pipeline, we would need massive amounts of new pipelines since you can&#39;t use the ones already in place but also because the ethanol production is in different areas of the country usually much further away from infrastructure.</p>

<p>Alcohol use also pollutes a lot more than standard gasoline which is surprising to a lot of people. This increase in pollution is due to that lack of energy density and required increased fuel consumption. It pollutes about 54% more than gasoline.</p>

<p>There is also a number of other problems with using alcohol as a fuel with the major one being it&#39;s production. Ethanol production needs biomass to occur. This biomass needs a significant amount of land space in order to grow which decreases the land space that is available for food production. The biomass also uses primarily human food sources i/e corn, potatoes, sugar beets, sugar cane etc... This results in a increase in food prices as there is less available crops to make food from.</p>

<p>All of these various problems results in making alcohol not viable as a petroleum based fuel alternative. There are a number of other alternative energy sources that are far better suited for it however. I actually wrote a research proposal on this subject as my capstone project for my first bachelors degree. I attempted to find the most viable alternative renewable fuel source and focused on 3 different fuels all of which could be produced from biomass in a similar manner as ethanol while having none of the same problems. I used biomass&#39;s that were easily obtained due to there being no current market use. They are primarily thrown out as waste or sent to landfills and cannot be easily consumed by humans. They also were drought resistant and could be grown in just about any climate. All byproducts of the production also had significant market uses meaning there was little to no waste. The fuels that I chose also result in significantly lower emissions given off than standard fuels. I only needed to find out possible production rates for my fuels by calculating the growth rate of the biomass, and rate of processing to obtain the final fuels. I couldn&#39;t do it myself as I needed to have land and a lot of equipment to do so, which resulted in my research not being finalized. My theories however were echoed and affirmed by other researchers a few years after my proposal was sent in which was great to see. Just wish I could have finished the research myself as I wasn&#39;t given any credit for the work although it&#39;s doubtful my work was stolen by those other colleges.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean the major part of my entire comment was about alternative fuels and addressing why alcohol is the worst choice. I don&#39;t know how you could get anything other than me being pro alternative fuels. Alcohol is just the worst choice for alternative fuels because of all the numerous problems it has with it but mostly because of how little energy it actually has in it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My pessimism comes from the fact that we already have better alternatives (battery powered vehicles) to any liquid fuel varieties. Why would we invest billions into updating or cars to run on alcohol, when we already have the technology available to us to eliminate fossil fuels (and liquid fuels) entirely. Electric powered vehicles are equally efficient and environmentally friendly. And they don&#39;t require thousands of acres dedicated to fermenting tanks to produce energy for them. I&#39;d rather have a outlet in my garage then a massive fermenting vat in my backyard to &quot;fuel&quot; my car. </p>
