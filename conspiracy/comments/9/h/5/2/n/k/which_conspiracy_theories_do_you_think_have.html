    <div class="md"><p>similar examples is not the same thing as proof. like I say I&#39;ve looked for it for years and never found anything indicating clear unambiguous support, funding or provision of arms to bin lade / al-Qaeda...those guys were ALWAYS hostile to the west - their spiritual leader is Sayyid Qutb who was preaching against the west as far back as the 50&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you not heard of USSR invading Afghanistan, and the US arming of Afghan populace to fight back? But mainly the forces that were fighting against the USSR were middle east men from other Countries?<br/>
Then the US arming of these &quot;Rebels&quot; to stop the invasion. This group was lead by Osama Bin Laden.<br/>
They have made IDK how many psy-opt movies talking about this very setup. Hell even Rambo Movies got into the mix.<br/>
Harts War to name another.   </p>

<p>They may have had different names, but they are the same, and have been for years. The Iran Contra deal was a major part of this later on too.   </p>

<p>There is a little more background for you. Look it up. Find your proof. Hell even WikiPedia knows. Read between the lines for the real answers.   </p>

As you know Al Qaeda means &#39;the base&#39;, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/jul/08/july7.development">well in a 2005 article</a> Robin Cook, former speaker of the House of Commons claims Al Qaeda was the name of the file that listed all of the CIA&#39;s mujahedin assets in Afghanistan. It&#39;s database. </p>

<p>You also would have came across Salem Bin Laden in your 18 years of research as well. The former head of the CIA Bin Laden unit Michael Scheuer himself has said 600 million of the agencies funds have passed through OBL&#39;s charity fronts the most prolific being MAK. </p>

<p>Salem Bin Laden was GWB&#39;s business partner. The Bush&#39;s and the Bin Laden&#39;s are old family friends. You do remember that GHWB is a former CIA director? But you&#39;re right, laughable</p>

<ol>
<li>US supplied Afghan fighters with weapons and training.</li>
<li>These fighters after the Afghan/Soviet war started Terror Training Camps (Al Queda)</li>
<li>The leader was Osama Bin Laden (A well known CIA asset)</li>
<li>The other leader of this group was Bagdadi (IDK the spelling and not looking it up)</li>
<li>The Bagdadi group left Afghanistan and went to Iraq under the protection of another CIA asset Saddam Hussein. </li>
<li>This 2nd group later formed ISIS. </li>
<li>ISIS left Iraq and started fighting in Syria with the help of US (CIA) supplying weapons and support. </li>

It should be no surprise that we continue to do so. That is what got NoName justice.  </p>

<p>There is a ton of info around about all of this. Various boards various resources. This is something that I was into over 12 years ago, and not much into since. I am probably completely wrong about Bagdadi working directly with OBL, and in fact was a different person. But ISIS/Al Queda and OBL work in concert with each other to destabilize the area. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;ve used pizzagate as a catch all for the whole VIP paedo ring &#39;conspiracy&#39; tbh...there definitely IS substance to THAT. i knw people who were victims...and i knew them for years before i accidentally found out. and it&#39;s NOT something that they want to talk about...i know when someone&#39;s lying to me and seeing a 50 odd yr old man suddenly burst into tears is not something that screams bullshit.</p>

<p>but as for the specifics of pizzagate itself? there is something there but i&#39;m not as informed on it to really judge how or what or who...</p>

<p>take out the fakes...take out the military aircraft...take out the drones...take out the odd weather...and you are indeed left with evidence of UAP.</p>

<p>but there&#39;s no conspiracy behind it...where that comes in is with the black military projects etc...</p>

<p>my opinion on UAP is we simply don&#39;t know...I don&#39;t think it&#39;s &#39;aliens&#39;...it may be demons lol...idk...but something has been there in the skies since history began to be recorded. I&#39;ve got pretty much everything written in that field...it&#39;s what got me into conspiracy research in the first place...and that came from my old fella who was obsessed with back in the day.</p>

<p>commonly available drones of today were probably being tested by the military 30 / 40 years ago...so i generally discount most of those sightings. The phoenix lights for example look like a classic drone formation.</p>

<p>Some of your substantial claims are in fact laughable and some of your laughable claims easily substantial.</p>

<p>Maybe laughable is the wrong term. Maybe less believable or researched?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude it wasnt a dick measuring post. and it wasnt supposed to have logical threads...simply how i feel about things...Montauk for example is incredibly out there...and there&#39;s little actual substance...i just &#39;feel&#39; there&#39;s something there.</p>

<p>sandy hook is clearly no conspiracy tho...i find that offensive...and i fail to see any reason for that conspiracy....i guess if one of the kids had seen something / been abused....i guess...but no. </p>

<p>&#39;Maybe laughable is the wrong term. Maybe less believable or researched?&#39;</p>

<p>in most cases i&#39;d say the opposite...the more i&#39;ve researched some of these the less i find them credible.</p>

<p>with the absolute glaring exception of the VIP / Elite paedophile stories...the more i see on that the worse it gets and the more it makes me see things in a different. for example - Theresa May is the PM because she was Home Secretary when a lot of the evidence bubbled up....18 months later and from outta nowhere she&#39;s Prime Minister and the abuse inquiry slowly dissolves to nothing!? </p>

<p>Sandy Hook</p>

<p>Moon Landings</p>

<p>Denver airport</p>

<p>Other than that, I pretty much line up with you on the rest of them. I can shoot you some sources on those other topics if interested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks dude...and yeah I fully expected the downvotes. all I want is the truth and if that messes up my paradigms then so be it. it&#39;s pretty obvious to me that the Zodiac killer is a hoax...there&#39;s no evidence linking any of the crimes together, the letters are all different etc etc...yet go to the zodiac sub and try and tell em that! only time I&#39;ve ever reached double figures in downvotes!</p>

<p>i&#39;ll look into those again then...and yeah I&#39;d be very interested in the sources you mention. just don&#39;t see what the motivation would be for sandy hook...I don&#39;t buy the gun control thing...but I will look closer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh there&#39;s definitely substance to that!</p>

<p>the jonny gosch linkage is bullshit tho...danny heinreich killed him...i think bonacci was either a victim who used the media interest around Goschs case to protect himself or he was a victim brainwashed into being a patsy to make the linkage and so take the spotlight away from the actual case.</p>

<p>but yeah...Franklins the real shit. i dont have time right now but it&#39;s my positiion that that case has links to the Atlanta child murders...OCCK...Marc Dutroux....</p>
