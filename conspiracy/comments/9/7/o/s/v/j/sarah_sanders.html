<p>The point is, I have the utmost respect for this woman&#39;s dedication to her craft. Sure she is a member of the Trump admin. But her ability to defend Trump in those briefings is superb and I  have yet to see her seriously misstep. Even when she is being &quot;undermined&quot; by Trump only moments after a briefing, she comes back in good fashion. I admire her ability to use words for spin and misdirection, which may not be as easy as you would think given how quickly she responds.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is that if I had a spokesperson, it would be her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The definition inherently emphasizes the positive. But press relations in actuality is simple the relationship with the press, regardless of what shape that takes.</p>

<p>I am of the opinion that if the questions were seen less as aggressive posturing from the press, she would be in a position to more frequently make people more aware of the president stance. Also, her just saying &quot;the president had made his stance clear&quot; is the perfect answer regardless for Trump, Obama or anyone. It means that there is nothing further that needs to be said for it speaks for itself. She is not required to give you anything more unless dictated otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You want aggressive questions. That’s the job of the press. I understand she isn’t obligated to reply but in order to keep good faith she shouldn’t lie and that’s the biggest issue imo. Don’t answer or read the a direct statement from the president before you tell a falsehood. That’s why imo she and those before her in the administration are not great press secretary’s. She is definitely better the the ones before her but she still suffers from the simple fact that Trump puts them in a position to lie for him. </p>

You are right it doesn&#39;t matter if I put up a disclaimer <em>as</em> <em>it</em> <em>relates</em> to the rules of the sub. I state reading is fundemental because I state the obvious that this is not a conspiracy. The blatant ignorance if any is on your part. Simply report the post to the mod. But to say that the post is not a conspiracy, when I state it isn&#39;t a conspiracy, is redundant. Down vote, move on, report, or contribute you opinion on the topic.

I did report you to the mods, I did downvote, and i commented because people like you piss me off fucking deal with. I did contribute my opinion. You&#39;re reading comprehension skills are a little off, I pointed out that you were posting in a conspiracy thread without a present conspiracy but the bulk of my comment had to do with your stupid fucking &quot;Reading is fundamental&quot; responses like some fucking entitled little child. Because you blatantly posted into a sub the rest of us come to for fucking conspiracies. Not just your everyday run of the mill off the cuff comment. I dont give two fucks what you think unless it pertains to this sub. It&#39;s not facebook page. Dont be a social parasite and you wont be treated as such.  </p>
