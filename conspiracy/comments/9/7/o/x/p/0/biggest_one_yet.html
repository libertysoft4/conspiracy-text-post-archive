        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello, my name... Is not important right now..  Time is of the essence..  I need to make the most of it, and to make that happen.. I need you, yes you the individuals of reddit.  </p>

<p>Two years ago I tried psylocybin mushrooms for the first time and it was the most eye opening experience I ever imagined...  </p>

<p>Fast forward two years and I started getting into tripping again..  </p>

<p>My personality type is INTP, I realize most don&#39;t understand what that means so I&#39;m going to give you a resource to do that...</p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/p8i6tapaldg11.jpg">https://i.redd.it/p8i6tapaldg11.jpg</a></p>

<p>Now, you know a bit about me hopefully...</p>

<p>But now we can begin..  For centuries people have been obsessed with the idea of a conspiracy.  Why?  Because to us, IT MAKES SENSE!  When someone presents us with a conspiracy, we look at it we see it and we do what every person in existence has done.. We consider the possibility..  But then.. Thoughts, take over... Your thoughts, your own ideas and creations from your head get added to THEIR idea.  A net positive change has been made because of a few simple steps.. An idea was created.. It was presented.. Then it was changed..  This is how humanity has progressed on for centeries.  It&#39;s how we grow, and it&#39;s how we learn.  Not only physically, but more importantly mentally..  Your memory is nothing more then history at heart.  History is happening right now in front of us, it&#39;s playing out live in front of us and what are we doing?  What we always do when we don&#39;t understand something.. Ignore it..  It&#39;s the human way..  Ignorance has plagued mankind&#39;s souls to the point where we don&#39;t do enough of what really matters.. TALK.  We don&#39;t talk, we don&#39;t communicate..  And we can&#39;t.. We&#39;ve been lead to believe that talking inspires emotions such as &quot;cringing&quot; &quot;ackwarness&quot; but at the heart of these emotions is confusion, unknowing.  Not being able to understand... I want to teach you... I want everyone to understand.. But first, I need a platform to make that happen.  So I&#39;m looking to you reddit..  Get the word out, give me a platform.. And I&#39;ll change the world...</p>

<p>Divided we are, together we think, alone we suffer, but together we change...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The master file isn&#39;t an encrypted file.  It&#39;s in my head.  It&#39;s 18 years worth of different inputs.  Different peoples thoughts, their feelings, their side of the story.  I was always labeled as depressed or sad, alone, misunderstood... But at the end of the day those labels meant nothing.  They gave me those labels.  HIGH SCHOOL gave me that label.  When in reality I wanted nothing more then what they wanted.. To SUCCEED in LIFE... For 18 years I&#39;ve watched and waited.. 18 years of being an INTP taking in knowledge gathering information, getting ALL the inputs before making a decision...  I didn&#39;t believe in god, I was an atheist/agnostic for a good spell... WHY?  I didn&#39;t understand the world around me and I couldn&#39;t make sense of it. So I gave myself that label..  But it wasn&#39;t real... that wasn&#39;t the TRUTH.  I had an incomplete part of a WHOLE puzzle.  After highschool I thought the same feeling that many in my generation felt.. NOW WHAT?  I didn&#39;t know what to do with my self.. This manifiested itself in negative reactions to my enviorment.. I.E Smoking A FUCK TON of weed.  Doing LSD, SHROOMS.  Vaping, juuling, cigarettes.  The whole thing that the older generation DOESN&#39;T understand.. and why can&#39;t they understand that?  They haven&#39;t lived it.. The only reason I have a good memory is because I play back my life.. My reality back over in my head.. I pay attention.. Live in the moment.. And manipulate my environment to achieve the desired effect.  That is after all what we where put on this earth to do.. TRY OUT BEST.. The only path to success starts with a struggle...</p>

<p>HOWEVER.. I do need someone with in depth computer skills, I do not yet posses that knowledge.. Would you like to be apart of what I&#39;m building?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.. This is what I&#39;m after people.. This is the potential I want to tap into.  My writing was powerful.. Why?  I made it personal.. I made you understand by any means and I made a CONNECTION with someone.  I made them understand my ideas, my GOAL, and we came up with a plan of action.. Nothing was created from something.. The potential for creation is infinite, but we can only destory what we&#39;ve created.. Humans need perspective to see how far they&#39;ve come.. Let me give you an example..  If you&#39;ve ever read the book Night by  Elie Wiesel you&#39;ll know about the part where the solider demand they start walking, then they demand they must jog, and then they go... and they go... and they go.. and they go.. and they DON&#39;T STOP for some 40 odd miles.. They didn&#39;t know how far they where going to go.. But they had other people, each other, at the end of it all, when all the mask have been stripped away, what&#39;s the one thing we have left?  OUR HUMANITY.  That is saying something...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well not to be rude man,  but for a genius you chose probably the least effective place for something like this. Your posts are essentially lost in the ether after a day or so IF they are even noticed in the first place. If you want to build a following and maintain it twitter, Instagram, youtube, even a soundcloud would be better. Somewhere people can follow you and will see your posts automatically.  It takes work though. You need to put out content in a way that is useful but that also goes bit by bit, as to have a regular stream of content.  Then you need to find hashtags that relate, or similar subjects and engage with those people. Hopefully they will follow. I have a feeling this is a parody post. If not I would definitely research and learn more about building a network. </p>

<p>You think like Einstein and can change the world but need people to give you a platform. Haven&#39;t you realized thst you are currently using the biggest platform that&#39;s ever been invited to allow people from all over the world to share information, called the internet. What else do you want? </p>

Time is a concept that has perplexed humanity for generation and I&#39;m glad you brought that up..  I BELIEVE that reality is a fabrication of our own minds.. Think about it..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the most part I&#39;m agnostic. I don&#39;t really prescribe to the idea of divine creation, or &quot;creator&quot;-based religious ideology. As in an entity or &#39;someone&#39; creating us/the universe(s). </p>

<p>I&#39;m open to the idea if someone can provide enough substantiated evidence, or definitive proof. But I&#39;ll err on the side of hard science and physical phenomena 9999/10000.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if when Eve bit into the fruit, from that second on.. Everything we&#39;ve created is humanitys creation.. And when you think about it it makes sense.. People say things like &quot;god is dead&quot; or &quot;god has left&quot; but I&#39;ve heard so many other people, a great majority say they believe in some sort of creator.. WE NEED TO SHIFT OUR PERSPECTIVE.  Every decision you&#39;ve made in your life has brought you to this point in life..  What is that point?  Agnostic?  What does that mean, it means that you as an individual have came to the LOGICAL conclusion that there must be SOMETHING more then what has been presented.  So, you&#39;ve read my writing, you&#39;ve seen what I can do.. I WANT TO GIVE YOU ALL THE INPUTS.  But as I&#39;ve said, I need a bigger platform.. I need to be able to operate at my highest level...  Which means having my physical needs satisfied so I can operate on My highest level, and to be honest.. I&#39;m still figuring out my place in this game we call life..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re ridiculous lol. </p>

<p>People make decisions, yes. </p>

<p>That is the definition of agnostic, yes. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen what you can do? Lol not really. Your failure or inability to articulate a coherent idea or foundational philosophy at your <em>normal level</em> doesn&#39;t really lead me to believe that you are capable of providing a complex one at your <em>highest level</em>.</p>

<p>Put up or shut up. I&#39;m not indulging you because I think you&#39;re smart and have answers. Quite the opposite. I think you&#39;re dumber than you believe yourself to be and once you set out to articulate your ideas...you&#39;ll quickly come to that realization. </p>

<p>So please, indulge me. Here&#39;s your platform, I&#39;m listening. </p>

<p>Give me a 10-paragraph traditional essay on the basic overarching theorem related to your <em>discovery</em>. </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t articulate it, you don&#39;t understand it. You&#39;re a fool. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I have said before... Just posting on here tells me something about your mood or behavior at the time of you writing this...
1. You took the time to post this.. 
Which means that you are either A. Curious and want to know more about the topics I am describing
Or B. trying to get more of my knowledge or information.  If I look at what you wrote.  You say that yourself.  So now I have a pretty good idea of that state of mind you where in when you wrote this.  Now I don&#39;t need to worry about anything else other then.
A. you&#39;re curious and B. you took the time to write that out so you must want to know something... Which means the cards really fall in my hands.  And I realize that the knowledge i&#39;ve learned could be worth Billions.  But it&#39;s not about that.  It&#39;s about the people, our humanity.  That&#39;s what it always was about.  You ask for my knowledge?  I&#39;ll give you something to think about... Bear in mind I have not read any of these theories in their entirety.  I&#39;ve just picked up bits and pieces along this journey we call life... So, to use words that are easier to follow.  I&#39;m going to talk about what I&#39;ve learned as if it&#39;s TRUE.</p>

<p>Go to 2nd Chronicles Chapter 14 verses 8-9.  Read it, think about it.  And tell me what you think that means :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your input, You may think it is that because you have that perspective.  And that&#39;s what I enjoy.. You don&#39;t know it yet, but I just manipulated you.. How you might ask?  I got you to see this.. You&#39;ve read what I&#39;ve wrote.. You know what I&#39;m capable of.. Obviously you think my writing is good since you took the time to read it, and you have that &quot;hippy&quot; experience in your pocket.. So now what?  Well guess what?  I&#39;m in your head now..  The government sees people like this the 3% the people that see the big picture, people that see past it all, and they attempt to control them..  Because what you can&#39;t control, can hurt you, and that&#39;s why fear develops.. The unknowable scares us..  We come up with words to describe what we are feeling &quot;Cringe, acid babble, naive, pretentious.&quot;  All these words are nothing more then euphemisms for inexperience.. And that&#39;s what I am.. Young. I&#39;m 18..  But you don&#39;t know my perspective.  My writing is powerful because it has SOUL, it&#39;s personal..  I appeal to every audience on some level, and I manipulate my writing in layers to achieve the desired effect.. So the question becomes.. WHAT IS MY EFFECT? what is my &quot;purpose&quot; sort of speak.. What is our purpose.. I think I might have the answers.. But I need something that has long since left OUR reality, BELIEVE, I need people to believe in me.. I need every input, every perspective, I need every side of the story to be able to form a full opinion, because that&#39;s what opinions are.  Our perception of reality, you know I&#39;ve taken mind altering drugs, and you know what they are capable of.. So this begs the question.. is what I&#39;m saying make sense, and can you back it up with REAL FACTS.  I encourage criticism because I&#39;m not infallible.  A computer can only do so much with so little inputs, I NEED MORE.  I need to here every side of the story before I come to a logical conclusion, but I need real connection with real people, so please.. tell me your story.. I&#39;m listening?</p>
