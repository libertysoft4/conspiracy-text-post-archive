<p>It’s obviously a conspiracy discussed too far when it led to the actions of this mad man taking a gun to what is a family dining place.</p>

<p>I’m just wondering what the background of that guy was and what has happened to him since?</p>

<p>Also is it true, or just fake news, that he fired a shit right through the on-site computer destroying all of its data?  Seems a little far-fetched, but am interested to know.</p>

Unless I’m mistaken, this was the incident that out an end to all discussion on the infamous p gate discussions as it led to an incident that was very bad.

The outcome turned an undesirable topic into one which is toxic.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it was intentional. I can&#39;t substantiate it but I believe the computer tower controlled the cctv in the restaurant and had to be replaced hence the price tag.</p>

<p>If the objective was to destroy the hard drive they could have just walked it out the door at any time day or night, why engage in this drama? To discredit the conspiracy theory? That seems like circular logic, most logically a random guy with some guns showed up, found only people eating pizza and then fired a few rounds into a computer closet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m inclined to agree. It seems like the absolute worst way to go about destroying a harddrive. There&#39;s no guarantee that contents of a hard drive couldn&#39;t be at least partially recovered after only a single gunshot, and it&#39;s definitely the least stealthy method possible to try to destroy evidence (other than a bomb or something). I would be more suspicious if he unloaded a clip into the computer, but it was only one shot. I think you&#39;re right on the money that it was probably just some delusional guy with a gun (as it seems to always be these days unfortunately). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plus I&#39;m pretty sure the shot went through a door and hit the computer. Some people will say that seems like an awfully convenient coincidence, but again, if their goal was to just destroy the hard drive there are much simpler ways to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But why stage such a public event and draw people&#39;s attention to the hard drive when they could have just smashed it to a million pieces with a hammer?

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. It doesn&#39;t seem like there&#39;s any evidence past pure speculation. If this was a big conspiracy and the police were in on it, why would they only half cover it up? It seems so sloppy that this would even be public knowledge if that was the case. </p>

You denied that you think everyone who goes to Haiti is a paedophile but that&#39;s clearly the implication of your posts. There are plenty of child abuse cases and human trafficking in New York, and Bill Clinton has been there too, so do you also think that going to New York must also be a red flag?</p>

<p>This is just par for the course with pizzagaters, who think that a person who simply knows someone who&#39;s committed a crime or has gone somewhere a crime was once committed is evidence of that person&#39;s guilt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, you&#39;re saying that you didn&#39;t write &quot;Red flag goes up&quot; in relation to Welch doing volunteer work in Haiti and then, when asked why going to Haiti was a red flag, referred to &quot;Clinton operations in Haiti&quot;? And don&#39;t think that I haven&#39;t noticed that you still are unable to explain why Welch going to Haiti raised red flags for you.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not intended as name calling, rather as shorthand for people who believe and push the pizzagate conspiracy theory. Instead of writing that out each time, I just call them pizzagaters. they invented the name pizzagate, so I don&#39;t see why they would take offence at pizzagaters.</p>

<p>What am I defending? The truth and the presumption of innocence. I&#39;m also pissed off at people who have taken the very real and terible issue of child abuse and have used it as a political smear. Promulgating satanic panics and inane conspiracy theories about welathy elite paedophile rings just detracts from real child abuse.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an important distinction, particularly since people are trying to say he must&#39;ve worked out some kind of deal to avoid punishment. In fact, hitting a person is so extremely unlikely to result in punishment, that Freakonomics described it as &quot;The Perfect Crime&quot; (and that&#39;s when the incident results in death):</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That cam is a red-light camera and <em>never</em> faced CPP in the first place. It normally points north-west across the Connecticut Avenue  and Nebraska Avenue intersection, and CPP is to the east-nor&#39;-east (ie, behind the camera). There would be no sense at all in having a red-light camera point directly across a road at right angles where there were no red lights, but people still keep repeating this bogus claim that it was moved off CPP.</p>

<p>On the day in question I believe it was pointed more to the west (there is another red light in that direction). It does move from time to time. Someone posted on Voat another time when it was not pointing across the intersection, but there were no &quot;false flags&quot; that day. And, in fact, right at this moment, it is pointed north down Nebraska Avenue, taking in those red lights. There must be another &quot;false flag&quot; planned for right now.</p>

I checked the cam when the post on voat was no five minutes old and it was like OP described, having a pole blocked most part of its view.

<p>IT DID HAVE CPP&#39;S ENTRANCE IN IT&#39;S VIEW! Hundrets of people checked the cam at this time an you won&#39;t find a single comment from that day claiming &quot;It does not face CPP.&quot; How come? The only people claiming it didn&#39;t, appeared only months later... Now everytime someone reminds people of what we have whitnessed that day, somebody like you comes, claiming it&#39;s a lie...</p>

<p>Where were you that day? Were was &quot;are we sure&quot; that day? The shill who frequents v/pizzagate on a daily basis since day one, but wasn&#39;t there to make that claim, the day it happened, but does claim it now every single time someone is talking about the cam!? </p>

I dont recall my family going to a place with wall murals such as an alien telling a kid to shut up and fuck with drag queens performing on the regular. My family is old school i guess.</p>

<p>Evidence of this? I&#39;ve seen the images of the murals but I&#39;ve never seen one anything like that.</p>

<p>They probably are. CPP strikes me as being nothing more than a &quot;hip&quot; pizzeria.</p>

<p>I posted the other link because it had a good summary of the various photos associated to CPP/JA, make of it what you will including the assumption that im just swallowing all of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, we don&#39;t know how long after the graffiti was written that the photo was taken. I&#39;ve seen plenty of graffiti in the toilets in cafes and public buildings, and it&#39;s not evidence of anything more than some people like to write shit on walls.</p>

<p>As for the other site, if you didn&#39;t believe the stuff there, why would you post a link to it, along with a comment that made it clear that you thought that something was up with CPP?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s listed as the writer, not the director, and the film is a horor flick about kids in an abandoned mill, so why would you automatically assume it may be about a mill in a town with a lot of sex offenders? Thiis is how this shit starts: someone reads your post and next time there&#39;s a discussion about Edgar Welch, they post that his father made a film about a mill in a town of child abusers. It&#39;s Chinese whispers with malicious intent.</p>
