It&#39;s one thing for a handful of people in an organization to be pedophiles. Chalk it up to a few fucked up, terrible, rotten apples. But it seems like a huge percentage of priests are pedophiles. I know Alex Jones says they are &quot;interdemetional vampires.&quot; I was just wanting to hear other conspiracies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s not true at all. The Bible doesn’t speak with vulgar details however with spiritual understanding it addresses such things using words that are clean because it is important to keep your thoughts clean and spending time thinking or meditating on the gory details is focusing on unclean thoughts. There are many other references in Galatians 5 the fruits of the spirit are covered and the fruits of the flesh are also addressed historically and biblically witchcraft, sorcery, magic, worshiping strange gods are all associated with things like child molesting and sacrifice. </p>

<p>Matthew 18:6 ¶ But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.</p>

<p>7 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!</p>

<p>Mark 9:42 ¶ And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all has to do with worshiping strange gods and strange religions it’s a form of what you might call the mystery religions which Crowley really brought to the mainstream. If you want to know the truth you have to go deep but first understand that there are more distractions than truth out there the only source of truth where the answers all come together when you begin to study for understanding. </p>
