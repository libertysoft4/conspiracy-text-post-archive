        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-08-15 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/WeAreTheResistance.html">WeAreTheResistance</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I&#39;ve scraped almost all of Peter Strozk&#39;s GoFundMe campaign,  after seeing a higher then normal number of anonymous donors,  many for large dollar amounts. </p>

<p>The data is in Excel format,  and includes the following fields; Donors Name,  Amount Donated,  Time Stamp,  URL to donors profile.   I&#39;m working on scraping the URL profiles to gather the number of campaigns the user has donated to,   how much they&#39;ve donated on the site through sharing on social media,  along with a similar unrelated campaign to get a baseline data set,  and should be finished soon. </p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<p>Can I share these spreadsheets on Reddit without fear of &quot;doxing&quot;? The information is all available to anyone on GoFundMe.com,  and doesn&#39;t contain any identifiable information other then names</p>

<p>Also I really am not to well versed on analyzing large sets of data like this,  and am curious if anyone here is familiar with data analysis.</p>

<p>I really just want to know the following; How many first time donors on GoFundMe are donating to his campaign,  compared with seasoned GoFundMe users (just from browsing the data,  there are a ton of anonymous,  and or first time donors), when comparing a normal campaign to Strozk&#39;s, what the percentages of anonymous donors are in both,  and whether the same accounts are donating multiple times. Also the time stamps are rather interesting as well.   The number of what appears to be American&#39;s (just judging by name) who donated between 2am EST - 6am EST is just about equal to those donating during the day. </p>

<p>It could be 100% legit, and I might be wasting my time,  but hopefully someone better versed in data analysis can help me out here. </p>

<p>Also if there&#39;s a better sub for me to post this to,  please let me know as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks,  got a link by chance?  The data definitely does NOT contain phone numbers,  addresses, or links to any social media platforms outside of GoFundMe, and the URL&#39;s to those profiles contain only minimal information,  such as number of campaigns the user has donated to,  and the dollar amount they&#39;ve made for campaigns by sharing campaigns on social media. Many of the names are also clearly fake,  (one of my favorites is PeterStrozkMeOff lol), definitely not trying to break the rules. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea,  that&#39;s not a bad idea.  Actually the data set has each donor numbered already in sequential order,  but that kind of takes comparing how many people have donated multiple times and the total amounts they donated out of it.   </p>

<p>You&#39;d map each name to an ID.</p>

<p>So if you had something like:</p>

<p>bob, joe, bill, jane, bob, bill</p>

<p>it would become:</p>

<p>This data isn&#39;t helpful unless you break it down further for large donations.  106437/2595=$41.02 which is basically nothing per person.... </p>

<p>So the nonanons account for $27.53 per person.  </p>

<p>Maybe these people don&#39;t want to be analyzed by their jobs or peers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The total amount raised is the closest to Strozk&#39;s currently active.  If you find a campaign that you&#39;d like me to compare with Strozk&#39;s I&#39;ll gladly do it.  I was going to compare McCabe and Strozk, but McCabe completely deleted his campaign (very unusual for GoFundMe, most people leave them up indefinitely).  </p>

<p>Has GoFundMe changed something that made the previous code that you used to reach that conclusion not work anymore?  Can you share the code you used and the data generated from it as well as the other GoFundMe campaigns that you ran it against?</p>

<p>I find it hard to believe so many people are all of sudden are pulling out their wallets and giving $100 to somebody they don&#39;t know, just to make a political statement. Especially all the anonymous donors.</p>
