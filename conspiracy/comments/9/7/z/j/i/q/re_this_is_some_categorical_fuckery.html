So, we have to explain to the general public that parasitic corporations, including fed state county and city/towns are  tyrranical. Second to child abuse, and before water privatization, Electro magnetic fields are top urgency. The trees are dying from the pulsing microwave currents from 5g. See those dystopian towers? They are cooking us. Smart meters + cells,iPads laptops + 5g + leds + chemtrails = control and genocide. Only psychopathic profiteer eugenists want this. If we can dumb it down, empower people, provide effective solutions, we can stop it. MIC runs this shit show of a country. Justice system is abusing power v. Due Process. We, the people are slaves. I want others working together- seeking solutions, and/educating the public. I can’t stand by. Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I am dead serious.  It’s not hard to find an <a href="https://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20071104233556/psychology/images/8/83/Atmospheric_electromagnetic_transmittance_or_opacity.jpg">atmospheric transparency chart</a>.  Note the dip half way between 1cm and 1mm, on a logarithmic scale like that it’s position is 3mm which converts into 100GHz.  That is the frequency another commenter’s video referenced as the frequency of 5G, which makes perfect sense because the fact that air is transparent at that wavelength is the exact reason why that wavelength is useful for broadcasting signals through the air.</p>

<p>The Sun’s light is pretty darn close approximation of a blackbody curve, besides the tiny absorption lines in the spectrum it blasts out electromagnetic radiation of every wavelength including the microwave range.  Most of it is blocked by the atmosphere but not light in the 100GHz range.  Along with radio waves and visible light it’s able to go through the atmosphere like it’s nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate to be <em>that guy</em>, but 100 ghz isn’t exactly ionizing radiation.  That falls in the microwave spectrum, I did the math and 4g photons have about 300 times less energy than the infrared radiation being emitted by your body as a result of body heat.</p>

<p>You might be thinking “oh shit, microwaves are the same thing used to cook food!” and you’d be right but only technically.  Microwaves used to cook food use a very specific wavelength that interacts with water and blasts it into a Faraday cage.  The entire microwave spectrum is actually fairly wide and the wavelength used by 5G is very far from the wavelength used to warm your nachos.</p>

<p>In fact, the type of radiation being used is a type that the Sun emits as well and that easily passes through the atmosphere.  If you are going to be concerned perhaps the thing to be worried about is the giant ball of plasma blasting us all with radiation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, who needs math when you can use feelings as your facts?</p>

<p>If it were dangerous we’d already be dead thanks to that huge ball of plasma in the sky.  Microwaves are only dangerous if they have enough power and are at the right frequency to cause physical burns.  Thanks to the inverse square law you’d be hard pressed to even measure the heat from a 5G tower let alone get burned by it, and that’s assuming it’s at the right frequency to interact with water molecules which it isn’t.  It’s even further from ionizing radiation than visible light.  Seriously, what dangers even exist here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know how I said that I studied wireless communications in college?  Well, that was as a part of my full major which was information security.</p>

<p>That being said, I do agree that smart meters represent a security risk from an IT standpoint just like all smart devices because smart devices rarely if ever have security patches released.  In fact they generally do seem like a terrible idea.  However, just because using them for surveillance is possible doesn’t necessarily mean it’s currently being done.</p>

<p>However, that has nothing to do with radio waves and weather they are dangerous.  They aren’t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, I do understand how short pulse radio and microwave communications work because working with wireless communication systems is something I’m trained to do.  I got my information from a college class, not some conspiracy video.  You are yet to describe how radio waves regardless of how fast they pulse can do any harm to humans whatsoever.</p>

<p>Secondly, information security is clearly real enough that companies are willing to pay people like me $150,000 - $200,000 a year to manage.  I agree that nothing is truly unhackable but it’s possible to be very close to unhackable.  A good network administrator is the difference between a network that can be compromised by a script kitty running an open source WEP cracker, and a network that will catch unsuccessful hackers while only being vulnerable to things like day zero attacks, and social engineering.</p>

<p>Most people seem to have this conception that computers are magic, which is why Hollywood can get away with super inaccurate hacker fight scenes.  When you study them enough though it becomes clear that a computer is just a machine like any other, not the result of a wizard spluffing in a box.</p>

<p>I don’t know what exactly you mean by information security being “an illusion”, but I can spend over an hour explaining the entire path this message takes from me to you including things like the 7 OSI layers it goes through before leaving my phone, the border gateway protocol used to get the message to the right geographic location, much of what goes on within Reddit’s servers, and so on.  This post is long enough as is though, so I’m just going to ask you to be a bit more specific.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The frequency is specific to water molecules and pulsates every. 04 seconds. 164,000 times a day. This frequency penetrates the blood/brain barrier, causes serious harm when paired with wireless phones and smart meters. The smart grid is real. See the dystopian towers everywhere?

    <div class="md"><p>5G uses two ranges of signals.  One of them is 0.6-6 GHz and the other is 24-86 GHz.  The resonant frequency of water is 22 GHz which is not included in that range.</p>

<p>Also, the blood brain barrier is a <strong>chemical</strong> barrier that keeps toxins and pathogens in your blood away from your brain, it has absolutely nothing to do with protecting your brain from radiation so radiation penetrating it has nothing to do with how harmful it is.  It would make sense of you had radioactive isotopes in your blood which do a lot of damage of they can cross the brain blood barrier, but last I checked injecting myself with plutonium was not a step in connecting my phone to a cellular network.</p>

<p>You are still yet to explain why a pulsating signal is any less harmless than a constant signal.</p>

<p>I don’t get why you keep insisting that cell towers are “dystopian” in any way.  You’ve been reading too much fiction dude.  They’re just communication towers, nothing dystopian about them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That assumes you’re right in a debate where the thing being debated is weather you’re right.</p>

<p>I can’t tell exactly what part you’re replying to but I suspect it’s the part asking you to explain how a radio wave damages a brain.  If you’re going to reply at least tell me what interactions take place to make the brain get damaged.  Is it heat?  Is it damage to DNA?  Does it excite a particular chemical to make it more reactive?  Give me specifics, otherwise I might as well be arguing with a brick wall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate to be <em>that guy</em>, but 100 ghz isn’t exactly ionizing radiation.  That falls in the microwave spectrum, I did the math and 4g photons have about 300 times less energy than the infrared radiation being emitted by your body as a result of body heat.</p>

<p>You might be thinking “oh shit, microwaves are the same thing used to cook food!” and you’d be right but only technically.  Microwaves used to cook food use a very specific wavelength that interacts with water and blasts it into a Faraday cage.  The entire microwave spectrum is actually fairly wide and the wavelength used by 5G is very far from the wavelength used to warm your nachos.</p>

<p>In fact, the type of radiation being used is a type that the Sun emits as well and that easily passes through the atmosphere.  If you are going to be concerned perhaps the thing to be worried about is the giant ball of plasma blasting us all with radiation.</p>
