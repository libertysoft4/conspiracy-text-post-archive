        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So why isn’t the Media asking a very BASIC question: WAS Omarosa tapped by the Russians to SECRETLY record White House briefings? And then if there was juicy information to be used to Black Mail America into lifting Russians Sanctions? This is a HUGE NATIONAL SECURITY RISK and the Media who hates Trump with a passion ain’t even continuing there own narrative Conspiracy Theory when SHE HAS TAPES. </p>

<p>Why RECORD General Kelly and President Trump when you work for them? 
Why RECORD President Trump saying he didn’t know she was going to be fired then release it to the Media? </p>

<p>WHY TAKE THE LEGAL RISKS TO RELEASING THESE TAPES? O you have a Book coming out please. That AINT worth the Legal Risks as you’ll be paying more in Lawyer fees then Book purchases income. And you’ve already been fired Trump before. You know who your working for. And she’s already a “Celebrity” as she’s been in the like light for years now. Why get on the Anti-Trump hate train now? When Your already a Celebrity. I want to know how much money did the Russians offer her to pull a stunt like this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me it’s concerning that so many people around trump have decided to record their conversations with him, I know it’s not the popular opinion around here but I think if everyone around you finds a need to record your conversations with them, it’s probably because they know what’s going on is shady and don’t want to be used as a scapegoat, or thrown under the bus while being publicly attacked by the president who only cares about himself with nothing to defend themselves when the house of cards finally comes crashing down..... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no she doesn&#39;t work for Putin but she does worship obama. she campaigned for him and voted for him of course. already she has been exposed w her lies so who knows what she really knows or has. i think trump is just enamored enough w women he makes poor choices. it amazes me tho, all these who throw folks under the bus, how do they think anyone would trust what they say or do, just boggles my mind. So since she was so close to O i say she worked for him against Trump.</p>
