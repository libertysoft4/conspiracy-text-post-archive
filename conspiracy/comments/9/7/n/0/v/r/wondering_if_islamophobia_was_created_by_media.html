    <div class="md"><p>Can you give us any information on Islamic finance. It is interesting that Jesus threw the money lenders out of the temple and usury is a sin specifically mentioned in the new testament but remains the basis of U  S  policy. Why don&#39;t the Christians speak out against the banks including the Federal Reserve. Or for that matter the illegal wars that the U S has been involved in for over half a century. Why do they believe Mike Pence and Donald Trump are any different than Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger. If Christians weren&#39;t told from the pulpit to support their governments as if they were supporting Jesus maybe the evil owners of the governments would have to start behaving as Jesus ask us to.</p>

<p>No, there aren&#39;t. Go look it up.</p>

<p>I have no idea what &quot;countless people&quot; think. I do know what the people who actually have put years of study into this think. Historians, biblical scholars, and linguists all agree. They know what the phrase means and it doesn&#39;t mean &quot;money lenders&quot;. There&#39;s no controversy over this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, someone at &quot;allposters.com&quot; typed the title in wrong.</p>

<p>The title of this painting in French (Valentin de Boulogne was French) is &quot;Le Christ chassant les marchands du temple&quot;, literally &quot;Christ Driving the Merchants from the Temple&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what it&#39;s called in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=A-00DQAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA126&amp;amp;dq=%22Christ+Driving%22">the book <em>Valentin de Boulogne: Beyond Caravaggio</em></a> and at the <a href="https://metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/663583">Metropolitan Museum web site</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s translated as &quot;Christ Driving the Money Changers from the Temple&quot; in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=LviRBgAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA162&amp;amp;dq=Valentin+de+Boulogne+%22christ+driving%22+OR+%22jesus+driving%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy4pmkzvPcAhWIv1MKHY2eBPEQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Valentin%20de%20Boulogne%20%22christ%20driving%22%20OR%20%22jesus%20driving%22&amp;amp;f=false"><em>The Moment of Caravaggio</em></a> and in the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=5rLpAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;q=Valentin+de+Boulogne+%22christ+driving%22+OR+%22jesus+driving%22&amp;amp;dq=Valentin+de+Boulogne+%22christ+driving%22+OR+%22jesus+driving%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDpabo0_PcAhVH2VMKHbdMCX0Q6AEINDAC">official guide for the Palazzo Barberini</a>, where the painting is hanging.</p>

<p>If you search google ngrams to see how often the phrases &quot;driving the money changers&quot; and &quot;driving the money lenders&quot; have been found in <em>any</em> books that Google has scanned (not just in relation to art), <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=driving+the+money+lenders%2Cdriving+the+moneychangers%2Cdriving+the+money+changers&amp;amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;amp;year_start=1800&amp;amp;year_end=2000&amp;amp;corpus=15&amp;amp;smoothing=3&amp;amp;share=&amp;amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2Cdriving%20the%20moneychangers%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bdriving%20the%20moneychangers%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BDriving%20the%20Moneychangers%3B%2Cc0%3B%3Bdriving%20the%20Moneychangers%3B%2Cc0%3B.t4%3B%2Cdriving%20the%20money%20changers%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bdriving%20the%20money%20changers%3B%2Cc0%3B%3Bdriving%20the%20Money%20Changers%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BDriving%20the%20Money%20Changers%3B%2Cc0">here are the results.</a></p>

<p>There are no occurrences of &quot;driving the money lenders&quot;. It&#39;s just not a thing.</p>

<p>You can compare <em>all</em> English translations of the Bible verses where this is mentioned:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Matthew%2021:12">Matthew 21:12</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Mark%2011:15">Mark 11:15</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Luke%2019:45">Luke 19:45</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/John%202:14">John 2:14</a> and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/John%202:15">2:15</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It has <em>never</em> been translated as lenders. The Bible is explicit at what is going on: &quot;In the temple courts he found people selling cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money.&quot; Not lending money.</p>

<p>Exchanging foreign money for silver money for the temple is mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, too.</p>

<p>There is no controversy about the translation among any biblical scholars, Christian or Jewish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said that&#39;s the way all kinds of people just happen to know it. Like a Mandela effect.</p>

<p>As for Christ driving the money grubbing scum out of the Temple, it hardly matters trying to be precise or genteel about what you want to call them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the only incident where Christ ever openly displayed any anger or took any physical action against anyone so it&#39;s safe to say it was a pretty vulgar and disgusting bunch of characters that were haggling and plying their trade within the Temple walls in order to miss no opportunity to make a buck.</p>

<p>gist of it is, that taking interest on lent money is a sin.</p>

<p>So they find a way to co-invest money (and other ways) with borrower, thus they share the profit if project is successful  but they also share the risk of project being failure.</p>

<p>basically co-investing instead of borrowing money and waiting for it to be returned with interest no matter what happens (by seizing property if lender cant return money+interest)</p>

<p><strong>BUT this is very simplified version and based on my very limited knowledge on the matter (I used to read about it few years ago) from the top of my head.</strong></p>

<p>You can search more on the internet if interested.</p>

<p>&quot;Allah does not forbid you from dealing kindly and fairly with those who have neither fought nor driven you out of your homes. Surely Allah loves those who are fair.</p>

<p>&quot;Allah only forbids you from befriending those who have fought you for ˹your˺ faith, driven you out of your homes, or supported ˹others˺ in doing so. And whoever takes them as friends, then it is they who are the ˹true˺ wrongdoers.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://quran.com/60/8-9?translations=101">https://quran.com/60/8-9?translations=101</a></p>

<p>So, basically, if a group of people invade a Muslim-majority land with the intention of waging war against the Muslims because of their religion, then it is obligatory for the Muslims to fight back against them. On the other hand, Muslims should deal kindly and fairly with non-Muslims who do not wage war against Muslims and who do not chase Muslims out of their homes. </p>

<p>It is unlawful for Muslims to kill non-combatant non-Muslims simply because they express dislike or disinterest in Islam. As Allah, be He glorified in the highest, says in the Quran:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;˹In time,˺ Allah may bring about goodwill between you and those of them you ˹now˺ hold as enemies. For Allah is Most Capable. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&quot;</p>

<p>Iraq</p>

<p>Sudan</p>

<p>Libya</p>

<p>Cuba</p>

<p>North Korea</p>

<p>Iran</p>

<p>2 American presidents who were killed happen to be 2 American presidents who worked to create a federally regulated currency. Abe Lincoln and JFK.</p>

<p>The enemy of the United States army always happens to line right up with the enemies of the federal reserve bank. </p>

<p>Here is a great quote:</p>

<p>&quot;I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.&quot;</p>

<p>-Woodrow Wilson, after signing the Federal Reserve into existence</p>

<p>&quot;[...] actually familiar with the religion and culture [...]&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, religion culture.</p>

<p>the disinformation is simply NOT going to work.</p>

<p>Disinformation? Provide your evidence to support your claims, if you are truthful.</p>

<p>How can you say that the way &quot;Islam works&quot; is by lying to everyone about what Islam is truly about until they revert and then BAM! hitting them with orders to murder people and rape women?</p>

<p>It is impermissible for a Muslim to mislead non-Muslims about Islam. Islam is not like Freemasonry or some other secret society in which you have to be initiated and earn the trust of the gatekeepers of the true teachings in order gradually raise in rank and finally learn what the group actually believes; rather, the teachings of Islam are laid out in black-and-white in the Quran, easy for anyone to access and understand. There is no top-secret esoteric knowledge that only Muslims know. You do not revert to Islam and then find out there are a bunch of secrets we&#39;ve been keeping to ourselves and deceiving everyone else about. Everything is right out in the open. </p>

<p><strong>Substantiate your claims, if you are one of those who tell the truth.</strong> Provide evidence, with context. Swear by God that you are truthful. I swear by the God of Abraham that I have spoken the truth about my religion.</p>

<p>If you can quote a verse of the Quran that says Muslims are permitted to commit rape, then quote it. </p>

<p>If you can quote a verse of the Quran that says that Muslims must stealthily, sneakily murder all non-combatant men, women and children simply for being non-Muslims, then quote it. </p>

<p>If you can quote a verse of the Quran that says that Muslims should lie and deceive non-Muslims about Islam, then quote it.</p>

<p>But never will you be able to quote these things. You have lied about God, may He be exalted. I admonish you to repent and seek the truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Do not falsely declare with your tongues, &#39;This is lawful, and that is unlawful,&#39; ˹only˺ fabricating lies against Allah. Indeed, those who fabricate lies against Allah will never succeed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>Woe to every sinful liar</strong></p>

<p>&quot;And <strong>when he knows anything of Our verses, he takes them in ridicule.</strong> Those will have a humiliating punishment.</p>

<p>&quot;Before them is Hell, and what they had earned will not avail them at all, nor what they had taken besides Allah as allies. And they will have a great punishment.</p>

<p>&quot;This [Qur&#39;an] is guidance. And those who have disbelieved in the verses of their Lord will have a painful punishment of foul nature.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s been my guess for a long time. </p>

<p>Islam is the last of the Abrahamic religions that take it&#39;s stance against usury seriously. </p>

<p>These days even Islamic banking though tends to get around this by assigning &#39;fees&#39; for loans instead of interest. </p>

<p>Still, Sharia law bars investing into businesses considered Haram. Pork, Alcohol, Arms Dealers, Porn, etc. It also bans speculation.</p>

<p>A 401k or mutual fund would be Haram, and tools such as those and the stock market itself are the real weapons of Empire. Makes expansion into the middle east a bit tricky for our masters. </p>

<p>&#39;You are also to count off seven sabbaths of years for yourself, seven times seven years, so that you have the time of the seven sabbaths of years, namely, forty-nine years. &#39;You shall then sound a ram&#39;s horn abroad on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the day of atonement you shall sound a horn all through your land. &#39;You shall thus consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim a release through the land to all its inhabitants It shall be a jubilee for you, and each of you shall return to his own property, and each of you shall return to his family.&quot;</p>

<p>Leviticus 25:8-10</p>

<p>Every 49 years marked the forgiveness of all debt and the release of all slaves. Seems to me we&#39;re a couple thousand years overdue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Radical Islam was created by the CIA in order to raise armies of reactionary soldiers for their global struggle against socialism.  There&#39;s certainly incentive there to suppress opposition to usury, but first and foremost is the prevention of political challenge to the elite&#39;s wealth and dominant ecological position.  Nurturing Islamophobia is their way of taking advantage of their cold war strategy from the other direction.  Having created a jihadi movement that vanquished secularism, they had a ready made villain who they could manipulate the 1st world public into hating.  They&#39;re nurturing ethnonationalism because they know climate change is coming, and they quickly need large populations willing to kill both climate refugees, and those who dissent to the killing of climate refugees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ultimately the confrontation between Christianity and the Islamic world is meant to &quot;fulfill prophecy&quot;, or more exactly, it fits into a hermetic pattern - it is meant to crystalize a new reality.</p>

<p>The Christian West, represented by the cross (which itself symbolizes the sun), confronts the Islamic East, represented by the moon. From that conflict is (re-)born, in its center, the enlightened Star (hexagram), or pseudo-Jewish Babylonian Talmudism. The sun, moon, and planets/stars are the 3 astrotheological &quot;realms&quot;.</p>

<p>This is hermetism 101: Osiris is the West, Isis is the East (do you understand now why they chose that name?), Horus as the &quot;miraculous&quot; product of the two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is definitely an effort to paint all Muslims with the same brush while there are two major and very different sects, Sunni and Shia, and any number of lesser ones affiliated with either or distinctly different on their own, not dissimilar from the numerous varieties of Christianity that you can find, including radical ones that aren&#39;t above resorting to violence in the name of their faith. </p>

<p>There are also some important Muslim scholars and philosophers both past and present who are well worth reading as is the history concerning how much more advanced and sophisticated the Muslim world was in science, astronomy, mathematics and architecture before the Crusades introduced those advances into Europe and western culture and simply took all the credit for it afterwards. Something that most European history books fail to mention.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the Sunni fundamentalists, however, that interpret &quot;jihad&quot; as a physical war against all &quot;infidels&quot; and makes no bones about that war being against anyone that doesn&#39;t adhere to their own strict fundamentalist set of beliefs including less rigidly inclined  Sunnis, all Shias, Christians, Jews etc. etc. </p>

<p>Shias on the other hand interpret &quot;jihad&quot; strictly as a personal and spiritual battle against the temptations of other religions and this world that go against the basic tenets of how they should live their lives. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also stated in the Koran that Mohammed didn&#39;t consider Christians and Jews as &quot;infidels&quot; since they believed in the same God that Mohammed was the last and final prophet after Jesus which the Shias fully respect.</p>

<p>There are also some important Muslim scholars and philosophers both past and present who are well worth reading as is the history concerning how much more advanced and sophisticated the Muslim world was in science, astronomy, mathematics and architecture before the Crusaders encountered them and then introduced those advances into Europe and western culture and simply took all the credit for it afterwards. Something that most European history books fail to mention.</p>

<p>One of the first things that my AP World History teacher emphasized that &quot;The Dark Ages&quot; was a strictly European circumstance with many Middleastern and West African civilizations flourishing during this period.</p>
