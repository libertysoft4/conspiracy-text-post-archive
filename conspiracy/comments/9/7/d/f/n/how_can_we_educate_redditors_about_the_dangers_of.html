    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, the mindset of the majority has been manipulated in a way such that anyone who sounds suspicious of the government story is labeled as a conspiracy nut. Thank the media for it and the gullible unsuspecting viewers. Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) has a term for it: Anchor. That is a reason why conspiracy and theory always go together. As a result, it&#39;s easy to dismiss people even with valid credentials and research as crazy, just because they don&#39;t adhere to the popular opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one&#39;s mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them....To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies — all this is indispensably necessary. Even in using the word doublethink it is necessary to exercise doublethink. For by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality; by a fresh act of doublethink one erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth</p>

<p>Doublethink is a form of trained, willful intellectual blindness to contradictions in a belief system. Doublethink differs from ordinary hypocrisy in that the &quot;doublethinking&quot; person deliberately had to forget the contradiction between his two opposing beliefs — and then deliberately forget that he had forgotten the contradiction. He then had to forget the forgetting of the forgetting, and so on; this intentional forgetting, once begun, continues indefinitely. In the novel&#39;s notes, Orwell describes it as &quot;controlled insanity&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this is true at all.  For example I think the vast majority of Americans assume the CIA is involved in all kinds of underhanded shit.</p>

<p>But for &#39;conspiricies&#39;, people do tend to lump the good with the bad.  There are so many nuts clinging to baseless nonsense. </p>

<p>For example the &#39;moon landing hoax&#39; theory.  This has been so thoroughly debunked and explained, there is zero room for doubt.  Zero.  A fifth grader can understand the explanations of the laughable &#39;evidence&#39;.  Yet there are zealots who still cling to it.  </p>

<p>For example, if someone told you that the Afghanistan War was a conspiracy to take over opium revenue and control fossil fuels that required a trigger, which materialized as a false-flag terrorist attack that killed 3,000 U.S. citizens, would you call that person crazy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take over opium revenue? The US has been distinctly hands off the country&#39;s cash crop because many of our allies on the ground were growing it. 40k soldiers watching over 250k sq miles is far from the amount of people we would need to control the trade. The country is too vast for the US to take out the producers one by one, and attempting so would only make the crops more valued and lucrative.</p>

<p>The Forbes family of China and Boston, of which US Senator John Forbes Kerry and John Murray Forbes are members, amassed a huge fortune in the China trade, initially trading North American furs and manufactured goods for tea and other goods from China.</p>

<p>Forbes also made a considerable fortune smuggling opium during the Opium Wars. The British wanted to keep a monopoly on supplying the Chinese with opium grown in India. However, during the Opium Wars the British ships were prevented from delivering their cargoes of opium and American ship owners such as Forbes, who could sail the final miles, made great amounts of money delivering the cargoes for the British. Forbes family members later engaged in other merchant banking and railroad investment projects around the world.</p>

<p>Born in France, John Murray Forbes entered the China trade at the behest of his Perkins uncles, and after his brother Tom Forbes died, and thereafter John Murray Forbes was mentored by the Chinese merchant Houqua who considered Forbes to be like a son. Following John Murray Forbes into China were several brothers and cousins, including Francis Blackwell Forbes, the great grandfather of John Forbes Kerry. The Forbes family lived and traded in China at first due to a family connection with the Perkins family. Later, some of the Forbes family sold their China trading interests to the Russell and Company, a shipping empire which was headed by Robert Bennett Forbes, and was later associated with Yale&#39;s development and endowment. Yale&#39;s Skull and Bones society was founded by William H. Russell, one of the members of the wealthy Russell family, in 1832.</p>

<p>The Dictionary of American Biography reports that the noted American ship captain Robert Bennet Forbes played &quot;a prominent role in the outbreak of the Chinese Opium War.&quot;</p>

<p>Several of the Forbes family cashed out of their dealings in China after the Opium War, and reinvested in Europe and the United States. Some of the population growth of Chicago and Midwestern Plains states in the middle to late 19th century was due to John Murray Forbes&#39; railroad projects in Michigan and Chicago. The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Co., from Chicago west to the Pacific was built by John Murray Forbes who had perhaps a reputation for sound financial management amongst the railroad tycoons of the day. In 1879, William Forbes, son of John Murray Forbes, risked the fortune to financially back Alexander Graham Bell&#39;s telephone company, and become president of the company, a risk which paid off. William Cameron Forbes used his wealth to become Governor General of the Philippines. His niece Ruth Forbes Paine Young tapped her Forbes family inheritance to finance the International Peace Academy. Her husband invented the Bell Helicopter used in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. In a tiny footnote to history, Ruth Forbes Paine Young&#39;s son, Michael R. Paine, and his wife Ruth Paine, allowed Maria Oswald, the wife of Lee Harvey Oswald, to live in their house as a family friend, and Oswald&#39;s rifle was stored for a time in the Paine&#39;s family garage.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The Step-brother of William Huntington Russell , Samuel Russel is a prominent member of the Russell family who ran a opium trade in China. (Russell &amp; Co)</p>

<p>Note about Skull and Bones :
It all began at Yale. In 1832, General William Huntington Russell and Alphonso
Taft put together a super secret society for the elite children of the Anglo-
American Wall Street banking establishment. William Huntington Russell&#39;s
step-brother Samuel Russell ran &quot;Russell &amp; Co.&quot;, the world&#39;s largest OPIUM
smuggling operation in the world at the time. Alphonso Taft is the Grandfather of our ex-president Howard Taft, the creator of the Forerunner to the United Nations.
Only 15 seniors are picked each year by the former graduating class. They are required as a part of their initiation ceremony to lie naked in a coffin and recite
their sexual history. This method allows other members to control the individual
by threatening to reveal their innermost secrets if they do not &quot;go-along&quot;.</p>

<p>Note about the clipper (ship) &quot;Samuel Russell&quot; :
She was named in honor of a friend of the Low Brothers, Samuel Russell, a senior member of the American firm of Russell &amp; Co., operating in China, who was a one time partner of the Lows. The &quot;Russell&quot; as she soon would be called by many, was 174 feet in length, 34 feet, 4 inches in breadth with a depth of hold of 20 feet. A red and white ribbon streak ran along the waterline of the Russell&#39;s black hull.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A picture of soldiers in a poppy field is your argument? I never said the troops weren&#39;t in the fields, just that we don&#39;t have enough men on the ground to effectively patrol the land.</p>

<p>And your graphic supports my case. The Taliban outlawed opium growing, but its position as a cash crop in Afghanistan meant that it didn&#39;t disappear overnight especially among peoples resisting the Taliban. When the troops went into Afghanistan, opium growing skyrocketed because it was so entrenched into the rebels&#39; economy that the US couldn&#39;t do much without causing ire among its allies. Those allies/warlords helped keep the peace outside of the cities so peace &gt; opium fields.</p>

<p>The rest of your post is a bait &#39;n switch. The opium conflict in China involved opium customers, not producers. Skull &amp; Bones also has nothing to do with Afghanistan&#39;s opium industry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>re: 9/11 google &#39;wtc 7&#39;</p>

<p>Honestly, I think that ethically the wars must be very wrong and in the overall financial scheme they are ruinous, but on a short-term more surface level the empire benefits with cash (from the opium) and fossil fuel deals.</p>

<p>I think because of those apparent surface benefits and the facts that it makes us feel like we have a larger purpose, many people are happy to go along with it but the explanations given for these wars (fighting the Taliban so they don&#39;t blow up any more of our buildings etc.) can only hold up for so long before people start to think.</p>

<p>I wish that, if we really need to secure the territory for oil/gas deals and realistically there is no diplomatic or more civilized way, i.e. China and Russia are going to send in their own tanks etc. if we don&#39;t, we could just say that&#39;s the case and not blow up buildings etc and make up stories.</p>

<p>To actually answer the question, what <em>is</em> the reason we are in Afghanistan, I will give the only explanations that make sense to me: 1) heroin -- Drugs = money; 2) control over fossils fuels; 3) control over territory (empire); 4) human attraction to war</p>

<p><strong><em>1. Heroin -- Drugs = Money</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>3. Control over territory</em></strong></p>

<p>This is nothing new -- Central Asia has always been important.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Game">Strategic rivalry and conflict between the British Empire and the Russian Empire for supremacy in Central Asia</a></p>

<p><strong><em>4. Human attraction to war</em></strong></p>

<p>How did all of these aggressive, largely unethical motivations result in an invasion and continued occupation?  The best explanation I have heard is the theory given in the book <em>The Psychology of War : Comprehending Its Mystique and Its Madness</em>.</p>

<p>Basically, the idea is that &#39;mythical thinking&#39; (as opposed to observation and rational  thought) makes it possible to engage in activities (wars) that solve the most basic age-old human dilemma: the conflict between self and the group.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.popmatters.com/books/reviews/p/psychology-of-war.shtml">http://www.popmatters.com/books/reviews/p/psychology-of-war.shtml</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is solid, it explains the problem pretty well.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists aren&#39;t automatically crazy, no one is really, but the fact that they occupy themselves with modern esoterica and occultism rather than the very real, very obvious things governments are doing to their people worldwide is suspect and frankly misses the point. If you take care of the people exploiting the populations of the world, you&#39;ve taken care of any nefarious occult knowledge within that group as well. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t change the world by talking about occultism, the professional occultists have known that for millennia. Calling people &#39;sheeple&#39; and dealing with paranoid schizophrenics like Alex Jones only discredits any claim to special knowledge, it just becomes another damn label to make &#39;you&#39; (generally speaking) seem more &#39;in the know&#39; and brighter than the general population.</p>

<p>Why are we worrying about who did WTC, when it&#39;s the <em>result</em> of that event that&#39;s fucking up everything the founding fathers intended for a free country? Why no screaming about these, the events and changes of policy that are actually effecting us today? Why don&#39;t we worry about reversing the rape of freedom&#39;s ideal represented by the Patriot Act and most other Bush-era 9/11 legislation, rather than devoting hours of lectures, radio programs and neuron cycles to whether 9/11 was an inside job? </p>

<p>What difference does it make if it was an inside job? We&#39;re dealing with the consequences of that, today. Sheeple indeed.</p>

<p>Does that not change your entire outlook on the ruling establishment? It&#39;s an incredibly difficult concept to wrap your mind around, and shakes one to the very core to believe their government could conspire to such a degree for war, death and empire.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you have acknowledged this very important fact of US history. Most (90%) of Americans would dismiss the Vietnam claim outright as a loony conspiracy theory, despite it being in the goddamned encyclopaedia entry for the Vietnam War.</p>

<p>their &quot;molding the world governments in a way that would serve our interests&quot; is the conspiracy theorists&#39; &quot;they&#39;re taking over the world for dysgenics&quot;. But let&#39;s argue out the details here. You admit they&#39;re molding the world, correct? In what way are they serving your interests? The iraq war wasn&#39;t for the American people. hussein was never a threat, never had wmd, had nothing to do with al-qaeda or 911. The same can be said of afghanistan and pakistan. So what interests of yours are being served? Did you get a tarp bail-out? Not at all. If anything, all this government spending will have to be paid in the future, and it&#39;s imho that&#39;s why they want to pass the health care bill since geithner and others won&#39;t discount higher taxes. In other words, they&#39;re spending tomorrow&#39;s money to pay for yesterday&#39;s debts. What does it take to show that your interests aren&#39;t being served?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I won&#39;t even try to argue that I&#39;m directly benefiting from the Iraq war, that&#39;s obviously not true.  I will say that the control of foreign oil does help the US as a whole.  Granted the corporations still try and fuck everyone else, but there is still economical benefits from the whole &quot;stealing oil&quot; business.  Unfortunately the whole war was so mismanaged by Bush &amp; Co. that it ended up being really bad for the country.  Say what you will about the crooks in business and Washington, but at the end of the day the US is still THE world power, which is good for all Americans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh? They&#39;re prepared and used to the statements typically made about conspiracy theories.

<p>And the second part has more to do with debate strategy in making your opponent show his hand early. Neither are particularly conspiratorial or connected to NSA. It seems you believe someone is NSA instead of knowing whether they are.</p>

<p>This is an interesting area. People are fed up with the slanted non-news they get from the media and big news channels like fox and cnn. Technology has enabled people to get information out that the mainstream channels won&#39;t touch for many different reasons, accuracy only being one of them. During the revolts in Iran for example, there was much more information available on the internet than I got from watching the news on TV. Most people get their news from the internet these days anyways and it&#39;s putting the news makers in an awkward place. I think they picked twitter as their first &quot;if you can&#39;t beat them, join them&quot; site because people are limited to 160 or so characters. Sound bytes. The media loves sound bytes. Now I&#39;m digressing.</p>

<p>Former Republican U.S. Sen. Dave Durenberger is questioning Ventura&#39;s claims. Durenberger, who spent eight years on the Senate intellegence committee, says he never heard of CIA operatives in state governments or agents grilling new governors.</p>

<p>&quot;I cannot think of a reason why either the details of, or his personal experiences with how he got elected would do anything for understanding threats to the United States and to our national security policy presented by foreign agents,&quot; he said. &quot;It doesn&#39;t jibe. Unless Jesse had another life that he either wrote about in this book or has yet to disclose to us prior to becoming our governor. It sort of like blows even my imagination to think of how this could be a reality.&quot;</p>

<p>CIA finances and personnel are classified. But Durenberger said he thinks the agency would be stretched to assign operatives to every state capitol and send 23 agents to attend the same meeting. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The reason the government can get away with locking people up is because the culture supports it.  In other words, when the government DOES arrest someone and say they are crazy for making an accusation against them, most people on reddit and elsewhere <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/96tvu/heavily_armed_glenn_beck_fan_arrested_at_national/">say &quot;Yup, that person is crazy&quot;</a> (the word &#39;crazy&#39; currently appears 20 times in the comments).</p>

<p>I counted the crazy-ish words:</p>

<p>delusion 2</p>

<p>crazy 20</p>

<p>insane 3</p>

<p>kooky 1</p>

<p>paranoia 3</p>

<p>paranoid 3</p>

<p>schizophrenia 1</p>

<p>nut 4</p>

<p>nutter 3</p>

<p>total: 40</p>

<p>The problem is that if you actually listen to what Alex Jones, Jordan Maxwell, Peter Joseph, Webster Tarpley and a lot of other people are saying, you will become convinced that some of this is true, <em>unless</em> you dismiss the accusations out of hand because they are extreme.  They are very convincing arguments and rarely are their claims refuted with facts or logic -- generally people just dismiss the accusations because they &quot;sound crazy&quot;.  That&#39;s not logic. Regardless of what we think of the actual truthfulness of the claims or their intentions they have a lot of convincing verifiable logic and facts in their arguments. </p>

<p>A person who is convinced by some of these people that the government really does intend to imprison and kill millions of people, or made to be extremely suspicious, would actually be quite sane to arm him or her self.</p>
