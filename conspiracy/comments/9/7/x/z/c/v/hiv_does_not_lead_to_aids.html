        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Contrary to popular belief (mockingbird media) - HIV has never been established as the cause of AIDs. Surely people know the difference between causation and correlation, only a slight correlation between HIV positivity and death from AIDs has been established. I will run through the bullet points that most AIDs Questioners hold as beliefs. </p>

<p>- Per the DHHS the HTLV virus contaminated Gallo&#39;s HIV genome, this was found in 1992 - 8 years after Gallo&#39;s landmark discovery. By this time most of the original AIDs patients were dead. </p>

<p>&quot;In June 1992, the NIH investigation was superseded by the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) at the <strong>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</strong>, and in December of that year ORI found both Gallo and Popovic guilty of scientific misconduct&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-12-31/news/9204280756_1_dr-gallo-french-virus-scientific-misconduct">http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-12-31/news/9204280756_1_dr-gallo-french-virus-scientific-misconduct</a></p>

<p>- No evidence exists that suggests the current HIV genome is any different from Gallo&#39;s 1984 discovery</p>

<p>- The patent for HIV is still held by Gallo and Montagnier - why would they claim the patent if it had changed at all (Note people will attempt to confuse this with test patent, no HIV is a patent like the Flu so that there is a global baseline)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;amp;tbm=pts&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=HIv+ininventor:gallo&amp;amp;num=10">https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=pts&amp;hl=en&amp;q=HIv+ininventor:gallo&amp;num=10</a></p>

<p>- Anyone who is HIV positive and dies will be marked as an AIDs death - an example is Alexis Arquette who died of a heart attack (an accepted side effect of HIV medicine) is marked as an AIDs death despite again not being an AIDs defining illness.</p>

<p>- The CDC stopped publishing the cause of death for HIV patients in 2002 - most of the deaths before this were associated with side effects of the medince not AIDs defining illness. I assume this is why the CDC stopped sharing this data.</p>

<p>The simple fact that most people are unaware that the HIV genome was discovered as having HTLV should be enough to highlight the level of this fraud. </p>

<p>Well, ozone therapy is not really a well-established form of treatment, at least not in the modern world. Isn&#39;t that where you use ozone, essentially, as a germicide to treat viruses/diseases/etc.? That was very, very popular in the late 1800&#39;s - luckily, modern medicine has come very far since those days. </p>

<p>My understanding is that, in order to be effective, ozone as germicide has to be at such extremely concentrated levels that most humans (or living things in general) would die as a result of exposure (see <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=801.415">https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=801.415</a>). It&#39;s kind of hard to maintain a working medical license when you&#39;re using treatment that has been shown to be harmful, no?</p>

<p>And at the very least, I would think the issue of Willner&#39;s self-injection is moot - he died before it could be confirmed whether or not he contracted the virus. So his stunt really proved nothing without a follow-up. In addition, do we even know that he used the actual virus in the injection? An individual who has previously gotten his license revoked for using therapy that is not effective isn&#39;t exactly the most trustworthy individual...why are we to accept, without question, that his actions were authentic?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not aware of any abuse or slander - just legitimate objections to his methods. I also think people tend to get upset when they claim they know better than 99% of established science. After all, why hasn&#39;t anyone taken up Montagnier&#39;s work? Why haven&#39;t they developed his theories in a lab, where his methods can be tested and proven?</p>

<p>How does that one small quote (out of a massive research text, mind you) disprove anything related to HIV? You seem to be educated enough to be able to write a massive thesis on the subject, so, please, tell me why that <em>one</em> quote disproves the existence of HIV?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The other one is from 1983 or a year before HIV was discovered, so I dont even know... what that is supposed to suggest...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The paper you just claimed has nothing to do with HIV discovery was one of the key and seminal publications that put HIV on the map. </p>

<p>Let me ask you a question - why are denialists so incapable of producing any evidence? Rather than producing a published and peer-reviewed document or even a research study, all denialists do is attempt to pick apart existing research. So many of the ones who make a living off of denialism end off dying of...wait for it...AIDS-related complications. Funny how just snapping your fingers and saying, &quot;HIV/AIDS isn&#39;t real!&quot; doesn&#39;t actually prevent you from dying. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re so certain that the research is <em>wrong</em>, please rush to your nearest research institution and start working on a new publication. It would quite literally change the world.</p>

<p><em>”The out-of-court agreement, announced jointly by French prime minister Jacques Chirac and US president Ronald Reagan, stipulated that each of the two parties had equal rights to claim priority concerning detection and isolation of the virus, and Gallo and Montagnier would henceforth be recognised as the “co-discoverers” of HIV – a stipulation also included in a Chronology of AIDS research co-authored by the two in Nature on 2 April 1987.”</em> (<a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-12-31/news/9204280756_1_dr-gallo-french-virus-scientific-misconduct/3">http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-12-31/news/9204280756_1_dr-gallo-french-virus-scientific-misconduct/3</a>) </p>

<p>So how do you know if you can’t access the private records? 
I have no legal basis for requesting access to this woman’s private medical history. You should know this – especially since you claim to be so knowledgeable on medical issues. 
Yes I’m sure the LA times will tell an accurate story. 
Why wouldn’t they? They’re an established, award-winning publication. I certainly trust them more than I trust some random dude on the internet.
What does pneumonia treatment 6 mos before death have to do with cause of death. 
Maybe that it shows that, six months before her death, she was suffering from one of the most common infections related to HIV (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2835537/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2835537/</a>)? It’s also important to note that since the widespread use of antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis in these patients, that specific type of pneumonia has declined.
Is there evidence of a pneumonia test? 
The Coroner’s office was able to confirm the infection, otherwise they wouldn’t have attributed her death to it. In addition, her personal family doctor wouldn’t have come out and made a statement to the effect that had she sought HIV treatment, her death was preventable. Again, I consider a coroner’s office and a medical official to have a significant amount of more credibility than some guy on the internet that thinks anyone can access anyone’s medical records. 
I know we are saying Pnuempnia but as you know it is a Pneumo Cystis Jiroveci and requires a test for diagnosis. I’m sure you knew that...why would you spread incorrect information about someone you never met? 
Yep, I’m aware of the specific pneumonia we’re discussing. And it’s interesting that you’re accusing me of spreading incorrect information – I’ve used published and peer-reviewed sources and you’ve used, well, a whole bunch of faulty logic and conjecture to “prove” your point.
It seems like you’re unaware of a lot of basic hiv information. Maybe you should understand the basics before getting in over your head.
I don’t have a medical degree, you’re correct, but I’m assuming you don’t either. So your attempt to reject or disqualify me from this discussion is as faulty as your attempt to come off as an expert.</p>

<p>Question - what do you think of prEP and the advancements it has made in bringing down HIV infection? In its early trials, it reduced new HIV infection in the San Francisco area by almost half (<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/03/daily-pill-can-prevent-hiv-infections-why-don-t-more-people-use-it">http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/03/daily-pill-can-prevent-hiv-infections-why-don-t-more-people-use-it</a>). If HIV hasn’t been discovered, or doesn’t exist, why are the very drugs that were developed to treat HIV infection actively decreasing the amount of new HIV infections? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gallo wasn&#39;t the only one to look at HIV. He wasn&#39;t the only one to provide HIV research. HIV confirmation has been studied by thousands of scientists around the world and sequenced countless of times. The sequence of HIV is fundamentally different that the sequence of any HTLV virus. </p>

<p>Within a given sequence, there are many short areas that a restriction endonuclease can cut. For example TTAGA might be one or AGGGA might be another. Such sequences may be 900 bp apart from one another. If you combine the restriction endonuclease with the HIV dna for example, and a 900 bp chunk comes out after running it on a gel, then you have some confirmation. You can also take the same chunk of DNA, clean it up from the gel, and sequence it. If there is not enough of the DNA, you can amplify it via PCR and sequence it. </p>

<p>If you are suggesting that I was still working with HTLV, that virus is more simple than HIV-1. It lacks, vpr, vpu, tat, rev, nef, the same structure for a packing signal, the same location for a packing signal, a nuclear localization signal within the nucleocapsid protein of the gag gene and on and on. It is still a complex and fascinating virus though. </p>

<p>I&#39;d suggest you go to a community college and enroll in a molecular biology class with a lab component. Learning some of these assays is a pretty good way to understand how gels, sequencing, cloning, PCR, and other tools of the trade work. I mean this with sincerity. If my daughter is  still interested in this type of stuff when she gets to high school, I intend on finding a class that she can take as well. It is really great stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gallo didn’t patent the HIV genome. The patent claims don’t pertain to that. Also see Diamond v. Chakrabarty. If you are suggesting that HIV is HTLV 1 or 2, you are woefully mistaken. The accessory genes of those viruses and the conserved  accessory genes of lentivirus aren’t similar.</p>

<p>Also, none of this really gets to the point of HIV causing aids. The envelope proteins can fuse T4 cells to infected cells and prevent interference from the infected cells own membrane receptors (CD4 and cxcr4 or ccr5) through expression of vpu and nef.</p>

<p>Anyway, you haven’t properly applied the patent claims of gallo. Even then, He wouldn’t have a patent  from every country in the world even if the claims were read as you suggested. A university in Tokyo, Sidney, Amsterdam and the like would have just as easily been able to isolate and sequence the provirus and publish the sequence. Publishing a naturally occurring sequence isn’t something that the government can stop. </p>

<p>Lastly your insistence on proper calibration of PCR machines is weird and I’m not sure makes sense. You could calibrate temperature and time the way could do in BBQ grill equipment or your air conditioner, but I don’t think you are talking about that.</p>

<p>Anyway, I got my PhD studying lentiviruses for years before becoming a patent attorney. Keeping this argument going is counterproductive. I’m sure you will point out that I didn’t answer some question and therefore you “win”. I’d say feel free to contract HIV, skip any meds, and see how that goes, but AIDS isn’t pleasant. So stay healthy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I keep beating my head against the wall on that one. The guy really needs a basic molecular biology class with a lab component. There are absolutely things that need to be calibrated. A thermocycler isn’t one of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny this comes up around here, I just got 2 new PCR systems at work. They were like &quot;hey man, you want to figure these out in addition to the 100 other things you don&#39;t got time for already?&quot; I was like &quot;OK, I guess&quot; . But man these are my new favorite toys in the lab. I&#39;m like PCR all the things!</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m no expert yet, but this guy doesn&#39;t make any sense. </p>
