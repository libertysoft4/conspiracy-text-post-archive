<p>9-11, passengers made phone calls to their loved ones, before they were whisked away from public view. One of them left a message, saying &quot;you need to listen very carefully.&quot; And ended the call with a whispered alert, that sounds very like &quot;It&#39;s a frame&quot;</p>

<p>Why isn&#39;t this discussed more here? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like &quot;Hit the frame&quot; which would make sense in the context of them either trying to break down a door, break a suitcase to make a weapon or tool from it, or any other number of perfectly reasonable reasons to say &quot;Hit the frame.&quot;  </p>

<p>Saying &quot;It&#39;s a frame&quot; would not make any sense under any circumstances.  A woman on the plane is in on the plot and telling everyone &quot;its a frame&quot; and yet no one asks any questions?  Presumably, if there was a woman explaining that &quot;it&#39;s a frame,&quot; the woman&#39;s call would have said, &quot;Hold on, baby, a woman is telling us all that this is a government setup and that George Bush is behind the whole thing.  I&#39;m going to die, but make sure people know that Bush set the whole thing up just like this woman is saying.&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole point of the Lyles story is that she couldn&#39;t have called from the plane. Her husband claims that his caller ID showed her cell number, but cell phones don&#39;t work from altitude or at 500mph. Therefore the call was made from the ground and likely under duress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is this call, the one that is linked to in this article the &quot;Lyles&quot; call?  If so, assuming it is a fake, then why would anyone care what about the content of the call?  And the evidence that the call was faked is her husbands statement that her cell number appeared?  There is not log of it?  He would get her cell phone bill in the mail and it would have a record of the call.  Why should we rely on someone&#39;s statement when conclusive documents would prove it one way or the other.  I haven&#39;t looked into this issue, so maybe he did release the phone records, but it seems like this one would be a no brainer.  If its not on the bill, then its from a government shill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. It&#39;s a real phone call, made from her cell, from the ground, presumably where the passengers were offloaded.</p>

<p>As for the cell phone records--thats a very interesting story. Evidently for the Moussaoui trial.for some inexplicable reason the FBI didn&#39;t bother to provide a full accounting of the cell phone records. Some say it&#39;s because the defense might have challenged the veracity of the calls by proving they had to have been made from the ground--a fact fatal to the official narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The recorded call that&#39;s presented here was made from an airfone. She made another call 10 minutes later from her cell phone but it&#39;s not clear if that was ever connected. These calls were made at when the plane was still in the air and was still being tracked by radar, so if you want to believe that they were making the calls on the ground, you have to increase your conspiracy to include the air traffic controllers and any military or civilian aircraft or bases that also tracked the flight. Then you have to ask why they bothered to offload them and let them make phone calls when they could have just crashed the plane in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lyles made two calls: the one linked to here was made at 9.47 from a GTE airfone. She made another call, at 9.58, from a cell phone, but I can&#39;t find out if that one connected. All the Flight 93 calls, except for this one and one from Edward Felt (also at 9.58) were made from airfones, so the issue of cell phones not working at altitude doesn&#39;t come into play.</p>

<p>We you might hear as &quot;it&#39;s a frame&quot; might to me sound like &quot;it&#39;s a shame&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s ok&quot;.  Or something totally different.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. Here&#39;s another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYG2oZXSvdE">classic example – the imagined  back masking on <em>Stairway to Heaven</em></a>. It sounds to me like this noise comes <em>after</em> she&#39;s hung up. You can hear her voice breaking in the last few sentences and a click after she says goodbye, then the claimed speaking. How do we know it wasn&#39;t some artifact after the call?</p>

<p>Truthers are so desperate to find evidence of a conspiracy that they don&#39;t even stop to really think about what they&#39;re suggesting. Even if someone did say &quot;It&#39;s a frame&quot;, that&#39;s not a term I&#39;ve ever heard used for a conspiracy. A &quot;frame-up&quot; is setting someone else up to take the fall for something, but that&#39;s clearly not what was said. It&#39;s like claiming that &quot;pull it&quot; is a recognised term for controlled demolition, when people actually in the demolition business have said it&#39;s not. And why would someone be trying to leave a message that it was all a conspiracy anyway? If they&#39;re willing participants, there&#39;s no reason for them to do so. If they&#39;re not, why would they be allowed anywhere near a phone? And I thought these calls were all faked anyway?</p>

<ul>
<li>the passengers of the planes were evacuated</li>
<li>they were forced to make the calls</li>
<li>they were instructed to abide by a &quot;script&quot; of sorts that included the hijacking, etc</li>

<p>I thought the language of &quot;its a frame&quot; was weird too, but I&#39;m not sure what words you are supposed to whisper before hanging up that will effectively convey the right message. </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it be a hell of a lot easier, logistically, to just keep the people on the plane, and instead of dealing with all the hassle of kidnapping and executing that many people, just do whatever needed to be done to the plane to make it work with your theory?</p>

<p>Like, if you need explosives or something, it&#39;d be a million times simpler to change out their luggage rather than kidnapping/executing all those people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not claiming to be right, but any stuff I&#39;ve ever looked at regarding the no planes theory suggests that despite the speeds the metal wings and body of the plane shouldn&#39;t have been capable of doing that much damage. In the idea you&#39;ve proposed, maybe there would be potential that the explosives would go off not at their intended target but rather the exterior of the building, or just at the point of impact? </p>

<p>My hypothesis in a nutshell on this is that the drone is effective simply because it could penetrate far deeper into the building and the explosives would set off there, as opposed to a regular plane. But the no planes theory is not something I&#39;m completely sold on as of yet. The most damning aspect of it is the speeds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But why would they abide by the script? She says they&#39;d heard that other planes had been crashed into the Twin  Towers, so they must have had a pretty pessimistic outlook, so why didn&#39;t she just say &quot;we&#39;re being held captive&quot;? That&#39;s what I, and I suggest most people, would do. Instead, we&#39;re supposed to believe that she whispers this line in front of her captors and then they let it slide? This huge conspiracy that makes planes and their passengers vanish without a trace but they can&#39;t make a line in a tape recording disappear?</p>

<p>And why did they need the passengers to make the calls at all? Why didn&#39;t those who spoke live to others give the game away? Again, as soon as the other party picked up I&#39;d have just shouted I was being held hostage. It makes zero sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Stairway to Heaven back masking is an incredibly interesting phenomenon. A while back a couple friends and I decided to figure out how it worked. We had a little cassette recorder and I tried to sing the line in question “yes there are two paths.....” and flipped the tape around to hear what it sounded like. What I sang when reversed sounded nothing at all like Stairway did when reversed. My friend noticed that I had sung the line in a slightly different key, and decided he would try to sing the line in the same key as the recording. What we heard when we reversed his singing was shocking, the same words you hear on Stairway were now clear as day ( I forget what all they are it’s been a long time) “my sweet Satan.......”. It was super creepy. So wasn’t the words that create the sounds, it’s the words, melody, and key all working together to create another element in reverse. </p>

<p>To take it one step farther my friend who had the success singing the forward line would now sing the backwards line and see if it would reverse to the original forward line. The record button is pushed and on he sings “my sweet Satan.....” but enunciated the reverse lyrics much more clearly and I shit you not, when reversed the output is now clear as day “yes there are two paths you can go down......” the normal forward lyrics from Stairway. </p>

<p>The whole experience was creepy to say the least, and if nothing else convinced me there is more to the world than we know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;ve done some experimentation with this. Getting sounds to reverse a certain way is actually quite tricky, but it&#39;s something you can account for. With just a little practice, it&#39;s possible to get sounds to reverse into strangely accented, but very recognizable words. Once you know the right sounds, it would then just be a matter of producing things in the right combination so that the right sounds get emphasized, and others get drowned out, to produce the combination you want. Difficult, but by no means impossible.</p>

The only slightly recognisable sound I heard was the &quot;Satan&quot; sound (and I was already primed for that from knowing the claims about the track).

But I&#39;m sure someone could have come up with a totally innocent alternative wording that would have sounded equally accurate.</p>

<p>If you can post someone singing &quot;there are two paths&quot; and then reverse it, I would be interested to see if it&#39;s as clear as you remember.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, &quot;frame&quot; is not relevant at all. Why would she think someone was being framed? Did the baddies explain the whole plot to her, james Bond style, before giving her the phone? It would have been obvious to them they were in a very grim situation (she says she heard other planes were crashed), so why would she leave a cryptic message when she could have just said &quot;we&#39;re being held captive&quot;? And why would they have had them make the calls at all? They weren&#39;t needed. Remember, the calls were also made when the plane was still being tracked on radar, so they weren&#39;t offloaded to some secure base when they made them.</p>

<p>To explain away these gaping logical holes, you have to start imagining all sorts of convoluted scenarios to explain them away. And the more convoluted they have to become, the less likely they are.</p>

<p>The secret is frequency. The acoustic information that makes us hear Yanny is higher frequency than the acoustic information that makes us hear Laurel. ...Older adults tend to start losing their hearing at the higher frequency ranges, which could explain why Riecke could only hear Laurel, but his eight-year-old daughter could hear Yanny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another theory is that it&#39;s &quot;you did great&quot; at the end. The theory was that these calls were made from the ground and the &quot;you did great&quot; was the voice of a handler, who was directing what was to be said.</p>

<p>It could also just be another airline hostess offering reassurance to her colleague, who has just had to make a very difficult phone call ... but I don&#39;t buy into that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the plane was still in the air (as tracked by radar) when the call was made, so where did the handlers come from? Plus, if you believe that this calls is genuine, that puts you at odds with all those Truthers who say the calls were impossible. So, now you have to fake the radar tracks, land the plane, and force the passengers to make fake calls, when there was no need for them to do that at all. Why let them anywhere near a phone? It just needlessly complicates an already ridiculously Byzantine plot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not my theory, just one I&#39;ve read a little about.</p>

<p>The theory was the planes landed after the transponders were switched off, think operation Northwoods. The real planes landed and were told they were part of a military drill taking place and to make the calls, or the passengers/crew were forced to make the calls before being ... &quot;taken care of&quot;. The calls were made from the ground, hence the handlers. </p>

<p>Again not my theory, but it&#39;s one I&#39;ve read. The only thing I don&#39;t believe about 9/11 is the official story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn’t a unified conspiracy theory though. It’s people speculating on what might have happened instead.</p>

<p>Ignore that and just look at if the questions posed by people who question 9/11 are adequately answered by the official story. Are the answers consistent with what we know about science?</p>

<p>I would argue that just asking questions as to why Bush and Cheney was allowed to give their testimony to the 9/11 behind closed doors and not under oath despite Cheney being responsible for the actions of planes that could’ve intercepted the hijacked planes would be a start. I’d also ask what job you would fail so spectacularly at and still get promoted like Chertoff? </p>

<p>Was procedure followed on 9/11? Why was it so ineffective if it was official procedure? Was procedure changed in the lead-up to 9/11? Who changed it?</p>

<p>Why were various warnings ignored by multiple people? Why were Saudi Nationals related to bin Laden allowed to leave without being questioned? Why was the evidence from a major crime scene shipped off to China? Why were there bets against United Airlines before 9/11? Who made those bets? Why was it so important for lawyers to have all possible families that could sue reach settlements? How can a guy buy a building, have a huge insurance payout added if the building was impacted by terrorism and not be questioned? Why did the US not go to war with Saudi Arabia and invaded Iraq and Afghanistan instead?</p>

<p>Seeing as the people on the 9/11 commission said their hands were tied I’d say it confirms the inquiry was ineffective. Maybe it would have been better if Henry Kissinger had been the man leading the commission as they wanted initially </p>

<p>That’s without even looking at the neocon docs saying we need a new pearl harbour so we can go to war in the exact places they went to war. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The closest planes weren&#39;t close enough to shoot them down and didn&#39;t have much ammo anyway. (The pilots were reportedly planning to crash their planes into Flight 93 to bring it down.) One of the reasons they were so ill-prepared was that they just weren&#39;t anticpating intercepting attacking aircraft originating from within the US – they&#39;d assumed that any attackers would be coming from outside.</p>

<p>As for the hour long call, you&#39;re probably remembering either Todd Beamer&#39;s or Jeremy Glick&#39;s cals (1hr 5min and 2hr 6min repectively). But they weren&#39;t made after the plane had gone down and no one was talking after the plane had gone down; the lines were just left open for that length of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You missed out his next line: &quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking.&quot; Or, in other words, at that time he thought a cell phone couldn&#39;t be used. The call was made just eight minutes before the plane hit the ground and the aircraft would have been below 10,000 feet at that point, so it is possible for cell phones to have been used.</p>

<p>I like how the conspirators are so brilliant that they plan this all out, manage to somehow make that plane invisible to radar so they can land it and offload all the passengers while another plane continues the radar trace, but they&#39;re also so dumb that they do all that just to let the passengers make potentially risky phone calls that serve zero purpose.</p>

<p>Assuming you&#39;re referring to the object Greg Johnson photographed, do you have links to the other &quot;legit pictures&quot;, because I&#39;ve only been able to find the one he took. And, given that it was a 20-second exposure, it must have been a really big missile to have produced such a large &quot;missile&quot; shape in the photo.</p>

<p>Also, do you have links for where the &quot;MSM called it lens flare? I see that a spokesperson for NAS Whidbey Island said it may have been lens flare, but I don&#39;t see the MSM saying that. (Unless you&#39;re suggesting they made the spokesperson up.) I guess when even the photographer says he&#39;s 99 per cent convinced it was a helicopter the MSM lost interest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, I don&#39;t follow people. I research and make up my own mind. This is what I wrote this about Q on a local forum not even a week after I discovered it in March I think.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do believe that stuff exists but it&#39;s not just all on the Democrats and Clinton&#39;s in Obama. I don&#39;t know to what extent that they are all involved or if they are at all though. With everything that&#39;s been going on recently, I am starting to believe in this one world globalist conspiracy to destroy America and create a one-world government. I&#39;ve been hearing about all this stuff since the time I was very young and surprisingly enough to me, it has been coming true. The problem is, the right-wingers who believe in this stuff are perpetuating the problem. We&#39;re all fighting each other, liberals versus conservatives, black versus white, immigrant vs. Citizen. And due to the right Wingers narcissism, they are feeding right into their role in the destabilization process to destroy America. Trump is a Trojan Horse. They will never question him now and they will fight for him to the death. Not realizing that they are orchestrating the very thing that they have feared the most, the destruction of America. They have been blinded by their own arrogance to not realize that they are being used as puppets. That&#39;s what I think this whole QAnon thing is about.</p>

<p>I will say that there&#39;s definitely some truthtelling going on with Q Anon because he is predicting some future events although vaguely. My conclusion so far is that it is a mind control operation. They are telling them everything they want to hear about how there is a secret plan to get the Democrats, Obama, the Clintons. That Trump is actually truly a genius and what you see on TV is all just an act to fool people to whats really going on. This achieves a lot of things, it feeds into their narcissistic delusions that they were right all along. Trump really is a genius and the Democrats really are evil. This helps relieve the cognitive dissonance between what they believe and what reality is. Once they lock into this belief system, they will never let go of it. Especially because it will be impossible to disprove and their narcissism won&#39;t allow them to accept that they have been fooled. By Q mixing provable truths with unprovable lies, he&#39;s blinding these Trump supporters using their own arrogance and getting them to believe all of it. While everyone else just thinks they&#39;re crazy conspiracy theorists which will just push them further into their delusions. Q is creating blind loyal soldiers for Trump by changing their very perception of reality. He is actually framing this as a battle between good and evil, God and Satan. This is not a joke to them. They believe that this has all been foretold in the Bible and they are doing God&#39;s work. But their arrogance has blinded them to one thing, Satan is the teller of lies but he presents himself as an angel of Light. Q is an agent of Satan and they are unknowingly doing his bidding.</p>

<p>I know it is easy to dismiss the significance of this Q guy in the context that I am putting him in but ask yourself this, why would someone with this amount of insider knowledge go through all this amount of trouble just to create this kind of support for Trump unless it was for purely good or purely evil reasons? If it is for purely good reasons, then everything Q is saying is absolutely true, which seems pretty much impossible to be honest. If it is for evil reasons, then it is either someone close to Trump that only truly cares about staying power at the expense of everything else or it is a possible foreign agent that is trying to ensure that there are still loyal Trump supporters when his presidency is threatened in order to cause civil unrest and possibly Civil War. This isn&#39;t some small fringe conspiracy theory anymore, it is spreading like wildfire now.</p>

<p><strong>2 Thessalonians 2</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him, we ask you, brothers and sisters, 2 not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by the teaching allegedly from us—whether by a prophecy or by word of mouth or by letter—asserting that the day of the Lord has already come. 3 Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness[a] is revealed, the man doomed to destruction. 4 He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God’s temple, proclaiming himself to be God.</p>

<p>5 Don’t you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things? 6 And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time. 7 For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way. 8 And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming. 9 The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie, 10 and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. 11 For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie 12 and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.</p>

<p>I want to bring special attention to this bolded and underlined part. </p>

<p><strong>They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. 11 For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie 12 and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.</strong></p>

<p>This conspiracy theory is spreading. Big online news sites are writing about it. Russia Today has talked about it (that should tell us something). Hannity has tweeted about it and I&#39;ve heard about it on Joe Rogan&#39;s podcast two different times now. These are just the instances that I found by accident. We have a group of people now, no matter how small they may be, that believe that Trump is pretty much God because he is fighting a battle between good and evil for the sake of America and the world. These are the type of people who have gun caches and have been waiting for this battle their whole lives. In their own arrogance they apparently rewrote the Bible to include some sort of new Messiah that didn&#39;t come from the clouds to take out the Antichrist and bring about the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth for the next 1000 years like the Bible says Jesus is supposed to do. Instead they exalted one who cares only about Earthly things, Earthly desires and the only Kingdom he cares about is the Earthly Kingdom of America. They then ascribe to him the righteousness of God through their own minds and then confirm that righteousness through a modern day online (false) prophet to solidify their narcissistic delusion beyond reproach.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, man. It was suppose to be a lot more convincing. The first plane impact was supposed to initiate the demolition sequence on WTC1, and a second or two later, the demolition of WTC7 was supposed to commence as though falling debris from WTC1 &quot;took it out&quot;. </p>

<p>When the second plane hit WTC2 it too was supposed to collapse immediately. </p>

<p>Tens of thousands more were to have been killed, no witnesses to inexplicable explosions within the building were to have survived, and there wouldn&#39;t be  hundreds of hours of footage of the smouldering buildings from every angle available to us dastardly conspiracy theorists to pore over to this day. </p>

<p>The &quot;inside job&quot; was a complete clusterfuck, and I&#39;m sure the planners were in panic mode the instant they realized WTC1 was still standing after the first plane crash. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many debunkers ridicule the inside job theory by claiming that the government is too incompetent to pull off such a hugely complex false flag event so flawlessly.</p>

<p>Others take almost the opposite approach by saying that there&#39;s no way the plotters of the event would ever have designed so many glaring inconsistencies into their plan--such as having WTC2 go down before WTC1, or having WTC7 come down at all in such suspicious manner while the world watched. </p>

<p>Thing is they&#39;re both right. The government was too incompetent to pull it off, and had no intention of the Trade Towers falling the wrong order, nor for the obvious controlled demolition of be seen and recorded from every angle. </p>

<p>They wanted, as I said before, WTC1 to go down immediately after the impact of the first plane, and while the base of WTC7 was enveloped in that enormous dust cloud, it too would come down. Minutes later, in the chaos and confusion, WTC2 would suffer the same fate.</p>

<p>In this case the only footage of WTC1 going down would have been <a href="https://youtu.be/TCHSQPv65Jk?t=1m30s">that recorded by the somewhat suspiciously placed filmakers, the Naudet brothers</a>. And AFAIK no one would have had any footage of WTC7 going down at all. Certainly at that point very few cameras would have been pointed skyward to see the second plane incoming. </p>

<p>But because things went wrong, there&#39;s eye witness testimony like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/urNEAakzOYk">I think a bomb went off in the lobby first, and then the plane hit the building</a></p>

<p>And this:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/UPklTmoTGr8?t=23s">There were two separate explosions!</a></p>

<p>And this:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/NLlMXkWW_LM?t=3m22s">I heard a bomb...started toward the door again and there come a big blast</a></p>

<p>And this:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/NLlMXkWW_LM?t=4m10s">So it was a difference between coming from the basement and coming from the top</a></p>

<p>And this:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/NLlMXkWW_LM?t=5m13s">At first we believed it came from the mechanical room...and then we heard a series of other explosions that sounded up on the above levels</a></p>

<p>Basically the upshot is that there appears to have been bombs in basement and/or lobby that went off <em>before</em> the plane impact, and the only reason that makes any lick of sense for that, is that the planners intended the demolition of the building to be more or less simultaneous with the impact. This naturally would give everyone a clear cause and effect impression: plane hits building, building collapses. Any questions?</p>

<p>When things went to shit for the planners, I have to imagine that they went into troubleshooting mode, and eventually managed to trigger the demolition sequence of first WTC2, and then WTC1. WTC7 continued to give them problems, and I believe they actually sent people <a href="https://youtu.be/4mEztt5D-cU?t=3m33s">like this interesting fellow</a> into the building to sort it out. William Bennet, of the Office of Secure Transportation, was later convicted of selling cars stolen from ground zero.</p>

<p>Of course, even though it would look unbelievably suspicious, they still had no choice but to blow the building--it was loaded for bear, and it&#39;s not like they could let building engineers or inspectors in to find all the nanothermite charges and det cord strung out all over the core columns on floors 7-9 and 11-13. But why after sorting out the problem did they not wait til 3am instead of blowing it 5:20 in the evening? Two reasons: first, they couldn&#39;t possible blow the building after all the fires went out because how on earth could you explain that? Second is that they couldn&#39;t risk explosive flashes being recorded for all to see on the Morning View. </p>

<p>As for the nanothermite: according to David Chandler there were tons of unreacted nanothermite in the building dust, and I&#39;d say it&#39;s because of the incompetence of the inexpert building loaders used. It&#39;s not like the planners could hire from CD Inc or anything. They were likely using the IDF&#39;s best sappers, but obviously these guys were amateurs, thank goodness.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYj6PAJRZEg">Here what looks like some of the unreacted nanothermite igniting in the debris pile</a>.</p>

<p>Hope you find this interesting. One day maybe I&#39;ll put together a comprehensive post. Or maybe you might if you want to pull on this string a little more. </p>

<p>We have no idea what the words were. &quot;It&#39;s a frame&quot; doesn&#39;t even make any sense. Think outside the conspiracy box. If someone was forcing her to make the call why would she then whisper that &quot;it&#39;s a frame&quot; as if her captures wouldn&#39;t hear that? </p>

<p>Once again I don&#39;t believe the official story at all..but these words could have been anything. It could have been a girl next to her saying &quot;its gonna be okay&quot; or &quot;we need to pray&quot; or some shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, the technology to take a few seconds of speech, and replicate it into a full conversation, existed before 9/11.  Many stories of families of victims on plane recite how &#39;odd&#39; sounding their family members&#39; phone calls were.  Must have been a shitty flight(s) to be on.   Send the fuckers to jail.. Yeah they don&#39;t like me posting this, but fuck &#39;em all. Go die in a fire you trash.   BTW, every person on earth now can be replicated by lifelike voice via the data collected by intelligence agencies. Every video can also be falsified.
