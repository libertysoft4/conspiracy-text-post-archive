        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Today&#39;s Blind Items - The Sacrifice - Bohemian Grove 2018</p>

<p>It has been well over three decades since the membership attempted this. Three decades of wanting to do so but afraid of the authorities who were anxious to learn any details about the two previous times it has known to have happened. It was fitting that it happened in that special room with the initials to begin the name. The two organizers of the sacrifice are two of the very top officials of the organization that resembles that room name.</p>

<p>They brought with them, a special guest. For one of the very few times ever, a woman was allowed inside the grounds. The foreign born escorts are actually ensconced in a secure area that is not within the camp itself. The only sex workers allowed on the grounds itself are the young men.</p>

<p>The special guest is A+ list in every sense of the word. All of you know who she is. She has also engaged in some of the most bizarre sex acts with each of the two men mentioned earlier. She has traveled the world with these men, separately and together, engaging in sex acts while pretending to be compassionate. Brutalizing young girls and women to fulfill whatever sick desires they have, knowing they do so with impunity because they are above all laws in those places. They control the law. They control the news. They control it all. The power has gone to their head.</p>

<p>The A+ lister has always felt a connection with the event because it is one originally established for artists and still pays lip service to that original mandate.</p>

<p>She brought two tweens with her. One male and one female. She began by drawing blood from herself and spreading it over her body before spreading it on the tweens. The tweens were then pricked with a needle and some of their blood was drawn which was then marked on all those who wanted to participate. Those who were chosen to participate then were allowed to explore the tweens how they wanted while our A+ lister encouraged them and participated herself When every man had finished what they had started, two large men came into the room who had not been there previously and took the tweens away. Most people assume they were set aflame in the annual ritual. Some people think they were given as trophies to a member who has been a long time supporter and has a fondness for young boys and girls.</p>

<p>Crazy Days and Nights has usually had some interesting stories but I can&#39;t ever recall them covering Bohemian Grove.</p>

<p>Guarantee that they watch these and other forums to see if their message is getting coverage. Especially when there are so few people who talk about what they cover until it is re-covered in a MSM source.</p>

Mainly talking about how they use males for sex ( underage and some not underage )  I also recall a blind about them considering opening it up to women for membership.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t sound like the 30 years is talking about the woman? I was under the impression it was Jolie as well with all her work with foreign children. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it is a good guess. I don&#39;t know for sure but I just think with all the hints to her blood ritual stuff and some of these other clues it might be Jolie.

    <div class="md"><p>I just checked and Jolie was born in 1975.  I don&#39;t doubt that she is/was involved in these ritual sacrifices, but probably not in the 1980&#39;s.  It is hard to say, though, because her father is famous...   Jolie was probably born into it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No she probably wasn&#39;t involved in the ones three decade ago but that isn&#39;t exactly how the blind is worded. It just sounds like it has been a while since they attempted something like this possibly with a different woman.  She could&#39;ve been on of the children then though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe this isn&#39;t even anything to mention. I&#39;ve been a fan of Falco&#39;s for a little over 20 years. Yes, I know how off the wall that is. Still enjoy him and his music. Reason why I bring him up is there was talks for Falco to do a duet with Madonna in the 80s. He dragged his feet on it. Goodness knows I like the man, sometimes he made some questionable decisions when it concerned his career. I often assumed he was snubbing that duet because he knew if it was a hit, all credit would go to Madonna and he&#39;d be overshadowed. Or perhaps Madonna would rake his ass over the coals if he tried any stunts in the studio (showing up shitfaced when he&#39;s there to work, that kinda stuff) He did end up doing a duet and with somebody that&#39;s completely off the wall in the questionable department when you think of what a step down this was....the opportunity to do a duet with Madonna and instead he goes with Brigitte Nielsen. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xH8Wqdb4U0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xH8Wqdb4U0</a> still, it seems rather odd he can&#39;t bite the bullet if this will really open more doors for him career wise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha!  I remember him.  I believe he died in a head on collision on some island.  I did not realize he was supposed to do a duet with Madonna, and I did not realize he did one with Brigitte Nielson, of all people.  This ought to be good...  I will look now.  Thanks!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If anybody else sees this post, check out Weiner Blut. You know it&#39;s gonna be a doozy when &quot;blood&quot; is pouring down on &#39;angels&quot; as the first shot. I realize the song was about political corruption in Austria. Thing is I think that video could apply towards all the corruption in the world. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMrwcix41sY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMrwcix41sY</a></p>

<p>And to be fair for those keeping track about &#39;selling souls&#39;--<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFYJ1quaHTc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFYJ1quaHTc</a> 3:00 mark is a section mentioning that</p>

<p>Falco&#39;s grave is also very interesting. There&#39;s an obelisk out there and there&#39;s a statue with a picture of him. It&#39;s the same picture from the Nachtflug album cover. Still an unusual kind of grave site imo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try this <a href="http://www.agcwebpages.com/BLINDITEMS/MAINPAGE.html">http://www.agcwebpages.com/BLINDITEMS/MAINPAGE.html</a>  They list all the blinds and occasionally some other stuff so you don&#39;t have to click any links like you do on the CDAN site.  They update pretty quickly.  I will read this site once a week and get all the blinds in about 20 minutes.  They also source it back to the CDAN site by clicking on the hyperlink for each blind listed</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been reading it for about a year and a half.  I would say they have about a 80 ish% accuracy rate.  Sometimes it doesn&#39;t happen exactly as they said it would but it still happens.  To be quite frank all these things are is gossip.  However, the big stuff they seem to be spot on.  </p>

<p>There was a blind last week talking about how Clive Davis booked a venue for a Aretha Franklin tribute concert before she was dead, then boom Aretha died yesterday.  Speaking of Aretha, the site has been talking about Aretha off and on for close to 9 months, they allege that she had HIV/AIDS and that&#39;s what was making her ill. </p>

<p>They have also documented Demi Lavato being smashed at industry events and stating concern for her.  We all know about the overdose.  What I have noticed in terms of rape allegations and child sex abuse is that if there is a blind about it generally within 60 days something pops up in the news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Madonna and beyonce come to mind. Madonna would add an extra level of spiritual irony given her name.</p>

<p>Recently read a similarly sickening story of an alleged survivor of a snuff film allegedly filled by Hunter Thompson. When flying back they dumped the body over brush where &quot;hooded men&quot; / Satanists would take care of the remains.</p>

<p>Hunter also mentions adrenochrome in fear and loathing. His buddy got it from a satanic alleged child molestor in the movie. Very odd.</p>

<p>Knowledge like that is suspect so I buy the bohemian grove/snuff stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t know why you got downvoted, I heard about some kid that was allegedly trafficked around the country for elites and at one point they landed and picked someone up that matched HT&#39;s description. I think that&#39;s what you&#39;re probably talking about. Hunter Thompson infiltrated groups like the Hell&#39;s Angels, is it really so out there that he would be investigating this kind of shit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. if anyone would be interested its him. Think he got too deep and that resulted in his end of life paranoia.</p>

<p>Probably the same story you saw; the recollection was gruesome.</p>
