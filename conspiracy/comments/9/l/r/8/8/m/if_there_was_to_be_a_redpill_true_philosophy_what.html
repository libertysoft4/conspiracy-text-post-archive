So I will be making a blog or a series of posts on voat detailing the true philosophy (krishna consciousness) which many have done before, and linking them to conspiracies (which fewer have done).</p>

<p>Since it is a religious system and a cult, I&#39;d like to hear which problems would you like the answers to first. I&#39;ll see which things I can address because Srila Prabhupada&#39;s main focus was to help us escape the matrix, not teach us more about the matrix (although he did that too, to a large extent) but he mostly focused on helping us escape.</p>

<p>Also, this is not a thread for atheists who want to bash on God. If you are inquisitive, good, if you are an atheist, please just move on to another post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Specifically, his advice is to let go of material desires and serve only spiritual desires. That is the way to true, eternal, lasting happiness. By nature, everything in the material world is temporary and illusory. Serving material desires engenders material bondage and traps us in this materialistic existence (the matrix). Think of all the demands on your time and you will realize this to be true. Karma and the cycle of birth and rebirths (reincarnation) keeps us chained to the material universe. So we need to clear our karma, and the only reliable and failsafe way to do it is to discharge devotional service to Lord Sri Krishna&#39;s divine lotus feet. Remember, even pious acts generate good karma, which will make you come back to the material world to be reborn as a sage, a person in a good family, or even a demigod.</p>

<p>Like when it refers to being reborn in a &#39;good life&#39; or a &#39;demigod&#39;; couldn&#39;t that be referring to the short term of how as we become better people day after day, how we are in a way &quot;born&quot; again back into consciousness every time we wake up. </p>

I love this series. The first audio here of osho talking about this Indian Buddhist bodhidharma gives a good summary of his approach. 
Very interesting take on spirituality but I&#39;m more interested in the political and economic state of the world for now. Leaving now would be like an Arhat.

    <div class="md"><p>If someone leaves their knowledge and experience remains with them so they remember not to make the mistake of leaving the spiritual world again. Can I have the source if you say otherwise? I&#39;d stay away from Osho if I were you, he doesn&#39;t acknowledge the supremacy of Lord Sri Krishna. One of the symptoms of Kali Yuga is that there will be many false and bogus gurus propounding mayavadi (impersonalistic) and shunyavadi (voidist) philosophies. Osho is one such guru. I just read this - <a href="https://www.osho.com/read/osho/osho-on-topics/krishna">https://www.osho.com/read/osho/osho-on-topics/krishna</a> - and it is full of errors and blatant misinformation.</p>

<p>If one doesn&#39;t know who and what God is, they can&#39;t be a guru. Guru means one who liberates from the darkness of ignorance. Meaning one who shows the path to escaping this material world and returning to the spiritual world. Srila Prabhupada is one such guru. Please stick to him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The human form of life is special and especially intended for God realization. This is the form of life in which we can escape the matrix and go back home, back to Godhead. The demigods are too materially opulent to be interested in liberation and krishna consciousness, and the birds, plants, and animals do not possess the required intelligence. We have the higher intelligence and so we have to elevate ourselves from the animalistic tendencies - eating, sleeping, mating, defending. But modern society is simply a society of polished animals who have superior facilities to satisfy the animal tendencies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As you already know, Earth during this time is Kali Maharaja&#39;s playground. Kali Maharajas influence is absolutely everywhere now. However, this Kali Yuga is special since Caitanya Mahaprabhu descended. It has been predicted by Bhaktivinoda Thakura that we are entering into a golden age which will last for the next 10,000 years. After that, it will resume as a normal Kali Yuga and get increasingly worse and worse.</p>

<p>Srila Prabhupada did not want us to focus so much on these external things going on in the world, because in reality they are not in the catagory of activities which nourish our eternal relationship with the Divine Couple. Nonetheless all these topics are EASILY explained through the lens of Vedic scripture. Everything is there.. aliens, nature of reality, everything you mentioned. The thing is that this isn&#39;t the best way to attract others into the line of devotional service. Harinama sankirtan is a much more effective method, and ultimately only those with enough sukriti will begin to seriously consider this path as the only path to salvation.</p>

<p>So what is our duty? We should absorb ourself in chanting, reading and performing service, and day by day increasing our relationship with Them. We should be crying for their mercy like a desperate begger.</p>

<p>However, its a very gradual process, and we are filled with anarthas, so our attention and energy will be going other places which we shouldnt. Thats why I am on these forums.</p>

I see so much misinformation - these people can be benefitted by having bona fide and authentic scriptural sources instead of rushing after youtube theories. I also think some of them may become aware of the vedic culture, and due to pious deeds (sukriti as you put it) and good karma of past lives, become interested in krishna consciousness and save themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Instead of contemplating what will happen to this world, you have got a short duration of life, say fifty, sixty years. You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and go back to home, back to Godhead. Don&#39;t consider what will happen to this world. The nature will take care of it. You don&#39;t puzzle your brain with these thoughts. You utilize whatever time you have got in your possession and go back to home, back to Godhead.  You cannot check it. Best thing is that you mold your life and go back to home, back to Godhead. &quot;Oil in your own machine.&quot; Instead of thinking what will happen... They will happen. Because people will go on with their rascal civilization, natural consequences will be there. You better take advantage of whatever time you have got and become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious and go back to home.&quot; - Srila Prabhupada morning walk</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you considered the possibility that &quot;reincarnation&quot; is just symbolism? </p>

<p>Like when it refers to being reborn in a &#39;good life&#39; or a &#39;demigod&#39;; couldn&#39;t that be referring to the short term of how as we become better people day after day, how we are in a way &quot;born&quot; again back into consciousness every time we wake up. </p>

I love this series. The first audio here of osho talking about this Indian Buddhist bodhidharma gives a good summary of his approach. 
Very interesting take on spirituality but I&#39;m more interested in the political and economic state of the world for now. Leaving now would be like an Arhat.
