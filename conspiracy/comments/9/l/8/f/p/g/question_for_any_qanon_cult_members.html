        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you really believe that democrats are fucking kids why don&#39;t you do something about it yourself instead of sitting around online sucking off trump.</p>

<p>I can say this now because none of it can be traced and someone has already been charged..</p>

<p>But I was an active member of APH..</p>

<p>Anonymous pedophile hunters..</p>

<p>We dug deep into some shit and I can tell you right now it&#39;s definitely not limited to democrats.
You think the catholic church is full of democrats just as a small example.
People are into pedophile shit but it&#39;s the elite in general.. Full spectrum both sides of the fence.
Certain individuals got raided by the feds so we couldn&#39;t leak alot of info.. Becaise it was gone..
We did find a website for a camp for children with disabilities..
On that same server was cp.. And that led to another server on the deep web that was nothing but cp.</p>

<p>We spent months of hard work trying to Crack the deep web servers because we knew once we got in there any servers would be cake..
Well someone finally did and it didn&#39;t necessarily go as planned but still..
One person went rouge.
Executed ddos scripts from all the servers and pointed it at cia.gov</p>

<p>And it went down for a few hours.. The logic was they would trace the attack and find all the wicked shit these people were doing..
I&#39;m not sure how the endgame panned out because 2 days later it was revealed sabu was a snitch and he had been logged in the channel the entire time it was all going down.
Jeremy Hammonds was charged for it but he wasn&#39;t even involved. The person who executed the attack vanished without a trace.. It&#39;s possible it was a fed but the point is.. We actually did something to try and stop fucking sick bastards like that. We didn&#39;t sit around and wait for some false prophet to give us direction.
If you really feel so passionate about it and the children being exploited then take action..</p>

<p>Oh but wait.. You really don&#39;t give a fuck because it&#39;s just a republican VS Democrat thing to you that matters most..</p>

<p>We risked our freedom.. Some of our comrades lost their freedom.. And even worse in an unjustified manner..</p>

<p>So either become a  weapon and stop being a pawn.. Or stfu and gtfo because you guys have a target on your back now and the ppl aiming for it actually care and won&#39;t sleep until justice is served.. No forgives no forgets.
Play time is over.</p>

<p>Thread will probably get deleted so those of you who think for yourselves take notice. </p>

<p>Trump on his relationship with Jeffrey epstein. Known pedophile.</p>

<p>So why does qAnon love trump so much if they are so concerned about pedophiles..
Again they only care when it applies to democrats..
I&#39;m not making it about politics either before you say that.. I&#39;m defining the hypocrisy there and pointing out that with qAnon it is ONLY about politics. If it was about purely  destroying pedophiles and their enablers they wouldn&#39;t have chosen trump as their God. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again you either don&#39;t read or choose to ignore things I said to substantiate your  argument.
I clearly made suggestions on ways to try to stop pedophiles. I listed some sites and an organization..
That if anyone wants to actually save children they would dedicate their time to working with these organizations instead of spending all their energy researching, waiting and  living their lives around some false prophecies..
That BTW have pretty much been proven to just be a cash grab.. It&#39;s pretty well documented that 3 or 4 people have benefited financially from qAnon and also were caught slipping manufacturing qAnon content..
And I think most with a shred of intelligence moved away from it.
On top of it all these people are being told that the truth is a lie.. And they are spreading lies that they believe are the truth and it&#39;s extremely cancerous and dangerous because reality is being lost... And eventually its going to lead to people getting hurt.
That&#39;s what happens with cults..
And it is a cult.. It has all the characteristics.. Yet people are so brainwashed they can&#39;t see it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually there have been enough Q comments that certain Reps. political figureheads are forced out because they were exposed internally or who are controlled (now). We can all guess what kind of blackmail was involved there.</p>

<p>Just watching that Lindsey Graham spectacle the last few weeks showed a guy they had by the balls and who was on a tight leach to act a certain way. Then his &quot;emotional&quot; performance at the Kavanaugh/Ford &quot;event&quot; deserved an oscar. It was delivered with a certain theatrical vibe.</p>

<p>I share your frustration, but they have proven their worth, even if it is politically motivated IMO.  They dug when no one else would, where no one else would.  That’s significant, even if limited in scope.  I just don’t want that shit drowning out everything else conspiracy related.</p>

<p>It’s going to take losing money, losing jobs, or some kind of significant lifestyle change before the ego gets the hard check it needs and they are even in a mental place to consider that.

<p>There are many organizations you can help with and put troll skills to use against pedophiles.</p>

<p>Now these maybe not the elite brand of pedophiles but these are things more geared towards protecting the children in your own neighborhoods.</p>

<p>Its not difficult at all to use Google to find ways to take action.</p>

<p>Yes hacking skills did help me see some people higher up the food chain get sent to prison over the years but there is other things you can do</p>

<p>There used to be a website specifically aimed at targeting corporations who took on pedophiles as clients but I don&#39;t  know if it&#39;s still around but... If it&#39;s not start one..</p>

<p>Also if you can&#39;t hack yourself.. Try going on irc servers and hanging around for awhile and learning some things.. Or convincing others that do have a skill set to help you track down some pedos and make their lives miserable.
Making their lives miserable was always the fun part to me. </p>

You made it political. Here I&#39;ll do an eli5 of our Convo so maybe you get it.</p>

<p>You commented and said op didn&#39;t post anything implicating Republicans..</p>

<p>I told you it wasn&#39;t about politics that people that make the issue of sexual abuse a left right thing disgust me..
But since you acted like there wasn&#39;t a republican that could be named I gave you a list..
Then you tell me to post a list of democrats....</p>

<p>And somehow still find a way to say I&#39;m the one making it political.</p>

<p>Lmao.</p>

<p>For
Fucks
Sake</p>

<p>Not sure If troll or
Not sure if russbot or..
Not sure if qAnon or..
Same shit different assholes just like dems and reps</p>

<p>One more time I am registered INDEPENDENT. I went out of my way to make sure I was not affiliated with either of those scum bag organizations..</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m even wasting my time explaining any of this to you because you will still try to argue and ignore all this shit I typed </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to incriminate myself any further than I already have. Also I&#39;m not going to spend time farming fresh information to win an argument with you. While it may seem that I&#39;m insulting people for believing the qAnon bs.. I&#39;m actually worried and concerned with how deeply people are being distanced from the actual truth.</p>

<p>If I didn&#39;t care about people I wouldn&#39;t have chose to apply myself to the causes I have.. Also I have never once referred to myself as elite.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be the first to admit there are a many many many people more talented than I.. I am still working on my info sec degree.. But what skills I do have I choose to use for a righteous purpose </p>
