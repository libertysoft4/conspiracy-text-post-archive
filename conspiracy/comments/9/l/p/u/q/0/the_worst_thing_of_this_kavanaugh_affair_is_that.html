Finding skeletons in this guys closet was the only hope we had of not allowing someone like this in one of the most powerful and influential positions we can offer a non-elected person.  Vice versa if there was a democrat majority senate and they had a guy like Kav they&#39;d vote yes for him too.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The case against Bart O&#39;s confirmation was quite strong before the attempted rape allegations came out, but it didn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>Despite his years as an operative and his role in the Ken Starr investigation, in the 2000 election vote count stoppage, in the GWB administration with respect to torture, illegal spying, using hacked emails to cheat on judicial nominations, secret legal analysis, etc., he was still going to be confirmed.</p>

<p>The allegations of alleged rape are very credible. They turned a few heads that would not have been if it had not come out.</p>

<p>The Bart O&#39; letter essentially admitting that he was the leader of the bad crowd really clinched it too. The school had a reputation of being drunkey and rapey. Bart and his friends were the reason. </p>

Some of this is clear cut for me, some are totally grey areas.  I feel that there are a lot of people who feel similar to how I do and it doesn’t matter if they are red or blue.

    <div class="md"><p>It is torture. Most of the patriot act is more about control of citizens and little to do with foreign terrorists so I disagree. It’s unnecessary and gives too much power to the federal government specifically the executive branch. It should be repealed. </p>

<p>As for tracking and selling your info it should be up to each individual not the corporation. Again we give too much power to corporations that are not out for anyone’s best interests. Terms and conditions with arbitration clauses should be outlawed. Removing due process is inherently wrong. </p>

<p>You can support spying/torture for national interests but I feel that most wars are started for the wrong reason specifically just to protect corporate interests and it is the people pay the price. That’s wrong. </p>

<p>Well duh?  There was a pattern of jealousy and accusations from previous girlfriends he had.  Holding politic views does not also endow someone with morals and character let alone make them immune to being a hypocrite.</p>

<p>I wish I understood why right wingers were so sensitive to the merest suggestion that one of your tribe might be an asshole.  I have no problem with the idea that a liberal might assault his wife because I don&#39;t live under the delusion that everyone who shares my views is also a good person.</p>

<p>The point of my post wasn&#39;t Republicans are bad, but rather that there&#39;s a convenience to certain points of view that can get challenged or changed by life experience.  It&#39;s easy to think you know what&#39;s right when you&#39;re not the one being impacted.</p>

<p>Some people still labor under the delusion that Trump was going to do anything other than kowtow to his base.  His swampiness became pretty clear early on and only gets worse.</p>

<p>Yet people still jerk off to Q fantasies that Trump is actually going to change things.  Yeah I&#39;m sure he only brought in neocons like Bolton to throw the deep state off the trail....</p>

<p>Q is a CIA or MI pied piper psy op. It&#39;s obvious at this point. I will not entertain discussion from Q cultists trying to convince me to see the light.</p>

<p>I have followed &quot;Q posts&quot; from the beginning. At some points I hoped it was real, but it became clear around February that it was just an IC pied piper psy op.</p>

<p>I feel sorry for the suckers who are still falling for that spook scam.</p>

<p>lol ok. The date keeps moving back every time it doesn&#39;t happen. It&#39;s exactly like how rapture cults used to work in the 1860s. I wouldn&#39;t invest so much energy in to this Q cult shit if I were you but at the same time I don&#39;t like telling people what to do or how to spend their time. It would be awesome if Q is legit of course, but it all sounds too good to be true, which means it is imo.</p>

<p>I have a lot of reasons and evidence for believing it. Keep following the doomsday cult if it makes you happy. Just be aware it&#39;s a government psy op.</p>

<p>I assume if you are deep enough in the cult you will simply dismiss my words and continue to listen and believe Q the savior of our republic who posts on 8chan. It&#39;s your duty to inform the normies when the &quot;military tribunals&quot; begin lol</p>

Obama campaigned against this stuff his first election so that argument would have loads of support from the left side of the aisle.

    <div class="md"><p>I like his explanation of the Patriot Act but he said very little about Kavanagh. Does anyone have a decent explanation of how Kavanaugh was involved? I&#39;ve seen in this comment section he was a lawyer hired to help iron out the details. Is that what you call the &quot;architect&quot;? I don&#39;t think so. That&#39;s a young lawyer doing the job he was hired for. This is petty. </p>

<p>Now that we all agree he&#39;s not part of a gang rapist clan, the narrative gets shifted to this? Weak.</p>

The documents Corey Booker had been releasing were showing that BK was being willfully deceptive in his answers about his involvement in a multitude of neo-con programs. The GOP wanted the narrative changed to the sexual assault (which they obviously knew about based on the 65 woman affidavit they had prepared). Seems this new narrative whipped up the incels from their base (aka T_D) and here we are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Driven by ambition the way its used here suggests you&#39;re willing to do almost anything to succeed (ie a sociopath). If that means screwing over innocents, so be it, if that means outfoxing more deserving, capable individuals, so be it. So pbviously it lends itself to immoral acts, but it also can lead to situations where the best guy for the job is not chosen, but rather the best marketer/schemer. Ex: athletes who cheat via steroids.</p>

<p>Crazy example: suppose I&#39;m a job candidate. I&#39;ve got 2 competitors. Both are better qualified. But me being more ambitious, I find out their addresses and sabotage their cars, so they are late for their interviews. I get the job thanks to this. I go on to be a less effective employee, but continue succeeding by sabotaging others, lying, etc. </p>

<p>Ambition is one thing, but along the top guys ambition can br downrght evil. Please don&#39;t help perpetuate a system of do anything to succeed.</p>

<p>This manipulation and distraction caused the conspiracy minded side to focus on the lies of Ford versus the background and voting record of Kavanaugh.  </p>

<p>The left could have kept this guy out if they had played upon the fears of this guys voting record.  The problem with that, is that they&#39;re complicit in the actions helped facilitate and cover up.  </p>

<p>Looking back, referring to Kavanaugh as an architect of the Patriot Act probably was a bit bombastic. However, this do not  change the fact that he played a critical role in its creation and continues to hold strong anti-privacy beliefs. </p>
