I filmed the orb in infrared with an iPhone pointed at the monitor, I had no recording device hooked up to the system at the time. I work on multiple FLIR systems for a living, repairing and maintaining them. Many models, a few different manufacturers. I have never seen anything stay motionless in the sky for 10-15 minutes, only to disappear. Plus, the fact that the day cams didn&#39;t pick it up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice FLIR camera, what kind is that (made by FLIR®)? And do you have it hooked up to a telescope? It really looks like the light is moving around at the beginning of the clip while you are zooming out.  </p>

<p>How do you know whatever the light is, is inside the atmosphere?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello,</p>

<p>Thanks! The one that was used with the UFO was not a FLIR Systems, Inc. (FSI) product. It&#39;s not hooked up to a telescope, these are government airborne systems that are normally mounted to aircraft. </p>

<p>The movement in the beginning is me centering the object in with the hand controller; the object is completely still. I did this to prove it wasn&#39;t a camera anomaly like a dead pixel group. </p>

<p>I assume it&#39;s inside the atmosphere due to it&#39;s size and strong heat signature. That&#39;s about all I had to base it on, being there was no point of reference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats what I would have like to seen also. Not being seen on the visible spectrum is something that the navy ufo encounter videos have shown us and we already know that. In one of the videos the pilots are talking about the object is causing a disturbance in the water, and both pilots were looking at the water being disturbed, but they couldnt see the object doing it. </p>

<p>I got a couple questions for op also, where did you get such a expensive piece of equipment, raytheon boasts that it was their ir cameras that caught first visual evidence of ufo&#39;s. But any equipment with the ability to track hot and cold objects and high speed cameras should be able to see them. </p>

<p>Hovering matches my own personal experiences, I seen what I thought was a planet one night, sit in one spot about 30 minutes, and then in the blink of a eye, it was gone, I would have thought it went behind a cloud except I saw it zoom across the horizon like a meteor and fade out of the atmosphere, surrounded by 30 other people drinking, and I was the only one who was looking up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they created us, either as workers or as a experiment. They had a war, one side won. The side that won only wanted to observe, they dont interfere. The bulk of them went home, leaving a small force behind, and every now and then they come back to rescue the cream of the crop from a planetary disaster, most likely caused by a brown dwarf companion star to sol. And when earth has calmed down they plop down the best humans they can to start the cycle again, I know im proably wrong, about most of it. </p>

<p>But honestly is it any crazier than the jews in jerusalem who believe that god is going to send down a gold palace to whisk the faithful and the deserving away to safety and let the rest of us burn. </p>

<p>But your right it could be anything, I recently came to a revelation, by looking at sumerian tablets about human creation, that these gods are about twice the size we are, so their ships are probably massive. And think about it, if you wanted to create a lesser race, making them 1/2 your size would make them that much easier to control.<br/>
Maybe they are making are leaders fatten us up and packing our planet chock full of tasty humans so they can come reap us every now and then. I think that was the plot of a bad sci fi movie. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like OP said, nice comment...</p>

<p>I think you are right, but I think the gold &quot;palace&quot; is more for docking than whisking people away, and that if you read carefully, the wording in Revelations is similar to that in Noah&#39;s story...the one&#39;s being &quot;taken&quot; aren&#39;t the good ones.  That is why the meek will inherit the Earth...to see the end result of a world that lives in harmony.   </p>

<p>And some food for thought...I saw a UFO when I was four and also think I saw another one when astrally projecting...and that was a GIGANTIC spacestation, slightly closer to Venus than to Earth.  If you&#39;ve seen the size of some stars out there, it&#39;s not hard to imagine there might be things on a very different scale than we are used to.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We initially saw it on an analog FLIR, and wanted a better view of it. We powered that down and pushed it out of the way, and set up a digital high-def FLIR. By the time it was cryogenically cooled- the orb was gone. It sat there before for 15 minutes, and disappeared in the exchange. We set up the original analog FLIR again, still nothing. 
Very disappointing! In retrospect, we could have done a much better job. But we just fix and test these systems, in my 12 years doing this it never came up except for that brief period of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the risk of being called out for attacking a redditor, I&#39;ve seen this video linked before. By you. Your post history is literally just this video, posted over and over to different subs, for the last 2 months. Why?</p>

<p>1) Self promotion? - can&#39;t be promoting your youtube channel. There is barely anything on it.</p>

<p>2) Are you involved in disinfo? - Seems likely considering the focus on posting this video over and over.</p>

<p>3) You think it is actually extremely important for people to see it - but why? You don&#39;t have any followup and not providing any extra information. So why keep reposting it without extra context or more of your discoveries? Maybe you don&#39;t have any, maybe for a reason.</p>

<p>I see you replying to things, and ~month ago you replied to me, so I am fairly sure you&#39;re not a bot, or at least not a cheap one.</p>

<p>What&#39;s up man? Why no followup filming with this defense contractor stuff you have access to  that you always talk about? Why no other content on your reddit account? Why are you new and mono-posting incessantly? Do you partake of other subreddits as a lurker? Which ones? What else do you do on reddit besides repost your video over and over?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They start getting expensive when it comes to magnification. The FLIR ONE is a cool starter FLIR. You should still be able to see objects in the sky, but the resolution would be poor and no magnification. You might want to google FLIR (FLIR Systems Inc.) and see what they have to offer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello,</p>

<p>Thanks! The one that was used with the UFO was not a FLIR Systems, Inc. (FSI) product. It&#39;s not hooked up to a telescope, these are government airborne systems that are normally mounted to aircraft. </p>

<p>The movement in the beginning is me centering the object in with the hand controller; the object is completely still. I did this to prove it wasn&#39;t a camera anomaly like a dead pixel group. </p>

<p>I assume it&#39;s inside the atmosphere due to it&#39;s size and strong heat signature. That&#39;s about all I had to base it on, being there was no point of reference.</p>
