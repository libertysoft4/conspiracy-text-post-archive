<p>They can try to keep pushing the pro-vaccine message, but eventually the fence-sitters will get sick of it and start researching for themselves </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Show me this ‘VAERS database’ please, how is it that I’ve been vaccinated my whole life and turned out perfectly fine. How is it that world leaders, business leaders and generally all rich people get themselves and their children vaccinated? Why is it only unhinged soccer mum’s and general uneducated people that are suddenly ‘woke’ to the dangers of vaccines. Lastly how come diseases that people are vaccinated against suddenly are coming back in waves because of idiots of vaccinating their children and general anti-vax sentiment. Thanks </p>

<p>You assume you are fine, but the brain damage is evident </p>

<p>Trump is on record calling the flu shot the biggest medical scam in history</p>

<p>Actually, the more educated a person is, the less likely thy are to vaccinate. </p>

<p>I can illustrate how uneducated you are about vaccines merely by asking you the purpose of an adjuvant </p>

<p>Correlation doesn&#39;t equal causation</p>

<p>In other words, there is absolutely no credible evidence that vaccines have ever eradicated a single disease</p>

<p>There is no credible evidence that vaccines have eradicated rinderpest, smallpox, or polio </p>

<p>Furthermore, there is no evidence any vaccine you ever received worked as intended for you</p>

<p>Vaccines truly are &quot;faith based medicine&quot;, which is why we call you &quot;vaccine cult victims&quot;</p>

<p>Bear in mind, if you claim you didn&#39;t get a certain disease, I&#39;ll point out the obvious fact that lots of people who didn&#39;t get that vaccine also didn&#39;t get the disease</p>

<p>You should probably research &quot;vaccine adverse event reporting system&quot; before injecting your children with risky vaccines</p>

Of the 2-year-old children born in the year when the Immunization Law-based vaccination against chickenpox was introduced, <strong>a mere 52 percent had received two shots</strong> — far below the 95 percent rate required for ensuring mass immunity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I&#39;m aware, in Canada no schools <strong>require</strong> vaccines, they may ask for medical history of vaccines, but many parents here have actually refused to sign it and have won in court cases where they did not have to sign this document to prove their child&#39;s vaccine history or get their child vaccinated.  </p>

<p>The U.S has 3 states which require vaccination being California, West-Virginia and Mississippi.  Although on the case of Mississippi they recently changed the law which required children to be vaccinated for preschool to change from &quot;required&quot; to &quot;recommended&quot; and they removed several dozen of the &quot;recommendations&quot;.  </p>

<p>By far almost nowhere actually requires vaccines to be admitted into the public school system, anywhere that does is just likely being dishonest or straight up lying in most cases like here in Canada where they were attempting to enforce it.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t really comment on your situation but &quot;proof of vaccination&quot; is just a document of whether you were vaccinated or exempted, it is not a document stating you must be vaccinated to attend, simply that it wants proof that you doctor has given you 1 of those 2 options, so if you&#39;re unvaccinated and have the exemption form, thats still proof of vaccination.  </p>
