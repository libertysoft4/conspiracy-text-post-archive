        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Can we agree, subject like the Kavanaugh/Ford case are usually just divisive events the media chooses to cover, to generate good ratings as well as create political division and social tension?</p>

<p>Why would a sub like r/conspiracy give a shit about this? I can&#39;t think of anything more inconsequential than this goofy little political TV soap opera.</p>

<p>But, as always, those who influence (often paid to influence) the climate of discussion forums like this one, benefit from forcing these and other meaningless mainstream topics onto the front page, often in a series of 5-7 reposts of the same article. </p>

<p>I could give two shits what the &quot;implications&quot; of this story are. What party or side &quot;wins&quot;, what will happen to Kavanaugh&#39;s political career as a result, none of it. The only reason this has been covered to such an extent, is to polarize the US population with another instance of sexual abuse, men vs women, left vs right in the political realm. </p>

<p>Talking about it only breathes life into it and distracts us all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is very true. However, the narrative of “woman accusing another man of rape”, plastered all over the media for the past month, and the verdict that followed, is going to have a massive divisive social impact on the population.</p>

<p>Knowing the degree to which the establishment and their pawns have infiltrated the positions of political power, I can’t help but see this as a mere distraction and a meaningless spectacle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly think this time around the conspiracy is happening right in front of out eyes. </p>

<p>This vote is really important to so many people especially women and the LGBT community. Trump and his posse have made it clear that over turning Roe v Wade is on their agenda and they know Kav is the guy to help them do it. You’ve got sen. graham saying he doesnt care what happens with the FBI his mind is made up, you’ve got people at marches saying its worth having a sexual assaultist (not a word, i know) on the supreme court as long as it stops abortion. Essentially people are saying someones character doesnt matter and they’ll do whatever it takes to get what that want. And the public has become so tribal that they’ve stopped questioning the people in charge and just want to destroy the other team, no matter what. </p>

<p>You’re misinformed. Kav had no interest in overturning roe, nor has this ever been on the Trump agenda. Trump is <strong>not</strong> anti abortion or pro abortion, he’s anti abortion <em>funding</em> which isn’t protected in roe anyway! The left media trotted this out when trump got his second pick to see division and fear, completely unsupported by any substantive reason. </p>

<p>Kav wasn’t the most conservative pick on his short list, he’d have appointed Amy if he’d truly wanted to overturn Roe. Kav <em>defended</em> Obamacare, and has a more moderate record than Gorsuch. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not a mainstream opinion, meanwhile senators and reporters have been saying, even if innocent, this stain on his reputation should keep him from SCOTUS. Even if <em>innocent</em>. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You talk strictly about abortion here, much less of a concern to the LGBT community than you realize I guess. Quit your fear mongering and get informed.</p>

<p>So any allegation is now an automatic judge of character. So if I call you a shill will no evidence then your character is permanent tared. Is that what you are saying?</p>

<p>As far as perjury, a devils triangle is not a “quarters game”. He lied.</p>

<p>For all we no he could have made up a game and called it that. We have no idea. Is innocent until proven guilty that hard to understand for you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d be surprised if this political theatre isn&#39;t rehearsed and planned beforehand, and already agreed to by contesting parties.</p>

<p>The narratives always coincidentally lead to effective division channels, and end up saturating multiple layers of public discourse. They also appear to reprogram blunted and impressionable minds with predictable talking points and delusions of grandeur. </p>

<p>More controversial I know; ...Americans have been doing marvellously with self-critique over recent years, but this type of culture which can be attributed as uniquely American, which disproportionately elevates political theatre, needs to be addressed.</p>

<p>No other country has such a brainwashed Hollywoodised psychology which experiences such futile division so vividly, and then strives to export it everywhere else.. </p>
