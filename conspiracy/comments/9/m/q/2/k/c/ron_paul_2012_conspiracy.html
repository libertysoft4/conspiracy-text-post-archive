        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I am just learning the conspiracy theory that Ron Paul was screwed out of the 2012 GOP primary basically the same way Bernie Sanders was in 2016.</p>

<p>I first heard about this yesterday and I want to learn more. I really like Ron Paul and support a lot of his ideas about the government. I never even knew about this until yesterday when I heard someone mention it in a YouTube video.</p>

<p>I did a search on google and read some articles but none of the articles came from any reputable sources. Basically it is just some random person writing an article with really no evidence.</p>

<p>With all the lies and fake stories online it is hard to know what to believe.</p>

<p>Can anyone help me out in understanding this more? Anyone want to discuss this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was my awakening. He was ignored by the Republican Party, and he was ignored by the media. </p>

<p>He had a different strategy of securing delegates instead of traditional primary campaigning that we normally see. GOP blocked his delegates and removed them from the convention. </p>

<p>When Paul made waves the media wouldn’t even mention his name. Paul took 2nd in Iowa? The pundits would talk about 1st, 3rd, 4th place and then talk up some schmo like Santorum who came in like 7th place as a “dark horse”. It was blatant, it was subversive. </p>

<p>I will never forgive the GOP establishment and the media. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or Republicans planned it all along. They actually used their outspoken words of opposition to make Donald Trump appear to be the &quot;outsider,&quot; and they made sure he would win the primaries by overloading it with too many candidates. Then, the most infamous neocons made it clear how much they hated Donald Trump and some even endorsed Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>Here in r/conspiracy, we should be able to recognize a grade-school level LARP -- especially when Republicans did it just a few years earlier with the Tea Party that went all Establishment after the 2010 election.</p>

<p>Now Donald Trump has done the same thing. He supports exactly the Republican agenda -- the very same agenda going all the way back to Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover.</p>

<p>Since the election, this has become crystal clear. Republicans are still pretending they hate Donald Trump while supporting nearly everything he does. This could not be clearer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An engaged populace is the requirement of a self governing people. In the modern age of mass media it seems we have advocated that responsibility foolishly thinking the press will let us know when we need to act as opposed to being involved in the first place and  in a functional position to take action. </p>

<p>The system was designed with this involvement implied, self governance takes action and oversight by the governed. The idea that protest is the extent of influence the citizenry can responsibly execute (reactionary)  has been played up over the last 55 years with the combined effect of a media heavy perspective leading to an apathetic and overwhelmed people.  If your worldview comes from a box, don&#39;t be surprised if feel boxed in by the limited and curated perspective it cultivates. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Typically if you secure enough primary votes then you “win” the vote of a number of that state’s delegates. However, there is no legal obligation for those delegates to vote for YOU just because you won the primary vote.

    <div class="md"><p>See that’s why I don’t know what to believe about this. The data shows Paul had no chance of winning. So conveniently the conspiracy theory says that the media was apart of the cover up.</p>

<p>So in order for this to be true the media had to be colluding with the GOP.</p>

<p>On top of that independent pollsters have to be in on it as well. Some of these polls come from colleges.</p>

<p>I just have a hard time believing this, especially seeing the left wing media help  the GOP.</p>

<p>Now do I think some polls are fake or inaccurate? Sure but for all of the polls and people/organizations from the left and the right to come together on this is kinda hard to believe.</p>

<p>Now I can believe that there may have been some corrupt things going behind the scenes. Maybe a State was stolen, some delegates but all states with completely different people with different beliefs, connections and goals to all come together and support Romney who wasn’t a popular guy and really didn’t have the conservative values to get loyal people behind him is really unlikely.</p>

<p>So yeah probably so shady deals happened behind the scenes and maybe some delegates sold out is more likely what happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When someone is doing somewhat well, they benefit significantly from the media covering it. That can be what gives their campaign the extra boost to go from 3rd or 4th place to 1st. The media refusing to discuss his rising standings and instead pretending he doesnt exist deprived him of the popularity he deserved, and so many people missed out on the opportunity to learn what he was about and give him their consideration.  It is fairly similar to what happened with Sanders.</p>

Then he got 2nd in New Hampshire for the 2nd state and media didnt care.  They kept telling everyone &quot;he&#39;s unelectable he wont win&quot; - well yeah win you tell the American zombies that enough they start believing it...and sure enough I got in countless arguments on social media with people regurgitating that &quot;hes unelectable!

<p>I take everything him and his group says with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>I know when the daily show does interviews they cut out and manipulate what the guest says.</p>

<p>What’s sad is there are a lot of people who take him and his ilk believe what they say as fact.</p>

<p>So many people in late night tv started from Stewart’s show and they all twist the truth to fit their narrative that is always what narrative the left is promoting.</p>

<p>John Oliver, Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee and Trevor Noah are part of this cabal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know the democrat primary is different than the GOP, mainly because of super delegates but still it comes down to the power of the delegates.</p>

<p>I believe you are correct, the GOP would rather loose to the democrats than have certain candidates win.</p>

<p>We have seen this most recently with Roy Moore. The establishment GOP wouldn’t support him at all. Mitch McConnell and Co. did everything they could to make sure he didn’t win.</p>

<p>There is even rumors that the sexual harassment accusations came from GOP opposition research that was given to the media/ democrats.</p>

<p>Moore barely lost by a few thousand. Maybe if Mitch and the establishment GOP just provided a little bit of help then Moore could have won.</p>

<p>Btw I don’t believe Moore was guilty. After you sort out the fake news against him ( like him being banned from a mall because he was sexually harassing someone) you can easily debunk the claims against him.</p>

<p>Notice after the election the accusers were quiet and the media could care less about them? Meanwhile Moore pressed charges against him.</p>

<p>Sexual harassment claims will happen every close election now. You can’t prove they happened or didn’t happen and it comes down to he said she said. That’s why they are so effective and will be used. Eventually it will happen so much no one will care but by then how many elections will have been decided by a unproven allegation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we need to create laws where you cannot falsely accuse anyone of sexual harassment and if you do you face a felony.</p>

<p>Also I think that any media, congressmen or political group who creates false allegations like that should face criminal charges.</p>

<p>Notice how all the accusers against Kavanaugh never once accused him of rape? That’s because a false rape accusation is a big crime. However just saying you were groped or heard or saw someone sexually Harassing someone is basically slander, misdemeanor or a lawsuit.</p>

<p>And if these people get sued don’t think for one second that they will ever have to pay anything. The political party backing them will pay for it.</p>

<p>Kavanaugh is now publicly known as a rapist by many people even though he has never been charged or even had evidence or witnesses say he raped anyone.</p>

<p>I know some people will say well how come they don’t sue? Well let’s say he does sue. That cost money. Lawyers aren’t cheap and if you sue you probably won’t make a lot of money if you win. So really you are going to spend a lot of money for nothing.  The damage was already done and most people won’t know you won in court and will still think you are guilty.</p>

<p>You could sue the media for making up lies. It cost money as well. You will spend thousands of dollars and all you get is the media to redact the story at best or just change a few words or a sentence.  </p>

<p>The story with the lie in it has already been released once again damage done. The media outlet won’t go out and make some big announcement saying hey we made this small mistake.</p>

<p>Sure sometimes you get some rare occurrences where the media publishes something wrong and they say hey we messed up but that’s usually only after the public notices and starts calling out the media outlet hurting its credibility.</p>

<p>I am for freedom of speech. I am for a free press and believe it is important especially when it comes to criticizing the government. I do think that there must be some accountability for false statements and lies, especially when they can ruin lives or cause harm to someone. </p>

<p>CNN for example ran with the famous hands up don’t shoot narrative of Ferguson. It was all a lie. It never happened. But because of the media wanting ratings and money over truth they didn’t do much research into the issue and cause a massive riot in Ferguson. How many people were hurt because of this? How much of  people’s property was damaged? How much time and money wasted? How many people went to jail because of this?</p>

<p>All because of a lie.</p>

<p>I believe CNN and all media outlets who promoted that narrative should have to pay for all the damage done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There should be substantial repercussions for making false claims of sexual assault. A man&#39;s (or woman&#39;s) life can be ruined with that one lie. How many claims crop up from &quot;morning after&quot; regrets or revenge for &quot;pump and dump.&quot; Since there is little in the way of repercussions (what is it, a misdemeanor to make false statements? And who&#39;s going to &#39;victim shame?&#39; Meanwhile the accused has that black cloud hanging over them for life), there&#39;s no deterrent for immoral, entitled individuals.

    <div class="md"><p>Big difference was Ron Paul did not go on to endorse or campaign for the primary winners in &#39;08 or &#39;12. Sanders did roll over and go out hard for Clinton, leaving his supporters and delegates hanging at the DNC. Sanders got next to nothing added to the DNC Platform, yet still went out for Clinton. </p>

<p>Both parties made the same huge mistake. Instead of bringing in the most energetic new comers to the party, they purposely excluded them, and both had the same results. Imagine if Ron Paul was the VP in &#39;08 or &#39;12? Or Sanders in &#39;16? A different dynamic would have been seen. </p>

<p>I supported Paul both times, and in the general, I wrote in Paul instead of supporting either of the two major party candidates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think so. I know Jeb Bush has a lot of money invested into the primary and had the backing of Karl Rove and his political machine and still lost “BIGLY”. I remember hearing Karl Rove say that the Bush campaign and PACs invested like $40 million in the New Hampshire race which was equal to a few bucks per person in the state.</p>

<p>from what I read in the “Making of the President” book by Roger Stone that Trump didn’t have the right guys to get the delegates. Trump didn’t think he was going to win so he didn’t hire the staff that was needed. Once he found out he had a chance he brought in Paul Manafort because he had experience in the primaries and how to handle the delegate process.</p>

<p>The rest is history.  That’s one reason why Paul Manafort only lasted about 2 months with the campaign. He was only brought in for one purpose and once that was done he didn’t need them.</p>

<p>I honestly can’t believe that the media really believes that Manafort knows all of Trumps secrets. Anyone who does a little research knows that Manafort not only wasn’t in the campaign long but there never was a reason for Trump to trust him enough to give him any incriminating evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started following him during the &#39;08 election. I noticed that Fox News was actively trying to make him seem crooked and racist by taking small edits of him saying outlandish things with audio of crowds booing him. They were even taking the video of him and tinting the hue to make him look yellow sickly (kinda like how today&#39;s networks make Trump look oranger than reality). There was a ton of interest in him. One day I was waiting in line at a restaurant behind a group of elderly people talking about how much they like Ron Paul&#39;s policies, but then one of them interjected, &quot;yeah, I think he&#39;s great, but he just doesn&#39;t have a chance.&quot; The TV was telling us that much and back in those days TV was a powerful brainwashing force, but it&#39;s not as powerful anymore. Big tech is the new brainwashing threat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Ron Paul situation was my redpill. Ron Paul was by far the most popular candidate and the way they shut it down was one of the most disheartening things I have ever experienced. </p>

<p>I actually made a post in <a href="/r/SandersForPresident">/r/SandersForPresident</a> warning them about what would happen about a year before the election and got 5 up votes lol. You couldn&#39;t even help these people if you wanted to. They are so fucking stupid, honestly they got what they deserve with this current administration. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. He was the last politician I really got behind. I even went to a rally when he visited my town and my (now)wife got her phone case signed by him. It seemed like everyone was pumped about him.</p>

<p>Then I noticed that I had to really dig to find his content. He wasn&#39;t getting the air time that other candidates were, even though he was ahead of them. Add to that the snide comments from newsheads and the blatant whitewashing of his message and material. It was infuriating.</p>

<p>That&#39;s when I realized that this problem won&#39;t be solved by voting. Because we will never be given the chance to vote for someone who wants to change things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only in 2012, but 2008 as well. They weren&#39;t quite as prepared in 2008 so the GOP were just flailing in a panic.  In my state, caucuses were shut down and disregarded when Ron Paul supporters showed up and secured delegate spots. Ron Paul supporting delegates were rooted out and disenfranchised by any means possible (I remember one person being stripped of their delegate position because they had attended a Libertarian rally of some kind, for instance). At the state convention they put language into the rules that would allow them to railroad the party platform through without allowing for proposed amendments, because there was a strong showing (nowhere near a majority, maybe a quarter, or so) of Ron Paul supporters who wanted to interject. It was a mess. </p>

<p>By 2012 the machine was in place to prevent Ron Paul supporters from really being able to get much traction. There was a ton more support for RP, but the establishment was in their element and it was pretty clear that it wasn&#39;t going to be able to make much of a dent. If only the numbers had been there a few years earlier... </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been talking to people about this ever since I saw the strikingly similar narrative play out in the Bernie/Hilary race. It reminded me of what I learned back in those 2008 &amp; 12 elections, and it really drove home for me just how true it is that there is no substantive difference between the D&#39;s &amp; the R&#39;s. They&#39;re just two sides of the same worthless, poisonous coin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was involved then.  </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The news cycle was fake. The polls were fake. The media was fake. The Romney v. Obama discourse was choreographed. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Ron Paul was the real winner in Iowa, but the local GOP tried covering that up by initially making Romney the winner, until they were forced to resign, and &quot;a recount&quot; was conducted. Then, the announced winner was Santorum, because the Grand Old Politburo powers that be decided they would rather risk defeat and alienation at the polls in November, than have someone outside their control on a mainstream debate stage with President Obama, or in The Oval Office. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>It was Ron who won the most delegates from Iowa by the time of the Tampa Convention. Their purge of the Paul supporters further sealed their doom in November. Only Ron stood a reasonable chance at having a broad enough, multi-partisan appeal as a fundamentally anti-war, pro-civil liberties candidate. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The newsletters were problematic, and worthy of more serious scrutiny by those of us who were involved in the days of the &#39;12 campaign. But, their content was not reflective of the overwhelming vast majority of the liberty movement. While, unfortunately, some of the Ron crowd did go alt-right, and some were always alt-right, what those of us who weren&#39;t about that were trying to do as committed libertarians then was use the GOP as a vehicle to advance human freedom; by &quot;throwing all the bums out&quot; in keeping with the early Tea Party movement&#39;s message that was by no means only reserved for establishment Democrats. That message was further bastardized beyond recognition by Republican oligarchical elitists much later. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>We wanted a better world. We wanted smaller government, and more freedoms for everyone; regardless of skin color, or country of origin. We were against ALL wars of imperialist aggression, no matter which country&#39;s military-industrial complex was ultimately responsible for starting one. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>It&#39;s concerning and unnerving to see so many former Paul supporters, and once self-described committed Constitutionalists, who have since sacrificed their beliefs in liberties for a false promise of security from a notorious liar, and an authoritarian tyrant who is every bit a component, along with his entire administration of criminals, of the very DC swamp he claims to be draining.... Maybe former Ron supporters might remember his speeches on the subject, and what the former congressman himself has had to say about the neo-theocon administration that has since succeeded Obama.    </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>There was about the Ron Paul revolution lot that was similar to the Bernie movement in the sense that, like libertarianism post-2012, it eclipsed the popular appeal of the two political parties self-described libertarians and democratic socialists have had only limited success running for office in. If the best of both currents could merge, and keep the extremism out of their movements, they would be a serious force to be reckoned with, and a real game changer. And, that&#39;s why neither party is willing to endorse real revolutionary messages, as they would undermine their continued monopoly on power, and all their trillions at stake.   </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>There are people still alive today who have been a part of these movements. There are antifa street marchers and white nationalists alike who were a part of the Ron Paul movement before they were literally doing battle with each other in American street turf wars. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>There were Occupy Wall Street Paul supporters as much as their were Bundy Rancher Ron Paul supporters.</p>

<p>It was a very broad political and social movement whose unifying message was, for the most part (with some exceptions), anti-establishmentarian. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>My best advice to anyone who was maybe too young to remember what was happening when this was happening is find someone who was involved then. Everyone who was there has a story to tell. For better and for worse, it is the future of America.  The R3VOLUTION continues, and it&#39;s not being televised. It&#39;s being livestreamed, and it&#39;s in the mainstream news cycle. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The GOP&#39;s attempted suppression of the Paul rebellion significantly weakened an element of the Republican establishment that, for all of its sins, was keeping a lid on SOME things, emboldened the rise of another arm of the political establishment, and fueled the rise of the libertarians and the neo-Nazi alt-right extremists who sometimes masquerade as libertarians in a similar sense to the way extremists in Syria sometimes masquerade as &quot;moderate rebels&quot; whenever they&#39;re trying to soften their image beyond the civil war zone that&#39;s now almost a decade old. In a number of respects, today&#39;s political battles in the U.S. significantly mirror the dynamics at play in Syria. And, if we&#39;re not careful, we might be headed down that road soon if we&#39;re not there already. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>We now have anti-fascists at war with literal fascists the president considers &quot;fine people,&quot; even though they&#39;re Nazis. And, the roots of both groups very much had their roots in and briefly intersected in the Ron Paul R3VOLUTION. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok i&#39;m gonna hit you with the horrible truth... you wont believe it at first but over time you will...</p>

<p>all the politicians are controlled... its just theater for the masses... bernie and ron etc are to give an illusion of choice to certain demographics.  they are always saying great things but in reality never DO anything great.   after all the theater ,the one they wanted gets in but he is only a spoksperson.  they have no real power...   they are just a figurehead for the people to love then hate till it all starts again.</p>

<p>don&#39;t waste any time on the shit show your life will be much better for it.</p>

<p>btw ron and bernie agree with the official story of 911 so that should be proof enough.  </p>

<p>the masses need to have an illusion of choice or we would fight back.</p>

<p>you are living in a people farm... the point of this farm is to farm the humans...  this is why the poor pay for the rich.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we need to create laws where you cannot falsely accuse anyone of sexual harassment and if you do you face a felony.</p>

<p>Also I think that any media, congressmen or political group who creates false allegations like that should face criminal charges.</p>

<p>Notice how all the accusers against Kavanaugh never once accused him of rape? That’s because a false rape accusation is a big crime. However just saying you were groped or heard or saw someone sexually Harassing someone is basically slander, misdemeanor or a lawsuit.</p>

<p>And if these people get sued don’t think for one second that they will ever have to pay anything. The political party backing them will pay for it.</p>

<p>Kavanaugh is now publicly known as a rapist by many people even though he has never been charged or even had evidence or witnesses say he raped anyone.</p>

<p>I know some people will say well how come they don’t sue? Well let’s say he does sue. That cost money. Lawyers aren’t cheap and if you sue you probably won’t make a lot of money if you win. So really you are going to spend a lot of money for nothing.  The damage was already done and most people won’t know you won in court and will still think you are guilty.</p>

<p>You could sue the media for making up lies. It cost money as well. You will spend thousands of dollars and all you get is the media to redact the story at best or just change a few words or a sentence.  </p>

<p>The story with the lie in it has already been released once again damage done. The media outlet won’t go out and make some big announcement saying hey we made this small mistake.</p>

<p>Sure sometimes you get some rare occurrences where the media publishes something wrong and they say hey we messed up but that’s usually only after the public notices and starts calling out the media outlet hurting its credibility.</p>

<p>I am for freedom of speech. I am for a free press and believe it is important especially when it comes to criticizing the government. I do think that there must be some accountability for false statements and lies, especially when they can ruin lives or cause harm to someone. </p>

<p>CNN for example ran with the famous hands up don’t shoot narrative of Ferguson. It was all a lie. It never happened. But because of the media wanting ratings and money over truth they didn’t do much research into the issue and cause a massive riot in Ferguson. How many people were hurt because of this? How much of  people’s property was damaged? How much time and money wasted? How many people went to jail because of this?</p>

<p>All because of a lie.</p>

<p>I believe CNN and all media outlets who promoted that narrative should have to pay for all the damage done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When someone is doing somewhat well, they benefit significantly from the media covering it. That can be what gives their campaign the extra boost to go from 3rd or 4th place to 1st. The media refusing to discuss his rising standings and instead pretending he doesnt exist deprived him of the popularity he deserved, and so many people missed out on the opportunity to learn what he was about and give him their consideration.  It is fairly similar to what happened with Sanders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There should be substantial repercussions for making false claims of sexual assault. A man&#39;s (or woman&#39;s) life can be ruined with that one lie. How many claims crop up from &quot;morning after&quot; regrets or revenge for &quot;pump and dump.&quot; Since there is little in the way of repercussions (what is it, a misdemeanor to make false statements? And who&#39;s going to &#39;victim shame?&#39; Meanwhile the accused has that black cloud hanging over them for life), there&#39;s no deterrent for immoral, entitled individuals.
