<p><a href="https://spotlightonabuse.wordpress.com/">https://spotlightonabuse.wordpress.com/</a></p>

<p>it&#39;s primarily links from the UK and you kinda have to arrrange the information yourself but there are links to the US, Belgium and elsewhere and if you immerse yourself in that site long enough...just absorbing it all then you will start to get a hint of an idea of what was really going down and why.</p>

<p>btw - ignore the Jonny Gosch thing...he wasnt involved...bonucci only said so to protect himself via the publicity around Jonnys case. I&#39;ve long beliveed that Danny Heinreich killed both Jonny Gosch and also Eugene Martin who also went missing from Des Moines around the same time.</p>

<p>there is a massive amount of disinformation around this subject tho...those involved know how to play the media game...the UK allegations have been dismissed by the general populace because of this. Google &#39;nick vip paedophile abuse&#39; - nick was always a patsy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read <a href="https://ia800206.us.archive.org/14/items/DavidMcGowanProgrammedToKill_201603/David-McGowan-Programmed-to-Kill.pdf">Programmed to Kill</a> by David McGowan.  From what I can tell, DeCamp was put there to misdirect people away from the Catholic pedophilia at Boys Town and toward Franklin.  To quote <em>Programmed to Kill</em>:</p>

<p><em>The  wreckage  of  Caradori’s  plane,  as  a  reporter  on  the  scene  noted,  was “strewn  over  a  ¾  to  1  mile  stretch.”  A  National  Transportation  Safety  Board investigator  acknowledged  that  the  “fact  that  the  wreckage  is  scattered  over  a  large area  certainly  demonstrates  that  it  did  break  up  in  flight.”  Family  members claimed  that  there  were  items  missing  from  the  plane’s  wreckage,  most  significantly  Caradori’s  briefcase.  Within  twenty-four  hours  of  the  crash,  all  of  his records  had  been  impounded  by  the  FBI.  Nevertheless,  the  NTSB  ruled  that  the crash  had  been  accidental,  with  no  evidence  of  sabotage.  The  Franklin Committee—led  by  Senator  Schmit,  who  suspected  sabotage—ordered  a  private investigation  into  the  cause  of  the  crash.  Strangely  enough,  the  man  selected  to conduct  that  inquiry  was  William  Colby,  a  fifty-year  veteran  of  intelligence  operations  whose  career  began  in  the  OSS  during  World  War  II.  Colby’s  hiring  was urged by his protégé, Senator DeCamp.</em></p>

<p>_In  the  1950s,  Colby  served  as  the  CIA  station  chief  in  Italy,  overseeing  the notorious  Operation  Gladio.  In  the  1960s,  he  ran  the  Phoenix  Program,  a  campaign  of  assassination,  torture  and  terror  that  claimed,  by  Colby’s  own  account, some  20,000 Vietnamese  lives.  The  program  was  steeped  in  mind  control  operations,  including  the  use  of  prisoners-of-war  as  unwilling  participants  in  terminal experiments.  One  of  Colby’s  top  aides  in  Vietnam  was  none  other  than  John DeCamp.  After  Vietnam,  Colby  served  as  the  director  of  the  CIA  under  President Nixon  (Nixon’s  appointed  successor,  Gerald  Ford,  replaced  him  with  George Bush).  Considering  his  past  history,  Colby  was  certainly  an  odd  choice  to  lead  an inquiry  aimed  at  ascertaining  the  truth.  Colby’s  conclusion,  according  to  the Omaha World  Herald,  was  that  although  “the  crash  had  some  strange  aspects, there was no specific evidence of sabotage.”</p>
