        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’m finally breaking my silence of 17 years as a 9/11 first responder to the Pentagon...I was stationed at Fort Myer VA during the attack’s and my unit was detailed in search and rescue...and then search and recovery...I will never go into the details of that day or afterwards and I will probably end up deleting this account because I do not like the attention from this...<br/>
I love reddit, and I love r/conspiracies and 10 months out of the year I can stomach every remark, angle, negative words of all those involved, who wasn’t involved and on and on...lol basically what we all look for in conspiracies and love about this community but idk can we stop or tone it down this time of year please. It’s so hard to go anywhere this time of year and not hear about it and then to come to the internet, to this community and see the same stuff over and over again and then the comments turn my stomach for a loop. Please don’t get me wrong, I will obsess over JFK Conspiracies, MK Ultra and all the cool ideas and conspiracies that you all have provided. I truly get all the obsessions over this one that we all are living in...No matter what the reasons where, the who, the why, generations are/will be effected by that day. We lost so many people that day and since countless countless more and no matter who is at fault those lives are gone...In our lifetime something greater than the great wars and for most of our existence on this planet has happened and there is nothing we can do to get those lives back...those loved ones who hurled themselves to their death from collapsing buildings, the father who never will go home, to the baby who will
never grow up to love, to cry, to read conspiracies on the internet, to the children who will never play in the streets of Baghdad, to my childhood friend Nate who was killed somewhere in Iraq or my Squad mate Fritsche killed somewhere in Afghanistan, or the countless bodies I had to bury at ANC.
I can go on and on but what I am asking for is just a little humanity this time of year for everything that has come out of that day...I have only lost my soul, my happiness, my marriage and my mind because of 9/11 and it fades in comparison to those who lost more, way more during and after and even current. I’m not asking for you to not stop talking about or to not ask every single question there is because we should never not stop asking and probing and prodding but September and October are the worst months of the year for me without all the hooplas.<br/>
Idk why after so long I have broken my
silence on the matter, maybe divorce and my brothers suicide coupled with PTSD has shook me to my core, maybe reading that thing about Russia’s tribute to us sparked something in me this morning or the comments I honestly do not know. 
I know at the end of the day people will do what they do and this will probably be  overlooked or downvoted  but if this gets through can we all just shut the fuck up for a little while about this maybe complain about Christmas music in October or something funny about moths but allow some god damn peace and respect. It’s bad enough I can’t sleep at 5:30 in the morning then to be reading r/conspiracies about Putin’s vagina or some other 9/11 nonsense makes it really tough. 
Idk, thanks ahead of time I guess and sorry for all spelling and grammar mistakes as I am on my cellphone and my hands are shaky and slippery from my tears :) Sorry admins that this isn’t a conspiracy and that it’s very long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OMG, “first responders” and “families of the victims” are coming on r/conspiracy you guys, they are parsing through every post, clicking on those regarding 911, reading through comments, finding your comment, reading it in full, and, and, and ... becoming offended!</p>

<p>How dare you write something that made these holy beings offended? Didn’t you know their feelings superseded the truth? What are you going to say, when they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceS_jkKjIgo">catch leperacy because of what you wrote?</a></p>

<p>That reminds me of these horrible people who ask questions about WW2! How dare they offend the ever-growing quantity of “holocaust survivors”?</p>

<p>On a serious note my friend, if you were really a “first responder”: your bosses/overlords blatantly lied to you (about how the buildings were destroyed and the radioactivity you were going to be exposed to). They knowingly and cynically <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/939qha/after_911_government_officials_tested_air_quality/e3caj58/">sacrificed your health</a> in order to have their little ritual.</p>

<p>That’s what we’re supposed to believe, but it isn’t so. Of course the idea of having a “shock and awe” mega-ritual is also meant to intimidate adversaries, to show off their “power”, and their ability to manipulate the masses with such in-your-face theatrics that you despair at humanity’s gullibility (I mean - come on - aluminum planes cutting through steel beams like a hot knife through butter and then proceeding to entirely pulverize a larger number of skyscrapers; people would laugh at the idea if they didn’t think they saw it happen).</p>

<p>But theirs is a game in diminishing returns. They paid a high price for 911, in the form of people waking up. Even though they try to channel that awakening (think Michael Moore or his right-wing equivalent Alex Jones, etc.), it is inevitable in the long term - and they know it.</p>

<p>If, every time you lie, you need to wrap that lie in a package of truth, well the more you lie, the quicker your interlocutor will understand the whole truth.</p>

<p>I mean... everyone knows there was no plane, I just want to make sure you are who you claim to be (i.e., &quot;a 9/11 first responder to the Pentagon&quot;) and not not shilly pro-war on terror bot.</p>

<p>What your theory for what his the curb and power generator? The impacts are consistent with where the engines on a 757 would have been.</p>

<p>you just answered your own question.</p>

<p>i like the photo of the building pre-collepse.</p>

<p>there are no holes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>where the wings should be;</p></li>
<li><p>where the engines would be;</p></li>
<li><p>there are no skid marks on the ground from where a 757 slide into home, so to speak, which means the 757 would have literally had to fly mere feet off the ground at 500 miles an hour... bwaahhhaa...  you are clearly not in the air force ;)</p></li>

<p>mate, i am sorry... you claim to be a first responder.  you were not.  you showed up days later.</p>

<p>The title of your post literally says &quot;As a 9/11 first responder&quot;</p>

<p>Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to spend any more time on this, but I had been looking for that photo - which clearly shows the the Pentagon&#39;s pre-collapse.  Clearly no way a 757 traveling 500+ MPH would have done so little damage.</p>

<p>Best of luck with your quest to convince the world of something that never happened.</p>

<p>Cheers.  </p>

<p>Steel does need to completely melt if the building fails at 98% free-fall -- which all 3 buildings did (fail at +98% freefall).</p>

<p>Pentagon Performance Report.</p>

<p>Steel can start to fail at 1100°F.</p>

<p>Only the external wall of WTC7 feel at freefall, and that was for only a small portion of the the collapse. WTC 1 and 2 fell significantly slower, as evidenced by the pieces of the building that were detached (and thus in true freefall) falling much faster than the collapse.</p>

<p>would NOT have resulted in TOTAL collapse -- not even if the entire building was submerged in jet fuel, and then set on fire.</p>

<p>regardless, the jet fuel only touched 5%  (at most) of the steel in WTC 1 &amp; 2.  (and no jet fuel at all in WTC7 -- the ONLY building that achieved 100% freefall for a period of time -- according to NIST)</p>

<p>The jet fuel didn&#39;t bring down the building. It was the ignition source, but it was all the flamible material in the tower that brought it down. The steel in the towers would have also been far more susceptible to heat because the fireproofing would have been knocked off in the impact.</p>

<p>&quot;Pull it&quot; is not a common term in the industry and is more likely to be about pulling firefighting efforts from the area.</p>

<p>Honestly, I&#39;m not sure what that video is saying. He never specifically mentions WTC7, but does seem to be talking about the new one since the details are right. I haven&#39;t been able to find the full video to see what the context of those statements are.</p>

<p>So, are you just going to ignore the hole that&#39;s the shape an size of a 757?</p>

<p>Nah, I think you&#39;re just super insecure.  Again, nothing to do with the &quot;evidence&quot; or &quot;valid points&quot; you push.  My views on what makes me think there was foreknowledge of 911 doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

You can&#39;t possibly be this dense...gee I fucking wonder why the official cover up stories of all the events discussed on a conspiracy forum don&#39;t show up as much as the conspiracy theories do....quit making excuses as to why you&#39;re here. As I said before, a lot of people here have read into the official stories and are still not satisfied.  Events happen and there is a lot (to say the least) of questions about evidence and investigation.  Mix that with a rightful distrust of the players involved and you have a CONSPIRACY <em>THEORY</em></p>

Said I have struggled with 17 years of this so talking about with friend and family and therapists is tough and tougher more so to complete strangers who will never experience what we waded  through during and after...To be as brief as possible I was a casket bearer for full honor burials at ANC my job was never to be a first responder so it wasn’t like my unit was waiting for an attack to respond to, so what I am saying is by the time my company was rostered to go down a lot had happened and no when I was there I didn’t see a plane in the physical building. I am not claiming to have been physically right there when it happened, I was inside getting ready for funerals that day on Ft. Myer. By the time we got there is was probably 9/13 but it was over 17 years ago and we had no sleep for about two days.
I have to ask since you asked me some questions...why does it matter if there was, what will you do about it?</p>
