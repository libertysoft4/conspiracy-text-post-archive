    <div class="md"><p>As someone who has been exposed to the radiation oncology industry for a long time, I wish this conspiracy was true. Unfortunately the best cure we currently have is chemotherapy, ~50% success rate is a modern scientific marvel that we&#39;re fortunate to have.</p>

<p>I know many patients who have opted for only CBD/cannabis treatments and those who supplemented their chemo with these holistic treatments. The addition of chemo is always better, I&#39;m speaking from tangible results. Ask any radiation oncologist if you should take CBD etc in addition to chemo and they will all say it can&#39;t hurt to try, but it alone won&#39;t be enough.</p>

<p>Steve jobs would still be alive of he&#39;d followed traditional treatment.</p>

<p>There&#39;s simply too many types of cancer for a single cure. Gene therapy is a promising solution being researched, in conjunction with chemo etc.</p>

<p>Please feel free to try CBD in conjunction with your treatments, don&#39;t rely on them alone. Suggesting people do this is very dangerous and will cost people their lives.</p>

<p>I get downvoted everytime I defend chemo. I really wish there was a simple solution or a grand conspiracy to hide the cure, but their isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Instead let&#39;s focus on the cause of increased cancer rates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly...</p>

<p>&quot;Complementary medicine did no apparent harm if people used it alongside conventional surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, the researchers found. But when people opted out of proven treatments to choose herbs, homeopathy or other alternative treatments, they were twice as likely to die of their cancer.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ehh yea I do. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>You have a pharma company which produces chemotherapeutics or the like. You also happen to sit with the cure in your archive. If you choose to monetize the cure you will have a practical monopoly for 14-21 years (as that is the duration of a pharma patent), you would be the only person to rake in money for those years and everyone else would make 0 dollars. You could also choose to not monetize and keep making money on your existing products, BUT you are at any given point in danger of one of your dozens of competitors to all of the sudden monetize the cure first, being the one making all the cash. Then you would make $0 for the next 14 years. In every situation you would absolutely monetize the cure ASAP, as you can&#39;t risk someone else doing it before you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It takes only about 3 years for other medical companies to find a work around for your patent.

<p>Ehh what? If you do a decent FTO in beforehand and set up defensive IP (as you bloody well should), then you can absolutely keep monopoly. If you could only keep patent for 3 years, then no one would ever do anything in pharma, so the claim that you can only have profits for 3 years is just blatantly false. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure that I&#39;ve already done quite some &quot;research&quot; on the topic. I had a meeting with my patent attorney just this monday on how to expand our current filing to better protect us. Mind you that we are even working with analogs of naturally occuring hormones, that are already used in other drugs, and we still managed to make a pretty sturdy fence. But it&#39;s probably easier for me to give you examples of how long they last, take PTH analog for post-menopausal osteoporosis, which is currently held by Elli Lilly&#39;s Forteo: </p>

<p>Every company would take the 100 billion dollars now, because you can&#39;t guarantee that the 50 billion would keep on coming.

<p>No, actually conglomorates are illegal. Also, it wouldn&#39;t work because there are THOUSANDS of biotech companies. Even if Pfizer and Roche had a deal, a biotech company could easily just go out and file a patent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Curing cancer is bad for business. Think of all the research funding and hospital programs for cancer research. You cure cancer, no need for any of that money to come pouring in. </p>

<p>Why cure a disease when you can make money treating it. </p>

<p>Nobody in the civilian population knows what causes it, so it keeps people scared of it and booking doctors apts too. </p>

<p>I guarantee that if a bilderburg family member or Bill Gates developed cancer, it would &quot;disappear&quot;.  If they were able to keep that Rockefeller alive for as long as they did with 5 heart transplants that proves that money can buy you anything. No way he made the transplant list that many times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>actually some the causes of many cancers are well-known and we could prevent a lot of these.</p>

<p>Carcinogenic environmental toxins. We get exposed to many cancer causing chemicals each day and not surprisingly many of us develop cancer. Instead of finding a miracle cure maybe we try to limit exposure to chemicals that cause the disease in the first place.</p>

<p>There is of course no money to be made, that&#39;s why we rarely discuss it.</p>
