    <div class="md"><p>You mean like UFOs abducting people are actually government ops to conduct illegal human experimentation? If so, I’d say no. Alien disguises would be unnecessarily elaborate just to perform human experimentation. </p>

<p>Funny enough, there’s an X-Files episode about Mulder and Scully investigating a case about two teens being abducted by aliens. Their investigation leads them to uncovering the alien abduction as part of a top secret Air Force operation. The Air Force used pilots dressed as aliens and experimental aircraft shaped like UFOs as means to enter foreign airspace. Their reason, the enemy sees a jet they shoot it down, but a UFO, they hesitate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the UFO phenomenon is legit, and isn&#39;t a government op, then I have to admit to not believing virtually all alien abduction stories. I can&#39;t believe that a species advanced enough to travel thousands of light years through space would come in a form similar to us, let alone make casual conversation with essentially unimportant people. X-Files I mentioned. Also, the case in that episode was turned into a book by some writer interviewing the two FBI agents, lol.</p>

<p>Going off topic, but if you&#39;re into conspiracy theories, or great TV shows in general, then I&#39;d highly recommend watching the X-Files. It does conspiracy theories, the supernatural, and sci-fi proper. The show did go downhill after season 7, though. Still, if you have time, you should watch it.</p>

<p>Why indeed would aliens fly across the universe just to ask you the time and then tell you you&#39;re lying? Or to make pancakes in your back yard? Why does almost every abductee adopt a new cosmic worldview? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was talking with someone yesterday, and they pointed out that&#39;s it&#39;s really odd how Alien ships have advanced parallel to our own tech. Like the Roswell ship isn&#39;t anything compared to the UFOs we see today. So the idea that UFOs are just us in advanced technological ships kinda makes sense.   </p>

<p>Although, I was meditating in a park one day around 2012, and was focusing on &quot;if aliens exist give me a sign&quot; and not two minutes later a flaming ball of light slowly cut across the sky, then another followed soon after. That alone through me for a loop. Others in the park saw it and one guy said, &quot;if that&#39;s a plane, it&#39;s completely on fire&quot;...  </p>

<p>Like everything we go down the rabbit hole, I can postulate, but never really know what to believe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s just wayyyyyy too many possibilities for something we don&#39;t understand at all, I don&#39;t get when people solidify their opinion on what it is when clearly none of us really have a clue, like I believe in aliens, I just don&#39;t know what &quot;aliens&quot; really means, and I just keep digging this rabbit hole straight down. So many stories of so many different things and so many people claiming different things, hard to pick through the rubble, especially without understanding it one bit. If I had to guess Aliens are either humans in disguise a way to hide technology and things from the people without the people thinking it&#39;s us, or they are literally from another realm or planet or solar system and are here for some sort of purpose. But then again it could be a lot of things other things lol, but that stories pretty cool man I know people with those type of stories but I never experienced one myself. My dad has tho.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it weren&#39;t for Hollywood, videogames and literature constantly feeding us propaganda (about Aliens/space), the concept of *aliens existing* would still be a far away fantasy.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>TPTB **WANT** us to believe Aliens exist and they are hiding them. If they really wanted to keep them hidden, would Hollywood have been pooping out Alien after Alien movie the past 50 years? Especially in recent years with Marvel (MCU) and other block buster space movies  getting released every few months, I really don&#39;t think they&#39;re hiding Aliens.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Or what about all the goverment officials (DOD, CIA, FBI, that Canadian fella Nick pope or whatever, ...) that have come out over the past years saying Aliens exist and (part of) the government have been hiding them since atleast Roswell....</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>So they&#39;re hiding all these ALiens from us, the ALiens are perfectly fine with this (It&#39;s not like they&#39;re technologically thousands of years more advanced...), and at the same time they&#39;re constantly saying us they&#39;re hiding Aliens? (Again, hollywood, media, literature, ...)</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Going to bold this tl;dr, because especially in conspiracy land far too many people are decieved:</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>**TL;DR; </p>

<p>They want us to think they&#39;re hiding Aliens. If they really were hiding Aliens, we wouldn&#39;t be having blockbuster after blockbuster alien movies, we wouldn&#39;t have all these officials telling us(!) they&#39;re hiding Aliens and we sure as shit wouldn&#39;t have 100 years of literature talking about aliens. </p>

<p>They&#39;re just prepping us for the final step in the heliocentric lie... **</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it is gaining traction though.</p>

<p>Who would come out of Marvel movie saying: zomg that was so ridiculous, ALiens don&#39;t exist laawl!</p>

<p>Sure, people would laugh at the ridiclously advanced technology and action, and perhaps even at the interpretation of what aliens would look like, but the concept of Aliens existing is not something people really laugh about anymore...</p>

<p>I think for the majority of people, it goes something like:</p>

<p>Ok there&#39;s no Aliens here (on Earth), but in the infinite vastness of space, there&#39;s bound to be some place (in the entire universe) where there is currently space battles taking place, just like in those movies.</p>

<p>THat&#39;s kinda the premise of &quot;The Universe&quot; (heliocentrism), the odds of us being alone are nihil. These movies just visualize these ideas, make them tangible.</p>

<p>If they wanted to hide Aliens, or keep us away from them (or them from us, somehow?), it makes no sense to spend 100 years seeding these ideas into our minds.</p>

<p>Unless, again, they WANT us to think they&#39;re hiding Aliens...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean yeah people seem to all agree that it&#39;s likely there&#39;s aliens, I do too. Im just saying that our idea of what those aliens are and how they act and the technology that they have probably isn&#39;t close to what the truth is</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I myself spend years brainstorming and fantasing about aliens, what they would like, their technologies etc... More recently I realised that it is exactly these mental gymnastics (about aliens) that is what TPTB are after.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>But hey, I&#39;m just here to provide a different insight. Talking about aliens, ufo&#39;s and stuff is more mainstream than conspiracy in my opinion. I can open up youtube, netflix or even mainstream media (FOX and CNN went there lul) to find &quot;news&quot; and documentairies about aliens. It&#39;s mainstream.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been wondering about them for years and years too, I take every perspective and possibility into account, therefore I can&#39;t say they are one thing or another based on all the different contradicting stories that are releases. My problem with mainstream is that they realized there&#39;s money in it, and when there&#39;s money in it things get embellished or straight up fabricated to get a check, that&#39;s why &quot;Joe Rogan Questions Everything&quot; isn&#39;t on the tv anymore, he went with the intention of proving all the conspiracies each episode, but ended up finding out differently, and the show told him listen you can&#39;t debunk all these things we need it for ratings, and then the show got dropped. Hard to trust the sources but I do know somewhere some bodies telling the truth... Or at least close enough to it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is a French scientist who a) helped invent the internet (through his contributions to a precursor, ARPANET), b) was a close associate of J. Allen Hynek of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Blue_Book">Project Blue Book</a> c) is one of the few people to consider the UFO subject in its totality, while trying to maintain as rigorous a scientific mindset as possible. Oh he is also a Silicon Valley VC type.</p>

<p>Seriously, probably one of the wisest when it comes to <em>how</em> to think about the subject. He&#39;s written a lot so if you just had to pick one thing to read, it would be his <em>Alien Contact</em> trilogy: Dimensions, Confrontations and Revelations. Dude&#39;s been studying this shit since the 60s.</p>
