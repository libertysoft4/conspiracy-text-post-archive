        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-10-09 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/transgirltradwife.html">transgirltradwife</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello, I have struggled with gender dysphoria since at least 2014. I might have struggled with it longer, such as always being uncomfortable with having short hair and facial hair since I hit puberty. But before this, I always saw myself as a man, and a masculine one at that. I played sports and was in the boy scouts and had almost all male friends. I would have beers with my dad and go to hockey games with him and live the typical life of a man. I started to get a bit socially isolated at parts of my teenage years and I found 4chan in about 2011, and would browse there, being encapsulated with the nihilist, self-deprecating culture there. There was porn that was posted there, too. But in 2011, this porn was relatively vanilla and if it was fetishistic it was still in the realms of what is considered normal, like BDSM and stuff, nothing that really affects anyone&#39;s life at all outside the bedroom. </p>

<p>In 2014 however, they started to post trap porn, which awakened something inside of me that wasn&#39;t there before. I didn&#39;t want to fuck these girls or feminine boys, I wanted to be one of them. It reached a point where I couldn&#39;t even browse these threads anymore because I became too jealous of how they looked. If I was never exposed to it, I would still likely be a man today. I didn&#39;t think this way about other girls because I couldn&#39;t see myself in them. There was an element of Hegelian reflection going on here. I did not see myself reflected when looking at cis (not trans) women. It did not strike a chord with me in any way because I saw it as an impossible state to achieve. After all, they&#39;re women because they have vaginas and I have a penis. But when I saw penises attached to women, I could more easily make sense of my own identity with reference to these other individuals.</p>

<p>This was something that was now achievable to me, and I would have never felt this way unless I saw these feminine penises for myself. I knew and knew of trans people before this happened, but I could not resonate with them either, because they were either &quot;born in the wrong body&quot; narratives or trans men who transitioned in the opposite direction. But we are seeing a rapid uptick of people trannifying themselves coincidentally (using the less common &quot;Happening or existing at the same time&quot; <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/coincidentally">definition here</a>) with the rise in popularity of trap porn. I know I&#39;m not the only person this is happening to. </p>

<p>Keeping the topic to 4chan, there was a marked shift in who posted on their /lgbt/ board. Years ago, these users were mostly gay men but now are overwhelmingly traps, traps who now mostly make threads about being unable to pass and otherwise how miserable they are. These are men who could have had a lot of potential in society, but they, too, got suckered into the void of autogynephila and mental illness. </p>

<p>The porn industry is encouraging this. Pornhub releases their &quot;year in review&quot; information every year, that graphically compiles trends and stats from their userbase. &quot;Transgender&quot; was the 6th most trending porn search term of 2017 (and &quot;cuckold&quot; was the number one trending search term, which is a can of worms onto itself). <a href="https://cs.phncdn.com/insights-static/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1-pornhub-insights-2017-year-review-top-gaining-categories-view-time.png">Link</a>. Now do you think that it is rising for no reason whatsoever? Or is this a response to increased visibility and fetishism? Porn companies produce more content based on what&#39;s popular like what all businesses do, so it&#39;s likely creating a feedback loop where they&#39;re creating more porn, which is creating more trans people, which is creating more porn, etc. This is basically how new perversions get normalized.</p>

<p>This trend was captured by sexologist researcher Ray Blanchard, who posited that there are two types of trans women: autogynephiles and homosexual transsexuals. The definition of autogynephilia can be parsed from its Latin parts, &quot;auto&quot; meaning self, &quot;gyne&quot; meaning female or feminine, and &quot;philia&quot; meaning loving. Those individuals in the autogynephilia typology tend to exhibit certain characteristics: they tend to transition later, they tend to prefer women sexually, and they tend to be more masculine and are less likely to pass. Homosexual transsexuals are the opposite, where they are formerly gay men who were such faggots that they became women. They tend to be more feminine, more likely to pass, and prefer men. Blanchard&#39;s theory captures the essence of this dynamic perfectly. I am definitely in the autogynephile category, because despite mostly preferring men, it was the erotic displays of these traps that drew me into this black hole. Many trans people try to deny this link vehemently, saying that since they do not neatly fit into one of these two typologies, or that it doesn&#39;t account for, say, bisexual people, then it must be completely wrong. But just because there tends to be two different trends doesn&#39;t mean everyone neatly fits into one of these two categories. </p>

<p>While porn is being indiscriminate in who they are targeting, it tends to attract vulnerable groups of people, like how flies are drawn to a light. There are numerous studies showing a comorbidity between autism spectrum disorders and trappiness. <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/03/why-are-a-disproportionate-number-of-autistic-youth-transgender.html">Even left-leaning publications</a> and <a href="https://www.mazzonicenter.org/trans-wellness/workshop/autism-trans-non-binary-what%E2%80%99s-it%E2%80%99s-all-about">transgender workshops</a> acknowledge this intersection. <a href="http://www.transadvocate.com/slate-wants-you-to-be-concerned-that-a-disproportionate-number-of-autistic-youth-are-transgender-heres-why-that-concern-is-bs_n_22182.htm">Some trans activists tried to handwave this link away</a> because this one study that this article has cited relies on the DSM IV definition of gender identity disorder, which is a different definition of the DSM V definition of gender dysphoria. The DSM IV definition has been criticized and then removed entirely from the newest definition of the DSM because it often conflated gender nonconformity with that of dysphoria in the diagnostic criteria. Which is a fair criticism, however numerous other studies, using the DSM V definition, are still finding a link. In my own anecdotal experience, this tends to be true. It&#39;s almost a 50/50 autistic/non-autistic split, compared with it being 99/1 in the general population. Numerous doctors in youth gender identity clinics are also purporting this anecdotal experience. The 2015 US Transgender Survey sought to look at the demographics of trans Americans. On page 57 of the report, (pg 61 of <a href="https://transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS-Full-Report-Dec17.pdf">this pdf</a>) found that 30% of their trans respondents had &quot;Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition&quot;, compared with 5% of the general population, and 22% of their trans respondents had &quot;Difficulty doing errands alone, such as visiting a doctor’s office or shopping, because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition&quot; compared with 6% of the general population, clearly showing a statistically significant link between being trans and having a mental disability. This doesn&#39;t necessarily mean autism, it could refer to other conditions like ADHD and executive function disorders, but if you presuppose that about 1 of 5 or 6% of respondents had autism as their condition, which is the estimated percentage of people with autism, then it could likewise be extrapolated that it&#39;s <em>probably</em> true of trans people, too. This survey found no such link between physical disability and being trans, it seems to exactly match that of the general population, so it&#39;s not like the respondents of this survey are likely to be claiming disability for oppression points; they likely are actually telling the truth.</p>

<p>This ties back to vaccinations and how vaccinations give people autism. If they&#39;re giving kids autism, could it also be extrapolated that vaccines are causing transgenderism? I also suspect the elites and deep state are putting anti-androgens in the water supply. Some plastics runoff has feminizing effects, as well as the hormones we are giving cows to give more milk, which we are serving to schoolchildren. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2012/10/20/health/boys-early-puberty/index.html">Some studies indicate that girls (as well as boys, actually) are hitting puberty at younger ages</a> because of this, but couldn&#39;t these same effects be feminizing boys? <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2017/10/02/youre-not-the-man-your-father-was/#b2c250b8b7fd">Men&#39;s testosterone levels are lower now than they were in the past.</a>. We mocked Alex Jones for his &quot;they&#39;re putting chemicals in the water to make the frogs gay&quot; quote but is there actually truth to this? The frogs might not just be turning gay, they might be turning trans as well. And if the frogs are turning trans, then why not our children? Of course Alex Jones seems to have an affinity for trap porn, so he&#39;s not immune from the influence either. Expect to see Alexa or Alexandria Jones in 5 years.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry to all of society that I couldn&#39;t be the man you wanted me to be. I&#39;m an utter autistic weirdo who gave into hedonism and pornography. I know that porn and the chemicals in the water supply did a number on me. Before transitioning, I was a heterosexual man with a beautiful girlfriend but I had sex with a man last night, and I actually felt good about his masculine body juxtaposed with my frail, weak body, and love that he has utter control and dominion over me. I liked this feeling, but I never had these feelings before. Obviously external factors are causing it, given how much of a masculine man I was before.</p>

<p>I tried detransitioning many times and I failed every time. Seeing traps was like the redpill to me. I couldn&#39;t unsee what I saw. It opened a Pandora&#39;s box that gave me autogynephilia and dysphoria. The creators of the Matrix were two trans women whose movie, they say, was an allegory for being trans. Estrogen came in red pills rather than blue pills back then, the movie was about not denying or lying to yourself. But you can&#39;t go back to believing lies because that&#39;s what they are: lies. The blissful ignorance I once had is now unable to be recaptured. I long for those days. But I can&#39;t go back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, the Jews aren&#39;t the ones behind everything. It&#39;s just capitalist decadence.

<p>4chan is generally a good place for factual information but all the trap porn there is causing unintended consequences. There are plenty of places you can go for politics that don&#39;t inundate you with dick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So it sounds more like a fetish than gender dysphoria. And I do think studies have found that repeatedly exposing yourself to something like that can create a fetish. I read somewhere about a study where they created a brown shoe fetish in their test subjects by repeatedly exposing them to the shoe and porn. </p>

<p>Unfortunately you  can’t really unfetish yourself.  Once the damage is done, it’s done.</p>

If so you could look at pictures of women who are built somewhat like you and try to copy their style. And remember contouring is your friend! Watch lots of makeup tutorials on YouTube. I don’t know.

<p>I actually felt good about his masculine body juxtaposed with my frail, weak body, and love that he has utter control and dominion over me. I liked this feeling, but I never had these feelings before. Obviously external factors are causing it, given how much of a masculine man I was before.</p>

I had very much a similar experience but was fortunate enough to loose the delusion before i went and turned my whole world upside down with a transition. Unfortunatly the echochamber that is the transgender community is too uncomfortable with this kind of discusion becuase they know its true for a good large portion of them. And those who arent transgendet but attack posts like this are simply being mislead by the one-sided narrative of the transgender movement. I have to laugh and them, becuase they couldnt possibly know without having been through the gender dysphoria mindfuck themselves. </p>
