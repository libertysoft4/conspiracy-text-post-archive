        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-10-07 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/troothseeker1.html">troothseeker1</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the year of 2000 there were seven countries without a Rothschild owned or controlled Central Bank:</p>

<p>Afghanistan Iraq Sudan Libya Cuba North Korea Iran.</p>

<p>It is not a coincidence that these country, which are listed above were and are still being under attack by the western media, since one of the main reasons these countries have been under attack in the first place is because they do not have a Rothschild owned Central Bank yet.</p>

<p>Iran’s banking system is under threat from the Rothschild empire.</p>

<p>Could gaining control of the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran (CBI) be one of the main reasons that Iran is being targeted by Western and Israeli powers? As tensions are building up for an unthinkable war with Iran, it is worth exploring Iran’s banking system compared to its U.S., British and Israeli counterparts.</p>

<p>The reason that the Islamic Republic of Iran is constantly under threat by Western and Israeli powers could lie in their unique Islamic banking system, that is not comparable or related to the Western or Israeli usury based system.</p>

<p>Some researchers are pointing out that Iran is one of only three countries left in the world whose central bank is not under Rothschild control.</p>

<p>The Rothschild family is slowly but surely having their Central banks established in every country of this world, giving them incredible amount of wealth and power.</p>

<p>The first step in having a Central Bank establish in a country is to get them to accept an outrageous loans, which puts the country in debt of the Central Bank and under the control of the Rothschilds.</p>

<p>If the country does not accept the loan, the leader of this particular country will be assassinated and a Rothschild aligned leader will be put into the position, and if the assassination does not work, the country will be invaded and have a Central Bank established with force all under the name of terrorism.</p>

<p>Central banks are illegally created private banks that are owned by the Rothschild banking family.</p>

<p>The family has been around for more than 230 years and has slithered its way into each country on this planet, threatened every world leader and their governments and cabinets with physical and economic death and destruction, and then emplaced their own people in these central banks to control and manage each country’s pocketbook.</p>

<p>Worse, the Rothschilds also control the machinations of each government at the macro level, not concerning themselves with the daily vicissitudes of our individual personal lives. Except when we get too far out of line.</p>

<p>The only countries left in 2003 without a Central Bank owned or controlled by the Rothschild Family were:</p>

<p>Sudan Libya Cuba North Korea Iran</p>

<p>The Attacks of September 11th were an inside job to invade Afghanistan and Iraq to then establish a Central Bank in those countries.</p>

<p>The only countries left in 2011 without a Central Bank owned or controlled by the Rothschild Family are:</p>

<p>Cuba North Korea Iran</p>

<p>After the instigated protests and riots in the Arab countries the Rothschild finally paved their way into establishing Central Banks, and getting rid of many leaders, which put them into more power.</p>

<p>Objective researchers contend that Iran is not being demonized because they are a nuclear threat, just as the Taliban, Iraq’s Saddam Hussein and Libya’s Muammar Qadaffi were not a threat.</p>

<p>What then is the real reason? Is it the trillions to be made in oil profits, or the trillions in war profits? Is it to bankrupt the U.S. economy, or is it to start World War III? Is it to destroy Israel’s enemies, or to destroy the Iranian central bank so that no one is left to defy Rothschild’s money racket?</p>

<p>It might be any one of those reasons or, worse—it might be all of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t think theres evidence that Banking Cartels start wars in places they don&#39;t have monetary control? Thats completely absurd IMO and it is the main premise of most &#39;conspiracies&#39;. Lets take Vietnam for example, remember the Vietnam war was between 1955-1975. </p>

<p>Most people have no idea that Ho Chi Minh lived in the US for several years, anywhere from 1912-1919. When you realize Minh was a <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol-62-no-2/pdfs/oss-and-rise-of-ho-chi-minh.pdf">CIA asset</a> it becomes quite obvious what he was doing in the states during he&#39;s early years. Fast forward to 1945, an Office of Strategic Services(OSS - predecessor of the modern Central Intelligence Agency.) officer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes_Patti">Archimedes Patti</a> tasked Ho Chi Minh with resolving the Vietnam intelligence problem. </p>

<p>On 6 May 1951, president Ho Chi Minh signed decree 15/SL on establishment of the National Bank of Vietnam, which was an important historical milestone in the development of Vietnam’s monetary and banking systems. The VNB revoked all the enemy’s bank notes in the newly liberated regions and established a unified money market in the North, this centralized the money supply. </p>

<p>We were only fighting the South Vietnam, known as the &quot;Republic of Vietnam&quot; which was in existence from 1955-1975. After the fall of Saigon, the two Vietnams were united but not until July 1976 did the two countries’ administrations and institutions unite. In July 1976, the National Bank of Vietnam (the central bank of Republic of Vietnam) was merged into the <a href="http://humansarefree.com/2013/11/complete-list-of-banks-ownedcontrolled.html">State Bank of Vietnam, which is a Rothchild owned bank</a> </p>

<p>This is why after the fall of Saigon the US military started withdrawing troops because the objective was completed. They successfully implemented control over the banking system. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re trolling or just being ignorant. Saying &quot;Rothschild&quot; is almost a metaphor now to explain central banking just like is like saying &quot;illuminati&quot; to explain TPTB but in reality its all the same-thing.</p>

<p>Rothschilds were real people that are documented in history as the wealthiest families and founders of modern day central banking. They may not operate under the name &quot;Rothschilds&quot; anymore but that bloodline and wealth still very much exist today. The people who truly run the world, we will never hear about them or see them because they don&#39;t exist on paper and operate in total secrecy.. they call it &#39;man behind the curtain&#39; for a reason.</p>

<p>Your outlook is extremely myopic IMO if you can&#39;t see past the name &quot;Rothschilds&quot; or see how TPTB, who not only control/own the banks, also control international governments, intelligence agencies, CIA, MI5, MIC, NASA, MSM, Academic institution, scientific communities, Medical industry, all major corporations and much more. </p>

<p>Its undisputed that the Rothschilds were part of British royalty, especially Nathan Mayer Rothschild and Sir Anthony Nathan de Rothschild. They controlled the banks in the 1700 and 1800&#39;s so why wouldn&#39;t they now? Can you link me with a source that shows how they lost their wealth and power? Because they didn&#39;t they just evolved into something else. </p>

<p>I provided you with evidence that the banking elite started the vietnam war to implement monetary policies that would benefit them in their journey to world domination. </p>

<p>That wasn&#39;t a youtube video. It was a video of George Hunt recording himself on a VHS tape warning us about the Rothschilds that was THEN UPLOADED TO YOUTUBE. So with that logic are you saying all information in youtube videos arnt creditable because its on youtube? I&#39;d only expect to see that level of ignorance from the Gen X population. Look up what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a> is.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you have never heard of the <strong>Bank for International Settlements</strong> so ill enlighten you about it. It&#39;s the Bankers of the Bankers; it&#39;s the all seeing eye. When you hear that the only countries without controlled centralized banks are Iran, North Korea, and Cuba. Its because those are the only counties who&#39;s banks are not controlled by the <a href="https://www.bis.org/about/member_cb.htm?m=1%7C2%7C601">Bank for International Settements</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to know who controls the BIS I suggest reading <a href="https://www.cormael.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Tower_of_Basel_The_Shadowy_History_of_the_Secret_B.pdf">The Tower of Basel</a> or <a href="https://www.realhistorychannel.org/NWO1939-2015.pdf">Planet Rothschild: The Forbidden History of the New World Order</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>These countries may not have a Rothschild bank, I honestly have no clue. But they are &quot;under attack&quot; by western nations for other reasons.</p>

<p>North Korea has been an enemy of the west since its creation. The UN fought a war against it. Mostly America did it, but the whole UN was involved. They are tied to the east, not the west economically.</p>

<p>Cuba is/was a communist aligned nation, setting it against the west. It was isolated from the  west for the better part of a century. Of course it isn&#39;t economically tied to them. You&#39;re not going to find McDonalds, Taco Bell or Starbucks all over Havana either for the same reason. </p>

<p>Afghanistan, and Iraq were invaded to get rid of the Taliban (which was a threat btw), and other terrorists. You addressed this in your post, so let me give a counter point. By Occam&#39;s Razor, the simplest explanation with the most proof is correct. Terrorists had a clear reason to strike. The US had intervened in their nation, and the terrorists wanted them out. The US intervened because of the USSR invading them. Dont tell me that a family of rich, capitalist bankers made the USSR try to expand. Its natural that the US would counter it. Now the Taliban has reason to strike in the US, and everyone had a reason to get involved in their country. There is no reason to assume the Rothschilds are behind it.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Sudan and Libya are embroiled in civil strife and war. I don&#39;t claim to know a ton about either situation, but there are very anti-western attitudes there still. It would be downright dangerous to open a bank in either nation.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Iran. Destabilized because of ISIS among other things. The terrorist organization basically conquered the nation. Not really a time of economic growth. Also, Iran, like ALL of the countries you mentioned, has never liked the west.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>For all I know, you might be right. It is possible that there is some conspiracy to destabilize these countries to make money. Crazier things have happened I suppose. However, all of your points have clear counters, and logic dictates that without stronger evidence and proof, the simpler side to justify, that can provide better proof, is probably right. </p>
