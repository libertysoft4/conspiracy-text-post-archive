<h3>&quot;Know that everything that we do this very day will either be lost to history completely, or studied for generations to come, and that the choice is up to us.</h3>

<p>This is all a game, folks; and you are all the players that matter. History is being written while the masses sleep. History is written by the few, not the many. And history is written by the victors. If you aren&#39;t one of those with liberty, it is because you or your forbearers were on the losing side at some point, and that dynamic tension is yet to be resolved.&quot; </p>

<p>It guarantees a &quot;wow&quot; factor and it safeguards that the information will be made available no matter what.</p>

<p>If the enemy is all powerful but only manages to rule due to deception , you would be crazy to try and fight them in the shadows. Its unlikely that you are better than then, and it&#39;s unethical to endanger your knowledge  in case you lost. Also, if they could counter a vast awakening they wouldn&#39;t be rulling from the shades, which is an extra reason why you should come out publically at once.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;d be fast event relying on the massed distribution, as far and wide as technologically possible, of documents/videos/information of every kind detailing the various dealings and goings on of the organization in question. Not opinions. Not &quot;Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s strange?&quot; leading questions. Cold hard data of an incontrovertible nature. </p>

<p>There would be no &quot;timed&quot; drops and trickling-down of info. No riddles and specific pandering to niche audiences. No talking head videos high on rousing sentiment but low on specifics: any appearances would be to specifically state the entirety of the situation and doing so with the necessary evidence at hand. Any real organization would exploit the time-wasting theatrics to deal with the leaker quickly and permanently. The information would need become universal and fast.</p>

<p>People already believe or want to believe that they are being fleeced: the point of contention is largely a matter of &quot;who is it that&#39;s doing the fleecing?&quot;. If actual and real world evidence of even absurd claims were to arise - comparable to, for example, the recent reveal of the cult that influenced the President of South Korea - there&#39;d be a strong public reaction. </p>

<p>People do not want to entertain the idea that all they know is wrong and fake . People will deny rock solid evidence shown to them if it’s too painful to consider.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People can, have, and will adapt quickly to shocking circumstances.  If the evidence is truly &quot;rock solid&quot; will stand on its own two legs for most, even if - yes - there will always be people bound by some personal reason to deny a fact at any cost. .</p>

<p>&quot;Slowly conditioning the populous&quot; is what you do when you want to create a pliant mob. You can do that without even bothering with evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would look very similar to what are seeing with trump. If you feed the beast, it will protect you (clintons getting away with running a phony charity that acts as a front for a massive international white collar crime syndicate involved in trafficking little kids, barry soweto getting away with using phony opo research to illegally acquire fisa warrants to spy on his political opponent). If you vow to starve the beast, it will go after you, your family, your business, your reputation, it will make up horrible lies about you (russia hoax, thousands of fake media stories over the years, fake sex assault allegations). If you want to make the government bigger you can get away with anything, if you want to make the government smaller they will bring the wrath of god down upon you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would take a lot of fucking time and effort, a slow process so that the elite don’t catch on that you’re not on their sides, giving away as much info as possible and making as much progress to change as possible so as not to tip them off and not get murdered. That doesn’t mean they’re going to lose they might defeat the rebellion, or the shadow war might take 80 years to complete. But it’s happening whether you believe who’s on who’s team or who’s winning or not. </p>

<p>Then it would look like him being assassinated for it not long after. Listen to the desperation and the tone of his voice in that speech. It’s as if he is saying “please hear my words and take action” without coming out and actually saying it.</p>

<p>Once they got some momentum and a following... It would look similar to every smear piece you’ve ever heard. Racist, homophobic, rapist blah blah. All the -icts and -icsms labels would be used. Fake accusations of metoo type stuff. </p>

<p>Half the country would be convinced this new leader is the next Hitler. Media smears non stop, they’d prob even make up a fake FBI investigation to smear the person. </p>

<p>Does this sound familiar? Trump is a zionist shill but he did say in the campaign he’d re-open the 9/11 commision... then he got a call from Bibi and it never came up again. </p>
