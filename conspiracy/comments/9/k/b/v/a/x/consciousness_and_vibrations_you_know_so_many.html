<p>This is hardcore science. The guy talks real quick and the slides are presented real quick, making it hard to keep up.</p>

<p>But I think it will be worth it if it&#39;s something that interests you.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the conspiracy?</p>

<p>There are numerous ways to affect vibrations within the brain.</p>

<p>There are also vast amounts of study that prove beyond a doubt that healthy food is necessary for proper brain functioning.</p>

<p>Some of us here are believe TPTB have a plan to reduce the population and maintain it at a certain number.</p>

<p>Some of us here are pretty sure we&#39;re observing increasing signs of mental instability among the general population.</p>

<p>The conspiracy - Some of us here don&#39;t think it&#39;s an accident or unexplainable phenomenon.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to have to do way more research on this (this is the first I&#39;ve heard of the &quot;Orch OR&quot; theory &quot;orchestrated objective reduction&quot;) to see if the vibrations of the microtubules can be affected by devices such as cellphones or 4G and 5G networks.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to be surprised if they do. It&#39;s pretty difficult for me to dismiss certain parallels between the increase of digital transmissions and mental instability among the general population.</p>

<p>As I said before, diet is probably a very significant factor in the overall equation.</p>

<p>Also, I would like to restate that it always seems to come back to vibrations.</p>

<p>The studies this guy and his partners are conducting ask a good question - Does consciousness exist &quot;before&quot; life?</p>

<p>Anyone familiar with Schumann&#39;s Resonances probably has a better understanding of why this is possible.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy the journey.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39; might be interesting to play around with sound frequencies, to cause a vibration that might resonate and promote the growth of hair. That is if you have any tangible roots. Couple that with diet that helps promote hair growth. And cold showers maybe you can cure it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve got some good stuff to add here but I&#39;m just gonna copy+paste a couple relevant posts of mine to make it easier. First, which is most relevant to your comment, is a post I wrote regarding the Schumann resonance, what it is, how it works etc.<br/>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Soulvation/comments/88qjug/the_schumann_resonance_what_is_it_how_does_it">https://www.reddit.com/r/Soulvation/comments/88qjug/the_schumann_resonance_what_is_it_how_does_it</a>  </p>

<p>Next is a comment I wrote in response to a question asking &quot;does a certain amount of consciousness control the world?&quot;  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d say yes, at least to a general degree. I&#39;ve been studying theories of consciousness and practicing expanding my consciousness for a few years now (meditation, lucid dreaming, astral projection), and I&#39;ve come to a conclusion that there&#39;s three general factors to consider in regards to what steers or controls a conscious individual or group consciousness:  </p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>Rudimentary consciousness. This can be defined as the sum of all physical consciousnesses that make up a body (ie. For an animal/plant/fungal life this is the sum consciousness of all the cells that make it up. For a planet it would be all plant/animal/fungal life, all the earth, and all the water, etc). This is often referred to as &quot;ego&quot; or your body on autopilot. The study of this comes under genetics. It&#39;s basically physical code to provide an appropriate response to environmental stimuli.  </p></li>
<li><p>Social consciousness. This can be defined as the influences that the environment and other conscious individuals have on an individual. These present new information and expand the choice of response actions in a rudimentary consciousness. The study of this comes under memetics, wherein &quot;memes&quot; refer to cultural units of information.  </p></li>
<li><p>Extended consciousness. I believe this to be what some refer to as the &quot;soul&quot;. It is the point of connection between a physical conscious entity and universal consciousness. The rope that if you were to follow would take you back to the source. This includes information from &quot;past lives&quot; stored in the subconscious, and an individual&#39;s morphogenetic field which permeates into the spacetime immediately surrounding a conscious individual (this field extends to around about a metre out from the focal point of consciousness and a few minutes into the past and future).  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Then when considering consciousness on a larger scale you can factor in things like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundredth_monkey_effect">&quot;100th monkey effect&quot;</a>, whereby information spreads unexplainably fast among a population once that information has reached a critical mass.  </p>

<p>And also there&#39;s potentially the Saturn-Moon matrix, which seems to be some 4 dimensional machine/simulation/influence on the Earth via Saturn and the moon which acts to control and steer events to a single, or select few, timelines, and to encourage souls to reincarnate on this planet over and over again with their memories wiped each time. This has been speculated to be a kind of energy farm, a prison planet, a game etc. There&#39;s tons of theories as to why, but they each at least seem to agree on one thing: that it&#39;s controlled on/by Saturn and the moon. For more research just type &quot;Saturn&quot; into the reddit search bar. There&#39;s been plenty of great posts on it in the past and I would only butcher it by trying to condense it for this comment, so it&#39;s worth having a good read into that in your own time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries! Felt the same way myself a few months ago, which is what spurred me to learn more about it so I could share. Until I went and read some fundamental material on electrical circuits it was never easy for me to understand what exactly it meant, so I went and learned a lot so that I could hopefully share the information in a way that people understood without having to go through all the effort I went through lol. Wouldn&#39;t discourage it though. I learned a lot in doing that. </p>

<p>They aren&#39;t in the west. Birthrates are going down and populations are dying. Look at Germany and Japan and look at the low birthrates in America. Over 50% of all white and black babies in America are now due to be aborted in the womb.</p>

<p>The world does not have a population problem. This is a forced media meme. The Powers that Be are trying to MEME depopulation in to reality. Look at Infinite War, the hero was a maniac who wanted to genocide half the population of the universe in order to make things more sustainable. Less of us are easier to control than more of us.</p>

<p>You sound like a cultist.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in my mid 20s too. I remember in elementary and middle school they told me the icecaps would be melted and California would be submerged by 2014. Now it is 2050. Environmentalism is a doomsday cult, and the doomsday is always right around the corner. The cult of environmentalism is the ideology that supports many billion dollar industries. </p>

<p>The elites are very motivated to make you think you&#39;re destroying earth and to discourage you from having kids. Less of us are easier to control. They lecture us about carbon footprints while flying to meetings all over the world in private jets. Fuck off with your cult of global warming indoctrination bullshit.</p>

<p>However, I have studied vibrations and how the connectedness of everything is very real.   </p>

<p>There&#39;s a church in Scotland called the Rosalyn chapel. In that church (it&#39;s beautiful) it&#39;s decorated with artwork head to toe all over it. There are 13 motifs around the church.<br/>
Those motifs are the visual representation of certain musical notes.   </p>

<p>Within the church, if you had a copper plate and sand on it, and you played the notes A, C or E major, the vibrations of the notes would vibrate the sand particle to make various images. These images are the motifs around the church. It is amazing.</p>

<p>Video here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlRB1nNmFPQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?</a></p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>THEN I research that there is a device called a Tonoscope. This is a device where when you play a sound it photographs the vibrations formed in a film of water. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>It has shown that the sound for the Buddhist chant OM makes an image like the great mandala and sacred geometry. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ourwonderlife.com/om-tonoscope-the-sri-yantra/">http://www.ourwonderlife.com/om-tonoscope-the-sri-yantra/</a>  </p>

<p>Sound/Frequency/Vibration is EVERYTHING.</p>

<p>It has healing properties. It has controlling properties and the powers that be are well aware of these things.</p>

He told me lots of interesting stories but what stuck was his amazing knowledge of electronics, frequencies and vibrations. He told me that by playing certain tones on his key boards he could take people in the crowd to high states of euphoria or literally make them shit their pants - this was in the late 60&#39;s so who knows what music is doing to young brains.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just got my first &quot;smart phone&quot; after my flip phone of ten years died and I could not find another flip phone anywhere locally in the Omaha metro area. I made a deal with myself that it would be off whenever not in use. So far so good.... except I am also an audio engineer and have a nice pair of full range monitors for mixing that I l sometimes leave said phone by while mixing. It constantly picks up electromagnetic interference at random intervals even when &quot;OFF&quot;. It&#39;s 100% the phone causing it. It would seem that even when my phone is off in the middle of the night it is sending/receiving signal. WTF?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve experienced this too. Studio monitors do pick up buzz at the slightest thing. Ground loops can be mysterious? I’ve gone on a few Sherlock style hunts over the years...Or perhaps the sum of the parts/battery etc of the phone.... these surely create some sort of field that a monitor would interact with...I think when the phone is off it’s not signalling per se otherwise the old bill would bust a lot more people... but if it’s a new one - who knows... probably, this is conspiracy after all. I read somewhere 1 in 3 people in the US now have some form of listening/siri-esque ‘smart’ device in their home.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I mean discretion; I was lying in bed on a phone, knowing this would be misinterpreted.  Discretion regarding all diet, information, sources and all.  The post is probably the most important information an individual can acquire.  I am a poor poster, frequently on mobile, I apologize for the confusion.  But nevermind that, while I&#39;m sitting at a console, I must briefly state I smoked an unknown but considerable quantity of 5-meo-dmt one night, 13 or so years ago, very drunk (as I was terrified) underwent the most profound experience of vibrating, and things about vibrations, I can&#39;t remember more but I searched  the terms and voila that was the path.  It sounds petty and insignificant now but it led to greater insight and willingness to open the mind.  I don&#39;t doubt the most amazing of possibilities, clearly the control of that and those chemicals has the suppression of this information in mind, CLEARLY.</p>

<p>I could say a lot, lot more but long comments are tedious.  The realization of that then progressed (naturally) to greater and more complex awareness (a 911 &quot;holy. shit.&quot; moment around 2006) further reflection on historical matters, the study, recording and interpretation thereof.  Questions about spirit, pharmacology, biology, etc etc, yes indeed holy shit gentlemen and ladies we are in a serious mix here.  I do not wish to expound further on the matter at this time but it is holy shit time....imho. </p>

<p>Then why are populations worldwide growing at record rates?</p>

<p>They aren&#39;t in the west. Birthrates are going down and populations are dying. Look at Germany and Japan and look at the low birthrates in America. Over 50% of all white and black babies in America are now due to be aborted in the womb.</p>

<p>The world does not have a population problem. This is a forced media meme. The Powers that Be are trying to MEME depopulation in to reality. Look at Infinite War, the hero was a maniac who wanted to genocide half the population of the universe in order to make things more sustainable. Less of us are easier to control than more of us.</p>
