<p>What does Trump think about things like government surveillance? </p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t think about it because it doesn&#39;t affect him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What does he think about the opioid crisis? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He thinks it&#39;s bad because opioid junkies tend to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/28/opioid-epidemic-selects-white-victim-black-addict">white</a> as opposed to being black or brown. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is he doing to combat the mental health crisis/ rise in suicides among men in the United States?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump is going to do nothing because he does not know how to combat the problem. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what happens when your news department has to turn a profit, they cover stories that will get the most clicks and views and too often those stories have no affect on peoples&#39; lives like the media not shutting up about that old whore Stormy Daniels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like there&#39;s a lot of people that care about those topics and they could still make profit off them. The reason they make money off topics such as Stormy Daniels is because the media says that&#39;s the hot topic and people follow the lead. A lot of people are brainwashed by the news and what they are saying is going on and don&#39;t take time to think for themselves. </p>

<p>I want to know why there are homeless people on sidewalks in almost every city/town in the United States while we&#39;re sending huge amounts of aid to other countries. Ok, there&#39;s always supposedly a threat of terrorism or whatever but people in our country need help. Maybe if the media reported more on the issues in their streets that they can see with their own eyes on a regular basis, people would start to realize it&#39;s a real problem. We need a news media with less drama and he said she said bullshit.</p>

<p>People of Interest: 
(This list is a bit hard to follow because of the long names. This chart : <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/a-whos-who-of-the-saudi-royal-family-2015-2%C2%A0will">http://www.businessinsider.com/a-whos-who-of-the-saudi-royal-family-2015-2 will</a> help you clarify who is who.)</p>

<p>Do you remember how President Trump visited Saudi Arabia back in May of 2017? Do you remember how warmly he was greeted by King Salman? I do. It was a spectacle. Why was he greeted so welcomingly? After all, President Obama&#39;s reception was... shall we say, less than grand. Do you remember how after Trump&#39;s visit, Saudi Arabia started becoming more open in their policies? Women can drive there now. Did you notice how the Syrian rebellion became quiet? Did you notice how quickly ISIS was crushed after the visit? Why did Saudi Arabia suddenly want to get their oil companies listed on the NYSE? What could have caused this? 
To answer this, we have to look a little further back. Back to around 2010. 
It all goes back to fracking. You see, the Kindom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has always relied heavily on its vast petrol reserves for wealth and prosperity. And they were ruthless. OPEC. The cartel of gasoline. You can&#39;t count the number of times throughout history that OPEC used its power to crush governments, manipulate prices, control supplies, and fund activities. If there ever was a international group of bullies, OPEC was it. And at the head of this organization was the mighty KSA. 
Then came the fracking boom. Suddenly, the world was no longer at the mercy of OPEC. This made them nervous. So, they did what they always do. They pumped out more petroleum, driving the price of gas to lowest in decades. What was their objective? To bankrupt these fracking businesses. KSA is rich. Very rich. They figured, we&#39;ll just drive gas prices unbelievably low and take the loss until all these fracking business startups crumble.

<p>Do you remember how cheap gas got between 2013-2016? It was ridiculous, wasn&#39;t it? But what they didn&#39;t count on was just how cheap fracking had become. So many of these business didn&#39;t go bankrupt. So they took another step. To convince the world that fracking was bad for the environment. So they lobbied and supplied funds to the Democratic party. Why? Because the leftist are usually the ones who support ANY and ALL environmental regulations. Do you remember all the legal battles that fracking had to go through? Hell, it&#39;s still illegal in most blue states. Do you now understand why the Saudis donated so much money to the Clinton campaign? She was HEAVILY favored to win and if she did, you can bet your ass that illegalizing fracking would have been on the top of her list, returning us to dependence on arab oil. But... this didn&#39;t work either. Fracking continued. And then, a shitstorm of reality hit them hard. 
You see, KSA had vastly underestimated the amount of total shale reserves in North America. They had no idea that so much of this stuff exists. They thought maybe they could ride it out if the reserves would dry up in a decade or so. But nope. We have enough shale to supply us for at least 50 years. Hmmm... big problem. 
So, if you&#39;re King Salman, what do you do?

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there&#39;s only one thing you can do. Give up the reliance on oil production and try to use existing wealth to stay wealthy. To modernize its trade to include more than just exports of oil. They would need to build an entire industrial country from scratch. To do that, he needed the help of the USA. And that&#39;s where President Trump comes in. 
You see, the May 2017 meeting between Trump and King Salman (and his son Mohammad), was not just another meeting. It was a business meeting. King Salman asked Trump for help. Trump was more than willing to give it (like listing the oil companies on the NYSE) but his help would come with a price. Liberalization and the stop of illegal funding. No more contributions to American politics. No more supplying funds to terrorists or splinter groups. King Salman took the deal. All of a sudden, women were allowed to drive. ISIS was retreating. Syrian rebels suddenly ran out of ammunition. Yay. All good up to this point. 
Now comes the bad 
Not all the royalties in KSA are into this. They don&#39;t like losing the power they once had. What&#39;s worse, they don&#39;t want to become liberal. They now start resenting King Salmon. They start plotting against him. At the forefront of this movement is none other than the previous Deputy Crown Prince, Muqrin, and his son, Mansour (the man killed in the helicopter crash of 11/5/17).

<p>October 1, 2017. The top floors of Mandalay Bay isn&#39;t Mandalay Bay, but is Four Seasons, owned by billionaire Talal. Who was occupying that whole floor that night? I can&#39;t remember where, but I heard that the whole floor was reserved for that week. Now, no one would do that unless they were Saudi royalty. We don&#39;t know for sure, but my guess is Crown Prince Mohammad. We know it wasn&#39;t King Salman, because he was in Russia at the time.<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/saudi-russia-visit-putin-oil-middle-east%C2%A0">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/saudi-russia-visit-putin-oil-middle-east </a>
The plan is to take out the crown prince. Then kill King Salman. With the King and the Crown Prince dead, who is next in line? Yup. The former deputy crown prince, Muqrin. So, posing as terrorists who wanted to buy the guns for some terrorist attack, they dupe the CIA or FBI to supply the guns to the death squad. Their real plan is to climb the stairs right after the deal and kill the VIP in the floors above them. This is why the weapons cashe was located on the 32nd floor. They would only have to climb a few stairs or take the elevator up a little to start the killing. Now, here&#39;s what happened that night:

<p>** With the post from u/kneejerk55, I have modified the events of the night. I think it fits much better** 
Paddock is the contact man to supply the guns. He meets a couple of assassins ahead of time (remember, the shooting starts at 10:05). At this point, Paddock is thinking this is a gun deal. Only a few magazines are loaded. He merely wants to show the customers how to load the chamber etc... What he doesn&#39;t know is that the advance team was sent to secure the floor. That all but one entry point to the floor would be barricaded (crucial since the reason Campos becomes suspicious of the blocked doors is what ultimately leads him to investigate) The reason for the barricade is that once the assault starts, the assassins want to make sure to impede the authorities as much as possible from reaching the top floors. 
CIA/FBI (or Trump&#39;s own intelligence) got wind of the assassination that was about to take place. Immediate action is taken to round up the assassins. Remember, we&#39;re talking about an army of assassins here. You can&#39;t kill a Crown Prince who&#39;s protected by 30 armed bodyguards by pulling a Jack Ruby. I estimate at least 20 assassins in total.

<p>What the assassins didn&#39;t know was that the prince had disguised himself as a regular dude to enjoy the nightlife in Vegas. (Saudi princes have been known to do this) He had slipped away from the Mandalay and was at the Tropicana playing some cards. As soon as the FBI (or some other agency) learned of the assassination plot, they stormed the Tropicana and extracted the prince. The video can be seen here. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVHmshtmDqo%5BEmbed%5D">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVHmshtmDqo[Embed]</a> They lead him out of the casino and escort him to the nearest helipad to be picked up. BUT, on the way, they encounter some resistance from a few assassins. Hence the firefight at the airport. Eventually, he makes it to the chopper and is whisked away. This explains the flight radar reports you see all over the net. 
Meanwhile, the FBI has gathered up as many of the assassins as they can. A few are armed with sidearms. They don&#39;t have rifles yet because the rendezvous with Paddock hasn&#39;t occurred yet. Hence the random firefights at various casinos that night. A few are killed. Hence the Laura Loomer videos of covered up dead people.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAZIpSUuM%C2%A0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAZIpSUuM </a>

<p>The assassins already in Paddock&#39;s room gets a call. They are told that the Prince is not in his suite above. That he&#39;s being escorted out of the Tropicana. They start panicking. If they get caught in this plot to assassinate the crown prince, not only are they dead, but their employer is dead as well. They come up with a plan. They will kill Paddock and start firing on the crowd below. They&#39;re gonna make him a crazy lone gunman. So they kill Paddock. They break a window. They pick up a rifle and start firing at the crowd below. After a couple of mags, they realize that the other mags aren&#39;t loaded! Holy fuck. They start reloading as fast as possible. This is why the average time between bursts of fire is over 40 seconds. One of them gets an idea. Let me go to the other room and break that window and shoot at the fuel tanks at a nearby airport. This will draw the police away from the Mandalay and they can escape. So he goes and attempts just that. Unfortunately, the tanks do not blow up. By this time, Jesus Campos is knocking on the door. So they just unload on him. This is why there are (supposedly) 200 shots through the door. Campos escapes a lethal shot and calls in security. 
Now the assassins are getting nervous. They realize that someone in the hotel knows that someone is firing. They fire as much as they can. They are thinking as soon as this barrage is done, we run. But the swat team starts knocking on the door. Fuck. The assassins realize they&#39;re screwed. So the first one shoots himself. (This is the first of the single shots you hear at the end). The second assassin isn&#39;t so sure.

<p>He doesn&#39;t want to die. So after 10 seconds of courage gathering, he shoots himself as well. 
The SWAT team bursts in and finds 3 bodies. They start asking questions. But because the FBI is already there (remember, they extracted the prince) they take over. They quickly assess the situation. They realize the implications. They remove the 2 assassins bodies, take a picture of Paddock lying there, and release it to 4chan to solidify their narrative. 
Paddock is made the patsy. Why? Because if a failed Saudi assassination attempt was responsible for the deaths, if the FBI/CIA had supplied the guns that killed 58 innocent people (not counting Paddock since he&#39;s an asset), then two things would happen. One, we would demand that we go to war with Saudi Arabia. And two, which ever organization that Paddock worked for would be utterly dismantled. 
Wew lads, I know. Quite a story. Now, let&#39;s fast forward to one month later. 
We know a missile was intercepted by the Saudi military on November 3 or 4th. This was probably the final effort by the anti King Salman group. This was their last ditch effort to kill him. OR, it was staged to give King Salman the excuse to round everyone up in retaliation of the assassination attempt. We know that MASSIVE raids and the rounding of Saudi princes took place on the 5th. I will guarantee you that all these people are anti Salman/Mohammad. And who was just killed? Yes. The son of Muqrin, Mansour. Mansour&#39;s death was retaliation. I have no doubt of it. He was executed. 
Ok, now that this has happened, what&#39;s next? Well, my guess will be that we will learn all of the funding that has been coming out of Saudi Arabia for the past decade. It will expose their connections to the DNC. We will learn that they have been at the root of all the turmoil in the Middle East. Then, they&#39;ll all be executed.

P.S. The story works just fine with Paddock as a private illegal guns dealer, meaning the FBI/CIA only helped to foil the assassination attempt. He doesn&#39;t have to be working for an alphabet agency. However, given the clues from his life style (or the utter lack of it), I&#39;m betting that he was an asset.</p>

<p>I wish the press would ask the President who was really responsible for 9/11.</p>

<p>But we know that would never happen.</p>
