<p>Went home... to their families and friends who saw them on-camera during the incident and in interviews with the media afterward. Those who had to pretend that their spouses, relatives, or friends died had to go home and explain why no one else knew who those people were or how they actually didn&#39;t die.</p>

<p>And these people all kept up the charade because they got a check for a few hundred bucks. And they&#39;ll swear it was all real until they die, because of a few hundred bucks.</p>

<p>Maybe, but I still don&#39;t understand why you think the Crowds on Demand ad has anything to do with it. My point is that for something like this, you wouldn&#39;t hire random people off the street for $15/hour if you wanted everyone involved to stay silent forever. </p>

<p>Maybe one or two people would get ignored, but with all of the thousands of people that they&#39;ve hired for 9/11, Sandy Hook, the Boston Marathon bombing, the Vegas Shooting, and every other false flag event that you guys think had crisis actors in it... how are there not at least a few dozen people coming out about it by now?</p>

<p>And with all of these events, is everything completely untraceable? There&#39;s no scripts, check stubs, contracts, phone calls, meetings, rehearsals, etc. that can be recorded or photographed to support a leaker&#39;s story?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay I think your question is perfectly valid and its a good point to make while playing devils advocate. These people that go on craigslist looking for jobs have absolutely no association with whats being conspired in the after math.. they genuinely don&#39;t see how they are part of the bigger picture. For example, in CPR class they tell you to pick someone to call 911 and dont assume someone will willingly make the call because everybody already assume somebody else is already doing it. I know thats not the best example but do you see what im getting at?
Thats why I&#39;m trying to make the point it wouldn&#39;t be that hard for TPTB to cover those loose ends, or the hole &quot;crisis actor&quot; thing could be a complete smoke screen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>your explanation is that people - thousands of people, in some cases - were tricked into playing crisis actors at these major, widely-reported news events, somehow without realizing they were participating in staging that event?</p>

<p>and that the bystander effect explains why even those who have put it together have not come forward?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re looking for an answer that doesn&#39;t exist in human nature. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_of_silence">Spiral of silence</a> somewhat explains this. When people turn on the MSM they&#39;re ready to believe what they see and public opinion is already molded.. people dont turn on the news to be skeptical. 
If people already have there minds made up about an event any opposing viewpoint is automatically deemed ludicrous, especially if this alternative viewpoint in coming from a paid actor about a tragedy its called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a>. </p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://archive.org/details/HQWeNeedToTalkAboutSandyHookFullVideoInHigherQuality">Sandy Hook</a> Why did none of the crisis actors come forward? Its not what people do.
Same with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3noExmsCRyg">Flight 77</a> we know that plane didn&#39;t hit the pentagon and that it landed else where. So where are all the passengers that could of spoken up to prevent the US from partaking in the longest war in american history?</p>

<p>People don&#39;t operate at a level of moral integrally in which you&#39;re assuming they do.</p>

<p>Voat is another website, similar to Reddit and they have a subverse dedicated to conspiracy theories too. They do their best to not be censor-happy like Reddit, though it results in some rather course language if you can stomach it. I just &quot;emigrated&quot; there to go down some conspiracy rabbit holes.</p>

<p>Paddock had no history of mental illness</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No <em>documented</em> history. Big difference.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Paddock  made  numerous  claims  to  friends  and  family  that  he  consistently  felt  ill,  in  pain  or fatigued. An interview was conducted with a physician in Las Vegas who identified himself as Paddock’s primary care physician since 2009. He last saw Paddock as a patient on or around October 2016 for an annual checkup. He recalled the only major ailment Paddock had was a slip and fall accident at a casino approximately 3 years earlier, which caused a muscle tear. The physician described Paddock as “odd&quot; in behavior with “little emotion” shown. <strong>He believed Paddock may have had bipolar disorder however, Paddock did not want to discuss that topic further with him.</strong> Paddock also refused anti-depressant medication but accepted prescriptions for anxiety. He noted Paddock seemed fearful of medications, often refusing to take them. He did not believe Paddock was abusing any medications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His father was also a diagnosed psychopath (according to the FBI) and we know that genetics plays a significant role in many psychopathic traits, such as the capacity for empathy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Paddock also reportedly spouted conspiracy theories, saying for example that the FEMA camps built for refugees who lost their homes in Hurricane Katrina in 2005 were “a dry run for law enforcement and military to start kickin’ down doors and... confiscating guns.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another woman recalled overhearing a man that looked like Paddock talking to another man at a restaurant in las Vegas days before the massacre. She told police that Paddock was ranting about two separate events that took place in the 1990s. One was the standoff at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, in 1992, where a right-wing activist resisting federal weapons charges moved with his family to a remote cabin, leading to an 11-day armed standoff with authorities. The other was the 51-day standoff in Waco, Texas, between a Christian cult and police, which led to the deaths of more than 80 people, including 22 children.</p>

<p>but this is r/conspiracy so according to them a youtube video with a few thousand views of a pixel is more credible than vice.</p>

22,000 people were at the festival. What are the chances that 6 of them would die in the coming months. ONLY 6. 
7452 people die every day in America.
One of those died in her sleep, perhaps stress related, heart attack or stroke. No COD given. Half of those were struck out anyway. A few of them didn&#39;t even have a source confirming death or identity. 
This all just seems like hullabaloo.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if some of these overlap, but I thought I&#39;d just quickly do this (took me under a minute) so the guy replying below me would stop bitching</p>

<p>I cover all the dead witnesses on this podcast, If you scroll down you can read about the dead witnesses. Pretty crazy. </p>

<p>Also the one no one mentions is the guy who killed himself and his retarded daughter when he found out he was to be questioned about the shooting. Apparently it was his phone charger in the room or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure that there is anything fishy about this. It seems normal that out of 1000 plus survivors some died after the event. Also many people thought it was multiple shooters initially. The rate of fire was so high bc pump stocks. Many people don&#39;t go on record and redact their initial opinion after the event but instead just try to deal and live with the trauma and don&#39;t relive the events to cope.</p>

<p>Feds haven&#39;t tried using this as an excuse/explanation. Why? Seems like mental illness would be the obvious thing for them to blame it on (or money troubles), but instead we just keep getting told &quot;no motive&quot; every time it comes up. Shit don&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>The fact that he was highly organized but chose targets at random.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a fascinating exercise: Every major newsworthy event over the past 20 years has been the target of massive speculation regarding its potential to be a part of some vast conspiracy. Every mass killing is a false flag. Every crashed plane was downed by some shadowy agency. Some people even try to claim that natural disasters are a part of these conspiracies.</p>

<p>So... does <em>anything</em> bad ever happen that&#39;s NOT a grand conspiracy? It seems like we should expect some bad things to happen. There are violent people in the world. Some of them are not socially stable. We should expect that, logically, to result in some terrible events.</p>

<p>But it seems like conspiracy theory culture is asserting that this never happens. Why is that?</p>

<p>Go far enough down that rabbit hole, and you&#39;ll find a vast web of conspiracy... albeit an unintentional one.</p>

<p>Why were there so many wounds such as Campos&#39; that seemed to leave such an acutely tight in diameter wound which seemed to not do much damage? Is this due to the distance and slowing of velocity from hotel to fest and the resistance of the bullet shooting through it? Is that why it didn&#39;t do much damage? </p>

All the authorities would need to do is plant guns in his room for The post-“suicide” photo shoot (which they did) ...... I mean, why was that photo even released? And so early? It’s odd to me. Generally, nothing related to a case as big as this would be released to the public, during an active and ongoing  investigation.... and yet they chose to release a photo of the suspect, deceased, in his hotel room, apparently holding a gun? I mean come on! In any normal case, ESPECIALLY a high profile case, would they release anything let alone a freaking photo of the dead suspect!</p>

<p>Just because someone is old and have money doesn’t mean they can’t develop mental illness.  Maybe he had Alzheimer’s, maybe he had delusions, whatever it was there was clearly something off.</p>

<p>He lugged all the guns up there to use them, once he realized the cops were on him (camera in the hallway), he offed himself. </p>

<p>It is interesting to think of various plots of why, but it was probably lonely/depressed guy that wanted to go out in infamy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you.  On the one hand depression doesn&#39;t care about your bank account balance. But it&#39;s important to acknowledge that it is anger focused inward.  I could head over to the suicide watch sub and post a survey asking if they  fantasize about taking as many people with them as possible when they go. There is no way anyone would answer yes. Depression is self-focused and energy-depleting. A depressed person does not have it in them to carefully plan a large scale assault on strangers at a public venue in a location with superior security.</p>

<p>Do you think he&#39;s alive and in hiding? His time of death listed as noon the next day is so bizarre.</p>

<p>Casinos are the safest place on the planet. Honestly, if you plan to have a heart attack you should do it in a Vegas casino. Help will be on you before you hit the floor.  </p>

<p>That security is next level/eff you stuff. We&#39;re told  he wandered freely around the hotel, located the service elevator, and then used that elevator to haul his trolley of weapons - enough to arm three SEAL teams - up to the 32nd floor. </p>

<p>Really? We&#39;re not talking about an interstate  Holiday Inn where all the guests are in bed by 10. It&#39;s Vegas. The other city that never sleeps. How many times have you been alone in any elevator in a Vegas casino?  He couldn&#39;t have used a service elevator to carry in a birthday cake without security waiting to chat with him about casino do&#39;s and dont&#39;s. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also strange that LE reported an enormous supply of bomb making material in his car.</p>

<p>This guy booby-trapped his hotel room. We&#39;re told he never had any intention of leaving alive. So why have explosive material loaded to the gills in the car?  </p>

<p>Why did the security guard report he was shot with a bb gun? (Weird AF)</p>

<p>This is where I started...maybe it&#39;ll give you some pause for thought. You&#39;ll notice some/many of the vids included in the article(s) are missing. They have been working overtime at YT to make sure as many of these vids are removed as possible.</p>

Alot of the pictures made the school look very unkempt... Also there are multiple reports about asbestos and the school being closed... Did you see any evacuations except the 10 or somkids?  Where are the other 500 students..</p>

<p>A concerned citizen filed a FOIA  request for maintenance contracts and school lunch contracts and other basic stuff an open school would need.. he was ridiculed, denied and then they classified everything and made it virtually illegal to research the subject..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it was another false flag attack. the motive is not removing our guns, but setting up a police force of a.i. robotics.</p>

<p>in serious, the most curious part about this case, are the videos that are buried somewhere on the internet of the shooting. phone videos from people in the crowd show a shooter on ground level. it also shows the entire crowd being spotlighted by the stage lights. as soon as the shooting stops, the lights turn off. a patron asks an official to turn the lights on because people need help, “these people are all dead..who are you?” - “no they’re not, we have paramedics helping people right now we need lights”</p>

<p>very weird stuff that doesn’t add up. people absolutely died, and it’s being covered up.</p>

<p>my personal theory was that paddock was an arms dealer set up. perhaps a deal gone wrong or full on false flag. also note the building is owned by Israelis</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Counter theory:</p>

<p>The shooter was a gun nut who snapped and decided to shoot everyone up.  The right wing media, politicians, and police covered up his political leanings and hid details to help spread conspiracy theories so that no new gun laws would be passed.</p>

<p>I think the meta-conspiracy is much more compelling.  Gun sales increase, politicians get paid for blocking legislation, gun-voters entrench support for their officials, and the world keeps spinning.  And all they had to do was slow down an investigation and feed the right conspiracy theory with a few well-placed fake accounts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a great documentary I found very intriguing on Amazon Prime called “What Happens in Vegas” I believe, which focus is on the corrupt system that runs Las Vegas even before the shooting.  Further, because I’m not one easily fall or or to believe in conspiracy theories, I’ll always remember how I kept thinking how “convenient” a mass shooting was to law enforcement and the politics at the time, and if ever I was to believe such attack could or would be ever be staged, it was unfortunately this one.</p>

<p>With that said, I’m curious to know exactly how or why others believe this to be a “red flag” or whatever the term be, and what the government would and could have gotten out of staging such a tragedy?  Do you believe it was staged, and further do you detest people were actually harmed, and in the whole crisis actor conspiracy?  (Keep in mind, I witnessed the Boston Marathon Bombing and have waaaaay too many connections to the tragedy to believe it was at all staged or some type of conspiracy to instill Marshall law, because I assure you those who actually experienced it have a much difference view on the matter, so I don’t want to hear craziness that everything is staged by the government nor at all disrespect any and all victims of these tragedies.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks so much for your kind words and concern!  I couldn’t agree more, with how disrespectful it is to question the loss families suffer with such tragedies, and again, even more especially when you can personally refute all theories (in regards to the bombings).  I’m personally grateful to have had some distance from directly being effected, and fortunate to not have sustained any injuries, either physical or mental, however people I’ve known before and after the attack have unfortunately lost limbs, and I can absolutely guarantee that my best friend had to attend a very real funeral for one of the victims.
Probably the craziest is that another close friend of mine had actually been acquainted with, while going to high school, with the oldest brother involved in the bombing.  He had “changed” and unbeknownst at the time to any of us what that even really meant, had become radicalized during visits home years before the incident took place.  So again, I couldn’t agree more with how disrespectful the crisis actor accusations can be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m glad you escaped uninjured both physically and mentally. My heart goes out to everyone affected by the bombing and I can’t imagine how frustrating it is to hear people say it didn’t happen when you saw it happen, and know people injured and/or killed. 
That’s crazy about the bomber, I can relate a little but not on a large scale like that. A friend of my now ex husband was at our house, we smoked a blunt with him, I was probably 23. A few days later we hear him crying on the news and put the tv volume up, he claims (though the police think the violence was planned) that he went with his friend to rob the friends family. Well they somehow ended up attacking the family brutally with baseball bats, they killed the friends father, seriously injured the mother, almost killed the brother (he’s still recovering about 7 years later) the little sister was hiding, they looked for her for a minute and then the friend took off, our friend was dumb enough to stay in the house so he was In custody immediately, the friend was arrested the next day. They’re both in prison for life thankfully! 
It was really surreal to think that someone who had just been to my house and had been around my baby daughter was capable of such brutality. Really blew my mind and messed with my head, that my instincts had been so wrong, I thought he was weird but never thought he would be violent! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again thank you for your kind words, and understanding it’s exactly that- frustrating.  And how do you exactly “prove” something like that?!  Because although I agree and can’t blame people who question authority, and actually think it COULD make sense to someone looking from the outside that it was a convenient way for the government to enforce Marshall Law, and to have us shelter in place, but that really isn’t how it went down or happened.
Further I’m glad you yourself and most especially your daughter were also far enough removed from that situation to have endured any actual harm!  Again I can totally relate and have known some of the most unlikely people to do that craziest things!  Glad those guys are exactly where they belong, that is a terrible situation, and especially over money.  It really is very unsettling how little you can know, and just shows you how you never really can. (if you ever felt guilt about having them around your baby, you certainly shouldn’t).  As this mainly reminds me of the time I had dated a guy from Ireland, who was a complete gentleman and sincerely had me thinking he was the one who got away when he left, and secretly always clung to the hope that he’d come back and we’d end up happily ever after.  Well he did come back, and about two years ago our mutual friend we met through had run into him, and he was (once again, as he had shared the same enthusiasm about me once) madly in love with a girl he met, she had gotten pregnant, and so he was arranging to marry her, build a white picket fence, etc.  Not going to lie, sucked hearing, and always stung a bit.  Until the last I heard about him during the summer, again through our mutual friend.  But instead this time, Irish was now in prison for a felony, after beating the shit out of the girl, while she was pregnant!!!<br/>
I can’t help but think about the bullet I dodged, and further what I missed, it still doesn’t seem possible to me... (with ALL respect to that poor woman, as we’ve bonded so much over the shame in victim blaming and questioning them! haha)</p>

Historically speaking, these mass shootings have all been carried out by people in their teens or early twenties.  Safe to say they all shared some similar form of psychopathy that manifested at a relatively young age.  Almost all of them had childhood warning signs.  Stephen Paddock was 59 years old.  He allegedly went six decades without demonstrating any mental illness, then suddenly decided to carry out a very complicated terrorist attack for no apparent reason.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not correct. Even if someone was a bad person, that&#39;s not evidence they were simply born that way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Mental disorders don&#39;t really live ‘out there’ waiting to be explained. <em>They are constructs we have made up</em> - and often not very compelling ones.&quot;    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Frances">Allen Frances</a> in <em>“DSM in Philosophyland: Curiouser and Curiouser”</em> in AAP&amp;P Bulletin vol 17, No 2 of 2010   </p>

<p><strong>Gene &quot;link&quot; fallacies.</strong></p>

<p>All sorts of things can be linked to genes.</p>

<p><strong>eg:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>food tastes, </li>
<li>musical taste, </li>
<li>political beliefs, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t mean &quot;the genes cause them.&quot;  And it doesn&#39;t mean &quot;therefore it&#39;s a disease.&quot;</p>

<p>Similarly, some people allege they&#39;ve found a gene link to homosexuality: <a href="https://cosmosmagazine.com/biology/speculative-genetic-link-to-homosexuality-found">https://cosmosmagazine.com/biology/speculative-genetic-link-to-homosexuality-found</a></p>

<p>But even if that&#39;s true, that would <strong>not</strong> be evidence that the behavior is a disease.</p>

<p>Different != disease.</p>

<p>And it doesn&#39;t mean the genes <em>cause</em> the behavior, it could just be an irrelevant gene.  If you looked at a bunch of random people they wouldn&#39;t have completely average genes.</p>

<p>ie, you could take any accusations about their behavior and claim there&#39;s a &quot;genetic link&quot; between the behavior and the different genes.</p>

<p>Also, the idea of the &quot;psychopaths&quot; is that people are just born evl (empathyless) due to genes is essentially what the Nazis said about the jews.  That the jews were &quot;psychopaths&quot; in terms of being charming, empathyless, manipulative, &amp; so on.</p>

<p>But there is no evidence of this idea of &quot;genetic psychopathy.&quot;  Almost all behaviors can be linked to genes (eg political beliefs, poverty, crime, etc.)  But that doesn&#39;t mean genes <em>cause</em> them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have given me a lot of food for thought so I would like to probe your mind for a bit of information. Genes don&#39;t determine behavior but instead influences them, right? I am wondering if genes can inhibit certain behaviors from arising making them all but impossible if not highly improbable.   </p>

<p>It seems to me that certain people might be predispositioned to care less about others regardless of the environment they are placed in. I recall an expert (who was himself a psychopath) explaining differences revealed in MRI scans that point towards anti-social tendancies. He explained how he discovered that he was a psycopath by comparing his own scan to that of his subjects and found that his brain was structured similarly.   </p>

<p>I am only a layman and know very little about all of this but from what little I have gathered there seems to be a condition of the mind that does not allow for empathy.   </p>

<p>If such were the case would it not be appropriate to refer to it as a social disease? Or is that just playing the semantics and definition&#39;s game?</p>

<p>There&#39;s no evidence of that.  There&#39;s no &quot;empathyometer&quot; or units of empathy.  It&#39;s just a subjective insult that someone &quot;lacks empathy&quot; that state officials (war mongers, police who kill dogs, etc) never get accused of.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He explained how he discovered that he was a psycopath by comparing his own scan to that of his subjects and found that his brain was structured similarly. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Imagine in 1940s Germany started doing this- started brain scanning people &amp; saying &quot;if your brain is similar looking to a Jew.. a empathyless manipulative parasite... then you must be one too.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s silly:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It&#39;s assuming just looking like someone else proves you think the same way.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s assuming there&#39;s &quot;psychopaths&quot; in the first place.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, this guy thought he was totally fine &amp; a normal person.  With normal empathy &amp; so on.  Then he found he simply looked similar to someone accused of &quot;psychopathy&quot;.. So instead of admitting his work was based on irrational assumptions he declared himself a psychopath.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not logical.</p>

<p>That assumes there&#39;s &quot;psychopaths&quot; </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No he wasn&#39;t.  Having a similar brain scan to someone else (eg a murderer) doesn&#39;t prove you&#39;re some dangerous person who seeks to murder person.</p>

<p>The guy exposed his own work as quackery.  He thought he was totally fine </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some things aren&#39;t quantifiable but can still be shown to exist. You can&#39;t measure pain, autism, pleasure, scents, attention, intelligence but there is every reason to believe these things exist. There is nothing to suggest that there aren&#39;t individuals who lack all motivation (and therefore ability) to care about anybody beyond themselves, psychopathy like sociopathy are just terms to describe these differences.   </p>

<p>It is radically different to assert that empathyless individuals exist than it is to say that an entire group of people are without it. I can see the dangers of abusing the psychopath rhetoric but I don&#39;t see how that undermines or even relates to the existence of this condition.   </p>

<p>I am inclined to believe you but something is preventing me from being at ease with accepting what you are saying. You seem a bit quick to disregard the research - perhaps this is because you already know what you know - but i do not know so I am navigating my way through this trying to determine what makes sense.    </p>

<p>In the interview the man also reveals that his family always suspected him of being a psychopath but the MRI scan just confirmed it - leading me to believe in the validity of those scans as there is (seemingly) a very strong correlation between self-serving anti-social behaviours and how the brain is wired. I would call this evidence - but I am more than open to being informed further or at the very least pointed in the right direction so that I may see more perspectives on this matter.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying pain doesn&#39;t exist, I&#39;m saying if someone is in pain you can&#39;t just assume they were born that way.  You can&#39;t just declare it an illness.</p>

<p>eg lots of people who are not socially skilled exist, we can say &quot;autism exists as a label for behaviors.&quot;  But we can&#39;t act assume these are genetically inferior people who (if you follow that logic) shouldn&#39;t exist.  We don&#39;t need people studying the genes of less social people &amp; trying to &quot;cure&quot; future humans from having those genes.</p>

<p>Similarly, it&#39;s fine if &quot;psychopath&quot; is used just as a word for alleged behaviors (eg you think someone is a &quot;psychopath&quot; and they think you&#39;re a &quot;psychopath..&quot;)</p>

<p>But when people start assuming their empathy insults are science, and thus wanting to blame the genes of people they dislike, that&#39;s nothing but assumptions.  There&#39;s nothing scientific about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see what you are saying now more clearly. In the 60&#39;s the APA (largest and most respected group of psychologists in America) declared homosexuality to be a mental illness. Obviously, as gatekeepers to knowledge with a &#39;higher&#39; authority, this had severe repercussions which are still being felt today.   </p>

<p>In a similar vein the existence of autism is also disputed as there is a broad range of behaviours and conditions that may or may not apply. I see the linguistic benifit of referring to a wide array of people in one word but that does not really prove anything scientifically, as you say.   </p>

<p>It&#39;s sad to see the largest organisation in the US relating to autism spending most of their money on finding a &quot;cure&quot;, but I digress.  </p>

<p>I am not suggesting inferiority in atypical neurological minds or employing these words as &#39;empathy insults&#39;, but I know that you mean these things in a general sense.   </p>

<p>I feel that I will need to digest this some more, thank you for challenging my presumptions and heuristical thinking. Do you have a title I could get lost in relating to this? I see you have some books in your original comment, if I had to read one which would you recommend?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you’re saying but I feel the need to state that autism is so much more than not being social. My brother has aspergers which is high functioning autism, but even with being high functioning, he’s incapable of living on his own, granted there are aspergers/autistic people who are capable of living normal lives but there are a lot who aren’t as well, my brother is able to work at subway, but he can’t drive and can’t live alone. He’s highly intelligent but only about the things he cares about which at this point in his life is “films” (and don’t you dare call them movies around him), he throws temper tantrums that rival my toddler when things change in his life or he doesn’t get his way... many birthday dinners have been ruined because he couldn’t decide where he wanted to go, or once we are there what he wants to eat. He graduated high school with the help of aides but did not go in to college and has no desire to ever do more with his life than living at home with our mother and working at subway... I should mention he’s 27 years old. He picked up drinking for a while but seems much less interested in going to the bar lately. He even has some people he considered friends. He hates children to the point he’s never spoken a work to my 7 or 3 year old daughters even after we had to move back home ourselves for a period of time. 
I’m genuinely concerned about what hell do when our mother isn’t around anymore, she had him at 36 so she’s in her mid 60s and already having health problems that will make it difficult for her to continue paying the bills. </p>

<p>Autism isn’t just “being different”, yes there are high functioning autistic people who are capable to living normal lives and caring for themselves and others, but there’s plenty like my brother and many worse off than my brother, who can’t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m interested in what you&#39;re saying but I wonder what you think does qualify something as a disease then. If you say genes aren&#39;t associated with disease then there are a bunch of things people would ordinarily say are diseases that you&#39;re ruling out on technicality, like Cystic Fibrosis. If you are ruling out things that have behavioural consequences as a symptom, what about pituitary tumours, Alzheimers or the like?</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re right that mental illness is a &quot;construct we&#39;ve made up&quot;, but so is disease as a whole. That doesn&#39;t mean it has no utility in helping us understand the world.</p>

<p>A real disease (eg germs, cell damage, etc) isn&#39;t purely made up.</p>

<p>The language is made up.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s physical cell damage &amp; so on that scientists can study with physical tools.</p>

<p>In contrast, when you go to a psychiatrist they don&#39;t do a lab test.  They just fit you to a list of &quot;symptoms&quot; (misbehaviors they dislike) and then &quot;diagnose&quot; you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you say genes aren&#39;t associated with disease</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t say that at all.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m saying the state&#39;s moral views (ie which behaviors are good or bad) aren&#39;t evidence of any illness. </p>

YouTube stated that it had tweaked its search algorithm to promote news sources which it considered more authoritative. Some experts have stated that the removal of this content ironically fuels conspiracy theories by making a cover-up seem evident.</p>

<p>Survivors of the shooting have been accused of being paid actors, with some having received death threats on social media.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists claim that there were multiple shooters and that details of the massacre are being covered up for the sake of promoting gun control laws.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I’m open minded and I’ve looked at a lot of the conspiracy ideas and sources but this is where I’m stuck... why? I don’t believe “taking away the guns” because in all honesty very little has happened since the shooting in regards to that, trump mumbled something about banning bump stocks but that’s about it. If sandy hook didn’t do it, Vegas sure won’t either because yes it was more people but sandy hook was small children, I have two young daughters, one of which is in elementary school, and I WANT so badly to believe it was a hoax and no one was actually killed and that things like that don’t happen but even after looking at all the the “sources” on that as well, I just don’t buy it. 
There’s plenty of “conspiracies” I believe, like 9/11 but I just don’t buy these two at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really think there has to be a motive that &quot;normal&quot; people would understand. I do think the whole thing is really strange. The photos of the room don&#39;t seem to contain nearly enough shell casings. That guy shot at least 550 some bullets so there should have been photos of mounds of casings! The photo from his room that shows the window he shot out of only appears to contain a couple dozen. Plus the only photo they really show of him is that one where his eyes are closed and he has 13 tattooed on his neck, which is strange for an accountant. I don&#39;t see that tattoo on the photo where he&#39;s shot himself, but maybe his shirt is covering it. 
Strange stuff, that whole situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a fascinating exercise: Every major newsworthy event over the past 20 years has been the target of massive speculation regarding its potential to be a part of some vast conspiracy. Every mass killing is a false flag. Every crashed plane was downed by some shadowy agency. Some people even try to claim that natural disasters are a part of these conspiracies.</p>

<p>So... does <em>anything</em> bad ever happen that&#39;s NOT a grand conspiracy? It seems like we should expect some bad things to happen. There are violent people in the world. Some of them are not socially stable. We should expect that, logically, to result in some terrible events.</p>

<p>But it seems like conspiracy theory culture is asserting that this never happens. Why is that?</p>

<p>Go far enough down that rabbit hole, and you&#39;ll find a vast web of conspiracy... albeit an unintentional one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Makes perfect sense. Crazy people think crazy things. He turned the tv on, saw someone on CNN calling for gun control or someone talking about mass shootings. Mass shootings are a popular topic. All it could’ve took was one moment of thinking “I could do that lol” </p>

<p>That’s what happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks so much for your kind words and concern!  I couldn’t agree more, with how disrespectful it is to question the loss families suffer with such tragedies, and again, even more especially when you can personally refute all theories (in regards to the bombings).  I’m personally grateful to have had some distance from directly being effected, and fortunate to not have sustained any injuries, either physical or mental, however people I’ve known before and after the attack have unfortunately lost limbs, and I can absolutely guarantee that my best friend had to attend a very real funeral for one of the victims.
Probably the craziest is that another close friend of mine had actually been acquainted with, while going to high school, with the oldest brother involved in the bombing.  He had “changed” and unbeknownst at the time to any of us what that even really meant, had become radicalized during visits home years before the incident took place.  So again, I couldn’t agree more with how disrespectful the crisis actor accusations can be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again thank you for your kind words, and understanding it’s exactly that- frustrating.  And how do you exactly “prove” something like that?!  Because although I agree and can’t blame people who question authority, and actually think it COULD make sense to someone looking from the outside that it was a convenient way for the government to enforce Marshall Law, and to have us shelter in place, but that really isn’t how it went down or happened.
Further I’m glad you yourself and most especially your daughter were also far enough removed from that situation to have endured any actual harm!  Again I can totally relate and have known some of the most unlikely people to do that craziest things!  Glad those guys are exactly where they belong, that is a terrible situation, and especially over money.  It really is very unsettling how little you can know, and just shows you how you never really can. (if you ever felt guilt about having them around your baby, you certainly shouldn’t).  As this mainly reminds me of the time I had dated a guy from Ireland, who was a complete gentleman and sincerely had me thinking he was the one who got away when he left, and secretly always clung to the hope that he’d come back and we’d end up happily ever after.  Well he did come back, and about two years ago our mutual friend we met through had run into him, and he was (once again, as he had shared the same enthusiasm about me once) madly in love with a girl he met, she had gotten pregnant, and so he was arranging to marry her, build a white picket fence, etc.  Not going to lie, sucked hearing, and always stung a bit.  Until the last I heard about him during the summer, again through our mutual friend.  But instead this time, Irish was now in prison for a felony, after beating the shit out of the girl, while she was pregnant!!!<br/>
I can’t help but think about the bullet I dodged, and further what I missed, it still doesn’t seem possible to me... (with ALL respect to that poor woman, as we’ve bonded so much over the shame in victim blaming and questioning them! haha)</p>
