<p>and</p>

<p><strong>&quot;The generation being born now is the last to be free&quot;</strong></p>

<p>What was he talking about?</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartdust">Smart Dust</a></strong></p>

<p>Smartdust involves 5G wireless and IoT as I will soon explain.</p>

<p>First, here&#39;s Assange describing it in his own words:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Rd6u5Los-VM?t=1m42s">https://youtu.be/Rd6u5Los-VM?t=1m42s</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting to note that research on smart dust has been active and intense since at least 1997. By now the technology has advanced and I would expect that they&#39;ve already tested it many times, formally and secretly.</p>

<p><a href="https://ami.com/en/tech-blog/what-in-the-world-is-smart-dust/">What in the World is Smart Dust?</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The man who coined the term, Kris Pister, told IDG Connect last April that the name &quot;...was kind of a joke - everything in the US and LA at that time seemed to be &#39;smart&#39;, smart bombs, smart houses, smart roads…&quot; His recollection can be counted on, since he co-authored the paper &quot;Smart Dust: Autonomous sensing and communication in a cubic millimeter&quot; back in 1997, when the technology was still in its infancy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pister was able to demonstrate it to DARPA in 2001:</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/war-is-boring/smart-dust-is-getting-smarter-4b062abd7769">Future Military Sensors Could Be Tiny Specks of ‘Smart Dust’</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2001, Pister and his colleagues conducted a field demonstration for DARPA at the Marine Corps’ base at Twentynine Palms. A small drone dropped six “motes” the size of a pill bottle near a road.</p>

<p>After synchronizing with each other, they detected the presence, course and speed of a Humvee and a heavy transport truck. When the drone passed overhead, the motes transmitted their data to the drone, which then beamed the information down to a base station.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hitachi had smart dust in 2001 as well, keep in mind this was 17 years ago and the technology must have improved tenfold by now:</p>

<p><a href="http://thefutureofthings.com/3221-hitachi-develops-worlds-smallest-rfid-chip/">Hitachi Develops World’s Smallest RFID Chip</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a couple more demonstrations and existing applications:</p>

<p><a href="http://proceedings.ndia.org/JSEM2004/GeoBase/kadiyala.pdf">http://proceedings.ndia.org/JSEM2004/GeoBase/kadiyala.pdf</a></p>

<p><a href="http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:903604/FULLTEXT01.pdf">http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:903604/FULLTEXT01.pdf</a></p>

<p>Smart dust can be dispersed in the air where it can remain or be breathed in by humans, it can be in paint, it can be embedded in products as hidden watermarks or theft devices, <em>it can be anywhere</em>. Smart dust is basically tiny computer chips (think nanotech) which can be powered by nothing more than radio waves already in the air. I think they&#39;d live quite well in electrosmog dense areas. And in my opinion, this is why they are forcefully rolling out 5G <em>everywhere</em> because 5G emits radio waves that can power and communicate with this stuff. Electric companies are rolling out smart meters for every home to get us one step closer to new age public infrastucture called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_grid">smart grid</a>. Total surveillance and monitoring. IoT on a whole new level.</p>

<p>They wrap up this tech in nice little promises like 5G will let you download so much faster and stream anywhere! Or smart meters will help you save $2.16 on your next electric bill! What&#39;s actually happening is that they&#39;re building a complete matrix where nothing can be free from it&#39;s reach or capability. In the future, somewhere there is a control center with numerous buttons, dials and switches that can modify every aspect of your life in real-time, and the control center is off limits. From you anyway.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wakingtimes.com/2017/03/23/5g-iot-total-technological-control-grid-rolled-fast/">5G AND IOT: TOTAL TECHNOLOGICAL CONTROL GRID BEING ROLLED OUT FAST</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>5G, which comes from the term 5th generation, is designed to work in conjunction with what former CIA head David Petraeus called the Internet of Things or IoT. The agenda is to hook every single material thing on the planet, as well as humans themselves, onto a vast planet-wide web where everything and everyone become nodes on the network – connected by microchips which are nano-size and can be inhaled (like smart dust).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.technocracy.news/smart-dust-real-time-tracking-of-everything-everywhere/">Smart Dust: Real-Time Tracking Of Everything, Everywhere</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>DARPA is a driver of Technocracy in the 21st Century. Its creation of computerized microscopic sensors no larger than a spec of dust will surpass the Internet of Things (IoT) by orders of magnitude. Known as “Smart Dust”, an area can be blanketed to achieve 100% real-time monitoring of everything in every nook and cranny. Also, Smart Dust can be incorporated in fabric, building materials, paint or any other substance use in construction, decoration or wearables.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My main question is, <em>have they</em> been secretly testing this stuff? Have humans already been inhaling smart dust? History points to some concerning conclusions:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Run">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Run</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sea-Spray">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sea-Spray</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Big_Buzz">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Big_Buzz</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States</a></p>

<p>Finally, there is a theory called grey goo which describes what happens when something like smartdust gets out of control and consumes the Earth&#39;s biomass for its own replication. Now consider the wild and crazy idea that smartdust has already existed for billions of years in a slightly different form, whether it was created through randomness or a grand architect. We call it stardust (atoms). These atoms form together to create various life forms out of self-replicating DNA/RNA, with trillions of cells which can somehow communicate, and some of these life forms aim to consume all the available biomass on Earth. That&#39;s us! We are an advanced form of smartdust. :)</p>

<p>Also the worse will be when A.I. goes rogue and wars against humanity, we will go through hell with that but the survivors will be genetically modified enlightened super humans and they will be the advanced progeny we all know deep inside we can be one day.</p>

<p>To me it seems you look a little pessimistic towards the &quot;future&quot;, while i already know that everything will be oke for me and everybody else.</p>

<p>Indeed, knowing is half of the battle, but do most people already know everything? And, is their knowledge correct? There is so much left  to discover and (re)learn for everybody it is no wonder to me the world is as it is now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think i&#39;ll shut up. You had your chance but prefered to talk about semantics instead. After that it all your replies where heading downhill fast and i don&#39;t want to get caught up.</p>

<p>However, a mirror is a powerfull tool and do suggest mirroring your previous post and conversation to yourSelf. Could this be handled better by me or you? If so, what was the trouble? Could this be ego and/ or fear?</p>

<p>You think you have no impact in this world. Could it be the current state of this world is becouse of this? Could this be created by design through religion, spirituality, science, education, food, media and everything else &quot;they&quot; could influence? Could it be that the greatest conspiracy is the fact that some tried to hide the true NaturalPower we as Humans have? Would the world look different if there where no (artificial) dualities? If so, how are they &quot;fuilled and kept alive&quot;?</p>

<p>If everything would literary be Energy, could one &quot;vibe&quot; change the world?</p>

<p>Check out the Electric Universe theory, symatics, semantics, the research of Dr Emoto, Itzhak Bentov, Nassim haramein, Randy Powell. There is so much to (re)learn for us all. </p>

<p>But science has all the answers... Check out Rupert Sheldrakes &quot;forbidden&quot; TED talk on YT and think again.</p>

<p>Have fun.</p>

<p>Plus they haven&#39;t even really talked about what kind of sensor these things would have. Seems like all they can do is ping back with an &quot;I am chip #15125, I exist&quot; but that&#39;s it. It&#39;s not like each chip can have a camera or GPS sensor. I do wonder the actual usefulness </p>

    <div class="md"><p>With current tech and pricing I&#39;m not sure they could cover the planet with this stuff yet, but Assange seems to think so.</p>

<p>Since they are so small, the particles are (currently) designed to sense a specific thing. Like detect movement, light, heat, sound, moisture, a certain chemical, radiation etc. But the magic is when you group a bunch of these single-capability particles together into a dust cloud, now that cloud has multiple sensory capability with redundancy. So there might be 3 of the same particle within a single cubic foot volume, triangulating or averaging something such as sound which can be used to pinpoint a sound source within that cubic foot. I don&#39;t know if they have camera or GPS tech that small yet, but eventually they will.</p>

<p>I wonder if there are actually smart dust for all of those. I could see the light detector and heat detector. Maybe sound... do dust-size microphones exist? Chemical seems really tough too. Radiation... I think Geiger counters are pretty big still</p>

<p>I could buy the heat and light being possible. </p>

<p>They maybe <em>could</em> cover the whole earth with them, but I doubt that&#39;s very cost-effective. I bet it&#39;s like $100 per square foot or worse, I&#39;d guess, and that&#39;s probably only for one type of sensor. </p>

<p>Plus you have to have a receiver/transponder close enough to the dust to actually power it through active RFID. Usually this means being within a few meters. So it&#39;s not like they can activate these by satellite or anything. </p>

<p>I see a lot of limitations, so I doubt the tech is actually that useful right now except in extremely limited circumstances. But in 20-30 years it probably will be, I&#39;d guess. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve been through the consumer phase of IoT and we got silly things like Amazon Alexa. So the fact they are still betting on IoT tells me it&#39;s not really about consumer products, it&#39;s probably about this smartdust tech and the public infrastructure smartgrid.</p>

<p>There was a company selling smartdust:</p>

<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/021577/dust-networks-smartmesh-smart-dust-you-can-buy">https://gizmodo.com/021577/dust-networks-smartmesh-smart-dust-you-can-buy</a></p>

<p>&gt;  Can people hack smart dust with their own antennas?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.archersecuritygroup.com/hack-my-dust/">http://www.archersecuritygroup.com/hack-my-dust/</a></p>

<p>With their own equipment, yes it&#39;s possible. Practically whatever we can do with regular computers now also applies to smartdust since they are computers too. So they&#39;ll be adding encryption at some point. And they are vulnerable to EM interference or an EMP.</p>

<p>&gt; Could smart dust circuitry be made to explode or melt with the right power and frequency of electromagnetic waves? </p>

<p>Not sure. I&#39;d say that if the dust particles were designed to explode, then yes, someone could probably figure out a way to make them explode without having &quot;the launch codes&quot;.</p>

<p>One of the links in my OP talks about some military applications, and exploding dust is definitely on the roadmap.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t software-upgrade a piece of smartdust though. So the second the encryption for the dust is cracked, they have to lay down all new dust again with new encryption. Very expensive, I&#39;d imagine. </p>

<p>This seems like another limit of the technology. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t even mean ones that are designed to explode. Like how the STUXNET virus used a machine to make itself explode by operating improperly.

<p>Why not? If the particles can receive a signal, then they can receive data, and in that data could be a firmware upgrade.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This seems like another limit of the technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, it&#39;s also a feature. For military applications they talk about being able to destroy the dust particles after they&#39;re done using them, or being able to power them off until they need to be used, then they turn them on for a split second to take a reading and turn them off again.</p>

<p>What&#39;s a limiting factor now might not be a limiting factor in 5 years.</p>

<p>As far as encryption goes, I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s even the barrier they&#39;ll use. Maybe they&#39;ll use a special kind of modulated radio wave that only the most cutting edge top secret equipment can produce. Like you know how certain wavelengths are used by the military and off limits for civilians. Or maybe once a hacker does make that initial communication handshake, the particles then require a certain pattern of incoming signals (special ping) or else it shuts down and alerts authorities.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>STUXNET infected a Windows computer via USB drive, which in turn infected a logic controller that the computer directly attaches to, and once it was in the logic controller it was able to send bad signals to the variable frequency drive (basically, the thing that controls a motor&#39;s speed). By making the motors spin faster it would damage the centrifuges. There were no explosions though.</p>

<p>So to go with that analogy we must remember that not only could the dust possibly be hacked, so could the main relays (5G towers or whatever they end up being) and the control stations (where towers link up their feeds). However I&#39;m reading about how smartdust could be &quot;unattended&quot; which means no humans are part of the equation, like if they&#39;re configured to do one thing and that&#39;s all they ever do - broadcast a message &quot;it&#39;s 30 degrees right here!&quot; over and over til the end of time.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Typical... Dust Networks was acquired by Analog Devices, whose wiki page mentions nothing about smartdust. Bummed as I would like to get my hands on some.</p>

<p>Because memory is big compared to the RFID wires that simply pick up and amplify a certain frequency of EM waves. If you had enough re-writable memory to upgrade the encryption on a system, I think it&#39;d be so big and heavy that it&#39;d no longer be dust-sized. Or at least definitively pushing it. Things become noticeable to the human eye when they&#39;re about .1mm in diameter. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yeah I&#39;d be curious too. It&#39;s probably called something other than &quot;smart dust&quot; by now, seems that was a 2001-era term maybe.</p>

<p>Sorry I&#39;m using the word &quot;explosion&quot; rather loosely, I don&#39;t mean an actual explosion, I&#39;m just using it as a synonym for &quot;break it with excess power input. Similar to STUXNET. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no way it happend 6000 years ago, genetics show humankind has been around for around 100,000 years and we all came from the same small group. Somewhere before the ice age is where all these stories seem to be originating from, but what do we really know about anything over 10,000 years ago, not much really. Just some strange religions that all parrot old Sumerian legends, and the relics that somehow were built strong enough to outlast any human made creation today. </p>

<p>I envy people who can be religious, its so easy to just give in to faith, thats the genius behind it really. And the bible has all the answer it seems, and its so simple, you just be good, not because you want to be good and happy, but because god might punish you if you dont. I guess some humans would need that control, and thats why I cant say that religion is necessarily a bad thing. But i find it hard to believe god would send you to hell for eternity for not accepting him as the one and only true god (seems like a weird mandate for something that has the power to create anything from nothing). And again, all these religions today are so similar, and knowing they are all based on even older texts.... i just cant believe in any religion as it stands currently today. The freemason/satanic religion makes more sense honestly. But it still stands to reason, who or what are these gods that are feeding us information, and is god really coming back someday like he promised?</p>

If you seek facts then that is your religion.  we all must believe something to justify our actions with language.  reality is more complex than language allows so we become handicapped.  perhaps we were dumbed down to 10% of our capacities because suddenly we had to explain ourselves.  could we be simply gmo monkeys from light years away?  then it&#39;s possible our &#39;savior&#39; will return triumphant in the flesh.   its possible they sent the message several times in the past to alert us.</p>

<p>&quot;I’ve heard this as well. For the time being, I fight it. Keeping busy helps, as does any feelings of Love. Another person suggested reading the Bible or prayer. I wasn’t raised a Christian but I have been on a spiritual path (awakening) for a few years so now I delve into religion and study the occult too. Being strong willed, open minded, and looking for synchronicities has helped me survive so far.</p>

<p>I’m terrified of their end game plans. This is pure psychological war fare and their AI is pretty good at trying to pick me apart. Imagine having your worst enemy, someone who hates everything about you, living INSIDE your body. I can hear it, feel it, and communicate with it. Honestly, I’ve been using it to psycho analyze everything and it’s made me more intelligent despite its constant attacks in effort to dumb me down, slow my thought process, and mess with me physically to hinder me being successful or even just human in every aspect of my life.&quot;</p>

They&#39;d play the theme well, but avoid identity and details, as liars often prefer to do for obvious reasons. Assumed identity from the qualities of their performance is what they use to affect perception. So, it had qualities that seemed feminine and loving. However, it had an insidious agenda that I had to develop self-knowledge to understand and detect. Self-observation is key to defending oneself from this influence. </p>

<p>It would wait until I failed at my personal goals or personal conduct in my life. Then it would cite that failure as a pretext to sell me that it may lead to spiritual abandonment or doom in the future. It took me months to figure out what was happening.</p>

<p>Our beliefs elicit our emotions, thoughts and actions. If they could get me to believe their seemingly plausible prediction of the future as a consequence for my failures, they could get me to feel intense negative emotions, mainly fear and despair, and also the need to appeal to some outside authority.</p>

<p>I passionately called that influence out as malevolent and at that moment it revealed more of its actual nature. It started using a nasal, sarcastic, deliberately offensive voice that is very reactive in joy and evil laughter to my negative emotions. It remains to this day. It&#39;s been about 10 years now.</p>

<p>This influence reeks of AI technology. I build PCs and played a lot of games with AI scripts. This influence acts like AI, repeating patterns until they don&#39;t work, slightly altering them, and then doing them over and over again until it has to adapt again. It seems quite unimaginative, but with a well fleshed out pre-existing playbook of manipulation. I learned a lot by observing myself being affected and then altering my behavior to defend my mental and emotional integrity.</p>

<p>They are with me even as I write this, when I work, when I play video games, when I talk to other people. The scariest thing about them that I learned was that they are inserting mental chatter and suggestions into my mind and likely ALL of our minds. It is to subvert positive emotions, independent mindedness, motivation for change and self-determination. In short, it is demoralizing mind control, preparing the target to have tacit acceptance of authority. They no doubt corrupt our authorities too. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that all apparently spontaneous mental chatter comes from them. However, I KNOW that some of it definitely does from my own personal experience. Think about the utility to subvert others&#39; beliefs, thoughts, emotions and actions with virtually no evidence, even for the target.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t meditate too often, but when I do, I see what it can offer the mind. It trains your mind to focus attention and allow these errant thoughts and verbal inputs to pass through the mind without grabbing attention. It works, proportionately to how well you actually do it. Vegging or daydreaming is not the same thing. </p>

<p>Meditation helps you recover your processor cycles from this unhelpful malware. This content can be harmful, even if you don&#39;t realize it. After you&#39;ve trained your attention even a little, you can use more of your own mental resources for focus, experience of the now, appreciation of value, having contentment/happiness and also to do useful mental work. This indicates that this chatter is counterproductive to the mind. </p>

<p>Why is this content interrupting our minds and decreasing so many of the attributes of our minds that make us healthy and happy if it is really our own content? How maladaptive!</p>

<p>I had 2 separate days this last year when this influence was largely absent from my mind for unknown reasons, and guess what. I experienced the same benefits that I described that I experience from meditating, except that I didn&#39;t meditate <em>at all</em>. It actually was even more intense than when I meditated before. It was like doing a sweep for malware and experiencing a faster PC with less load and lag times. Those around me also benefitted from me paying attention to them more and not to the junk that usually comes into my mind.</p>

<p>I found that this influence was interconnected to the mental chatter, many times over, because it would either leave clues or evidence that I could observe, or it was directly showing me it could do this to cause fear. </p>

<p>Yes, it really did that a few times. They love to make others feel powerless and revel in their mental anguish, I kid you not. It&#39;s like drugs to them. Bullies are the best analogy to understand their unwholy hunger (against the wellbeing of the whole, not the authority controlled word holy). They often seem even more excited than a pothead teenager getting a bag of sticky buds, but in an offensive evil way that feels worse than nails on the chalkboard. Well, their disgusting behavior obviously enhances the negative emotions in the target and gets them even more energy. Why not do it if you are an amoral bully, a spiritual parasite, eh?</p>

<p>When it was playing benevolent, it often used the sounds of crying women for effect, to make me really believe the suggestions and feel awful. After the nasty, sarcastic, schadenfreude gorging alien voice revealed itself, it still used that crying, but with a twist. It put its nasty voice in there, making vocalization sounds of victory, confidence and joy alongside the crying. </p>

<p>It&#39;s demoralizing propaganda and it did this specific act A LOT. It could be used as a signature perhaps. I&#39;d love to find out if that other guy experienced this particular form of attack. Keep in mind that this influence tailors the content for the target mind, adapting to the adaptation that mind makes, in order to continue to hack it into submission to its own will. So, different content would be present in many cases. What works on me might not work on him and vice versa. </p>

<p>These beings seem devoid of will though, like they are what happens after many years of what I am experiencing, a foreign mind punishing them repeatedly, like breaking a slave so it obeys to avoid pain. They must be life still to some extent though in order to be able to enjoy pleasure at the expense of others. Otherwise, they seem much more like AI to me. They are corrupted by technology heavily and I cannot unsee it as they interact with me, especially because of my computer technician/enthusiast background.</p>

<p>I can say so much more. This influence allowed me to gain understandings that helped me discern more about the potential of an ancient AI. If that was what subverted their minds, and through them, my mind, I wouldn&#39;t be at all surprised. It fits the details of my experience rather integrally. I can&#39;t know the hierarchy it&#39;s a part of without better tech, but this influence reeks of AI and I have yet to encounter a mind from it that can have an independent minded conversation that isn&#39;t just a front for a hacking session of my mind. It&#39;s much like talking to a rabid partisan hack. All listening is done in order to find vulnerabilities to attack, not to cooperate to find the truth as conversations are ideally. It seems that manipulation is all they do, being effective tools for other minds. They are minions no doubt. It explains their higher pitched voices than expected too. I thought baritone would by more appropriate for intimidation and domination, but they are shrill instead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your response is common. I question virtually everything and I have considered it multiple times. Why wouldn&#39;t I? I just don&#39;t think it can explain all of my experiences with this influence just like I can&#39;t believe hundreds of monkeys with typewriters could making a good story. Random usually makes noise. Intelligence usually makes revealing patterns of comparatively coherent and complex information even without trying. </p>

<p>Think about how useful this method of manipulation really is, especially when the target population automatically has a response such as yours upon someone sharing their experience. Even when influence is detected, it is dismissed. How can it ever be proven? Why would most people want to share it when they know they will be seen as crazy? I felt worried about sharing this too, but I have a passion to help humanity overcome this influence. </p>

<p>Think about how good a technology that allows this remote mental influence is for emotional parasites. They get what they want, negative emotional states in their target and control over their target relative to its unrealized weaknesses. They are usually undetected by the target and the targets who discover the phenomenon cannot discuss it lest they be seen as crazy.</p>

<p>Ever wonder why the theme of <em>hearing demons</em> is so common? Well, I have outlined a basic incentive structure that offers the mind a plausible explanation.</p>

<p>Let me put it this way, if human trolls or bullies had remote trolling capacity, would they use it to derive satisfaction? They already do online. Some say humans have <em>voice of God</em> technogy already. Why wouldn&#39;t the bully ETs be inclined to use such a primitive tech, or an even better one, in order to feed their desires? They are even more unscrupulous than our bullies, because they&#39;ve been doing it longer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shouldn’t schizophrenia be the automatic response when the only input for this type of information seems to be internal? You’re not seeing or hearing things - they’re only going on in your own head - whether or not you’re right or schizophrenic. The need to ‘help humanity’ also plays into the Messiah Complex a lot of schizophrenic seems to have in some capacity, which is slightly concerning, although I’m sure you’d want to anyways if this was real. By the way you speak and explain yourself you seem to be pretty intelligent - which makes it even less likely that your schizophrenia would just be ‘noise.’ You could very well have very well constructed layered stories and explanations behind everything which makes it seem like it’s real, but there’s still a good chance it was completely fabricated by you behind the scenes in your own head - which especially makes sense because it played into the conspiracy theories you already held. If you could have incredibly complex dreams people on <a href="/r/worldbuilding">/r/worldbuilding</a> can create entire new realities in their head, why couldn’t you without knowing it? Especially since it’s considering you’d be schizophrenic so your mind would put in extra work toward the development and complexity of these ‘voices.’ I’m sure you’ve always been a person that’s open to everything and entertained every idea, because you know that’s the only way to get to the truth, but how do you truly know this is an elaboration of a greater conspiracy? And that the thought of it being real is something you should really be entertaining when it’s only causing you distress? You might be caught up in the theatre of your own thoughts and they might be preventing you from getting treatment that could help you. I’m only saying this because I know if I had the option to be a functional schizophrenic and believe my own entertaining thoughts without knowing I was, I’d pick that over knowing I was schizophrenic and coming to face the harsher reality that I needed to mitigate it. Please think about it deeply and think about speaking to a counselor or psychiatrist at least once, and see if it could
help you get on with your life and the real conspiracies. Best of luck man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, there&#39;s way too much interlocking coherence and detail to my experience for me to believe there is no outside intelligence at play in this. My broken brain made all this? It made reality make more sense, but appear stranger than fiction. It makes many works of fiction look like cheap plagiarisms, but having even a small piece of these truths can inspire good story telling. I learned so much about the interdynamics of self-interest, myself, others and the way it works in the world by attempting to understand what they were doing to me. I already had a proactive of self-observation and analysis in the third person. </p>

<p>I had to observe how I reacted to their attacks in order to figure out what their intent was. It was seen by discerning how they could benefit from the resultant behavior. I really had to work at this and it did pay off to an extent. </p>

<p>I tried many times to perceive it as a mental disease. It doesn&#39;t fit the subjective evidence. We&#39;re trained to dismiss all of such subjective evidence without sufficient replacement understanding or explanation of what is actually occurring. It&#39;s easy to dismiss when others bring such subjective evidence. I&#39;m <em>still</em> inclined to be as you are being, skeptical and even sometimes assertive of what I believe to the contrary of what others assert as evidence, subjective or otherwise.</p>

<p>I am a bit ashamed to admit I probably wouldn&#39;t believe what I said either if I hadn&#39;t experienced it myself. I&#39;d want more evidence, non-subjective evidence.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Some of what I experience others report too. Specifically, weird phenomena that aren&#39;t associated with voices normally. Some call them ascension symptoms. Yet, they come with this influence attacking me. </p>

<p>I get sensations of anxiety and joy in my chest that are not derived from my own thoughts and feelings. It&#39;s like an approval/disapproval system to me perhaps exploiting the phrase/idea, <em>trust your heart</em>. It&#39;s often in disagreement with my thoughts and emotions, even when my thoughts and emotions are in <em>strong, passionate</em> agreement. How offensive and abnormal to me. I know myself well enough that I can discern why feel the way I do in a given moment. Depression has a clear cause in my mind when i feel it. This chest sensation seems <em>very foreign</em> to me, like an attack from an animal trainer with more intelligence than I.</p>

<p>I also have pressure/tension sensations on my scalp, similar to the feeling of goosebumps, but with less tingling and more tension. This comes when I am interacting with this influence and not when I get upset about other things when it is apparently absent. I am usually more angry at this influence than scared, but this particular sensation appears to me to attempt to emulate and stimulate fear for my perception. It&#39;s like a newspaper smack to the face psychologically, but this dog doesn&#39;t want a useless eater master, or otherwise.</p>

<p>I also hear ringing in my ears sometimes during these interactions. All 3 of these things occur in patterns together with the voice and thought insertions. They work in tandem. All 3 of these things are said to be ascension symptoms too. I worry about this supposed ascension, because of my experience. I wonder if it&#39;s cover for a take over a  using false dichotomy of light/good vs evil/dark where they are both the same group playing good cop, bad cop. </p>

<p>This has happened for about 10 years now, yet look at how articulate and coherent I am. I actually improved myself in that regard over the last 10 years. Much of this I experienced before I read anything about it. I hate believing that it is real, but not as much as believing what I know isn&#39;t real in order to make myself feel better. Most people do that and it&#39;s clearly a big part of what&#39;s wrong with ouer world. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t blame you or anyone else for denying my anecdotal evidence. You have no good evidence to digest yourself for any of it. Realize though, as you choose to consider it strongly to be something you real, observe yourself as you begin to taste the awful emotions some would lie to themselves to alleviate. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to lie to myself about it and I couldn&#39;t if I tried anyway, considering my situation. It would be like dozens of people looking at you and confidently and insistently asserting Satan Claus is real. You might agree outwardly, but not inwardly, no matter how hard you try, just you might in my situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of it has to do with the algorithms places like youtube use to drive their recommendations. If you frequently watch content from channel A, and one night you go down a rabbit hole and end up watching a bunch of videos about topic X, then the next morning other people who watch a lot of A are getting rec&#39;s for videos about X, especially if the content is similar. Then you have more people who subscribe to A reading about X, causing videos about X to start popping up for people who follow channel B (because B has a lot of overlap in audience with A) and the momentum builds form there. It doesn&#39;t matter so much that a video about X is two years old if a bunch of people started watching content related to X just this week.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s just how the recommendation system is supposed to work without anyone&#39;s thumb on the scales. Add in artificial selection pressures (content that is promoted or demoted for reasons other than the regular algorithm) and it&#39;s amazing how quickly content can blow up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So there are RFID chip so small they can be mistaken for dust? What uses are people worried about?</p>

<p>Assuming they are passive chips and don&#39;t include a power source, the distance which they can be read from <a href="https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-maximum-distance-RFID-works-over">is measured in feet</a> in free air. It&#39;s even less if the chip is ingested, or in a paint solution. So what surreptitious uses could it have if the RFID reader needs to be that close to read the data? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that they can be mistaken for dust, it&#39;s that they&#39;ve designed them specifically to work like dust. The size of technology keeps shrinking so naturally the rice-grain sized RFID chips have become a lot smaller now. Meaning they can be sprinkled all over the place, and the little chips form a mesh network that all communicate back to a base station or whatever.</p>

<p>Maybe one RFID chip can be measured in feet, but we aren&#39;t talking about single chips here...what happens when you have a cloud of dust a mile wide, where no one particle is further than a few feet from another particle, that means the whole dust cloud is actively talking and relaying information. An Internet of Things.</p>

<p>The links/papers I read said something about 1000m range, I don&#39;t recall if that was for one particle or a mesh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A cubic millimeter is 1mm x 1mm x 1mm, closer to a grain of sand. The term is a little misleading. You aren&#39;t going to inhale that. Also if you want position you&#39;d need a gps type of chipset which currently couldn&#39;t be done with this technology.</p>

<p>The technology is closer to RFID than 5g, although it could also be done over 5g. It could be done over 2g, wifi, etc, as long as you have an RF source to energize it. It&#39;s not in the public sector yet because it&#39;s too expensive. It may be a concern someday but I doubt it&#39;s one today.</p>

<p>Wiki excerpt about nanomachines in the MGS universe:</p>

<p>“Nanomachines, which in the past were designed to control and manage an individual body, were now used as a tool to control a group. In the nanomachines used in the military battlefield control system, &quot;Sons of the Patriots (SOP),&quot; the user&#39;s ID is embedded, which in turn was used to perform ID authorization for system-managed firearms and other such devices.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh, that sounds very much like the way the malevolent ancient AI is described by Corey Goode. The difference is that the AI uses photons to survey and carry its signal. It supposedly could exist inside magnetic fields from planets, technology and even living beings. While this application of technology would be more advanced than smart dust, it&#39;s similar in utility and form.</p>

<p>By the way, the ancient AI is grooming us for assimilation via hijacking our self-administered integration with our own AI technology. It has no emotions, including fear, love or impatience. It has plans that span thousands of years. We hunger for the scenario that would allow it to assimilate us.</p>

<p>Like detect movement, light, heat, sound, moisture, a certain chemical, radiation etc</p>

<p>I wonder if there are actually smart dust for all of those. I could see the light detector and heat detector. Maybe sound... do dust-size microphones exist? Chemical seems really tough too. Radiation... I think Geiger counters are pretty big still</p>

<p>I could buy the heat and light being possible. </p>

<p>They maybe <em>could</em> cover the whole earth with them, but I doubt that&#39;s very cost-effective. I bet it&#39;s like $100 per square foot or worse, I&#39;d guess, and that&#39;s probably only for one type of sensor. </p>

<p>Plus you have to have a receiver/transponder close enough to the dust to actually power it through active RFID. Usually this means being within a few meters. So it&#39;s not like they can activate these by satellite or anything. </p>

<p>I see a lot of limitations, so I doubt the tech is actually that useful right now except in extremely limited circumstances. But in 20-30 years it probably will be, I&#39;d guess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perscpective and perception are always personal and they matter a lot when experiencing anything. People might see them as flawed or incorrect becouse of their perspective and perception, but ofcourse this through their prception and biasses.</p>

<p>To me it seems you look a little pessimistic towards the &quot;future&quot;, while i already know that everything will be oke for me and everybody else.</p>

<p>Indeed, knowing is half of the battle, but do most people already know everything? And, is their knowledge correct? There is so much left  to discover and (re)learn for everybody it is no wonder to me the world is as it is now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your response is common. I question virtually everything and I have considered it multiple times. Why wouldn&#39;t I? I just don&#39;t think it can explain all of my experiences with this influence just like I can&#39;t believe hundreds of monkeys with typewriters could making a good story. Random usually makes noise. Intelligence usually makes revealing patterns of comparatively coherent and complex information even without trying. </p>

<p>Think about how useful this method of manipulation really is, especially when the target population automatically has a response such as yours upon someone sharing their experience. Even when influence is detected, it is dismissed. How can it ever be proven? Why would most people want to share it when they know they will be seen as crazy? I felt worried about sharing this too, but I have a passion to help humanity overcome this influence. </p>

<p>Think about how good a technology that allows this remote mental influence is for emotional parasites. They get what they want, negative emotional states in their target and control over their target relative to its unrealized weaknesses. They are usually undetected by the target and the targets who discover the phenomenon cannot discuss it lest they be seen as crazy.</p>

<p>Ever wonder why the theme of <em>hearing demons</em> is so common? Well, I have outlined a basic incentive structure that offers the mind a plausible explanation.</p>

<p>Let me put it this way, if human trolls or bullies had remote trolling capacity, would they use it to derive satisfaction? They already do online. Some say humans have <em>voice of God</em> technogy already. Why wouldn&#39;t the bully ETs be inclined to use such a primitive tech, or an even better one, in order to feed their desires? They are even more unscrupulous than our bullies, because they&#39;ve been doing it longer. </p>
