        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why is the media not reporting the fact only one window was broken not two? Who were the 3 women in the room with him? Why is his girlfriend Mary Lou not in jail despite her fingerprints being on the ammo and seemingly having foreknowledge? Why was his brother charged with child porn right after the event then charges dropped recently? 
Why were the two officers? Swat? giving orders inside the room not mentioned anywhere in the final report? They had on different tactical uniforms, had weapons with silencers and bipods, they were in charge yet left out of the report.
They have been identified via the one bodycam out of 8 running inside the room. Why were 7 of the first 8 officers inside the room not using their bodycams on their uniform? Did Paddock kill himself or did they shoot him? We don&#39;t know the LVMPD has given us both explanations. We would know if all of them had not intentionally had their cameras off. Why were the two men in charge in the room left out of the 60 minutes interview? 
Why did the LVMPD wait on the floor below Paddock for over 30 minutes until after he was finished shooting? What happened to Jesus Campos the hero security guard? Why did he limp during the Ellen interview yet was walking around fine on bodycam after allegedly being shot in the leg? What is he so terrified of? 
Why has the LVMPD lied about the other shooters up and down the Vegas strip? There are over 200 911 calls about other shooters at other hotels that go until 2am? Why was the shooter at the airport not discussed despite the audio of air traffic control discussing it? Who were in the 7 helicopters hovering over and around the concert during the shooting? Why did dozens of people say people were shooting at them from helicopters? Why are they scared to talk about it anymore? 
Why is Paddocks real work history not discussed. He worked for defense contractors, was not broke, was a pilot, frequently went to the Philippines etc? 
Why are the photos of the room &quot;leaked&quot; different from the Bodycam? Why is the broken glass and shell casings beside the unbroken window not there in the video but there in the pictures? 
Why did Paddock have 10x the amount of guns used? Why did he have explosives in his van? 
Why did Sherriff Lombardo say there had to be more people involved then suddenly call it a conspiracy a day later? 
Why did Sherriff Lombardo intentionally lie about Paddocks check in date then ban the reporters who corrected him? 
Who was the lady who warned people at the concert they were going to die and then was removed? Why did those witnesses who left suddenly stop talking to researchers? And delete their Facebook pages? Why did the FBI tell them to not talk to people about the lady who warned them? 
Why does the gun control movement never touch the Vegas incident despite it being the worst ever? 
Why did Sherriff Lombardo fight in court to keep all evidence secret? 
Why did officers inside the room right after breach state &quot;he has been 419 A WHILE&quot; meaning Paddock has been dead a while? I thought he charged you then killed himself minutes earlier? 
Where are the hundreds of bullet holes he allegedly fired at Jesus Campos? They aren&#39;t visible in the hall? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in Vegas and when the shootings started I downloaded a police scanner app and instantly tuned in the entire night. There was like 4 casinos they repeatedly said &quot;Confirmed shots.&quot; People kept telling me I heard wrong, but they clearly said &quot;Suspected shots at ....&quot; And &quot;Confirmed shots at....&quot; In the radio they kept saying &quot;We&#39;re on the floor.&quot; For at least an hour before we heard &quot;Suspect down.&quot; I could hear gun fire on the scanners the whole time but even on the radio they never said how he died.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to say that was tough to read with no spacing.</p>

<p>Nothing about the entire Vegas thing adds up, nothing.  </p>

<p>For me the things that stick out are that even though several people trained their cameras on the hotel where gun shots were supposed to be coming from there is literally no flash from a hot rapid fire high powered rifle.  You can say &quot;flash suppressor&quot; all you want but I don&#39;t believe they actually get rid of the flash.</p>

<p>Also, there are videos of A) a woman standing in the field where supposedly people are being mowed down with bullets saying that she doesn&#39;t see anything actually happening and nobody getting hit.  and B) a guy that is at the concert while there is &quot;gunfire&quot; saying that it is not real gunfire and that it is coming from the loudspeakers.  </p>

<p>With all of the cell phone cameras there I&#39;ve never seen a single bullet hit anything or anyone.</p>

<p>Video at the emergency room where there isn&#39;t that much commotion and no injuries.</p>

Debbie Lusignan, the Sane Progressive video blogger and former nurse for 15 years, did a full synopsis of all the video evidence and concludes that all medical activity was staged and the shootings weren&#39;t real.

    <div class="md"><p>JFK- entry is the exit wound. Those bullets are meant to yaw. They do strange things to targets. JFK&#39;s wound was a high powered rifle I believe some sort of .260. The 556 or 223 (nearly the exact same thing) is an intermediate cartridge that was created to create hydrostatic disruption with no expansion. Laws of war forbid hollow points, so the yaw is a back door towards this kind of effect but without getting to much detail this round was designed to wound not &quot;one shot stop someone&quot;. Imagine shooting a marble (.260) rifle at a target versus shooting a ball bearing (.223/556) at a target. High velocity yes, high powered no. If the &quot;shooter&quot; Mr. Paddock used a high powered rifle like a .260 or a more commonly used .308/ 7.62x51 it would have been a lot lot worse. Your talking the difference between getting shot in the leg and breaking a bone and getting shot in the leg and your leg being completely severed off. I forget my point but thankfully he used a intermediate cartridge and if this gets down voted I will remove it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This youtuber, &quot;John E Hoover&quot; aka #Iamjohncullen, aka the vacuum cleaner, is a known clown in the youtube vegas shooting community - mostly for his unfortunate presentation of the &quot;helicopter theory&quot;. 
Personally, I have little faith in anything his produces. I find his editing of video evidence takes too many liberties, and his assertions of evidence for whatever hypothesis he&#39;s hashtagging is, at best, heavy handed speculation...it&#39;s like rhetorical torture.</p>

<p>Nothing beats sitting down and watching the hours of bodycam footage, or listening to the released 911 calls, or reading the witness statements <strong>without</strong> editorial intervention. </p>

<p>That said, there exist a few very good commenters and documentalists in the youtube vegas shooting community, many of whom have unfortunately slowed their posting schedules since the release of the LVMPD report which stated no known motive. Everyone seems be waiting for the FBI report, which, if I recall correctly, was touted to be released before Oct. 1...what happened to that, anyway?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not passing judgement on the helicopter theory...or I should say hypothesis. I&#39;m passing judgement on <strong>Hoover&#39;s presentation</strong> of the hypothesis, which is so bad as to be laughable, thereby doing the exact opposite of what is supposedly intended, that is, the idea that helicopters were involved becomes <strong>less</strong> believable. On the other hand, there is solid, evidence-based discussion being done about the opening and closing of Paddock&#39;s hotel room doors and its potential for disproving the lone wolf narrative. Interesting how easy it is to overlook such work in light of such sexy helicopter videos. <strong>JOE LOMBARDO, RE-OPEN THE CASE!</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, equating flat earthers to people questioning a very shady LV shooting is disingenuous at best, the internet is here for many reasons and one of them is to interact with people, currently you&#39;re in a sub dedicated to conspiracies directing another person to accept a bullshit narrative or lack thereof. If you&#39;re honestly willing to just accept these things at face value then that&#39;s fine but don&#39;t expect others to blindly do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My opinion is it seems disgraceful to assume that the work of hundreds law enforcement personnel, who worked hard to make sense of this tragedy, would help cover up such a thing.  Of the thousands of witnesses of the shooting and the hundreds of videos, don’t you think someone would have captured these extra participants who helped pull off this shooting?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is disgraceful is letting yourself be spoon-fed bullshit and accepting it without question and for some reason you&#39;re assuming I&#39;m calling this event a false flag or something? I merely told you that people are here to question things, whatever conclusion your or I arrive at should be after some research however in a situation like this it&#39;s difficult to research since there&#39;s a large chunk of information that just isn&#39;t available and a majority of the questions posed in OPs example most likely cannot even be answered but they are interesting questions nonetheless. Twice now you&#39;ve assume that I&#39;m peddling some sort of narrative when in fact I haven&#39;t even mentioned my opinion on this topic only that it&#39;s asinine to not question the mainstream narrative, if in fact you do some research and the mainstream narrative is the most plausible then awesome but I&#39;m not about to just roll over without doing my due diligence, if you are then good luck to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone seen the video that was uploaded a couple months ago of security footage from I think a hotel looking down on the concert? It was like 2 hours long, the shooting starts a few minutes in and looks pretty graphic. You can even see people drop to the ground HARD from getting shot.</p>

<p>At work now but I&#39;ll try to link it later. Can&#39;t guarantee it&#39;ll still be on YouTube because it was pretty graphic at times, and I hear they&#39;ve been scrubbing all conspiracy related content lately. The reason I bring this video up is because during the chaos the camera moves and starts following a man running across the roof of a building (the Mandalay?) the guy doesn&#39;t look like he&#39;s in law enforcment gear and I really don&#39;t know if it&#39;s Paddock either. Anyone else seen this video?</p>

I live in Las Vegas and work on the strip and was at the MGM that night. Two of my lady friemds from high school were there that night and lost aomeone close to them and have been fucked up ever since.
