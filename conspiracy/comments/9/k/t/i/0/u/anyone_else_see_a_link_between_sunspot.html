Supposedly because of &quot;child porn&quot;. </p>

<p>Since WHEN does anyone force evacuations over digital crimes?  I thought they were acting like a quiet, rural solar observatory was some kind of nerve agent factory.  Especially since they evacuated the post office.  But nothing&#39;s happened for a couple weeks so I said well, NM.</p>

<p>Today Ricin is found in mail at <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna915891">the Pentagon</a> and Ted Cruz&#39; office where <a href="https://www.rawstory.com/2018/10/ted-cruzs-campaign-office-evacuated-white-powder-found-two-hospitalized/">2 people have been sent to the hospital.</a>.</p>

<p>I say the ricin came from Sunspot, or was made by a Sunspot worker.</p>

<p>That&#39;s certainly a puzzle.  Two weeks lag could mean that the perp already had some offsite, ready to go.</p>

<p>Or they could have sent it Media Mail.  THAT would take 2-3 weeks.  Remember that &quot;Media Mail Keeps the Snail in Snail Mail!&quot;<sup>®.</sup>  There is literally no slower way to send.  I often wonder if they just let it pile up and move it periodically.  It can take a month to go from one end of a state to the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is interesting. Nice correlation for this Reddit page. </p>

<p>- It was shutdown/evacuated for ten days on September 6th. </p>

<p>- They could have shut down the other observatories to distract us into thinking aliens, etc. but in reality they were doing something else. yes. </p>

<p>- Maybe they caught a guy who was making ricin and collected him and his work for later use</p>

<p>- And they picked this FBI investigating Kavanaugh week (&quot;limited scope&quot;) to release their collection </p>

<p>- Maybe so we feel bad for Cruz? The Pentagon? the Republicans?</p>

<p>- TPTB (from what I can tell) are not one sided but believe an ends to their means --- who benefits?</p>

<p>- It should be interesting to see who they pin this on</p>
