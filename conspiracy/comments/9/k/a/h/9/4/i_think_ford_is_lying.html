        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>i was thinking about this whole kavanaugh v ford situation and it got me thinking about how the government is so under the control of money. i&#39;m a very opened minded person and i think that its weird how kavanaugh is being accused of this and the woman is now bringing it up like 30 years later blah blah</p>

<p><em>that&#39;s not the case though</em></p>

<p>I was talking to my girlfriend on about this (shes conservative, Im more liberal) and for as much as i want to believe this woman, <em>i cant.</em> It all seems so fishy.</p>

<p>One thing as of why people &quot;believe&quot; her is because shes a sexual assault victim, they were at a party, and <strong><em>most</em></strong> of the people who believe her think kavanaugh is a bad guy, whatever right? I just think that <strong><em>its so weird that she so happens to remember it as kavanaugh but not really anything else.</em></strong> she has to read her story on a piece of paper and if you look at the hearing, her body language is so strange. shes not reactive enough for <strong>me</strong> to believe her. im a woman, im the most liberal piece of shit in the world, but i cannot believe her. i feel like shes lying about something and shes just doing this for attention or is being paid off by the democratic party.</p>

<p>Also, i think its kind of weird how she set up a go fund me for her &quot;legal expenses&quot; but the democratic party stepped up and said they were paying for it. so shes keeping that money <strong>ANYWAY</strong>.</p>

<p>lastly, she said she &quot;is scared to fly&quot; yet took 15 flights <strong>within the last year</strong> for work and her oceanography hobby. so i don&#39;t get that???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its about character.  We knew nothing about this lady.  We did know Democrats had signs for every SCOTUS candidate that Trump shared prior to naming his nomination.  We also knew they wanted to delay.  When this accusation hit, everyone was caught off guard.  The guy had 6 FBI background checks and had worked in the 2nd most powerful court circuit in America.   Therefore we wanted to understand if this was a political smear.  </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Ford did not respond to Senate request, all the information behind the allegation was kept from the committee yet Democrats had a letter explaining the alleged sexual assault.  She also had a polygraph.  After several days of no response, they finally replied.  She stated she was afraid to fly and preferred to drive and would need &quot;time&quot; to get there and adjust.  The senate offered to come to her but her lawyers didn&#39;t share their willingness to accommodate her.   People found her Facebook page under an alias - all kinds of travel from photos were public.  She was actually in Maryland recently and flew.  She may fear flying, but in her opening statement - what was her reason for coming forward?  She came forward because she felt it was important.  Right?   </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>That response of &quot;fear of flying&quot; may be true but it hasn&#39;t prevented her from flying and it was an excuse to delay.   Does that mean her entire allegation is a set up to delay?  She didn&#39;t give any details and protected herself from perjury by repeating, &quot;I don&#39;t know, I cannot recall, I don&#39;t remember.&quot;  The evidence of this being a delay/political smear is very compelling. </p>

<p>LOL @ writing this with any seriousness when defending <em>Kavanaugh</em>. Kavanaugh who got in front of the panel and embarrassed himself by being obnoxious and combative, while refusing to answer a lot of questions and demonstrably lying about others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re so ignorant.  He went through 31 hours of interviews, answered over 1200 written questions - more than any other SCOTUS nominee....had FBI background check only to get falsely accused of sexual assault and being a serial gang rapist.  His family and little girls have had their lives threatened.</p>

<p>That would test any human being and he handled it well.  You on the other hand get triggered by the word character.  Yet you fail to look at the man&#39;s accomplishments and his own situation.  Very mature</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His number of flights, 15, seems to be completely pulled out of his ass unless it’s in a video clip, because it’s not actually written in his own link that he provided when asked for proof of the number lol. Either way, she does admit to taking quite a few flights and being scared of flying. Unfortunately for morons acting like that’s the SMOKING GUN OMG...her being scared of flights and still flying doesn’t prove a fucking thing lol. I’m terrified of spiders, if one landed on me while I was driving I would honestly probably end up getting in an accident from freaking the fuck out. Despite my complete fear of them, I still deal with them when they’re in my house. Does that mean I’m a liar? Have the people saying this is a smoking gun, so basically the_donald frequenters, never done something despite being afraid of doing it?  Sometimes, especially when it involves getting to a god damn vacation, you’re willing to do things you’re terrified of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fly A LOT and it still sort of scares me when turbulence hits. I think that is kind of common. On the other side of the turbulence thing, I have been on some flights with bad turbulence (not severe) and while I am white knuckling the chair, I will look all around the plane and see most sleeping, reading, listening to music etc..like nothing is wrong. Nothing IS wrong, turbulence is normal, but it scares me being in a tiny tube shooting through the air at 600mph 33,000 feet above the ground or ocean! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The argument is that she was too afraid to fly, period. And that&#39;s why she had to delay in order to get to DC.</p>

<p>No one gives a fuck how many flights she took in one year. The point is she took them frequently. Most people don&#39;t unless they do so for business or pleasure, and in such cases,  they arent afraid to do it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The length of time matters now? All of the Cosby accusers could remember the year of the incident at least, Dr. Ford can&#39;t remember the month, day, relative time of day, people involved (besides Kavinaugh), or even the year of the incident.</p>

<p>She said there were 4 boys involved to her therapist, a statement which her polygraph supported, but then changed that to two during testimony. </p>

<p>She supposedly brought up Kavinaugh in therapy in 2012, with worries that he may be nominated for the SC. Why not step forward when he&#39;s a federal judge?</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t about me believing Kavinaugh in any way, Kavinaugh shouldn&#39;t have to prove he <em>didn&#39;t</em> do anything, that&#39;s not how the justice system works.</p>

<p>“Ford said she told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband,” the report reads. “The therapist’s notes, portions of which were provided by Ford and reviewed by The Washington Post, do not mention Kavanaugh’s name but say she reported that she was attacked by students ‘from an elitist boys’ school’ who went on to become ‘highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.&#39;”</p>

<p>“The notes say four boys were involved, a discrepancy Ford says was an error on the therapist’s part. Ford said there were four boys at the party but only two in the room,” it states.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes me curious is that <em>this woman is a psychologist</em>.<br/>
If there&#39;s one profession that has many <em>techniques for overcoming anxiety or resilience in the face of trauma</em>, it&#39;s psychology. Cognitive Behavior Therapy is highly regarded by those within the profession and I can&#39;t help but wonder whether she&#39;s ever availed herself of the techniques it has to offer. Surely she knows of it.<br/>
The other aspect is one of integrity and ethical practice within the profession. Psychologists have fairly strong standards in how they treat research subjects and must be both extremely open with their objectives and cautious in their treatment. There&#39;s a high degree of rigorous adherence to objectivity and ethical practice. Assuming her professional training spills over into her personal life, I can&#39;t understand how she would permit &#39;criminal&#39; or &#39;unethical&#39; behavior to persist without calling it in.</p>

<p>Adding these together, it strikes me as odd that this woman waited so long to make this claim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She&#39;s crystal clear in her recalling of Kavanaugh; she would have to be blatantly lying. </p>

<p>Except she&#39;s not crystal clear, even her husband and her therapist don&#39;t corroborate each other stories.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Watching Kavanaugh, I can see that she&#39;s not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t how evidence works</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Women are sexually abused all the time in this society and don&#39;t report it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we should believe all of the accusations by default, the literal opposite of the way our justice system is designed to work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My friend was raped in the past year, did everything right in reporting it immediately, and still wasn&#39;t taken seriously by law enforcement.</p>

<p>Anecdotal evidence is not evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>t&#39;s been a humiliating struggle for her, which is why women regularly don&#39;t report sexual abuse and it&#39;s insanely common in this patriarchal society of ours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just because you feel this way doesn&#39;t mean the justice system should assume guilt until innocence can be &quot;proven&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is: She has no reason to lie and the testimony was so believable that even fucking Trump had to admit it. Kavanaugh is the quintessential patriarchal power grabber; look at his positions, such as unfettered presidential power and banning women from having abortions and literally working with Bush operative Carl Rove. Also, there are two other such accusations of sexual assault, which appear very credible. None of these people are taking outside money, and Ford has had death threats and has had to move in fear of her life. Kavanaugh is very <em>very</em> likely a sexual assaulter.</p>

<p>You know trolling when people are disingenuous and don&#39;t participate in a fair discussion. The trolling on this sub right now is extremely heavy, which means that the powers that be are scared of us. Let&#39;s not be naïve; let&#39;s keep calling this shit out and using dialectics to find truth. I think the trolls are losing. </p>

<p>No, that&#39;s not it -- in the state of Maryland, attempted rape also has no statute of limitations, and Ford&#39;s allegation will be investigated if she files charges there. Also in either case, Ford is not compelled to press charges if she doesn&#39;t want to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My comments regarding pay had to do with the many crazy comments I read. You on the other hand sound like you have a legitimate argument.  An argument not based on pure emotion.  I am not informed on what you are concerned about. This has turned into more of a right or wrong argument. Many, including myself, see the sexual assault claims made by these women as an unreasonable unfair and partisan attack on a man. Just because they do not want him does not mean they can play dirty and ruin him. So, it is completely fine for you and I to have different ideas on who can or should be appointed, but is it ok to try to stop the appointment with slanderous, hurtful, unsubstantiated claims. THAT is what this is about. You may not like his way of thinking but I country has  a set route of appointment and we are on that route til these unsubstantiated claims came forward. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kavanaugh and dual sovereignty laws...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s not difficult to understand why the president and Hatch might believe Kavanaugh is a judge who will vote to overrule the dual sovereignty doctrine.</p>

<p>When the president was campaigning, he published a list of candidates he would consider for appointment to the United States Supreme Court. Kavanaugh’s name was not on the list.</p>

<p>After it came out, Kavanaugh began writing quite a few dissenting opinions on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in which he made clear his willingness to overrule long-standing precedents in a way that increase the power of the president. Also, he has written papers in which he stated that presidents should be immune from prosecution for criminal activity and civil liability—it’s ironic because that negates Kavanaugh’s own career of serving on Kenn Starr’s staff when President Bill Clinton was prosecuted).</p>

<p>Kavanaugh has also made it clear in his writings that he would be willing to overturn the cases dealing with the unlawful behavior of President Richard Nixon.</p>

<p>In fact, his writings read like a wish list of answers to every legal peril the president currently finds himself in. In a way that is not totally clear, the writings grabbed Trump’s attention; however, what is clear is that after these writings is the President added Kavanaugh’s name to the list of Supreme Court possibilities.</p>

<p>It has everything to do with Kavanaugh politics. His behavior now is very shady. Also, the way he answered questions about his past is very shady. Proving that Kavanaugh is a liar is an indirect way of proving Ford is telling the truth.</p>

<p>I just think that its so weird that she so happens to remember it as kavanaugh but not really anything else. </p>

<p>Do you have experience with trauma? When in a traumatic situation, you always hear people describe &quot;time slowing down&quot;. That&#39;s because you become hyper-aware in those situations. It&#39;s a defense mechanism. That means you will have better recollection of what happened during the traumatic part, but not necessarily before and after.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>she has to read her story on a piece of paper and if you look at the hearing, her body language is so strange. shes not reactive enough</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As would most people in an intimidating high stress situation where millions of people will be hanging on your every word. If this is a professional hit job, why not do it better? Reheard the story. Rehearse the body language. Script the reactions... What a sloppy hit job.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i feel like shes lying about something and shes just doing this for attention or is being paid off by the democratic party.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kavanaugh is <em>objectively</em> lying about something. Just focus in on his crap explanations for his yearbook jokes. We <em>all</em> know what those mean. He could chalk it up to being meaningless immature jokes, and I&#39;d believe him. However, he flat out lies about them. Devil&#39;s Triangle is not a drinking game. You are not an &quot;alumnus&quot; of some girl by being their friend. Then he lies about not drinking on weekdays despite his calendar directly refuting that. We aren&#39;t stupid.</p>

<p>Maybe Ford is mistaken. That&#39;s possible. The fact is that people are coming out of the woodwork to back up the drunken and belligerent description of Kavanaugh&#39;s character. His own yearbook backs up his alleged character. The reputation of his Fraternity is in line with his alleged character. The memoir of his friend Mark Judge is in line with that character. The fact that he&#39;s lying about such stupid things makes me believe Ford over him.</p>

<p>Then we can talk about money. There was a huge media campaign promoting Kavanuagh. Then we have a suspicious debt that was mysteriously paid off. There is <em>tons</em> of money behind him that can&#39;t even be touched by the GoFundMe campaigns for Ford. The GoFundMe campaign is more of an outlet for liberals to say &quot;fuck you&quot; to Republicans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of money, both people are gonna be okay in this situation. </p>

<p>There’s more evidence of ford lying than kavanaugh. 
Primarily because ford keeps changing her story. NOT because she’s experiencing trama. She can’t even say he raped her. She says “sexually assaulted” or “I don’t remember”. 
It’s also “there was 4 people in the room” then “ it was only two”.
It’s also “he forced himself on top” or “his friend forced himself and he watched”. 
There’s 3 unreliable things she said and you cannot tell me those key details are most important. She can’t keep her story straight. The “witness” that was even brought in can’t even say what happened. </p>

<p>Look at that hearing. She is acting unprofessional. Look at how girly her body language is. Now look at her when she lies or stretches the truth. </p>

<p>But regardless of ALL of that, kavanaugh’s career is finished. She’s probably gonna get more popularity and be a speaker for women or whatever. Kavanaugh will ALWAYS be accused of sexual assault in the court of public opinion because he’s actually being defensive. Every person has to react a certain way. And hell yeah, if my career was ruined by some woman who was lying, of course I’m gonna react pissed off. Because there’s so much evidence that she’s lying and not enough that she’s telling the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO as a woman and survivor of sexual assault, she acts as though she’s suffered trauma at a very young age, or there is some type of personality disorder. I say this because the way she spoke - I can only describe as an alien coming to this planet and speaking how they think they should speak in this type of scenario. It’s beyond bad acting - it’s as if she doesn’t really know how to “act” “normal” so she gives it her best shot. This is why I think many said she came off cutesy, or why she never actually cried but just croaked out her testimony. The emotions didn’t not appear to be genuine, the emotions were also fleeting. One moment she’s croaking and the next she’s attempting to make a joke about caffeine. </p>

<p>Personally I think she was deeply abused as a child and thus is a false memory because her real memories are to too traumatic to deal with. Thats assuming any of this is true at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Referring to me as “dumb” in a logical discussion is more like a kindergarten insult. Yes, the traumatic part sticks, but it shouldn’t change. That’s why she’s being called a liar. Go listen to the hearing. She changes her story. When she does her polygraph (although it’s an unreliable test) she was asked questions that didn’t match her story. Kavanaugh can lie too and I’m sure he is about something. But you don’t understand the part of “I want to believe her” but there’s so much stuff pointing in the wrong direction that I can’t. I don’t support him. I don’t agree with many of his politics. But this discussion is based on facts and opinions going against each other. </p>

<p>And again, I’d rather be called stupid than dumb for displaying my opinion on a controversial topic and expecting someone like you in this. I love you how you say “kind of dumb” as if I said something that offended you. I’m sure you’ve had something happened in the past and many women like myself, yourself, and everyone in between have had something just as terrible if not worse happen to them. I’m not discrediting them. I’m discrediting ford. 
The only reason I feel like women sympathize with her is because they can relate. And yeah that’s great that she has support, but that doesn’t cover the fact that her story is weak. The weakest ever. </p>

<p>I’m sure there’s many other victims that have more proof, would LOVE to go the senate and make them hear about the corrupt politicians that are in that don’t deserve to be there. </p>

I think she’s lying and many other people share the same opinion because there’s too many holes in her story that don’t add up. 
Just because kavanaugh is a bad judge doesn’t mean he raped her. Many people don’t support kavanaugh, even republicans.
Adding on to that, ford can’t even say he raped her. Not because she’s be traumatized but she literally cannot remember. She’s just claiming sexual assault. 
Again, I don’t support kavanaugh because yes he is a corrupt politician but you have to look at the facts. Ford is lying. They both are about something. 
There’s more evidence of Ford lying than anything else. Kavanaugh is bad news but this accusation ruined his career regardless of what people say. </p>

The ONLY one who will have ruined their career is Ford. What motive could she possible have or lying? She&#39;s destroyed her own life and career for likely NOTHING. Kavanaugh will still probably be appointed to the Supreme Court. She came forward because it happened and she had to finally admit it. There is no motivation for her to lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stupid and ignorant for a logical discussion is a kindergarten insult. It has no effect on me because I will stand by the evidence that I believe are facts. 
The motivation to lie will always be there regardless of if you want to believe it or not. She doesn’t have to pay her legal fees, her friends in the Democratic Party are supporting her financially and emotionally, and I’m sure the Supreme Court judges would not support kavanaugh regardless if he is proven innocent or guilty. 
She ruined his career. That’s probably for the best. Once you have a sexual assault accusation against you as a judge, you are done. That’s what a lot of people don’t understand. Many politicians have gone down the drain over accusations like this and I’m sure he will too. 
Also, she can’t remember key parts of what happened that night except what happened to her. She can’t remember how she got home, with who, etc etc. She even ADMITS to saying that she can’t remember (if you listen to her testimony). 
So again, I’m sure I’m stupid and ignorant for looking at the obvious and pointing it out. </p>

<p>Bill Clinton raped tons of women and he was the POTUS...his wife almost was too.</p>

<p>They are all corrupt. I&#39;ll never understand how these politicians convince people to vote against their own self interest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how you take the words I said in the wrong context as if I’m going against every victim who has suffered worse. </p>

<p>I’m a woman. And I’m sure there’s many women out there that have more evidence to run these politicians down and even take them out and put them in prison. I want them to be at senate hearings instead of Ford. I would LITERALLY want anyone else BUT ford. </p>

<p>I also love how you’re saying that the only reason she came forward was because her lawyers said that she didn’t have to pay. 
No.
Her lawyers at first we’re going to make her pay. But then they realized how much recognition she was gonna get and they said “don’t worry about it” AFTER the fact. Not before, after. And either way I don’t think she would have a problem paying it because of her profession. </p>

<p>I never said I was supporting kavanaugh. In fact I think he’s lying about something too. I hate his politics and I hope this situation ruins him. </p>

<p>Also, this “wall of information” yet people have sources of actual evidence supporting what I’m saying. So go ahead and read on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you blame me? When the house voted on it 50-47? </p>

<p>In WHAT part of my post did I EVER say that I supported him? All I said is that ford is lying. Women lie and I made an argument that she was. Wow I didn’t know that put in kavanaugh’s politics and put me against women, when I myself am a women. Wow I’m such a traitor. </p>

<p>If you read a few other people that have claimed that I “support” him, you should go read those posts. Because I CLEARLY don’t. But since you are probably NOT going to do that, I’ll repeat myself for you. (: </p>

<p>I DO NOT SUPPORT KAVANAUGH’S POLITICS!!!!!!!! IF YOU READ MY P O S T I CALL MYSELF A LIBERAL. I SAID FORD WAS LYING ABOUT WHAT SHE CLAIMS HAPPENED TO HER. THERE’S SO MANY POINTS POINTING TO HER LYING THAN TELLING THE TRUTH SO I SAID MY OPINION LOL. Get butthurt if you want. </p>

<p>Whatever happened, happened. That’s obviously my fault since that’s what you’re claiming. </p>

<p>So continue about something else that’s probably my fault since you’re so mad. (: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s also False Memory Syndrome, in the 80s there was a big ritual child abuse scare going on. Hundreds of people were accused of horrific crimes against children by adults with &quot;revovered memories&quot;. People wer arrested, went to jail, lost jobs, businesses marriages. Hundreds of people&#39;s lives ruined and in the end only a handful of accusations proved to be true. The accusers truely believed what they were saying, could even pass lie detectors, but that&#39;s what this False Memory Syndrome does.</p>

<p>This is why you can&#39;t just believe every accusation straight out. </p>
