    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard it said many times... the difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion is a good tax lawyer, but ultimately the IRS can pretty much make up rules and apply them selectively, so even if tons of people have been using a &quot;legal loophole&quot; for years they can always decide to go after someone they don&#39;t like.  </p>

<p>Who knows how this will play, but I think Trump has been making a lot of money for other elites, so he&#39;ll probably still get away with stuff that &quot;regular people&quot; can&#39;t.  Same as most others like him, and large corporations as well.</p>
