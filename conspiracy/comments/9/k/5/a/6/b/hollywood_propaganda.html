        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I tried to watch the new Scicario movie. After about 15-20 minutes into the movie it became quite obvious it was a propaganda piece by the Us military and CIA. Yemeni men blowing up American supermarket. Pentagon official saying full weight of American military will be used against attackers.  (While the US help Saudi led coalition strikes in Yemen.) </p>

<p>Just seems like a good way of perversing peoples view of Yemen and its people before it is common knowledge that America helped in the countrys destruction.</p>

<p>Or am I being too cynical in this view? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also would like to add that generally it feels like american series and movies are following the current political situation. Like for example I have noticed that a lot of newly released series and movies have subtle moments where they depict on the issue of &quot;Gender&quot; and &quot;Feminism&quot;.  Now I don&#39;t know if they just hop on the train to follow whats &quot;hot&quot; at the moment or are they told to release movies and series with that content as a means of propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember it quite vividly. My uncle went on two tours because he was a &quot;patriot&quot;. The second tour he came back with a bullet in his head and a frenzied fear of fireworks. They lied to him in ROTC, straight up without a bit of shame. The movies at the time were all designed to get young men to do their patriotic duty and enlist, despite the draft and the body bags coming back. It wasn&#39;t until the end of the war approached that Hollywood flipped sides. My uncle lived with seizures for the rest of his life, and finally died when the bullet poisoned enough of his brain. A Purple Heart and a silver lieutenant bar didn&#39;t make up for the hell they put him through.</p>

<p>Washington DC’s role behind the scenes in Hollywood goes deeper than you think.</p>

<p>Files we obtained, mainly through the US Freedom of Information Act, show that between 1911 and 2017, more than 800 feature films received support from the US Government’s Department of Defence (DoD), a significantly higher figure than previous estimates indicate. These included blockbuster franchises such as Transformers, Iron Man, and The Terminator.</p>

<p>On television, we found over 1,100 titles received Pentagon backing – 900 of them since 2005</p>

<p>U.S. Military Helps Create Hollywood Films on War and Warriors </p>

<p>The Pentagon’s partnership with Hollywood starts at this West Los Angeles office tower, where every branch of the military keeps a liaison office to the entertainment industry.</p>

<p>&quot;Our mission here is to get the Navy onto the big screen and the little screen every chance we get, with every production that wants to use us. I’ll be blatant about it: We’re trying to get the Navy out there.&quot;</p>

<p>And what do Hollywood studios want in return for giving the military screen time? &quot;Usually, it’s equipment. Usually, they’re looking for toys. For them, we’re a provider. We’re a supplier, like everybody else. And Hollywood, they want the real thing. If they can get the real thing, they want the real thing.</p>

<p><strong>If you want the military&#39;s assistance, you have to give them five copies of your script. They review the script. They make changes to the script to make it conform to the kind of film that they want to see. Most Americans have no idea that the content of the films and TV shows that they&#39;re watching are being influenced by military censors, that the military or the government is telling filmmakers what to say and what not to say.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The only thing Hollywood likes more than a good movie is a good deal,” David Robb explains, and that’s why the producers of films like “Top Gun,” “Stripes” and “The Great Santini” have altered their scripts to accommodate Pentagon requests. In exchange, they get inexpensive access to the military locations, vehicles, troops and gear they need to make their movies. </p>

<p>As one of the technical advisors, Maj. David Georgi of the Army, said to me, “If they don’t do what I say, I take my toys and go away.”</p>

<p>....Of course, an ‘R’ rating means children under 17 have to be accompanied by a parent, so a lot of 16- and 17-year-olds couldn’t see this picture. And the Air Force wanted young people to see this so they’d get a good, positive image of the military and join up. So they changed it.</p>

<p>How the CIA Helped Make “Zero Dark Thirty” </p>

<p>When Zero Dark Thirty premiered in 2012, the Hollywood film about the hunt for Osama bin Laden became a blockbuster hit.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, the CIA secretly worked with the filmmakers, and the movie portrayed the agency’s controversial “enhanced interrogation techniques” — widely described as torture — as a key to uncovering information that led to the finding and killing of bin Laden... but the massive Senate torture report released in December 2014 found that the program was brutal, mismanaged and — most importantly — didn’t work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Movie was a colossal flop, they made a ton of bad choices and it ruined a potential new franchise. Not only was the film politicized, Emily Blunt did not return for the sequel because she was tired of being forced to suck the director&#39;s dick every day for her starring role. He told her she&#39;d only come back if she kept servicing him and she said no. So they reworked the script to make it about del Toro&#39;s character and turned it into another sausage party where the stars and directors fucked teen Latinas all shoot long and barely focused on making the film. What a disaster! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it really like that? I’m really surprised, I felt like the original Sicario was very harsh on alphabet agencies. I felt like Benecio Del Toro was supposed to represent the scum that CIA agents today are, the whole plot showed how terrible and covert our “black war” with Mexico really is, and they even touched upon how the CIA likes it like this because when it was all in Columbia it was too profitable and controlled, whereas the CIA likes their willful idiots to be controlled chaos. I definitely felt like the first one was trying to relay the subtle message that the CIA created all the splinter cartels by getting rid of Escobar the same way we created ISIS by getting rid of Saddam, purposefully so we could have unlimited little enemies to fight </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really enjoyed the first Sicario, and how they used the Blunt as a means to get jurisdiction, amongst the other stuff going behind the scenes. It was damn well shot too. [<strong>SPOILERS</strong>]The second one was full of cliches, and completely went against the first movie in enabling to go weapons free and do whatever they want due to the aforementioned silly ass terror attacks portrayed(a supermarket? And barely killed like 10 people). Then half way through the movie contradicts itself and reprimands them for doing whatever which made NO sense. But they had to have them go rogue for some arbitrary reason. It just felt like a pointless cash in sequel and made me very sad. Luckily Moviepass blunts the pain  a bit but hard to wash my mouth of that garbage </p>

<p>The First Man is gonna be some transparent propaganda. American Sniper was a US Army Commercial. The army took over Disney during ww2 and made military cartoons.</p>

<p>Only ONE attacker was from Yemen. The rest were American born Jihadists...the Governments plan was canceled as they realized they were wrong and decided to have their black ops team clean up the mess they already created. This was the major conflict in the film...NOT the terrorist attacks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are missing the point. It doesnt matter if they are relevant or not. It happened in the movie. </p>

<p>America is currently aiding in the destrucion of Yemen. I find it pretty strange that all of a sudden people from Yemen are being used as terrorists in Hollywood movies. </p>

<p>But serious, if they&#39;re intent on waking up, then no, one can sleep forever. But if they are not intent, then we need to keep trowing cold water on their faces until they do wake up. In the initial moments of waking up the groggy will resent the the perpetrator, but as time passes they may find admiration for their sleep disturber. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t be afraid to tell the truth!</p>

<p>Much Love and Peace!</p>
