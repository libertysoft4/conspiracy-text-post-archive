        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>YouTube seems to filter conspiracy videos listed on the top lists, which seems to bias online information by quite a bit. Reddit doesn&#39;t seem to care, shouldn&#39;t this kind of silent suppression be front page news?</p>

<p>Regardless of what you think of Charlie Sheen or the information, shouldn&#39;t everyone be allowed to make up their own minds? I&#39;m not the biggest fan of Alex Jones myself but he creates important conversation about subjects more people should care about. Charlie put his reputation out there and is getting trampled on by the media, I would upvote just to get the word out.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t need to prove a conspiracy, we just need to show that there are holes in the official story that those in power must respond and be accountable for.</p>

<p>The post on YouTube suppressing the video is currently at zero total, I have no idea if it was silently banned on Reddit, if this post about it will be, or if I am suppressed as a user. Rather than dwell on paranoia, we&#39;ll find out shortly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possible, although what appeared to be happening was the strange phenomenon of getting exactly 1 downvote for each upvote until about 20 or so votes, keeping the sum at an even zero. After that normal opinion seems to roll forward.</p>

<p>While I don&#39;t know why search engine placement &amp; social network manipulation companies would really care about this kind of posts, the idea of suppressing specific news with a number of networked or simply collaborative accounts is feasible. After all, this is the kind of service they sell to their clients.</p>

<p>Rather than think someone was trying to deliberately suppress this news, I&#39;d be more willing to imagine that someone was trying to push their own spam up by downvoting everything else as there were hardly any comments, only silent downvoting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m willing to give benefit of doubt to YouTube&#39;s moderation and server update choke ups, at some point the video was stuck at 303 views with thousands of comments and ratings. This could be just a hiccup although I remember some similar cases from before.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not shown on &quot;Top News&quot; listing but can be found on the &quot;most watched&quot; lists, which sometimes appear to update at nonintuitive hour/date boundaries.</p>

<p>Perhaps it&#39;s simply less effective posting a video on YouTube on a Friday instead of a Monday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;303 views&quot; thing is normal. Whenever a new video starts getting a LOT of activity, youtube stops updating the view count at 303 until a moderator (or something) can check out the video. They do this to stop votebots from spamming videos to the front page.</p>

<p>YES.</p>

<p>And a lot of people have made up their mind that Obama is a socialist Kenyan Marxist Jewish Muslim fascist Nazi who is going to raid Medicare to create death camps in Florida (via FEMA) enforced by his step-dancing negro army.  And that science is all fake and is a plot to try to kill religion.  </p>

<p>And that Jesus spoke English.</p>
