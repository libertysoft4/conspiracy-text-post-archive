        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From the Joe Rogan podcast I noticed some things. First Elon doesn&#39;t enjoy being a Car company CEO. He gave mostly one word answers and just seemed interested. However when talked about space his eyes lit up, you could tell how passionate he is on space exploration. But if he just left Tesla it could really hurt the company that he wants to succeed. All of these tweets are have been intetional to force his resignation. That way it looks as a positive for Tesla instead of a uncertain time. Now he can focus on Spacex instead of Tesla&#39;s production issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was referring to with Neuralink. I do want to search for solutions as well. Let me remind you you just said . &gt;because if we don&#39;t &#39;hook in&#39; we may be left behind or worse when the AI singularity is reached. It&#39;s coming and we will not be the dominant species anymore.  </p>

<p>In my opinion you seem to be approaching it from a &quot;we&#39;re fucked attitude&quot;. We can both go on about each other&#39;s pessimism but that&#39;s beside the point. This particular solution is not the best one in my opinion. I didn&#39;t mean to insinuate there is no solution to a technological singularity, I just want more solutions on the table before we get too cozy with this one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>those are all extremely unlikely, but it is public knowledge that the US government has run many corporations for various purposes. there&#39;s even a list of cia front organizations on wikipedia. the fact remains that the us government is the top investor in each of musk&#39;s ventures and as of now, it appears that he&#39;s effectively lost billions of tax payers dollars. this isn&#39;t even a conspiracy theory, you can google it and find that many main stream sources have argued that when it all comes out this will make the solyndra debacle look like nothing. there&#39;s very little evidence that any technology sold by musk&#39;s brands is anything new. the only one that there&#39;s a solid argument for is the space x tech, but there&#39;s almost no paper trail demonstrating that any of that was designed under his direction. while i&#39;m not saying i believe this element, it&#39;s completely possible that space x uses tech that was actually designed by the government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tesla imo is a corporate conglomerate through shares of car and oil companies using all those patents they have been hoarding for decades to see if they can create a truly automated production line. </p>

<p>They gave the patents away so everyone can build electric cars probably global pressure on this since all the big car companies are all subsidiaries of GM or Volkswagen or something (i am generalising a lot here). And in an interview sometime ago with elon, at a tesla factory, Elon looked down and answered, yeah we might have to start putting more people back on the line. Because of drawbacks on full automation. </p>

<p>By now Elon probably feels drained having to manage so much of the headache of trying to make that work, that he recently resigned. Plus, with china going all electric cars by 2025, and other european manufacturers, also diving into electric, Teslas market dominance is going to vain fast. They are already constantly behind production numbers, not meeting orders etc. Its a huge clusterfuck. </p>

<p>Plus I bet Elon already feels like he has changed the world with Tesla majority are not viewing electric cars are better, and as times goes on, its becoming easier to own one). </p>

<p>Where as Space, space has always been the golden goose. Once Space is commercialised, resources and production can go offworld. Once a space elevator is built, production can all go to space with automation and that would free up earth a little bit. Plus allow us to colonise space etc. Its a no brainer that thats where the frontier of discoveries and 1sts is. </p>

<p>To me Elon has been a great PR head. With him being on Space X and Tesla acting like Tony stark, and at one time, even having a beard like him....screams just a publicity figure who is knowledgeable about the business to sell it, but I doubt he has any real power to sway the direction of development or company&#39;s values. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Elon is brilliant? Let me tell you a little story.  There was this company called Enron.    </p>

<p>Enron had all these rich guys working there, doing shady shit.  When the shit started hitting the fan, the rich guys working there weren&#39;t able to sell their stock because they would get busted for insider trading and/or other shit.    </p>

<p>But one guy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Pai">Lou Pai</a>, this guy, he used to be CEO of Enron, really smart financial dude.  He <strong>also</strong> couldn&#39;t sell his stock.    </p>

<p>Except, he used to like to go to tittie bars for lunch.  And his wife found out.  And she filed for divorce.  And the judge ordered Pai to sell his stock.    </p>

<p>That&#39;s right.  The judge ordered him to sell his stock.    </p>

<p>He liquidated before everything fell apart, and it was 100% legal.  His wife got divorced and he married the stripper.</p>

Let me remind you you just said . &gt;because if we don&#39;t &#39;hook in&#39; we may be left behind or worse when the AI singularity is reached. It&#39;s coming and we will not be the dominant species anymore.  </p>

<p>In my opinion you seem to be approaching it from a &quot;we&#39;re fucked attitude&quot;. We can both go on about each other&#39;s pessimism but that&#39;s beside the point. This particular solution is not the best one in my opinion. I didn&#39;t mean to insinuate there is no solution to a technological singularity, I just want more solutions on the table before we get too cozy with this one. </p>
