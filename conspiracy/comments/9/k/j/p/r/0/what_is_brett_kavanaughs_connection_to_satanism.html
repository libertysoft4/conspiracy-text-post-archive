<p>After the nation’s founding, corporations were, as they are today, the result of charters granted by the state. However, unlike today, they were limited in how long they were permitted to exist (typically 20 or 30 years), only permitted to deal in one commodity, not permitted to own shares in other corporations, and their property holdings were expressly limited to what they needed to accomplish their specific, corporate business goals.</p>

<p>Put another way, every single investment bank on Wall Street, as we know it today, would have been illegal in the days of our founding.</p>

<p>And here is the big one —in the early days of the nation, most states had rules on the books making any political contribution by a corporation a criminal offense.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&gt; he is the only one to admit that he played games based on the devil and lied about what the game really was when asked about it. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>These are contradictory claims. </p>

<p>Kavanaugh claimed under oath that &#39;Devil&#39;s Triangle&#39; is a drinking game. Most people (myself included) believe it&#39;s actually a threesome with two men, and that Kavanaugh lied about this because it would tend to make Dr. Ford&#39;s claim seem more credible.</p>

<p>So you can really only claim that Kavanaugh <strong>either</strong> &#39;played games based on the devil&#39; (itself a huge stretch) or &#39;lied about what the game really was when asked about it&#39; (and in fact it isn&#39;t even a game).</p>

<p>Either he really did play a drinking game called &#39;Devil&#39;s Triangle&#39; in high school -- in which case he did not lie about it last week;</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>he did lie last week because there is no drinking game called &#39;Devil&#39;s Triangle,&#39; so he never played it.</p>

<p>Those of us who believe Kavanaugh lied, believe that &#39;Devil&#39;s Triangle&#39; is not a game at all, but a reference to a sex activity. AFAIK nobody believes that &#39;Devil&#39;s Triangle&#39; actually is a game, but that Kavanaugh lied about how it is played.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kavanaugh is saying that the yearbook quote &quot;Devil&#39;s Triangle&quot; was not a reference to a MMF threesome as most seem to know it refers to, but actually refers to a drinking game similar to &quot;Quarters&quot;.  He &quot;admitted&quot; it in the sense that he&#39;s trying to change the meaning of it to refer to something more innocuous.  </p>
