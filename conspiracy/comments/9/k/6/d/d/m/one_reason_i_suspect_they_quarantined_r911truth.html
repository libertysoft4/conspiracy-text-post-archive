<p>Any  country&#39;s intelligence agency could have probably pulled off 9/11 if they tried really tried, but it is the total global mainstream cover up of WTC 7 for so many years given 10 seconds of commonly available self-evident video that proves the official story cannot be true is thus a cover up that could only have been perpetrated by a globally dominant cabal.</p>

<p>Of course, that has been true for  years, so the timing is probably something else, such as inciting/distracting people--maybe near election time.</p>

<p>That is false, NIST claim the main water line was damaged (without offering any evidence) and so the first 10 stories had no water, the rest of the 37 floors were fed by the massive water tanks in the mechanical floors.</p>

<p>That would be enough to bring it down, no explosives needed.</p>

<p>Are you actually implying that after 9/11, controlled demolition business are no longer needed to completely demolish a steel frame skyscraper, very neatly in to a pile on the ground and the owner can just light very small office fires and hope for the best?</p>

<p>Controlled demolition, it is actually a well known method, they do it so the building falls basically within it&#39;s own footprint to limit damage to surrounding buildings.</p>

<p>How can it look like a progressive collapse, an untested and unproven theory, when it is an allegedly the first and only time in human history it has happened?</p>

<p>Not only that, but it looks <a href="https://youtu.be/xxl06jxfgRk?t=5s"><strong>EXACTLY</strong></a> like a controlled demolition.</p>

<p>Not only that, but this building went in to gravitational acceleration, which on it&#39;s own, is direct proof of an energy source (explosives) removing structural supports, which is direct proof for controlled demolition.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you know what a progressive collapse looks like. </p>

<p>This collapse is measured at free fall acceleration.   The building falls uniformly straight down through the path of resistance.   For free fall to be measured - as anyone can do - ALL column resistance must be removed simultaneously. </p>

<p>Logically that is inconsistent with any progressive collapse mechanism.   For all column support to be removed at once, there must have been well timed and placed explosives.    </p>

<p>Even NIST says they don&#39;t represent reality. and won&#39;t share the input model for &#39;national security reasons&#39;    the purpose of those models was to distinguish between two competing (and false) possible scenarios.   For accurate modelling, I recommend the more recent university study - which agrees that fires could not have been the cause of the collapse that we observed.   </p>

<p><a href="https://www.wtc7evaluation.org/">https://www.wtc7evaluation.org/</a></p>

<p>You ask me to  point to evidence of the collapse where explosives are heard..  by whom?  don&#39;t you agree that the area was well evacuated by then?  there is this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The University of Alaska study has problems too. It concerns me that they make such a definite statement considering they are far from publishing anything. It makes it sound like they had a end result in mind before they started.</p>

<p>Also, they are only focusing on one connection, when NIST identified multiple connections that we&#39;re at the conditions to fail. So, if nothing else, they proved THAT connection didn&#39;t fail, but they&#39;ve not even looked at the others yet it seems.</p>

<p>So, was that firefighter in on it too? If someone describes some as an explosion, that automatically means there are bombs?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The NIST &#39;model&#39; was not even meant to be an accurate model.  </p>

<p>You can see that even their inaccurate model shows the outer walls crumpling because they are not independent from the interior columns and floors.  They are solidly connected.  See the blueprints. </p>

<p>Therefore there is no way that you can achieve the simultaneous straight down collapse through the path of resistance at free fall acceleration for over 8 stories unless you remove all column support with well timed and place explosives.</p>

<p>We can argue the merits of the Alaska study in another thread.   They used the most forgiving conditions to try and accommodate the fire theory...it doesn&#39;t come close.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That &quot;Pull it&quot; argument is getting old. It&#39;s not a controlled demolition term. If it was, why would he use it in a edited interview? It&#39;s not like he slipped up in public or anything. He&#39;s more likely talking about pulling any firefighting efforts from the building.</p>

<p>There is no known way to bring a building down in such a controlled way without a ton of explosives going off at once, which would be plainly obvious on all videos of the event. These truthers videos also tend to leave off the actual beginning of the collapse, which is really disingenuous for someone calling themselves a truther.</p>

<p>There is someone who explains how a 47 story building could fall almost into it&#39;s own footprint from a structural failure alone. NIST showed that the failure of any one of a number of joints could have brought down the building. On top of that, the simulations match what actually happened pretty closely.</p>

<p>It seems to me that most people haven&#39;t even looked at what NIST thinks could have happened and just dismisses their work out of hand. It&#39;s really tough to debate someone who hasn&#39;t my side of the argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Problems with the NIST WTC 7 report collapse initiation model and hypothesis</strong></p>

<hr/>

<ol>
<li><p>It ignores the reality that if girder A2001 was heated its lateral movement to the west would have been stopped by column 79’s western side plate restricting the lateral movement of the girder to about 3.7”.</p></li>
<li><p>It omits the ¾” thick x 18” high partial height web stiffeners on the column 79 end of girder A2001 which would prevent the girder’s flange from failing in flexure if the girder’s web could move past the bearing seat.</p></li>
<li><p>It acts as though the girder&#39;s flange would fail as soon as its web was beyond the seat, when in reality the W33 x 130 girder had a rather large 1.18&quot; radius between its web and flange and stress analysis (knowing the girder had a 65 kip load share at its column 79 side of its total 130 kip load ) shows it would not fail until the web was .72&quot; past the seat. This means the travel distance would need to be about 6&quot; to the center of the web with a 12&quot; wide seat + .29 inches to the edge of the .580&quot; thick web + .72&quot; = 7.01&quot;. This is room temperature. At 500C it would fail at 70% of the room temperature stress, which would make the travel distance about 6.87&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>It originally said the girder bearing seat was 11” wide and that the lateral travel to the west was 5.5”. When told the drawing showed a 12” wide girder bearing seat the authors of the report changed the lateral travel to 6.25” but did not say where the additional .75” of travel to the west would come from. The longest beam to the east is K3004 at 53’-8 11/16” and it can only expand a maximum of 5.73” at 654 C, as after that it would shorten more than it will expand, due to sagging.</p></li>
<li><p>It does not consider any expansion to the east where the beams framing into the east wall at columns 38, 39, 40, and 41 have a ¾” space between their ends and the column web. If the shear studs broke on the beams the erection bolts on the beam seats should break and the beams would be free to expand to the east by that ¾” before even contacting the column. This would limit maximum expansion to the west to about 5”.</p></li>
<li><p>It does not consider the reality that if the girder flange did fail the girder could actually only fall onto the 2” thick x 14” deep x 18.875” wide support plate under the 1” thick x 12” wide bearing seat. The support plate would support the load at the girder’s web. In its model of girder A2001’s connection at column 79 it incorrectly uses a single stiffener or T type bearing seat like that at column 81 and girder B2011. The actual situation was a bearing seat with a large support plate spanning the width of the column. See Frankel drawing 9114.</p></li>
<li><p>It denies that there were shear studs on girder A2001, in spite of the 1986 paper by Frankel project manager John Salvarinas which showed there were 30 shear studs on the girder. Colin Bailey of Arup testified to the court in 2009 in the Aegis Insurance Co. vs. WTC 7 Properties case that he had learned there were indeed 30 shear studs on the girder.</p></li>
<li><p>It does not consider any effect from beam P3016 restricting the movement of the girder. Beam P3016 would have had 14 shear studs on it and would have certainly caused the girder to deflect differently than it would if its pivot was at column 44.</p></li>
<li><p>It does not consider any effects of friction from the floor slab on the movement of the beams and girder.</p></li>
<li><p>It omits the lateral support beams framing into beam G3005 and shows that beam buckling when it would not have had the support beams been included in the analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>It does not provide an analysis showing that even if girder A2001 could somehow fall off its seat at column 79 on the 13th floor that it could generate enough force to shear the welds of the support plate on the 12th floor and cause a cascade of floors and leave column 79 unsupported from the north. Analyses by researchers show the impact would only generate about 1/3rd of the force required.</p></li>
<li><p>It does not show analyses for breaking the connections of the other girders framing into column 79 for at least six stories. Column 79 had three girders framing into it (from the north, south, and west) and a column only needs lateral support from two orthogonal directions. It could lose lateral support from either the north or south and still remain stable. Column 79 could also go with no lateral support for five stories. The Arup FEA analysis shows the west and south girder connections remain stable. Arup did try to claim that the connections failed in fracture due to stress raisers in their welds. However, stress raisers are only very local and a large number of cycles are required for a crack to propagate before failing in yield.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>The acceleration of gravity in New York City is 32.159 ft/s2. WTC7 had 2.25 seconds of literal freefall, this is equivalent to approximately 8 stories of fall in which the falling section of the building encountered zero resistance. The collapse was complete in 6.5 seconds. Free-fall time in a vacuum, from Building 7&#39;s roof is 5.96 seconds</p>

<p>For any object to fall at gravitational acceleration, there can be nothing below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance. If there is anything below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance, then not all of the potential energy of the object would be converted to motion and so would not be found falling at gravitational acceleration (where did every single structural supporting columns go, instantly, at the exact same time?)</p>

<p>There&#39;s no exception to that rule, those are the conditions that must exist for gravitational acceleration to occur for the entirety of the duration of the time it occurs, this is basic Newtonian physical principles.</p>

<p>The fact that Building 7 underwent free-fall means that none of the building’s potential energy was used to crush the structure below it. All of its potential energy was converted directly into energy of motion (kinetic energy), leaving no energy to do anything else. Therefore, the lower section of the building could not have been crushed by the falling section. The destruction of at least 8 stories of the lower section of the building had to have been accomplished by other means to allow the upper section of the building to fall through it in free-fall.</p>

<p>Exactly, now you are getting it, the only way was to remove the supports, this is exactly what controlled demolitions do, they can have <em>buckled</em> because that would mean there was some resistance, when we know there was non for 2.25 seconds.</p>

<p>I KNOW it went into absolute free fall because I have personally measure it myself, but this is irrelevant because the claim that WTC7 went into absolute free fall is not in dispute by anyone, not even by NIST.</p>

<p>There is no &quot;margin of error&quot; Galileo demonstrated long ago that any object, of any mass, falling under the influence of gravity alone would accelerate downward at this characteristic rate.</p>
