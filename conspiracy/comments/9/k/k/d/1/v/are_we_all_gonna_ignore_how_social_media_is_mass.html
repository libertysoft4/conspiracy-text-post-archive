        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>YouTube, Twitter (especially Twitter), Google, and many, many others are censoring voices they disagree with to advance their own agenda.</p>

<p>You may have seen that this has recently happened to Alex Jones and Infowars. I don&#39;t think that was an accident.</p>

<p>Many are quick to dismiss Alex and his show as simple crazy conspiracy crap, and this is why he&#39;s been censored first.</p>

<p>He&#39;s an easy target. No mainstream viewer would care, because the general opinion on Jones is that he&#39;s a loony conspiracy-ridden conservative.</p>

<p>And once these companies see that they can slowly take down voices they don&#39;t like, they&#39;ll start censoring mainstream conservatives completely.</p>

<p>All of the Alex Jones stuff was clearly a coordinated assault on him, and these companies, I believe, will now go for even more conservative speakers to further their agenda.</p>

<p>(Also, please do not dismiss my claims by saying I&#39;m just a biased conservative, I&#39;m not actually a conservative, but I felt the need to talk about this in our &quot;free speech&quot; society)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is whether these companies want to be listed as publicly owned or privately owned.  Facebook had this issue a while ago where they were <strong>selectively censoring</strong> certain views which is illegal if they wanted to operate under a certain status.  </p>

<p>It is illegal how they are doing it now, but they are doing it under the guise of &quot;censoring hate speech&quot; while only censoring conservatives.  </p>

<p>They <strong>can</strong> legally censor their sites, but ty would have to operate under a new status which would open them to new lawsuits and other legal issues which is why they try to hide it.  </p>

But then Kavanaugh happened. And the hurricane. And Trump has a habit of facilitating a new crisis once every couple of days either through his tweets or his behavior. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not arguing for or against social media and the supposed censorship of specific voices - just that the assertion it&#39;s never spoken about is inaccurate. It&#39;s the nature of the media. </p>

One piece was a Jewish journalist talking complete shit about Poland refusing immigrants and calling for Nationalism and Sovereignty and that Soros was behind a bunch of bad shit. She basically called them all conspiracy theorists and authoritarians that the EU better do something about.</p>

<p>They&#39;re one of the reasons I realized there is a way bigger slant towards leftist propaganda in mainstream news than conservative.</p>

<p>NPR was supposed to be fair and non biased considering they are tax payer funded but they are as left as left can get in most cases. </p>

<p>There are conservative mainstream media outlets nowadays but 10 or more years ago Fox News was basically the only one that most American&#39;s could access, other than Fox News every MSM was leftist leaning:  MSNBC, CNN, PBS and NPR, NBC, ABC, CBS - all super lefty</p>

<p>The conservative agenda is to permit unlimited consolidation, to permit companies to disinvite people they don&#39;t like, to force workers to contract out of being able to sue, and most importantly, to allow companies to censor all they want.</p>

<p>So there is something fundamentally wrong with the notion that these companies are going to censor conservatives. </p>

<p>The two positions are entirely opposite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not just ignoring it, but asking for it. The government is trying to make it their responsibility to censor user content because of things like pizzagate and the alex jones harrasment of sandy hook families. And the public supports this, at least according to mainstream media.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t understand that you need to allow the bad with the good; otherwise they just redefine what bad is to block whatever they feel like.</p>

Everything was more decentralized and we paid for services with money or trading services instead of using &quot;free, ad-supported&quot; sites for our content.

<p>The name of that 3rd party is the <strong><em>Anti-Defamation League</em></strong> -- and I am FUCKING AMAZED that no one has connected the dots tying all this together -- or if they have, they sure haven&#39;t DARED speak the name.</p>

<p>They have set up a special organization to plot the implementation of this insidious Censorship campaign, and guess what...? </p>

<p>bullshit. there&#39;s like 15 million jews. you really think that 7+ million of them are in dominant positions all over the world? you&#39;re delusional if you do. there just AREN&#39;T that many positions of power out there. &quot;the majority&quot; of them are exactly like you and hold no power whatsoever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A brief excerpt from the court rulings during the civil rights area </p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the heart of the debate is a system of anti-discrimination laws enacted by federal, state and local governments. The entire United States is covered by the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination by privately owned places of public accommodation on the basis of race, color, religion or national origin. Places of “public accommodation” include hotels, restaurants, theaters, banks, health clubs and stores. Nonprofit organizations such as churches are generally exempt from the law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More importantly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, no matter where you live, you cannot deny service to someone because of his or her race, color, religion, national origin or disability. If there is no state, federal or local law prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations against a particular group of people, then you can legally refuse to serve that group of people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no legal standing on discriminating against customers (you&#39;re not the customer here) based on political ideology on a federal level in the United States. Reddit is designed/maintained in San Francisco, which has laws against it, but their parent company is in New York. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/judge-rules-new-york-city-bar-can-refuse-service-to-trump-supporter-wearing-maga-hat">Where a judge recently ruled you can deny service based on political standing</a>. </p>

<p>So the State and Federal Governments is the who, whom says so. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not written in stone, but if you&#39;re really concerned about it, talk to your reps. They can try to pass legislature to federally regulate the internet. Which is a slippery slope. </p>

<p>Private companies regulating their websites =/= censorship. </p>

<p>But if the federal government was to pass legislature to regulate what you can and cannot say on the internet, you get to a slippery slope pretty damn fast. They just have to put in a small footnote saying &quot;you can&#39;t talk shit on the military, federal agents, or any legislative branch&quot; and boom. 1984 level censorship. You can&#39;t question any administration, whether Democrat or Republican. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>according to the ACLU, the government held closed-door meetings with media companies to determine what or what is not acceptable</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That’s why the ACLU is concerned that the federal government — in the name of counterterrorism — is pressuring social media companies to limit content on platforms that hundreds of millions of people use every day.</p>

<p>It is not the government’s place to determine the course of the political and social conversations that are happening on services like Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube. Nor can the government do an end-run around the First Amendment’s strong protections for online speech by seeking to influence it through other means.</p>

<p>But that’s the disturbing pattern that seems to be emerging. The government has held multiple closed door meetings with social media executives and has suggested that services take steps to create government-friendly content, monitor activity, and even tweak algorithms to change the availability of certain posts and users. As we wrote earlier this year, social media companies should decline such invitations to join the national security state.</p>

<p>At the same time, the social media companies provide little to no transparency about how often they take down content for violations of the rules in their own terms of service, which are prone to enforcement errors and abuse. Such rules typically restrict speech on the platforms in ways that go beyond what the government can restrict under the First Amendment. That raises questions about whether the government may be using the rules to pressure companies to take down content that the government itself could not.</p>

<p>IMO, the government has been trying to influence media companies to curb freedom of speech because otherwise people would be up in arms if they did it outright.

<p>I never once said that there isn&#39;t a challenge in talking to people about conspiracies they have not heard of or do not believe to be true.</p>

<p>I have experienced first hand that some people have trouble trying to present a conspiracy theory to other people in a believable and nonaggressive way. I was insulting the above poster with my comment. They said that they are banned in multiple places on the internet, and in their real life are considered the crazy conspiracy person. They also said they felt hopeless and like giving up. I was just suggesting that they reflect on how they are presenting their information and see if that could be a part of the issue.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a conservative argument that if someone owns a company they do not owe people equal access to their services. They rightly stood by the decision not to force a Christian bakery to bake a gay wedding cake. If we were to take up this fight against censorship legally, it would be conservatives arguing with us that we can&#39;t legally force the owners of those companies to violate their terms of service. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not for those who break the rules, it wouldn&#39;t be so advanced and quick if it was, it&#39;s for those who don&#39;t go along with whatever the platform wants you to go along with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been asking simple questions to people about it like...</p>

<p>&quot;So now that PayPal has shown they will also refuse Alex to use their services what&#39;s next? I guess his cell phone provider, power company, ISP provider can all do the same right? They are indeed private companies.&quot;</p>

<p>There is a shut down effect at that point. The PayPal thing seems to strike a nerve. Then I also add absolutely no bank In America has to provide you any services or credit card processors. Banks have always been able to discriminate.</p>

<p>This has happened to gun dealers, Kratom and botanical shops have an absolute nightmare trying to use anything other than bitcoin. Cannibas also.</p>

<p>The IRS on record targeted people for their political beliefs. That&#39;s now an admitted conspiracy.</p>

<p>Its the same ol same ol. &quot;oh that will never happen&quot;</p>

<p>Yea I remember people laughing so hard at any mention Alex would be banned from social media years ago when I predicted it was coming &quot;Noway!!!, he&#39;s a cook, he makes them revenue!!! Bla bla&quot;</p>

<p>Yea those same people have gotten really pissy when I mention it happened and of course are more worried about being wrong than admitting this is a serious concern. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the same time, the social media companies provide little to no transparency about how often they take down content for violations of the rules in their own terms of service, which are prone to enforcement errors and abuse. Such rules typically restrict speech on the platforms in ways that go beyond what the government can restrict under the First Amendment. That raises questions about whether the government may be using the rules to pressure companies to take down content that the government itself could not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m much more concerned that the media is going to be censoring actually leftist opinions. I mean, I feel bad that conservatives are getting censored. Any censorship is bad. </p>

<p>But the answers to the worlds problems cannot be solved by conservatives, if anything you’ll just reinforce the global banking system that keeps up the facade of a “free world”, while like 10 people could literally change the trajectory of the world just to suit their own interest. </p>

<p>I mean, name one conservative that is for punishing multi national corporations and banks for the rape of the third world. </p>

<p>Yeah, being “nationalistic” might take the manufacturing jobs away from sweatshops. But it doesn’t do anything to the slavery and hard labor of the raw materials that manufacturing jobs acquire to use. It doesn’t stop the world banks from forcibly lending money to countries, just to make them their colonies. </p>

<p>Actual leftists see this, and will always be censored. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What can you do about it? A private organization&#39;s want to censor speech is not against our protected rights.   </p>

<p>The only way to fix it is to get people to migrate to a free speech platform. However, people are now complacent. I would not be surprised if the government is behind it as a social experiment and will soon start rolling out their control system. No one will bat an eye. Freedom of expression and speech will disappear over night.   </p>

<p>The conservative agenda is to permit unlimited consolidation, to permit companies to disinvite people they don&#39;t like, to force workers to contract out of being able to sue, and most importantly, to allow companies to censor all they want.</p>

<p>So there is something fundamentally wrong with the notion that these companies are going to censor conservatives. </p>

<p>The two positions are entirely opposite.</p>
