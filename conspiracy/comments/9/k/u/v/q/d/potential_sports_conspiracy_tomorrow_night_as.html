<p>Nobody in TV or the League wants to the Oakland A&#39;s advance.  The options are Boston vs NY or Boston vs Oakland.  The East Coast is Die.Ing. for their circle jerk. IF a game is to be scripted, it&#39;s this one, and you can watch it happen in real time.</p>

<p>This game is likely too high-profile to be fixed by Vegas or a rogue group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is easier to predict national championship contenders based on recent localized disasters, natural or otherwise, versus ratings. Someone with a timeline could do some research and prove me wrong. If I see two teams in the finals of football, baseball, basketball or hockey, I look for at least one city with a recent disaster, and I usually find one. Golden State was the better team last year, but they also had the Napa fires (who set that?). They were playing Houston in the semis, coming off of their hurricane, but the Astros won the World Series last year. The Bosox won after the Marathon bombing. Atlanta won after the Olympic Park bombing. New Orleans after Katrina. I thought the new Las Vegas Hockey team was going to beat the Caps for this reason, but hey I like Ovetchkin so I was cool with that result, but LV was in the finals in their first year of existence, the feel good story of hockey after the feel bad story went radio silent...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats pretty laughable. Football is the easiest of all of those. Hockey, basketball and football all have referee objectionable calls. In baseball, the only thing left that is up to an umpire is balls and strikes, and throwing someone out of the game.

    <div class="md"><p>you simply cant script Judge launching bombs. Well maybe he can, but not the MLB. If you wanna make claims about what athletes they target with drug testing and which ones they let get by, thats one thing. Baseball doesnt have enough umpire interaction for them to reliably control the outcomes. Especially not in a one game playoff. In football, there is arguably a penalty on every single play, so they can call things whenever the fuck they want. </p>
