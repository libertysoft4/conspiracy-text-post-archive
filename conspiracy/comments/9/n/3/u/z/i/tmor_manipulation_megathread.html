Many folks have suggested making a thread to start compiling evidence of the sustained attack against the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> community being carried out by <a href="/r/TopMindsofReddit">/r/TopMindsofReddit</a> and similar hate subs.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9mm41r/the_final_truth_of_russiagate_as_the_hoax/e7g8zd0/">this comment of mine</a> was aggressively targeted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/9mpheq/mueller_is_a_corrupt_as_fuck_deep_state_stooge/">by those participating in this TMOR thread</a>, resulting in a comment score of below -350, which is <em>unheard of</em> (by many orders of magnitude) when dealing with a normal <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> thread with negligible visibility.</p>

<p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9mzsk4/rampant_manipulation_tmor_brigades_a_comment_in_a/">when I called them out for this stalkerish behavior</a> they responded they only way they know how: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9mzsk4/rampant_manipulation_tmor_brigades_a_comment_in_a/">with further brigades</a>.</p>

<p>Please take this opportunity to share your stories of abuse perpetrated by these vile individuals.</p>

<p>They are cockroaches. Let&#39;s break out the spotlight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When someone bullies someone else because they have a crush on them. This is usually because they aren&#39;t sure how to convey their feelings properly. Often the bully is a Type A Tsundere. The target of the bullying is generally under the impression that the bully is simply mean and has no clue the bully has a crush on them.</p>

<p>Look at this post, and where it stands at this point. Even the most controversial shit doesn&#39;t have this many comments to a 12+ upvoted post (at this moment).</p>

<p>It seems that the sheer mention if TMOR causes this subreddit to react violently, any idea why that may be?</p>

<p>Based on any post, that doesn&#39;t involve partisan interests.</p>

<p>The stark differences between threads that are not linked to TMOR and threads like this and the Banksy one yesterday.</p>

<p>It&#39;s literal willful ignroance to believe that those two posts have natural vote counts.</p>

<p>Also, I get people don&#39;t like RMFN and Axotl, but holy shit you can go down to one or their comments (you know when it gets to that point in a discussion where no one else reads because of the &#39;continue thread here&#39;s type notice) and see that they are hassled to the point that benign comments agreeing with a thread is downvoted massively for them.</p>

<p>They are literally the only two users who make a vocal effort against TMOR and TMOR have a self-proclaimed nazihunting boner for em, unless you can somehow convince me that those users are doing it to themselves to make a subreddit dedicated to making fun of us look bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a conspiracy there.</p>

<p>The &#39;official story&#39; is that Banksy and Banksy alone rigged the painting frame to shred the painting.</p>

<p>The mystery surrounding how this was accomplished added to the art and actually <em>raised the value of the painting</em>.</p>

<p>If indeed Sotheby&#39;s orchestrated it, yet publicly claimed that they had no foreknowledge of the event, then not only is it a conspiracy, but it is <em>fraud, to the tune of $9 million</em></p>

<p>This was a complete <em>whoosh</em> to the TMOR users. The thread title that links to that thread treats it like the linked thread was just stating the obvious.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Top mind realizes Banksy set up the painting shredding incident, after hours of research indicating that picture frames do not usually contain paper shredders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It makes no reference to the fact that the linked post is alleging <em>Sotheby&#39;s</em> knew about the shredding event beforehand. Not Banksy.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if TMOR is actually run like National Enquirer&#39;s whole &quot;catch and kill&quot; scam where the mods are willing to accept money to squash specific stories.</p>

<p>Of course, their 100,000 subscribers wouldn&#39;t know that. They are just NPCs lured in by the fact that its easier to bully conspiracy theorist to ease ones cognitive dissonance than it is to resolve it by genuine morbid curiosity.</p>

<p>There close to 3k subscribers of this sub online. If they&#39;re sorting by new as they were instructed, maybe that&#39;s why stupid stuff gets downvoted right away.</p>

<p>Unintended consequences are a thing.  Just like stickying yet another post about &#39;real conspiracy users&#39; brigading this sub.  </p>

<p>Making threads artificially sticky so they&#39;re not &#39;artificially&#39; downvoted is a sure way to attract downvotes.  Also, it&#39;s clearly trying to drive an invented narrative.  It&#39;s a self fulfilling prophecy.</p>

As though there was a considerate way to suggest that you were a waste of air. Still, let me give it a try: &quot;Dear Sir, While I hesitate to suggest extreme measures, pondering the conundrum of the massive gap between your actual person and your opinion of your faculties has led me to the invariable conclusion that this realm would be substanatively improved by your self-induced departure from it.&quot; </p>

<p>Q threads fell victim to this systematic manipulation, so stickied threads often help elevate this conversations above the fray.</p>

<p>I see absolutely no evidence that mods are trying to stop the TMOR brigading. It&#39;s undeniable that r/conspiracy has been under a sustained attack...I&#39;ve messaged mods about posts that were beyond obvious they were being brigaded and I was told to &quot;prove it&quot;...when it was as obvious as the fucking sunrise the post was brigaded and rendered useless.  </p>

<p>We are! We can do so with more frequency...I see no problem with that.</p>

<p>We are <em>definitely</em> doing this, and have been for years.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, reddit is very broken.</p>

<p>Even if you ban someone, they can <em>still</em> vote on the subreddit they&#39;ve been banned from.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a frighteningly stupid oversight that leads to all manners of abuse and manipulation.</p>

<p>AFAIK, there is nothing the mods can do about this.</p>

<p>I believe the admins allow this because they appear to condone this behavior.</p>

We should also trust that the FBI director of 8 years (mueller) is a good guy but he&#39;s just doing his best to protect America </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I feel like a lot of your anti-meuller</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve been around the conspiracy community long enough to know that Mueller has <em>long</em> been suspected of skulduggery and all manners of malfeasance since he started his position at the head of the FBI <em>right</em> before 9/11 and then presided over the anthrax &quot;investigation&quot;, which has even been acknowledged to have been botched by the mainstream.</p>

<p>So yeah, there&#39;s traditionally no love lost for Mueller among conspiracy researchers. </p>

<p>One of the more impressive tricks they&#39;ve pulled is getting folks to believe, often aggressively, that distrust for Mueller equates with support for Trump, which brings me to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>your pro-trump stuff</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What &quot;pro-trump&quot; stuff are you referring to? I post tons of articles, but rarely take a stance on anything political. </p>

<p>One of the many unexpected outcomes of Trump&#39;s presidency was that all of the sudden many conspiracy theorists were assumed to be Trump supporters, and there appears to be a sustained propaganda effort to keep that misconception alive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>as head mod, it&#39;s really not right that you take such a opinion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So let me get this straight...a moderator of a <em>conspiracy</em> forum shouldn&#39;t be allowed to call into question the integrity of the head of a government agency? Did I get that right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You should help foster an environment where all conspiracies are welcome</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod team is dedicated to precisely this, and we are doing everything in our power to ward off those bad actors who are attempting to prevent a healthy environment to discuss any and all conspiracies.</p>

<p>Mueller has long been suspected of skulduggery and all manners of malfeasance</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, instead of having real opposition like Kenneth Starr and Brett Kavanaugh when they went after Bill Clinton, Donald Trump gets a Republican cohort who agrees with DJT&#39;s policy. They speak ill of each other, but that&#39;s just for show. It&#39;s a very simple conspiracy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>right before 9/11</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right before 9-11, the people who populated the illegitimate George W. Bush administration at the highest levels were members of  PNAC -- the ultimate conspiracy of our times. PNAC, in its 2000 document &quot;Rebuilding America&#39;s Defenses,&quot; ordered more money for the military, attacks upon the Middle East including Iran, and an independent &quot;Space Force.&quot;</p>

<p>Donald Trump called the Iraq invasion a &quot;disaster,&quot; then went on to vote for GWB in 2004 because he liked the tax cuts. So much for being against war. Just give billionaires or apparent billionaires larger tax refunds and the million or more killed according to the Orb study is a fair trade off.</p>

<p>Many of these PNAC people and these exact policies are being carried forward by Donald Trump, as so-called establishment Republicans whine and complain but never bother to use their power to actually take action. Rather, they refuse to pass a simple bill to try to stop Donald Trump from firing the special investigator -- because they trust Donald Trump? That&#39;s unbelievably transparent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;all of the sudden&quot; many conspiracy theorists were assumed to be Trump supporters,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People who support TPTB when the minority party -- the party of oligarchy for over a hundred years straight -- takes monopolistic power of the government against the people -- and suspiciously so in every area -- House, Senate, White House and even Supreme Court. In a conspiracy sub, this is exactly the opposite of what is expected -- and in dire opposition to the way conspiracy boards were during GWB and during Barack Obama.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Donald Trump is an establishment Republican LARP, a fake outsider. TPTB are consolidating quickly and dangerously under their government of plutocrats.</p>

<p>With the sheer amount of attacks leveled against <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and its users on a daily basis...that would be assuredly unwise. </p>

<p>Read the testimony of the genuine users in this thread who aren&#39;t attempt to deflect with partisan political nonsense...TMOR is harassing folks to the point that many of the genuine contributors have had enough and simply left.</p>

<p>When they repeatedly are brigading harmless comments to the negative <em>hundreds</em>--something that violates the very core ethos of this website--I would be shocked if the mods of said sub <em>weren&#39;t</em> extremely vocal about what was occurring.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to, but it would probably be better for the subreddit as a whole if moderators kept their &quot;usertalk&quot; to alt user accounts and not recognizable mod accounts.</p>

One of the mods of that brigade sub has apparently been banned, one&#39;s account no longer exists, and the other is still a very active user here. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll go on record and state that u/axolotl_peyotl is an incredible moderator and has clearly been the victim of a smear campaign. There should be more bans for people coming here to be generally negative about conspiracies, and there is nothing in his comment history to suggest truth to the radical alt-right picture they are trying to paint.

    <div class="md"><p>Evidence is in the numbers. Doesn&#39;t mean you are going to understand it. </p>

<p>Look at the number of comments marked controversial.</p>

<p>Controversial means an equal number of upvotes and downvotes.</p>

<p>An upvote to cancel every downvote. </p>

<p>When the whole thread is controversial, it is evidence of shenanigans.</p>

<p>But again, many will be quick to say &quot;that&#39;s not evidence&quot;.</p>

<p>Some get it, some don&#39;t. </p>

<p>Just because something isn&#39;t as popular or accepted as you think it should be doesn&#39;t mean its shilling.</p>

<p>Maybe the idea&#39;s in the thread are simply unpopular ideas.</p>

<p>Read my comment again. I definitely didn&#39;t think you were shilling, and wasn&#39;t accusing you, but now I&#39;m not so sure... </p>

<p>Also, you clearly don&#39;t even know what a comment marked as controversial means, or the implication of ALL comments being marked controversial.</p>

<p>Its beyond me the hypocrisy of TMOR they always find a way to excuse their actions.... if the admins. Haven&#39;t stepped in at this point they are condoning their actions and have no intention to do a damn thing about it.</p>

(Kinda like MSN, kinda no diff here) The REAL problem is that reddit, twho ought to sort it out but they are aspiring to be MSM and so just lets it play on without an endgame... is all in favor of this double brigading of this sub, because for all extensive purposes it makes sense to them to have this specific baseline of users maintain modicum level of paranoia, which is how they desire to see the spirit of this community to continue. The OP and all those people he&#39;s attacking and all those people who rush to his defense and all those people who attack them, it&#39;s artificial and it&#39;s not very intrlligent... they are all full of the dankiest shazam you ever smelt.</p>

<p>Clear and systematic campaign of harassment against specific Reddit Users, in this case YOU, u/RMFN are being systematically targeted by the mod u/MAGA_Hatter; that is coordinated harassment via one of the MODS of TMOR...and indicates that the Subreddit TMOR actually classifies and targets individual reddit users in a coordinated campaign of intimidation, prejudice (their religious beliefs also; see his title of the OP mocking you) and harassment.</p>

<p>I have archived the subreddit and downloaded the zip showing your post on the front page of TMOR along with this image of TMOR with your post on it. Use all the photos here...including the one at the top to prove your case (because this is now centered around you)...</p>

<p>I have been dehumanized by the bigotry of <a href="/u/maga_hatter">/u/maga_hatter</a>. They&#39;re intolerance to my religious and political beliefs have made me feel unsafe to freely discus my opinions. This post is to point out the fact that that kind of bigotry is allowed on reddit. I see the ideological of hatred against diverse opinions is the most important conspiracy we OK reddit have to tackle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you really want to make a difference, here is my suggestion:</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I unsubbed here months ago because, in my observation, certain mods are, perhaps unwittingly, helping the brigades. There are two or three here that consistently lay the hammer down hard on actual members while allowing disrupters to keep breaking the rules. Sure, you look in the mod logs and they remove the comments, but those people just keep getting to comment away over and over. They are not being banned, while real members are getting banned for pushing back.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>So, anyway... I am unsubbed. I am not subscribed to this sub anymore. Yet, here I am able to not only comment but able to up and downvote in the threads. Stop allowing that and a significant portion of the brigading would stop. Anyone from anywhere on reddit can vote on the comments here without ever participating in the sub. Other subs prohibit this, so it can be done. It won&#39;t stop all brigading, because some people will subscribe to do it, but it will make it much harder.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Why are people allowed to comment and vote while not being a subscriber? I know previously, the mods probably couldn&#39;t control this because the top mod was absent. But after the recent changeover, this should be possible.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I realize one of those mods might ban me over this comment, but that&#39;s ok. I actually DO care what is happening to the community here. But consider this: Instead of banning me, disallow commenting and votes from non-subscribers and I wouldn&#39;t even be able to comment here. No need to ban to silence me. You can look in my post history. I have been a target of TMOR and have consistently called out the brigading in this sub.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Good luck</p>

<p>Honestly this is a <em>huge</em> factor in the manipulation and I actually don&#39;t think we can do anything about it.</p>

<p>That said, can we just openly start banning people who post in that subreddit unironically or in any way that isn&#39;t defending this one? I don&#39;t see any reason not to.</p>

<p>You realize that totes would be triggered by <em>every</em> sub that posts here.</p>

<p>Many small subs automatically link to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> on a daily basis...there would be a totes comment in almost every thread. </p>

<p>I could see this getting abused quickly too...anyone could start promoting their sub by simply linking to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and they&#39;d get a free link to their sub in our space.</p>

<p>I honestly think the policy is good as it stands, but if you&#39;d like, feel free to start a new thread with this petition so we can have a broader discussion.</p>

<p>Personally I&#39;d be most concerned with users here following the np links and causing trouble in other subs, thereby possibly giving an excuse to crackdown on the sub. I&#39;m convinced a rationale can always be found on an as needed basis if we&#39;re considered too much of a liability, though</p>

<p>I appreciate the time, effort, and stressful moments you and the other mods must use to keep this community running, AP, which is a big part of why I would not wish to moderate such a large and controversial sub myself.</p>

It&#39;s a fucking joke, and you&#39;re worried about promoting other subs? Fixing our troll infestation is priority #1. At this point I&#39;m not even interested in discussing potential abuse of totes messenger. I have made, in the past, at least three new threads with my ideas on fixing things but you guys are so fun shy to implement anything I&#39;m fucking done.  What are you worried about? A thread calling the mods facsists? Calling for you to step down? Downvoted brigaded? Because if you haven&#39;t noticed that&#39;s going to happen anyway.  People are making a career out of trolling your sub.  It&#39;s infuriating to regular users.  &quot;Feel free to make a thread petitioning for totes messenger&quot;, I mean, that just makes it all the more infuriating. Those threads have been made ad nauseum. Let&#39;s take some steps. Ban all of them. Petition the admins DAILY. Enable totes. Scratch rule 10 or make it apply to those who are only here to troll. You know the difference. Lay down the law, the worst that can happen is already an everyday ocxurance here.</p>

<p>This user was directing brigades by linking to us five, and as many as eight times a day, <strong>for months on end</strong>, as well as tagging myself and other regulars also multiple times a day, also for months on end, using derogatory title alterations, and Reddit would do nothing about it after banning his earlier account for harassment.</p>

<p>So I gave a small number of his comments a downvote. No link, no brigade, just a single downvote on especially egregious and slanderous comments.</p>

<p>A thousands links and tags from him, and I downvoted him 25 times over the course of that year. That&#39;s less than one a month. I was banned for it. Yet he wasn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Referring to <strong>my own experience</strong>, R conspiracy threads are getting downvoted when they involve subjects, the FBI, the NSA and CIA do have interest in. </p>

<p>For example some of my threads, where I myself experienced downvoting:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/8f2ms2/is_president_donald_trump_still_under_fbi/">https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/8f2ms2/is_president_donald_trump_still_under_fbi/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/90pe5o/putins_kompromat_on_trump/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/90pe5o/putins_kompromat_on_trump/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/96go23/lockheedmartin_will_finish_his_gamechanging/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/96go23/lockheedmartin_will_finish_his_gamechanging/</a></p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>It was always like this, my thread had 20 upvotes, and within 15 minutes or they were reduced to 3 or 5.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>It is pretty obvious, who might have an interest to do so ...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha yeah.  I still contend reddit is heavily manipulated, but it really is impossible to tell without logs, or seeing something blatantly obvious like a -15 in a single refresh.  Oftentimes reddit will even reset downvotes as their own algorithm can tell spam scripts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>It is pretty obvious</strong>, that this thread - like many other threads in R conspiracy before - (and even the new comments in this thread) <strong>really are effected by manipulative downvoting!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Thus, we should focus on how we can deal with this situation,  now!</strong>  (instead of complaining about this bad situation only)</p>

<p>What we need to do this, is an <strong>effective counter-measure, that is within the reddit netiquette</strong> (the rules reddit has set up for participation in the reddit platform).</p>

<p>From my point of view the best counter-measure to neutralize manipulative downvoting would be <strong>frequent &quot;Manipulative Down-Voting Watcher Threads&quot;</strong>, that enumerate and link the cases, where manipulative down-voting has been applied. </p>

<p>For good and neutral information it should be policy to mention manipulative down-voting cases in other people&#39;s threads, only, because sometime one is simply wrong and may prematurely think, that the voting may be manipulated (which is not always the case).</p>

<p>What do you think about this proposal?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But weren&#39;t we specifically told in another stickied thread to always sort by &#39;new&#39;?</p>

<p>There close to 3k subscribers of this sub online. If they&#39;re sorting by new as they were instructed, maybe that&#39;s why stupid stuff gets downvoted right away.</p>

<p>Unintended consequences are a thing.  Just like stickying yet another post about &#39;real conspiracy users&#39; brigading this sub.  </p>

<p>Making threads artificially sticky so they&#39;re not &#39;artificially&#39; downvoted is a sure way to attract downvotes.  Also, it&#39;s clearly trying to drive an invented narrative.  It&#39;s a self fulfilling prophecy.</p>

<p>Just because something isn&#39;t as popular or accepted as you think it should be doesn&#39;t mean its shilling.</p>

<p>Maybe the idea&#39;s in the thread are simply unpopular ideas.</p>

<p>Ha, in your last comment did you accuse me of shilling?</p>

<p>to complain about the general attitudes of the majority of posters on this board is silly. it would be like a libertarian setting his home at latestagecapitalism and complaining about the community and trying to change the culture of that subreddit.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>funny, the lefty boards seem to be muuuuch more banhappy than places like this, and yet lefties complain about this subreddit and the people contributing to it</p>
