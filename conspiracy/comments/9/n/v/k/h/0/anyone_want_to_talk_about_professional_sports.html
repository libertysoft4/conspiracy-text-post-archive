I’m someone who has looked into this stuff and professional sports are all like the WWE to me and they appear to have predetermined outcomes. When you see an extremely talented player just stop playing for the most part it becomes pretty apparent. I could go into more detail on the comments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See people say “rigged”, I look at the evidence and it appears to me that professional athletes are told who will win the game and they play it out as they are paid to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/U7rPIg7ZNQ8">This</a> is another great example. The Seahawks losing the Super Bowl by throwing an interception when they had Marshawn Lynch running all over the other teams defense. And I’m saying this as someone who disposed that team. They threw that game because the Patriots where supposed to win.</p>

<p>It was second down with 25 seconds and 1 timeout remaining.  If the hawks ran the ball and got stuffed,  they would have been forced to burn their last time out,  leaving them on third down with zero timeouts where they would have absolutely no choice but to pass the ball.  </p>

It was obvious to me from <strong>numbers on the surface</strong> — no calculator required — that Toronto would win.  Toronto swept.  Meanwhile ZH went on a vicious and unprovoked anti Semitic tirade against the jaysblog author who had linked to him.
So check it out, sure.  But that asshole is addicted to calculators because they are ambiguous.</p>

Along with practically giving Jimmie Johnson 7 Cup Championships, which is ironically, the same number of championships that Petty and Earnhardt won. He maybe a good driver but no where near #43 and #3.</p>

I have a feeling the NBA Finals will end up being Lakers vs Celtics and it might become a normal occurrence as a re-has of the old rivalry. Bird vsMagic will become Irving vs Lebron. If you have payed attention, the commentators in the past few years have made it a point to say “Stop comparing Lebron to Jordan, he is more like Magic in the way he plays.” Hmmm....</p>

<p>The refs/umps can get away with this in a ton of ways--calling penalties (many of which could be called on any play of a football game) is one of the ways they do this.  The momentum of a game can be shifted by doing this at opportune moments in the game.  </p>

<p>I really wouldn&#39;t doubt if umps/refs get a briefing before each game--they know what to do to extend a series or cut a lead (don&#39;t want a lobsided game--bad ratings)...</p>

<p>I disagree with that notion.  Not that hockey is too small to be fixed, but that bigger leagues are much harder to fix.  There is way too much money already involved for people to risk it.  Owners aren&#39;t going to go along with it because it could cost them hundreds of millions of dollars.  Players are getting paid way more than they could make doing something else.  It&#39;s much smaller leagues where you see fixing going.  Smaller soccer leagues, lower division college games.  Even e-sports has had problems with match fixing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do have to consider that an athlete can lose his prime even when he is young (ie. Tyson lost it in his 30&#39;s, and so did Roy Jones after getting brutally knocked out by Tarver), and that could play a role in out-of-character performances. In combat sports you will see a lot of newer/casual fans that can&#39;t understand that, and will claim a fight was fixed (ie. Ronda Rousey, or Anderson Silva losing), when a fighter under-performs. Watching combat sports actually takes some skill, so I understand that casual fans have a limited understanding of what they are looking at (I was new to these sports at one time also, obviously). But yeah, an athlete still has the ability to take a dive.</p>

<p>You know, human error could be easily reduced in a lot of these pro sports, especially with the tech available now. Take the umps out of baseball. GPS chips in the football.

I don&#39;t think the outcomes are completely fixed as you you would need everybody in every team all on the same page. 
What can be done with minimal risk is to alter the likelihood of an outcome. That&#39;s very easily achieved by having just a single player having an &#39;off&#39; day.

<p>Still not big enough to be fixed. </p>

<p>I disagree with that notion.  Not that hockey is too small to be fixed, but that bigger leagues are much harder to fix.  There is way too much money already involved for people to risk it.  Owners aren&#39;t going to go along with it because it could cost them hundreds of millions of dollars.  Players are getting paid way more than they could make doing something else.  It&#39;s much smaller leagues where you see fixing going.  Smaller soccer leagues, lower division college games.  Even e-sports has had problems with match fixing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In australia there is one journo  that is on every election telecast  and also when there is a big breaking political story.  He wears a different  tie every day . So last election a betting agency  took bets on what tie he would wear out of 4 colours. Someone told him so he changed ties 4 ties and they had to pay out to everyone who bet on it </p>
