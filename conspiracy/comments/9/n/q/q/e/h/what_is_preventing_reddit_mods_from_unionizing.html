<p>Unions are cancer. Change my mind...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll try.</p>

<p>People think unions are really bad but they&#39;re the major reason why the US developed a healthy middle class.</p>

<p>Back during the great recession, employers were taking advantage of workers who had no rights, so workers organized, formed unions, and went on strike to fight for their rights.</p>

<p>By the time the 50s rolled around, the US was in a great economic position, people were living that American Dream lifestyle purely because workers united.</p>

<p>The upper class wasn&#39;t as wealthy. CEOs only made 20-50 times what workers made. Nowadays, CEOs can make 200-500 times what they pay regular workers.</p>

<p>Unions are great for the working class. It&#39;s what makes sure you et paid fairly for your work.</p>

<p>Most of them are jumped up idiots, nuking mass amounts comments and threads for the sake of it. ‘Modding for the sake of modding’.</p>

<p>It’s gone to their heads even with the simpler things now. These days it’s almost impossible to make a post in a lot of subreddits because of the ever growing slot of rules these morons add to their territory.  Rule after rule after rule and, even if you get through, it will be heavily moderated by all their fab new tools.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know they do, I&#39;m a mod. I don&#39;t want to be paid, nor do I want the risk/responsibility that comes with it, if I was contractually obliged to Reddit.  </p>

<p>I mod subs that I want to. I do it, because I want to, and care for them. It&#39;s a trade off. They take most of the responsibility and I have a platform. It&#39;s voluntary. </p>

<p>There is little to no risk for me, as a mod who mods a legit/legal community. </p>

<p>This whole thread is nonsense, IMO. </p>

<p>Unions are cancer. Change my mind...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll try.</p>

<p>People think unions are really bad but they&#39;re the major reason why the US developed a healthy middle class.</p>

<p>Back during the great recession, employers were taking advantage of workers who had no rights, so workers organized, formed unions, and went on strike to fight for their rights.</p>

<p>By the time the 50s rolled around, the US was in a great economic position, people were living that American Dream lifestyle purely because workers united.</p>

<p>The upper class wasn&#39;t as wealthy. CEOs only made 20-50 times what workers made. Nowadays, CEOs can make 200-500 times what they pay regular workers.</p>

<p>Unions are great for the working class. It&#39;s what makes sure you et paid fairly for your work.</p>
