<blockquote>
<p>Former neoconservative luminary Francis Fukuyama of Stanford (formerly of Johns Hopkins) compares the neoconservative movement to Leninism. Neoconservatism, according to Fukuyama, is the reincarnation to some extent of both Leninism and Bolshevism.</p>

<p>Fukuyama’s observation makes sense when even Irving Kristol, who founded the movement, proudly admitted that the “honor I most prized was the fact that I was a member in good standing of the [Trotskyist] Young People’s Socialist League (Fourth International).”</p>

<p>And this neoconservative movement, as Jewish writer Sidney Blumenthal has shown, found its political and intellectual ideology “in the disputatious heritage of the Talmud.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the same set of interests that were behind 9/11 as well: zionists, mossad, the Likud party and the various machinery they&#39;ve spawned over the last few decades.</p>

<p>Always, the ZOG wants the US to fight its wars in the Middle East. </p>

<p>Robert Baer, the former CIA field officer and author, once said that Iranians are the natural allies to the Americans. They&#39;re smart, reasonable, the largest country in the region, never been occupied by a foreign power, and conflict with them would be catastrophic to the world economy.</p>

<p>It makes sense that we should be allied with the Iranians. Powerful forces want the US and Iran to remain at odds with each other. </p>

<p>You know the thing people point to when asked why they don&#39;t like Iranians? The hostage crisis. Where no one even died. Held by students--before we really had minted the word &quot;terrorist&quot;. That event still colors our politics. As does our ousting of Mosaddegh for the Shah. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also think there is some oil game is going around with Iran, Venezuela and, may be, Russia to some extent. </p>

<p>My theory is that this will be last big cycle for the oil, as peak oil demand is expected to hit in the next decade. And countries would be better off offloading as much as oil possible in the high of the cycle. </p>

<p>Also, Saudi&#39;s want to offload some oil exposure via Armaco ipo as oil prices were down but now given the cycle is picking they have postponed it to 21. </p>

<p>I think all the current geopolitical issues Venezuela, Qatar, Iran, to some extent Russia are all related to oil.</p>

<p>Oil is still ruling the geopolitics close to century.</p>
