        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Something I’ve been thinking about... These days there seems to be a complete lack of any person who society would deem a celebrated “genius.” Stephen Hawking would be the last one that comes to mind. </p>

<p>Even people like bill gates and Elon musk are more celebrated for the amount of money they have rather than how they are helping to advance society. Perhaps this is an attempt to stifle public understanding of modern scientific achievement, along with an attempt to shift the idea of success to individual gain rather than the amount of contribution to social progress. </p>

<p>Whatever the case, it is important to understand both how and why certain people are idolized, and recognize the characteristics that are being emulated in order to shape your own morals accordingly. Ask yourself what is truly important to <em>you</em> not to the people you see online and on tv (if you still watch). Thank you for reading</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, my point is about how he’s portrayed publicly, though. We hear a fraction about what gates is doing compared to the kardashians on a weekly basis. I bet a majority of Americans couldn’t even tell you what gates has been doing the last ten years. Tyson is a celebrity masked as a genius, being famous for dumbing down science to a third grade level of understanding. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, I think the first part of your comment necessitates the need for the second part of your comment. If most people are on the level of the Kardashians then it might be beneficial to have somebody dumbing-down science for the general population. But this conversation is kind of hijacking your topic.</p>

<p>Science became political. If you believe in science (which is a crazy statement in itself) you&#39;re more likely a liberal and if you think science is bullshit you probably voted for Trump. I think this is why your original question can be asked today. Carl Sagan was popular generally. I don&#39;t think that be possible today. He&#39;d probably be considered a liberal hero.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a huge fan of Tyson, but trust me, he&#39;s no genius. He&#39;s an advocate and an educator, but by no measure whatsoever is he a genius. In broad-topic, long-form interviews, when asked to explain BASIC CONCEPTS related to quantum theory and quantum mechanics, I&#39;ve seen him give completely wrong answers (after repeated yet unsuccessful attempts at dodging the questions) but look totally convincing and confident, all in his signature animated style. And at the &quot;are we living in a simulation&quot; debate at the museum of natural history last year, he grossly misinterpreted one of the panelist&#39;s ideas on &quot;error-correcting codes&quot; as being general, all-purpose &quot;computer code&quot;, causing the audience and millions of youtubers to think that at the smallest of scales, I.e. Planck scale, that the universe is nothing more than computer code. He&#39;s a good PR man for space and science, thats about it. Don&#39;t expect any groundbreaking ideas to come out of his mouth anytime soon.</p>

<p>Oh and his books are basic af. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There used to be a time when viral sensational content or identities couldn&#39;t simply be purchased. What you consider a genius needs to be on the world stage to count, right? Prior to our current connectivity, renown was earned, not purchased. </p>

<p>Presently, if your father is simply a third generation jewish banker, you have the option to become a world renowned celebrity for whichever entertainment purpose you desire. An idot, a hero, an influencer of billions. For Taylor Swift, the choice was music. For others it may be acting or sports performance. </p>

<p>I am not saying that these examples are in any way &#39;genius&#39;, I am saying that nowadays any person deserving of the big stage for their actual intelligent achievement would get none of the limelight, unless it could be monetized for those who control communication. Geniuses still exist abundantly, our species has successfully commercialized the average person&#39;s attention span. A true genius may not captivate audiences beyond a sensational news clip that can generate ad revenue from the subject&#39;s ability to grab the masses attention momentarily--and only if it aligns to the content provider&#39;s goals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The great&#39;s only come around so often. If you look at the best physicists of all time that changed how we view the time it took centuries of gigantic break through&#39;s spread throughout, and thousands of mini breakthroughs as well that we remember much less. </p>

<p>I firmly believe we&#39;re on the cusp of another great breakthrough of finding the TOE. We have all the tools that the best technologies could give us in our hands right now from the LHC to the James Webb coming up soon. We recently discovered the Higg&#39;s Boson, and Peter Higgs is still alive (Genius) as well as the discovery of Gravitational Waves.  The technologies get a lot of credit for the discoveries but the teams that are working behind them are absolute geniuses that deserve some love too. Which is another point, today a lot of the science is done in teams of people, compared to many years ago when 1 man would fill a chalk board trying to solve some mystery of the universe. </p>

<p>The current generation should be the brightest yet. Millennial jokes aside, the tools and information that they&#39;ve had access to growing up will for sure birth some of the greatest minds in history. We also have a few promising theories that are just getting started, like the Holographic Universe theory that a lot of the string theory physicists have switched to. The teams working on these theories are absolute geniuses as well. </p>

<p>As a change of the times I think there&#39;s more teams working together with technology rather than 1 genius brain doing everything.</p>
