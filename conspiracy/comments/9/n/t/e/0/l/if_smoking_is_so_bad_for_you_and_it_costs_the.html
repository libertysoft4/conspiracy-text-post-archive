<p>Everything in moderation, unless it bioaccumulates, like dimethyl mercury and lead. There are no safe amounts of either substance. Also, according to a study in <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18">the Lancet</a>31310-2/fulltext), alcohol use should be reconsidered.

    <div class="md"><p>Dimethylmercury ((CH3)2Hg) is an organomercury compound. A highly reactive, flammable, and colorless liquid, dimethylmercury is one of the strongest known neurotoxins, with a quantity of less than 0.1 mL capable of inducing severe mercury poisoning, and is easily absorbed through the skin. Dimethylmercury is capable of permeating many materials, including plastic and rubber compounds. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Wetterhahn?wprov=sfla1">Death of Karen Wetterhahn</a> </p>

<p>Yeah, Anslinger had to do something! That department was circling the drain. What a corrupt, racist, hypocritical jackass he was. He employed Col. George Hunter White (the agent in charge of MKULTRA sub project Operation Midnight Climax) to frame and kill Billie Holiday.  </p>

<p>Anslinger also supplied dope to one Joseph McCarthy, , on the low. Some sources say heroin, some say morphine. 
 Heroin is diacetyl morphine -- just another form of ordinary hospital morphine. The only difference is that heroin is three times stronger by weight. One grain of heroin equals three grains of morphine. They are both converted to the same form of morphine when they enter the body, so they are medically interchangeable. Now, if you want to know why the drugs are equivalent but one is legal while the other is banned entirely, you can find the answer to that in <a href="http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/cu/CU9.html">Chapter 9 of the Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs</a>. </p>

<p>If someone is addicted to morphine/heroin and they are not getting it from a legal source, then they are getting heroin, because the only form of the drug regularly available on the black market is heroin. Therefore, it is correct to say that someone who is addicted to one is addicted to the other -- particularly if they are not getting it from a legal source. The word &quot;heroin&quot; may be viewed as more inflammatory -- but only if you don&#39;t understand that the two drugs are really the same.  </p>

<p>People are self medicating or getting high. Coping or partying. Sometimes both. They shouldn&#39;t be made criminals over it, and they shouldn&#39;t be made to believe they have a disease they are helpless against without total abstinence and higher powers. </p>

<p>The word &quot;heroin&quot; may be viewed as more inflammatory -- but only if you don&#39;t understand that the two drugs are really the same. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>the two drugs aren&#39;t the same when administered intravenously, as heroin administration produces other active metabolites besides morphine, the most relevant of which is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3791993/">6-MAM</a></p>

<p>quoting from the link:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Heroin is considered to be one of the most addicting drugs of abuse (Anthony et al., 1994). It does however have a low-binding affinity (Inturrisi et al., 1983; Gianutsos et al., 1986) and efficacy (Selley et al., 2001) at the μ-opioid receptors (MORs), and is believed to act mainly as a prodrug (Inturrisi et al., 1983; Gianutsos et al., 1986). Heroin is highly lipophilic and has a high apparent permeability through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) (Oldendorf et al., 1972). Thus an effective delivery of active metabolites to the brain has been used as an explanation for the highly addictive properties of heroin, where morphine customarily has been considered to be the most relevant active compound mediating heroin euphoria and reward. However, other metabolites, like 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G), also possess pharmacological activity (Way et al., 1960; Inturrisi et al., 1983; Pasternak et al., 1987; Strandberg et al., 2006) and are therefore likely to contribute to the heroin effects. The pharmacological contribution of 6-MAM after acute or chronic administration of heroin has however only to a limited extent been studied.</p>

<p>Andersen et al. (2009) have shown that 6-MAM reached much higher concentrations than heroin or morphine in both blood and brain after s.c. administration of heroin to mice. Moreover, the acute behavioural effects observed after heroin administration were more closely related to brain concentrations of 6-MAM than to heroin and morphine, indicating that 6-MAM was the compound mainly responsible for these effects. Subsequent pharmacokinetic analysis of these data showed that the transfer rate for heroin from blood to brain was much lower than its conversion rate to 6-MAM in blood. These results would imply that heroin was rapidly metabolized to 6-MAM and only a small fraction of the heroin dose was able to reach the brain, while the high 6-MAM concentrations in brain were merely reflecting transfer of 6-MAM formed in blood (Boix et al., 2013). Together, these observations challenge the view that morphine, formed in the brain from rapidly entering heroin, is the compound mainly responsible for the effects of heroin (Oldendorf et al., 1972; National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2005). Accordingly, they also question the generalization of numerous neurobiological studies using morphine, to also account for mechanisms involved in heroin-related effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for updating my information. I didn&#39;t know that. However, like the study you cited says, that&#39;s not conclusive. Not everyone injects their drugs. Heroin is often smoked and snorted. Morphine eaten by tablets. Not every opiate user graduates to heroin, and not everyone who uses graduates to a needle. I was on morphine for six years and knew heroin addicts. The IV users are still in the gutter. I&#39;m clean for about six years and quit cold turkey. </p>

<p>The route of administration seems to matter some. I also wonder if the same problem when interpreting data from mouse to human has the same issue as with amphetamines. Lab mice are given large bolus doses of amphetamines, which isn&#39;t how people use recreational drugs. People build a tolerance after days of increasing the doses. Lab mice don&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Somehow the cigarettes seemed to slow down my digestive system and regulated it.  I see someone talks about them being diuretic, but I had the opposite problem of being in the bathroom 30 times a day with diarrhea.  I tested my theory by stopping cigarettes for 2 weeks, which wasn’t hard for me to do.  But the ulcerative colitis came back with a vengeance.  After suffering with this for 25 years, I decided I’d risk the potential problems associated with cigarettes in exchange for a chance to live a normal life.  I do understand I may experience problems, even life threatening ones, down the road as a result of cigarettes but to have even a decade of normalcy regarding the bathroom issues is well worth it to me.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read similar arguments, but actually made by serious economists/actuaries.  Smokers die earlier than non-smokers, saving pensions years if not decades in pension payments.  People who paid into a pension for 30 years have grown a nest egg that in many cases has no death beneficiary, and goes back into the pension pool.</p>

<p>And there are other add-on costs, people who live longer are just statistically more likely to get age-related chronic illnesses which are expensive to treat.  Lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease are expensive to treat, but they often kill quickly.  &quot;Healthy&quot; people with other chronic illnesses can require decades of expensive treatment.</p>

<p>A lot of pension plans have collapsed in the last 20 years, and much of the blame is laid on under-investment, shady accounting, &quot;borrowing&quot;, etc, but it&#39;d be interesting to know what effects are the byproduct of declining smoking breaking the actuarial models on lifespan which had built-in estimates on premature death which were influenced by smoking.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>If smoking is so bad for you and it costs the government so much in health care, then why is it not banned?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because smokers die younger than they otherwise would, and require less &quot;end of life&quot; care, they save the taxpayers money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>LONDON — Preventing obesity and smoking can save lives, but it does not save money, according to a new report.</p>

<p>It costs more to care for healthy people who live years longer, according to a Dutch study that counters the common perception that preventing obesity would save governments millions of dollars.</p>

<p>&quot;It was a small surprise,&quot; said Pieter van Baal, an economist at the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands, who led the study. &quot;But it also makes sense. If you live longer, then you cost the health system more.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the US we have the Master Tobacco Settlement Agreement.</p>

<p>In 1996 46 states settled all of their Medicare cases that were cigarette caused with the major players in tobacco. In return, the tobacco industry disbanded most of their trade groupes and lobby groups, and created the &quot;truth campaign&quot; to push a non smoking retorect on the people.</p>

<p>The states receive a minimum of 26 million over 25 years, along with a percentage of the profits on every cigarette sold, above and beyond state and federal tax.</p>

<p>Many states, California being the best example, used that incoming windfall to bond and use the money in advance for road work, and other basic needs they didn&#39;t have a budget for.</p>

<p>So the states are literally towed to tobacco sales for their own income and financial good.</p>

<p>The truth campaign is run by big tobacco. Note they are focused on anti vape and anti juul ads nowdays.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a conspiracy it&#39;s out there if you search the master tobacco settlement agreement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s a bad system? I don&#39;t understand what you mean.  European countries are not marginally cheaper overall for healthcare expenses compared with the USA by virtue of the fact that they have the government acting as a single healthcare provider proxy for the taxpayers.  Its because they just have  slightly less corruption.  They still have created a monopolistic system where the citizens are getting ripped off and in many cases are not even allowed to make their own healthcare decisions, just stuck with whatever the government decides is best.  </p>

<p>In the USA the single biggest difference maker is that we have the FDA granting government sanctioned monopolies for products which puts prices through the roof.  That isn&#39;t going to change if we merely expand medicare.</p>

<p>I guarantee you that that claim is utter bullshit. Private healthcare exists in those nations the same as it does in the US - if you have the money you can obtain any medical service that US private healthcare providers supply.</p>

<p>You still have a choice - but you get an <em>extra</em> choice - to obtain some form of treatment for &quot;free&quot;.</p>

<p>Because of the competition from the public healthcare system, private providers are forced to lower their prices and increase the quality of their services to make choosing them a more attractive option.</p>

<p>That&#39;s good for poor people <em>and</em> the people that can afford private healthcare.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not good for the profit margins of private healthcare providers, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real question is: Why are any substances banned?<br/>
The government will answer that it&#39;s because they are harmful.<br/>
But because tobacco and alcohol are not banned even though they are much more harmful than many of the banned substances, we know there must be other factors.<br/>
Here are some of them:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The PTB know that the taxcattle (in every country), seek out substances for unwinding, relieving stress or just feeling better, so they allow certain non-mind-expanding substances (like tobacco, alcohol and caffeine) to keep the plebs from turning to mind-expanding substances (like cannabis &amp; psychedelics). The PTB  didn&#39;t choose tobacco, alcohol &amp; caffeine. Those were already widely popular; they just chose to ban virtually everything else <em>but</em> them.  </p></li>
<li><p>Like the pharmaceutical industry and the meat &amp; dairy industry, the tobacco and alcohol industries have weak (or non-existent) ethics, so they have no qualms about bribing judges &amp; politicians, or flat-out planting people in political positions to write (or rewrite) laws in their favor.  </p></li>
<li><p>Although alcohol and tobacco are damaging to health, the political system is now so perverted and intertwined with the pharmaceutical &amp; medical industry, that sick people can actually be more valuable to the PTB than healthy people; particularly older people who aren&#39;t very productive taxcattle any more, have already had all the kids they&#39;re going to have, are resistant to political/societal change and will soon be collecting money <em>from</em> the government coffers.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s not banned because the tobacco industry in the US is huge. Tobacco is a large reason the US was strong and rich enough to fight for independence; it was a gigantic industry for the US from the beginning. Worldwide, American tobacco is considered the best. In France and Russia they consider American tobacco cigarettes superior. </p>

<p>Because of the age, history, and wealth of the tobacco industry it is intertwined with the American government. The families that own these companies are powerful and vaunted in Washington. </p>

<p>However, their power has been waning. They are trying to diversify their investments as fewer people pick up smoking today. See the Juul. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prohibition doesn&#39;t work. To answer your question about taxes, it doesn&#39;t matter how much health care spending is related to cigarettes for those in charge. The spending today is a result of past smoking and can&#39;t be avoided with any changes they could make. The spending tomorrow doesn&#39;t matter to them because they won&#39;t be in power then. Cutting off revenues from tobacco taxes would negatively impact them today (less spending money) with no benefit to themselves in the future, when they&#39;re out of power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the only hard data I know is from holland where there was some research into the exact cost/benefit of this all. The [source](<a href="http://www.stoprokenvandaag.nl/tabak-roken-en-tabaksindustrie/wat-kost-roken-de-nederlands-maatsschappij/">http://www.stoprokenvandaag.nl/tabak-roken-en-tabaksindustrie/wat-kost-roken-de-nederlands-maatsschappij/</a>) is in Dutch but it&#39;s from a anti smoking website.</p>

<p>Basic numbers add up to total to a 2.4 billion loss of revenue due to lost productivity. Taxes are higher here but they produce about 2.3 billion. Then there are lower costs in health care because smokers live shorter and when they get ill it&#39;s generally terminal saving about 600 million and about 1,2 billion saved in government pensions. The industry itself adds about 230 million to the economy. Adding misc costs etc, smokers generate a net profit of about 1,5 billion for the state.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>And smoking isn&#39;t banned because people are allowed to make bad choices.  If we were just working bees the government  would dictate our lives, put us in jobs to our competency to maximize productivity for the collective. </p>

<p>If carbon pollution is causing catastrophic global warming, outlaw global oil-powered shipping. Just use sails to move things around. All those bright lights used for adverts like in time square and vegas, get rid of &#39;em.</p>

<p>Flu kills thousands each year and costs millions in healthcare and worktime lost. So make the flu shot mandatory.</p>

<p>Illegal prostitution results in the trafficking of women and spread of STD&#39;s and other disease. It could be curtailed or eliminated with proper oversight and legalization.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s not actually a huge cost or drain at all in comparison to the taxes to be had from the sale of it and driving the price up with those taxes in the guise of discouraging addicts who&#39;ll still manage to scrimp and scrape up whatever it costs precisely because they&#39;re addicted to it. Drug dealers are drug dealers, addicted to the money to be made off it and the government is no different in that regard no matter what else it says.</p>

<p>While non-smokers like to bitch and complain or suggest that smokers deserve no mercy, if they had to pony up the billions or suffer the cuts if the government ever lost those revenues, they&#39;d all be singing a very different tune.  </p>

<p>Employers will no longer have to offer healthcare. Almost nobody (percentage wise) will be able to afford private or supplemental insurance. If you thought you saw a bit of outrage over Obamacare just wait til people realize the bill of goods being sold to them now.</p>
