<p>Also and this is unrelated, but imagine you see something you weren’t supposed to, then bam, the government hits you with a chemical that forces deja vu onto you, only you remember it differently than it actually happened because of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I know what has been studied and observed, but if I may try and clarify what I mean by that, while they have observed that the part of the brain which is active during deja-vu is the long term memory part, it still hasn&#39;t been determined yet whether consciousness itself is a direct product of neuron activity in the brain (in which case the theory would quite likely be true) or if it&#39;s non-local to the brain and that it simply tunes into consciousness like a radio tunes into a tap frequency (in which case what they&#39;d have observed in the brain would not be the primary cause of the deja-vu, but rather a reactionary process). I hope that makes sense.  </p>

<p>Ah, you mean something like the memory flash pen in Men in Black? Yeah I wouldn&#39;t be that surprised if i learned that some deep military project has made that. They had microwave induced voice-to-skull tech in the 70s, so who knows what they&#39;ve got today! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ar you guys drunk when you make these posts?</p>

<p>Deja Vu is the moment when your brain realizes it has a connection for the present moment in the past of its stored forgotten memories\; there are lots of things that the brain pays no attention to - BUT when something unimportant catches its attention - it does a shallow quick in the past and refreshes those memories it deemed unimportant.</p>

<p>tl;dr Its remembering a similar moment of the past, which is bound to happen because we live the same repetitive lives over and over again</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see it more as a &quot;mile stone&quot; of some sorts. My soul chose to be here at this particular time IMO. That memory or premonition means something to it&#39;s (my) journey. A reminder if you will. </p>

<p>What about that experience is important? What are you trying to learn or remember about? Deja Vu is very similar to gut feelings IMO. Intuition or the soul speaking directly to our physical manifestations for one reason or another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Deja vu is practically impossible to study due to how rarely it occurs. IIR, the scientific consensus is that your retinas kinda glitch-out, slightly delaying the conveyance of vital visual information to the brain by mili or even nano-seconds, leaving your brain with the impression that it has already processed the information, which it has in an incomplete way. This is what always made the most sense to me anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve speculated about deja-vu, and one potential explanation I came up with was that it&#39;s because you&#39;ve lived it before. This is based on the presumption that reincarnation is the general mechanism regarding the continuity of consciousness, but that incarnation isn&#39;t necessarily limited to occurring at birth. Sure, that&#39;s the usual time it occurs, but I think it&#39;s possible one can reincarnate back into the same life at different points much like loading a save file in an RPG.<br/>
Alternatively, it&#39;s a phenomena relating to one&#39;s morphogenetic field - the electromagnetic field that surrounds the body and permeates into the surrounding space by a few feet (and since space and time are two aspects of the same medium, spacetime, then also permeates into the immediately surrounding time by a few seconds). Look up Rupert Sheldrake for more info into morphogenetic fields and morphogenetic resonance. Could even be a bit of both.<br/>
I&#39;ve done a lot of research into various theories of consciousness and could dive real deep into this and elaborate on how I came to these conclusions if you&#39;d like, but I just wanted to stop there for now at the outline of those two hypotheses before I lose track of myself haha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whatever it is there&#39;s no doubting the total trip it is. Can only really say I&#39;ve felt what it&#39;s described as a few times. Twice it&#39;s been a rather light feeling and a bit of acknowledgment to oneself that I&#39;ve sorta been here before and seen these surroundings, despite not of course. </p>

<p>The other instance was the most mind bending and distinctly different in that the whole episode, with it&#39;s happenings, environment and the whole scenario was close to absolute perfect detail of just how I knew it was to play out when i entered into it. Near floored me in it&#39;s accuracy and to this day it&#39;s still one of those things that I shake my head at and think wtf was that all about.</p>

<p>u/slumpedmf explanation makes as most theoretical sense to me that I&#39;ve ever come across when compared to the other &#39;multiverse&#39;, spirit, soul type of explanations that I&#39;m aware of. Having been through 3 or 4 sleep paralysis events and the holy fuck moment that it is the 1st couple of times, the explanation makes even more sense when keeping in mind what the body and mind are doing in paralysis as described by experts at least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once a friend had a Deja vu feeling, but as he explained he saw what will happen. It happened 5 years ago, we where smoking some weed, we called to order pizza but the delivery was late. We called to cancel the order because me and him where leaving ( we where at another friend&#39;s place ). When standing up to leave he had the deja vu, He said that by the time we get home I will be called back by the pizza delivery guy to tell us that the pizza is ready for delivery and if we still want it. and it happened exactly how he said it. I still believe it could be anything and maybe it depends from person to person and situation to situation, for some it&#39;s remembering the future, for some it&#39;s remembering that you chose to be here right now, and maybe for some it&#39;s just random feeling that on another plane they chose this moment to just have fun with a thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish I still experienced deja vu as often as I use to. Been years since I had an episode. I use to naturally lucid dream very often. Sometimes several times a week. Also use to have OBEs a lot. I really enjoyed those experiences and liked to experiment with the OBE&#39;s especially. For some reason, as I get older, I barely have any of those things anymore. </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>As far as deja vu is concerned... Perhaps it has to do with the theory that time is an illusion. </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;
Einstein said-People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.</p>

<p>If past, present and future happen simultaneously, deja vu could be use noticing it for a short time. </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Or it could be related to one of the quantum physics. Retrocausality is the idea that the future can effect the past.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Or maybe the &quot;observer theory&quot;. Where the observer affects (or creates) reality.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>These things are so interesting. If I could change the past, I&#39;d study quantum physics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what happens to me is i swear to god i dreamt that moment before it happened. i will try to summarize  my understanding which i concluded from reading and discussing these matters, i hope it answers some of ur questions regarding deja vu and other stuff like life after death or ghosts and spirits, its very complicated and i&#39;ll try to make it as simple as possible as am not an English speaker and the words am trying to translate are super super hard. the humen body contains two soft unmeasured bodies which are self, as in myself and the soul or the spirit, the self cannot travel outside the meter of the physical body as if it did you will die, on the other hand your soul can travel unimaginable distances and con conquer other dimensions with training and teaching ( it can take a life time or at least a couple years for a simple ride)  the souls belong to a world called world of order(literal translation) and in that world there is no time neither physical laws , no past, no future, no tomorrow and no today  and when you die the smaller death which is sleeping basically your soul travel to that world and leave your body but yourself stays as if it leaves you die. there are situations where the soul stays in that world and doesn&#39;t come back  for different reasons such as being in a coma. with hard training you can connect your physical body and your soul together to know all of this but as i say it can take a lifetime. what you sees in dejavus and other paranormal stuff that happens to humans my guessing is glimpses or flashbacks from this process, this is a very very deep discussion and its like swimming in the ocean and i dont recommend anyone try to dig deep as you for sure need a mentor that reached perfection and knowledge not 90% of the process, but 120% as any mistake the damage is hugely big and the percentage of u meeting that person in life is 000.001%. i hope this comment reaches as much audience as it can but i doubt it as i was just in the mood of writing in english which is is once in three monthes :D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i have always thought that deja vu is an intersection of reality colliding with a stored “memory” that is a result of our subconscious self defense exploring every possible scenario from every single moment.  but it’s like cache so it is temporary storage as a way for our brain to access all the potential threats around us and subconsciously guide us. and so, something like intuition is our preconceived scenario that is similar but not identical, combined with the subconscious cues we are picking up from our surroundings. and deja vu is the rare occasion where those projected futures, stored like cache, exactly line up with the situation that is unfolding before us. </p>
