        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Good evening,</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to start by saying that I am not an anti-vaxxer and am in fact vaccinated myself.  I am currently of the believe that vaccines are of little threat to human body and are, as a whole, necessary for a safe and stable society.  All of this to say, recently I have seen a &quot;narrative&quot; shift when pro and con people argue from &quot;vaccines do not cause autism you idiot!!!!&quot; to &quot;even if they do cause autism, it is better for your child to be alive with autism than killed by a deadly disease.&quot;  </p>

<p>This is concerning to me as this shift leads me to believe that there is some possibility of vaccines having negative health consequences especially for children.</p>

<p>My question to you r/conspiracy is this.  Do you personally believe that there is a possible health risk to vaccines?  </p>

<p>for instance.  let&#39;s say vax actually worked ok.  then you vax for disease A.  that&#39;s cool.  when you vax for A and B and C you start to multiply complications.  the edge condtions increase based on the number of pre existing edges.  so if you have a really complex machine..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Wakefield asks the question..Why ?, the reason was that the MMR vaccine that GSK had developed contained a strain of the Mumps virus Urabi Am9, a dangerous viral strain that caused meningitis which was discovered in Canada and Japan ( which subsequently banned the MMR vaccine) when the MMR was introduced there, and was quickly withdrawn but still used in the UK. However, Merck at the time had a safer MMR version not containing Urabi Am9, and the French also had a safer version but the UK government wanted to buy British as contended by Dr Wakefield.  Dr Wakefield also states that the UK government took the safety standards of the Merck MMR and applied it to the GSK MMR so as the vaccine looked safer.  This in theory is possible with the same drug but with a vaccine it is a different ball game in terms of development.  Within 4 years of its introduction it had to be withdrawn because of it causing meningitis.  Furthermore instead of this withdrawn MMR vaccine made by GSK being destroyed, it was stored for later use and then sold on to Brazil that ended up with a meningitis outbreak as a result…don’t you just love to live in our modern world..the sleazy, corrupt underbelly of a world we all call home…hot damn..I love to be in the land of the living.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The leading cause of anti vaxxers is watching vaccines take out someone you love. You say you are vaccinated; the number of vaccines required in the US, and a lot of countries, has increased dramatically. So, you may not have experienced the number of neurotoxic insults most newborns are taking now. </p>

<p>There is a good chance many of the assumptions made by vaccine science are not even true, they have not been studied. NIH and Cochrane researchers have both called out the CDC on institutional bias in interpreting findings and using questionable basis for recommendations regarding the flu vaccine in particular. If you follow the vaccine adverse event reporting site, flu vaccine is the most dangerous vaccine for causing death and other problems. </p>

<p>Recently there has been attention on the fact that flu vaccine in pregnant women has never been studied, but casually encouraged. Although CDC’s own studies have shown increased levels of miscarriages (3-7x), no warnings have been made to healthcare or the public. </p>

<p>There are so many egregious lack of science instances.  Many ingredients used in vaccines, known dangerous toxins, have never been studied for safety in vaccines. Like Aluminum, which is now suspected of brain damage. Doses in children are not weight adjusted, which is a major change in how drugs are given to children, and yet given on day one of life. US has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the industrialized world. </p>

<p>Keep reading independent research. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The premise is simple. Big pharma can&#39;t make regular prescription drugs without a host of side effects and possible consequences, but we&#39;re expected to believe a proven regulatory captured agency in the CDC ( <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-merck-gerberding/former-cdc-head-lands-vaccine-job-at-merck-idUSTRE5BK2K520091221">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-merck-gerberding/former-cdc-head-lands-vaccine-job-at-merck-idUSTRE5BK2K520091221</a> ) when they say the current vaccine schedule is ok. </p>

<p>There are issues with not just the actual studies being funded by pharmaceutical companies, but with the underlying premises themselves being tested under faulty premises. Namely that vaccine studies are not controlled for long term effects, effects are studies on adults but not on children (and the results are in no way adjusted for the differences in weight, let alone development, and the studies are tested one vaccine at a time despite the fact that most vaccinations are given in a battery and we&#39;re to assume there&#39;s no synergistic effect that occurs even though this is a fundamental property of the universe when observing complex systems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any shift in the pro-vaccine narrative is simply a change in tactics to appeal to different audiences. Some anti-vaxxers think they cause autism, some think they&#39;re dangerous, some think they&#39;re intentionally dangerous. And because of this, the argument against them has to change to appeal to their beliefs. A discussion on morality with a Christian, for example, would be wildly different than with an atheist.</p>

<p>There are micrograms of additives in vaccines with specific purposes, but they&#39;re safe. There are dozens of dubious studies claiming the harm or safety of vaccines, most of which are funded by corporations with political leanings (on both sides). There are legitimate studies to be found but people around here are always going to try and coax you into thinking they know better, often citing absurd sources.</p>

<p>The reason there&#39;s even a pro-vaxx &#39;narrative&#39; is because they want people to stop dying of preventable illnesses. The real science hasn&#39;t convinced anti-vaxx groups, so there&#39;s always an appeal to emotions as part of the platform. There are children and elderly people dying because people think they know better and that they&#39;re somehow smarter than the system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is where most vax debate gets caught up. everyone wants vaccines, no one wants polio. vaccines are great, its the unnecessary adjuvants that getcha. is this where you tell me micrograms of aluminum salts are perfectly safe?</p>

<p>&quot;Vaccines</p>

<p>Alum, which is composed of aluminum salts, was the first vaccine adjuvant to be widely used in the United States. It has been used for more than 70 years. Alum is included in many U.S. vaccines, including those that prevent hepatitis B, human papillomavirus (HPV), and pneumococcus infections.</p>

<p>Alum was the only vaccine adjuvant in use in the United States until 2009, when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Cervarix, an HPV vaccine that contains an adjuvant called AS04. This adjuvant is a combination of alum and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), an immune-stimulating lipid (fat). In 2013, FDA approved the inclusion of another combination adjuvant, AS03, in the pandemic H5N1 influenza vaccine. Currently, this vaccine is included in the U.S. vaccine stockpile but is not commercially available. AS03 is an oil-in-water emulsion that is similar to MF59, an adjuvant that has been used for many years in licensed flu vaccines in more than 30 countries outside the United States. Scientists continue to develop novel antigen-adjuvant combinations.​&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Just watch the before and after videos of the kids on YouTube who were fine and normal before vaccines and then withdrawn autistic half wits after. The parents are.saying they were FINE and then got shots and STOPPED SMILING and STOPPED developing. The timing is too coincidental. Look at the rates of SIDS and Autism and the vaccination charts. They tell you not to give your baby tylenol...but thimerosal and who knows what is fine? Would you even think it would be a good.idea to inject SALINE INTO A NEWBORN? Think about it.
 A healthy newborn. Does it need the stress of a syringe of plain saline?
 Imagine that question. Now imagine an immune system jacking combo of mercury stabbed into the child....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is where most vax debate gets caught up. everyone wants vaccines, no one wants polio. vaccines are great, its the unnecessary adjuvants that getcha. is this where you tell me micrograms of aluminum salts are perfectly safe?</p>

<p>&quot;Vaccines</p>

<p>Alum, which is composed of aluminum salts, was the first vaccine adjuvant to be widely used in the United States. It has been used for more than 70 years. Alum is included in many U.S. vaccines, including those that prevent hepatitis B, human papillomavirus (HPV), and pneumococcus infections.</p>

<p>Alum was the only vaccine adjuvant in use in the United States until 2009, when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Cervarix, an HPV vaccine that contains an adjuvant called AS04. This adjuvant is a combination of alum and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), an immune-stimulating lipid (fat). In 2013, FDA approved the inclusion of another combination adjuvant, AS03, in the pandemic H5N1 influenza vaccine. Currently, this vaccine is included in the U.S. vaccine stockpile but is not commercially available. AS03 is an oil-in-water emulsion that is similar to MF59, an adjuvant that has been used for many years in licensed flu vaccines in more than 30 countries outside the United States. Scientists continue to develop novel antigen-adjuvant combinations.​&quot;</p>
