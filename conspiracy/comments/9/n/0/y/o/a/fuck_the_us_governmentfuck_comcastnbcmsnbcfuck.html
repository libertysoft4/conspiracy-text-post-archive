        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you wonder Why is amazon censoring/harrassing the release of David Ray Griffin&#39;s new book <strong>9/11 Unmasked</strong>--its because the people who were behind 9/11 know that We the People do not believe their fairy tales about the JFK/MLK/RFK Assassinations and 9/11.  </p>

<p>The US government didn&#39;t want a REAL 9/11 investigation--so they loaded the 9/11 Commission with scum fucks who would pump out their Official Lies.  Con Man Philip Zelikow made sure the Commission was controlled from start to finish.  The Corrupt US MSM willingly did not do their job by investigating thoroughly and, in fact, propped up the Official Lies.  </p>

<p>They know that we know their Official Lies are BULLSHIT--and once enough of us know then it will spread.  Eventually leaders of other countries will know--and when that happens the USA and Israel will have to face the blow back from running their False Flag Psy Op on September, 11, 2001...</p>

<p>Those who planned and carried out 9/11 are still largely in control.  Kevin Ryan&#39;s #1 Suspect Dick Cheney was one of Trump&#39;s earliest supporters (he said he would vote for Trump if he won the Republication nomination, then backed Trump once he did win).  Trump also has John Bolton (one of Dick Cheney&#39;s sloths) as his National Security Advisor.  Bolton was also Zionist of the Year in 2017--and went to Israel to collect his &quot;Guardian of Zion&quot; award.</p>

<p>WE THE PEOPLE are fucking WINNING--which is Why amazon is going to such lengths to harass the release of David Ray Griffin&#39;s new book.  FUCK amazon and Fuck Bezos--I will order directly from the publisher and will not be ordering from you shit fucks at amazon anymore.  Over the past 10 years or so I have ordered literally hundreds of items thru amazon--NEVER AGAIN.  </p>

<p>Fuck the admins of Reddit for &quot;quaranteening&quot; 9/11 Truth sub, too.   The admins are lackeys of the US government and Reddit has been ruined by the waves of Psy Ops programs which we have seen put in place--mostly before/during/after the 2016 election.  </p>

<p>The most important thing to know is that WE ARE WINNING...The 9/11 Official Story does not hold up--and We the People will continue to press for Truth.  The murderous psychopaths who planned and carried out 9/11 ARE FUCKING SCARED even 17 years later.  Those who helped Cover Up the criminals will also face prosecution (looking at you, Zelikow).</p>

<p>It is not the Russians who are fucking We the People--it is our own government that we allow to LIE to us year after year.  The Swindles of the CIA and DOD in the post-9/11 era will come to an end.  The illegal wars the US military is involved with must end, too--and the REAL TERRORISTS (some of them embedded in our own government) must be investigated and brought to justice.  I truly hope to see the long list of US war criminals put on trial (or at least scared they may be prosecuted).  </p>

<p>This is NOT about Democrats and Republicans--they are both Corrupt Parties (corporate whores and warmongers)--and the Corrupt US MSM keeps pushing the 2 Party System upon We the People.  </p>

<p>Fuck the Democrats!!!</p>

<p>...and Fuck the Republicans!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple of reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are a number of &quot;closed primary states&quot; which means in order to vote in primaries you have to choose a political party.</li>
<li>People are inherently tribal and like to be a part of something they can identify with. It is easier to effect change in the direction you want with the support of others. Many partisans choose their political party based on the dislike of the opposing one.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s sad to say, but America is run by extremists: war-mongering CIA extremists who are really, really good liars, and the &quot;mainstream&quot; media spreads the CIA&#39;s lies every night (and the &quot;Defense&quot; industry&#39;s lies).  Rip-off kings they are.  </p>

<p>&quot;War is a racket.&quot;  And the CIA and &quot;Defense&quot; industry are racketeers, robbing us of <strong><em>tens of Trillions</em></strong> in taxes.</p>

<p>President Eisenhower warned us of the Military-Industrial Complex in his last speech as President.  Since the 1950s, the CIA and &quot;Defense&quot; industry have robbed Americans of <strong><em>at least 40 TRILLION</em></strong> in taxes.  We should have heeded President Eisenhower&#39;s warning.</p>

<p>President Kennedy tried to do something about it, and look what happened to him.</p>

<p>its the pieces of dog shit ZIONIST that are what we consider Israel, and Israeli politics, that are responsible for the crimes against humanity, the push for WWIII, the blackmail and control of the US gov via filmed pedophilia events, and as many know, this can all be traced back to the Rothschild&#39;s who created Israel, and have a fondness for incest and pedophilia that traces back generations.</p>

<p>They want us to attack each other, and other innocents. </p>

<p>Lets not forget who is really to blame, and who really deserves to die by the sword!</p>

<p>They dont live in Israel, They live in the UK, and Switzerland among other places.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>never heard of it, and honestly i fucking hate reddit, im only here to raise some hell, and wake some people up.
ive been banned, shadow banned from multiple things of these topics, and i get really aggressive with journalist who publish intentional misleading stuff. so i dont expect any account to last long, but ill definitely check it out.
one things that does bother me it the &quot;A&quot; is intentionally pyramid shaped, kinda their call sign, same with Voat, put the 2 together from their name and you get a pentagram!
im kinda a harker, not for crime, not for profit, for security, the more and more i learn the less and less i think any of this crap will lead somewhere good</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The internet has been completely neutered. I tried to watch a youtube video tonight that I&#39;ve seen for 10 years, it&#39;s been removed. Entire searches are completely off limits and replaced. For anybody who&#39;s been on Reddit for more than 2 years, you know it&#39;s a shell of its former self. Everybody who is SLIGHTLY controversial is being completely blacked out. Alex Jones (someone most conspiracy theorists don&#39;t even think is that far out there) is being removed FFS. This is insanity. We are a frog in a pot of boiling water right and right now we are seconds away from being cooked. Google, Facebook, Apple, Youtube, Reddit, Amazon, etc. are carefully screening EVERYTHING you have access to. You&#39;re not allowed to think outside of their carefully curated paradigm. This is the worst the internet has been since it&#39;s inception. We are China now.</p>

And the United States is propaganda, what we learned is bull shit. Our country isn&#39;t the land of the free it&#39;s the land of extremist terrosim. We shall not let this get into our heads we shall prevail and get rid of those evil acts! OPEN YOUR EYES YOU ARE A TEST SUBJECT FOR THE NEW WORLD ORDER! CASES OF JFK ASSASSINATION AND THE COVER UP BY THE ASSASSIN THAT ASSASSINATED JFK IS BY THE CLUB MANAGER THAT WAS WORKING WITH THE CIA. THERE IS A REASON PEOPLE! JFK WAS NEVER WORKING WITH THE ILLUMINATI, HE WAS TRYING TO GO AGAINST THEM! HE TRICKED THE ILLUMINATI TO LET HIM BE PRESIDENT BUT IT BACK FIRED. GOOD LORD, OH JESUS WHAT WOULD WE DO? THE ILLUMINATI IS TAKING OVER THE WORLD IN THE DARKNESS. WHAT IF THE SCPF FOUNDATION IS REAL? AND THEY ARE GETTING TECHNOLOGY TO ERASE OUR MEMORY&#39;S AS WE KNOW IT.  WHAT WILL WE DO THEN? WE WANT FREEDOM, THE US IS NOT FREEDOM IS THE CONTROL OF THE MIND WHAT WHICH MAKES US THINK WE ARE FREE! EVERY GOVERNMENT IN THE WORLD HAS A ILLUMINATI  MEMBER. PUZZLES OF HISTORY, NON- INFORMATION IS COMING TOGETHER!
 Also the mountain that starts with the P I believe they are transferring the test subjects who had been made into super humans to the facility. At Area 51. No doubt about it.</p>
