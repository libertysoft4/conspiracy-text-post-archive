        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It all fits together perfectly.  Trump has scheduled a Veteran&#39;s Day Military Parade in DC.  He&#39;s also recently invited Putin to visit the White House in the fall.  </p>

<p>Think about it.  We know the Bastille Day Parade in France made a huge impression on Trump.  He loved the pageantry.  He returned from France and immediately  began planning his own parade under the guise of celebrating US Veterans.  Next, is there anyone Trump wants to impress more than his personal idol Vladimir Putin?</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>Putin will be standing next to Trump in the grandstands watching our military parade down Pennsylvania Avenue this Veteran&#39;s Day as Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines all salute Trump.  Why hasn&#39;t anyone in the media connected these dots yet? </p>

<p>We have a textbook example of untreated Narcissistic Personality Disorder run amuck as President.  His fantasy is to have our military honor him in front if someone he clearly admires.</p>

<p>Our grandchildren will speak Russian if he continues unchallenged.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s a loophole in your theory. Trump is so narcissistic, he doesn’t need to impress ANYBODY. I doubt he’d invite Putin. Would be a stupid move, and would just bring more scrutiny against him about the whole Russia thing.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Except for Putin, for some reason. I mean, I agree with you generally but Trump has always had a weird thing about Putin. Even before he was president and involved politically with him, there was that <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/347191326112112640">weird Trump tweet</a> about hopefully being best friends with Putin while his Miss Universe Pageant was in Russia. Whether it&#39;s because Putin has something on him or merely because he legitimately has some kind of man-crush on him, Trump clearly feels very strongly like he needs to impress him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your loophole has a loophole.  The following description of NPD is from Psychology Today:</p>

<p>People with narcissistic personality disorder believe they are superior or special, and often try to associate with other people they believe are unique or gifted in some way. This association enhances their self-esteem, which is typically quite fragile underneath the surface. Individuals with NPD seek excessive admiration and attention in order to know that others think highly of them. Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder have difficulty tolerating criticism or defeat, and may be left feeling humiliated or empty when they experience an &quot;injury&quot; in the form of criticism or rejection</p>

<p>Sound like someone we know?</p>
