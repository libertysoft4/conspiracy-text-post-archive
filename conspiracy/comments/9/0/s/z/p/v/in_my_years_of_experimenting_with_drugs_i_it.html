There are people out there who will pretend to be your best fucking friend, but they might just have other thoughts in mind which you&#39;re completely unaware of.

    <div class="md"><p>Agree, got to be careful with whom you do psychedelic&#39;s with. A couple of weeks ago I came across LSD. It had been 20 years since I last part took, a young man so I was, a different person all those years ago.</p>

<p>I decided to take on my own, I micro dosed a few times before I took a nice big hit to get the full experience. </p>

<p>Mircodosing was interesting, lifted the first veil of the bs of this world and interacted with people and man, you can see right fucking through them. </p>

<p>Last weekend, took my first big trip in the 20 years, I had a good weekend, I had just dropped my kids back to their mother after their time with me, I was in a very good mood, this is important, and I dropped 2 nice big hits. </p>

<p>Holy fucking shit, 2-3 hours later I did not know who the fuck I was, I was alone, did this on purpose and went with it.</p>

<p>I have done most drugs and very experienced. Every man should know his limits kids, very important. </p>

<p>Anyhow, I could talk all night about my experience as a grown ass man with his shit mostly together. It was fucking amazing. That that 12 hour trip was the most inspiring understanding experience of my life, it reset my brain, of all the past bullshit, shit I had not sorted out or fixed in my head, I thought I had let it all go, the pain, the hurt all that bs, I realized it did not matter and truly let it all go. I power washed my brain of almost 40 years of accumulated shit that would not let go. An elephants weight was off my shoulders. </p>

<p>The most enlightening experience of my life. I bought a good few of these bad boys however, I have no inclining to do again anytime soon, that&#39;s the beauty of things like LSD. I have a very addictive personality and always want more of shit that makes you feel good, LSD, no, it just spoke fucking sense to me in a state of being free. It has helped me deal with depression, it truly has. The trip last week did not cure it, but it helped me talk to it, helped me understand it, why and all that, letting go has eased all that negative bullshit we waste that we so much fucking time living in our own heads and not to be scared to live up to your potential but the potential we have is limitless, I now understand that.</p>

<p>With government regulation of &quot;medical&quot; marijuana they can approve/disapprove strands. My biggest concern is the micro dosing and therapy treatments that are coming up. I think dosing is very effective when properly managed, but throw government and their money into the mix and you have a straight up Equilibrium(2002) future. </p>

<p>Edit: Dosing for treatments of PTSD, depression, anxiety, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is only tangentially related, but what I’d like to have some proof on is whether “trauma based mind control”, i.e. the idea that you put someone through a butt load of horrific trauma that they develop multiple personality disorder (or disassociative identity disorder) [claim 1] and that you can then “program” the “alters” [claim 2]. I understand that this is a very popular (probably not the right word) idea especially in our big ol’community, but do we know for sure that it’s a thing? Do the MKULTRA papers that we got to see attest to this? I mean, I don’t need convincing that the CIA certainly tried traumatising a bunch of men women and children for all kinds of aims, but does it WORK? I realise I’m being rather lazy asking this question, but promise to read any links thrown my way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. I have literally no doubt they were trying - and that they tried/are still trying a shameful amount of different methods, but I&#39;m specifically curious about whether trauma can or (as most of us would have it) always does cause multiple personalities, and secondly whether those can be controlled. </p>

<p>Like, to me, unless both claims work near all of the time, a person with multiple personalities would be a nightmare to program into a mind controlled slave...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought a lot about this lately. Specially with enginered drugs that emulate LSD. Some years ago, 25i nbome was introduced by &quot;surprise&quot; in my country. We thought we were taking LSD and instead we where taking a very aggressive psychedelic that damaged close friends deeply. For a long time it was impossible to get any other kind of psychedelic around here. </p>
