        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In my head, whenever I think of how a building would collapse after being struck by a large object (granted I think it would have to hit kinda low), I would think <a href="https://youtu.be/T1oceE_67MM?t=13">it would fall over</a>. I know an earthquake  didn&#39;t cause the towers to fall, but what kept them from falling down similarly to the video?  <a href="https://youtu.be/8U4erFzhC-U?t=17">This looks like the towers coming down</a>. Am I wrong for thinking that if a building was hit by a plane (that it was designed to withstand) would fall in a way that made sure it didn&#39;t take out other buildings too?</p>

<p>Also, the main reason I know it was an inside job is because of Larry Silverstein. If I took out a huge insurance policy on my wife, and she mysteriously disappeared shortly after, the police wouldn&#39;t even think twice about another suspect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Logically I would agree. You would assume that that damaged area would fall off or collapse but since none of the lower structural integrity was compromised it should stay standing. But people way smarter than me say otherwise.</p>

<p>What&#39;s really interesting is building 6. Everyone wants to talk about 7 but 6 is THE smoking gun.   Prior to 1 or 2 failing, 6 is pulverized and turns to dust. There&#39;s a massive void from where tons of material should be but it&#39;s just gone. It looks like a bunker buster hit it and only left part of the exterior framing in tact. This happens before 1 or 2 fall, so it can&#39;t be blamed on falling material.</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WZBhWRzt-aA">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WZBhWRzt-aA</a></p>

<p>Look at around 25 seconds, building 6 is pulverized before 1,2 or 7 collapse. No real explanation is offered but I believe a DEW was used on several buildings that day.</p>

<p>Listen to the caller talking about how a woman was &quot;encrusted&quot; to the lobby floor and another man is &quot;melted&quot; to the ground. Crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah sure thing. I felt the same way when I first saw this the other day. I spent countless weeks researching this thing and somehow I missed this as well. I actually thought about making a new post just for this because I&#39;ve never seen it discussed here before.</p>

<p>After digging a little more I&#39;m pretty convinced that a Direct Energy Weapon was used that took advantage of the Hutchinson and Casimir effect called molecular dissociation, which is essentially old Tesla tech from 100 years ago. Think of his &quot;earthquake machine&quot; and the Philadelphia experiment, where matter literally disappears into possibly alternate dimensions.  (Yes, bold claim but the evidence and eyewitness testimony of firefighters and parts of this building vanishing in front of other firefighters eyes. Absolutely insane stuff) </p>

<p>Anyway IBM bought the patents for the tech in the late 90&#39;s I believe. But it&#39;s basically an energy device (microwaves, soundwaves, etc. With Tesla coils) it&#39;s focused like a laser and once the resonant frequency is found you get bizarre effects (I&#39;ll link you what I watched) it&#39;s invisible and extremely destructive with anti gravity, time travel and a bunch of other strange results. Remember all the cars, fire engines flipped over and completely destroyed and on fire, while paper, trees and other typically flammable items right on top or next to obliterated twisted metal remaining unharmed? This device produced these bizarre results. Fascinating stuff. No wonder we missed it.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the first video I watched on the topic, definitely worth 2 hours as I truly believe this or something very similar to this was used.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/mb4KejGgPVc">https://youtu.be/mb4KejGgPVc</a></p>

<p>See you down in that rabbit hole..</p>

<p>Edit: this Hutchinson /Casimir effect leads into cold fusion and  zero point energy as well.  Really wild stuff here. Plus I cleared some things up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like lurkpro said holy shit, never seen that video before! Wow... Just wow. Might be the actual smoking gun as mentioned.  Just to go along with it, <a href="https://m.imgur.com/R2dh8tH">here&#39;s a picture</a> of that I believe show it&#39;s innards - this is what got me interested in 6.

    <div class="md"><p>Great pic. Yeah exactly, down to the basement. It&#39;s just gone. Like it was scooped up.  It&#39;s clear in one vid I linked that it gets pulverized before either of the towers 1+2 come down. Apparently nist addressed it but offered no explanation and simply disregarded it. I can&#39;t see how even the people with the MSM hooks deep in them can ignore this.  I may start a new topic with the info to get more people to see it . I think it&#39;s more important than the ridiculous answers to building 7. This building plus the other info I posted about the Hutchinson and Casimir effect is &quot;THE&quot; real story IMO. It solves all the bizarre shit that couldn&#39;t be explained, like the twisted beams, pulverized building, the flipped and burning vehicles, molten steel, all of it is answered by the info in that video. Glad you liked it. 👍</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mossad and its American associates are the obvious culprits behind 9/11. Who benefits from the crime? The attacks against the twin towers started at 8:45 a.m. and four flights are diverted from their assigned air space and no air traffic controller sounds the alarm. And no Air Force jets scramble until 10 a.m. That also smacks of a small scale Air Force rebellion, a coup against the Pentagon perhaps? Radars are jammed, transponders fail. No IFF -- friend or foe identification -- challenge. Even in Pakistan, if there is no response to IFF, jets are instantly scrambled and the aircraft is shot down with no further questions asked. This was clearly an inside job. Bush was afraid and rushed to the shelter of a nuclear bunker. He clearly feared a nuclear situation. Who could that have been? Will that also be hushed up in the investigation, like the Warren report after the Kennedy assassination?</p>

<p>The whole world already knows this. This is a simple restatement of what everybody already knows.</p>

<p>Everywhere except in America, where Jewish dominated media envelops everyone in a poisoned darkness, everybody knows that Jewish kingpins pulled off 9/11 as an excuse for making war on every obstacle to their world financial hegemony, and killing as many non-Jews as possible in the process to further consolidate their domination of the whole world.</p>

<p>This widening war on the Islamic world, already responsible for millions of unnecessary deaths, is a direct result of the 9/11 hoax, everything based on false spin concocted by Jewish strategists not for U.S. best interests, but for the demonic master plan of the Jewish Sanhedrin, which rules the Jewish moneymen who buy the presidents and the generals, to kill or enslave the rest of the world. They control you, whether you want to admit or not. They control your bank account. And they make you support their insane war program by all this wall-to-wall patriotic spin.</p>

<p>The totally Jewish-controlled U.S. media have long ago suspended their journalistic capabilities in favor of blatant cheerleading about their favorite subject - Muslim terrorists. Every day they urge you to kill them. If there ever was a systemic hate crime, this is it.</p>

<p>Yet, as the infamous list of the 19 hijackers was released by the FBI two days after the infamous event, and except for two feeble-minded patsies, no other perpetrator has ever been arrested for the greatest crime in American history, what kind of conclusions are we to draw from the fact that all of the people who were in charge of America when this dark day happened, instead of being fired for incompetence, were promoted and allowed to continue their criminal activity?</p>

<p>What does all this say about the American mind?</p>

<p>It is not functioning, thanks to the poisoned blanket of U.S. media, and a deliberately twisted educational system that has produced killer Jewish robots instead of fully invested philosophically clean humans.</p>

<p>Every cop in the world should be brought up on charges of willful obstruction of justice for not blowing the whistle on President George Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and all their Jewish handlers - in the White House, in the Congress, in the media, and most especially in the banks) for their stunningly criminal behavior in both lying about the events and implementing a totally illegal coverup of the crime scenes.</p>

<p>But the Jewish judges atop the U.S. legal system said it was all OK, and the media, led by the New York Times and CNN, never mentioned all those Jewish fingerprints visible in the pyroclastic dust covering the disintegrated corpses in the rubble of the Twin Towers.</p>

<p>In an interview only a mere weeks after 9/11, Hamid Gul - former head of Pakistani intelligence (ISI) from 1987-1989 - told Arnaud de Borchgrave, United Press International, of who he thinks was behind the attacks. Here are a few exceprts from the transcript:</p>

<p>De Borchgrave: So who did Black Sept. 11?</p>

<p>Gul: Mossad and its accomplices. The U.S. spends $40 billion a year on its 11 intelligence agencies. That&#39;s $400 billion in 10 years. Yet the Bush Administration says it was taken by surprise. I don&#39;t believe it. Within 10 minutes of the second twin tower being hit in the World Trade Center CNN said Osama bin Laden had done it. That was a planned piece of disinformation by the real perpetrators. It created an instant mindset and put public opinion into a trance, which prevented even intelligent people from thinking for themselves.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/">https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/</a></p>

<p>Immediately after the attacks Bin Laden was interviewed by Pakistani newspaper Ummat. When asked if he was involved in the attacks he stated:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children and other people. Such a practice is forbidden even in the course of a battle.&quot;</p>

<p>He went on to say:</p>

<p>&quot;In the same way, whether it is President Bush or any other U.S. President, they cannot bring Israel to justice for its human rights abuses or to hold it accountable for such crimes. What is this? Is it not that there exists a government within the government in the United States? That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks.&quot;</p>

<p>He further goes on to state:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that we are not hostile to the United States. We are against the [U.S. Government] system, which makes other nations slaves of the United States, or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom. This system is totally in the control of the American Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States. It is clear that the American people are themselves the slaves of the Jews and are forced to live according to the principles and laws laid down by them. So the punishment should reach Israel. In fact, it is Israel, which is giving a blood bath to innocent Muslims and the U.S. is not uttering a single word.&quot;</p>

<p>You know all this is true. You know you are living a lie every day, by accepting what the TV robots tell you is true.</p>

<p>Yet you wring your hands and kvetch that you don&#39;t know what to do, when in fact you do. You just don&#39;t have the courage to do it, because you&#39;re a robotized American dreckdroid, who goes out and kills other people for reasons simply because you have been ordered to by those who control you. Despicable. You are despicable, because you don&#39;t have the courage to say what you clearly know, even though you are about to lose everything you ever loved because of your failure to say what you know and confront the beast. And now it&#39;s too big to stop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely right.  Look up some [demolition fail] (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clEvOW6ABFE&amp;amp;t=46s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clEvOW6ABFE&amp;t=46s</a>) videos, and look at the demos on the large, multi-storey buildings.  In all these cases, if the explosive charges don&#39;t go off *perfectly*, severing all structural columns in multiple places, these buildings either topple to the side or undergo a partial collapse.  </p>

<p>So, how can a skyscraper like building 7 collapse into it&#39;s own footprint without a single core column being severed? It can&#39;t, it&#39;s not physically possible, it was a controlled demolition.</p>

<p>Logically I would agree. You would assume that that damaged area would fall off or collapse but since none of the lower structural integrity was compromised it should stay standing. But people way smarter than me say otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rational is long gone. I hate when anyone says men and women are equal. No they&#39;re not. In a plurality of countries, men and women have equal opportunities. That&#39;s different than being &quot;equal.&quot; One thing I like to point out is when I was working at a movie theater in high school, why did I have to bring/lift/carry/put away the 100 lb bags of kernels? Why did I have to take the trash out after dark? Why was i supposed to walk with a girl to her car after dark? Not that i disagree with doing any of this. It didn&#39;t bother me. Just stop saying we&#39;re equal because we&#39;re not. It isn&#39;t a bad thing. We&#39;re all just different </p>
