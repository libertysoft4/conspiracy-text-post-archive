        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Haven&#39;t been to this sub for awhile.   Visiting here today I was shocked to see that the &quot;Putin stole the American election!&quot; claptrap is everywhere.   Is the Pentagon running this sub now?  </p>

<p>The Putin-Trump fantasy is one of the most retarded conspiracy theories ever conceived by the American establishment.  It&#39;s right up there with &quot;Saddam Hussein is working with Al-Qaeda to nook Murika!   We must attack Iraq!&quot;   </p>

<p>You gotta love it.   Trump is awful on many levels -- but the one thing he does right, trying to re-establish peaceful relations with Russia -- is regarded by the establishment as his greatest sin.   So they concoct this preposterous conspiracy theory about Putin to derail a peaceful future with Russia and deflect attention from the actual &quot;hackers&quot; of the election -- the people who took out Bernie.</p>

<p>Imagine if the deplorable Democratic Party lackeys paid this much attention to Israel and that country&#39;s ACTUAL control over the American political establishment.  </p>

<p>Say what you will about flat-Earthers/Reptilian theorists; at least their ramblings are harmless.   The Trump/Russia conspiracy theory is not only profoundly goofy it is profoundly dangerous.   Everyone promoting it should be utterly ashamed of themselves.  </p>

<p>Yes let&#39;s increase the risk of global nuclear annihilation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you retarded?  No one <em>wants</em> a nuclear war.   The greatest danger of nuclear war has always been a series of fuckups caused by incompetence.   And there is nothing more incompetent that repeatedly poking a bear with a stick.  </p>

<p>George H.W. Bush promised to Gorbachev that NATO would not expand &quot;one inch to the East.&quot;   Instead the US tried to destroy the Russian economy via the Chicago school of economics, expanded NATO, and has repeatedly fomented &quot;color revolutions&quot; on Russia&#39;s doorstep.  </p>

<p>So yeah, some countries deserve sanctions.  The US for one.  Israel for another.  But not Russia.   </p>

<p>As for the US elections, which are largely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Ferguson_(academic">symbolic</a>) anyway, there is zero evidence that Russia influenced the Hillary defeat.   Wikileaks exposed the profound corruption inside the Democratic Party, sure; if the D&#39;s wanted to win they shouldn&#39;t have sabotaged Bernie.   </p>

<p>It&#39;s clear that Israel plays a massive role in US &quot;elections&quot; through APEC etc.   That&#39;s a major problem.   But Russia?  lol please.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol foreign powers are not necessary to &quot;destabilize the USA&quot;.   Corporations, banks, &quot;think tanks&quot;, quasi-&quot;philanthropic&quot; foundations -- basically the ruling class a whole -- are more than sufficient.   That&#39;s what they do: divide and conquer the American populace, get people squabbling over identity politics, ship the jobs overseas, steal all the money, slaughter people overseas and run laughing to the bank.  </p>

<p>I agree though that Israel poses a major threat to the remaining threads of stability that the US has left.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess Russia initiated the financial crisis of 2008 as well. Lot of people lost their savings, jobs, possessions, and still had to bail out the banks to the tune of $1 Trillion only to find out that the crisis was knowingly engineered. The real kicker is, nobody went to jail and a lot of already rich folks got even richer off it because the politicians everybody voted in, are on their payrolls! Yay Functional Democracy!

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed.    It reminds me of the tale of the thief who pickpockets a man&#39;s wallet, points some other guy and yells &quot;thief!&quot;  </p>

<p>When it doubt, find a scapegoat.   This scapegoat can be either internal or external.   Eg &quot;look at that minority group, they&#39;re ruining our society!&quot; or it can be &quot;look at that foreign country, those people are awful!   They&#39;re ruining our society!&quot;  etc.   The latter strategy is dangerous enough with small powers; doing it with Russia is just insane.   </p>

<p>Of course the ruling class itself is global.   They have profound class solidarity, they don&#39;t care about identity politics except as a tool of manipulation, and they are probably the one minority that people should be truly concerned about.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. But that doesn&#39;t mean that foreign powers aren&#39;t playing the game, too - as you&#39;ve pointed out, the US government is guilty of this as well. And Russia&#39;s plan is well documented in that book. It&#39;s amazing - you can watch it play out line by line.

    <div class="md"><p>No matter what anyone has to say about the US intelligence community, who they support, who pays them, who really runs the show or all of the nefarious things they have done over the years. (which is a lot, news flash, you don&#39;t become a global super power without getting your hands dirty) </p>

<p><em>None</em> of that changes the fact that the GOP has been obviously on the take by laundering dirty foreign money through the NRA into their coffers. This whole &quot;don&#39;t trust the deep state&quot; meme is all propaganda to cover their ass. That party had no fucking problem with the deep state when WMD&#39;s were found. Mostly every American I knew then supported that shit, and now suddenly these same people can&#39;t trust the law enforcement agencies that caught them with their hand in the Kremlin cookie jar?</p>

<p>What do you think that money buys those foreign interests? So far to me it looks like it&#39;s bought them a vast network of anti American propaganda to brainwash the population of the US. Rush Limbaugh has been screaming into his microphone for fucking 30 years about how evil the system that he has become fat and happy on is. </p>

<p>Where is this America first crowd that was so prominent during 2016? The same people who supported that flag waving bullshit are actively trying to tear down the fabric of the nation by throwing the baby out with the bath water and attacking the institutions that bring the rule of law to a democracy. </p>

<p>You know what? Yes, the CIA, the FBI and US/Global deep politics exist and do nasty, evil, rotten things. So does every other country in every other part of the world. Ever see a mob boss climb the ladder without blood on his hands? </p>

<p><em>I&#39;m fucking American</em> and I happen to have been shot out of a vagina here. Supporting violence and evil is part of the fucking deal if you eat, fuck, and shit here and call it your home. Every single luxury any American has ever been afforded has come from violence from day one. Pretending like it hasn&#39;t is a joke. </p>

<p>All of this moral high ground bullshit that is suddenly against everything the intelligence community has ever done is hypocritical and a smoke screen for the bad actors that happen to be caught in the cross hairs right now. </p>

<p>Congrats, if you&#39;re American you live high on the hog from your country crushing others. This comes as a surprise now? Give me a break. </p>

<p>Trump is just too divisive to be a good president imo. The president should unite the population to make the country strong. Not sow division for political ends. </p>

<p>Quite frankly the job is <em>way</em> above his mental capabilities and he struggles with the most basic parts of the job. For instance who is in NATO or who is an ally and I don&#39;t know, what else? Spelling? That&#39;s personally where my Trump hate comes from, he isn&#39;t fit. The office is way above him.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve actually watched that video before, I listen to most of Trump&#39;s speeches as a matter of fact. I would go as far as to say I actually enjoy listening to him. I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that his speeches play so well because he says all the right things while actually following through with none of it. He cares very, very little about the people other than using them as a means to his ends. IMO that&#39;s a mind game, he tells people what they want to hear and is a master manipulator.  </p>

<p>What the GOP has done has nothing to do with those principles he harps on in the video. They have staged an illegal coupe on the US government imo.  </p>

<p>I respect your opinion, but sadly we will never come together on this issue since our views of the man are at completely opposite ends of the spectrum. You see a savior, I see a pawn of pure evil. </p>

<p>Hopefully time will tell what&#39;s real and what isn&#39;t and we all can come together as a country and world in peace after all of this.  </p>

<p>Most, yes.   But with some sports it requires a certain amount of artistry: eg basketball.   And it&#39;s virtually impossible to rig a tennis match unless one guy decides to take the fall; but today&#39;s tennis people are hardcore, and think they&#39;r artists.   </p>

<p>If anything is worth posting here, it&#39;s the conspiracy of why <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is expected to act like <a href="/r/The_Donald2">/r/The_Donald2</a>.0 and if it doesn&#39;t, you think it&#39;s a new conspiracy against you.</p>

<p>lol. It is literally no more proven true today than it was the day Hillary made it up.</p>

<p>So, that <a href="https://www.fox47news.com/newsy/did-donald-trump-just-ask-russia-to-hack-hillary-clintons-emails">wasn&#39;t Donald Trump who said</a> &quot;Russia, if you&#39;re listening, I hope you&#39;re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.

<p>In case that link&#39;s video doesn&#39;t work, here&#39;s an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQb2S4DIcNc">alternative link.</a></p>

<p>Cause it seems to me if anyone started the idea that Trump colluded with Russia, it would be Trump when he said that in front of a crowd and on national TV.</p>

<p>Yep. Anybody rational, informed, and honest knows that.</p>

<p>He said that to mock Hillary who was accusing him of colluding with Russia.</p>

<p>Like I said, you seem pretty disconnected from reality. Like right here, you say I&#39;m not even in the context of the conversation - yet I&#39;m the top level comment and have a transcript of the entire chain readily available above this very box that I&#39;m typing. You just said I said something that anyone can verify I just didn&#39;t...</p>

<p>Unless you intend to start making some sense, you really can&#39;t expect me to continue to sit here and point this silliness out any more.</p>
