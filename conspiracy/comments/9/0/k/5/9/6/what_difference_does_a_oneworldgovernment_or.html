        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>To the anarchists and the anti-one-world-government proponents, how do you live in peace? I cherish the freedoms I have also. But unless you&#39;re truly &quot;off the grid&quot; (which very few humans do, despite their claims), you can&#39;t afford to enforce every contract you enter into. I certainly can&#39;t. </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t count on contracts being enforced, the economy gets paralyzed out of fear. Everyone becomes a thief when the justice system disappears. I have my issues with authority like anyone else--including authorities--but I&#39;m not foolish enough to want to live in a world without them.</p>

<p>So here we are: not quite a 1WG, but international trade trends ever toward it. Sure, there&#39;re going to be several iterations, variations of trading partners and spheres of economic security, but something like a 1WG will eventually win out. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard a 1WG was a terrible thing for literally decades. Alex Jones and others shout their protests against the &quot;Amero&quot; (unified North American currency) every now and then. But the size of the state in question, it&#39;s simply irrelevant to me. Am I under-reacting?</p>

<p>What seems exponentially more important are the rules that the state must follow and the legal mechanisms that regulate state powers. Shouldn&#39;t the rules of the state take precedence over the size of the state?</p>

<p>Good question.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Maybe. But it&#39;s an appeal to tribalism. Would it break your heart if your kids spoke another language? It doesn&#39;t keep me up at night. But the way you&#39;re imaging it, it won&#39;t work like that. There will be larger and larger spheres of influence until there are only 2 or 3 for a long time, then there will be one. But that&#39;s a long way down the road. Maybe 80 years? None of this happens quickly.</p>

<p>I will concede that the further you go towards the north of the UK, the differences are less obvious. Especially in places with large Irish immigrant populations, such as Liverpool. </p>

<p>We also dont have anywhere near the large Caribbean influence that the UK has (which sits at about 6% in UK, 1.1% in Ireland)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true. Maybe I&#39;m being optimistic, but the homogenizing effect would put a premium on &quot;exotic&quot;. So places would be motivated to keep their flavor.

<p>I would personally be happy to live under a set of libertarian type rules. Outside of Laws that protect people, I have no need for them. I can enforce my own contracts when needed and I deal with cash or trade. </p>

<p>But can you guaranteee that the other 7.5 billion would be happy with those rules? And if not, do we change the rules to suit others? And what if I dont agree with the new rules? </p>

<p>As it currently stands, I can pretty much choose what culture that I want to live in. All it takes is a visa and a little cash (and will power) on my part.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again I agree with you. I think society is a beast that probably can&#39;t be tamed in its current inception. But I also believe that removing sovereignty and self-determination, removes a part of who/what we are. and i feel that the removal of the human element, has us at this place in time that does not work for the majority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are at a point where a government does not need to exist in the form that we have currently.  We elect people to represent us in decision making. They run on plateforms to get elected then have little accountability to the electorate, other than re-election.  One of the most significant reasons for this is cost of ballots and electoral audits.  We now have a public system that allows for voting with little costs is auditable and secure.  We can thank the potential world currency for this - Bitcoin.  Or some other blockchain system.  So contemplate an accountable system of voting that is public and secure.  You could potentially vote and finance government without the corruption of individuals, it could be borderless and tied to currency.  I won&#39;t go into detail. But truly believe we may be on the verge of a system that revolutionizes democracy and brings meaningful voting back to the people.</p>

<p>Are you an oil exec? If not, that&#39;s not what the PCA means for regular people. The fact is that burning fossil fuels has an extra cost called Carbon. That&#39;s just a fact of life. Up until PCA (mostly), that cost has been put on the public like a manufacturer dumping waste into the public swimming waters. At a point, the environment can&#39;t support swimming anymore or the manufacturer must close the loop. That costs money. The only question is WHO WILL END UP PAYING? You and me or the companies where records profits are being made?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, this is one half of the trade-off. The other half is that they will enforce contracts. Or, you&#39;re free to disconnect yourself from the grid. It&#39;s not impossible, but most people don&#39;t have the grit for it. Me, I like restaurants and vacations and dog parks and public education (gasp!). Go for it. Let&#39;s see how you feel when you need dialysis. I&#39;m going to the fancy liquor store. Go ahead and take my picture. IDGAF. But I should be able to see my complete record if I so choose--especially if being brought before the justice system. Those kinds of rules are important.</p>

<p>International trade is already proceeding perfectly fine without centralized contract enforcer - your American court doesn&#39;t have legal jurisdiction over a Chinese seller you are ordering goods from. In case of bigger, more complicated transactions both parties usually agree beforehand on a single, reputable Arbitral Tribunal to resolve their possible disputes and this solution also works well since medieval Merchant Laws.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t want a world without Law and Justice, we want to introduce these competitive solutions inside national borders to improve over corrupted, state &quot;Justice&quot; systems. Centralized law enforcement is to be wholly replaced by private, competing security and insurance agencies (which even currently are being commonly employed by everybody who really needs protection or expects to be the victim of thievery) and a competing system of private courts. Removing whole libraries of victimless crimes from our legal system is to be expected since no one in his right mind would be voluntarily paying for the enforcement of, for example, drug laws.     </p>

<p>True. But it wasn&#39;t that long ago that Germans were sinking/shooting down merchant ships and planes of their enemies. The waters between America and China are patrolled by some combination of Chinese and US military authorities. If they weren&#39;t, these vehicles would be robbed, blockaded, blown up and sunk. The military polices these routes through agreements like TPP. That&#39;s the point of these treaties. The part of the contract being enforced here is protection. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Any justice system is prone to corruption. It&#39;s the rules that make it more or less so, no? For sure, a system that allows untraceable money in unlimited amounts is going to exacerbate corruption compared to one in which all donations must be public.</p>

<p>These kinds of systems have been tried. In the places where only the wealthy have security, the middle class suffers the most and injustices prevail for the regular citizens. I&#39;m good with a reasonable amount of consolidation of power, so long as there&#39;s due process and a right to see the government&#39;s file on you. Private security is an artifact of wealth stratification. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not impossible. But it&#39;s not a practical idea or they&#39;re not going to be very specialized. You&#39;re asking local cops to be able to coordinate military security over far more advanced groups. It&#39;s not going to end well for the local cops. These places will be absorbed into the larger, more militarily powerful systems, except in some outlier cases.</p>

<p>The problem with 100% privatization is that some jobs are better accomplished without profit motives. Prisons shouldn&#39;t be for-profit operations because we see that they spend money to lobby for longer prison sentences and more prisonable offenses. This is their fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders. The CEO&#39;s priorities are with the board members, not to public safety. This doesn&#39;t help the rest of society in the least. This pattern repeats with all these other institutions if they become privatized.</p>

<p>Healthcare, medicines, education, prisons and utilities are some areas where profit motives should be closely regulated and successful results (good quality care, smart kids, good cost-for-outcome ratios, low recidivism rates, etc) should be incentivized. Otherwise bad outcomes get incentivized. We&#39;ve seen it over and over again. Count on it like clockwork. Leave the door open for cutting corners on safety or quality, be it through waste management or worker safety or consumer safety, and corporations would gladly pass those costs onto someone else and never look back.</p>

<p>Of course we&#39;re being lied to about the reasons, but the fact is the money has to keep moving in order to have an economy. Trade routes are ultimately military agreements to protect these routes. That&#39;s why the big dicks at the negotiating table are the strongest militaries. It would be ideal to make all rules local and enforce them with local enforcers, I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s impractical for most, but not all, countries to stand alone during the next few phases of consolidation, but most places depend on entities larger than their local law enforcement to make sure business keeps on keeping on.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Rock solid document. If it were followed. It&#39;s clearly not at this point. Not since the Patriot Act, Military Commissions Act, NDAA, and of course, CITIZENS UNITED. These laws and rulings circumvent the Constitution. We are now living in a post-Constitutional America. We are ruled by corporations, and we all accept that reality if we&#39;re paying attention. Now what? </p>

<p>There are legal remedies. At this point, the process of creating Constitutional amendments appears to be the most realistic--however difficult it is on paper--to first get money out of politics. After that, the stacked courts are going to make legal victories scarce but possible.</p>

<p>I still think blockchain voting is the best remedy for voter fraud. Lots of questions about the formation of it would need to be answered, but it would definitely be a net benefit to the country.</p>

<p>Good question.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Going by majority rule wouldn&#39;t work out well for americans or any english speaking people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe. But it&#39;s an appeal to tribalism. Would it break your heart if your kids spoke another language? It doesn&#39;t keep me up at night. But the way you&#39;re imaging it, it won&#39;t work like that. There will be larger and larger spheres of influence until there are only 2 or 3 for a long time, then there will be one. But that&#39;s a long way down the road. Maybe 80 years? None of this happens quickly.</p>

<p>Why could it not be the option and decision for local governments to send $ and or people for a noble fleet of trade protectionists?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not impossible. But it&#39;s not a practical idea or they&#39;re not going to be very specialized. You&#39;re asking local cops to be able to coordinate military security over far more advanced groups. It&#39;s not going to end well for the local cops. These places will be absorbed into the larger, more militarily powerful systems, except in some outlier cases.</p>

<p>The problem with 100% privatization is that some jobs are better accomplished without profit motives. Prisons shouldn&#39;t be for-profit operations because we see that they spend money to lobby for longer prison sentences and more prisonable offenses. This is their fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders. The CEO&#39;s priorities are with the board members, not to public safety. This doesn&#39;t help the rest of society in the least. This pattern repeats with all these other institutions if they become privatized.</p>

<p>Healthcare, medicines, education, prisons and utilities are some areas where profit motives should be closely regulated and successful results (good quality care, smart kids, good cost-for-outcome ratios, low recidivism rates, etc) should be incentivized. Otherwise bad outcomes get incentivized. We&#39;ve seen it over and over again. Count on it like clockwork. Leave the door open for cutting corners on safety or quality, be it through waste management or worker safety or consumer safety, and corporations would gladly pass those costs onto someone else and never look back.</p>

<p>Why are there pirates or rogue militaries attacking trade routes in the first place? Is it because those peoples&#39; in other continents have governments that have sold their resources from under the people, and they have motive and little other options to produce a living? <strong>Is this condition left over from previous colonial exploits?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There will always be thieves and psychopaths and mercenaries trying to get something for nothing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>...but I don&#39;t believe MOST people WANT to have to kill people - whether illegally of legally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, total agreement. People mostly just want to live simple lives with their family and friends and professions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What if we are being lied to about the reasons that we collectively are going into debt for these wars, and it will never actually benefit you or those countries&#39; citizens?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course we&#39;re being lied to about the reasons, but the fact is the money has to keep moving in order to have an economy. Trade routes are ultimately military agreements to protect these routes. That&#39;s why the big dicks at the negotiating table are the strongest militaries. It would be ideal to make all rules local and enforce them with local enforcers, I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s impractical for most, but not all, countries to stand alone during the next few phases of consolidation, but most places depend on entities larger than their local law enforcement to make sure business keeps on keeping on.</p>
