        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>All of the Russia talk really had no legs until about 4 days ago. Now Trump has handled all this so poorly in the past 4 days, and shit has REALLY hit the fan. If youre going to be politically incorrect and controversial, you cant make any mistakes. He&#39;s made enormous mistakes and shit has snowballed very quickly and is becoming an avalanche. It was all talk and tweets and rhetoric, and now there substance to it. His enemies smell blood in the water and there&#39;s no turning back. My prediction- Trump will resign next month because of the &quot;appearance of impropreity&quot; What happens then? President Pence which will be interesting to say the least. </p>

<p>For the record, I actually voted for Trump, and I&#39;m not saying this because I am a partisan. My vote was more against Hillary and a feeling of &quot;why not? lets see what he can do.&quot;</p>

<p>There has been a lot of hate, exaggeration and rhetoric on both sides, but this in my opinion was the biggest most indesputible mistake Trump has made as president. This has legs and is brewing very quickly and I dont think he will recover.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I pretty much agree with everything you said, except I don&#39;t think Trump will resign, he will have to be dragged out of his office kicking and screaming before he quits.  Trump is too stubborn and too prideful to ever publicly admit defeat. </p>

<p>The only thing that might make him quit would be Putin releasing whatever kompromat he has on him, but I don&#39;t think Vlad would ever give up his leverage while Trump is in office...if anything he&#39;d release the pedo pee pee tape on Trump&#39;s way out of office just to embarrass America.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad Hillary lost, but I&#39;m ready for this joke to be out of office.  I could deal with that closet case Mike Pence for a couple years...he&#39;d be a lame duck until 2020.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If putin has shit he would of released it by now, trump selling arms to Ukrainians, dispelling Russian diplomats yatta yatta. It could all be theater. </p>

<p>As a leftie I will go ahead and say I’d rather trump just whine and pout till 2020. I think mike pence would cave to the military industrial complex immediately and we would go back to some stupid war. Also roe v wade would be eviscerated, along with public amenities such as Medicaid and social security.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not entirely sure the average Joe is going to go Left because of Trump, at most they&#39;ll just be pro-anyone else. The Left is handling Trump about as poorly as they can and they continuously push for special treatment for fringe demographic group benefits. </p>

<p>If anything, the left should be building a platform for 2020. Go fully moderate; give up globalism, give up on identity politics, and shift the focus to helping the everyday person. The left can be workers rights and not pro-corporations, but they&#39;ve pretty much became the &quot;get votes from as many people as possible&quot; party</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Backing down to Putin the way he did. I think that offended even his most core base. The whole platform is America first. The mistake was miscalculating and then making it worse by saying he meant to say &quot;wouldnt&quot; instead of &quot;would.&quot; I dont think a lot of people saw the whole press conference to get the context. The reporter put him on the spot and made him choose between his own intelligence apparatus and Putin, and he basically said he believed Putin more. He has since tried to say he mis-spoke, but it was pretty clear given the context. That was an enormous mistake and I think unlike all the other BS controversies, he will actually pay for this.</p>

<p>People can hate on him for his tweets, his immigration stance, his supposed ethnocentrism, but at least in all those instances he can claim he is doing it on behalf of America. When he allows for even the slightest perception that he might be making decisions in the interest of Putin instead of the interest of the US, he has a very serious problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like &quot;Gotcha&quot; journalism. Most people won&#39;t care. The way Trump has been micro-analyzed makes him immune to actual criticism, especially from the press. The only way they could get anything to stick to him would be if they all randomly started heralding his praise, that&#39;s how fed up Americans are with the press at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How often is there new info on &quot;classical&quot; conspiracies like aliens/cryptozoology/crop circles/etc to where there&#39;s stuff to post about every day? Yeah, US politics 24/7 isn&#39;t as cool as &quot;history as you know it is wrong,&quot; but it&#39;s current and new and developing. Classical stuff is like saying &quot;Who&#39;s better, Jerry Rice or TO?&quot; They&#39;re alright to talk about, but they&#39;re just talking points. You can have the conversation every day, but it&#39;s the same thing until there&#39;s something new into the equation</p>
