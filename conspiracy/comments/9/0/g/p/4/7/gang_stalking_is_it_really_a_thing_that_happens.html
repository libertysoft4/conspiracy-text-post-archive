<p>19 online accounts stolen in 8 months, all different emails and passwords. My company affords my protection against this.</p>

<p>Spare magnetic key stolen off truck frame, magnetic case still there key gone</p>

<p>Deactivated debit and credit cards without warning.</p>

<p>Changed locks and gum stuck in keyhole, nice neighborhood </p>

<p>Kids shoe stolen several times. Just one shoe from each pair off back porch. </p>

<p>Loud bang on door early in mornings 3-4 am no person spotted after going downstairs. Probably 12 times over 8 months.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the really weird one. Two private cells receiving dozens of calls per day all asking to speak to Craig. Two separate accounts one corporate and the other personal. Block numbers and different number in different area codes call. </p>

<p>Any body else experienced anything like this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Start writing everything down as it happens.  Like this,</p>

<p>July 20th 9am: I went to use my spare truck key to discover it was missing from the magnetic case.</p>

<p>Do the same thing for all the other incidents so that you have a more reliable record of what happened.  The banging on the door, gum in keyhole, shoes stolen could be the work of asshole kids and is coincidentally happening the same time as the more serious stuff.  A camera at your front and back door can weed out who might be doing that or deterring them in the first place.  </p>

<p>The online accounts being stolen and people messing with your cards could be a case of identity theft.  Someone couldn&#39;t easily do that without somehow impersonating you and having enough information to fool the bank or get by any sort of security questions that websites use to reset passwords.  You should report those instances to the police with some documentation if you can get it.  </p>

<p>I personally would go in to the police mainly with the ID theft stuff.  It&#39;s the most serious thing happening and can do the most damage.  You can also mention the other harassment going on, but it may or may not be related so I&#39;d consider it a secondary concern and most of the attention should be on the ID theft.  I would worry that if you came right out with gang stalking out of the gate because it might be taken less seriously.  There&#39;s a decent amount of gang stalking stories that read more like the person is suffering from a mental illness rather than a vast conspiracy to mess with them (not in your case, all this stuff is quite plausible comparatively, even the &quot;minor&quot; harrassment).</p>

<p>Good Luck!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be, could just be a little paranoia as suggested by others. I know the accounts thing could be contributed to massive data breaches but it does seem rather targeted but as a guy who likes conspiracy I&#39;m aware of my own bias.

    <div class="md"><p>Dude first of all your edit...your post didn&#39;t get buried just because it&#39;s not on the front page after 2 hours. Currently on my 2nd page at 19 upvotes, relax. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t add &quot;this post getting buried&quot; to your &#39;gangstalking&#39; list...</p>

<p>But IF all of this shit is really happening then buy security cameras and go to the police to report next time something happens. Wouldn&#39;t hurt to start carrying a legal PDW for whatever state you&#39;re in if you&#39;re really paranoid. </p>

<p>Should probably go get yourself checked out in case that you&#39;re losing it a bit. I hate saying I don&#39;t believe people but going simply off your word it seems like a 50/50 that it&#39;s in your head. I&#39;ve had a friend go through this a few years back</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Either way just cause it&#39;s at zero doesn&#39;t mean anything. Do you know how many people come to conspiracy forums and ask about this specific issue and get the same responses every time? Theres noting anyone here can do for you tbh. </p>

<p>I understand you FEEL like there might be a problem with someone following you/fucking with you. But based on how similarll you posts is to tons of others like this I would honestly recommend going to talk to someone. </p>

<p>Sorry if this doesn&#39;t support what you think but even based on what you said there&#39;s nothing of importance you&#39;ve ever done to attract a group or person to stalk you. There are probably thousands and thousands of people on various lists that are anti-government/pro-conspiracy that would get fucked with before you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although it hardly explains some of the things you&#39;ve said, you <em>may</em> be experiencing carbon monoxide poisoning. It is a long shot but you never know, and it is definitely worth checking if you&#39;re truly worried about these strange occurrences. Symptoms of CO poisoning include paranoia. <strong>Be sure to immediately check your heating systems for a possible leak.</strong></p>

They basically just said the same advice I was given here record all events I&#39;m detail. Invest in some cameras.

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I think the best way to deal with gangstalking is to fuck with them.  Set up cameras around the house, put a gps tracker in your kids&#39; shoe, anything to set a trap and gather evidence.  Obviously they want to keep their identity secret, so make yourself formidable and not worth the risk of exposure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Targeted individual here- My research may interest you. 
See: Wyoming Incident.
Do you undeestand the subject of One? The unity of You? I&#39;m referring to incepted paranoia- Those who do not possess the knowledge can not comprehend the context I speak of. Often referred to as &quot;elevated frequency&quot;. </p>

<p>About my experiences:
I have been drugged, I have been phished, but the brunt of it went to my ex girlfriend... Who has been asssulted on multiple occasions... and drugged into psychosis. I lost contact with her but know who she assosciates with. They also have a part to play with my experiences.</p>

<p>My local authorities treated me as the criminal. Local authorities here very much collude with the hells angels biker gang. 
Contact me. I am about afraid to speak up as I am to die... Ive arrived to my suspects doorsteps. I can educate you.</p>
