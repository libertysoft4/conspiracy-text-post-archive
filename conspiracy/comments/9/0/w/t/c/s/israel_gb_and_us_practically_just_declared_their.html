    <div class="md"><p>The US cant really do shit against Iran tho.  Iran is an inhospitable and mountainous country of 80 million people, and thanks to our sanctions they have spent the past couple decades learning how to survive on their own without any kind of foreign trade or support (as well as preparing their countryside to fend off the seemingly inevitable US/Israeli invasion).  Also,  they are surrounded by nations that would likely be sympathetic to their cause (Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan).</p>

<p>A real war against Iran would be catastrophic for the US,  such a war would make Iraq look quaint in comparison.  The losses from an invasion of Iran would be at least a full order of magnitude higher than what we have experienced in the entire so-called &quot;war on terror&quot; thus far.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody has done it for a reason,  its not possible to win a war through aerial bombing alone. This is a country that has had a target on their back for the past 40 years,  you really think they arent prepared for a bombing campaign?  </p>

<p>Iran is a mountainous nation with a population around 80 million. It would take a LOT of bombing to reduce them to a state where &quot;nobodys left&quot; (especially considering the people will all hide in their mountains at the first sign of violence)... but they wont ever get reduced to this state as no nation on earth has enough social capital to get away with killing tens of millions innocent civilians in cold blood anyway.  </p>

<p>Libya was not remotely &quot;won&quot;,  unless your idea of freedom is open air slave markets.  At best we delivered Libya from the hands of one dictator into the hands of many smaller dictators... what a victory.  </p>

<p>Iran is like a version of Afghanistan with 3x as many people, but the people are actually united as a nation.  Unlike Afghanistan in 2001,  the Iranians have had almost 20 years to prepare for this invasion.  Invading Iran would be an absolute clusterfuck.  </p>

<p>You obviously have no understanding of modern warfare (or the world in general).

In fact the past couple decades of US sanctions are one of the reasons Iran is such a formidable target today,  while most nations import military equipment from developed western nations,  Iran has been forced to build their own shit for the past ~40 years. Unlike Iraq, Afghanistan, and all our other recent middle eastern conquests,  Iran actually has the ability to produce their own arms and ammunition.  Iran also has their own domestic supply of oil,  their own food supply,  and 80 million people...</p>

<p>You are vastly underestimating our miltiary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dude, the only reality in which what you are suggesting is even <strong><em>remotely possible</em></strong> would be if all the conspiracy theories of the U.S. having UFO tech are true. In the real world, with our current tech, there is no &quot;going nuclear&quot; without immediate and terrifying reprisal from other nuclear powers. Since Russia and Iran are allied, it doesn&#39;t seem to be the case that an invasion would be sanctioned by them. </p>

<p>Because of that, it&#39;s <em>also rather likely</em> that Iran has access to Russia&#39;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/21/hypersonic-weapons-what-they-are-and-why-us-cant-defend-against-them.html">hypersonic cruise missiles</a> which currently are more than capable of penetrating our missile defenses. </p>

<p>So</p>

<p>1) There is nothing in our arsenal that allows us to &quot;pound Iran to rubble from 1000 miles offshore&quot; except for ICBMs or long range bombardment via plane (safe when bombing Cambodia and Laos into the stone age, not so when facing a modern opponent with an air force)</p>

<p>2) Even if we did attempt a coastal bombardment like that (from closer, obviously), do the math on this: one $100M hypersonic cruise missle vs one $4.5B Nimitz class carrier. Who wins? </p>

<p>Hint: it&#39;s Iran. P.s. the $100M estimate was pulled from my asshole- for all I know, their missiles are even cheaper. A Tomahawk is about $1.5M. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US has been trying to destabilize Iran through sanctions since 1979,  it hasnt worked yet and I dont think its going to start working any time soon.  In fact the past couple decades of US sanctions are one of the reasons Iran is such a formidable target today,  while most nations import military equipment from developed western nations,  Iran has been forced to build their own shit for the past ~40 years. Unlike Iraq, Afghanistan, and all our other recent middle eastern conquests,  Iran actually has the ability to produce their own arms and ammunition.  Iran also has their own domestic supply of oil,  their own food supply,  and 80 million people...</p>
