        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Shit is ridiculous, as I am definitely not a holocaust denier. I believe it happened and believe that millions were killed.</p>

<p>I was banned for posting the following quote from a recent article on Salon about how <a href="/r/askhistorians">/r/askhistorians</a> bans holocaust deniers.</p>

<p>The Salon article said that one of the main arguments that holocaust deniers make is that &quot;The number of Jews killed by the Nazis was far lower than 6 million,&quot; and then listed a few other reasons.</p>

<p>The article continued:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Taken together or separately, these beliefs serve one goal: to make the ideas of the Nazis socially acceptable. The Holocaust is the obvious proof that the ideology of National Socialism is, at its core, racist, anti-Semitic, and genocidal. Holocaust denial erases this massive crime to blunt the horror of Nazi ideas as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My my concern with that quote is that I do not see how one can logically conclude that someone who is questioning the exact number of people killed in the holocaust is attempting to make the ideas of Nazis socially acceptable. </p>

<p>My comment that got me banned is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How does believing that the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust is actually far less than 6 million, perhaps 2 million, equate a desire to make Nazis socially acceptable?</p>

<p>That&#39;s kind of an absurd thing to say. Not everyone who questions the accuracy of mainstream history supports Nazis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t holocaust denial, right? Am I wrong about this? What the hell is going on with these moderators?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was not holocaust denial. Your comment just gave them the impression you are someone who secretely denies the holy six million (as you are defending the idea that’s not equivalent to Nazi apologism).</p>

<p>Truth can be antisemitic in this day and age. For example, no budget, order or plan was ever found for the holocaust - mainstream historians are perfectly free to debate whether top-Nazi brass ordered, or even <em>wanted</em> it to happen.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism_versus_intentionalism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism_versus_intentionalism</a></p>

<p>Try bringing up this historiographical debate in a social setting. You’ll be branded a Nazi.</p>

<p>Nor can you evoke the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_%28sacrifice%29">etymology of the word</a> Holocaust.</p>

<p>And of course never <em>ever</em> mention the irrefutable truth that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7uesbo/im_going_to_explain_something_that_i_fear_many/">Zionism is the successor ideology to Nazism.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re the head of a warring nation actively taking territory and imprisoning minorities, and then those minorities start being killed while incarcerated after you hold a political meeting (Reich Chancellery Meeting of 12/12/41) asking for the elimination of said minority - only 3 years after authorizing the forced euthanasia (T-4 Euthanasia Program) of <em>at least</em> 70k mostly religiously-aligned citizens...</p>

<p>Ffs. Saying that there&#39;s no order or budget for the holocaust in mid-century Europe doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t make an evidence-based assertion on who carried it out or why. Saying that the truth is anti-semitic is like saying Watergate was simply information gathering, since there was no official budget or written order. </p>

<p>its probably a magnitude less than six million murdered, but the various millions forcibly displaced is still technically genocide. people die when imprisoned and are transported about like cattle. not to mention the thefts of property and lives disrupted and ruined.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I see a fallacy here that we all regularly commit. We make some effort to be reasonable and perhaps improve our ideas, then we wonder why those ideas aren&#39;t accepted by others. Our irritation is especially aggravated when our ideas are rejected by someone who wields some power. We expect power to increase with being reasonable, but our experience frustrates that expectation.</p>

<p>If we look at how a person becomes, for example, a moderator of a subReddit, we can realize that the growth of ideas isn&#39;t required in the same way that we have worked to grow our ideas. It is just necessary to continue growing and become more aware and to have a constant effect on the world that doesn&#39;t focus on other peoples&#39; filters.</p>

<p>of course many of those are population estimates.</p>

<p>and of course, as it typical of the denier clown mentality, no other number was selected.</p>

<p>What relevance would any other number have?  6 million has always been the number associated with the Holocaust.  4 million was always associated with Auschwitz.  Turns out theyre both lies.  </p>

<p>Just like that little piece of copypasta you didn&#39;t question, lmao gr8 b8 m8</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What relevance would any other number have?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Answer the question.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve actually done your research and have found out how many times any other number has come up right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll wait.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>6 million has always been the number associated with the Holocaust</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4 million was always associated with Auschwitz</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it hasn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Turns out theyre both lies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Turns out you actually don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. Colour me surprised.</p>

<p>Try doing some research first. Lol</p>

<p>You have no argument, you just so desperately want the official narrative to be true even when theres evidence to the contrary.  Sad!</p>

<p>As, stated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No it hasn&#39;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that one plaque was never part of <em>any</em> Holocaust estimate. It was never part of the earliest estimates coming out just after the war, nor any of the others thereafter- ones which didn&#39;t show much difference between dates.</p>

<p>So yeah, try doing some research first. Lol</p>

<p>I see you, in typical clown fashion, still haven&#39;t answered my question.</p>
