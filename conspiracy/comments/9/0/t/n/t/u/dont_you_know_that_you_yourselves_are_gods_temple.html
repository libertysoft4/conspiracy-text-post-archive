    <div class="md"><p>Those weren&#39;t God&#39;s instructions in Judges 21, the elders of the assembly gave them the instructions. Also this was when the Israelites were doing their own thing, aka not following God&#39;s word. They were a fickle bunch throughout the Bible, if you didn&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Also, if you look into the Book of Enoch you will realize that the only time God killed was when the beings were a wicked abomination of His Creation. For example, the offspring of the Nephilim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. For who knows a person’s thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.  What we have received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand what God has freely given us.  This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words. <em>The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit.</em> The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments, for, “Who has known the mind of the LORD so as to instruct him?”</p>

<p>But we have the mind of Christ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>basically, put simply in the old testament, After adam even sinned against God, you had the fall of man.  The only person left eventually that even acknowledged God at all, was Noah.  So God destroys the Earth by Flood. Everybody, drowns them.  So First off, i&#39;m a little desensitized to thinking God is mean.  The fact that he&#39;s let us live at all, is a blessing.  Supposing that he is the divine creator, which you may not, that is your choice.  </p>

<p>God&#39;s purpose was to bring a remnant through history, to get to Jesus.  Then Jesus comes And there is a new covenant, the grace covenant.</p>

<p>Like it or not, in the ancient world, war was abhorrent and abundant, There were barbaric peoples that worshipped foreign gods and idols.  The bible is the story of Israel, Jehovah&#39;s people.  They were constantly being attacked, sometimes in captivity, and sometimes they were living in abudance in obedience to God.  At any rate, they were like a roller coaster, but we can clearly see that God&#39;s purpose was to bring them along through history, that they would survive and carry on the legacy and ultimately get to the point in history where Jesus comes and is sacrificed for the sin of all man kind.  </p>

<p>So what youre referring to is one instance, where God told his people to go out and decimate/take over a barbaric people/tribe.  If they did not, they would have been killed, or down the road they would have ultimately suffered because of it.  We see this happen in the bible when Israel lets a tribe &quot;slide&quot; in good faith, and doesn&#39;t destroy the remnant.  </p>

<p>The tribe in question that God instructed his pepole Israel to take by force and take their women, destroy their children, and basically over take their culture, was a tribe that was so evil they threw babies up in the air and let them land on spears.  So  I&#39;m not saying it was pretty, i&#39;m not saying you have to like it or agree with it or understand it.  I don&#39;t.  I see that it was brutal.  But i don&#39;t question God.  I don&#39;t look at it as right or wrong, I look at it as history.  And God&#39;s people had to take out other tribes and decimate them to survive.  This was the way it was. Kill or be killed.  I can&#39;t justify it, but we do know that this was the way God operated back then, Now we are under a new covenant a grace covenant where we do not live like that any more.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus christ, so much Stockholm syndrome.</p>

<p>Sure, God created everything from nothing in 7 days, but the only way to help &quot;his people&quot; (not you) was to enslave them for awhile, run em around in a desert for 40 years, and then genocide their way through somebody else&#39;s land.</p>

<p>Makes complete sense.  He could&#39;ve made them their own Canaan in what... 2 days?  But nope.  God loves blood and killing.  And he&#39;s even convinced you to hate your own humanity, on top of it.  What a guy.  So nice of him to let (some of) us live.  Sometimes.  For awhile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you could just choose to do the right thing every day but you don&#39;t, but you probably say that you do, but you know you don&#39;t.  and you&#39;re mad at God because he doesn&#39;t give us all a free pass, well actually he did, you jsut have to believe.  Instead of wanting to play God yourself, and explain how he coulda shoulda done it.  I mean i agree, i&#39;m a human too.  why doesn&#39;t God just snap his fingers and send us all to heaven and take away all the pain? i mean if he&#39;s God, he can do that! I get it.  But i don&#39;t think its that simple.  But again, no one can answer the whys.  We just have to trust, his ways are above our ways, his thoughts are not our thoughts.  lean not on your own understanding and in all your ways acknowledge him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So now you know me?  I didn&#39;t know god gave you guys psychic powers.  I do try to do right, every day, with varying amounts of success.  But I don&#39;t need the threat of some magical sky-demon to get me to do it.  </p>

<p>And instead of lecturing me on the &quot;mysterious ways&quot; of god, you should learn to simply read your own bible.  I mean <em>really</em> read it.  It&#39;s a non-stop mess of genocide, vindictiveness, pettiness, and all sorts of vileness.  Just start from the beginning, and keep  an eye out for the countless atrocities of the one who convinced you to call him &quot;god&quot;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;ve read it several times buddy. I already said I understand your argument, you have a problem with the violence in the old testament.  Most people do.  You attribute it to God&#39;s pettiness, vindctiveness, etc.  thats your opinion, and your certainly entitled to it.  I didn&#39;t mean to imply that i know you personally, but we are all guilty of sin my brother.  This is God inside of us, establishing the difference between right and wrong, and try as we might, we all fall short.  And if the creator God, created us, and this world, then he alone reserves the right make the rules.  He offers us love and forgiveness.  Don&#39;t get hung up on the history of the Old testament, there was alot of blood shed, there still is today.  If God is real and sovereign, he makes the rules, we just don&#39;t have the right to question them.  If you continue to put the onus on a sovereign God to explain himself to you, then you will always fail to see him.  If you put the onus on yourself to see God, as the proper relationship should be between the creator and the created, then you will see him. </p>

<p>And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.  </p>

<p>I got no gripe with you brother, i honestly can say i Love you in the Lord.  and i hope your right and i&#39;m wrong.  I wasn&#39;t trying to judge you, i&#39;m just stating what is true and what the bible teaches.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it would be nice, but we&#39;re not robots.  God is not going to Force us to do anything.  We have free will.  You have to choose to Love or it isn&#39;t love at all.  And As far as I can tell God has kept his hands off as much as he can without totally interfering with free will, even though he remains sovereign and does interact with us and exert his will at times. It&#39;s complicated i know. But it&#39;s the only thing that i&#39;ve found thats real. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exodus Moses and The Kundalini Energy describes in detail how the Biblical scripture of Exodus has rich allegory surrounding this mystical spinal energy.</p>

<p>The lower mind (or carnal mind as the bible refers to) is mystically represented by EGYPT.</p>

<p>The ego which screams at us and keeps us in line = PHARAOH</p>

<p>Our spiritual impulse within that helps lead us out of bondage of the lower mind = MOSES.</p>

<p>KUNDALINI is an energy which rises up the spine. It is referred to as a female energy and a sleeping serpent. When it reaches the brain it impacts on the PINEAL GLAND which is a conduit for spiritual experiences during meditation.</p>

<p>A Moses grows he comes into conflict with the other aspects of us and he is driven out into the wilderness of meditation.</p>

<p>Moses talking to the burning bush representing being touched by the fire or spirit in meditation.</p>

<p>The stem of the bush is planted, the stem in the centre of the brain and we communicate with the fire which is spirit.</p>

<p>It is difficult for religious people to deal with our spiritual realisations. Moses indicates that people of the time will not believe him.</p>

<p>If we take the bible literally and believe that God created women out of the rib of Adam then it shows how far away from God we really are. We are dwelling on something that is written in deep symbolisms and taking it literally. Belowwe will discuss the Moses and Kundalini symbology behind the scripture.</p>

<p>Exodus 4 : 2 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod.</p>

<p>Rod becomes serpent</p>

<p>Rod = spine = physical aspect of our nature, our EGO. It is our authority and our foundation.  When we put this down and relinquish control of the lower self the kundalini will activate within us becoming the serpent.</p>

<p>The spiritual force will awaken within us when we sit in meditation and relinquish control of our physical foundation as being our identity and reason for existence.</p>

<p>Exodus 4: 4 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:</p>

<p>Hand taken by the tail = point of origin of the kundalini starts with the coccyx at the tailbone. When we throw it down it will become spirit and spiritualize our physical. We still have the physical it does not disappear and we can take back that authority whenever we like only we will see it in a totally different perspective as a result of the insights in our meditation.</p>

<p>The kundalini rises up to consume all of the fear, hate and guilt within us.</p>

<p>Hindu: when the flute is on the lips of God the serpent will rise:</p>

<p>Exodus 4:  6 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.</p>

<p>Hand was like snow (white) =the hand always means energy, the left hand is energy that comes in, the right hand is energy that goes out. So when we place our physical energy inside of our self (our bosom) it becomes white = free of all the stains of thoughts, fear and guilt etc. It becomes as pure as snow.</p>

<p>Exodus 4 : 7 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.</p>

<p>Putting hand in again and it was turned as his other flesh = the same as taking control of the serpent.</p>

<p>Exodus 4: 8 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.</p>

<p>If they wont believe you after you have had these spiritual realisations they never will.</p>

<p>Exodus 4: 9 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.</p>

<p>Water on dry ground turning into blood.</p>

<p>Blood symbolically is the same as the fourth stage of consciousness which is fire.</p>

<p>Here we have taken our lower mind (dry ground) and gone into the water which is the second stage of consciousness, we have risen up in the air to the third stage which is no thought.</p>

<p>Water turning into blood means the truth is becoming a spiritual power within you and this comes across in our teaching of others. So when we are talking about the spiritual path to others they may not on the surface be in agreement with us but something deep within them knows that we are talking with authority. We give them the unfolding flower of truth that knows nothing of wars or violence, but is the source of all creation and is nothing but UNIVERSAL LOVE.</p>

<p>Most people have not the slightest idea about why they are alive and what the purpose of that life is.</p>

<p>The above verse is describing a demonstration of spiritual knowledge within us when speaking to others and we will touch people spiritually in many ways whether they recognise it or not.</p>

<p>Buddha says the earth has been made into a hell by the negative vibrations of many people in the world because they are not one with themselves or nature.</p>

<p>All we generally know about ourselves is what we have been told by others, e.g. our parents, schools, employers, religious institutions, government and none of these know either. So we have the ‘wounded child’ within which represents our spirit and this is all God wants; for this child to grow so that we may become enlightened and know ourselves.</p>

<p>To recap we are in the book of Exodus and the movement out of Egypt across the Red Sea to the Promised Land, a journey inside of us.</p>

<p>Exodus 4: 10 And Moses said unto the LORD, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.</p>

<p>Moses says that he is not eloquent enough to teach maybe others can but not him. But the whole purpose of this encounter with God is to say YES you can teach because there is a part in you called Aaron – Moses brother.</p>

<p>Aaron = the part of us that God will allow to grow in us despite our lack of faith in our selves (if we have been beaten down in confidence). It will take us to Pharaoh and it will allow us to confront the pharaoh (our ego) and say let me go I don’t want this anymore and upon enlightenment we explode with light, love and understanding of what our lifes purpose and human existence is all about. We will then know true PEACE within.</p>

<p>Many of us have been so traumatised in our life that we have lost all confidence in our spiritual path and ability to follow it.</p>

<p>God says Come to the mountain and ill send everything necessary to you as ill show you that part in you that is untouched by all of these things (Aaron) who will confront your ego (Pharaoh)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is from a book, God-Man: The word made flesh.
Another great read.</p>

<p>THE ANTI-CHRIST
PRIMITIVE Christians, the Essenes, fully realized and taught the great truth that Christ was a substance, an oil or ointment contained especially in the Spinal Cord, consequently in all parts of the body, as every nerve in the body is directly or indirectly connected with the wonderful &quot;River that flows out of Eden (the
upper brain) to water the garden.&quot; The early Christians knew that the Scriptures, whether
written in ancient Hebrew or the Greek, were allegories, parables or fables based on the human body, &quot;fearfully and wonderfully made.&quot;
These adepts knew that the secretion (gray matter creative) which issues (secretes), from the cerebrum, was the source and cause of the physical expression called man; and they knew that the &quot;River of Jordan&quot; was symbolized in the spinal cord and that the &quot;Dead Sea&quot; was used to symbolize the Sacred Plexus at the base of
the spinal column where the Jordan (spinal cord) ends, typifying the entrance of Jordan into the Dead Sea.
 The thick, oily and salty substance composing the Sacral Plexus, Cauda Equina&quot; (tail of the horse), may be likened unto crude Petroleum (Petra, mineral, or salt, and oleum-Latin for oil) and the thinner substance, oil Plexus,  or ointment in the spinal cord, may be compared with coal oil; and when this oil is carried up and crosses the Ida and Pingala (two fluid nerves that end in a cross in medulla oblongata where it contacts the cerebellum (Golgotha, the place of the skull) this fluid is refined, as coal oil is refined, to produce gasoline a - higher rate of motion that causes the ascension of the airship.</p>

<p>When the oil (ointment) is crucified-(to crucify
means to increase in power a thousand fold --not to kill) it remains two days and a half. (the moon&#39;s period in sign) in the tomb (cerebellum) and on the third day ascends to the Pineal Gland that connects the cerebellum with the Optic Thalmus, the Central Eye in the Throne of God that is the chamber overtopped by the hollow
(hallowed) caused by the curve of the cerebrum (the Most High&quot; of the body) which is the &quot;Temple of the Living God,&quot; the living, vital substance which is a precipitation of the &quot;Breath of Life&quot; breathed into man - therefore, the &quot;Holy (whole) Ghost&quot; or breath.</p>

<p>The Pineal Gland is the &quot;Pinnacle of the Temple.&quot; The modus operandi by which the oil of the spinal cord reaches the Pineal Gland is described in what follows.
   &quot;There is no name under Heaven whereby ye may be saved except Jesus Christed and then crucified&quot; (correct rendering of the Greek text).
   Every twenty-nine and one-half days, when the moon is in the sign of the zodiac that the sun was in at the birth of the native, there is a seed, or Psycho-Physical germ born in the, or out of, the Solar Plexus (the Manger) and this seed is taken up by the nerves or branches of the
Pneumo gastric nerve, and becomes the &quot;Fruit of the Tree of Life, or the &quot;Tree of good and evil&quot; -viz.: good, if saved and &quot;cast upon the waters&quot; (circulation) to reach the Pineal Gland; and evil, if eaten or consumed in sexual expression on the physical plane, or by alcoholic drinks, or gluttony that causes ferment - acid and even alcohol in intestinal tract-thus-&quot;No drunkard can inherit the Kingdom of Heaven&quot; for acids and alcohol cut, or chemically split, the oil that unites with the mineral salts in the body and thus produces the monthly seed.</p>

<pre><code>This seed, having the odor of fish, was called Jesus, from Ichtos (Greek for fish) and Nun (Hebrew for of life;&quot; - thus &quot;Joshua the son of Nun,&quot; - &quot;I am the bread that came down from heaven; &quot;Give us this day our daily bread.&quot;
 The fruit of the Tree of Life, therefore, is the &quot;Fish bread&quot; of which thou shalt not eat on the plane or animal or Adam (earth-dust of the earth plane) but to &quot;Him that overcometh will I give to eat of the fruit of the Tree of Life,&quot; because he saved it and it returned to him in the cerebellum, the home of the Spiritual man, the Ego.
</code></pre>

<p>The cerebellum is heart-shaped and called the heart in Greek—thus &quot;As a man thinketh in his heart so is he.&quot;</p>

<pre><code>The bodily organ that men in their ignorance call heart is termed divider or pump in Greek and Hebrew. Our blood divider is not the button that we touch when we think, but it is the upper lobe of cerebellum that vibrates thought. The lower lobe is the animal (mortal) lobe that
</code></pre>

<p>governs the animal world—that section of the body below the Solar Plexus, called lower Egypt--natural body kingdom of earth-Appollyon--the Devil (lived, spelled
backward) Satan (Saturn governs the bowels), etc. 
    Fire and Brimstone (the lake of fire) comes from the fact that sulphur (brimstone) is the prime factor in generating the rate of motion called heat, and overeating develops a surplus of sulphur. 
    ‎During the first 300 years of the Christian era all that has been above written was understood by the real Christians, and about the end of that time the persecution of these Essenes by the priesthood became so marked that they met in secret and always made the sign of the fish.<br/>
    ‎About the year 325, Constantine, the pagan Roman Emperor, called the teachers of Christianity together at Nicea.
    Constantine murdered his mother and boiled his wife in oil because they still held to the original doctrines of the Essenes. Constantine was told by the priests of his time that there was no forgiveness for crimes such as his, except through a long series of incarnations; but the anti-Christ sought to concoct a plan by which he hoped to cheat the Cosmic law.
    ‎ And so it came to pass, after months of wrangling and fighting over the writings of the primitive Christians who clothed the wonders of the human body in oriental imagery, that the council, sometimes by a bare majority vote, decided which of the manuscripts were the &quot;Word of God&quot; and which were not.
    ‎The very important point in the minds of those ignorant priests - whether or not an angel had wings - was decided in favor of wings by three majority. The minority contended that, as Jacob let down the ladder for angels to descend and ascend upon it was a prima facie evidence that angels do not have wings.
    ‎
    ‎ Just think, for a moment, upon the colossal ignorance of these priests who did not know that Jacob in Hebrew means &quot;heel catcher&quot; or circle, and that ladder refer to the influence of the signs of the zodiac upon the earth; and as one sign rising every two hours forms a circle
every twenty-four hours (the four and twenty Elders of Revelation) the outer stars of the rising suns (sons) &quot;catching on&quot; to the last sons (suns) of the sign ascending,
     But now we come to the anti-Christ
     The council of Nicea, dominated by Constantine, voted that the symbols of the human body were persons; that Jesus was a certain historical man, a contention utterly and indubitably without foundation, in fact, and
that all who believed (?) the story would be saved and forgiven here and now. The idea appealed to Constantine as an easy way out of his troubled mind and so the scheme of salvation by the actual blood of a real man or god was engrafted in the world. 
    Constantine and his dupes saw that the only way to perpetuate the infamy was to keep the world in ignorance of the operation of the Cosmic Law, so they changed &quot;Times and Seasons&quot;
      The date that they made the sun enter Aries was March 21st. Why? March 21st should be the first day of Aries, the head; April 19th should be the first day of Taurus, the neck, and so on through the twelve signs; but these designing schemers knew that by thus suppressing the truth the people might not come to realize what was meant by &quot;The heavens declare the glory of God&quot;. Again: the moon, in its monthly round of 29 1/2 days enters the outer stars (or suns) of a constellation two and one-half days before it enters the central suns constellations that are known as the Signs of Zodiac or the &quot;Circle of Beasts.&quot; But even unto this day whole the whole anti-Christ world (so-called &quot;Christian&quot;) except
the astrologers, go by almanacs that make the moon enter a sign of the zodiac two and one-half days before it does enter it and thus perpetuate the lie of the pagan Constantine, the anti-Christ.</p>

<pre><code>For more evidence that Jesus and Christ are in your flesh see 1st Epistle of John - 4th Chapter, 2nd and 3rd verses.
‎The Greek and Hebrew texts of our Scriptures plainly teach that Jesus and Christ, John and baptism, crucifixion and ascension, the triumph of the Ego over the &quot;Enemy death&quot;  are in the substance and potentialities of the body; and that these fluids can and will save the physical body, if conserved and not consumed ( or wasted ) in sexual or animal desire. 
‎All of whatever name religious denomination who teach contrary doctrine afree with Constantine who appeared in the &quot;Latter days&quot; of the pure Christian Practice.
‎Who is the anti-Christ? Look at a world of ruins. Does a good tree bring forth evil fruit?
‎The so-called teachers of, and believers in Christianity believe as Constantine and his priests, that the Christ is &quot;out in the desert&quot; of the Judean hills- out on Calvary. Do they ever look for the meaning of Calvary in Greek? Calvary means a skull, and Golgotha - the place of the skull, exactly where the seed is crucified.
‎One-half of the combatants in the world&#39;s Armageddon have been praying , as Constantine prayed, &quot;for God&#39;s help for Christ&#39;s sake&quot;. The other half pray to the same imaginary God and Christ out in &quot;The desert&quot; of their own ignorance for &quot;peace and victory.&quot;
‎Return and come unto the God and Christ within you, oh! Ye deluded ones, and the bugles will all sing truce along the iron front of war and the &quot;Ransomed of the Lord will return to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their faces.&quot;

Another great read.</p>

<p>THE ANTI-CHRIST
PRIMITIVE Christians, the Essenes, fully realized and taught the great truth that Christ was a substance, an oil or ointment contained especially in the Spinal Cord, consequently in all parts of the body, as every nerve in the body is directly or indirectly connected with the wonderful &quot;River that flows out of Eden (the
upper brain) to water the garden.&quot; The early Christians knew that the Scriptures, whether
written in ancient Hebrew or the Greek, were allegories, parables or fables based on the human body, &quot;fearfully and wonderfully made.&quot;
These adepts knew that the secretion (gray matter creative) which issues (secretes), from the cerebrum, was the source and cause of the physical expression called man; and they knew that the &quot;River of Jordan&quot; was symbolized in the spinal cord and that the &quot;Dead Sea&quot; was used to symbolize the Sacred Plexus at the base of
the spinal column where the Jordan (spinal cord) ends, typifying the entrance of Jordan into the Dead Sea.
 The thick, oily and salty substance composing the Sacral Plexus, Cauda Equina&quot; (tail of the horse), may be likened unto crude Petroleum (Petra, mineral, or salt, and oleum-Latin for oil) and the thinner substance, oil Plexus,  or ointment in the spinal cord, may be compared with coal oil; and when this oil is carried up and crosses the Ida and Pingala (two fluid nerves that end in a cross in medulla oblongata where it contacts the cerebellum (Golgotha, the place of the skull) this fluid is refined, as coal oil is refined, to produce gasoline a - higher rate of motion that causes the ascension of the airship.</p>

<p>When the oil (ointment) is crucified-(to crucify
means to increase in power a thousand fold --not to kill) it remains two days and a half. (the moon&#39;s period in sign) in the tomb (cerebellum) and on the third day ascends to the Pineal Gland that connects the cerebellum with the Optic Thalmus, the Central Eye in the Throne of God that is the chamber overtopped by the hollow
(hallowed) caused by the curve of the cerebrum (the Most High&quot; of the body) which is the &quot;Temple of the Living God,&quot; the living, vital substance which is a precipitation of the &quot;Breath of Life&quot; breathed into man - therefore, the &quot;Holy (whole) Ghost&quot; or breath.</p>

<p>The Pineal Gland is the &quot;Pinnacle of the Temple.&quot; The modus operandi by which the oil of the spinal cord reaches the Pineal Gland is described in what follows.
   &quot;There is no name under Heaven whereby ye may be saved except Jesus Christed and then crucified&quot; (correct rendering of the Greek text).
   Every twenty-nine and one-half days, when the moon is in the sign of the zodiac that the sun was in at the birth of the native, there is a seed, or Psycho-Physical germ born in the, or out of, the Solar Plexus (the Manger) and this seed is taken up by the nerves or branches of the
Pneumo gastric nerve, and becomes the &quot;Fruit of the Tree of Life, or the &quot;Tree of good and evil&quot; -viz.: good, if saved and &quot;cast upon the waters&quot; (circulation) to reach the Pineal Gland; and evil, if eaten or consumed in sexual expression on the physical plane, or by alcoholic drinks, or gluttony that causes ferment - acid and even alcohol in intestinal tract-thus-&quot;No drunkard can inherit the Kingdom of Heaven&quot; for acids and alcohol cut, or chemically split, the oil that unites with the mineral salts in the body and thus produces the monthly seed.</p>

<pre><code>This seed, having the odor of fish, was called Jesus, from Ichtos (Greek for fish) and Nun (Hebrew for of life;&quot; - thus &quot;Joshua the son of Nun,&quot; - &quot;I am the bread that came down from heaven; &quot;Give us this day our daily bread.&quot;
 The fruit of the Tree of Life, therefore, is the &quot;Fish bread&quot; of which thou shalt not eat on the plane or animal or Adam (earth-dust of the earth plane) but to &quot;Him that overcometh will I give to eat of the fruit of the Tree of Life,&quot; because he saved it and it returned to him in the cerebellum, the home of the Spiritual man, the Ego.
</code></pre>

<p>The cerebellum is heart-shaped and called the heart in Greek—thus &quot;As a man thinketh in his heart so is he.&quot;</p>

<pre><code>The bodily organ that men in their ignorance call heart is termed divider or pump in Greek and Hebrew. Our blood divider is not the button that we touch when we think, but it is the upper lobe of cerebellum that vibrates thought. The lower lobe is the animal (mortal) lobe that
</code></pre>

<p>governs the animal world—that section of the body below the Solar Plexus, called lower Egypt--natural body kingdom of earth-Appollyon--the Devil (lived, spelled
backward) Satan (Saturn governs the bowels), etc. 
    Fire and Brimstone (the lake of fire) comes from the fact that sulphur (brimstone) is the prime factor in generating the rate of motion called heat, and overeating develops a surplus of sulphur. 
    ‎During the first 300 years of the Christian era all that has been above written was understood by the real Christians, and about the end of that time the persecution of these Essenes by the priesthood became so marked that they met in secret and always made the sign of the fish.<br/>
    ‎About the year 325, Constantine, the pagan Roman Emperor, called the teachers of Christianity together at Nicea.
    Constantine murdered his mother and boiled his wife in oil because they still held to the original doctrines of the Essenes. Constantine was told by the priests of his time that there was no forgiveness for crimes such as his, except through a long series of incarnations; but the anti-Christ sought to concoct a plan by which he hoped to cheat the Cosmic law.
    ‎ And so it came to pass, after months of wrangling and fighting over the writings of the primitive Christians who clothed the wonders of the human body in oriental imagery, that the council, sometimes by a bare majority vote, decided which of the manuscripts were the &quot;Word of God&quot; and which were not.
    ‎The very important point in the minds of those ignorant priests - whether or not an angel had wings - was decided in favor of wings by three majority. The minority contended that, as Jacob let down the ladder for angels to descend and ascend upon it was a prima facie evidence that angels do not have wings.
    ‎
    ‎ Just think, for a moment, upon the colossal ignorance of these priests who did not know that Jacob in Hebrew means &quot;heel catcher&quot; or circle, and that ladder refer to the influence of the signs of the zodiac upon the earth; and as one sign rising every two hours forms a circle
every twenty-four hours (the four and twenty Elders of Revelation) the outer stars of the rising suns (sons) &quot;catching on&quot; to the last sons (suns) of the sign ascending,
     But now we come to the anti-Christ
     The council of Nicea, dominated by Constantine, voted that the symbols of the human body were persons; that Jesus was a certain historical man, a contention utterly and indubitably without foundation, in fact, and
that all who believed (?) the story would be saved and forgiven here and now. The idea appealed to Constantine as an easy way out of his troubled mind and so the scheme of salvation by the actual blood of a real man or god was engrafted in the world. 
    Constantine and his dupes saw that the only way to perpetuate the infamy was to keep the world in ignorance of the operation of the Cosmic Law, so they changed &quot;Times and Seasons&quot;
      The date that they made the sun enter Aries was March 21st. Why? March 21st should be the first day of Aries, the head; April 19th should be the first day of Taurus, the neck, and so on through the twelve signs; but these designing schemers knew that by thus suppressing the truth the people might not come to realize what was meant by &quot;The heavens declare the glory of God&quot;. Again: the moon, in its monthly round of 29 1/2 days enters the outer stars (or suns) of a constellation two and one-half days before it enters the central suns constellations that are known as the Signs of Zodiac or the &quot;Circle of Beasts.&quot; But even unto this day whole the whole anti-Christ world (so-called &quot;Christian&quot;) except
the astrologers, go by almanacs that make the moon enter a sign of the zodiac two and one-half days before it does enter it and thus perpetuate the lie of the pagan Constantine, the anti-Christ.</p>

<pre><code>For more evidence that Jesus and Christ are in your flesh see 1st Epistle of John - 4th Chapter, 2nd and 3rd verses.
‎The Greek and Hebrew texts of our Scriptures plainly teach that Jesus and Christ, John and baptism, crucifixion and ascension, the triumph of the Ego over the &quot;Enemy death&quot;  are in the substance and potentialities of the body; and that these fluids can and will save the physical body, if conserved and not consumed ( or wasted ) in sexual or animal desire. 
‎All of whatever name religious denomination who teach contrary doctrine afree with Constantine who appeared in the &quot;Latter days&quot; of the pure Christian Practice.
‎Who is the anti-Christ? Look at a world of ruins. Does a good tree bring forth evil fruit?
‎The so-called teachers of, and believers in Christianity believe as Constantine and his priests, that the Christ is &quot;out in the desert&quot; of the Judean hills- out on Calvary. Do they ever look for the meaning of Calvary in Greek? Calvary means a skull, and Golgotha - the place of the skull, exactly where the seed is crucified.
‎One-half of the combatants in the world&#39;s Armageddon have been praying , as Constantine prayed, &quot;for God&#39;s help for Christ&#39;s sake&quot;. The other half pray to the same imaginary God and Christ out in &quot;The desert&quot; of their own ignorance for &quot;peace and victory.&quot;
‎Return and come unto the God and Christ within you, oh! Ye deluded ones, and the bugles will all sing truce along the iron front of war and the &quot;Ransomed of the Lord will return to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their faces.&quot;
