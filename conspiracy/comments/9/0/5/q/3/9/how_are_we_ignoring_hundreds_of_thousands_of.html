        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We say there is no evidence of vaccines causing any harm to children, that there are no links to vaccines and autism, that the rates of a reaction are 1 in a million.  How can this be the case when there are hundreds of thousands of parents who are saying the opposite, that they witnessed their friend, child or themselves having a vaccine reaction, that they reported within a short period of time after vaccinating their child regressed into autism, died of sids or had seizures only to be told by their doctors it was a &quot;coincidence&quot;.  </p>

<p>Whether vaccines work or not is entirely a different question but how can we actively say vaccines are absolutely safe and there is no evidence, yet so many people of varied backgrounds: mothers, fathers, doctors, government officials, teachers, high income, low income, are coming forward saying the same thing.  These people are being called liars and that they don&#39;t understand science, yet they saw something completely different with their own eyes.  If it were only a few people saying this it could be more easily brushed off but with how many people have come forward with this same claim it seems ignorant of the truth because these people are showing you a reality you refuse to look at.  </p>

<p>Can you honestly label every single one of these people as a &quot;liar&quot; or that they don&#39;t understand &quot;science&quot;.  How can we possibly have so many reports from so many parents saying the same thing without there being any correlation and writing it off as coincidence.  </p>

People start getting vaccinated so young, I don&#39;t know how you would determine that your kid, if left vaccine free, wouldn&#39;t have been autistic anyway. Im not trying to take a definitive stance on whether or not vaccines can cause autism here, its not something I&#39;ve looked into much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What these parents are saying isn&#39;t that their child just develops autism, they say that their child which is perfectly normal and healthy, shows no signs of autism (speaking, making eye contact, etc) suddenly regresses into autism immediately following a vaccination which is why it feels too coincidental.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I&#39;m hesitant to blame the vaccine solely for that regression without reading more about autism in general, I don&#39;t really know much about how autism presents itself or progresses. There also don&#39;t seem to be many control cases of unvaccinated autism, that could be evidence for vaccine linked autism but could also just be a lack of data, all the sites I&#39;m seeing on the topic seem less that unbiased.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly for many it’s not so much  the autism link wether real or alleged. Many parents have taken the time to research the ingredients of many of the vaccines and they are truly horrifying. Couple that with the fact that oversight sight has been terribly lacking on the companies and labs that produce these vaccines and these people who choose not to vaccinate their children shouldn’t look too lunatic fringe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not <em>just</em> the vaccines though.  There is loads of evidence pointing to organophospate pesticides and herbicides, as well as the harmful nature of most of the vegetation we eat.</p>

<p>I started a carnivore diet a few weeks back and the more and more I read on it, the more I&#39;m convinced that an animal only diet would help many, if not most, who suffer with autism.</p>

<p>The food pyramid was made during war time, when our govt. scientists had to figure out how to get all the micro and macro nutrients from less than ideal foods.  The standard American diet (SAD) is terrible and full of inflammatory foods that fuck up the gut biome.  And each day we understand more and more about how the gut biome affects the brain.  Head over to <a href="/r/zerocarb">/r/zerocarb</a> and read through and you&#39;ll start to get the feeling that we&#39;re intentionally misled about diet in order to keep us dumb, slow, and in need of medicine for chronic issues that could be corrected by diet.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not just talking out my ass here, either.  A friend of mine is a research biologist studying fungicides and has found that those are endocrine disruptors as well (which was not the focus of his study - he is studying how they actually work, since we don&#39;t know).  The evidence is mounting against Monstanto/Bayer, and they&#39;re already working with a stacked deck to defend themselves.  Only when there is a critical mass of people willing to experiment with their health and are able to show objectively measurable results will the scales tip.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here’s the biggest thing with diet and autism. Lots of autistic people/children only eat certain foods. Case in point: our 3 year old recently diagnosed on the spectrum literally will only eat a few different foods. I’ve researched diet and if I could somehow get him to try different foods this is something I’d be all over if I thought changing his diet would help. But, when they are repulsed by even the sight smell or texture of certain (most) foods how does one even go about it? 
Do I think vaccines cause autism; a year ago I’d have said no. Now, looking back I question it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Will your child eat any meat?  Specifically, beef?  If so, you might consider doing a 30 day trial on just meat and water to see if it helps.  The working theory is it&#39;s the carbs that mess up the gut, which affects the brain.  Consider an elimination diet of some kind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He won’t eat any beef or dairy of any kind. He refuses and/or gags. I’ve given up for the time being. He’s also nonverbal so lack of communication doesn’t help with trying to coax any food into him or guess at what he is asking for in the first place. We’ve tried to cut out what few carbs he does eat but when he doesn’t eat much to start with it’s kind of hard to limit his already tiny food selection. </p>

<p>A close friend of mine is a research scientist studying fungicides (round-up) and the goal of his research was to find out exactly why it works.  What his team found shook him to the core, to the point that he shared his early work with us in case something happens to him.  His results show links to autism, parkinson&#39;s, and alzheimer&#39;s.  The FDA just released info that almost all food tested contains traces of round-up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, ya. I&#39;m a microbiologist. I have been trying to mechanically separate spores from the legionella samples, but the pic is the result of that attempt. I just got a new PCR instrument, but like all things it seems, it solves 1 problem and causes 2 more.</p>

<p>Now i&#39;m thinking just some kind of nature friendly fungicide or something. Normally this isn&#39;t a problem, you don&#39;t find legionella very often. The test is generally just to prove it <em>isn&#39;t</em> there for compliance reasons. But this location is hot af. Pretty fun, work is usually pretty mundane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His reply &quot;It&#39;s kind of a tall order. Fungi are pretty tough. normally when one cleans up bacterial cultures its by doing a single colony isolation. You can also use certain aperture filters because fungi are so much bigger than bacteria to filter the medium</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said vaccines aren&#39;t effective and you can find the source from cdc in money paid out by thr program.  What this post was meant to highlight that we have numerous parents saying they have a child that was vaccine injured, that they witnessed the effects and we are calling them liars and victim shaming them for being skeptical about vaccinating their next child.  Also these are only the successful cases, if you have a pre existing condition like asthma or take medications you are not qualified for compensation from this program</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your pediatrician is not the bad guy, most doctors want whats best for their patient and I believe they are simply being misled and fed false information.  The problem I am talking about is the people who are making millions of dollars on the use of vaccines are the same people who are responsible for oversight of the safety studies that take place, the people who vote on passing vaccines at acip meetings have patents for vaccines, the cdc has been stated to have bias and conflict of interest.  These groups have reason to hide evidence and ignore science because billions of dollars are being made, what is being asked is a 3rd party that over sees these groups to ensure nobody can give out false data.  Look at Poul Thornsen, he stole millions of dollars from research funds for vaccine autism studies, we never verified if his studies were accurate, we are literally trusting a wanted criminal with the safety of our children.</p>

It appears these deceptive measures are already being practiced in most countries since adverse reactions continue to be “rare” while incidence in the populations keeps increasing proportionally to vaccine use. </p>

<p>”Under WHO&#39;s revised manual on AEFI (Adverse Events Following Immunization), only those adverse reactions observed during clinical trials of a vaccine, should be classified as vaccine related.  <em>All new serious adverse reactions including deaths seen during post-marketing of the vaccine should be considered as &#39;coincidental&#39; or &#39;unclassifiable&#39;, and the vaccine should not be blamed.”</em></p>

<p>”The WHO has also changed the <em>definition of &quot;causal association,&quot;</em> the doctors say. Under the revised guidelines, <em>if there is an alternate explanation for the adverse event, or another factor is involved, causative association with vaccine should not be made</em>. &quot;In other words, if after vaccination, a child with an underlying congenital heart disease develops cardiac failure, it would not be considered causally related to the vaccine.&quot;”</p>

<p>”The revised classification by WHO &quot;is a major step backward for patient safety,&quot; the authors say, adding, &quot;This could embolden vaccine manufacturers to be more reckless with regard to adverse reactions.&quot;.”</p>
