        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>536 people have been to space, and there are 7.442 billion people on Earth. That&#39;s less than 1% of the population that has been to space. Very easy to keep a secret, and meanwhile we have these &#39;educated&#39; people reading books and getting a degree in these fields acting superior from knowledge which was written by freemasons. Anybody here that is not born in the last 100 years? No. Our parents went through the same manipulation and then it was handed it to us. Whether space exists, or whether they’re trying to depopulate, it’s a conspiracy and some people should take note of it. 1500 german&#39;s/nazi&#39;s came to the U.S to work in the CIA, NASA, etc right after the Holocaust, you can obviously see how they&#39;ve infiltrated these corporations and manipulated the media.</p>

<p>Why does NASA get funded billions of dollars to go up there? More than 1.3 billion people live in extreme poverty, 22 000 children die each day due to poverty. What’s so important about going up there that we can’t even work together as a species and help each other grow and/or live in peace and harmony.</p>

<p>If you go to NASA&#39;s website you won’t be able to find one full sized photo of the Earth (that’s recent ;). The last photo they revealed was 3 years ago. And before that it was 43 years ago. Maybe the Earth doesn’t look so good because of what they’ve been doing to it, such as pollution and weather control.</p>

<p>Because of all these lies we’ve been told, the Earth may be a lot larger. Keep them busy working all week, fluoride in the waters to suppress brain activity, that way we won’t have critical thinkers destroying the Earth prison we’ve created and lose power and control. That’s probably what they said early before the wars were pre-meditated.</p>

<p>MAYBE we would have ZERO flat-earthers if there was ZERO evidence of flat earth. If you wanna get personal, I don’t have any belief about the Earth, I just dislike pathetic liars. I’m sick of this pollution, them-trails, poisoned foods, manipulation and indoctrination. But I am happy to see a lot of people waking up now, to see just how scared these people/reptilians actually are, some even just be on here all day manipulating as a side job.</p>

<p>In what year would Earth be at Type 2 or 3 on the Kardashev Scale? Well at the rate things are going now, probably never. Maybe when the wars end and peace and love is all that exists, and the education system is ready to help, then there might be a chance. But in my opinion I&#39;m ashamed to be apart of the human society, conceited and egotistic people everywhere, yet we label the open minded creative geniuses. Take a look at history if you don&#39;t believe me.</p>

<p>What would you do if you found out there was no Universe and the Earth is all there is, and that there are different creatures and more land beyond Antarctica. &quot;Admiral Byrd&#39;s two flights over both Poles prove that there is a `strangeness&#39; about the shape of the Earth in both polar areas. Byrd flew to the North Pole, but did not stop there and turn back, but went for 1, 700 miles beyond it, and then retraced his course to his Arctic base (due to his gasoline supply running low). As progress was made beyond the Pole point, iceless land and lakes, mountains covered with trees, and even a monstrous animal, resembling the mammoth of antiquity, was seen moving through the underbrush; and all this was reported via radio by the plane occupants. For almost all of the 1,700 miles, the plane flew over land, mountains, trees, lakes and rivers. </p>

<p>Again, what’s so important about going up there that we can’t even work together as a species and help each other grow and/or live in peace and harmony. Wish everyone peace and love, especially the evil ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excuse me. Let me be more clear, since you’re obviously having a hard time grasping this; </p>

<p>A photo is an image created by light passing through a lens, which is then transferred to a viewable image via film or computer software.</p>

<p>A computer generated image is a digital image created from scratch using a photo editing or rendering software.</p>

<p>How can you prove that what you see on that .gov site is <em>actually</em> a photograph? Or are you just taking someone’s word for it?</p>

<p>You know you can download weather data directly from satellites don&#39;t you?  You can also see, via the Doppler shift, that GPS satellites are moving very quickly, way to fast for them to exist in the Earth&#39;s atmosphere.</p>

<p>That isn&#39;t called for.  Since FE doesn&#39;t have a model everyone kind of does their own thing so I asked questions instead of assuming.  You might want to look into doing that yourself.</p>

They don&#39;t really. I mean, they do get like $18b but that money isn&#39;t entirely for sending people to space. NASA does a lot more than spend people to space. </p>

<p>Are you saying NASA hasn&#39;t released a full-size photo of earth because it doesn&#39;t look good? Then why the fuck would they release one three years ago? Why release one at all? They have hundreds of photos of earth up close and from far away. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>MAYBE we would have ZERO flat-earthers if there was ZERO evidence of flat earth.
This doesn&#39;t make sense. There is zero evidence of a flat earth, to begin with. Not to mention the fact that just because a person or group of people believe in something, doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s real evidence to validate them. </p>

<p>Again, what’s so important about going up there that we can’t even work together as a species and help each other grow and/or live in peace and harmony.
I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re getting at. NASA doesn&#39;t operate as an organization to bring about world peace. Just because they take their funding doesn&#39;t mean that funding is withheld from other aspects of society. Our government doesn&#39;t lift people out of poverty and end all its wars because there&#39;s not enough money to, it&#39;s because there&#39;s profit in keeping it going. NASA and the realm of science and technology isn&#39;t the reason we&#39;re not in peace and harmony. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit, this is awesome. You actually sent me proof that I was correct. From the article you linked:
&quot;The new cameras will soon start sending down data regularly, which will allow it to send a new picture of the Earth every day, which is set to start in September 2015. That will let Nasa study the Earth’s daily changes, and the agency will make them available to the public on a special page, 12 to 36 hours after they are taken.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/?date=2018-03-08">Here&#39;s the website.</a> They don&#39;t actually have every day, but it does go back to June 13, 2015. Pretty neat.</p>

<p>Looks like it&#39;s got at least an average of 2 weeks worth of new pictures since then, meaning we&#39;ve had <em>at least</em> 365 <strong>new</strong> pictures of the <strong>whole</strong> earth in just the past 3 years (just in case you can&#39;t do the research yourself).</p>

<p>I genuinely think their problem is federal interference. They get $18b a year, yet haven&#39;t attempted much space-wise. All that money is going towards <em>something.</em> Is it because the government doesn&#39;t care or because we can&#39;t or is it a calculated effort for something else?</p>

<p>I don’t believe we have been more than 250 miles from the earth and even the space station has holes in it. Some of those TV interviews are just fake there is little doubt of that. Though does that mean it’s not there ?  No, but I don’t see the point of it flying about out there just to televise some silly experiments. I’ve seen something in the sky go by that’s for sure. </p>

<p>Something doesn’t smell right about the whole thing. We now live in a time where anything can be easily faked. And it’s hard to tell the difference. The film Gravity is a perfect example of that. Some Think there is an advanced space programme, it’s possible. </p>

<p>But your use of the word &#39;alt-left,&#39; your belief that my thinking is &quot;terrifying,&quot; and your cool dismissal of anything that doesn&#39;t reflect your viewpoints tells me plenty about what you think &quot;conspiracy&quot; means.

<p>Oh man, your entire post is just complete bull shit, top to bottom.

<p>I love that the concept of a fact checker, first,only makes you think of snopes, but second--that the concept of a fact-checker at all is a joke to you! Because fuck facts, right? Conspiracies are figured out by sleuths with fucking YouTube accounts!! Fact checkers are for the birds, right? And YouTube is totally trying to shut you down because you know the #truth!!</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t use the word &quot;evil,&quot; you did. And forgive me, I used the word conservative, when right wing makes more sense, I&#39;m sure, and a little more on the nose.</p>

<p>What projection was made? I know that word is so much fun to throw around now that everyone&#39;s made it into complete nonsense, but it doesn&#39;t apply here. But whether you like it or not, you are part of the new right wing movement, the meme and the factless and the feckless generation that doesn&#39;t get pinned down into an ideology, and burns everything down at random. I&#39;m sure that sounds like such a <em>cool</em> group to be apart of because &quot;everything is a lie!&quot; but you should know what you&#39;re doing. </p>
