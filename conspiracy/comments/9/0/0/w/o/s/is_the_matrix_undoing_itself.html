In its insatiable need for control this Matrix has become significantly overloaded. <strong>Glitches</strong> and <strong>Rendering Errors</strong> are being seen by many who are awakening.

Eventually some will evolve to <strong>Override</strong> and ultimately <strong>Control The Simulation</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Synchonicity is basically finding a common thread between two seemingly random events, like meaningful coincidences.</p>

<p>I notice it most when I&#39;m with my wife. We&#39;ll be in each other&#39;s company and without any prior mention of anything, I will think of something and within a few minutes she&#39;ll think of the same thing, say it, then we&#39;ll both look at each other and say something like, &quot;I was just thinking that exact thought, how did you know?&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had this happen with other people too, as well as things like commercials and ads. Usually it&#39;ll be about what I was just thinking of a while before the synchronicity happens, and then something will say what I was thinking. </p>

<p>Is it confirmation bias? Maybe. Synchronicities? Maybe, I don&#39;t know for sure, but meaningful coincidences fits the bill pretty well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know I just looked it up myself within the hour!  Weird that you just responded.</p>

<p>Reason I looked it up just now is because I run a small campsite on my property and the other day while on a horse across the river I saw surveyors on my land.  Now I am in the country and thats just not something that is done.  Its my land.  But long story short couldnt get across fast enough to find out who it was.  Long story short it was th USGA doing it.  Still not cool, but not as big a deal.  </p>

<p>Today I google one of the campers coming this weekend, and its a woman that works for the USGA.  Weird?  Kinda right?</p>

<p>She has a Russian name also.  If that adds anything to this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea certainly a bit strange, but I&#39;d call that a synchronicity. I haven&#39;t been paying as much attention to mine, but I know if you start looking for them you&#39;ll encounter them more often. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That word awake, awakened is something that should be carefully scrutinized, since there are feelings attached to those words, that are made to evoke certain feelings and thoughts.  &#39; That person is so &#39;woke.&#39; &#39;Our movement is awake!&quot;.  We tend to like words that evoke feelings in us, and stand by feelings, instead of rational. Many news stations, government understand this psychology, and shamelessly use wording like this to manipulate emotions in people. If I say collusion, what thoughts, feelings come to mind, what if I say terrorists, immigrants. Many of those words have been breed to evoke strong emotions in us. An emotional being, is easier to control, than one who isn&#39;t controlled by words, which have basically become spells.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you feel you are using a word to evoke a feeling, try to go back to something that technically speaks of your point. It&#39;s annoying to do, since a single word can summerize at times. I think though, that it can evoke more rationality in your point.<br/>
There are always many pathways to get across, what your saying.
Very quickly can things change, and &#39;demonized.&#39; Look at the view, history of the swastika in the west. A symbol of unity for thousands of years across many cultures, and 4 years of history, and now anything associated with it is &#39;Evil.&#39;   Be careful to explain  yourself, instead of using &#39;Hot&#39; words. 
I&#39;m saying all of this, because I like what you are saying, and believe you can reach others with your words. =]</p>

<p>This line of thought is entirely backwards. If you seek to control the external, you will only reinforce the strength of the simulation. Desire to control the external is what leads people to manipulate and subjugate one another. We need to break the control altogether, not seize it away from those who currently hold it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that line and all the upvotes really annoyed me - sound like more unnecessary ruling all over again.

    <div class="md"><p>You do realise that the kind of thing you believe in was invented by those with psychological divergence and high functionality, right - not just the average person? So technically you should try to become more like them if you want to transcend, but instead you choose to be conformist, demeaning and <em>hateful of what you don’t understand</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humans are amazing, humanity outside the influence of Jesus is stunning, and I have chosen to embrace my human side as much as anyone/anywhere/possible. </p>

<p>Be happy dude. Love, creativity, and free will. Thats the real triad and it is as awake as anyone in existence will ever be. </p>

<p>So strive to be like heartless enslaved pedo sociopaths? Not a chance.</p>

<p>One may posses all the intelligence and high functioning in the multiverse but if you don’t know love, nobody loves you back by choice, and are not free to think and believe on your own, then whats the point?</p>

<p>Id fight the whole damn everything for my kids, family, brothers and sisters everywhere.. and they know that, let alone my God. </p>

<p>So again, all the thinking in the world? </p>

<p>Nah it wont even get you close to awake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do really agree with that. I suppose maybe it’s just my personal experiences with seeing how those who behave socially differently are treated. Of course it’s not all about “intelligence”, I just wish people weren’t so judgmental towards each other (admittedly I’ve committed the same mistake in questioning it so specifically). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All good, and yes indeed my implicit point for the entire part of the universe  that doesn’t get this is that self worship (sun worship, or narcissism) sucks because its an inward, hollow, and frankly i find myself worshipping myself to be quite boring kind of thing.</p>

<p>Being loved outwardly? By beings with free will? Whoa now thats a real phenomenon. </p>

<p>Love is ontologically way higher up the hierarchies then the mindless repetition worship or control affords. </p>

<p>And when people choose to love you, faults, failures, and fears and all....?</p>

<p>Like I said earlier, if theres any way an internet stranger can help you through the meat grinder a little easier, pm or lmk.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep true, in fact I feel like I’m always being challenged to either choose selfless love that is part of the divine or a narcissistic life here. A year ago I was ready to leave the world (not through death, of course) but just as I almost did, I feel like it was my humanly ego that pulled me back out before I could change. Following that came terrible events and mental illness worse than I’ve ever known to the point of near death, as well as being targeted by a demonic entity/the “dark occult”. Even now, I can never really let go, even though I know now that this world is a lie (though not in a cynical sense that dismisses it all). <em>sigh</em>. Maybe due to some important reason, maybe my weak ego, I don’t know. I’m glad others are doing this though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah hang in there, the existence here Jesus forces upon us is pretty stupid but hopefully by powering through one of us can convince God to shut it down. Who knows, anything is possible.</p>

<p>You’re definitely not alone, unless of course we live in a fault tolerant silo style matrix, then unfortunately we are all alone.</p>

<p>But wouldn’t be doing our job if we didn’t try. Remember they have zero power over your soul. Thats the one thing that cant go near.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don’t worry, I have realised that a solipsistic nightmare is not what is in store (spiritually speaking, if it was, it would be insignificant). I used to think that in paranoia while experiencing dissociation and all, but I “realised” (as best as I can describe it) through almost breaking free that said perceived loneliness is just part of the trapping illusion that exists through being non-spiritual. </p>

<p>It’s the process of trying to break free that is hard, uncertain and frightening. Of course, I’m still in the midst of this material spider’s web. It sure tried to kill me and convince me that my near-evolution never happened when I was “back in” (although I barely let myself leave for even a spec of a moment and I never meant to on purpose - shows the justice in all this). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting comments. </p>

<p>I think at some point the projected hatred (from the perpetrator) some experience is just so dumb that it cant be real or if it is why are such hateful pieces of shit even allowed to exist?</p>

<p>And at some even further point down that same line, it becomes impossible to rectify an all seeing and loving God with the behaviors of these shit stain hate filled mindless slaves?</p>

<p>By hating theirselves, they reject their own existence, then they are allowed to violate my children and my own free will?</p>

<p>If you truly hate yourself like these cowards do, why exist at all? </p>

<p>In opening you mentioned “higher functioning” beings several times, and Im here to tell you, after a really, really long trip through the one big rabbit hole, I have have yet to find any of these beings that are truly higher functioning when simply contrasted against the natural laws of existence.</p>

<p>If anything, they seem to expend an inordinate amount of effort, as individuals and as groups, <em>to be unhappy.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they do, though in recent research I think it is contrived occultism that make them do evil things, trying to combine light energy with dark energy to gain power. Of course, this in itself is a trap that they believe in, like becoming addicted to a hallucinogenic drug because of its amazing complex visuals. They love the high of the energy, and so just as it is hard for us to be saints, it reinforces their knack of being evil due to how beautiful and secretly self-trapping it is at the same time. </p>

We tend to like words that evoke feelings in us, and stand by feelings, instead of rational. Many news stations, government understand this psychology, and shamelessly use wording like this to manipulate emotions in people. If I say collusion, what thoughts, feelings come to mind, what if I say terrorists, immigrants. Many of those words have been breed to evoke strong emotions in us.
