        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The peak of that stuff on this sub-reddit is probably the exact time I noticed this sub changed. Down-vote brigades were fucking mega-heavy on random threads/comments, and a lot of the meta threads that called it out were massively brigade&#39;d, until it was pointed out that it was brigade&#39;d, and then would reach the front page of the sub-reddit.</p>

<p>Did this sub finally pop up as a blip on someone&#39;s radar? There&#39;s a ton of mis-information on here now, as well. The amount of people calling each other a shill is so high. Go to a thread that&#39;s over a year or two old on this sub-reddit, and you&#39;ll see the difference in how people talked to each other in the comments section.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for saying this... my favorite conspiracy is that news reports things as debunked without any actual debunking.

Not doing something like that just helped fuel a conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guarantee that doing that would have no effect in the best case, and pour fuel on it in the worst case. You really think people would change their mind? That they wouldn&#39;t assume it all to be an elaborate ruse to con truth seekers into laying down their arms? There is no evidence - NONE - that would ever convince many of these people that nothing nefarious happened at Comet Pizza. James Alefantis could be dragged through the mud in a long public trial and they would be screaming bloody murder if he were found innocent. (Of course there would have to be evidence of wrongdoing to have a trial in the first place, but you get the idea.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It might not help the conspiratorial fundamentalists, but it might the more rational among us. </p>

<p>The point of the post was simply that the news rarely does any actually debunking. Viewers are trusting enough to assume that they&#39;ve debunked it, and that take it at face value.</p>

<ul>
<li>The DNC rigging the primary was &quot;debunked&quot;... then it came out that they did.</li>
<li>William Binney&#39;s assessment of the DNC hack was &quot;debunked&quot;... but best case his assessment is inconclusive. </li>
<li>Seth Rich&#39;s involvement in the hack was &quot;debunked&quot;... I&#39;m not suggesting that he did or didn&#39;t do it, I&#39;m just saying we don&#39;t know.</li>
</ul>

<p>The point is... if there is a narrative that isn&#39;t complimentary to the powers that be, they are just lazily &quot;debunking&quot; it. The fourth branch of government is to blame for the current state of things, IMO. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate <em>specifically</em> has been debunked. However, secret pedophile rings <em>do</em> exist. Multiple times a year we hear news of massive arrests from them.</p>

<p>The idea that a pizza place does it in their non-existent basement does not.</p>

<p>Jumping on the ‘pizza’ term to me seemed like an orchestrated gaslighting plan to both muddy the waters around the actual rings, while trying to use pedophiles as a political attack, with nothing to back it up at all.</p>

<p>Most of the people dismissing ‘pizzagate’ <em>know</em> these rings exist, but view <em>this specific instance</em> as a made up political attack, with less than zero evidence, and plenty of strands in the theories as easily disprovable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to mention they fucking banned the sub! 
If it&#39;s such a joke, why shut it down?
I don&#39;t really belive there&#39;s anything there, definately freaky degenerates.
Why is there so many controversial subs allowed, but not a pizza mystery?</p>

<p>I always look to where the resistance is coming from. It&#39;s like playing defensive line. The offense is always trying to disguise what its true intentions are. They will use fakes and movement to get you off the scent. What you have to do is feel which way they are trying to push you and fight it no matter what your eyes see. If you can&#39;t break the hold, at least hold you ground.</p>

<p>The greatest example of this is the occupy Wall Street dismantling. it was consistently belittled in the media. When they didn&#39;t work City council&#39;s around the world held secret meetings to go in the middle of the night and confinscate, people&#39;s tents, laptops and bongo drums.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen governments work so well and coordinated together and it was only because their masters were being called out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I think that the shills are a little lost and are now just astroturfing themselves.... Most of the real people saw a spade when it happened, and left. This left the shills to basically just design an &quot;alternative&quot; media source for the people that just saw through the first veil (media outlets) and think they are moving on to the truth. In reality, the untruth is just a step ahead of the mainstream. So if that is you: Please keep that in mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This might come as a huge surprise, but the actual &quot;left&quot; doesn&#39;t actually have any shills, because the actual left is anti-capitalism / modern corporations. There are professional/urban centrists/liberals who are <em>called</em> leftists in the United States, but that group explicitly approves of capitalism and merely wants a welfare state in addition.</p>

<p>So, to break it down:</p>

<p>Left: Almost certainly no paid shills, because there aren&#39;t any leftist megadonors capable of such a thing.</p>

<p>Centrists: Plenty of paid shills, from your ShareBlue content to your CorrectTheRecord and so forth.</p>

<p>Right: Paid shills out of the fucking ass, given that right-wing policies are emphatically pro-elite, anti-majority, and can&#39;t stand on their own without FUD about brown people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The change OP is referring to is always what happens when T_D invades a sub. They just spam pro-Trump propaganda and shit all over anyone who tells them to stop, without having any respect for what the culture and ideas of the sub were like before. </p>

<p>They are divisive and argue with anyone who isn&#39;t a complete slave to Trumpism. Whenever anyone tries to speak out against them they are attacked and called &#39;shill&#39; or &#39;cuck&#39;. But this is the internet and people don&#39;t just roll over and give in when assholes invade their internet forums, they argue back, because people like arguing over the internet. So the sub devolves into a back and forth between Trump dick-suckers and other redditors that just want the interesting content they saw on the sub before it was invaded to come back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>im old.  The whole pizzagate basis was creating a secret code from emails.  Didn&#39;t pass the sniff test. Hence me calling it corny.  is there a child sex abuse problem?  Yes.  Is anything really being done.  Not in my opinion.  Do I believe it is a partisan issue.  No.  And that was the number one glaring piece of bull about pizzagate, it was partisan nonsense</p>
