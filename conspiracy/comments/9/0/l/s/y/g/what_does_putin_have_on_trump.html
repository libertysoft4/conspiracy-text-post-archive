    <div class="md"><p>First off, I didn&#39;t write this. I read it on the GA sub, and while I&#39;m not a follower of Q, this theory definitely raises some eye brows for me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Grand Jury had been impaneled.</p>

<p>Governments from around the world had donated to the “Charity”.</p>

<p>Yet, from 2001 to 2003 none of those “Donations” to the Clinton Foundation were declared.</p>

<p>Hmm, now you would think that an honest investigator would be able to figure this out.</p>

<p>Guess who took over this investigation in 2002?</p>

<p>None other than James Comey.</p>

<p>Now, that’s interesting, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Guess who was transferred in to the Internal Revenue Service to run the Tax Exemption Branch of the IRS? Lois Lerner...</p>

<p>Now, that’s interesting, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Guess who ran the Tax Division inside the Department of Injustice from 2001 to 2005?</p>

<p>None other than the Assistant Attorney General of the United States, Rod Rosenstein.</p>

<p>Guess who was the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation during this timeframe???  Robert Mueller.  </p>

<p>What do all four casting characters have in common?</p>

<p>They all were briefed and/or were front line investigators into the Clinton Foundation Investigation.</p>

<p>Let’s fast forward to 2009, shall we?</p>

<p>James Comey leaves the Justice Department to go and cash-in at Lockheed Martin.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton is running the State Department, on her own personal email server by the way.</p>

<p>The Uranium One “issue” comes to the attention of the Hillary.</p>

<p>Like all good public servants do, you know looking out for America’s best interest, she decides to support the decision and approve the sale of 20% of US Uranium to” no other than?</p>

<p>However, prior to the sales approval, no other than Arkansas Bill goes to Moscow, gets paid 500K for a one hour speech then meets with Vladimir Putin at his home for a few hours.</p>

<p>Well, not so fast, the FBI had a mole inside the money laundering and bribery scheme.</p>

<p>Guess who was the FBI Director during this timeframe?</p>

<p>Yep, Robert Mueller.</p>

<p>He even delivered a Uranium Sample to Moscow in 2009.</p>

<p>Guess who was handling that case within the Justice Department out of the US Attorney’s Office in Maryland.</p>

<p>No other than, Rod Rosenstein.</p>

<p>Guess what happened to the informant?</p>

<p>The Department of Justice placed a GAG order on him and threatened to lock him up if he spoke out about it.</p>

<p>How does 20% of the most strategic asset of the United States of America end up in Russian hands when the FBI has an informant, a mole providing inside information to the FBI on the criminal enterprise?</p>

<p>~145 million dollars in “donations” made their way into the Clinton Foundation from entities directly connected to the Uranium One deal.</p>

<p>Guess who was still at the Internal Revenue Service working the Charitable Division?</p>

<p>No other than, Lois Lerner.</p>

<p>Ok, that’s all just another series of coincidences, nothing to see here, right?</p>

<p>Let’s fast forward to 2015.</p>

<p>Due to a series of tragic events in Benghazi and after the 9 “investigations” the House, Senate and at State Department, Trey Gowdy who was running the 10th investigation as Chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi discovers that the Hillary ran the State Department on a unclassified, unauthorized, outlaw personal email server.</p>

<p>He also discovered that none of those emails had been turned over when she departed her “Public Service” as Secretary of State which was required by law.</p>

<p>He also discovered that there was Top Secret information contained within her personally archived email.</p>

<p>I will spare you the State Departments cover up, the nostrums they floated, the delay tactics that were employed and the outright lies that were spewed forth from the necks of the Kerry State Department, we shall leave it with this…… they did everything humanly possible to cover for the Hildabeast.</p>

<p>Now this is amazing, guess who became FBI Director in 2013?</p>

<p>Guess who secured 17 no bid contracts for his employer with the State Department and was rewarded with a six million dollar thank you present when he departed his employer.</p>

<p>No other than James Comey.</p>

<p>Now he is the FBI Director in charge of the “Clinton Email Investigation” after of course his FBI Investigates the Lois Lerner “Matter” at the Internal Revenue Service and exonerates her.</p>

<p>Can you guess what happened next?</p>

<p>In April 2016, James Comey drafts an exoneration letter of Hillary Rodham Clinton, meanwhile the DOJ is handing out immunity deals like candy.</p>

<p>They didn’t even convene a Grand Jury.</p>

<p>Like a lightning bolt of statistical impossibility, like a miracle from God himself, James steps out into the cameras of an awaiting press conference on July the 8th of 2016, and exonerates the Hillary from any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Can you see the pattern?</p>

<p>I could go on, Rosenstein becomes Asst. Attorney General, Comey gets fired based upon a letter by Rosenstein, Comey leaks government information to the press, Mueller is assigned to the Russian Investigation sham by Rosenstein to provide cover for decades of malfeasance within the FBI and DOJ and the story continues.</p>

<p>FISA Abuse, political espionage..... pick a crime, any crime, chances are...... this group and a few others did it.</p>

<p>All the same players.</p>

<p>All compromised and conflicted.</p>

<p>All working fervently to NOT go to jail themselves.</p>

<p>All connected in one way or another to the Clinton&#39;s.</p>

<p>How many lives have these two destroyed?</p>

<p>It cannot be numbered.</p>

<p>As of this writing, the Clinton Foundation, in its 20+ years of operation of being the largest International Charity Fraud in the history of mankind, has never been audited by the Internal Revenue Service.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion, it has to. The federal government... they are aware the public has no trust left in the justice system. That trust is vital and I believe the entirety of Trumps presidency is a plan to restore that faith in the system by initiating the largest criminal take down in the history of our civilization. The &#39;problem&#39; is they have to do it as slow as molasses. If you&#39;ve ever done any type of government work you&#39;d know that is how they operate. Slow as all hell, but 100% accountable and done thoroughly. It&#39;s the same process here. Trump could declassify everything tomorrow, but the it would be too much too soon. They have to build the foundation, slowly leak the information, slowly box in the bad actors to force them into mistakes, get the public to start asking questions on their own and demanding answers the government is waiting for them to ask the right questions to. In my opinion, this process is years in the making. It honestly is why I think Trump is so confident and so willing to stray the line, because he isn&#39;t actually making decisions, he&#39;s just following a plan that is already laid out, he knows what the end game is going to be because it&#39;s already been planned out. </p>

<p>It&#39;s no coincidence that more and more lately the public is discussing pedophile accusations politically and in Hollywood.  The amount of CEO&#39;s who have resigned since Trump was elected, the amount of Senators and House members on BOTH sides not seeking reelection during a presidents first midterm (unheard of)... there is just so much movement going on behind the scenes that isn&#39;t happening just because. When Trump said he was going to drain the &#39;swamp&#39;, I don&#39;t think we all ever understood how big, how corrupt and how far reaching the &#39;swamp&#39; really is.</p>

<p>Sounds hyperbolic, but everything is pointing in that directions and this was in my opinion.</p>

<p>Of course I could be completely 100% wrong and everything is just a coincidence and Trump is just winging it and getting lucky every time, but I seriously doubt that at this point even if I didn&#39;t want to. </p>

<p>SOMETHING will have to give eventually. </p>

<p>Why hasn&#39;t trump ordered an investigation? Can he?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>because he&#39;s surrounded by double agents, shills, neocons, zionists, deep staters all who get the same money from the same lobbyists are all part of the same secret society club.</p>

<p>Something like this would take years to untangle to see who is who. He&#39;d have to release false rumors to see who the leakers are, he had to do &quot;construction&quot; in the white house to get rid of the bugs the feds planted, and all the while hollywood and MSM zionists are all cooperating against him with a Mueller (Uranium one Hillary shill) witch hunt against him, while they give th Podestas immunity.</p>

<p>I&#39;m fucking sick to my stomach just thinking about how badly we are taken over.</p>

<p>I think the Russian meeting is a backup plan/ Trump was handed Terabytes of info from Putin, probably all sorts of reports about who is who, who is a double agent, who is crooked, and so on:</p>

<p><a href="https://americaoutloud.com/putin-gives-trump-160-terabytes-of-communication-intercepts/">https://americaoutloud.com/putin-gives-trump-160-terabytes-of-communication-intercepts/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing this has the Tarmac meeting, HRC e-mails, the DOJ emails ok&#39;ing the Russian lawyer (spy/double agent) to set of Trump Jr, and so on.</p>

<p>With the Russian intel, he becomes untouchable by the swamp, so all they can do is cry and bitch about what just happened.</p>

<p>Regardless, I think Deep State is going to attempt a Coup or an assassination against him</p>

<p><a href="https://www.greanvillepost.com/2018/07/19/coming-coup-against-trump/">https://www.greanvillepost.com/2018/07/19/coming-coup-against-trump/</a></p>

<p>Well said. This isn&#39;t something that can happen in a couple months or even a year. This is essentially a hard truth based shift of the collective cultural zeitgeist and it has to come from the bottom up. That takes time to happen organically, and it will be extremely painful for many once we know enough. </p>

<p>I&#39;m extremely worried for his safety as well. I don&#39;t think they will JFK him, but if they did I would not be surprised at all at this point. He is disrupting billion dollar industries and threatening the existence of century old power structures. Lucky for the people, he has the absolute finest people in the world guarding him (US Marines) so that takes a bit of the edge off. </p>

<p>You&#39;re in the right place! Nothing would surprise me at this point!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean it must be bad for it to make trump grovel at his shoes the way he has been</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you expand on this a bit. I take &quot;groveling&quot; to mean Trump initially questioning the Mueller investigation&#39;s findings. Is that correct? It seems our own intelligence agencies have a history that would lend credence to the theory that much of this is fabricated to frame another nation for the wrongdoings of our own masters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump attacks his country&#39;s closest allies but praises putin to the point of seeming incredibly disingenuine. His demeanor is very weak around Putin and never says anything bad about a guy who is actually a pretty bad guy. Why be strongarmed towards countries who&#39;s people have died along with Americans for causes America believed in, but praise a former KGB agent oligarch who has repeatedly undermined America&#39;s democracy? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Trump isn&#39;t compromised (and I happen to believe he is in some way), Putin is the type of &quot;ruler&quot; Trump wishes he was more like. After this term he&#39;ll have been president of Russia for 25 years. Trump wants that kind of devotion from his country, and I think he aims to emulate the socially conservative bent Putin embraces (to tide over the serious christians and the rising theocracy, which is probably the &quot;silent majority&quot; of most countries, east and west. And one of the easiest to manipulate). Ditto the oligarchy structure and corporate coup-- except Russians have some form of universal healthcare and other socialistic aspects, which Trump can&#39;t embrace since Reagan wed the far right with the theocracy in the US. </p>

<p>So if he isnt indebted to Putin in the end, he&#39;s simply a fanboy of a slick and smart politician who&#39;s also a &quot;strongman.&quot;</p>

<p>Well said. This isn&#39;t something that can happen in a couple months or even a year. This is essentially a hard truth based shift of the collective cultural zeitgeist and it has to come from the bottom up. That takes time to happen organically, and it will be extremely painful for many once we know enough. </p>

<p>I&#39;m extremely worried for his safety as well. I don&#39;t think they will JFK him, but if they did I would not be surprised at all at this point. He is disrupting billion dollar industries and threatening the existence of century old power structures. Lucky for the people, he has the absolute finest people in the world guarding him (US Marines) so that takes a bit of the edge off. </p>
