    <div class="md"><p>If it&#39;s already being covered in other subs, why repeat it here? OP has a point; nearly every post in the top few pages is about topics covered extensively elsewhere, or criticisms of those same posts taking up space. we are definitely being heavily brigaded, and unless something is done then all that iwll be left are distractions. So how about instead of making nebulous accusations you make some constructive input, or do you think every is fine how it is now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They may be covered extensively on other subs but not from a conspiracy perspective.  This is also one of the few subs that does not reflexively ban material.  There is a reason subscribers are increasing —this sub is the closest thing to free speech on reddit. If ppl are posting those topics here, it’s for a reason:  censorship, conspiracy elements are becoming more apparent (ppl waking), there is interest from this community. </p>

<p>If ppl don’t want to deal with those topics, they should keep scrolling.  Is there a space limitation?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read through the subs in question; there is very little discussion going on. Attempts at discussion are attacked with typical <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> techniques.

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, true. I just find responding to brigading to to be pointless, because the volume factor and downvoting means any valid posts are unlikely to be read by other real users, and of course the brigaders dont care what is said to them; they will just respond from their textbook of techniques. Anyway, thanks for the good response.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fine to post all the Russiagate narratives you want. But relying on such medium day after day for your narratives is just not in the spirit of a sub that understands the relationship between the media and people in power.</p>

<p>Posting only Fox or Wapo or NYTimes just seems out of sort here. It just feels like a constant appeal to authority, considering the influence that these players hold. I&#39;ve posted an article from all the above sources and would prefer the next time I do to not give any clicks to them.</p>

<p>Since we have a transparent modlog, I think this could easily work. If the kids ever abused the rules, anyone would be able to call them out, and the community would be able to tell if it was justified or not.</p>
