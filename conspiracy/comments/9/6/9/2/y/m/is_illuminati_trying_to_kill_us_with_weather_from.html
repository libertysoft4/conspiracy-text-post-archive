<p>Anyway it feels like the last 10-20 years were some kind of testing of this and that methods of how to kill humans effectively without provoking nuke war.</p>

<p>Ebola, zika, extreme cold, extreme heat, constant wildfire, unusual drought, constant earthquake, constant hurricane and flood, unprecedented hail or snowstorm.....</p>

<p>Now from this year, it seems like they&#39;ve decided weather is best weapon to kill us, with occasional ebola or intended wildfire.</p>

<p>Extreme weather can destroy everything from plants to humans, while rich people can survive it. And it&#39;s kind of natural disaster, nature itself can heal soon after population has decreased enough.</p>

<p>So....is this the year they have finally decided to kill us with weather?
 Until about 2030?
Because media are saying this extreme weather will escalate at least till 2030 as if it&#39;s the planned schedule. (How do they know? While they can&#39;t predict next year&#39;s weather)</p>

<p>Of course I don&#39;t know jack sxxt about the truth, it&#39;s just... I doubt this is normal global warming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here on Reddit r/poleshift was banned 4 years ago, this is one of the many things being kept from the average earth human.</p>

<p>The poles are shifting and the elites want us to think it is man made so that they can enact a greater control system and tax carbon.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no different than in ancient times when only the few &quot;elites&quot; knew when the eclipse would come and they used it to extort people by telling them they were taking the sun away.</p>

<p>Nah. They just pretend they care, but they don&#39;t. They are behind those low fertility and birth rates and then they go: &quot;Hey, you need to have more babies. Why don&#39;t you have more babies?&quot;</p>

<p>Birth rate and fertility doesn&#39;t tell the whole story - you must include life expectancy which is SO much higher than it was 75 yrs ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weather is definitely killing us; 100,000 deaths from heat alone in the last decade or so. Here in Australia, certain parts have gone from lush &amp; green from the last cyclone, to severe drought. Having said that, most parts of our continant (sp?) are in drought; this is our driest winter in my locale for the last 5 years.</p>

<p>My inlaws sold their 1600 hectare farm in Central Queensland owing to crops that they couldn&#39;t do anything with bar cattle fodder- severe frosts on their sorghum one year, no rain for 14 months the next. Cattle were the only thing keeping them afloat. They now own 5 hectares more of a hobby farm type thing for pocket money &amp; our kids. </p>

<p>I have always had a small vegie patch, but this year it is really struggling- water table is really low, so had to start hand watering; temps go from 35°C (in winter ffs!) , down to 0°C within days. The weather is so fucking weird man. Only have to look at global crop losses- not just from drought, but weather extremes in general- to start to think they are trying to kill people off via food shortages.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of the forest fires are in predominantly white areas and they have wiped out a total area the size of Delaware.</p>

<p>I think 10 people died at the last count. Hundreds of homes burned.</p>

<p>So far they’ve caught two arsonists, one black and one Hispanic.</p>
