        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don’t have a personal FB account. I haven’t had one since 2013 and I am basically a social media ghost. I still like memes and looking at random shit so I do have some anon social media accounts. On FB...I have an account where I follow funny groups, interesting public pages, etc. I don’t have any friends on there and I don’t interact with anyone I know in real life. I basically just comment on memes and have a laugh with other people commenting on memes, but this is seldom. I probably open it once a month. </p>

<p>My name fictional and my location on FB is the other side of the world from where I live. I just picked random stuff when I made it. </p>

<p>Because fb doesn’t really know where I am (or maybe they do) and I don’t interact with anyone local, they’re always throwing me the funniest, most random friend suggestions. Literally anyone from anywhere is suggested to me and it’s never anyone I know. </p>

<p>This is the weird or at least interesting thing. </p>

<p>There’s this kid who lives in my apartment complex and I see him here and there but I’ve never spoken to him. </p>

<p>I can only recognize him by face and I know nothing about him. </p>

<p>I was walking from work today and I think he was walking to his job because he had a uniform on. </p>

<p>We passed each other on the sidewalk and we both did that awkward thing where you look away and avoid eye contact. </p>

<p>I kind of thought about him for a bit..just as you wonder about a person on my way home. </p>

<p>When I came home, i ate, chilled and opened FB for the first time in a while and guess who was suggested to me?</p>

<p>HIM</p>

<p>so wtf </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t know much about FB, I haven’t been on there in years, but they most likely do track your location. It is a possibility that they noticed you two live in the same apartment complex, suggesting him as your friend. But this is still pretty freaky. </p>

<p>You also have to think about how FB could have possibly known that you two passed each other. Unless your phone camera was out and saw his face and FB secretly logged his face and used it to suggest a friend, I doubt they are watching you.</p>

<p>Still pretty weird though. The only thing I can think of is that FB recognized both of your signals in the same place. Very weird.</p>

<p>They track you location and you guys are neighbors so always close. not hard to connect those dots.</p>

<p>While we&#39;re at it though they also tap your Mic (even if the app is closed) and will use your account to advertise for them. (Those ads that are like so and so likes Old Navy)</p>

I think it changed from just sharing things and expressing yourself to gaining followers and being famous.

I don’t blame them though because I am aware of these things too and I don’t really try to hide or something. It’s kind of normal for a lot of younger people because we’re desensitized.
