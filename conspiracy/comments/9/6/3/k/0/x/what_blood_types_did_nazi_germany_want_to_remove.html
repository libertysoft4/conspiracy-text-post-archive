    <div class="md"><p>Having a negative Rhesus factor is quite rare for the human race (only about 8% are negative, including myself as A-). Although science still can’t definitively answer why there are humans lacking this Rhesus Factor, some conspiracy theorists claim these humans in particular share a genetic makeup with an unknown being more superior than primates. We know that those WITH a positive Rhesus factor share a common ancestry with apes. Who knows. There aren’t exactly certain answers for any of it.</p>

<p>The most populated place in the world of Rh- are in the Basque region (Europe), who are also mostly A-. Some German theorists believed Aryans also had blood type A. Apparently Hitler was blood type A.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rh- is only found in a very small percentage of the population, roughly 10-15%. I believe Hitler  thought those people were Aryans and have a tendency to be tall, fair skin blonde/red hair and usually blue/green eyes. Some believe they are descendants of ETs and/or Atlantis. The Basque region of Spain has the highest percentage of people with Rh- blood in the world apparently. </p>

<p>A pregnant woman who is Rh- can&#39;t have a child that is Rh+ without medical treatment. Her body might recognize the baby as a foreign being and develop antibodies to attack it because Rh+ and Rh- blood do not mix. So she potentially could have a miscarriage. </p>

<p>So this is very interesting to me because I am Rh-. Im also very tall and have green eyes. You can get a test kit on Amazon for like 5$.   This subject seems to be a sensitive topic in the PC world for whatever reason. Interesting stuff, I&#39;m excited to see how the research plays out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was born with hazel eyes that turned green. Sometimes they do change back and forth for whatever reason, as crazy as it sounds. My mom is actually the one that points it out to me after they change. Pretty strange.</p>

<p>Yes absolutely. Funny you ask.  I definitely feel like something isn&#39;t compatible. I do respect and get along with everyone but it seems like I&#39;m just watching everyone do their thing but I have no interest in what they are doing. I&#39;m interested in things that even my close friends either don&#39;t comprehend or simply just don&#39;t care about. Then I sit there in shock wondering how they aren&#39;t interested or tell me they just don&#39;t want to think about it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming you get similar reactions from people?</p>

<p>Yes! Blue to green here. Blue comes out when I&#39;m content and a fierce green when I&#39;m pissed off or emotional. People can tell and have told me. Resting eyes is a blueish green. Balance. It&#39;s a very interesting topic.  </p>

<p>Actually, she&#39;d be fine with her first child. It&#39;s only if she got pregnant again with an Rh+ baby that her body would have the necessary antibodies to attack and make her sick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nazi medical knowledge was not terribly refined. Much of their research focused on demonstration of racial superiority and they were not terribly rigorous about their research... as happens when the priority in your research is meeting political aims rather than advancing science. </p>

<p>They later carried out medical experimentation of concentration camp prisoners and prisoners of war... many of these experiments, in addition to being gratuitously gruesome and inhumane were also  just really bad science. </p>

<p>Now the luftwaffe and some other military branches carried out some rather gratuitously gruesome and inhumane experiments on various victims, but these were slightly better conducted because they were trying to facilitate the development of practical things like life better life support for future fighter jets and that data was seized post war by the allies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He might have been more interested in race than blood type.  Link here is a good &quot;map&quot; of who he thought the Aryans were.  To me it seems he meant more like Nordic.  </p>

<p>The Aryans here are &quot;R&quot; and/or &quot;G&quot;, and Hitler had a dismissive view of SE Europeans.  The Nordic/Hitler Aryan is the &quot;I&quot;</p>

<p>RH- is also Gaelic and Berber.  Along with the Basque, basically the same people.  In one theory, they&#39;re the Atlantean refugees that went east and landed on the highlands of Wales, Spain, and Morocco (and the Canary Islands though they are not there now).  Seems to overlap with &quot;I&quot;.</p>
