    <div class="md"><p>For the record I appreciate Zues&#39; hard work and time. He puts fascinating info and names connections of &quot;untouchables&quot; in his work, it&#39;s brilliant. So I also appreciate his bravery because this stuff isn&#39;t a game. I&#39;ve seen you come to his defense or recommend his work before, so I have a suspicious feeling that you either know each other or this is his alt because he&#39;s been banned, I believe. That might be wrong, I&#39;m not sure. Anyway to the point. I would love it if he would add some sources to his work. It&#39;s extremely difficult to find info on the families and organizations he is exposing. I&#39;ve tried a dm to his account and it either didn&#39;t go through or I didn&#39;t hear a response,no problem. I just think that would go a long way with his credibility, which some question. Anyway, have a good one brother.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They say I am an alt of many</p>

<p>Zeus has said many times where /most/ his sources come from, biographys, newspapers articles, history books and google. </p>

<p>I question a lot of what he writes aswell, but most is easily sourced on google.  </p>

<p>You can also comment on one of his posts asking for a source on a specific statement.  </p>

<p>The reason I recommend Zeus all the time is because he exposes everyone, he doesn&#39;t seem to take sides either, wether you are looking for information on the jews, the jesuits, the black nobility, trump, clinton, bush, etc, he has posted information on them all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit, thanks for the quick reply. Not sure if you saw but I edited my comment to withdraw my assumption that you are his alt.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been on his website and read absolutely everything. I did ask for a source here or there but no response. Like I said no big deal, people are busy. I have checked Google for some things and have confirmed some of his claims but other stuff was a strike out. I guess I need to dig harder. I don&#39;t expect anything handed to me on a plate, but I&#39;m a bit lazy so that sure would be nice. Lol.</p>

<p>Totally agree, he goes after everyone, no agenda. Just truth. That&#39;s what I respect most. Anyway appreciate the reply, keep fighting the good fight. Peace brother.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Peace and love to you too my friend, and as I just said to another person, some of his works seem right out too lunch, specially his last post about eminem :S</p>

<p>I ask him questions all the time, and always either get told I&#39;m a spook, or no response, he doesn&#39;t like me, I&#39;ve told him that I think he is a government agent a few times, which wouldn&#39;t suprise me..  </p>

<p>But when it comes to exposing the lie that is politics, I will recommend him and post his info every time..  </p>

<p>tis a fucked up world...  </p>

<p>If your looking for another brilliantly interesting account, I highly recommend u/PieceOfChance  </p>

<p>You can go through my post history, and I&#39;ve reposted my favourite articles of his here in this sub. This user has a clear understanding of what&#39;s going on in this world, and he has brilliant solutions too, like geurilla gardening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Appreciate it. Funny you mention the Eminem post. That&#39;s the one where I just stopped and really couldn&#39;t accept that he&#39;s an elite hacker. I always approach everything with an open mind but it just didn&#39;t make sense to me. I could be wrong though, you never know.</p>

<p>Yeah, he&#39;s extremely defensive in his replies to what seem to be sincere questions. I never understood that. But whatever. People have different defense mechanisms.</p>

<p>I definitely will check that account thanks, I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve seen it before.  I&#39;m also adding yours as a friend on my app so your posts are highlighted. I appreciate your comments and don&#39;t want to miss them. If someone is bringing truth to the table I don&#39;t want to miss it. I&#39;ll see you around,I&#39;m sure..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes i do,a few of his arguments against Zeus are:</p>

<p>jesuits only listen to their superior general, therefore they can&#39;t be controlled.... yet the general is elected every however many years..... so they elect a new world leader every so often? don&#39;t make much sense to me..... </p>

<p>black nobles banned from roman curia...... sounds like roman politics to me... politics is theatre, so i think they just went into hiding</p>

<p>and i forget the rest of his arguments</p>

<p>but he &quot;acts&quot; like getting rid of the jesuits( we do need to ) will solve all the worlds problems, but after jesuits are gone, we are still left with royal/noble bloodlines that have been ruling/living in castles for the past 4000 years, aswell as smom, koc, jesters, shriners, satanists/luciferians, mafias, various other cults.....</p>

<p>rome is bigger than just the jesuits in my opinion...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks for you thoughts, valid points. the power structure is wast, i would add the commies, the nazis, the zionists, the industrialists, the academia/inteligentsia and the intel agencies to that list and of course, the militaries. the militaries and the mic are controlled by them and is the real source of their temporal power.  lets not forget that both the templars and the jesuits, the smom are military orders. knights are for fighting..</p>

<p>i would like to also note that the black pope usually serves until death and only exceptionally they resign for personal reasons, but probably if not certainly keep working on common goals.  it just means they are two of them now. as is the case with the white pope. ratzinger is still around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>agreed.  </p>

<p>As far as AhuwahZeus not responding, he has told me that I am a spook, and will not respond anymore to me either, so i don&#39;t know, some of his stuff is right out to lunch, but a lot of it is good factual information that exposes every side.  </p>

<p>so I shall continue to recommend him when i see people falling for the left vs right divide</p>

    <div class="md"><p>afaik, the vatican created islam (analphapet muhameds rich wife and her uncle were catholics), to create a force against the jews and to take over jerusalem and the holy land for the pope.  the muslim warlords did just that, but didnt hand it over to the pope, rather, they kept it and were ready to conquer europe too.  this was the reason for the crusades.</p>

<p>it really was the medieval equvalent of the al qaeda/isis fiasco of modern times.  the westerners (zbigniew brzezinski and co) created and armed the taliban, the al qaeda and isis terror networks and when they got out of hand, they had to send in american troops to fight their own creation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is utterly utterly ridiculous. Christians had very little to no power in the time of Muhammad, it was mostly pagans who had the power and the majority of Jews were in medina, not in Mecca where the religion started. The Jews lived under Muslim rule in medina completely fine and Jerusalem was not conquered in Muhammad&#39;s lifetime so the idea that it was created by the Vatican is absurd, especially considering there was no Vatican and Islam&#39;s theology is opposite of Christianity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i would argue that vatican is exoteric christian and esoteric satanism/luciferianism/baal worship that is just as pagan as can be something stemming from the babylonian and egyptian mysteries.  true there was no vatican, but there was already a papacy, and the papacy held real temporal power since constantine (4th century), way before muhammed (7th century).</p>
