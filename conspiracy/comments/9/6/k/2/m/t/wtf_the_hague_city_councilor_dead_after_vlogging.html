    <div class="md"><p>Abrahamic religion was created to tame the savage nomads so that a society could be built. They were built in a savage time. Back in those days the leading causes of death were murder, starvation, dying from disease or an infected wound or being killed by wild animals. It established a rudimentary idea of right and wrong that everyone could agree on and also created a court where people could take their claims instead of starting blood feuds. I agree that they are outdated, but not that the common sense of fair treatment that came later through Christianity should be outright disposed of. Otherwise you end up with a  bunch of high functioning savages that dispose of ideas like human rights and we all start loading political prisoners into organ harvesting Van&#39;s or sending them off to death camps. Their has to be a happy medium.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I already explained at another point in this thread, a Muslim man can only have a sexual relationship with a [Jewish, Christian or Muslim] woman to whom he is married, or with a female slave whom he owns. </p>

<p>As I mentioned before, a woman is only a man&#39;s slave if she lives in his house and he provides her food, clothing and shelter. A Muslim man cannot have rape a woman, regardless of her beliefs, and claim that she was his captive/slave and therefore permissible for him. It doesn&#39;t work like that. There are conditions.</p>

<p>If a Muslim man comes into ownership of a female slave, he must wait until she has one menstrual period before he can engage in a sexual relationship with her, in order to confirm that she is not already pregnant. After it is clear that she is not pregnant, he can have intercourse with her, and if she gets pregnant, it is obvious that he is the father. If a free Muslim man has a child with his female slave, the child born of this relationship is free, entitled to inheritance from their father, and must have their food, clothing and shelter provided by their father.</p>

<p>&quot;Rape&quot; is not permissible in Islam, regardless of the woman&#39;s religious beliefs or lack thereof. Sex in Islam comes with conditions, and I tried my best to summarize these above.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because Islam makes no distinction between the two. When it comes to rape, there is no difference whether it is done to a Muslim woman or a non-Muslim one, or if the perpetrator is a Muslim or a non-Muslim. The crime and punishment is the same. Rape is rape dude, there are no loopholes under which it can suddenly be allowed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since when did ISIS or Islamic terrorists become the rightful and designated representatives of what Islam is or what a Muslim should be??? They have been denounced over and over by Muslim scholars and organization all around the world. They are such a tiny minority of the total Muslim population of the earth, less than 0.05% (using a high estimation) of the entire Muslim population worldwide. And yet according to you, they are somehow the true reprentations of Islam? That what they are doing is what Islam is all about? Even though their actions directly contradict and should be harshly punished according to the the teachings of Islam??? That&#39;s a pretty weak argument, clutching at straws. What about the 99.95% of Muslims worldwide who are not Islamic extremists? What about the actual Islamic scholars who preach the complete opposite of ISIS? Should they not be a better representation of the religion than the terrorists who actually perform acts strictly forbidden by their religion?  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.lettertobaghdadi.com">Islamic scholars have literally denounced every single claim made by ISIS</a> on religious grounds using the Quran and Hadith to show how every single claim they make does not actually follow Islamic teachings and is in fact directly the opposite of what the religion preaches.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-is-an-offence-to-islam-says-international-coalition-of-major-islamic-scholars-9756255.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-is-an-offence-to-islam-says-international-coalition-of-major-islamic-scholars-9756255.html</a></p>

<p>Let&#39;s take the article in the OP though, it concerns a &quot;Muslim rape gang&quot;, yet you are bring up ISIS and terrorists, which have nothing to do with Islamic terrorists, and using that as justification for the rape gangs literally by association only and without any evidence to prove such a claim.  </p>

<p>I actually have 3 Qurans in my place, with different transliterations on each copy, and have read through them all. I have 3 Bibles too. Care to bring up any violent verses that are not taken out of context and that when actually read in context, convey something entirely different from the out of context quote?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Islam (Arabic: إسلام‎, IPA: [alʔɪsˈlaːm] (About this sound listen)) is a verbal noun originating from the triliteral root S-L-M which forms a large class of words mostly relating to concepts of wholeness, submission, safeness, and peace.[43] In a religious context it means &quot;voluntary submission to God&quot;.[44][45] Islām is the verbal noun of Form IV of the root, and means &quot;submission&quot; or &quot;surrender&quot;. Muslim, the word for an adherent of Islam, is the active participle of the same verb form, and means &quot;submitter&quot; or &quot;one who surrenders&quot;. The word sometimes has distinct connotations in its various occurrences in the Quran. In some verses, there is stress on the quality of Islam as an internal spiritual state: &quot;Whomsoever God desires to guide, He opens his heart to Islam.&quot;[46] Other verses connect Islam and religion (dīn) together: &quot;Today, I have perfected your religion (dīn) for you; I have completed My blessing upon you; I have approved Islam for your religion.&quot;[47] Still others describe Islam as an action of returning to God—more than just a verbal affirmation of faith.[48] In the Hadith of Gabriel, islām is presented as one part of a triad that also includes imān (faith), and ihsān (excellence).[49][50]</p>

What is inherently bad about agreeing with others about having a Creator? Are those who believe in the Big Bang Theory and the Theory of Evolution also victims of &quot;group think&quot;? </p>

<p>It seems that you&#39;re saying in order to be considered independent thinkers we all have to each come up with our own completely original beliefs, and if our beliefs overlap with someone else&#39;s in any way, that means we&#39;re just mindless drones who copy what other people believe because we can&#39;t think for ourselves. Huh? </p>

<p>Thinking for myself led me to Islam after over a decade of being an Agnostic Atheist, and I&#39;ve since discovered that other people, through their own independent research, have also accepted Islam as their faith. It&#39;s like a bunch of people on different paths winding up at the same location; we didn&#39;t wind up here out of ignorance, or by chance, or out of a desire to conform or because we wanted to join a group of people. Many people are not born Muslims, and revert to Islam after reading about it and discovering that it makes sense to them. Is that so hard to believe?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That 0.05% estimate was including ALL jihadist groups worldwide, not just ISIS. And it is a very high estimate at that. Their numbers still only account for less than 0.05% of all Muslims worldwide. There is a much higher percentage than 0.05% of rapists and murderers among the US population, with the US having more criminals locked up in prison than any nation worldwide. Do we judge the entire American population as being rapists, murderers and criminals? After all, that&#39;s what the statistics tell us. What about the percentage of Americans that support illegal war, or support torture done at Guantanamo Bay? Should we judge all Americans based on that? What about the Christian pedophile priests being uncovered day after day worldwide? Should we judge all Christians based on that? Why are you so quick to judge all Muslims for something committed by a tiny minority whom they have no control over? You say that Islamic terror has been going on for hundreds of years, and yet after all these hundreds of years it still only accounts for less than 0.05% of the Muslim population worldwide. So clearly, 99.95% of Muslims have rejected Islamic terrorism, and don&#39;t believe it to be acceptable according to Islam. If more Muslims wanted to be terrorists, then there would be more terrorists. It&#39;s pretty simple really.  </p>

<p>I do find it very interesting that they have been able to amass billions of dollars worth of equipment and resources worldwide, but then <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/422563-saudi-wahhabism-western-countries/">I read stories like this</a> about how wealthy Western nations have been promoting the spread of Wahhabism and propping up Saudi Arabia, one of the West&#39;s biggest allies, or <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-us-saudi-arabia-arms-fighters-jihadis-military-capability-enhanced-weapons-syria-terrorism-a8112076.html">stories like this</a> which indicate that most of the weapons and resources that ISIS and other terrorist groups have been using can be traced back to the US and Saudi Arabia. <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-12-15/how-texas-plumbers-truck-wound-isis-hands">There are also stories like this</a> which prove that vehicles registered in America somehow ended up in the hands of ISIS too. And then there is <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33997408">the literal arming and training of &quot;rebels&quot; who mysteriously end up being terrorists too.</a>  </p>

<p>So yes, I do find it very interesting, but it&#39;s pretty easy to see where these terrorists are getting their equipment and resources from once you look at the bigger picture. They are being armed by the US and other Western nations with the help of Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>If not, then it is not the religion that is telling them to do so. Some random mullahs and imams are not the ultimate respesentatibe authority on Islam, they do not speak for Islam, there has to be consensus amonths the entire Muslim ummah for something to be considered acceptable according to Islam. That is clearly not the case. The amount of Muslims who said something along those lines can be counted on one hand. There are 1,700,000.000 Muslims in the world.

    <div class="md"><p>Again, Islam makes no distinction between the two. When it comes to rape, there is no difference whether it is done to a Muslim woman or a non-Muslim one, or if the perpetrator is a Muslim or a non-Muslim. The crime and punishment is the same. Rape is rape dude, there are no loopholes under which it can suddenly be allowed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well aren’t they better off in the long run? I see what you mean, but if you think about everything in purely black and white, then no progress is made. Again, look into the Trans-Saharan slave trade and tell me what you think. I only hear people complain and ragging on whites for something like slavery when comparatively speaking whites were the “better” option. They practiced it the shortest amount of time and liberated slaves at their own personal cost. If you were a slave, you would probably pray to God that you were sent to the US South and not to the ME. The reason no one talks about the slave trade in the ME for example, is because the boys that did survive castrations (and the vast majority did not) obviously couldn’t breed and the slave women were exclusively used as sex slaves. There are next to no African slave descendants in the ME because they were absolutely barbaric. Here in the South, they were cruel but at least they were fed and housed appropriately because the owners found them of value. The ones in the ME were disposable so they would merely import more hoards of them. So again, it’s not black and white.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one every said Muslims were perfect, there are people of all races, colors and religions who are just shitty people who don&#39;t practice what their religion tells them to do. It is not something exclusive to Islam. If people who were Muslims treated their slaves harshly, what proof is their that this was done because the religion of Islam instructed them to do so? Is it not possible that they were just bad people sho abused the power structures around them to their own benefit?  </p>

<p>Why is it so hard to differentiate between something committed which is allowed in Islam, and something committed that is completely forbidden in Islam? One is an act according to the teachings of Islam, the other is an act in direct contradiction and the complete opposite of what is acceptable in Islam.  </p>

<p>It is actually quite black and white indeed. It&#39;s quite simple to see and confirm what is acceptable according to Islam, and what is forbidden. Claiming something that is forbidden in Islam as being a common Islamic practice is about as fake news as you can get really.</p>

I would argue before because for me their serious problems with the way they conquered the Arabian peninsula but we can disagree on that. They have their own issues that the Saudis exploit for their own political/financial gain. The Saudis decided to team up with the al Wahhab to give them a religious legitimacy for their conquest. It was pretty smart at the time. They didn’t seem as conquerors but as liberators. Problem is they locked themselves in an alliance with the crazies and they can’t get rid of them. But then again, I’ve heard the rumor that al Wahhab was basically a British plant to make Islam more extreme?

    <div class="md"><p>Do you feel so threatened when confronted with uncomfortable truths that you just back out and give up instead of actually spending a few minutes prosessing the information you read? And then call me a &quot;Muslim apologist&quot; when I never apologized for any Muslims crimes at all. Snowflake much? You might actuallly learn a thing or two if you took the time to read and research, but I guess that&#39;s too much for you to do. Easier to just stick your ears in your fingers and go &quot;la la la la I can&#39;t hear youuuu&quot; like a toddler instead of backing up your argument. If you can&#39;t back up your argument when confronted with conflicting information, you don&#39;t know what you are talking about.  </p>

<p>You didn&#39;t respond to any of the points I brought up and instead just ran away. Good job buddy.</p>

I could give you links to Saudi fatwas where they encourage segregation. Or I can even send you the link and you google words up and see what it says. It wouldn’t make a difference because I’ll say he read the Quran and it doesn’t say it. When clearly, people are doing what I’ll say. Then you just can’t move from there. I didn’t see him mention anything about the Sunna and the Hadiths which are supplemental and critical to understand the whole thing. But again, he can believe what he wants it’s not problem. I just don’t want to be harassed and inundated with comments after I tell you, “I’m not going to reply anymore, have a nice one.” I’m not being mean, and I usually engage with everyone because I think it’s important to talk and not just argue but eh, my patience wore thin. </p>

<p>Yes exactly, and now maybe you can realise that the ME isn&#39;t Rome at all but an occupied state. Because before Christianity, the people of the middle east were monotheists, many of whom believed in Jesus (ebeonites, sabians, gnostics, who the Romans all killed off).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except none of that happened while the Quran was revealed, and so the Quran says nothing about conquering any of those areas. The Muslims after the time time of Muhammad had big armies, and attempted to increase their power as all nations around the world were doing simultaneously.

<p>If a man rapes you, or a person steals from you, and they might be an immigrant or refugee, you have to provide more evidence of the crime than if they were native to the country?

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao you are not even from Germany or Europe. My friend got gang raped by a group of five Muslim men. They came on her and pissed on her and of course fucked her. After she was &quot;released&quot; she called and we went to the hospital with cum stil inside her and we&#39;re trying to get a DNA fingerprint for records. When she mentioned it was &quot;Muslim refugees&quot; that did it, the hospital said that they would make an appointment to have the refugee come in and take a DNA test. </p>

<p>However, refugees can remain pretty  anonymous if they choose to so I have no idea how they would even contact the refugees.... </p>

<p>Another law is that if a refugee comes into your home looking to steal and you shoot him then you go to jail and have to go to trial. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does she know the religion of the people who raped her? That doesn&#39;t even make any sense! Most of the refugees are from war-ravaged African countries, and many of them are also Christian or irreligious! And many Arabs, like Syrians, are also Christian. Like, how can you know your rapists religion?</p>

<p>Also, the language you used is so vile, I can&#39;t even believe that you&#39;re talking about your &quot;friend&quot;. If my friend was raped, I wouldn&#39;t use such vulgar language to explain what happened. Absolutely disgusting and so insensitive. </p>

<p>Muslim men don&#39;t have sex outside of marriage, or in front of other people. Do you know that even a husband and wife have to wash themselves with water in between intercourse? Like, if the husband wants to go around a second time, he and his wife both first have to perform ghusl, which involves washing the entire body, including the hair. </p>

<p>We have rules in our religion, so the suggestion that Muslim men would participate in a group rape of woman is completely ridiculous. Anyone who gangrapes a woman must have no faith in God and the Day of Judgment at all.</p>

So let me guess, if Muslim was so pure then why did Mohammed marry a 6 year old and have sex with her at 9 years old? Do you condone or renounce that action? I&#39;ll wait for another Taqiya response tho. Some people, like me, ACTUALLY can cite the Quran and not just accept statements as facts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>exactly!!! Germany and other countries want to be politically correct and not accused of being racist. If they start admitting that the refugees DO cause rapes and violence at all, then SJWs will be up their ass protesting. Look at what happened to Tommy Robinson for going against the narrative.</p>

<p>Europe has already stated that it needs &quot;new blood&quot; in the form of muslim refugees and sub-saharan refugees...</p>

<p>In Germany, if a refugee committs a crime the article will read (&quot;A Gernan murders 2 people&quot;) no mention of name (because it is foreign), no mention of ethnicity (because &quot;we are all Germans&quot;), no mention of legal status. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the problem is with white authority figures fearing for their own image and reputation. The people you really need to direct your anger toward are white Europeans in positions of power. </p>

<p>In another comment, I mentioned how women who fail to report rapes are helping the rapist to go on to rape other women by concealing the criminal&#39;s identity from law enforcement. A commenter mentioned that women are afraid of what the community will think of them. If law enforcement agents are also afraid of what the community will think about them, and, because of this fear for their image, they let non-white rapists off the hook, then look at this cycle that has been created! Rapists are committing crimes, victims of rape are withholding evidence that could put the rapists in jail, and police officers are ignoring evidence that could put rapists in jail. This isn&#39;t a conspiracy; this is a bunch of people putting their own desires before justice! The rapist put their own wants before doing what is just, the rape victim put their own wants before doing what is just, and the police put their own wants before doing what is just. What a sick society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Muslims do not believe they can rape non-Muslims, and Christians and Jews are not considered &quot;infidels&quot;, but, rather &quot;people of the Book&quot;. </p>

<p>Sex outside of marriage is considered a sin in Islam. Rape is even worse, as it is akin to taking something by force, like taking a person&#39;s property. </p>

<p>In times of war, if a woman (whose people are actively engaged in war against a Muslim army) is taken as a prisoner of war, it is permissible for a Muslim man to engage in a sexual relationship with her, as she is being fed, clothes and housed by the Muslims until her people pay her ransom. It is, however, considered more honorable to ask for her hand in marriage, or to free her as an act of charity. There is non unified Muslim army defending itself against an invasion of people seeking to kill the Muslims simply for being Muslims, however, so no prisoners of war are being taken and this is not applicable to what is being discussed in this thread.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that it is never permissible in the Islamic faith for a man or a group of men to rape a woman, even if she is not a Muslim. </p>

<p>If this woman was really raped by a group of men, it wasn&#39;t because they were practicing Muslims, but rather because <strong>they have thrown away their religion in favor of pursuing their own worldly desires</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And <strong>whoever takes Satan as an ally instead of Allah has certainly sustained a clear loss.</strong></p>

<p>&quot;<strong>Satan promises them and arouses desire in them. But Satan does not promise them except delusion.</strong></p>

<p>&quot;The refuge of those will be Hell, and they will not find from it an escape.</p>

<p>&quot;But the ones who believe and do righteous deeds - We will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. [It is] the promise of Allah, [which is] truth, and <strong>who is more truthful than Allah in statement.</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Paradise is not [obtained] by your wishful thinking nor by that of the People of the Scripture. Whoever does a wrong will be recompensed for it, and he will not find besides Allah a protector or a helper.</p>

<p>&quot;And whoever does righteous deeds, whether male or female, while being a believer - those will enter Paradise and will not be wronged, [even as much as] the speck on a date seed.</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>And who is better in religion than one who submits himself to Allah while being a doer of good and follows the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth?</strong> And Allah took Abraham as an intimate friend.</p>

<p>&quot;And <strong>to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth.</strong> And ever is Allah, of all things, encompassing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>O children of Adam, let not Satan tempt you as he removed your parents from Paradise</strong>, stripping them of their clothing to show them their private parts. Indeed, he sees you, he and his tribe, from where you do not see them. Indeed, We have made the devils allies to those who do not believe.</p>

<p>&quot;And when they commit an immorality, they say, &#39;We found our fathers doing it, and Allah has ordered us to do it.&#39; Say, &#39;Indeed, Allah does not order immorality. <strong>Do you say about Allah that which you do not know?</strong>&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;Say, [O Muhammad], &#39;My Lord has ordered justice and that you maintain yourselves [in worship of Him] at every place [or time] of prostration, and invoke Him, sincere to Him in religion.&#39; Just as He originated you, you will return [to life] -</p>

<p>&quot;A group [of you] He guided, and a group deserved [to be in] error. Indeed, they had taken the devils as allies instead of Allah while they thought that they were guided.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And they say, &#39;When is this promise [i.e., the Day of Judgment], if you should be truthful?&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;They do not await except one blast which will seize them while they are disputing.</p>

<p>&quot;And they will not be able [to give] any instruction, nor to their people can they return.</p>

<p>&quot;And the Horn will be blown; and at once from the graves to their Lord they will hasten.</p>

<p>&quot;They will say, &#39;O woe to us! Who has raised us up from our sleeping place?&#39; [The reply will be], &#39;This is what the Most Merciful had promised, and the messengers told the truth.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;It will not be but one blast, and at once they are all brought present before Us.</p>

<p>&quot;So today no soul will be wronged at all, and you will not be recompensed except for what you used to do.</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed the companions of Paradise, that Day, will be amused in [joyful] occupation -</p>

<p>&quot;They and their spouses - in shade, reclining on adorned couches.</p>

<p>&quot;For them therein is fruit, and for them is whatever they request [or wish]</p>

<p>&quot;[And] &#39;Peace,&#39; a word from a Merciful Lord.</p>

<p>&quot;[Then He will say], &#39;But stand apart today, you criminals.</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;**Did I not enjoin upon you, O children of Adam, that you not worship Satan - [for] indeed, he is to you a clear enemy -</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;And that you worship [only] Me? This is a straight path.</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;And he had already led astray from among you much of creation, so did you not use reason?**</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;This is the Hellfire which you were promised.</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;[Enter to] burn therein today for what you used to deny.&#39;&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haven’t you heard of the concept of Taqiyya in Islam? It’s basically when you call them out for x (rape culture) and they know you are right, but they will lie about it to deceive you. They will essentially lie directly to your face about their practices in order to deceive and obfuscate. </p>

<p>Do not believe it when they tell you rape is not a part of their religion and culture. That’s exactly how Islam spread. It was not peaceful and voluntary - it was forceful. Either you submit or you die was essentially their motto. Islam means submission, so this is not a religion that advocates free thinking. And Muslims who convert to other religions (apostates) can be killed if they are do not come back to Islam within a day. Muhammad was a conqueror not a prophet. Say what you will about Christianity but Jesus advocated the peaceful spread of Christianity through preaching. I’m an atheist btw, so I don’t have a dog in the game really. </p>

<p>Also, Muhammad married a 6/7 year old... they will say they didn’t consummate the marriage until she was of age but does that matter?! Mind you the Hadiths claim she came of age at 9/10 - that’s pedophilia!!!They are taught that the Quran is cannot be incorrect because it is the word of Allah and they are obligated to follow Muhammad. So child marriage is not frowned upon. Plus, they heavily advocate cousin marriages. This is evident in the house of Saud where the women basically must marry within the family so children remain loyal to the house. </p>

<p>They will lie to make people like me seem crazy but I’m not. I study the ME for my MA degree and I used to be an apologist but no more. </p>

<p>Sorry for the rant, I just hate seeing people spread misinformation and practice taqiyya. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because Islam makes no distinction between the two. When it comes to rape, there is no difference whether it is done to a Muslim woman or a non-Muslim one, or if the perpetrator is a Muslim or a non-Muslim. The crime and punishment is the same. Rape is rape dude, there are no loopholes under which it can suddenly be allowed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that doesn&#39;t make any sense, and now you&#39;re just making assumptions about the intentions and motivations of these rapists who may not even exist. Maybe the rape never happened, or maybe the rape happened and the men who did it wanted sex or wanted to degrade a woman. I don&#39;t know, but all of those possibilities are entirely more likely than a man saying, &quot;Oh, if I kidnap a woman she is my slave and I can rape her&quot;. This goes against the mainstream understanding of Islam and its laws and rules, so any person who thinks that way is acting on their own an using the religion to justify their inner wickedness. There is an entire chapter of the Quran about this, called &quot;The Hypocrites&quot;.</p>

<p>The Netherlands did not declare war against all Muslims. The army of the Netherlands has not invaded Muslim-majority countries with the formally declared intention to wage war and kill all of the inhabitants who are Muslims. This woman was not taken as a &quot;prisoner of war&quot;, and her people were not given the chance to ransom her or exchange her for a Muslim prisoner of war. She was not taken as a slave by any of the men; she was allegedly raped and let go. This is impossible in our religion. </p>

<p>If a Muslim man buys a female slave or receives a female slave as war booty (after her people expressed no interest in ransoming her freedom), the man has to wait until she has one menstrual period to confirm that she is not pregnant before he can engage in a sexual relationship with her. If she later becomes pregnant, there will be no question as to who the father is. Paternity and lineage is incredibly important to Muslims. Children born to a Muslim man have the right to inheritance from their father and have the right to have their food, clothing and shelter provided by their father. This supersedes any other desires a person might have; God&#39;s laws have to be followed. A person can&#39;t just rape a woman and disappear into the shadows. What if she becomes pregnant? The woman and child suffers a huge injustice! </p>

<p>This is also the reason why a GANG rape is impossible in our religion! Group sex is animalistic, barbaric, disgusting and a huge sin! Having sex in front of other people is something considered revolting and sinful in our religion. Furthermore, if the woman becomes pregnant, no one knows who the father is, which is, again, a huge sin and shame on the men involved, and they were surely be punished severely in this life and the next.</p>

<p>No person can take what they want from Islam and leave what they don&#39;t like. No man can pretend non-Muslims are, by default, always &quot;at war&quot; with Muslims and that it is therefore fair game to rape their women. Any man who does this will burn forever in a blazing fire. Don&#39;t say this is from our religion when you hardly understand the laws and conditions that define our behaviors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. Rape is FORBIDDEN in Islam, whether it is a Muslim woman or an &quot;infidel&quot; woman, it is forbidden all the same. It is one of the worst sins a Muslim could possibly commit, perhaps even worse than murder. According to Islamic law, the rapist should be stoned to death. Just because some people who happened to be Muslim have committed rape, does not mean the religion allowed them to do so. What the fuck bullshit have you been studying?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like we&#39;re talking in circles here! As u/crazymysteriousman said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Just because some people who happened to be Muslim have committed rape, does not mean the religion allowed them to do so.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If a Jew or a Christian or a Muslim or even a Hindu or a Buddhist commits a crime, like rape or theft, it&#39;s not because their religion instructed them to do it, but because they are wicked inside and decided to pursue their own wordly, lowly desires without any care for how it might affect other people!</p>

<p>You&#39;re trying to make it seem like that group of Pakistani guys raped and groomed girls BECAUSE of Islam, instead of realizing that their LACK OF SINCERITY in their religion is the reason for their sick behavior. So many people on this thread are trying to say that Islam allows or instructs men to rape non-Muslim women. That is an outright lie! If these men believed in God, the laws and boundaries God has set, and the Day of Judgment, they wouldn&#39;t rape or have sex with women to whom they are not married. </p>

<p>How many different ways can we say it? But some people just hate the idea of a belief in God, so they want to say anything they can about Islam no matter how much clear evidence is presented that shows that these accusations are false. </p>

<p>For you your beliefs and for us ours. There is quite obviously nothing that can be said to enlighten a person hellbent on remaining in the dark.</p>

<p>We will all stand in front of our Creator on the Day of Judgment, a Day of which there is no doubt, and we will be questioned about everything we said and did. This life is merely a test of our character, so let us all be wary of making false, defamatory accusations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look around you brother. Look at how amazing this minuscule momentary slice of existence we get to experience <em>can</em> be.</p>

<p>Now look at this being you mention, look at the pure hatred, the violence, the narcissism, the human trafficking, the control, the sadism. </p>

<p>Look at this place. Now remember, the answer is love. God is love. The creator of this place the one whom you claim sent all those “prophets” is not the God of everything, is not a “god” at all, does not believe in free will, or love, or creativity, or intelligence, or courage, and is in fact the sole source of the problem.</p>

<p>Unfortunately my statements are neither false or accusations. The problem is not that I have spoken them, the problem is that they are true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God created this world as a test, it is not meant to be all sunshine and rainbows. The ones who pass the test go to heaven, and the ones who don&#39;t go to hell. He also created the Devil to corrupt the earth, so only the ones who followed Gods teachings and abstained from Satans influence will be accepted into heaven. Humans are given free will, but Satan also has free will to corrupt humans to follow him instead of a God. And one of the consequences of free will is the ability to choose to be as good or as evil as you wish. The first kids of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, were already victims of free will and Satan with the one brother murdering his other brother in cold blood. Any version of Earth will end up with human suffering, simply because any person has the free will to commit such an evil act will definitely do so to further their own agenda. That is how free will works. The existence of violence does not preclude the existence of a God, in fact it is more than likely that the existence of free will supports the theory of this life only being a test.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yes, in a perfect utopian world that would be the ideal case. However, due to the existence of the Devil who has dominion over the earth and can corrupt humans as he pleases, the hatred and violence is a direct result of his influence and is not Gods wish. I&#39;m sure it can be argued that God is somewhat sadistic for allowing this to happen when he has the power to stop it, but I guess this plays into the theory of life on this earth being a test from God, with those who lived by his commands and resisted the temptations of Satan making it into heaven with all the rewards you could think of for your worldly sacrifices.  </p>

<p>And if God doesn&#39;t exist, it is simply the psychopaths of the world who are perpretating violence and misery on the people of the earth for their own material gain. That is their free will to choose. They are horrible human beings with no empathy for others, who would anything in their power to further their own personal interests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen how risk averse these cowards are and assure you that individually they are easy to scare, have nearly zero tolerance for pain, and would do just about anything, including treason, to avoid responsibility for their individual decisions. True story.</p>

<p>So one of the problems, among many, of the ideas of an eternal reward or punishment, is that there is zero chance the punishment could ever be commensurate with their crimes, aka a painful hell.</p>

<p>Because again I assure you, the beings perpetrating this callous hatred and violence here in this place would never ever in a million years be able to withstand even the slightest amount of physical pain.</p>

<p>So.. do I believe in a reward? Not really, no, is it possible, sure, but I do not live my own life with any expectation of heaven.</p>

<p>In fact, if heaven involves any form of returning to Earth or reincarnation under the coexistence of Jesus, then no, I will openly reject that heaven to God himself.</p>

<p>If God does not have a good explanation for why three year old little children are stabbed to death on their birthdays, or good children are kidnapped and human trafficked by Jesus, (seems to be the only real will of Jesus) then again, I will openly reject all forms of heaven and choose fade to black.</p>

<p>No force in existence will voluntarily get me to step back into the light of Earth while Jesus is allowed to exist and shit on everything.</p>

A few got caught in some shady businesses which they weren’t transparent about. There’s been the odd drug dealer in the south iirc. But nothing really mind blowing or shocking.

<p>You choose to assume this politician was gang raped by Muslims in an attack planned by one of her former city council colleagues (of the same anti Muslim party ffs).

    <div class="md"><p>You said that she was a &quot;councilor of one of the world&#39;s most renowned cities and center of international justice&quot;, but you forgot to mention that she was an outspoken &quot;anti-immigrant&quot; politician.</p>

<p>How did she know a &quot;group of Muslims&quot; raped her? Many African and Arab immigrants to Europe are Christian or irreligious. She claimed they raped her to scare her into keeping &quot;quiet in the Hague city council&quot;. </p>

<p>She said she was afraid for her life and the lives of her children so she didn&#39;t go to the police, but then she decided a year later to talk about it on Facebook and then two days later she was found dead of an apparent suicide. </p>

<p>Are you suggesting that a group of &quot;Muslim immigrants&quot; saw her Facebook video iand immediately located her and perfectly pulled off a staged suicide because of some vague claims she made? It&#39;s not like she identified them by name, or provided photographic or DNA evidence. Why would anyone feel threatened and feel the need to kill her over that?</p>

<p>Maybe she was raped, or maybe she merely claimed to be to give credence to her anti-immigrant, anti-Islam rhetoric, but, as someone who continuously scrutinizes mainstream narratives, I just find it hard to believe that some immigrants from third-world countries somehow managed to &quot;suicide&quot; this woman like professional hitmen without leaving behind any evidence or doing anything that might tip off investigators. I also find it hard to believe that a woman who hates Muslims would be ABDUCTED AND RAPED AND LET GO and not go to the police but keep it to herself for a year and then talk about it on Facebook Live. I mean, she was living and breathing to justify her stance that immigrants should not be allowed into her country, so...wouldn&#39;t that be something she could use to say, &quot;See! Look what they did to me! They are too dangerous to be here! Do you see what I&#39;ve been saying?!?!?&quot; But, instead, she did not report it to the authorities who could have totally had police guarding her house at all hours, protecting her and her family? How does a politician get kidnapped and raped and no one notices? How does a woman get gangraped and not tell anyone for a year? How does someone, who is not a professional hitman but rather a refugee from a war-ravaged third-world country, get into her house and stage her suicide?</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible that she was raped, and it is also possible that the woman was completely unhinged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I realize that, and I think it is absurd. Most people won&#39;t be able to come to terms with this, but it&#39;s the God&#39;s honest truth:</p>

<p><strong>if a woman is raped and doesn&#39;t report it simply because she doesn&#39;t think she will be believed or because she is afraid of what people will say, she becomes complicit in allowing a rapist to rape again.</strong></p>

<p>If I witness a murder, I&#39;m not going to keep it to myself because I&#39;m afraid no one will believe me or that I might get killed for talking. This is called having principles. Being victimized and not reporting it helps the perpetrator commit more crimes.</p>

<p>Same thing with women with children who stay in abusive relationships. I sympathize with a woman who is beaten black-and-blue and fears for her life, but when she lets that fear or threat of social stigma prevent her from getting law enforcement involved, she is partially responsible for her children living in terror.</p>

<p>Two wrongs don&#39;t make a right. If you are beaten or raped, it doesn&#39;t become an excuse to conceal the identity of a criminal, thereby helping them go on to do it again and again. These women need to understand that what happened to them was terrible, but failing to report it is also terrible. As I said before, God forbid I was ever raped, I would not do the rapist a solid by failing to report it to the appropriate authorities. Easier said than done, perhaps, but it must be done, and there is literally no excuse great enough to justify not doing it. I know that&#39;s a tough pill to swallow for most people, but it is the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This lady suggested in 2016 that muslims should be exeterminated with nuclear bombs.</p>

<p>She was being investigated on a fraud case, by the mayor, the man who she attacked in her suicide video. </p>

<p>She never reported the rape, she went to work the next day. All on tape. </p>

<p>She doesn&#39;t show any emotion recalling the rape event, but cries at the end when she slips up and says she can&#39;t go on and is ending it. </p>

<p>No conspiracy. She was a racist with mental issues who felt the pressure when she was being investigated for fraud. Yells &quot;It&#39;s the muslims&quot; ones more and ends it. </p>

<p>What a hateful way to go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since when did ISIS become the beacons of truth and the representation of what a Muslim should be? They do so may things that are completely forbidden in Islam. They are rejected by all Muslims worldwide. They are less that 0.05% of the total Muslim population on earth (and that&#39;s a very high estimate). They have absolutely no authority on what Islamic teachings are or should be. Stop treating them as gospel. You are literally falling for their brainwashing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yes, in a perfect utopian world that would be the ideal case. However, due to the existence of the Devil who has dominion over the earth and can corrupt humans as he pleases, the hatred and violence is a direct result of his influence and is not Gods wish. I&#39;m sure it can be argued that God is somewhat sadistic for allowing this to happen when he has the power to stop it, but I guess this plays into the theory of life on this earth being a test from God, with those who lived by his commands and resisted the temptations of Satan making it into heaven with all the rewards you could think of for your worldly sacrifices.  </p>

<p>And if God doesn&#39;t exist, it is simply the psychopaths of the world who are perpretating violence and misery on the people of the earth for their own material gain. That is their free will to choose. They are horrible human beings with no empathy for others, who would anything in their power to further their own personal interests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So now we pass judgement based on what they &quot;could have been?&quot; That&#39;s great.  </p>

<p>Even if they were ISIL followers, you should judge them as ISIL terrorists then and not as Muslims, because what they are doing is completely forbidden by the religion they supposedly follow. Demonizing the entire religion for something that is actually forbidden by said religion is beyond ridiculous.</p>
