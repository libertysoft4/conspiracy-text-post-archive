I don&#39;t own any personal weapons because I don&#39;t currently have time to hunt. I understand both arguments for guns, and against guns. The only reason I currently believe it is good for citizens right to own weapons is to keep government in check... Attempting to control the population in a police state would be very difficult considering the vast private ownership. Conspiracy thinking? Maybe? That aside if no civilians were allowed to own weapons there would be less injury and death by gun violence. I don&#39;t trust the government to not take advantage of that situation. Those of you against civilian access to guns... how do you think your vision would actually play out?</p>

<p>The question here is how far should it go? The consitution says the right to bear arms shall not be infringed PERIOD. </p>

<p>If the idea is to be able to mount a resistance to a hostile state then should we allow citizens to own a weapon which can shoot down a drone? What about artillery or mechanized vehicles? </p>

<p>Can I own a nuke to dissuade foreign powers to fuck off with MAD?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My two cents about the Constitutional issue of owning nukes or grenades or fighter jets...</p>

<p>The Constitution, at the time it was written, gave people the right to “bear arms,” which was interpreted at the time to mean only weapons a person could hold (i.e. rifles, not large cannons), and arms was used to mean guns, not explosives (which did exist at the time). </p>

<p>So an originalist view of the Constitution concludes nuclear weapons, bombs, grenades etc... can be banned because they are not “arms” as understood when the Constitution was ratified, and weapons that cannot be carried by a person, like an F35 fighter jet, can be banned because a single human cannot “bear” (carry) a jet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Under that logic, we’d get no 1st Amendment Rights on the Internet (or any other new information technology developed after the Constitution), abortion is not a Constitutional right,  and the police should be able to use X-Ray machines or any other new technology to look into our homes or arrest us based on spying on private emails we sent without getting a warrant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s a very good and fair question. If it’s some sort of missile launch system that tracks planes, then it would be fine to ban that under my Constitutional analysis. </p>

<p>But if it’s some large caliber round(s) that can take down a plane, under my previous logic, that seems unconstitutional. It also seems crazy to let people own that sort of thing... </p>

<p>Congress and the states could pass an amendment to the Constitution specifically banning anti-aircraft guns (and other guns/weapons they want to ban). That’d be my solution to the issue. </p>

<p>I also wonder if 3d printing or some other technologies are gonna come along that makes all sorts of incredibly deadly weaponry easy to obtain and affordable. Technology might outpace what legislatures, government and police enforcement can do to stop crazy people from obtaining really scary stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believe it or not, the military has done studies on this very topic.  </p>

<p>IIRC, the order from most likely to join the citizen to most likely to shoot the citizens was:  All special forces, Marine rank &amp; file, Army rank &amp; file, Navy enlisted, AF enlisted, Air Force officer, Navy officer.</p>

<p>This made sense to me at the time, the Navy Intelligence was the forefather or the CIA and connected to black ops and the secret space program.  They seem... removed from society.</p>

<p>The special forces was the most interesting.  Super trained, super effective, zero tolerance for shooting Americans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re only chance of survival is an assault rifle or maybe an extended clip pistol. You can agree with that?</p>

<p>Another scenario being left out is the BLM riots in America. When they burnt cars and businesses, they didn&#39;t do it with guns. They used fire. How do we outlaw fire? </p>

<p>The only protection against MOB RULE is guns.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more like 1 in 10 chance. But that&#39;s cool. Call it nonsense all you want. That&#39;s what anti-gun right advocaters usually do when they&#39;re confronted with real questions they can&#39;t answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The argument I&#39;ve seen is that if there are fewer guns in circulation, there will be fewer guns available to criminals. The only reason criminals have such easy access to guns now is because there are so many guns out there in the first place. There are a lot of flaws with this argument and it would take years of buybacks and confiscations to have any noticeable effect.  </p>

<p>And just to be clear I&#39;m not endorsing this, I&#39;m just letting you know what the usual argument is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What nobody ever thinks about is Mexico; guns are illegal there, and in fact they get most of their illegal weapons from us. However, assuming the 2nd can actually be abolished, and that somehow all guns can be confiscated (they can&#39;t), that just opens up a huge, huge market for the cartels. Pretty sure drugs are illegal in Mexico too, but they have no problem producing and transporting them to the US, they&#39;d do the same with guns as soon as the demand is there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. The demand is already there, and even if you melted down every single gun in America that will never go away. They&#39;d either be smuggled in from Mexico or built in backyard machine shops. Just take a look at some of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pass_copy?wprov=sfla1">Khyber Pass guns</a> to see what can be made with some very rudimentary tools. </p>
