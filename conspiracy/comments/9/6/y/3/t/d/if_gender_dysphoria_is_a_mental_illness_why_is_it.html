psychological therapy?</p>

<p>Is the whole trans movement a way to make money and permanent patients for plastic surgeons?</p>

<p>Since gender is a binary based off of sex is is easy to adapt biological differences to sociological ones.</p>

<p>As far as I know they need to keep up the hormone therapy for the rest of their days, otherwise issues that arise. But thats not a treatment, it doesnt eventually make them a man/woman. </p>

<p>To be honest, I think you need to work on your comprehension skills a little. </p>

<p>You&#39;re so blinded by your own ideology, you cant even see when someone is in general agreement with you. My one area of opposition would be that I dont think its my business if a grown adult wants to transition to the opposite sex.</p>

<p>But this seems to be a problem with your discussions in general, your responses are emotionally led, which blinds you to anything that diverges from your own thought process. </p>

<p>If they are born into a gender they can&#39;t be socialized by social constructs into that gender. So if they are born into a gender, as you fucking said, it can&#39;t be a social construct. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it?  </p>

<p>The reason I pointed that out is to show that the claim you made has absurd implications.  I did not ever make a conscious choice nor did the extreme majority of people.  </p>

<p>In fact, the only people who give it any thought are the few that are non-conforming.  I don’t mean that to say they are wrong, just to illustrate that the argument the two of you were having was false from both sides.  </p>

<p>Credit is a social construct completely:  before society invented it, it did not exist at all in an undefined sense.</p>

<p>Gender is not, unless we are just splitting hairs over the exact definition.  Even without labels or consideration it exists.  The social construct part is merely to make definitions for what we observed.  </p>

<p>Gender is as much of a social construct as <em>seasons</em> are.  Think of fall, winter, summer, spring, the things that come to mind for each have socially defined concepts <em>but</em> those are all based on observed reality based on nature.  Plants will bloom in spring and will produce fruits in fall and lose their foliage in winter regardless of what we label them as.</p>

<p>To me none of that carries any real moral directive.  But if your goal is to advocate for trans people, arguing about the definition of gender vs sex is a pointless hill to die on because the person you are arguing with <em>can</em> point to objective facts and be correct as well.  This is because gender <em>was colloquially adapted to mean sex in the 1400’s</em> and was used as a synonym entirely until very recently beyond fringe counter-culture types in the 1960’s.  So gender meaning only sex <em>is</em> the valid definition historically, the activists have tried to change the meaning, this is also true.  But it isn’t an argument that can be won.  </p>

<p>Better solution would be to just make a <em>new</em> word instead of trying to force people to accept the definition that some <em>want</em> it to be.  (And for many it is even <em>worse</em> because they argue as if it is ignorant to think gender=sex when they, themselves, are the ones ignorant of the history of the word.)</p>

<p>That doesnt in anyway imply that I think gender is fluid.</p>

<p>And despite everything else I&#39;ve said that suggests that I dont think gender is a social construct, despite the fact that I said it was a disassociation from their gender (and not some sort of change of gender), you still didnt think to just quickly clarify what I meant with that phrase?

<p>You accept that it&#39;s a mental illness, but you want to encourage it? Why?</p>

<p>Do you work for a plastic surgeon?</p>

<p>Are the negative effects of surgery like this something you expect universal health care to pay for? Because I&#39;m not okay with paying for elective surgery.</p>

<p>Im not sure how you came to the conclusion I want to encourage it. Allowing something is very different than encouragement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sex refers to your biological makeup. Male and female refer to your sex. It&#39;s determined by your chromosomes, sexual organs, etc. </p>

<p>Gender refers to the role society assigned to you (e.g. man/woman) and the associated expectations (masculinity/femininity)</p>

<p>Gender isn&#39;t inborn, because it refers to the role society categorizes you in. Your gender isn&#39;t even fixed and can change if you move a culture that has a different way of assigning gender roles.</p>

<p>&quot;gender identity&quot; refers to the innate sense of which gender you belong to. Your gender identy is inborn and is based on the sex of your brain.</p>

<p>Transgender people report that they feel like the opposite sex, because their innate gender identity doesn&#39;t align with their sex.</p>

<p>We lefties always say &quot;gender is a social construct&quot; because we want to highlight that the labels &quot;man&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; don&#39;t have to be based on your assigned sex just because we in the western world did it this way for a couple thousand years.</p>

<p>If we base it on the sex of their brain instead it&#39;s a categorization that&#39;s just as valid, but that makes more sense (because the brain tells you more about a person than their chromosomes) and that&#39;s better (because transgender people have regular rates of mental illnesses and suicide rate if they can live as their preferred gender).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sex and gender are synonymous if you only look at the traditional western world, but not every culture is based on Christianity.</p>

<p>Sex refers to your biological makeup. Your sex is a biological fact. </p>

<p>Gender refers to your role in society and the associated expectations. Gender is a social construct, meaning that different cultures have different ways of deciding who&#39;s a man or a woman (or even a third gender). </p>

<p>There are plenty of cultures that base gender on performance or identity and that even have more than two genders. </p>

<p>In other cultures there doesn&#39;t exist the idea that every male is a man and that every male is straight. This idea is based on the idea that it would be blasphemy to go against the plan of the Christian God, but plenty of other cultures accept that biology is more complex than two simple boxes.</p>

<p>For example would you think it&#39;s gay if a transgender woman sleeps with a man (both were born male)? Probably yes, right? Well even in Iran - where homosexuality is punishable by death - this isn&#39;t considered to be homosexuality because they consider post-op transgender women to be actual women based on their religious beliefs. (because transgender woman have already existed during the time of Muhammad and they even described sex change surgery (or the Great Circumcision) in detail)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really should work on posting complete thoughts in a single post - it makes replying soooo much easier for everyone.</p>

<p>&quot;Gender roles are usually centered on conceptions of femininity and masculinity,[2] although there are exceptions and variations. The specifics regarding these gendered expectations may vary substantially among cultures, while other characteristics may be common throughout a range of cultures. There is ongoing debate as to what extent gender roles and their variations are biologically determined, and to what extent they are socially constructed.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Social constructs can be activities or expectations of a specific sex, yes. I do not have an answer as to why culture operates in a specific way - I don&#39;t know if anybody does. I would argue that infusion of Christianity has had a profound impact on western gender roles.

<p>And no, I wouldn&#39;t claim that gender roles are a thing of the past. They&#39;re more discussed these days and there&#39;s more allowance of variance from those roles, but they certainly do still exist. </p>

<p>AKA you have nothing of worth to contribute to a discussion you yourself created in an attempt to stir up drama. When confronted with actual information that disproves or objects to your underdeveloped, immature perspective on gender, rather than &quot;learn&quot; as you claimed you were trying to do, you resort to ad hominem attacks and claims of &quot;triggering&quot; as if this is 4chan. In the real world, with adults and stuff, that shit doesn&#39;t fly. </p>

<p>It is really funny how you mention brainwashing when you yourself can&#39;t really explain or defend your position other than to say &quot;Being transgender isn&#39;t a thing&quot;. You have no justification or evidence for your belief other than the whole &quot;transgender&quot; thing makes you feel icky and uncomfortable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol that&#39;s so far off from the actual incidence rate I honestly feel sorry for you. Why are you reactive against normal chromosomal human variation?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some medical stats you could have found with a minute of searching:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.who.int/genomics/gender/en/index1.html">From the WHO page on Gender and Genetics</a></li>
</ol>

<p>One interesting bit from here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aneuploidy is the condition of having less than (monosomy) or more than (polysomy) the normal diploid number of chromosomes. Aneuploidy occurs in at least 5% of all pregnancies and is the most commonly recognized chromosome abnormality in humans. (16) Divergence from the normal number of X and Y chromosomes, called sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA), accounts for approximately half of all chromosomal anomalies in humans with a <strong>total frequency of 1:400</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the same source:</p>

<ul>
<li>XYY  Males -- 1:1000</li>
<li>XXX Females -- 1:1000</li>
<li>Turner syndrome (monosomy X chromosomal) -- 1:3000</li>
<li>Klinefelter syndrom (male phenotype, XXY / XY&amp;XXY chromosomal expression) -- 1:600 males</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency">From the ISNA, which I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll reject as a source, but anyway</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12476264">From Pubmed, in an article that tries to debunk the 1.7% rate myth as too high</a></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Relevant bit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the term intersex is to retain any meaning, the term should be restricted to those conditions in which chromosomal sex is inconsistent with phenotypic sex, or in which the phenotype is not classifiable as either male or female. Applying this more precise definition, the true prevalence of intersex is seen to be about 0.018%, almost 100 times lower than Fausto-Sterling s estimate of 1.7%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s <strong>18:1000</strong> births, not counting Turner syndrome or Klinefelter (or others like them), that express some scientifically valid intersex condition by chromosomal variation. </p>

<p><strong>18 out of every 1000 babies expresses a phenotypic sex (i.e. their genitalia) that doesn&#39;t match their chromosomal sex.</strong></p>

<p>Let that sink in. </p>

<p>If gender is a matter of chromosomes, then there sure is a lot of non-binary variation in gender, by your definition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Move goalposts much? What happened to one in a billion? </p>

<p>As for your question about trans people -- I only chimed in on this discussion because you said gender is binary and that chromosomes determine gender. </p>

<p>Clearly chromosomal variation among humans is (1) not reflective of the binary absolutism you profess and (2) clearly more common than the one in a billion figure you pulled out of your ass.</p>

<p>To me, 18/1000 is significant, but even that number doesn&#39;t account for the full range of chromosomal variation that occurs without resulting in a disjunct between phenotypic expression and chromosomal sex.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>let&#39;s completely change our culture and society to let the[m] feel accepted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Literally no one is talking about this as far as I can tell. But why do you think this is the case? </p>

<p>And would it really hurt if we helped these folks feel loved? Is your life, specifically, somehow worse off because of these issues?</p>

<p>One last thing to consider: only 2 or 3 out of 1000 babies are born deaf. But every TV and streaming device has closed captioning as an option. We have literally changed society for these 2 or 3 out of 1000. Is this an unfair accommodation by your standards?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not a fact though. They aren&#39;t one in the Bible belt, but they can be one in other cultures.</p>

<p>Even if they were at the same place, but in a time before the European settlers came they would be a woman. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So how is that not a lie..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s say we are both 18, but in my culture adulthood is based on being 18 and older, but in yours it&#39;s based on being 21 and older.</p>

<p>Would I be lying if I told you that I am an adult? No I wouldn&#39;t, because in my culture I would be an adult. It simply wouldn&#39;t matter to me at all if I wouldn&#39;t be an adult in your culture. You would be lying if you claimed that I&#39;m not an adult because I&#39;m not 21.</p>

<p>Adulthood is a social construct. There&#39;s no universally true guideline that states how a society should label people as adults. Biology merely provides us the fact that we undergo puberty and reach maturity, but it doesn&#39;t tell us where to draw the line.</p>

<p>Similarly gender is also a social construct. Biology merely provides us sexual dimorphism, but it doesn&#39;t tell us where to draw the line and how to categorize people.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no reason why chromosomes should be the defining factor for gender, especially because it&#39;s not intuitive. You can&#39;t directly perceive someone&#39;s chromosomes, but you can perceive which gender role they adhere to.</p>

<p>Like if you brought <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Buckangel_cowboy.JPG/220px-Buckangel_cowboy.JPG">this person</a> along to meet your parents they wouldn&#39;t care if he has a vagina. They would ask you to introduce your boyfriend.</p>

<p>Then you haven&#39;t read anything from credible sources. That&#39;s a common, but evidently wrong misinterpretation that&#39;s floating around on right wing fake news sites.</p>

<p>One of the commonly cited resources is <a href="http://www.sexchangeregret.com/research">http://www.sexchangeregret.com/research</a></p>

<p>But if you take a look at their sources it becomes evident that they are deliberately lying about the findings of their sources </p>

<p>Their first source:</p>

<ul>
<li>SWEDISH STUDY</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>A long-term study of 324 sex-reassigned persons in 2003 in Sweden concluded:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Persons with transsexualism, after sex reassignment, have considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidal behaviour, and psychiatric morbidity [diseased state] than the general population. Our findings suggest that sex reassignment, although alleviating gender dysphoria, may not suffice as treatment for transsexualism. (Read the entire study here)&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are thousands of others like me, who underwent the surgery only to discover that it did not help. The only results from the surgery were some cosmetic changes.</p>

<p>It might be easy to dismiss my opinions as just one man’s story, but I&#39;ve done extensive research into what the experts say. You can read the results in Paper Genders. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay so now let&#39;s break it down.</p>

<p>First: this study doesn&#39;t say that it didn&#39;t help. It says that it did alleviate gender dysphoria.</p>

<p>Secondly: it&#39;s often used as proof that it increases their rates, but it doesn&#39;t say that either.</p>

<p>Thirdly: even the author herself made public statements calling out these &quot;ridiculous misinterpretations&quot;.</p>

<p>In reality regret is very rare and usually caused by outdated procedures, bad doctors or an unwelcoming environment afterwards.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what actual research says:</p>

<p>Bauer, et al., 2015: <a href="http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2">http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Transition vastly reduces risks of suicide attempts, and the farther along in transition someone is the lower that risk gets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moody, et al., 2013: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722435">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722435</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The ability to transition, along with family and social acceptance, are the largest factors reducing suicide risk among trans people.</strong></p>

<p>Young Adult Psychological Outcome After Puberty Suppression and Gender Reassignment: <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958">http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A clinical protocol of a multidisciplinary team with mental health professionals, physicians, and surgeons, including puberty suppression, followed by cross-sex hormones and gender reassignment surgery, provides trans youth the opportunity to develop into well-functioning young adults. All showed significant improvement in their psychological health, and they had notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously reported among trans children living as their natal sex. <strong>Well-being was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population.</strong></p>

<p>The only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The scholarly literature makes clear that gender transition is effective in treating gender dysphoria and can significantly improve the well-being of transgender individuals.</p>

<p>Among the positive outcomes of gender transition and related medical treatments for transgender individuals are improved quality of life, greater relationship satisfaction, higher self-esteem and confidence, and reductions in anxiety, depression, suicidality, and substance use.</p>

<p>The positive impact of gender transition on transgender well-being has grown considerably in recent years, as both surgical techniques and social support have improved.</p>

<p><strong>Regrets following gender transition are extremely rare and have become even rarer as both surgical techniques and social support have improved. Pooling data from numerous studies demonstrates a regret rate ranging from .3 percent to 3.8 percent. Regrets are most likely to result from a lack of social support after transition or poor surgical outcomes using older techniques.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>These anecdotes are few and flimsy, and those who stir up fears of regret have no excuse for relying on them so heavily. Rigorous studies on transition outcomes and regrets have been available for years. In a 2003 study of 232 trans women who had received genital reconstruction from the same surgeon, none were consistently regretful, and 6% felt regret sometimes. Eight respondents were regretful because of inadequate surgical outcomes, five were regretful because of social and family issues, and two occasionally returned to living as men on a temporary basis. This pattern is consistent with the personal accounts we’ve seen citing social difficulties or shortcomings of transition treatment.</p>

<p>Another study in 2005 found that out of 162 trans adults, only one reported that she would choose not to transition again, and another had some regrets but would choose to transition again. Five participants only felt regrets during treatment, and did not want to return to living as their assigned gender.</p>

<p>A study in 2006 similarly found that out of 62 trans people who had undergone surgery, one woman said she occasionally regretted it, and continued to live as a woman. And in 2009, a study of 50 trans women who had received genital reconstruction found that only two felt regret sometimes. It’s no surprise that Walt Heyer has to reach so far to find so few cases of regret: all of the available research on the subject indicates that this is extremely uncommon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As for the brain studies:</p>

<p><em>&quot;The question is not simply whether there are differences between the brains of transgender individuals and people identifying with the gender corresponding to their biological sex, but whether gender identity is a fixed, innate, and biological trait, even when it does not correspond to biological sex, or whether environmental or psychological causes contribute to the development of a sense of gender identity in such cases”... &quot;There are no serial, longitudinal, or prospective studies looking at the brains of cross-gender identifying children who develop to later identify as transgender adults.”</em></p>

<p>No one is contesting that the fact that gender identity disorder/gender dysphoria is a legitimate psychological condition. The question is whether it is innate, fixed and part of human diversity or whether it is environmentally-derived, can change, and should be diagnosed as treated as a mental illness.
There are identifyible markers in the brain scans of people with other mental disorders as well, like schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and bipolar disorders...but just because there are objective signs indicating the condition doesn’t mean it is healthy (“normal”) functioning for that individual.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>...the majority of patients with gender dysphoria had at least one psychiatric Axis I comorbidity, the most common being major depressive disorder (33.7%), specific phobia (20.5%), and adjustment disorder (15.7%) [a].</em>
<strong><em>Gender “dysphoria” is a diagnosis of depression. Yet being identified as a transsexual or diagnosed with gender dysphoria often stands in the way of getting a proper diagnosis of the comorbid or underlying psychopathologies.</em></strong> <em>...With a diagnosis of gender dysphoria they are encouraged to undergo sex transition as treatment</em>....<strong><em>The coexisting psychiatric disorders should be treated first before undergoing irreversible, life-changing sex change surgeries.</em></strong>
<em>Depression and Axis 1 disorders can be treated properly with psychiatric medication in conjunction with effective talk therapy...</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And also—</p>

<p><em>“prior to the widespread promotion of transition affirmation, 75 to 95 percent of pre-pubertal children eventually outgrew that distress. The vast majority came to accept their biological sex by late adolescence after passing naturally through puberty. ...</em> <strong><em>Put plainly, transgender identification is something that most often corrects itself.</em></strong> </p>

<p>You don&#39;t take a person with dissociative identity disorder and tell them to embrace all their personalities, do you?  </p>

<p>To say this is an occult ritual is naive and disparages the people who suffer with society encouraging them to embrace an illness that brings them grief.  I mean, how many people who have gender dysphoria want to feel that way?  And if you can treat it without invasive procedures, that&#39;s kind of what medical doctors are supposed to do.  Treat with the best interest of the patient in mind.  So if you can deal with how you feel with talk therapy, who thinks it&#39;s a good idea to mutilate someone&#39;s genitals and pump them full of medications that prevent reproduction?</p>

<p>Transitioning is the recommended treatment because it&#39;s the best way to get rid of gender dysphoria. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not comparable. Your example is like comparing being gay to dissociative identity disorder. Just because they aren&#39;t typical doesn&#39;t mean that they are crazy. </p>

<p>Humans can have male or female brains. That&#39;s normal. If one has a brain that has the wrong sex for their body it&#39;s possible to lead a normal healthy life if they can transition, just like gay people can lead a normal healthy life if we let them come out of the closet. </p>

<p>We tried that. We also tried to pray the gay away, but it simply doesn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>Surgery is the least invasive method and also one that works best. If you let them transition in an accepting environment their mental health is similar to that of cisgender people. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not anything like comparing homosexuality to DID.  Homosexuality isn&#39;t an illness.  Gender dysphoria is.  Transvesticism isn&#39;t an illness, it&#39;s a preference.  But gender dysphoria is an illness. </p>

<p>Maybe you&#39;ve tried talk therapy, but there seem to be a lot of parents eager to change their child&#39;s gender, virtue signaling the whole way there.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t compare what I&#39;ve said to &quot;pray the gay away.&quot;  That&#39;s a bullshit comparison.  </p>

<p>Surgery is by definition the most invasive and most risky to the health of the individual.  Working through talk therapy to help change one&#39;s perspective on how they feel about the body they have does more than just prevent unnecessary surgery, it also teaches one how to cope with other difficult situations.  A young adult can&#39;t possibly know if they&#39;re about to do something that can&#39;t be reversed.  </p>

<p>By the medical community at large. The APA agrees and that should be enough. </p>

<p>And gender dysphoria can be healed of they can transition in an accepting environment. They aren&#39;t considered to be mentally ill if they lead a normal healthy life post-OP. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why young transgender adults do not get surgery right away. They get put on hormone blockers until they can decide which puberty they want to go through.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right?  All those generations of humans raising children who may or may not have conformed to gender norms of the time and place just let their kids be.  And guess what?  They didn&#39;t have gender dysphoria until post-modernism came along and society started telling kids they could be anything they wanted.  Before that, the child might grow up to be a well-adjusted gay person or a closeted transvestive (history is replete with secret transvestites who were heroes in their own right).  But now, if little Johnny decides one day he wants to wear his sisters clothes, he must have gender dysphoria.  He was born in the wrong body and mommy and daddy need to give him hormone suppression treatments, which, ironically, means he will never have offspring of his own.  Convenient way to weed out the undesirables while parading the virtues of #bornthisway.   </p>

<p>Let a kid do what he wants.  But be certain, your decisions are probably not what your child would choose for themselves given the facts and the capacity to understand the long-term consequences of those actions (specifically drugging a child so they can more easily transition later when they might otherwise grow out of it).</p>

<p>History was much more accepting of transgender people until Christianity spread across the globe.</p>

<p>Many Native American tribes had non-binary genders, and would naturally address transgender people with a name and pronouns that were in line with how they identified. </p>

<p>Even today in super conservative places like Iran or India it&#39;s easier for transgender people choose their gender freely than in the Bible belt.</p>

<p>In Iran homosexuality is punishable by death, but transgender women sleeping with cisgender men is legally and religiously allowed, because even in the time of Muhammad &quot;mukhannathun&quot; were considered to be <em>women in truth</em> if they underwent the &quot;great circumcision&quot;. The state even takes most of the cost and they have the second highest number of surgeries world wide. </p>

<p>Transgender people have always existed, but it only became harmful when the story of the Garden of Eden made people believe that transitioning is unnatural and blasphemy.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t have gender dysphoria until the Old Testament came along and society started telling kids they could not be the gender that aligns with their natural innate gender identity. </p>

<p>Which highly influenced the Christian parts.</p>

<p>Sure the Jewish gender system is quite similar (because it&#39;s also based on the book of genesis) in the sense that transitioning is seen as blasphemy, but it&#39;s not as binary.</p>

<p>In the Jewish version of the Book of Genesis Eve created from Adam&#39;s rib, they both were one being that split apart into male and female. Androgynous people had to adhere to laws that affect both sexes, but the idea that they have to be one sex came up in early Christian Rome.</p>

<p>So yes you are right it&#39;s more specifically based on Jewish religious beliefs, but the western gender system is still based on a Christian form of those beliefs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s easier if we start with this fact: gender dysphoria isn&#39;t unique to transgender people. People who have undergone a forced sex change experience the exact same symptoms.</p>

<p>Imagine you were born as a male, but were given a sex change at birth and were raised as a girl. As soon as you can talk you start to utter the wish to be called a boy and that you don&#39;t want to wear dresses. Your parents tell you that you have a vagina and therefore are a girl. This goes on all your life and despite you feeling like a man inside, everyone insists on using female pronouns and treating you like a woman. This obviously makes you depressed and mentally ill. </p>

<p>What do you think would help you more, going through therapy until you accept that you are a woman or being able to live as a man? </p>

<p>Well we&#39;ve been there and done that. We sometimes gave males that were born with a micropenis a sex change at birth because the doctors thought that <em>a man with a small penis can find no acceptable place in society.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropenis">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropenis</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the 1960s until the late 1970s, it was common for sex reassignment and surgery to be recommended. This was especially likely if evidence suggested that response to additional testosterone and pubertal testosterone would be poor. With parental acceptance, the boy would be reassigned and renamed as a girl, and surgery performed to remove the testes and construct an artificial vagina.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those poor souls developed gender dysphoria, because their innate gender identity didn&#39;t align with their body and role in society. </p>

<p>And well it&#39;s the same with transgender people. It doesn&#39;t matter if you got a forced sex change or if you were born with the wrong brain, in the end it&#39;s your innate gender identity that governs if you want to be a man or a woman, but not the sex you were assigned at birth.</p>

<p>And well transgender people evidently have a brain who&#39;s sex aligns with that they claim to be feeling:</p>

<p><a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2016/gender-lines-science-transgender-identity/">http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2016/gender-lines-science-transgender-identity/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Transgender women tend to have brain structures that resemble cisgender women, rather than cisgender men. Two sexually dimorphic (differing between men and women) areas of the brain are often compared between men and women. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalus (BSTc) and sexually dimorphic nucleus of transgender women are more similar to those of cisgender woman than to those of cisgender men, suggesting that the general brain structure of these women is in keeping with their gender identity.</p>

<p>In 1995 and 2000, two independent teams of researchers decided to examine a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc) in trans- and cisgender men and women (Figure 2). The BSTc functions in anxiety, but is, on average, twice as large and twice as densely populated with cells in men compared to women. <strong>This sexual dimorphism is pretty robust, and though scientists don’t know why it exists, it appears to be a good marker of a “male” vs. “female” brain.</strong> Thus, these two studies sought to examine the brains of transgender individuals to figure out if their brains better resembled their assigned or chosen sex.</p>

<p>Interestingly, both teams discovered that male-to-female transgender women had a BSTc more closely resembling that of cisgender women than men in both size and cell density, and that female-to-male transgender men had BSTcs resembling cisgender men. These differences remained even after the scientists took into account the fact that many transgender men and women in their study were taking estrogen and testosterone during their transition by including cisgender men and women who were also on hormones not corresponding to their assigned biological sex (for a variety of medical reasons). These findings have since been confirmed and corroborated in other studies and other regions of the brain, including a region of the brain called the sexually dimorphic nucleus (Figure 2) that is believed to affect sexual behavior in animals.</p>

<p>It has been conclusively shown that hormone treatment can vastly affect the structure and composition of the brain; thus, several teams sought to characterize the brains of transgender men and women who had not yet undergone hormone treatment. <strong>Several studies confirmed previous findings, showing once more that transgender people appear to be born with brains more similar to gender with which they identify, rather than the one to which they were assigned.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Transgender people have a brain that was made for the wrong sex and it&#39;s just massively easier to adapt their body to fit to their brain than to change their whole brain.</p>

<p>You could try to force them to be cis if you gave them enough medicine and electrical shocks, but all that damage would leave them basically mentally retarded. On the other hand a sex change surgery is much less invasive and has been shown to drastically reduce their suicide rates and to dramatically improve their mental health. </p>

<p>So if a chemist talks about trans-isomers and cis-isomers are they being hateful? Or if they talk about transfats and cisfats? Is it hateful if I talk about places that are transatlantic and those that are cisatlantic?</p>

<p>Just because you never had any kind of higher education doesn&#39;t mean that normal terms are hateful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right?  All those generations of humans raising children who may or may not have conformed to gender norms of the time and place just let their kids be.  And guess what?  They didn&#39;t have gender dysphoria until post-modernism came along and society started telling kids they could be anything they wanted.  Before that, the child might grow up to be a well-adjusted gay person or a closeted transvestive (history is replete with secret transvestites who were heroes in their own right).  But now, if little Johnny decides one day he wants to wear his sisters clothes, he must have gender dysphoria.  He was born in the wrong body and mommy and daddy need to give him hormone suppression treatments, which, ironically, means he will never have offspring of his own.  Convenient way to weed out the undesirables while parading the virtues of #bornthisway.   </p>

<p>Let a kid do what he wants.  But be certain, your decisions are probably not what your child would choose for themselves given the facts and the capacity to understand the long-term consequences of those actions (specifically drugging a child so they can more easily transition later when they might otherwise grow out of it).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Move goalposts much? What happened to one in a billion? </p>

<p>As for your question about trans people -- I only chimed in on this discussion because you said gender is binary and that chromosomes determine gender. </p>

<p>Clearly chromosomal variation among humans is (1) not reflective of the binary absolutism you profess and (2) clearly more common than the one in a billion figure you pulled out of your ass.</p>

<p>To me, 18/1000 is significant, but even that number doesn&#39;t account for the full range of chromosomal variation that occurs without resulting in a disjunct between phenotypic expression and chromosomal sex.</p>

<p>And would it really hurt if we helped these folks feel loved? Is your life, specifically, somehow worse off because of these issues?</p>

<p>One last thing to consider: only 2 or 3 out of 1000 babies are born deaf. But every TV and streaming device has closed captioning as an option. We have literally changed society for these 2 or 3 out of 1000. Is this an unfair accommodation by your standards?</p>
