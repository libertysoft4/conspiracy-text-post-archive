        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Everyone&#39;s got a lot to say abut the Alex Jones/Infowars news. A lot of people are defending these companies. Here is Johnstone&#39;s recent article &quot;In A Corporatist System Of Government, Corporate Censorship Is State Censorship&quot; <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2018/08/10/in-a-corporatist-system-of-government-corporate-censorship-is-state-censorship/">https://consortiumnews.com/2018/08/10/in-a-corporatist-system-of-government-corporate-censorship-is-state-censorship/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last year, representatives of Facebook, Twitter, and Google were instructed on the US Senate floor that it is their responsibility to “quell information rebellions” and adopt a “mission statement” expressing their commitment to “prevent the fomenting of discord.”</p>

<p>“Civil wars don’t start with gunshots, they start with words,” the representatives were told. “America’s war with itself has already begun. We all must act now on the social media battlefield to quell information rebellions that can quickly lead to violent confrontations and easily transform us into the Divided States of America.”</p>

<p>Yes, this really happened.</p>

<p>Today Twitter has silenced three important anti-war voices on its platform: it has suspended Daniel McAdams, the executive director of the Ron Paul Institute, suspended Scott Horton of the Scott Horton Show, and completely removed the account of prominent Antiwar.com writer Peter Van Buren.</p>

<p>I’m about to talk about the censorship of Alex Jones and Infowars now, so let me get the “blah blah I don’t like Alex Jones” thing out of the way so that my social media notifications aren’t inundated with people saying “Caitlin didn’t say the ‘blah blah I don’t like Alex Jones’ thing!” I shouldn’t have to, because this isn’t actually about Alex Jones, but here it is:</p>

<p>I don’t like Alex Jones. He’s made millions saying the things disgruntled right-wingers want to hear instead of telling the truth; he throws in disinfo with his info, which is the same as lying all the time. He’s made countless false predictions and his sudden sycophantic support for a US president has helped lull the populist right into complacency when they should be holding Trump to his non-interventionist campaign pledges, making him even more worthless than he was prior to 2016.</p>

<p>But this isn’t about defending Alex Jones. He just happens to be the thinnest edge of the wedge.</p>

<p>Infowars has been censored from Facebook, Youtube (which is part of Google), Apple, Spotify, and now even Pinterest, all within hours of each other. This happens to have occurred at the same time Infowars was circulating a petition with tens of thousands of signatures calling on President Trump to pardon WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Julian Assange, who poses a much greater threat to establishment narratives than Alex Jones ever has. Assange’s mother also reports that this mass removal of Infowars’ audience occurred less than 48 hours after she was approached to do an interview by an Infowars producer.</p>

<p>In a corporatist system of government, wherein there is no meaningful separation between corporate power and state power, corporate censorship is state censorship. Because legalized bribery in the form of corporate lobbying and campaign donations has given wealthy Americans the ability to control the U.S. government’s policy and behavior while ordinary Americans have no effective influence whatsoever, the U.S. unquestionably has a corporatist system of government. Large, influential corporations are inseparable from the state, so their use of censorship is inseparable from state censorship.</p>

<p>This is especially true of the vast mega-corporations of Silicon Valley, whose extensive ties to U.S. intelligence agencies are well-documented. Once you’re assisting with the construction of the US military’s drone program, receiving grants from the CIA and NSA for mass surveillance, or having your site’s content regulated by NATO’s propaganda arm, you don’t get to pretend you’re a private, independent corporation that is separate from government power. It is possible in the current system to have a normal business worth a few million dollars, but if you want to get to billions of dollars in wealth control in a system where money translates directly to political power, you need to work with existing power structures like the CIA and the Pentagon, or else they’ll work with your competitors instead of you</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Censorship Through Private Proxy</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And yet every time I point to the dangers of a few Silicon Valley plutocrats controlling all new media political discourse with an iron fist, Democratic Party loyalists all turn into a bunch of hardline free market Ayn Rands. “It’s not censorship!” they exclaim. “It’s a private company and can do whatever it wants with its property!”</p>

<p>They do this because they know their mainstream, plutocrat-friendly “centrist” views will never be censored. Everyone else is on the chopping block, however. Leftist sites have already had their views slashed by a manipulation of Google’s algorithms, and it won’t be long before movements like BDS and Antifa and skeptics of the establishment Syria and Russia narratives can be made to face mass de-platforming on the same exact pretext as Infowars.</p>

<p>This is a setup. Hit the soft target so your oligarch-friendly censorship doesn’t look like what it is, then once you’ve manufactured consent, go on to shut down the rest of dissenting media bit by bit.</p>

<p>Don’t believe that’s the plan? Let’s ask sitting US Senator Chris Murphy: “Infowars is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies that uses sites like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart,” Murphy tweeted in response to the news. “These companies must do more than take down one website. The survival of our democracy depends on it.”</p>

<p>That sure sounds an awful lot like the warnings issued to the Silicon Valley representatives on the Senate floor at the beginning of this article, no? This is headed somewhere dark.</p>

<p>We’re going to have to find a way to keep the oligarchs from having their cake and eating it too. Either (A) corporations are indeed private organizations separate from the government, in which case the people need to get money out of politics and government agencies out of Silicon Valley so they can start acting like it, and insist that their owners can’t be dragged out on to the Senate floor and instructed on what they can and can’t do with their business, or (B) these new media platforms get treated like the government agencies they function as, and the people get all the First Amendment protection that comes with it. Right now the social engineers are double-dipping in a way that will eventually give the alliance of corporate plutocrats and secretive government agencies the ability to fully control the public’s access to ideas and information.</p>

<p>If they accomplish that, it’s game over for humanity. Any hope of the public empowering itself over the will of a few sociopathic, ecocidal, omnicidal oligarchs will have been successfully quashed. We are playing for all the chips right now. We have to fight this. We have no choice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats how game companies used to handle things. They said just report and move on if theyre being disruptive enough the number of reports kicks it to a support team who will issue temp bans.</p>

<p>Now games like rocket league and rainbow 6 seige have it so if someone says a word thats on &quot;the list&quot; they get bans automatically regardless of context. Just matches the words </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both games have it secret. </p>

<p>On one it starts with a 3 strike chat ban then moves to full bans like 24 hours a week then permanent. </p>

<p>Rainbow 6 has a more gradual escalation with the first like 8 I believe. </p>

<p>They can purchase a new license yes there isnt any punishments beyond permanently banning the license itself. So to play again you have to buy it again. Even worse was they had to change the name of an ability called black mirror because Spanish speakers were getting banned for saying negro and then whatever the word is for mirror. </p>

<p>Rather than realizing their flaws and reverting the system they literally changed the name of an ability. </p>

Because I have news for you, control will not go to the elected officials who we possibly factor in their decision making at least a little.

<p>Nor do I expect it to. Did you read my post? My position is that we need to start using, developing, and promoting alternatives that are decentralized from the get go. These alternatives exist and more are being made as we speak. </p>

<p>No one has any loyalty to FaceBook or ThemTube or any other platform (including Reddit); they use them because all their friends are there, or they think the people they want to influence are there. Once real alternatives are mature enough for grandmas to use, and enough of a critical mass starts shifting to them, the rest of the population will follow. </p>

<p>Until then, I&#39;ll use platforms like reddit to try to shift people in that direction. I&#39;m certainly not expecting FB to just give up its centralized cash cow, nor waiting for the government to swoop in and &quot;fix things.&quot;</p>

<p>I had myspace for a while, then got facebook also cause it was new and for a time I had both until a clear better product emerged and the other just seemed to be crap.  I thought for sure that trend would continue and facebook would be outta here by now.  It just doesnt seem to want to go away.  Likely due to its inorganic beginnings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotcha. Sorry for the misread. </p>

<p>Yeah, FB seems to have hit its stride at the right time and just developed a market share that&#39;s been impenetrable. When newcomers like Instagram came along, FB just gobbled them up. Its integration with the US IC certainly helped. </p>

<p>Reddit isn&#39;t any better in terms of their connections and ambitions; their moderation model just allows for more real discussion, if you have the time and inclination to look for it. Vanilla reddit (and even this sub to my dismay) is getting more and more gamed and botted the fuck out.  I suspect that will continue to worsen as well. </p>

<p>We still have a window to move away from the centralized, for-profit model, though I do worry that window is closing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess a term I just made up? ;) Sure someone else has used it. </p>

<p>Basically I mean the (formerly) default subs, the stuff that hits r/popular and r/all, and any sub over about 100k subscribers. We can&#39;t trust the vote scores, and even many of the comments are inorganic, either in content or upvotes. </p>

<p>Real conversation still exists in smaller and niche subs, the underground of a formerly underground site. Real content still exists on reddit, and occasionally breaks through the various filters, but as a whole the site is controlled. </p>

<p>I had myspace for a while, then got facebook also cause it was new and for a time I had both until a clear better product emerged and the other just seemed to be crap.  I thought for sure that trend would continue and facebook would be outta here by now.  It just doesnt seem to want to go away.  Likely due to its inorganic beginnings.</p>
