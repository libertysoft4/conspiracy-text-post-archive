I truly don&#39;t understand how this sub, of all subs, doesn&#39;t see the unchecked path toward authoritarianism he seeks and is leading the nation to. He&#39;s not a typical politician, but he is an establishmet puppet who only desires greater power and self-enrichment. He says he will drain the swamp, and does the opposite. He says he supports the working people, and does the opposite. He says he wants to end the war, and increases the military budget by over $100 billion. He literally calls any negative press, however truthful and provable, &quot;fake news&quot;. He promotes a culture of violence, and literally calls Nazis good people.  </p>

<p>He lied to our faces and has broken all of his campaign promises thus far. How do so many people, IN THIS SUB, not see the conspiracy before us?</p>

<p>I find it best to sit back and watch social engineering in action on those threads... keep my strength for the ones that interest me on a proper conspiratorial level. </p>
