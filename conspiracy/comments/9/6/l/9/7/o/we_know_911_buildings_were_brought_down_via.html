    <div class="md"><p>9/11 was a mass blood magick ritual. It was heightened by the sheer scope of the spectacle- millions across the West, and the world, watched. It shifted the historical trajectory of the West, establishing the world as we know it today. It ushered in the Patriot Act, the security state, and the overt Western presence in the ME.</p>

<p>These are just some of the reasons behind 9/11. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few rocks? Lmao that&#39;s what you think the debris from the towers was? No the towers didn&#39;t neatly fall into their own footprint without debris falling outside it.   </p>

<p>Yes, jet fuel and burning debris caused fires in wtc7. I can&#39;t believe this is even debated. The idea that people could wire up these buildings for a controlled demolition without anyone noticing, including the fire fighters who went into these buildings and survived is so idiotic that it isn&#39;t in the realms of possibility. </p>

<p>I heard it was a worldwide money laundering operation involving the saudis. </p>

<p>If wtc7 doesn&#39;t sell you look into the magic plane that hit the Pentagon. </p>

<p>So you say that jet fuel from a plane that hit a building across the street in its 87th  floor somehow travelled down 50 floors, across the street and into the infrastructure of wtc7 only catching fire at that point and burning it down?</p>

<p>And you&#39;re on a conspiracy sub with that bullshit?</p>
