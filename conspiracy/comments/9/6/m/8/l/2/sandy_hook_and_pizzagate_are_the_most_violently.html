    <div class="md"><p>Why, pray tell, are the other planets round? </p>

<p>Why, when I was in the Navy were radar calculations of distance objects on the horizon (that dropped off radar when they passed over the horizon) accurate when accounting for height of radar antenna? </p>

<p>I mean I personally watched a ship disappear from view while it was still on radar, then watch it disappear from radar the calculated distance farther than from the height of the flight deck. But in radar school we could watch planes flying to O’hare (but not land) that were farther away, but because they were higher in the sky, we could still see them. </p>

<p>Also, what is the motive gained by all the scientists denying the flat earth? What is the root reason they all keep telling lies? </p>

<p>The scientists have families and jobs, and they get paid to research things. Who&#39;s paying for the flat earth research? </p>

<p>The root reason is knowledge is power, and those in power do not want you to have certain knowledges. There is this thing called the occult, it&#39;s all about hiding the truth. </p>

<p>Flat earth is tied in with religion a lot because the Bible and ancient beliefs were FE and without Big Bang cosmology and science fiction stuff your left with a creationism or some kind of intelligent design. </p>

<p>There is no mediating particle for gravity and if it was curvature of space time then the WMAP would not have measured the universe as flat. Not to mention dark energy and dark matter had to be inserted haphazardly into the model because it&#39;s completely broken lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. Go try it. Clearly you haven’t. It’s pretty obvious they are all spherical. Actually technically oblate spheroid.

    <div class="md"><p>No link, no. If a few centuries or more of science doesn’t convince you, I’m not wasting my time sending a link. </p>

<p>Have you ever heard of snipers using the Coriolis effect figure in their shooting calculation? It takes into account shooting direction and the earth’s rotation and accounts for the that travel during the flight time of the bullet. Shooting east and shooting west and varying degrees of those, have different values. I don’t know the math, but if earth was flat, how would they not be missing their targets if this was all fraudulent because the earth isn’t actually round? </p>

<p>Of course I have heard of the Coriolis effect, it&#39;s a myth that asserts the earth rotates underneath objects in flight. So if you jumped up and down you should travel sideways as the earth rotates under you right?

    <div class="md"><p>Hundreds of millions was a rough underestimate based on a figure of roughly 20% of people work in science fields. 20% of 7 billion is 1.4 Billion. Extrapolate over a few hundred years and it’s an even rougher rough number but close enough. I’ve never heard of a single scientist that believed in flat earth so few hundred million was pretty low. But if you consider that support roles in science fields would also have to keep the secrets, it’s even lower. So no, I didn’t research the number in detail, which is why I undershot. Even if I was half wrong, that’s still a fuckton of people to silence. </p>

<p>Aside from science, what about all the pilots and flight attendants? How have none of them leaked? I’ve heard the claim that the windows on the plane are the reason you the earth looks curved from a plane, but why does that effect not occur on the ground? Why does it appear greater at high altitude than low altitude? </p>

<p>I’m not going to google shit for you. The Coriolis effect isn’t “on the object in flight”, it’s the effect of the earth moving concurrently with an object moving in space.  </p>

<p>If you want to prove flat earth, get a telephoto lens and take a picture of Mount Everest. It’s the tallest point on earth so if it’s flat, you should be able to see it from anywhere with a telescope right?  Or go to Michigan and take a picture of the beach in Chicago from across the lake. Note, you can actually see the sears tower from Michigan but only because it’s tall enough to see over the curvature of the earth.  But you can’t see the beach except in certain atmospheric conditions, (I think it’s called mirage). </p>

<p>There are just way too many things that flat-earth theories just cannot answer but yet high school level science class can. </p>

<p>And why do flat-earthers always seem to show up in controversial conspiracy threads like Sandy Hook shit? Just seems you are plants to make people that don’t toe the official story line, to look like morons. </p>

<p>Cool story bro. If you are legit, seriously, apply your skepticism to real science. Learn your “enemy”. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are going to tell me there are 1.4 Billion scientists in good faith? You just damage your own point with that. </p>

<p>From your own source that you linked earlier, you can&#39;t see the curvature from ~30k feet up that commercial airliners fly at. You&#39;re just throwing stuff out there, at least the very least use fact based arguments. </p>

<p>So what is the measurable, reproducible effect from the earth moving concurrently with an object moving in space? How much does it displace a bullet every time? I&#39;ll answer for you, it doesn&#39;t and there isn&#39;t one. </p>

<p>No I already explained in my previous comment, there is an atmosphere (or should I say atmoPLANE) that refracts light and restricts your ability to see infinite ranges. You&#39;re referring to a superior mirage I think, but the world record long distance photo took advantage of an atmospheric effect called looming.</p>

<p>Flat earth theories explanations are often flawed, I totally agree with you. But if you can&#39;t admit the ball earth theories have their own flaws then you are just being dogmatic and unscientific, and if you research science then you would know there is always a competing and viable theory and it&#39;s a continual process. Sometimes that process involves proving a prevailing theory false, which almost invariably happens eventually. </p>

<p>I am applying my skepticism to real science. I have learned a lot since embarking on my flat earth research, and the journey isn&#39;t over. Flat earth is just like any other conspiracy, it has it&#39;s disinfo agents and subversion, but it&#39;s also been around since the dawn of time and not brewed up recently. The chinese thought the earth was flat until Jesuit priests gained favor in the Imperial courts, they must be morons right? Or maybe ball earth is a meme and philosophy that doesn&#39;t really make much sense after you stop suspending your disbelief. </p>

<p>Round earth isn’t dogma... it’s fact that’s been proven for centuries. There are no “flaws in round earth theories” there are flaws in my debating, because I’m gobsmacked anyone can be so confident in their ignorance of science. Lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, what you’re saying is you don’t grasp how an arc around a sphere is a shorter distance? That’s just kinda simple math. </p>

<p>But further you don’t seem to grasp the implications of how many people would have to be “in” on the conspiracy of just air travel. Every international flight path would have to be a lie, flight distances, plane speeds all faked. Are pilots in on the deception or is the instrumentation faked? Do air traffic controllers fake flight paths? 
What about aircraft mechanics and avionics technicians? Are they falsifying calibration of sensors that monitor flight data, speed and distance? What about GPS? Is there some central authority that all this collaboration goes through? Which government(s) are funding it?  </p>

<p>So, all the scientists, astronomers, pilots, stewardesses, avionics technicians, aircraft mechanics and manufacturers, manufacturers of all mapping/navigation hardware and software. How the fuck do satellites even stay in orbit of a flat earth? Do you deny gravity too? </p>

<p>Look up the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. The top of towers of the Verrazano - Narrows Bridge at the mouth of the Hudson river in New York City are tilted almost two inches further apart than the base thanks to the curve of the Earth&#39;s surface.</p>

<p>Don’t believe it? Fine, you just prove your ignorance. Or stupidity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah man the stewardesses and the aircraft mechanics are in it, where do you get this nonsense lol? </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to go full retard in trying to prove me wrong. </p>

<p>The routes flights take consider many variables like wind currents and staying within minimum distances to emergency landing locations. And the routes vary per flight. The typical flat earth counter and response would be there are no flights that do directly over the south pole or Antarctica even when it would be shorter because it&#39;s impossible on the flat earth map. </p>

<p>I understand it&#39;s hard to comprehend, and it&#39;s a jarring concept. But yes, the government lies and things are much different than the story you learn in school or they show on the television and movie screens. </p>

<p>I&#39;m aware of all the typical stuff like the bridge example, it&#39;s one of the first things you&#39;ll come across when googling or watching some youtube debunk videos. If a bridge being two inches farther apart at the top then the bottom proves the earth is a ball to you then it doesn&#39;t take much. </p>

<p>Yes. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The most important nature of optics is that light travels in a straight line. This is also what gives us day and night at different times for different countries. You can&#39;t just put the sun over one part of a flat surface and think is can be dark on another part, because light travels until something stops it. </p>

<p>If you think the US government is behind hiding the flat earth, you seriously don&#39;t know our history because civilisations have been able to work out the round shape of the earth since about 6BC, thousands of years before the US government even existed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First 5 minutes: explaining how unfair it is that people can&#39;t visit Antarctica without permission, along with an explanation of how he would need to traverse the entire 5500 km lengths of Antarctica below the 60th parallel to prove that it forms the edge of the world (this doesn&#39;t even make sense, if it forms the edge you can literally just traverse south across it. Why would you need to sail around the entire length?) </p>

<p>5-10 min: Penguin jokes. (seriously if you cut out all the random filler shit this video might be watchable) Claims that the Antarctic Treaty must be a conspiracy because no one cared about the environment when it was signed in 1959. Calls moon landing fake (of course he does). Claims antarctica has vast military resources that should have been exploited by everyone from North Korea to the USSR. Claims the flag of Antarctic having its shape is incredibly suspicious, because they&#39;re trying to brainwash people into believe that the shape is real. Presumably he would prefer if the Flag of Antarctica was pure white. Claims its harder to go to Antarctica than into a military base. (I really can&#39;t keep up with the bullshit in this video. He literally shows clips of people in Antarctica after saying this)</p>

<p>10-15 min: You need to fill out a form to go to Antarctica because its treated as a &quot;giant natural reserve&quot;. This...you know what I give up. I can&#39;t rewatch this video. You win, the world is flat</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post/link, but I’m not so sure they purposely left the bait. I mean, since day one they were very explicit that any posting on social media contradicting the official narrative would be investigated and prosecuted. And you can see in many staged events after SHES, that they tried to up their game to make the events more believable, i.e blood/gore, which SHES lacked and was called out for not having any. In the end, I don’t think they’re all that concerned about exposure. They control all the media that the masses pay attention to and can always control the narrative, even when social media blows up with a piece of evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that the people who actually have dead family members from Sandy Hook know what happened and the conspiracy theorists are calling them liars and some were even threatening them because they don&#39;t believe anybody died.  Look at it from their point of view.  Assume that their children really were shot and killed.  Do you want people saying you were paid by the government to pretend your 4 year old was murdered and that you are just an actor and that your child wasn&#39;t actually killed and you&#39;re just a piece of shit scumbag trying to help the government take everyone&#39;s guns away?

<p>he houses that were signed over on christmas day (which i skimmed over, didnt look into in detail)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve actually researched the house thing. The common date and prices ($0) entered for the houses were the result of a new real estate sale tracking system being installed, and the date was just the default for any property that wasn&#39;t manually entered/updated, and the price was defaulted to $0 for any property that wasn&#39;t sold after the system was set up. They hadn&#39;t entered any historical (past years) data into the system. Every house with other values had dates after the software upgrade.</p>

<p>In every case of &quot;suspicious&quot; numbers the actual deeds are older than the system itself. So there was nothing fishy looking here once you look into it - they just set up new software and those were the default values.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This..... I have been actively researching conspiracies since the web was created and the highest levels of censorship are certainly around Sandy Hook and a few others. SO MANY pages, videos, blogs, all just absolutely gone now.</p>

<p>I remember right after Sandy Hook a few people I know tried to just get into Newton in the weeks after the event and were literally getting turned around on the roads in by police illegally stopping them and obstructing them from  even going to Newton.</p>

<p>One friend said the only similar type thing was the BP oil spill in the Gulf. Corpoate goons were bossing the Coast Guard, State Troopers and media around about even filming public beaches or even driving into towns. CBS News was even told to stop filming down there on the beach once by the Coast Guard under direct instruction from BP on their damn boat.</p>

<p>Sandy Hook is one of the most bizzare and strange conspiracies I have ever seen. Everything about it is totally unique to any other school shooting. </p>

<p>We go from the compulsory acceptance of the &quot;unreality&quot; of the explanation for that event to being compelled to accept the official explanation for whatever, if anything, took place at Sandy Hook with no reliable or conclusive evidence to actually prove anything at all about it.</p>

<p>Considering that&#39;s the nature of what we&#39;re up against given that those are crimes against the public at large that powerful interests both inside and outside of the government are both complicit in trying to hide the truth about, it only stands to reason that same methodology is going to be applied to other crimes that they more than anyone else have worked their way into a position to both commit and get away with it. Essentially exonerating themselves and compelling their lies to be accepted and without any avenues to publicly challenge them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, I’ve mentioned before that that’s the only thing I don’t really get.</p>

<p>The official story is <em>possible</em>, but it kinda depends on a bit of a final destination-esque chain of failures.</p>

<p>Which is possible, just... unlikely.</p>

<p>I don’t necessarily believe it, but.. the tower attack could have been authentic and used as an excuse to demolish building 7 in the chaos. The old magician trick of large movements hiding the small slights.</p>

<p>If we knew it was going to happen and when, it wouldn’t be a stretch to coordinate a ‘slight’ to happen at the same time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be, but my feeling is that the building caught fire from wreckage and knowing they couldn’t put it out decided to blow it instead.</p>

<p>NYC has a <em>lot</em> of close buildings. Water pressure was already low because of active firefighting at other locations, and 7 was low priority all things considered. If it was already evacuated, blowing it would have been the easiest way to prevent the fire from spreading to the other surrounding buildings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Building 7 was part of the deal the planners struck with Silverstein. The building was an asbestos filled dog that he had been planning to replace since before April 2000 when he received the designs for the new and improved building 7 from the architects he&#39;d hired.</p>

<p>I believe the planners knew of Silverstein&#39;s intentions, and told him they would level his building (for free) in a fake terror attack so he could build his new tower with the insurance money--all he had to do was buy the lease on the rest if the complex and, as new owner, help them get access the building cores to plant the charges.</p>

<p>If everything had gone according to plan , then WTC7 would have gone down at the same time as WTC1 (immediately following the first plane impact) as though falling debris &quot;took it out&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That involves entirely too many connections to work. More likely the building had a self destruct to prevent city damage. A fire broke out from falling wreckage <em>as in the report</em>, and the self destruct was used both as an opportunity and to prevent other close buildings from catching fire. The fire hydrant water pressure was already low from the WTC suppression, and it was going to burn regardless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s amusing how Sandy Hook is so obviously fake that they’ve basically thrown it to the dogs. It’s a sacrificial pawn to them: cognitively impaired people for some reason think that the fake shootings just stopped after Sandy Hook for some reason, and continue to be fooled by these endless fake shootings. </p>

<p>Now, whenever another one occurs you see people here saying something like “Sandy Hook was a false flag but this one is <em>definitely</em> real, people <em>definitely</em> died.” Look out for this. It’s part of their tactic. Concede Sandy Hook so you can gatekeep the other fake shootings more believably. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It goes beyond just censoring conspiracies. It&#39;s the media trying to control people&#39;s reality. The media is like an abusive psychedelic drug that people are addicted to, and anyone that questions their bad shows immediately gets silenced. The fake shootings are bad enough, wait until people realize the media spreads fake race bait stories to stir up racial hatred.

    <div class="md"><p>The 1963 coup in which President Kennedy was murdered is the move violently censored IMO. It&#39;s the big bad open &quot;secret&quot; they protect decade after decade, because it discredits our entire government and way of life and exposes it all as a fairy tale. </p>

<p>Hell, the reason &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; is a weaponized term is because of the coup. </p>

<p>The CIA promoted the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; smear in the 1967 CIA Document 1035-960 entitled &quot;Countering Criticism of the Warren Report,&quot; as a propaganda device for their media “assets” to use against the many people who rightly recognized the Warren Report, claiming a lone nut murdered President Kennedy, as a huge steaming pile.</p>

<p>Media shills got the memo from their CIA overlords, and have obediently parroted it ever since.</p>

<p>Use of the term &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is a proven conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, I’ve mentioned before that that’s the only thing I don’t really get.</p>

<p>The official story is <em>possible</em>, but it kinda depends on a bit of a final destination-esque chain of failures.</p>

<p>Which is possible, just... unlikely.</p>

<p>I don’t necessarily believe it, but.. the tower attack could have been authentic and used as an excuse to demolish building 7 in the chaos. The old magician trick of large movements hiding the small slights.</p>

<p>If we knew it was going to happen and when, it wouldn’t be a stretch to coordinate a ‘slight’ to happen at the same time.</p>

<p>Again, I don’t <em>believe</em> that, but I’m willing to entertain the <em>possibility</em></p>
