    <div class="md"><p>I saw a YouTube video where Michael claimed he was almost out of his contract with Sony (said he owed them one more album) and that when he was out of it he would own Sony Music&#39;s distribution. The clip was from shortly before his death (within a month IIRC). Either way, it&#39;s pretty obvious he had upset some powerful (read: extremely wealthy) people and the circumstances surrounding his death were suspicious to say the least. His life was a sad one and  even though he affected millions of lives positively through music, he is still mainly remembered/accused of being a pedo. I&#39;m on the fence about that particular accusation and uncertain of whether it was truth or slander by TPTB. He was certainly troubled mentally which made the accusations easy to believe but I&#39;d say very few know the truth in this situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So to clarify the particulars of Jackson’s stake here: Jackson owned 50% of Sony/ATV publishing collective prior to their acquisition of EMI.  They were the second largest publishing rights owner at the time and its kind of an amazing story...</p>

<p>Jackson purchased ATV in 85 from an Australian corporate raider for around 50m when ATV had about 750,000 songs from a number of great artists they had acquired or merged over the years.  </p>

<p>One of these acts, was in fact, the Beatles.  They were smart from the start with everything but personnel.  An early manager and publisher got tied into Northern Songs, a company they formed in to protect their copyrights.  When  Epstein (their manager) passed away, Dick James (their publisher) organized to sell off enough of the company in 1969 to leave them open for an ownership shift.  Paul and John tried to fight it off and failed, losing their rights to their own music soon after becoming the globetrotting super starts we now associate them as.  ATV now owned the catalog of the most revered band on the planet...</p>

<p>Rumors flew about Jackson actually being a ghost buyer for McCartney, and though they had previously been friends and collaborators, none of that held true; Michael just knew it was a shrewd business move and he had been inspired by many of the artists owned by the publishing catalog.  Plus if you had the money, wouldn’t you want to “own” the Beatles?  He also could do more with the library than a go-go 80s corporate crasher who just wanted the parent company so he paid a pretty penny for them without looking back. A big investment bat the height of his career, but it would become his true legacy and payout more than any number of years touring ever could.</p>

<p>In the late 80s Sony had recently decided to venture into publishing.  They bought up CBS’s library but needed copyrights for larger acts that in the 60/70s all created their own labels.  Many of these eventually had been acquired under the ATV publishing umbrella including NS (Beatles).</p>

<p>His rights at ATV, plus others he had acquired, were to some of the most valuable and well selected publishing properties of all time so when Sony offered to merge the companies in 95, just ten years after his purchase for 50m not only did he receive a 100m payout he also kept 50% of the rights to the now largest publishing group on the planet.  Interestingly, Jackson managed to shield his own copyrights from this merger having them under his own company umbrella that was managed by Sony, but owned 100% by himself and his estate. But without ATV, Sony would have been a weak 3rd tier contender.  The deal was sealed and kickstarted the company to the global movie/music/production group we know today and Jackson had a seat at the table and veto power to all of Sony Musics decisions for the next ten years.  </p>

<p>Sony continued to purchase labels and catalogs, both current and defunct leading into the 21st century and the omnipresence of digital music rights, and by 2006 had gained operational control from Jackson. He still had a say but it was no longer a full 50% (though the details are generally obscured).  Jackson agreed to a clause allowing Sony to buy out half of his stake for $250m at any given time, secure in his position at Sony and the relationships he built there as the largest private shareholder in the conglomerate.</p>

<p>Michael soon passed and his estate retained the value in Sony/ATV but with the collective purchased of the publishing rights of EMI in 2011 for a little over $2B the estates ownership of now Sony/ATV(/EMI) was assessed at 10%.  Granted, this is a company who owned publishing to 4m songs and garnered 1.2B per year and they were now the largest on the planet.  None of it would have been possible without Michael’s foresight and early publishing investments.</p>

<p>In 2015 some “clause” was triggered in the contract between Sony and the Jackson Estate.  One could buy out the other or renegotiate but Michaels estate had accrued around 250m in debt since his passing that needed to be paid.  Sony worked with them, however, negotiating a payout of 750m and still leaving them a stake until last month (literally, July 2018) when the remainder was purchased from the family for 287m.  </p>

<p>Speculation is that the family wanted $1B plus “you pay for the legal fees” for what was left of Jackson’s control in the company.</p>

<p>Pretty awesome story really; I’ve worked around the music industry for 20 years and it still amazes me how few people know Michael was also the greatest publishing rights buyer broker of all time (outside the business that is)</p>

<p>Why do you think THIS could have been the tour where he did this? He&#39;d been on world tours lots of times before, and certainly had a huge number of concerts since writing/releasing They Don&#39;t Really Care About Us. What makes you think anything would have been different in this world tour?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So to clarify the particulars of Jackson’s stake here: Jackson owned 50% of Sony/ATV publishing collective prior to their acquisition of EMI.  They were the second largest publishing rights owner at the time and its kind of an amazing story...</p>

<p>Jackson purchased ATV in 85 from an Australian corporate raider for around 50m when ATV had about 750,000 songs from a number of great artists they had acquired or merged over the years.  </p>

<p>One of these acts, was in fact, the Beatles.  They were smart from the start with everything but personnel.  An early manager and publisher got tied into Northern Songs, a company they formed in to protect their copyrights.  When  Epstein (their manager) passed away, Dick James (their publisher) organized to sell off enough of the company in 1969 to leave them open for an ownership shift.  Paul and John tried to fight it off and failed, losing their rights to their own music soon after becoming the globetrotting super starts we now associate them as.  ATV now owned the catalog of the most revered band on the planet...</p>

<p>Rumors flew about Jackson actually being a ghost buyer for McCartney, and though they had previously been friends and collaborators, none of that held true; Michael just knew it was a shrewd business move and he had been inspired by many of the artists owned by the publishing catalog.  Plus if you had the money, wouldn’t you want to “own” the Beatles?  He also could do more with the library than a go-go 80s corporate crasher who just wanted the parent company so he paid a pretty penny for them without looking back. A big investment bat the height of his career, but it would become his true legacy and payout more than any number of years touring ever could.</p>

<p>In the late 80s Sony had recently decided to venture into publishing.  They bought up CBS’s library but needed copyrights for larger acts that in the 60/70s all created their own labels.  Many of these eventually had been acquired under the ATV publishing umbrella including NS (Beatles).</p>

<p>His rights at ATV, plus others he had acquired, were to some of the most valuable and well selected publishing properties of all time so when Sony offered to merge the companies in 95, just ten years after his purchase for 50m not only did he receive a 100m payout he also kept 50% of the rights to the now largest publishing group on the planet.  Interestingly, Jackson managed to shield his own copyrights from this merger having them under his own company umbrella that was managed by Sony, but owned 100% by himself and his estate. But without ATV, Sony would have been a weak 3rd tier contender.  The deal was sealed and kickstarted the company to the global movie/music/production group we know today and Jackson had a seat at the table and veto power to all of Sony Musics decisions for the next ten years.  </p>

<p>Sony continued to purchase labels and catalogs, both current and defunct leading into the 21st century and the omnipresence of digital music rights, and by 2006 had gained operational control from Jackson. He still had a say but it was no longer a full 50% (though the details are generally obscured).  Jackson agreed to a clause allowing Sony to buy out half of his stake for $250m at any given time, secure in his position at Sony and the relationships he built there as the largest private shareholder in the conglomerate.</p>

<p>Michael soon passed and his estate retained the value in Sony/ATV but with the collective purchased of the publishing rights of EMI in 2011 for a little over $2B the estates ownership of now Sony/ATV(/EMI) was assessed at 10%.  Granted, this is a company who owned publishing to 4m songs and garnered 1.2B per year and they were now the largest on the planet.  None of it would have been possible without Michael’s foresight and early publishing investments.</p>

<p>In 2015 some “clause” was triggered in the contract between Sony and the Jackson Estate.  One could buy out the other or renegotiate but Michaels estate had accrued around 250m in debt since his passing that needed to be paid.  Sony worked with them, however, negotiating a payout of 750m and still leaving them a stake until last month (literally, July 2018) when the remainder was purchased from the family for 287m.  </p>

<p>Speculation is that the family wanted $1B plus “you pay for the legal fees” for what was left of Jackson’s control in the company.</p>

<p>Pretty awesome story really; I’ve worked around the music industry for 20 years and it still amazes me how few people know Michael was also the greatest publishing rights buyer broker of all time (outside the business that is)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did he have debts? Yes.  He may have even leveraged some of his value in the company at times for cash flow, which is probably where a lot of the debt the estate had came from.  But in terms of real value, or net worth his piece of Sony/ATV probably did make him the wealthiest musician of all time.  But it was still gaining value till the day he passed, so it’s kind of hard to pin down the value directly at any given point.</p>
