<p>I&#39;m simply curious as to why all of a sudden, so many major corporate web giants have considered Infowars so controversial that they need to dump them. As far as I was aware, theyve always been controversial. Just curious if any of you lovely yankies are able to give a non bias review of why they may suddenly have been given the boot from so many sites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw a really interesting fringe theory a few days ago, that speculated it was a backstage move for a number of tech companies to distance themselves from incoming investigations/charges concerning Jones relationship with Jerome Corsi and his Q money racket. The speculator wondered if there wasn&#39;t something brewing in the backround that law enforcement was about to go after the major money extraction going on around all the Q donations, youtube channels, merchandise, etc.</p>

<p>I thought it was a very intriguing theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I don&#39;t know. I just thought that the Q/money racket theme seemed very plausible. I do have a spidey feeling that this whole Q cheat is about to blow.</p>

<p>If I were a tech company who was connected to a character who was sponsoring financial fraud (knowingly or not) I be distancing myself from them too.</p>

<p>That said, I like Alex Jones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole thing stems from the coup taking place at the highest level of American politics staged by the GOP and Russia. Russia infiltrated that party slowly since the cold war and now controls them completely. </p>

<p>Media outlets like infowars have been a vital piece in the whole plan the entire time. They&#39;ve been pushing an anti American, pro Russian agenda for the last 20 plus years. So much so that most conservatives don&#39;t even realize they bought it. Don&#39;t trust the American intelligence community, they do bad shit, trust the KGB right? KGB never does anything wrong right? Now go wave your American flag, you stupid dogs, as we use your worst fears and prejudices against you to further our plan. Putin and company are smart motherfuckers man. Talk about the long game. </p>

<p>All you&#39;re seeing right now is the full court press by what&#39;s left of the pro American power structure to regain control. They realized too late what was happening and are trying to get the genie back into the bottle by cleaning up the propaganda. </p>

<p>It&#39;s too late though, it&#39;s over. There will be no blue wave to save America. We are seeing the beginning of the end. Thanks for playing, hope you like vodka. </p>

<p>Just curious why you replied but didn&#39;t answer any questions. Just curious how you&#39;ve come to your absolute knowledge about to whom conspiracy theorists should be listening.  You also seem to have an absolute lock on what conspiracy theorists should believe, and I assume that comes from well reasoned critique of both sides.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read a lot around these here parts, but never come across &#39;limited hangout&#39;.  What do you believe is the meaning of limited hangout and how does it apply to Alex Jones?  What makes Alex Jones more acceptable as a limited hangout rather than Maddow around these here parts?</p>

<p>There are many corporations that provide ad revenue to MSNBC.  Which ones does Maddow shill for, specifically?</p>

<p>Alex Jones&#39;s show doesn&#39;t accept advertising revenue?</p>

<p>Let me tell you something, I&#39;ve watched this unfold since before you had hair on your balls. The GOP has had this in the works for a very long time. America as we know it will be unrecognizable in 20 years. Good luck blaming the liberals for that when they don&#39;t even have to hide the fact that it&#39;s a one party system anymore. </p>

<p>People trust RT over domestic news, Russuan Intelligence over the US Intelligence, what Russia says over the US, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize the authority for domestic propaganda in the NDAA smith mundit act was given to the president, Secretary of State, and CIA Director.</p>

<p>Yet if you look the MSM does not endlessly praise the people legally allowed to control them. Okay Fox News does, but most stay critical.</p>

<p>Likewise, look at the disinformation you have been lead to believe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The CIA runs the MSM, and Obama made it legal for them to feed us propaganda.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A GoP Congress took two years to pass it. Why? Obama was in a Veto war in the first year to prevent this and other riders from passing. He succeded in the first year. Next year the NDAA was sent to his desk and he even wrote an address he condemns it and other riders, but can&#39;t win a veto war where the entire defense funding is on the line.</p>

<p>Now can you answer why you say &quot;Obama made it legal&quot; when he had a long fight against it that he lost. Why don&#39;t you mention the Congressman who wanted it. I&#39;m really curious.</p>

<p>I agree, but my whole thing is I was shot out of a vagina here. In America. I live here so which side am I going to be on?

<p>I agree, there is no stopping globalism and technology is making sure of that. We are already in a global society today which will get more and more consolidated as time goes on. The issue with that is who is going to be in control? I have no problem with a global one world government unless it&#39;s being run by totalitarian psychos, which seems to become more and more likely every day.  </p>

<p>It would make sense that reports on old posts were what got AJ temp banned at YouTube as well.

Everyone who knew infowars was either too young to know any better, too green with conspiracies to know any better or people who used to watch but have moved onto actual conspiracies. If Alex did discuss real conspiracies he made the people who believed in them look stupid and unhinged. Maybe, just maybe he is still controller opposition like we all knew he was before his removal.</p>

<p>One of the children claimed that she was filmed numerous times performing sexual acts with high-ranking federal government officials, in a scheme she said was set up by Cameron and other MKULTRA researchers, to blackmail the officials to ensure further funding for the experiments.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra#cite_note-57">[57]</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was a celebrity photographer, my impression was that the celebrities were somewhat powerless and they appeared to me for the most part drunk or on drugs. I mostly photographed parties. The publicists seemed to have control over the celebrities. The only thing that made sense to me was that the publicists must have copious amounts of blackmail on hand. The environment was so grim and miserable energetically - that’s the theory that made the most sense to me. Napoleon said: “men are moved by two levers: fear and self interest.” I think people can have (rarely) noble motivations but the celebrities seemed controlled through fear to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I mean, Mueller covered up for a decade for [Jeffrey] Epstein kidnapping kids, flying them on sex planes, some kids as young as seven years old reportedly, with big perverts raping them to frame people,&quot; Jones says in the video, referring to billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was convicted of sex crimes after being accused of soliciting multiple teenage girls as young as 13.</p>

<p>&quot;Mueller is a monster, man,&quot; Jones continues in the video. &quot;People say, &#39;Well, God, aren&#39;t you scared of him?&#39; I&#39;m scared of not manning up. I&#39;m constantly in fear that I&#39;m not being a real man, and I&#39;m not doing what it takes, and I&#39;m not telling the truth.&quot;</p>

<p>Jones then pivoted to an analogy where Mueller and he were dueling cowboys, meeting &quot;politically&quot; at high noon for a shootout.</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s a demon I will take down, or I&#39;ll die trying. So that&#39;s it. It&#39;s going to happen, we&#39;re going to walk out in the square, politically, at high noon, and he&#39;s going to find out whether he makes a move man, make the move first, and then it&#39;s going to happen,&quot; Jones said, miming a pistol with his hand.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s not a joke. It&#39;s not a game. It&#39;s the real world. Politically. You&#39;re going to get it, or I&#39;m going to die trying, bitch. Get ready. We&#39;re going to bang heads. We&#39;re going to bang heads.&quot;</p>

<p>And I&#39;ll repeat my often downvoted theory - pizzagate very well may be a distraction from this. There&#39;s very little if any meat on the pizzagate bone. There&#39;s a huge marbleized hunk right here on this one. Reel this one in and if pizzagate is real, it would almost certainly be dragged along as well, given the common players.

    <div class="md"><p>Just what everyone else knows - there were some big names on those flights - Clintons, Trump, Prince Andrew, Kevin Spacey, Alan Dershowitz and who knows who else. Lots of times.  And that Epstein trafficked in underage sex slaves/prostitutes, but inexplicably received a very light sentence despite one of the girls coming forward and providing testimony. </p>

<p>We just learned per that last link why - for being an informant to Mueller. So to get such a great deal, who did he give up? And more importantly, why didn&#39;t Mueller expose the rest of it in the interest of justice? LSS <strong>Who were Epstein&#39;s customers?</strong> It would be extraordinarily easy to compare flight logs with underage girls to those without and see which people were the likely culprits. Or subpoena the pilots. The fact that no major media reporters have ever touched this story in depth, shows me just how thoroughly owned we are.</p>

<p>Some say these are just honeypots to gather compromising info on powerful people for the purposes of blackmail. If the &quot;pee tapes&quot; warranted investigation, this does. Through a few of these setups, it would be fairly easy to amass dirt on enough of Congress or the media to have the world swing your way. In fact, wasn&#39;t that what Binney said? That they have everyone recorded so they already have dirt on most politicians, SC justices and even the president? </p>

It&#39;s right  up the line that he won&#39;t ever be convicted for communicating threats, but it&#39;s clear he&#39;s alluding to threats without specifically clearly making threats.

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder if the recent changes in law were considered. The changes I&#39;m talking about happened several months ago and they made &quot;hosts&quot; of content liable for what the content creators make. It&#39;s the same law that forced craigslist to remove personal ads, for fear that they would be sued for allowing prostitution or sued by survivors of human trafficking or whatever. That would also make all of these outlets that allowed AJ on their service liable for whatever he said.</p>

I figure just enforcing the rules against just one side is probably an astute way to provoke a civil war - if that what’s the oligarchs are really after. It would be a great jump start for them to really go all the way on the martial law they seem so intent on instituting. I think they count on our cowardice since we’ve got numbers on our side.

    <div class="md"><p>Because banning the King of Fringe from media sets a precedent which makes it easier to purge other outlets that offer speculation and discussion outside of the mainstream, including users that share said content, all based on the grounds of safety and combating &quot;hate speech&quot; or &quot;fake news&quot;. This includes Trump, who people have been trying to get banned from Twitter forever.</p>

<p>Social media&#39;s only reason for being is to shape and control the minds of it&#39;s users. In 2016 their great machine didn&#39;t produce the result it was intended to, and now realizing how it could be potentially used against their interests, the globalists are now trying to re-assert their control over it through censorship.</p>

There are links to the Rothchild family funding both sides of WW1 and WW2, among other wars, and its very likely they have as much vested interested in Russia as they do in the Republicans and Democrats.

<p>Also, I still have a TON of questions about Sandy Hook. The fact that they even call attention to someone doubting it is surprising.

    <div class="md"><p>Do the people calling for the killing of Trump get in trouble? YES. weird huh. 
But the part when it&#39;s a big deal, when you call for the death of someone, is when you have a HUGE cult following.</p>

<p>So hence my quote, it was from a king talking about a pope. Sure anyone could say it, but the king said it in front of his loyal guards, and the guards listened. Was it the kings fault for venting near his trusted men, or was it the men&#39;s fault for listening to their king?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to make it seem like Alex is worshipped like a king, but I do think people 100% trust him.</p>

<p>Another over the top, but fits here quote. &quot;I just made sure the trains ran on time.&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;re completely confused.   Alex dumbfuck Jones doesn&#39;t &quot;create conspiracies&quot;.  Conspiracies are perpetrated by conspirators,  meaning that they are created by those guilty of wrongdoing. </p>

<p>Saying that Alex Jones &quot;creates conspiracies&quot; makes it clear that your perspective is one of mainstream (brainwashed) thought, which attempts to imply that those investigating conspiracies are the ones doing wrong. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s get this clear.  Those investigating conspiracies aren&#39;t creating conspiracies...  They are exposing the fucked up agendas and actions of conspirators.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was curious too but I have not been totally convinced by anything I&#39;ve found in this thread, so I figured I&#39;d throw my theory in the ring.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/freshman-infowars-host-keeps-booking-white-nationalists-and-they-sound-just-like-him/">http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/freshman-infowars-host-keeps-booking-white-nationalists-and-they-sound-just-like-him/</a></p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge, Alex Jones has always stuck to the alt lite side of things when it comes to certain issues, counter signaling white nationalism and stuff.  But they got this new guy who has a minor role right now but has been bringing lots of white nationalists on his show.  Unlike Alex Jones, this Jake Lloyd guy hints strongly about the JQ and talks about race realism with regard to politics.  And some comments I&#39;ve read after the fact indicate that people talking about serious red pills were starting to take over the comment sections (we all know how Youtube comment sections can get).  </p>

<p>In short, I think there was a fear that the far right was seeping into the show and its fanbase.  Here you have a show for people who will entertain fringe theories and are completely disconnected from the mainstream -- a perfect target for the alt right to infiltrate with their message.  I wasn&#39;t really an Infowars follower, but this is my perception of what happened.  And I think the recent news about the Sandy Hook lawsuit (about something Alex Jones did or allegedly did <em>years</em> ago) and the media freakout about the Q phenomenon (I don&#39;t even know if Jones was pushing that) was the excuse Big Tech used to purge the conspiracy show.  Maybe counter-signaling Deep State Darling Mueller contributed but I&#39;m pretty sure Alex Jones calls people demons all the time so it&#39;s not like the tech companies thought this was some new crossing of the line. </p>

<p>Answer is: nothing unusual. Everything on Infowars was same as it was for last 20 years: Earth is flat; Democrats puts some shit in the water, to make trumpists stupid ;) so you must buy some miracle pills from Alex Jones to be healthy and happy in this horrible, horrible America, where a half of population is Alex&#39;s personal enemies. But, Russians are good people, and Israelities even better. Alex loves them, and they loves Alex.</p>

<p>So, IMHO his ban by those global corporation is a conspiracy, a collusion to promote Alex Jones, and increase his popularity in Internet even further.</p>

Next year the NDAA was sent to his desk and he even wrote an address he condemns it and other riders, but can&#39;t win a veto war where the entire defense funding is on the line.</p>

<p>Now can you answer why you say &quot;Obama made it legal&quot; when he had a long fight against it that he lost. Why don&#39;t you mention the Congressman who wanted it. I&#39;m really curious.</p>
