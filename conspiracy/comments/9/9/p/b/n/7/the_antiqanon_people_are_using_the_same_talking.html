<p>They want controlled fact checkers to dictate what is truth and what should be censored. </p>

<p>So what happens when the Qanon conspiracy is brought up on a conspiracy sub? Not surprisingly the anti-Trump users do not want it talked about or discussed. They want you to hate Q conspiracies as much as they want you to hate Trump. Q researchers are actually researching the conspiracies and crimes of the past administration. Why would any conspiracy person be interested in that? We should instead spend all our time and energy hating Trump it seems.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because research involves actual facts. </p>

<p>Q Anon just makes conspiracy people look bad. It makes everyone look stupid. There’s no proof, and it just continues to get more and more ridiculous. Most of the stuff on this sub has basis in fact which is completely opposite of QAnon. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it makes us look bad? We should self censor. These conspiracies haven&#39;t been authorized by the fact checkers? Any conspiracy that isn&#39;t about hating Trump is no longer good for the conspiracy community? Censor Jones and censor Q?  Don&#39;t look over there!!!</p>

<p>I for one am not going to ignore the conspiracies and crimes of the past administration just because of being blinded by hate for the current administration. </p>

<p>Trump is just the actor, keeping all eyes on him, while the rest of the establishment does what they want without public scrutiny. Of course they&#39;re going to make it look like they&#39;re after him, so they can be on the &quot;good side&quot; of the public, so they aren&#39;t molested while passing the things that are beneficial to the elite.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t participate much in GA but keep an eye on it, and to me it looks very staunchly anti-Mueller</p>

<p>Because in my time pushing this theory of Mueller actually going after the real criminals, since october 2017, I have very, very ,very rarely seen any support for it, even among conspiracy minded folks who do support Trump</p>

<p>So I&#39;m just wondering where this recent push against it comes from, while simultaneously insinuating that it is somewhat mainstream among Trump supporters... I just don&#39;t see it</p>
