    <div class="md"><p>No because its such a specific topic that it&#39;ll be difficult to get an actually comprehensive study on it. But my opinion is that the silent majority of this sub is indeed left leaning, as is much of reddit, but a large chunk of the posters here do lean right and there is a feel of alt-right propaganda. This leads to more and more people shouting &quot;shill! brigading!&quot; because posters of the sub seem to be more right leaning while voters of the sub seem more left leaning. </p>

<p>But yea there was a thread maybe a year ago or so that analysed the amount of users which commentend in T_D and which commented in politics. If someone has the link still. Been trying to find it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just hoping for an example of what you consider to be &quot;alt-right propaganda.&quot; Maybe others would consider your conspiracy theories to be Communist propaganda, who knows. I don&#39;t think its helpful to try to pigeon-hole an entire sub.</p>

<p>I also see plenty of people here posting about the Russia conspiracy theory, and you will often get downvoted into double digits for not necessarily agreeing with it. </p>

<p>So I&#39;m just not sure I buy your characterization, it seems to me that you get all sorts in this sub. It might be that you just aren&#39;t used to seeing these more right-wing opinions, because so many other subs out there are total left-wing echo chambers.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t consider those to be Leftist conspiracy theories at all, they are just conspiracy theories discussed by free thinkers everywhere, regardless of political ideology.</p>

<p>No offense, but I think you&#39;re falling for divide and conquer. Hopefully you don&#39;t consider that to be an alt-right conspiracy theory.</p>

But now that they have proved true those same conspiracies are being used by those same powers that created them to dismantle the only parts of the government that are meant to protect and the american people from them under the guise that all government is bad so it needs to be taken apart yet the only parts being taken apart are the ones that help us and protect us from them.</p>

<p>The assertion made by OP was the prevalence of alt-right posters and  to further his argument he attempted to show those who posted what he believes to be alt-right posts were the first to respond against is claim of propaganda. In the context, that definitely aids his argument. </p>

<p>Because most people on the right support little government control while the left welcomes total government control to fix various problems, even going so far as to suggest that socialism is the solution for present day government corruption.</p>

<p>Fascism, a left concept, is total government control. Anarchy, Libertarianism and Anarcho-Capitalism is a right concept that has zero to no government or government control period. </p>

<p>So how does the Non-Aggression Principle work with Fascism? I would really like to hear this.</p>

<p>It would be pretty hard to do this in an anarcho or libertarian style government when there wouldn&#39;t be much political campaign at all since politics would mostly cease to exist.</p>

<p>So then the Democrats are right wing fascists since they are looking for more government control then correct? And the people on the right, who want less government control are then leftists.</p>

<p>And then you have deemed Libertarians to not even be on the scale at all....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No i remember a time when anyone that talked about and tried to expose government conspiricies were part of self described socialist or social change groups and were labeled by the religious controlled right as communist america hating left wing extremists that just hated america and american values, but now that all these conspiracies that the left exposed were proved true those same powers that be that were the one behind those conspiracies are using them to say that the government is bad and we need less government as a manipulation to try and dismantle the parts of government that those same people they labeled left extremists fought to put in place to protect us from them under the guise now that government is bad but the only parts of government they want to dismantle are the ones that help us or protect us from them meanwhile just funneling all that money into their military industrial complex, giant corporate welfare and the banking cartels and federal reserve funneling the money that was going to help us right back to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, if you look at most of the trending topics, most of them express some sort of political bias or are political entirely. Sorting the subreddit by &quot;new&quot; and trying to stay on top of it is what I personally had done. </p>

<p>You&#39;re not the only one noticing it (politicalization in general, that is). I wouldn&#39;t go as far as to say it&#39;s alt-right only, though.</p>

<p>If you can take any silver lining from any of this, my opinion is the qlarp is forcing some people to wake up and to start thinking on their own, albeit being a money grab. I am hoping this is a catalyst (in a broader sense) for us as a civilization to take control of what was ours in the first place - freedom.</p>
