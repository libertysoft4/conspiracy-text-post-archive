<p>Actually I&#39;m not a mod, maybe once, but not now.  As for the theatrics, yes I completely agree, and most the time, if you look at what ever the national debate might be, there is a larger debate above that.  Chomsky was dead on when he said:</p>

<p>The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum.&quot;</p>

<p>No, I didn&#39;t, because A) I&#39;m dyslexic and don&#39;t memorize user names (a shit ton of jumbled names) , and B) good for you for remembering whom some one is and figuring what they mean.... Look, I have no qualms with anyone here... Not interested in a conspiracy dick measuring contest... Nor do I think I&#39;m the smartest man in the room... but you seem to have an axe to grind with me... At least be straight and tell me how I have posted you off.  I&#39;d be interested and honestly, from the bottom of my heart, wouldn&#39;t hold it against you.  Genuinely curious how I have wronged you?</p>

<p>I&#39;d probably start using the trillions in dollars wasted on pointless wars to may enrich those countries, instead of bombing them and creating refugees crises.  Maybe use a little diplomacy over the past 20 years, instead of having 80% of our victims being civilians... How about fighting terrorism with unifying people instead of killing their children...

    <div class="md"><p>U.S. police officers are <a href="http://projects.seattletimes.com/2014/loaded-with-lead/4/">mass-poisoned by lead contamination at firing ranges</a>.</p>

<p>Effects of lead poisoning include violence, anger, and cognitive impairment.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a 2nd Amendment Leftist, but there needs to be an alternative to leaded ammunition.  And police officers themselves should be concerned.  They should demand monthly blood testing or environmental protection standards at their shooting ranges.</p>
