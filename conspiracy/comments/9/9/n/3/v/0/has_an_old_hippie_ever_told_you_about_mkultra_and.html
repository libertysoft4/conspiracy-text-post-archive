I cant really find anything about this except from old random forums. Its weird,  this used to be a biggie. i see tons of shit about roger waters though. If you get past wikipedia and all the waters shit, just read a few different pieces of info about his timeline the top results omit. I wanna see what yal think. Pink floyd was hot shit back then guys. They were like kanye level of influence over the youth etc. When syd lost his shit they blamed it on acid and scared people out of using it. Just look at how strict the laws are on lsd. Nobody wanted to end up on the dark side of the moon ya know</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. People are so black and white about LSD, and sometimes even marijuana in this regard. No, it&#39;s not safe for everyone. I say this as someone who loves his weed and acid.</p>

<p>It largely depends on your brain chemistry, and other underlying psychological factors. It can exacerbate or &quot;unlock&quot; hidden psychological imbalances you had before.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not everyone. In my opinion, these bad trips and breakdowns are reliant on previous trauma, or an underlying genetic issue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a certified psychonaut who lost count of how many times I&#39;ve tripped years ago, I can say for sure that people are built differently and react to different substances in different ways. Schizophrenics and LSD do not mix well. Just cause something works for you does not mean it won&#39;t devastate someone else. I&#39;m all for legalization but the whole &quot;EVERYONE just needs to take LSD&quot; thing is just dumb. Proceed with caution with LSD and other drugs. If you&#39;re not open to what it gives you, it will be painful and traumatic. For some people, a bad psychedelic experience changes their life for the better and rewires them in a better and lasting way. For some people, it sends them into a black hole of darkness from which they aren&#39;t equipped to return from. </p>

<p>If you want all the benefits of LSD without the possible side effects, start meditating regularly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I own &quot;Piper At the Gates of Dawn.&quot;  I happen to be a vinyl hipster and a huge fan of psychedelic rock.  It&#39;s the only album the band released with Syd Barrett.  It&#39;s very experimental, and while I think there are a lot of great things in there and some interesting ideas, not all of the experiments work and a lot of it is just noise.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnHe3WQFl-o&amp;amp;t=0s&amp;amp;list=PLpI6XGqHb_GQIHfInrgA5MWAufzWw5H9z&amp;amp;index=8">Here&#39;s probably the best example of what I&#39;m talking about</a>.  It wasn&#39;t until after Gilmore joined and Barrett left the band that they turned some of those experiments into a more melodic sound and created what would be &quot;The Wall&quot; and &quot;Dark Side of The Moon.&quot;  (The Wall was written about and in honor of Syd Barrett).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s your conspiracy?  </p>

<p>Syd Barrett wasn&#39;t part of the MKUltra tests.  He was living in Great Britain at the time.  The most famous person who was known to have been a subject of the MKUltra tests is Ken Kesey, author of &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo&#39;s Nest&quot; and leader of a group of hippies known as &quot;The Merry Pranksters.&quot;</p>

<p>Was Syd Barrett&#39;s issues with the drug the cause of laws against LSD?  I guess possibly, but LSD was already illegal in the UK two years before Barrett left Pink Floyd and his drug issues became known, and he wasn&#39;t popular in the U.S. at that time, at least not in comparison to the Beatles or the Beach Boys who had both publicly admitted to being under the influence of LSD by that time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean did you even go past the first page of search results or just ignore it cuz u like the band? Some people said it wasnt the acid that fucked him up, they just ran with that to the public to hammer in bad stereotypes about acid. How useful would it be to have an inside dude on the hot new band with the rebellious youth right? until you end up breaking the fucker. And theres different theories. We dont know if gilmour his replacenent actually grew up with them. Thats just what the public has been told. Remember most popular bands are literally engineered dude. like all those boybands that just appear randomly. may have been why gilmour and rogers had their divorce. If it happened the band obv would have covered it up, despite their super deep lyrics they were greedy hypocrites.  the public has no way of knowing what really happened. But as others have pointed out they have connections to freemason and tavistock, and there were rumors at the time that obviously arent on their wikipedia. This isnt uncommon at all for celebrities. In fact its hard to be a celeb unless theyre making you into one. They own the media dude, and youre a prime example of why they do. Just keep jerkin along to ur vinyl ego dude dont let me burst ur fav bands bubble and make all those trip revelations seem shallow lmao</p>

<p>So, you&#39;re saying that the CIA, or the freemasons created the band Pink Floyd, and then before they crossed over to America, kicked out Syd Barrett in order to use him as a propaganda tool to turn the American public away from LSD, and then replaced him with a CIA plant in Gilmore who influenced the band away from Syd Barretts vision and toward promoting the CIA&#39;s agenda?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has nothing to do with america dude, forget that idea. Tavistock is british. Well they were. Them, freemasons, cia are all world wide. That is A theory,  yes. theres a few. Personally i think they saw the band rising with the youth and saw an oppurtunity, and they mkultrad syd into another dimension by accident and just replaced him and told them to blame it on acid and their careers would take off. thought their music after waters left was so shitty for that reason. I cant prove this, i have no sources. Just what ive been told and it makes sense based on stuff ive read. The one you stated is another theory. Nobody knows. Thats the whole point of this thread. Im trying to see if anybody can point me to some info, im not trying to argue about their music with all of yal lmao. Just search it up if you actually give a shit</p>

<p>not rejected he left </p>

<p>Gabriel&#39;s departure from Genesis on 15 August 1975[7][8], which stunned fans of the group and left many commentators wondering if the band could survive, was the result of several factors. His stature as the lead singer of the band and the added attention garnered by his flamboyant stage persona led to tensions within the band.[30] Genesis had always operated more or less as a collective, and Gabriel&#39;s burgeoning public profile led to fears within the group that he was being unfairly singled out as the creative hub. The band also began to feel confined by the reputation (and fans&#39; expectations) attached to their famously elaborate theatrical performances, believing that the visual element of their performances was receiving more attention than their music.</p>

<p>Tensions were heightened by the ambitious album and tour of the concept work The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, a Gabriel-created concept piece that saw him taking on the lion&#39;s share of the lyric writing. During the writing and recording of The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, Gabriel was approached by director William Friedkin, allegedly because Friedkin had found Gabriel&#39;s short story in the liner notes to Genesis Live interesting. Gabriel left Genesis to pursue a film project with Friedkin, only to rejoin a week later.[29] The decision to quit the band was made before the tour supporting The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, with Gabriel explaining his decision to the band while keeping it from the press until the conclusion of that tour. Bassist Mike Rutherford recalled that they all &quot;could see it coming&quot;.[29] Although tensions were high, both Gabriel and the remaining members of Genesis have stated publicly that Gabriel left the band on good terms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has anyone heard the story (not sure if it is urban legend or truth) but the tale goes something like Shine on was written about Syd and whilst they were recording it in the studio Syd walked into the studio right as they were recording that track which was the first time in many years that anyone had even seen him due to his illness he was basically hiding out in his parents basement or something like that. Everyone was astonished that he in an act of sheer kismet walked in in that very moment and then left back into the abyss....Big if true..</p>

<p>Rick Wright: I walked into the studio at Abbey Road, Roger was sitting, mixing at the desk, and I saw this big bald guy sitting on the couch behind. About 16 stone: huge, bald, fat guy. And I didn&#39;t think anything of it. In those days it was quite norm al for strangers to wander into our sessions. I thought, &#39;He looks a bit...strange&#39; Anyway, so I sat down with Roger at the desk and we worked for about ten minutes, and this guy kept on getting up and brushing his teeth and then sitting, doing really w eird things, but keeping quiet. And I said to Roger, &#39;Who is he?&#39; and Roger said &#39;I don&#39;t know.&#39; and I said &#39;Well, I assumed he was a friend of yours,&#39; and he said &#39;No, I don&#39;t know who he is.&#39; Anyway, it took me a long time, and then suddenly I realize d it was Syd, after maybe 45 minutes. He came in as we were doing the vocals for &#39;Shine On You Crazy Diamond,&#39; which was basically about Syd. He just for some incredible reason picked the very day that we were doing a song which was about him. It was a huge shock, because I hadn&#39;t seen him for about six years. He kept standing up and brushing his teeth, putting his toothbrush away and sitting down. Then at one point he stood up and said, &#39;Right, when do I put my guitar on?&#39; And of course he didn&#39;t h ave a guitar with him. And we said, &#39;Sorry Syd, the guitar&#39;s all done&#39;. That&#39;s what&#39;s so incredibly...weird about this guy. And a bit disturbing, as well, particularly when you see a guy and you don&#39;t recognize him. And then for him to pick the very day we start putting vocals on a song about him. Very strange. </p>

<p>The CIA, who basically created the LSD craze, wants to shut down Syd Barrett and early Floyd cuz he was making LSD too popular?</p>

<p>Or, the CIA put Barrett in MKUltra to create a front man for a boyband and they lost control of Syd so had to bring in Gilmour?</p>

Most of the shit im finding is like from years ago dude nothing recent but enough to definitely not be a coincidence. To me at least. Im hoping someone will see this who has stuff i havent seen.
