        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s pretty clear than no one with real power likes Trump. But Trump wants to be liked by power, and he wants power. He&#39;d do anything for either. </p>

<p>Imagine that Power put Trump in the White House and just unleashed him for one purpose: To test the boundaries of how far they can direct the country into turning against their own best interests in order to benefit Power, to see how far a criminal White House administration can get, and how outrageous they can be before facing backlash. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve seen lie after lie. For instance, this morning that felonies aren&#39;t crimes tweeted by Trump. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve seen taxes cut for Power while the people suffer with increased health care costs, trade policy that is costing jobs and more money, and now the potential for federal benefits to be cut to pay for Power&#39;s tax cuts. We&#39;ve seen net neutrality politicized and dismantled. </p>

<p>Perhaps Trump is more than a test balloon, perhaps something more akin to a canary in a mine, destined to die, but telling Power how far they can go from here on out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. Pretty much my thoughts exactly. I had a feeling going into the election that this was going to be the case. The establishment pretends to be appalled by the things Trump does, despite benefiting from it themselves and having done similar things just in a less overt and over the top manner, and then the elite rushes in and plays hero to the people. </p>

<p>The media helps the elite/politicians/intelligence community/military industrial complex etc. spin the narrative that the elite are the good guys and opposed to trump and that they’re our only hope. Unfortunately it’s really looking like enough people are going to fall for it and go running right back into their arms for safety. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couldn’t agree more. </p>

<p>And to all the people here who still say, “well, I don’t necessarily like him, but he’s better than hillary woulda been!”, you’re holding us back.</p>

<p>They have no autonomy at all, they just do what they’re told by the ruling class. People love to say “well, why does the media hate him?”</p>

<p>But these people don’t understand how free publicity can increase somebody’s popularity. Negative publicity in this case from the MSM, gave him some “Street cred” with his followers. He’s more of the same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. It was a huge red flag when the media was lambasting and picking Trump apart from all angles from the time of his announced candidacy onward, ever increasing along the way. The media/news coverage was and has since been almost 24/7 Trump focused negativity. This gave Trump a huge amount of free publicity and as you mentioned, “street cred”. If the media truly did not want Trump to succeed, they simply wouldn’t have dedicated their entire broadcasts and coverage on him, especially early on. They could have just covered him not at all or as little as possible and people’s perceptions would have changed. </p>

<p>If the media didn’t give him a voice and repeatedly shine the spotlight on him, he wouldn’t have gotten anywhere near as popular as he did. Just think of Ron Paul in 2012. He got
Virtually no media coverage what so ever. They didn’t lambast him endlessly every day in the need. His name was rarely ever even mentioned and if it was it was in passing and in a manner that made him seem like a joke. They did the same thing with Ralph Nader too.</p>

<p>That is how they silence the people they really do not want to be heard. That is how the prevent the people from finding the candidate that genuinely cares about them the most and would actually attempt to make change. Also, just look at the absolute lack of of coverage that the third party candidates like Jill Stein received. They weren’t constantly being discussed and ripped to shreds and lambasted in the media like Trump was, they just weren’t discussed. </p>

<p>Also, The DNC/Hillary campaign Wikileaks emails specifically detail part of their detailed plan in conjunction with the media to use the media to pump Trump up as much as possible through the use of constant media coverage, negative or otherwise. This at the very least proves that they wanted him to win the Republican nomination. Without the DNC/The Hillary Campaign/the media/the establishment/so called pundits and paid “experts” doing the fear mongering, Trump wouldn’t have stood a chance at winning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>America? Run by a greedy plutocracy, which backs rightward-leaning candidates who will enact guaranteed tax cuts and deploy the full arsenal of corporate welfare, while stripping the poor of every cent they can be taken for?</p>

<p>I simply refuse to believe this absurd notion. Apart from the history of every single GOP presidency since Reagan&#39;s, and most of the policies enacted during the Democratic ones too, there is not a shred of evidence for it.</p>

<p>Ridiculous flapdoodle that gives conspiracy theorists a bad name.</p>
