My thoughts on this matter is they could literally cut the network and only allow police to communicate “police state” I&#39;ve seen some big brand new Mobile Fiber/Cell trucks lately these are  easily 1 million dollar trucks, for cell safety and reliability. Last year about half of California cell service went down because of one server went down I don’t think that was true and maybe it was a test. What are your thoughts on this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Scary thought, yes. I&#39;d love to see some empirical data that references network bandwidth / throughput and cellular call load over a period of time. </p>

<p>Where I&#39;m getting to is that I think that this is something that can be easily justified as long as there were a basis for it. However, without what I mentioned, you hit the nail on the head, you should be a bit scared of that. Personally, I&#39;ve never had cellular / outbound calling issues since 9/11/2001 (no joke). What have your experiences been?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My grandpa, who died in the 80s, had a ham radio- had no idea what it&#39;s all about, still don&#39;t really, but I do remember things about it. He was an engineer for 3m and had shelves of what I could only describe as big metal boxes with cool lights and lots of switches and buttons, like from an old sci-fi movie. He had some in his room too- I knew he could talk to people around the world. He had a map hanging up on his closet door with pen drawn lines and coordinates written on it and a tower he put on the property. I also remember his handle til this day- it was on his license plate. I can tell a ham radio user if they have certain sequence. Sorry- got nostalgic.</p>
