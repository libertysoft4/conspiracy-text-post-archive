It seems like they are almost promoting it. It never used to be like that. Just started within the past year or so.  I don&#39;t watch that stuff nor is this an extreme, abnormal porn website. Also, commercials on TV I have noticed tend to have black men with white women as their partners. Websites tend to harp on celebrity stories where a white female is with a black male. I don&#39;t understand this? Has anyone else noticed this?</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I was asking, I wasn&#39;t sure what the point of the post was and I made the comment skeptical of your intentions </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t noticed that and I see ads all the time from YouTube and the TV. Perhaps you didn&#39;t log out of Facebook before watching interracial porn </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think i see what youre sayin. Im pickin up what ur layin down, i just think ur perspective can be tweaked just a smidge and youll see it differently.</p>

<p>Medias “push” for or about interracial families isnt a push at all but instead a reflection of reality. because we are more connected than ever before we can see ppl and relationships from around the nation instead of ones local bubble.</p>

<p>in reality, interracial relationships are more commonplace in some parts than others. so in those “others” parts where that is not acceptable, weird, odd, different, etc, seeing it on tv WILL seem like a push. When in reality its simply a more accurate depiction of reality.</p>

<p>tldr and imo - not a conspiracy, just an acceptance of reality. </p>

<p>Interracial marriage didn&#39;t become legal in the states until like 1970 - and in some places, by some people <em>ahem</em>, it&#39;s still seen as &quot;weird&quot; whereas most of us could give two shits. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you’re looking for a conspiracy about this then I got you. I read in a book that this doctor from the early 1900s discovered that people inbreed (distantly. Like Jews) tend to have their families live more generations. Opposite of this, families who breed with someone far from their ancestry (blacks and whites as you mentioned) only last about 3 or 4 generations. </p>

<p>It could be a promotion to breed with those far from us because it results in us dying off faster. </p>

<p>I don’t necessarily believe this and I’m sure there are exceptions but I thought you might mind it interesting. </p>
