        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Maybe conspiracy connoisseurs already knew this but the last one listed below was news to me.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>JFK</strong></li>
<li><strong>Lyndon</strong> <strong>Johnson</strong> (Speaking at the Pepsi Bottlers annual convention.)</li>
<li><strong>George HW Bush</strong> (this is more speculative, but it seems to be accepted by followers of the JFK that he was in Dallas working. His inability to remember where he was, the day Kennedy was shot, only increases suspicions he was there for nefarious purposes.) </li>
<li><strong>Richard M. Nixon (RMN) -</strong> This was news to me. It is also apparently public knowledge as his visit and speech to Pepsi Bottlers the day before is documented in various newspapers. </li>
</ul>

<h1>Family of Secrets - A Worthwhile Read</h1>

<p>I have been reading book excerpts and watching videos by Investigative Journalist <strong>Russ Baker</strong> (he is a Mainstream Reporter and not some fringe guy if that is what your assuming.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1608190064/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0">Family of Secrets: The Bush Dynasty, America&#39;s Invisible Government, and the Hidden History of the Last Fifty Years</a> (Published 2009.) </p>

<p>Youtube also has a number of Book Review type interviews with Russ Baker that are interesting.</p>

<p>In any event, the Book provides some very interesting context to some seemingly unrelated events by examining the whereabouts, motivations, history, friends and abilities of <strong>George HW Bush (&quot;Poppy&quot;).</strong></p>

<p><strong>For example, how did JFK and 3 future Presidents all end up in Dallas on the same day, especially Nixon and presumably Bush?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Nixon apparently left Dallas early in the morning of Nov. 22 and was in the air when Kennedy was killed.</strong> He found out when he landed and as one can imagine, Nixon was very disturbed that he was in the same city as his supposed political &quot;nemesis&quot;. Those are some bad optics, if nothing else.</p>

<p>It is interesting how Nixon ended up in Dallas that day though. He was invited several weeks earlier at the behest of a friend and <strong>Pepsi</strong> Executive Donald Kendall. <strong>In addition to being close to Nixon, Kendall seems to have had some pretty close ties to the Bush family.</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Kendall was a close friend of the Bush family and a fellow resident of Greenwich, Connecticut. In 1988, he would serve in the crucial position of finance chairman for Poppy Bush’s successful run for the presidency.</em>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So much has been written about the Kennedy assassination that the book&#39;s dive into the JFK conspiracy might be interesting, but not necessarily completely stacked with new revelations. <em>(It&#39;s very interesting how Johnson ended up in Dallas, too.)</em></p>

<h1>Watergate</h1>

<p><strong>The information about Watergate was much more intriguing and it really makes one wonder about the Bush Dynasty, especially &quot;Poppy.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>To keep this short, Poppy seems to have been more intimately involved in pushing the Watergate story, and Nixon&#39;s eventual resignation, as a member of Nixon&#39;s administration. You can start to conclude that <strong>not only did Poppy have a hand in JFK&#39;s death, but also setting up Nixon</strong> (an already paranoid type) to take the fall for the Watergate Burglaries that seem to have been set up by Poppy himself.</p>

<p>Moreover, if Poppy really did take down both <strong>JFK and RMN</strong>, the assassination attempt on <strong>Ronald Reagan</strong> in 1980 seems more suspicious than what the history books have always reported or coincidences that have long been swept under the rug. </p>

<p><strong>Finally, since Reagan lived, the Iran Contra scandal is worth another look in the context of Poppy&#39;s proclivity to make President&#39;s go away.</strong> </p>

<p>Here are <a href="https://whowhatwhy.org/2012/05/07/watergate-revelations-the-coup-against-nixon-part-1-of-3/">three Chapters Excerpted</a> from &quot;Family of Secrets&quot;. These Chapters mostly focus on Watergate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. The book insinuates that <strong>Prescott/Poppy Bush</strong> arranged for the Pepsi Executive to invite Nixon to Dallas.</p>

<p>Nixon was not involved in the assassination most people agree, however, casual followers might find it curious since Nixon barely lost to JFK only three years before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Involved, perhaps not directly, but prepared for the aftermath and had no doubt been told by none other than Prescott Bush, who had groomed and supported Nixon from the start, that he was going to win in his next run for the Presidency.</p>

<p>There was also Nixon&#39;s unusual and somewhat cryptic reference to &quot;the Bay of Pigs thing&quot; which many believe was the way he referred to JFK&#39;s assassination without ever directly saying or inferring that&#39;s what he meant by it, or the possibility that &quot;the plumbers&quot; who broke into the Watergate headquarters of the DNC were after some kind of evidence or a photograph that could tie them and Nixon to JFK&#39;s assassination.</p>

<p>And along even more conspiratorial lines is this unusual tale and evidence that surrounds GHW Bush and that he wasn&#39;t the son of Prescott Bush at all but rather the son of George H. Scherff, the man who was Nicola Tesla&#39;s accountant and according to this item a German spy as well...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Found it!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6k469b/on_the_day_jfk_was_killed_a_man_named_george_h_w/">On the day JFK was killed, a man named George H. W. Bush was in Houston, TX overseeing the operation on behalf of the CIA. To obscure his true location, he called in a fake tip to the FBI that same afternoon from &quot;Tyler, TX&quot;. Classic spycraft. Here&#39;s the memo from the phone call.</a></p>

<p>Lots of good discussion there, too. </p>

<p>Soon after, he and his wife boarded a plane for Washington to offer their help to the newly sworn in LBJ.</p>

<p>So many tangled webs were woven.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read a book years ago about the assassination and the theories behind it, whether it was Kennedy wanting us out of Vietnam or whatever, and the PTB made sure Johnson saw what his fate would be if he didn&#39;t play along.

<p>I bet there’s so much that was left out for time constraints as well that a book could dive deeper into. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a party at oil magnate Clint Murchison&#39;s home in Dallas the night before where Johnson and Nixon attended, as well as New Orleans mob boss Carlos Marcello, Jack Ruby and a man named Mac Wallace, who was a longtime hired gun for LBJ. This is according to Murchison&#39;s maid at the time and covered by James Tague, the third gunshot victim on that day, in his book <em>LBJ and the Kennedy Killing</em>. </p>

<p>Another notable name present in Dallas on 11/22 was Jean Souetre aka Michael Mertz, a Corsican assassin and French secret service agent. He was likely codenamed QJ/WIN and was on the CIA payroll, as he was working under the CIA covert op ZR/RIFLE.  He was expelled from the country just 18 hours after the assassination. Coincidence?</p>

<p>HOUSTON — They still talk about the Saturday night here 27 years ago when Donald J. Trump partied with former President <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/23/obituaries/37th-president-richard-nixon-81-dies-master-politics-undone-watergate.html">Richard M. Nixon</a>. ...  </p>

<p>... Dressed in tuxedos, they sang “Happy Birthday” to Texas royalty — former Gov. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/16/us/john-connally-of-texas-a-power-in-2-political-parties-dies-at-76.html">John B. Connally</a> and <a href="http://www.chron.com/news/houston-deaths/article/Ex-Texas-first-lady-known-for-grace-and-wit-dies-1851491.php">his wife, Nellie</a>, whose birthdays were a few days apart...  </p>

<p>... And it was one of Mr. Trump’s first presidential experiences, as he socialized with and had the ear of a former president for two days in Houston at a gala event, an impromptu after-party at Tony’s, a Sunday brunch the next day at a River Oaks mansion and later aboard his plane. ...  </p>

<p>... It happened one weekend in March 1989.   </p>
