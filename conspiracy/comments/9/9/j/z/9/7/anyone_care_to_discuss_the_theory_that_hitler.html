<p>No one knows what really went down since the Soviets didn&#39;t keep many records. And if you were trying to secretly escape to another country, you wouldn&#39;t want people to know that you didn&#39;t die there.</p>

<p>Hitler also had doppelgangers who posed as him.</p>

<p>He was rich and one of the most powerful people in the world. The Nazi&#39;s also had strong technology plus other fascist supporters in South America.</p>

<p>Asking Bormann wouldn&#39;t help, since Bormann died in berlin. He tried to escape but was killed and buried near Lehrter Station. His remains were unearthed in 1972 and found to be his, and genetic testing carried out years later confirmed it. So, these stories (like the fiction pushed by that garbage program <em>Hunting Hitler</em>) which have Bormann and Hitler together in South America fail immediately on that ground.</p>

<p>As well, Hitler&#39;s body was seen by people in the bunker and his jaw frgament was identified by one of his dental team. As well, why would Joseph and Magda Goebbels have killed themselves and their children when they could have escaped? They wanted to go down with Hitler. Read Magda&#39;s last letter to her son.</p>

He believed that his &amp; Germany&#39;s fates were inextricably bound, he WAS Germany and vice versa. Both would either emerge from the war in glorious triumph or go down together in a grand blazing spectacle of ashes, ruin, and death. All or nothing, he wouldn&#39;t live without Germany and he believed that Germany should not exist without him. Like the possessive psycho ex-husband/boyfriend who doesn&#39;t want to live without his wife/girlfriend and doesn&#39;t want her to live without him.</p>

<p>A skull fragment was recovered form the burial pit a year after the war. This was examined in 2009 by Dr. Nicholas Bellantoni who found female DNA on it. The fragment was not attached to a body, nobody involved in the recovery ever claimed it was his. It&#39;s a red herring, it proves nothing. The dental remains are the real proof of his death in Berlin.

    <div class="md"><p>I never really gave the official story a second thought until till the FBI released a trove of files. The Feds didn&#39;t trust the Russian story and spent several years fielding reports from supposed eye witnesses.</p>

<p>Even though the US had been picking up <a href="https://vault.fbi.gov/adolf-hitler/adolf-hitler-part-04-of-04/view">chatter of a potential escape to Argentina as early as 1944</a> (page 139), it doesn&#39;t seem like they followed up on any of the newer leads very well. Then again maybe the Feds didn&#39;t really want to find him and were collecting intel to make sure he stayed hidden. </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is a pretty good article about the happenings:

    <div class="md"><p>My guess is that he most likely  escaped to Antarctica or Argentina. One thing is for sure, he didn’t die in the bunker. Stalin himself even said that the body wasn’t Hitler. The evidence of it being him were, dental records. Not from his dentist, they could only find a former member of his dental team, and he had no documents of Hitlers dental records, he drew a sketch of them from memory and the sketch supposedly matched up. What a load of crap lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should treat that series as fiction. They completely misrepresent the situation. For example, they claim that there were no eyewitnesses to Hitler&#39;s body in the documents they examined, but they were examining Allied documents from immediately after the war. The eyewitnesses from the bunker had been taken prisoner by the Soviets and their testimony wasn&#39;t available to the Allies at that stage. Any average WW2 historian would have known this, so they can only have been intending to mislead in that programme. They also talked about Bormann being in South America but didn&#39;t (as far as I can remember) mention that Bormann&#39;s remains were found in Berlin in 1972 and later confirmed by DNA testing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My first thought was to check where he could have gone. The Russians came from the South-ish East and the Allies came from the North-ish west, so I feel he would have had to escape to a port in East Germany/Poland instead of going to Denmark. But Germany did not have any naval bases there so it would have had to be an extremely low key event somehow organized to skip past Russian forces and the combined power of British and US intelligence to sneak onto a stray U Boat, which would then have to make it though the straights between Denmark and Norway undetected, which all seems very unlikely.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Unless, of course, he had allied help. But I don&#39;t know enough about the theories so I couldn&#39;t really say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, while I have no doubt that he could have escaped if he wanted to, I don&#39;t think that he would have, his personality wouldn&#39;t have allowed him to. He believed in what he was doing and that it was the right thing to do for the German people, right up until the end, and then after all he had done, having to abandon his country and live in exile? No, he would have seen that as unacceptable.</p>

<p>He would have fought to the end, and then once the realisation dawned on him, he would have killed himself to prevent his capture and/or execution. His last act of defiance, to die on his terms by his own hand and not by that of the allies.   </p>

<p>At least that&#39;s what I think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To speculate further, he could have also set explosives in the bunker in the hopes of destroying his remains. We know that by the end of the war he had become rather unhinged due to his drug use and what some people suspect was the early onset of Alzheimer&#39;s and dementia, what better way to cause confusion about what happened then to make sure there isn&#39;t a body?</p>

<p>If you run, doesn&#39;t matter how much you change your appearance, you could still get caught or sold out by someone who knew where and who you were, but to kill yourself and destroy the remains, have others escape and fuel the rumour that you have survived, now that sounds exactly like the kind of crazy megalomaniacal plan he would have come up with to create his legacy.</p>

Each independently reconstructed the details of Hitler&#39;s dental work from memory.
