    <div class="md"><p>For the lakes. Look how the Dead Sea and the flood of Noah sea... they fill with tsunami crashes. And they empty from solar flare discharges. Every small body of water shows evidence of massive water level drop exactly when Robert schoch says a solar flare happened. Weird figures in the sky to make up more religion bs. 40 days of rain. 150 days for the glaciers to melt. Hell on earth as told by the geologic record. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean 9,500 ish BC. Geologic dates have a thousand year range usually with stuff like this. There could have been multiple aftershocks of solar flares, confusing the data. As described by Robert schoch. I have full confidence he will slay the demagogues. </p>

<p>And I’m suggesting that the pyramids were built at the earliest before the solar flare. The solar flare might have started a slave rebellion from the famine. Solar flares cause famine. Or the tsunami in 5,500 BC. I’m just throwing it out there we need to adjust our assumptions and reevaluate the evidence. Graham Hancock is right. He said this so long ago. John Anthony west isn’t alive to see my ideas, it’s very sad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s the fun part. His next book will explain. I believe there are nano diamonds from the extreme lightning. And vitrification of rocks. That’s where the ancient alien people were into something but it wasn’t rocket ships that vitrified the high monuments. It was the huge mega lightning bolts. </p>

<p>That and the sudden drop in lake levels. </p>

<p>Otherwise, it is the silent killer and secret to understanding how the Bronze Age ended. Eric Cline gets so close but he only went as far to say chain earthquakes/volcano explains the end. </p>

<p>Well there would be massive northern lights freaking people out near the equator. Yea the carrington event reaches the equator. </p>

<p>There’s other theories that the particles give hurricanes particles to condensate on, making mega hurricanes. I believe the smallest solar flares cause that now too. </p>

<p>The surge of rain after the drop in lakes would be from a sky full of instantly evaporated water and then the mega hurricanes that follow </p>

<p>Just a brief summary of what I’ve loosly observed many different people suggest. There is no unified theory yet and all you see is idiots on TV saying humans are the single variable causing climate change/hurricanes. Or religious idiots who say Katrina/ New Orleans was punished for being naughty (like the atlanteans)</p>

<p>Merer recorded the logs in the 27th year of Khufu&#39;s reign. His records say that the Great Pyramid was near completion, with much of the remaining work focusing on the construction of the limestone casing that covered the outside of the pyramid, Tallet and Marouard wrote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool story bro</p>

<p>William Ryan and Walter Pitman, in Noah&#39;s Flood (1998), describe the evidence for the sudden flooding of the Black Sea through the Bosporus in 5600 BC, and the diaspora of the mixed-farming (farming, hunting, fishing) people to Europe and Central Asia (as well as the spread of Indo-European languages). Europe was largely populated by these farmers fleeing the catastrophic flooding of the Black Sea. By 5400 BC they had reached as far as Paris.</p>

<p>In circa 5600 BC, the Bosporus cracked open and the Black Sea was flooded with a fury of Mediterranean salt water dropping 500 feet (150 meters) into the depression, a process mostly completed in a few months. It is likely that externally induced seismic activity caused the Bosporus to open up. Once started, the flooding was unexpectedly rapid, moving miles per day in the low-lying river valleys. Details of this event will be incorporated much later into the story of a worldwide flood by the farmers and fisherman of the Black Sea.</p>

<p>Parts of the initial waves of people spread to Anatolia, the Levant, and Mesopotamia. At least, so it could be assumed. The warmer and moister climate throughout the world after 5800 BC allowed farming to return to the Middle East. This climate also opened up the sub-arctic regions for habitation: Norway, Sweden, Finland, northern Russia, Siberia, Alaska, and northern Canada. Thousands of years later, as the climatic conditions worsened again in the north, we will wonder why so many tribes appear to move south from the far north.</p>

<p>Those who dispersed to Central Asia return on horseback a thousand years later, as the armed Kurgan nomads and herders, and established themselves throughout Europe. After 2000 BC there were additional movements (of Indo-European speakers) from south central Asia into the Middle East (Iran and Anatolia).</p>

<p>The flooding of the Black Sea is well established and well dated. The secondary effect of the flood was the spread of agriculture into Europe and Central Asia with the migration of people away from the Black Sea region. Indo-European languages show up as far east as the western borders of China. An overflow of Indo-European speakers from Central Asia entered India and Persia.</p>

<p>The sea takes its name from Marmara Island, which is rich in sources of marble, from the Greek μάρμαρον (marmaron), &quot;marble&quot;.[2]</p>

<p>The sea&#39;s ancient Greek name Propontis derives from pro- (before) and pontos (sea), deriving from the fact that the Greeks sailed through it to reach the Black Sea, Pontos. In Greek mythology, a storm on Propontis brought the Argonauts back to an island they had left, precipitating a battle where either Jason or Heracles killed King Cyzicus, who mistook them for his Pelasgian enemies.[3]</p>
