    <div class="md"><p>Not just defaulting on loans. Less people are buying cars as we have already reached the peak of the market (as far as people buying cars). Car companies have to decide to stop making cars, or give bigger discounts on their cars. Also longer loan terms are being given out. Which means less per month. So of course, people buy more expensive cars and features when they really can&#39;t afford it. </p>

<p>Have you noticed how many nice newer cars are on the road? ANYBODY can get a nice car these days. Go to a used car lot and you will see mostly nicer and newer cars. People are also losing equity on their older cars because the newer used cars are so damned cheap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wouldn’t necessarily be the auto industry crashing. It would be defaults on the loans that were used to buy cars already. Similar to a 2008 mortgage crisis where loans were made to  borrowers at too low of rates given their risk of default. It could hit banks hard but not so much as defaults on mortgages just given long term value of the underlying asset. Would be a shit show for GM given they have their own financing wing, GM Financial.</p>

<p>The idea the USA government is in charge is ludicrous.  They&#39;re the right hand of those in charge but hardly the benefactor.  </p>

<p>I think we&#39;re at the point where the world bank united all the countries and made them dependent on each other and we&#39;re either going to realize that the world relied on the USD which was never a measure of value added and simply a labor based trade.  Meaning if you have $100m in the bank, it doesn&#39;t mean you created $100m of value to the world.  I think hollywood and their copyright laws show nothing needs to be gained by the paying party, even if their money was earned for creating something of value.</p>

<p>It <strong>is</strong> something else. Flat earth and lizard people are just the extremes. There are plenty of real people that believe flat earth and lizard people, so there is an organic force as well. If there is any manufacture by TPTB, I&#39;d suggest looking at the posts/points which draw the most legitimacy to those theories. Creating an organic, independent movement of crazies is the most effective deterrent imaginable.</p>

<p>They probably don&#39;t, but a CIA psyop makes the prevalence of that mode of thinking greater.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, I&#39;m a conspiracy theorist myself. I know conspiracies exist. They get exposed all the time in things called &quot;trials&quot; and many, many more go unexposed. That&#39;s just a fact that I&#39;m ready to defend, even if I don&#39;t understand how one could argue against it.</p>

<p>But there are people, who I consider &quot;Deep-enders&quot;. People who have dabbled in the arts and gone too far. </p>

<p>1) Paranoitic. The real ones, to be treated. The paranoia is there before any conspiracy theory. When you are younger, you see dark shadows in places. You know everyone is laughing at you. You know something is not right. And then you find conspiracy theories and you finally know what is not right. And it fits. No one else believes, just you. You and your small circle of confidants. Who make it worse. So if you now smell something funny? It&#39;s the CIA. If now someone follows you? It&#39;s the KGB. If now the lights flicker in the room? Mossad. </p>

<p>2) Religious zealots. It has all the aspects of religion when you think about it. I&#39;m dissatisfied with the world. It&#39;s fucked. Why is it fucked? Well, I read this <del>bible</del> webpage and here, there is a conspiracy. But what can I do? Oh, I have to do nothing. Because <del>the rapture</del> something will happen that will blow it all out of water! The Great Awakening! The exposition! And they will all get what&#39;s coming to them and it will all be alright then. Whoever is against that is just an <del>Satanist unbeliever</del> shill and fuck him. I&#39;m absolutely impotent and powerless against the huge chaos of the world, but it will get corrected and then everything will be fine. So I&#39;ll just sit here, smug, cause being smug is my only line of defence against the world.</p>

<p>3) Self-worth. I&#39;ve amounted to nothing, I&#39;m worth nothing to no one. Why? Jews. But I got something you don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve got the feeling that I&#39;ve got it all figured out. My failure is my hobby, my mistakes are my projects. I inspect them and find the faults of others everywhere. If I&#39;m so smart, why ain&#39;t I rich? Jews. Come, I&#39;ll show you the graphs. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are more in my mind now, but I&#39;ve already given it too much thought, you know. It&#39;s sometimes just tiresome. You find someone who shares your beliefs, but, again, he is not looking for the truth, but for a hole to bury himself in. Also, shut the fuck up, shill, I have my safehouse to return to.</p>

<p>Paranoid Schizophrenia is a real mental disorder, and anyone who has it will have conspiratorial machinations well before being exposed to the conspiracy community. Equivocating the two is irrational. Now, if you mean to say that there are paranoid people in the conspiracy theory, I&#39;d agree. Some rationally so, some irrationally so. Some may have had paranoid predispositions, others not. If you feel the government or some criminal, violent entity is after you, and you don&#39;t have any sway or power, you&#39;re irrationally paranoid. Joe Rogan once said, &quot;if you aren&#39;t paranoid...&quot; (or at least cynical, IMO) &quot;you&#39;re not paying attention&quot;. That doesn&#39;t mean you should go off the deep end, you don&#39;t have to take yourself and everything so seriously all the time.</p>

<p>This is a defense against fear, making use of blind faith in the improvement of the conditions of being. This is not endemic to conspiracy theory, it&#39;s endemic to the human condition, and conspiracy theorists are also humans. Hopeless, desperate humans, with little locus of control-most people in the world are. Their religion is not the conspiracy theory. Their religion is hope, and they attach it to their worldview, which in this case happens to involve conspiracy theories. You&#39;re describing most people on earth. You can see this kind of person in every society in the world. </p>

<p>Again this is not endemic to the conspiracy community. Racial based, class based, intelligence based, economic based, and even ethical based posturing and ranking along social hierarchy, internally and externally, is a feature of every society on earth, every individual on earth. In this case, it has been attached to Jews specifically. There&#39;s a reason for that by the way-it&#39;s a reactionary, defensive response to assault. In the case of Jews, it is a cultural and political policy assault. I don&#39;t believe, &quot;it&#39;s the jews&quot; as some put it, but there are some very interesting polls on public opinion of different demographics along ethnic, religious, political, racial, and gender criteria, that reveal what Jews think about non-jew whites, and evangelical christians in particular. What&#39;s more, the Israeli lobby in the U.S. is profoundly influential. Since your example was so specific to an existing conspiracy theory, I felt the need to refute a particular assertion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so what you have done here is repeated everything that I have already said and added &quot;this is not endemic to the conspiracy community&quot;. </p>

<p>While, I mean, it is exactly endemic to conspiracy community. Because all the people who have the things I stated are attracted to conspiracy theories and thus fill the community. </p>

<p>I mean, either we both have different definitions of &quot;endemic&quot; or you disagree that people who look for secret explanations are drawn to places that offer secret explanations. </p>

<p>I feel like you came in guns blazing, <em>rubbing hands</em> and trying to refute(?) what I said, just to repeat everything and then stand victorious(?). I&#39;m kind of confused here, but then again, that&#39;s a given.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You may as well just state that people in general have the things you stated, and are attracted to conspiracy theories and thus, people fill the community. I personally find little that is profound in your statement. The people in this community are the same as anywhere else in the world.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>False dichotomy fallacy. There are plenty of other explanations. In my case, I am arguing that the pathologies you&#39;ve noted are not remarkable or exceptional. These kinds of people don&#39;t just come here. They go to every community you can imagine. They inhabit all places, and they are going to inhabit this one. That is to say, there is nothing about the conspiracy community that attracts them in particular. This community attracts all kinds of people from all walks of life, of all kinds of pathologies.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>People who look for secret explanations also turn to cults, religions, the forefront of scientific research, law enforcement etc.</p>

<p>Alright, that&#39;s that then. Here is the thing. While I characterized the people I mentioned, I will now take a jab at you so you understand why I am going to go do something else, ok?</p>

<p>Some people like the sound of their voice. You like to write. There is a high possibility that you reread your own comments and marvel over them. In all of this you have not addressed anything and you have spent most of your time repeating what I have said. I am absolutely sure you enjoy it. Because, at the end of the day, in your own eyes you come out as smart. </p>

<p>What you have done is stated that people who like conspiracy theories are everywhere. Which is, well, true. That&#39;s how the world works. It seems like you do not consider people who are attracted to conspiracies and believe in them as part of the conspiracy community. And then you have argued against the fact that people who like conspiracy theories are drawn to conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just, again, stating this so you see why I don&#39;t feel the need (or wish) to continue, just to reread everything I&#39;ve said with some superfluous info springled on top of it. </p>

<p>Not okay, it detracts from the conversation, and I wouldn&#39;t do the same to you.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I have not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems like you do not consider people who are attracted to conspiracies and believe in them as part of the conspiracy community. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incorrect, I have only explicitly acknowledged that they are in fact here and are a part of the community as much as anyone else.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And then you have argued against the fact that people who like conspiracy theories are drawn to conspiracy theories.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if I made this argument, which I did not, it doesn&#39;t say anything. People that like conspiracy theories are drawn to them? How is that not equivocal? You may as well have said that people that like conspiracy theories like conspiracy theories, or that people that are drawn to conspiracy theories are drawn to conspiracy theories. There&#39;s no difference.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve clearly not grasped my statements, as your misrepresentation of those statements shows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is entirely possible that these events are meant to distract from specific events, and I believe I may have witnessed that before, but in general the primary distraction is not just from the growing wealth gap and siphoning of wealth into the hands of fewer and fewer people. </p>

<p>It&#39;s more than that. It&#39;s not to just delay an inevitable class warfare, actually I&#39;d say it&#39;s more to modify the inevitable class war, to direct it, shape it, and become a part of it. Every authoritarian government in the world is founded on extreme, widespread violence, which the people participate in willingly.</p>

<p>These &quot;distractions&quot; are more than distractions. <a href="/u/XanLV">/u/XanLV</a> said it best, &quot;The US citizen is pretty full of himself if he thinks anyone is trying to distract him while fucking his mother in plain view.&quot; It isn&#39;t as much about fleeting distraction (there is an element of that) as it is about transformation, which is just a permanent or long lasting distraction in this context. </p>

<p>The information war is rooted in the age old divide and conquer strategy. This has always been the case-it&#39;s never changed. The difference is that today, society is far more liberal, so the tools of manipulation have become more liberal. This also makes them more effective, because they can now operate under the guise of empathy and compassion as well, as a proactive force-instead of just defense of established paradigms as a reactive response. In this way, the dominant culture can assail selected groups with impunity and sew more widespread, lasting division. </p>

<p>I find there are many &quot;socialist&quot; or &quot;liberal&quot; policies that are effective and reasonable measures. However, identity politics, and radical progressivism, present an existential threat to humanity for a number of reasons. For the sake of this conversation, they present the most effective tool for division ever exemplified in human history. You hear people say stuff like, &quot;eat the rich&quot; without recourse, as if it is okay demonize and assail one another not by the merits of one&#39;s actions, but rather by identity alone.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the greatest distraction, and partisanry, and ideological enslavement make it impossible for many people to acknowledge this and address it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it really isn&#39;t fair they downvoted you for such a well-thought out response.
it&#39;s probably a reflection of the rising tide of socialist fervor that&#39;s becoming mainstream. just the other day Tucker Carlson on Fox News started to echo Bernie Sanders and pointing out the ills of income inequality that has gotten out of hand. I thought i was in Bizarro World-- Fox News was championing the cause of the poor? He was asking Jeff Bezos to pay Amazon employees more.
Makes you wonder how bad things have gotten...
IMO without some form of scary identity politics based in class--with the masses of poor banding together--the powerful will never make policies that help common people but will continue to reward their donors. There have been times when our elected leaders feared Americans like Nixon feared the Vietnam protestors, and FDR feared the radical leftists and workers&#39; unions during the Great Depression. The problem is today our elected officials don&#39;t fear the people anymore so they try to get away with the most outrageous acts of corruption and greed. I don&#39;t know if they will enact policies to help working class folks by us asking Nicely. That hasn&#39;t worked. We got to scare our leaders.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>just the other day Tucker Carlson on Fox News started to echo Bernie Sanders and pointing out the ills of income inequality that has gotten out of hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Too much of anything is a bad thing. In the past, massive income equality was absolutely necessary to organize capital, but today with the internet, crowdfunding has removed the necessity. We can objectively look at massive income inequality as a symptom of our freedom to organize ourselves economically. Everyday it becomes less beneficial. More success procures more opportunity which in turns affords greater success, in a feedback loop that logically can not be sustained and creates social problems.</p>

<p>Fighting income inequality has not been something the right has been opposed to for as long as I can remember. The right merely employs different policies to address the inequality, and IMO, some of them are very logical and efficacious. <em>Perhaps Tucker was championing progressive policy and that is what you were referring to?</em> I can&#39;t say, I didn&#39;t see what you saw.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fox News was championing the cause of the poor? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve never known Fox News to not &quot;champion the poor&quot; as you put it. There are plenty of poor Republicans, it&#39;s objectively in their interest, and in the interest of The Republican party, to devise policies that appear to benefit, or just outright benefit, the poor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He was asking Jeff Bezos to pay Amazon employees more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see what is wrong with that. There&#39;s nothing necessarily not conservative about asking for better wages, whether as an individual, for your own sake-or as an organization, for the sake of others. Now, if Tucker called for the government to raise the minimum wage, that would not be very conservative of Fox News. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Makes you wonder how bad things have gotten... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty fuckin&#39; bad.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Or we could just agree to blacklist anyone that has ever been elected a representative for state of federal government, worked for the bureaucracy, lobbyist organizations, or fortune 1000 companies in an executive capacity, or as a consultant. That&#39;ll eliminate at least 70% of the crooks. Vote them all out and never elect them again. It&#39;s actually pretty simple. I&#39;m not saying it would solve all of our problems, but it&#39;d give us a chance. In fact all anyone needs to do, at least to start, is vote for people that aren&#39;t running in the RNC or DNC. It&#39;s not hard, people are just afraid.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There have been times when our elected leaders feared Americans like Nixon feared the Vietnam protestors</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nixon had contempt for Vietnam protestors, and he brutally undermined that movement, dismantling it. I do not think he was afraid, I think he was angry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FDR feared the radical leftists and workers&#39; unions during the Great Depression.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He may well have feared those folks, <em>they&#39;re scary!</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem is today our elected officials don&#39;t fear the people anymore so they try to get away with the most outrageous acts of corruption and greed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know if fear is the right word. You don&#39;t want your representatives afraid of the people. You want them to love the people, to respect the people, to work for the people. We care too little for quality of character, and are too easily swayed by propaganda.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know if they will enact policies to help working class folks by us asking Nicely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t ask them nicely, just quit voting for them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That hasn&#39;t worked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We keep voting for them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We got to scare our leaders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who knows... it could be fun. ; )</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would be chaotic and breed horrors you cannot fathom.</p>
