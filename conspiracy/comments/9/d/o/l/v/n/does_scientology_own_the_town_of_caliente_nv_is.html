<p>Our conversation went really bad really quick. If you are a Mormon, I am really sorry. I was Mormon the night I stayed in your hotel. I was balling my eyes out in your little hotel. I thought I would never get away from them. Scientology and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are exact opposites. I can see why you would be offended if you are not getting kick backs by reporting who comes into your hotel to some Scientologist in Caliente, NV.</p>

<p>The hospital in your little town was also suspicious. I am sure you can understand why I don&#39;t believe you are Mormon and might be an instrument of Scientology.</p>

<p>If you are in fact a Mormon, I owe you my life.</p>

<p>I found this on the internet recently. Look at what they are doing to people there!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are the second person who has said that to. This is what the owner of the hotel said to me yesterday:</p>

<p>&quot;I just wanted to ad.  The little hospital in town is very creepy.  They were force feeding my mother.  When my sister and I complained to he Nurse she would scream at us.  They ended up life flighting my 84 (at that time) year old mother to St. George where the on duty Doctor said she had aspirated on the chicken and rice. So they were sucking out the top part of her lungs! Sorry to bother you again but thought maybe these first hand accounts. An prove that the hospital is incompetent and strange!
I won’t bother you again,
Robert V. Mull&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I faked a heart attack to get out of the Scientology compound (Narconon Fresh Start) and into town where the hospital is located. I then left the hospital while the Scientologists followed me around in a car. I finally went into a bar. They didn&#39;t follow me in. I then was able to sneak out of the bar. I hid under an RV until nightfall. The owner of a hotel let me stay the night for free. I called him yesterday and asked if he was a Scientologist. He threatened me. I made it clear I plan to visit him. Then he wrote an apology which shows he did in fact offer to lend me his gun.</p>

<p>Normally a family is ruined financially forever by Narconon Fresh Start. Yes they offer financing. But it is a real estate scam to start with. Nothing is more disturbing, until you realize they are technically a church and rob these people, tax free.</p>
