    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree, but you saying he <em>admitted</em> to being a &quot;CIA Op&quot; when he insists it was a one semester internship doesn&#39;t lend your argument any credence.

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but this is when you have to bring logical conclusions into the mix. He admitted to working with the CIA as an internship. That’s a fact. The man is originally a Vanderbilt (fact) and is a huge news anchor for a giant news corporation that’s owned by a handful of companies that have ties to the CIA (fact). So in conclusion he pretty much admitted to being a CIA op indirectly as what CIA op would admit to it directly? They’re going to leave bread crumbs so we have to follow them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I agree. But it&#39;s important to make the distinction between postulation and facts. You postulated and presented it as a fact. This description you gave is how you should explain it, rather than just saying he admitted to being a CIA Op. I agree with your conclusions, but you should frame them as postulations through reasoning and facts rather than framing them as admissions that never happened. </p>

It’s not like they just disappeared and there are no more red flags. He just is acting like everything is all good and for the people who watched his show regularly, they saw through the change. </p>

At the end of that discussion he said he thinks that it probably did happen but that they faked a lot of the footage and pictures during it. No where has he said that there is no way that it’s a hoax but that it’s more likely that we actually went.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A great question about TPTB, why do these individuals draw out our scrutiny more then others.   Did we draw a genuine conclusion or were we directed to participate in collectively sowing doubt?  </p>

<p>We so easily refer to g-men conspiracy, but fail to evaluate the situation as if we were actually dealing with skilled, trained and equpped intelligence groups.</p>

<p>It seems more plausible that in the same way we view societal norms,  those among the wealthy and elite all share unspoken fears of what they have witnessed happen to those among them that have crossed TPTB.  </p>

<p>What are the presumed effects of considering the JRE podcast as a deep state narrative?
      - guests and their material are being aired to create falsehoods or present targets for others
      - similar to the engineered early UFO propaganda, creates a misinformed community that continues to self generate falsehoods</p>

<p>What is the polar opposite side of this view look Like?
     - Joe Rogan is just a human being, who was successful enough to find a way to make a profitable show out of just sitting and talking to people he finds interesting.<br/>
     - Radio and talk shows promote things for sale.  Not directed by malicious intent,  instead the shows guests being relevant to those who have current shows, books and programs available for sale.
     - As his sponsor base grew his ability to be as sensational as he was in the beginning narrowed</p>

<p>What&#39;s more important then either of these views is that the fact that we have to ask these questions is the real product of the engineered state that the availability of truth and transparency has left us with.  This is the area we need to be calling out the CIA for.  </p>

<p>If we can be tempered, decisive and truly investigate rationally, we can defeat any societal engineering tactic.   I believe this narrative about Joe Rogan is making us overlook the bigger picture.   If this truly was a deep state production, there&#39;s no f@%#&amp;$ way they would have people like Stamets, Hancock, McKeanna</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to bother replying to anyone because the conclusions I&#39;ve come to I have come to and there is no changing that...</p>

<p>My instincts on Joe is that he is compromised.  I&#39;m not some raging conspiracy theorists either, I don&#39;t know what to believe about the moon, I&#39;m pretty sure 9/11 was scripted, aliens who the fuck knows.</p>

<p>His demeanor has changed.  He literally at point point (I didn&#39;t save or time stamp the episode) but he&#39;s literally pleading with the government to let him know about aliens, he looks into the camera and says &quot;I will sell out today if I get the truth, I will tell my audience whatever you want me to tell them just fill me in&quot;.  That&#39;s aside from his rude, deamining, and arrogant behavior that&#39;s gotten even worse as of late.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like Joe, I never really did but I at least enjoyed his conversations... Now he&#39;s like a shell of what he was even a year ago... Something changed.   He&#39;s unfunny, even his reoccurring guests know it and dislike him.  Neil degrasse took shots at him last podcast, Ben Owen, and a few others I can&#39;t remember off the top of my head.   Joe is dead to me. I&#39;ve unsubscribed. </p>

<p>Please explain billionaires to me. Why didnt they stop at 100k in the bank. You would be happy to have that. Why didnt they stop at 1mil in the bank?</p>

<p>Why didnt they stop at 100mil in the bank? You could live comfortably for the rest of your life with that, and so could generations after you.</p>
