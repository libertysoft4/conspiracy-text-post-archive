<p>I&#39;m a regular joe with 6 plus figures in student loans. yes I know I signed for them and yes I know it&#39;s my responsibility. biggest mistake of my life. I have a job and am thankful for that but I&#39;m just so damned confused.</p>

<p>I finally created a budget and a forecast and there is literally no life for a few years. every penny will go to pay off debt.</p>

<p>Now the conspiracy in me thinks this whole student debt crisis  thing was set up to keep us in a negative mindset and not look past our own problems. I&#39;m literally anxious all the time about it...maybe I havent accepted it yet.</p>

<p>I know I&#39;m not alone.</p>

<p>What are your theories on the student debt issue of our day?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The average University fees in Ireland (to degree level), work out at about €21,000. A lot of people get various grants and expenses, leaving most paying about €3000 per year, over 4 years. </p>

<p>I paid for private college and it worked out at €27,000 total.</p>

<p>I see guys doing the same course as me in the US, paying $300,000 upwards. </p>

<p>You most probably have a financial conspiracy in your higher education sector when you compare to other countries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think college is a scam. It&#39;s essentially a trade, but in higher education subjects. I got my engineering degree, that would not of been possible without the great professors and other students that went through the same experience with me.</p>

<p>Sure, it&#39;s a bad idea to go get a liberal arts degree. Is it a conspiracy? Absolutely not. That&#39;s like saying being a dumbass is some sort of government conspiracy. Don&#39;t go to college and get a dumb ass degree and put yourself in 100k of debt while having a projected career income of less than 50k/year. That&#39;s retarted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Student Loans are a conspiracy to get you indebted early and accustomed to paying over time for things you will likely never live to appreciate.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, the bank that holds your loans might be able to take your car, your house and your tax refunds for the next 30 years if you default, but they cannot take away your education.  You earned it and that knowledge is yours forever.  If you really want to stick it to them, use that wisdom and your advanced degree to make the world a better place where college is free and future generations aren&#39;t duped into servitude for life.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t the US the only country that wont allow student debt to be written off by bankruptcy? That&#39;s fudged up.</p>

<p>My student debt (6.5k) got written off when the bank I was with folded and I ignored the creditor&#39;s letters. Luckily our laws dont allow for repossessions without court proceedings and 6.5k was too small i guess.</p>

<p>The financial crisis at least gave me that break</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was National Irish Bank, who got bought out by Svensk Bankförening, who then shut operations down and sold debts to a private debt collector. </p>

<p>Firstly, for a debt collector to have effective power under our laws, you must first acknowledge that your debt has been transferred to them This is done by proxy through engagement. I didn&#39;t engage, Ii just ignored.</p>

<p>And secondly, if you do acknowledge the debt, they have to bring you to court to get a judgement before they can collect the debt. They never bothered with court proceedings. I suspect at a time when people were defaulting on mortgages, my 6.5k was too small. </p>

<p>Its been 10 years since they originally bought the debt, so I&#39;m in the clear now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder what happens if I type &quot;Svensk Bankförening&quot; again.</p>

<p>Or if i say that like all banks, they are criminals who can easily be side stepped by not engaging (although that&#39;s only advisable if the laws of your country protect you). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IANAL - But my understanding is that student loan debts usually can&#39;t be forgiven under Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcies.  If the debtor can show that extraordinary circumstances make repaying the student loan impossible or that it would create undue financial hardship, then student loan <em>might</em> be forgiven in that special circumstance.  </p>

<p>As with all things involving the courts, you can always ask, but the result is ultimately up to a judge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup! It&#39;s a joke! I also have that 3 figure debt for some worthless degrees in NON-teaching EDUCATION because I did an associate degree in business prior, and no one told me I was going to run out of student loans before my last semester to student teach (back in my associates degree program, there weren&#39;t any FREE semesters for graduating high school). IT&#39;S A F****** SCAM! They were like, well you can come back to the masters program since you won&#39;t ever get a job with that associate or bachelor degree AND I DID IT but I realized fast that schools would fail soon and I was just wasting money and time. Before I even got to finish, I became chronically ill with Lupus and Neuropathy, and decided to take a hint when the world was giving it to me.</p>

<p>My dumb ass should&#39;ve went to welding school. I&#39;ll have no family, no life, no job, no credit. Nothingness. No man/woman would ever love me enough to give me these things because I&#39;m a decent human. Only bitches and cheaters get a luxury life. Not the ones who did everything right and lost everything anyway.</p>

<p>I am the idiot in the equation. I should have never went to college. I can&#39;t even tell anyone they should unless it&#39;s on full scholarship with a medium wealthy family to support you  because we all know the working-while-schooling methodology is warped at best. </p>

<p>I should be happy that a Nigerian prince didn&#39;t get to me first.</p>

<p>was abuse on their part....maybe/probably....I&#39;ve been angry with my family for a long time now. but I look back and I see how ignorant they were. they bought into the lie and spread it to us. </p>

<p>You hit the nail on the head.  You didn&#39;t have to rack up that much.  There were options.  But as you state you were ignorant.  You could have done this math before hand.  Nothing was hidden from you.</p>

<p>To give some background on how tuition rose so high do some research into when the feds granted more loans.  Then look at when and how much tuition started going up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So i&#39;ve read a lot of this thread and decided to pick you to respond to.  I grew up up in a family that was clawing its way into middle class, education extremely valued as a way for my siblings and i to hopefully advance further than my parents did.  I sat down when i was 18, looked at the cost of college and was like wow $30,000 a semester for a job that has an outlook for 50k/yr.  It just didnt make sense when i could go to a state school for $3500/per semester with like 90% of it covered under other instate benefits.  I graduated with 0 debt.  I applied to places once out of college that offered education benefits because i knew i would eventually want to get my masters.  Again, $0 debt, low cost in state school while working.  There are systems in place for those who want to do things to be able to do them, but the responsibility has to be on the person to analyze and be like does this line up with my opportunities afterwards.  </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I really do not understand the constant blaming the system when people take SUPER ADVANTAGE OF IT without really thinking for themselves.  Maybe thats another issue with america in general, but i remember tons of my friends getting max student loans for state schools (12k vs the actual 4500 or so needed for tuition and books) and then using that extra money to buy video games and drugs.  It is super dumb.  I think a lot of people would advance their lives by just learning to be accountable at an earlier age, and critically think for themselves.  Reach out to those who have been in their shoes before and ask them what makes sense.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can it be a scam to permit and encourage our children to be saddled with tens - sometimes hundreds - of thousands of dollars of debt before they begin to earn a penny.</p>

<p>Students today emerge from college ill-educated. We’ve trained too many of them to be unemployable, and we’ve given them a jobless economy. What’s worse, they come out of college as debt slaves, where everything they earn goes to pay off their debt. At that point, they’ll have to ask themselves: Why bother? It’s like a 100 percent marginal-income tax, which pretty much saps any incentive to go out and earn.</p>

<p>That’s why I’m sympathetic to the more extreme forms of millennial protest. Mostly their demands are nonsensical, but their grievances are real. Right now many of them can’t even keep up with the interest on the loan. They’re the victims of a generational betrayal, where the Baby Boomers paid low tuition, had careers, could raise a family on one income, bought homes and then as college teachers taught them courses that unfitted them for work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reality is that the American government and populations have been exploited by the advanced education institutions. It is a regular trap.</p>

<p>Education = good, therefore the government should help people attend. (Give pell grants etc. that should not even exist) and if someone wants to be better (make more money) they should attend!</p>

<p>That is how it used to be. Now there are thousands of filler classes and faux opportunities at colleges. Attending college is seen as positive. Not everyone wanted to go to college to learn physics (an example)  because that is hard and specialized. People needed to go to college for social benefits, so colleges invented bullshit studies and roads that students could pay towards. The core benefits to colleges still exist. if you want to be a space scientist, you better go. if you want to make money as a writer? Skip it, because there are enough resources and means online to teach yourself and then publish for yourself.</p>

<p>College is a scam for the government to pay into because I attended for two years and got a liberal arts degree. Sure I&#39;m a white male firstborn in a still together family, so I had to pay for most of that myself. However? I still received around 6k in free money from the government. My degree has not made me, or my country, any money. (Self employed and don&#39;t pay taxes.) While my example is anecdotal, it is true of all those who get four year degree in whatever, and proceed to work at a call center. That does not put back into the country (USA) what the country put into its citizens. Who benefits from all of this? The owners of the universities. This is why we cannot have free college, like many want. </p>

<p>Another anecdote. I attended college nine years ago, and returned to finish my shitty two year four years after that. Between those four years cost of admission doubled. Book costs didn&#39;t increase, but do you know what brand new filler horseshit costs were added? To do my homework and receive a grade, I needed to pay eighty dollars to finish the homework inside of the textbook I purchased, online. A cost that should by no means exist, that now does. That is the conspiracy, and you, me and the US government is paying for it to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the conspiracy is people being dumb enough to go into massive debt with no promise of a payoff. No offense to OP, lots of people do it. It just seems mind boggling to me that anyone would accept such an unrealistic debt burden for literally nothing. I mean, it’s not like anyone is forcing you into it. At 18 you should know enough basic math to say that there is not a way for me to realistically pay this off given my likely income post graduation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You go to school for 13 years. In those 13 years you are constantly beaten with the “go to college or be a failure” stick. I remember being in second grade and my teacher said, “do you want to be the person driving the nice car pulling up to the gas pump, or do you want to be the person pumping their gas for minimum wage? If you go to college you will be the person with the nice car.” Growing up my parents hounded me to make good grades so I could go to a good college. Most of the people in my life have told me that you will never make decent money unless you have a piece of paper from a college. When you are young and something is told to you with great repetition by people you look up to and trust, it’s hard to not believe them. Take that and also add that by 18 you have to make a choice, with very little knowledge of how the real world works and you have your answer. I personally don’t owe a dime to any college, but I can absolutely see how millions get duped into thinking they have to go if they want to succeed. The sad part is, the people telling the youth they must go to college think they are doing them a favor. They think they are pressuring you into something that will be exceptionally beneficial to you in the long run, but they are really just pushing you into becoming a debt slave. They are oblivious, because when they went to college they worked part time at McDonalds and paid off their student loans by the time they graduated, or within a year of having their degree. They don’t realize how much the cost of college has inflated, nor do they realize the burdensome loans their children will have to take on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good points indeed. The whole system makes me sick to be honest. I managed to follow the formula and succeed without any debt (thanks to the GA hope scholarship). However, I know many people get locked in without realizing the crushing debt they are getting into. I hesitate to call it a conspiracy, it’s more a combination of ignorance and outdated thinking by those in positions to influence youth, and a profit motive by those offering loans. Now if you look into the privatization of student loans, that’s some shady shit. But honestly just corporate greed and corruption rather than conspiracy imho.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s not really a conspiracy, but it’s still worth talking about. Hopefully we can fix the current system so that college can become more affordable for the future generations. As it is now, you better earn your way to a paid tuition or pick a degree that is going to produce enough money afterwards so you can pay off those nasty loans. My friend is in dental school and his loans are six figures, he’ll be able to pay them off quickly after college. There are a lot of art, gender studies, english, etc majors that are going to learn the hard way that their degree isn’t going to help them pay their loans back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately for the most part college isn&#39;t worth it unless you get a stem degree that will get you a decent job after, or you come from a wealthy family that would pay for it. Also where you go and your GPA has a lot to do with how worth it your degree is. Just manage to scrape by with your marketing degree from a no name school? Shit, was that even worth it? Should have went to trade school. Now there are completely made up and worthless degrees, pseudosciences. If you do want to go to school try and get into the best programs you can at the best universities you get accepted into. Don&#39;t go into school blind either, you need to have your mind set in something specific that you&#39;ve looked into before. I know people that did a few semesters as &quot;undeclared&quot; majors that just dropped out and have nothing to show for it besides debt. Don&#39;t let schools or guidance counselors trick you into going to school if it isn&#39;t right for you. You&#39;re the schools customer after all and they love your tuition money. YouTube and khan academy are great options to learn a lot for free </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a conspiracy but the best scam of all time.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The cost of college has outpaced inflation (I think), public and private student loans are easily available from many sources *and* you can&#39;t erase them with Bankruptcy.  The average US student finishes with about 30k-50k in student loans, which isn&#39;t very much is you have a solid budget and marketable degree.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The problem comes in when we market the idea that  &quot;A bachelor&#39;s is the new HS diploma!&quot; and push every young adult to get their masters right away, even if they can&#39;t afford it. If you were able to finish your bachelors with under 10k or no debt, great! Get your masters if you see fit.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>If you didn&#39;t you&#39;re better off working and getting experience while waiting the next move. Sometimes, like for Accountant and Finance majors, an MBA really isn&#39;t necessary. However, there are professions, like lawyers, engineers, scientist, doctors where a Masters or above is expected...and thats expensive.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>So you rack up all this debt, to get your masters, and now life gets in the way...Mortages, car loans, medical bills from an accident, 100k+ in student loans, wedding costs, etc.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>What use is you Masters if your making 100k in loans but have a total of 300k+ in debt? You wanna have kids too? You&#39;re fucked.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>This is all part of the larger conspiracy to keep as many people in debt. When you&#39;re in debt, youre a slave, the government or company can call back certain debts and have you screwed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At this point college is more of an intelligence test than anything else. People are so mindlessly programmed that they really can&#39;t step back to see the real picture: NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOUR DEGREES. I was friends with a guy who worked as a web designer at a dot com hosting company and as a grunt-worker at a billion dollar hedge fund. Not exactly the best jobs ever, but he was making decent money living in an expensive city. He had dropped out of Berkeley, but he just told everyone that he graduated. No one cared.</p>

<p>Hiring managers spend an average of six seconds viewing applicant resumes. Two of those seconds are spent looking at your school/degree. They can&#39;t be bothered to care about you. 80% of jobs are filled via social networking. Thinking that you need a college degree is incredibly regressive and out of touch now. </p>

<p>Modern education is designed to de-program your creativity and intuition. Do enough research and you will find plenty of articles and studies that show people are actually biased against creative thinkers.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting how there are certain jobs where we tell people, &quot;hey just figure it out somehow.&quot; These positions are NOT data driven. What are those? HR, Recruiting, Management, and Teaching. School was technically made obsolete with the advent of the television; yet you don&#39;t see hundreds of mathematics or literature channels on your TV, do you? This tells you that our culture does not value education in any way. It has to be MANDATED for the first 12 years. You have to crush a child&#39;s creativity for 12 whole years before they will submit to more voluntarily. Mandated education does not make sense in a free market society.</p>

<p>You can, however, go on YouTube to find those education channels. The bloat of universities is completely unnecessary from a technological perspective. But people are so obsessed with status that it is the only thing holding together the college education scam.</p>

<p>I think if you could create systems whereby people could display status in such a way that circumvented the education system then you might have competing models. The problem is with our priorities. 3 billion people are in poverty on this planet and we still see driving a beemer as success.</p>

<p>That isn&#39;t success. That means you failed the intelligence test. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not so much a conspiracy as just a plain old racket IMO. </p>

<p>Baby boomers put a lot of emphasis on the importance of getting a post secondary degree, so governments eased restrictions on lending money to their kids (keep in mind how risky it is to lend to someone with no job, nor a prospect of a job for possibly years to come!). Money flooded in, so existing institutions were able to raise their tuition fees, and for-profit schools popped up all over to take up the slack.</p>

<p>Lots of people made and are making lots of money here--not the least of which are banks who (at least in the US) lobbied successfully to make it impossible for students to avoid repaying student loan by declaring bankruptcy. </p>

<p>In the meantime the job market has become so flooded with degree holders, that the value of degrees has plummeted. Now a job a boomer might have gotten with one degree requires two or more.</p>

<p>Basically there was a bit of irrational exuberance surrounding the value of college degrees, and there were, and still are lots of people more than happy to take advantage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never considered myself a genius but before I started college I researched and calculated how much college would cost me and the median salary of an individual with my degree.</p>

<p>I worked while going to community college, applied for all available grants, and now soon I&#39;ll graduate debt free with an engineering degree.</p>

<p>I know people who never even bother to Google the median salary of a graduate with their degree and insist on going to an expensive out of state college.</p>

<p>Nobody made you go to college. There&#39;s no conspiracy. You just made a mistake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bro. Not going to Uni (that’s what it is here in Aus) was the best thing I ever did. I feel for Americans. College has been advertised and seen as an amazing time in all Hollywood movies. Revenge of the nerds, American Pie. The list goes on forever. I can’t help but think the drug, Sex, wild college reputation was put in those movies to suck every one in to mass debt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not everything you dislike is a conspiracy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible to wind up in this situation with a bunch of individual actors (universities, student loan companies, the federal and state governments in this case) to each be acting in their own individual best interests and still end up in this situation. It doesn&#39;t require all these groups to collude, so that&#39;s a far more likely explanation. (not saying it&#39;s impossible, just...unnecessary, so why would people put in the extra work?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The primary conspiracy of college is happening in public education. They teach you to learn at the barrel of a gun, and they exhaust your mental faculties at a young age, so much that in your free time its hard to focus on anything but mental rest and recreational and artistic hobbies.</p>

<p>Every bit of what you lean in college is available for free, and in better forms suiting your learning style all over the internet, except... your &quot;learning style&quot; is to learn only what you are told to learn for a prize... a good grade, a certificate and a couple ceremonies.</p>

<p>If you retained your drive to self-educate, you are better off than most, but you would be far better off if you were just left to your own devices during childhood. During summers and winter breaks I learned all the advanced concepts I use to make money.</p>

<p>If it wasn&#39;t for boredom on a farm, I wouldn&#39;t have had any skills by the time I graduated, but I learned enough to make a six figure salary on accident, because I wasn&#39;t in school ALL year.</p>

<p>THANK GOD that most of our country was still farming when public education was cemented into our system, or we would all be going to school 365 days a year, and I would not know how to self-educate. I would be FAR better at all the stuff I&#39;m interested in if I had never, ever set foot in a school. The idea that kids don&#39;t learn on their own is PLAUSIBLE, but for the vast majority of children, when put in a free situation, self-education comes pretty naturally.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a conspiracy to make you an obedient little worker... so obedient that you&#39;ll pay $100k or more, on loan, just to get into a marginal career, like you were taught to seek.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it is a scam, as they are backed by the Federal Govt. A private bank would not do student loans without the government backing. Too many students would not pay.</p>

<p>Government backing of student loans means the college in not in danger of you not paying your loan. This means they can increase the cost of college, and the type of degrees offered. If they increase the cost of attending, some students cannot attend. But having loans available means more can attend. A degree that has low income prospects would be less likely to be offered, as the person could not pay back the loan. But it the government backs the loan, the college will not be taking a loss on the degree. So if a degree has limited prospects of generating an income for you to pay off the debt, the government backing takes away all risk to the college.</p>

<p>A college conspiracy is why don&#39;t universities explain the basic economics of loans and government intervention in loans to students? Why is the average student not taught the basics of the #1 private expense for nearly everyone with a degree? The top two expenses after taxes are mortgage/rent and car payment. A major portion of federal taxes also goes to service the federal debt.</p>

<p>Mortgages are the same scam. It used to be, banks would get you a house loan for 5-10 years. You put 20% down, 5-10 years you own your house.</p>

<p>Then the government created the fake secondary market. The idea that was sold to the public was now more people can own their own home because the government would back the loan.</p>

<p>Well, who was backing the loan before? It was the borrower. The bank already gave out it&#39;s money. Now that the government backs it, the bank cannot lose. The secondary mortgage market was created to protect banks, not the average American.</p>

<p>The government buys the mortgage from the bank. The bank then has it&#39;s money back and can loan again. So the bank does many more loans in the same time period, as it doesn&#39;t have to wait 5-10 years to get it&#39;s money with interest back. Do you know what else? Now the bank can give out 30-40 year loans, because the government backs it. A loan is based off of your income. If you can pay $1000 a month on a loan, you can do it for 30 years as well as 10.</p>

<p>Further, the banks were willing to do 100% loans instead of 80% loans. Why not, the government backed it? In fact, they went to 140% loans. There was no real risk to the bank, if the government backed it. Also, normally you would have to document your income, so you could pay it back. But because the government backed it, you could just state your income. So you could get a 40 year loan with state income for 140% of the property price. The result was lots of fraud and a &quot;bubble&quot; in housing prices. </p>

<p>Also a nice feature: who to give a loan to? Someone with good credit, or bad? Answer: a bad credit loan makes more money if you are the bank. Why? You can charge a higher rate because they are more likely to default. But if they do default, the government will make it good, because the government backs it. You cannot lose if you are a bank.</p>

<p>Did the home ownership rates increase? No.</p>

<p>Housing prices rapidly increased. </p>

<p>Did the bank profits increase? They exploded!!</p>

<p>Did the government at least make money off the secondary mortgage market? No. They privatized Fannie Mae, so the profits were not available to the government, but to stockholders. </p>

<p>But when the rampant corruption and fraud threatened US banks, foreign banks, insurance companies, and the government founded corporations, the American taxpayer gets to bail them out. So the losses are public but the profits private.</p>

<p>Does anyone do anything about it? No. It is all perfectly legal. Has happened many times, and will happen again because you will not be taught this in a public school. Then you will know that the government lies to you and has been robbing the US public for generations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that it is something of a plot to negate the value of your of your education before you ever even apply for a job that you&#39;re going to be offered far less for than it&#39;s actually worth and that there are enough grads in that same predicament that you&#39;ll have no choice but to accept it. </p>

<p>The fact that they&#39;ve made that debt inescapable and that you cannot declare personal bankruptcy even though you are bankrupt and literally living in a state of bankruptcy due to the weight of that debt, is simply more evidence that that&#39;s probably the motive behind it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Former high school teacher here. The extreme push for college readiness and for everyone to go to college is on my list top 20 problems I have with public education. The college readiness thing starts in elementary school and doesn’t let up. Kids in middle school in some states are forced to choose their career path and their high school course offerings and schedules are dictated by that choice. I don’t know what you all wanted to be in 7th grade, but I have yet to go to outer space. There are programs designed to promote college readiness whose numbers are artificially inflated by adding kids to the program who don’t really meet the criteria. I could go on and on. </p>

<p>Not everyone needs to go to college. There’s nothing wrong with trade school. But go to any public school in our country and you’ll see every kid there being pushed to go to college. It’s a real problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>College spending is a holdover from pre-industrial times when a school was indeed difficult to reach (&quot;I walked barefoot in snow uphill both ways&quot;), teachers were scarce and knowledge was contained in just a couple cloistered university archives.

    <div class="md"><p>Why aren’t student loans 0% interest or at least &lt;1%? The banks got that courtesy after they crashed the economy and needed a bail out. </p>

<p>But instead we say “fuck you” to our students and hand them 4-7% interest rates on huge loans. That kind of debt is designed to be insurmountable. Student loans have created two generations of indentured servants and are now getting starting on a third.</p>

<p>This system is going to break eventually because people simply don’t have the money to pay.</p>
