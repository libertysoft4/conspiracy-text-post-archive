        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think one of the reasons people are drawn to the conspiracy culture/Truth movement is because of the rejection of both sides of the phony left/right paradigm. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Lately, ever since Trump was elected, it seems the opposition (Mainstream media, TMOR, controlled opposition agents like Alex Jones) has been portraying us as hardcore alt-right looneys and rabid supporters of the current administration. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Many of the more gullible and desperate CT&#39;s seemed to have been fooled by the election of a false prophet, Trojan Horse populist &quot;outsider&quot;. Everywhere you look, there&#39;s an attempt to make us appear racist, homophobic, sexist, and intolerant; all characteristics that are being pinned on the right as of late. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Perhaps it&#39;s an attempt to not only destroy the non partisan appeal that allows us to reach new minds and wake others to the false left/right dichotomy that keeps us divided and under control, but to also destroy any credibility we have with accusations of racism and jew hatred, sexism, all things that most human beings are highly sensitive to and critical of. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>I noticed that suspected controlled opposition agents like Alex Jones, who used to reject the two party system, suddenly &quot;flipped&quot; and started cheerleading for POTUS and leading their followers toward the conservative side of the spectrum. Perhaps this is to &quot;suck&quot; us into the political paradigm arena, ultimately rendering us useless, and generally creating more division and hostility between the population. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>This is 21st century warfare folks. They reinforce this with &quot;kook pools&quot; and rat-holes like Q anon and TheGreatAwakening to reinforce the large scale manipulation taking place, filling the followers with false hope and partisan bias. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>All I can say is, perhaps we need to continue to maintain a non-partisan appeal if we really want to reach more people.  </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>This is exactly what I&#39;m talking about ^</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>But that&#39;s only true if you still fall for the idea of him being anti-establishment. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Anti establishment presidents don&#39;t place Goldman Sachs and Bilderberg members and Rothschild bankers into their cabinet. They don&#39;t bomb countries under false pretenses, they don&#39;t continue the drone program, they don&#39;t authorize massive military spending bills, and they don&#39;t boast about bombing the middle east and taking the oil. </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>This election, in my opinion, worked out exactly as planned. A villain, and an underdog false prophet; Americans love a story like that, especially when they are so desperate for change.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ll interrupt to remind everyone if the sub is under attack then the attackers will generally blow smoke and rearrange vote counts so that the less irrelevant or more dangerous comments will be less visible or even invisible. So consider this - what would it take for the real world to actually produce the effects we have seen here particularly since the 2016 debacle?</p>

<p>My guess is that “they” are constantly scrambling to protect the secret programs that still need to stay secret. Many don’t and are being phased into semi-secrets like ufos and geoengineering. My guess is that many other secrets that might connect with those two (tell me if you can think of any) are in danger of coming out prematurely. If that was the case then I think we would indeed see some bizarre effects in this sub, and other discussion nodes as well.</p>

<p>I heard the establishment media, today, refer to itself as the establishment media. They are - by my eye - <em>against</em> him.  </p>

<p>I remember the bombing of an airfield and for the first time he was publicly praised by the war mongers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t know how many of those are fake posts from trolls who want something to make fun of us for though. Then there are the regular trolls who have no connection to the anti-conspiracy subs. They post here for fun.</p>

<p>Joshua Ryne Goldberg is an interesting character. He was a Jewish American who wrote neo-nazi articles, posted anti-semitic stuff to Reddit, and a whole bunch of other things. He wrote an article for the Daily Stormer, a neo nazi website, that claimed &quot;<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a fertile ground for recruitment.&quot; His alias was Michael Slay. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On online forums Reddit and 4chan, under the name European88, he uploaded thousands of anti-semitic and racist posts as a neo-Nazi, and on the specialty neo-Nazi site Daily Stormer, he his alter-ego Michael Slay did the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/joshua-goldberg-the-fake-aussie-jihadist-had-a-hand-in-every-online-fight-20150913-gjlc30.html">http://www.smh.com.au/national/joshua-goldberg-the-fake-aussie-jihadist-had-a-hand-in-every-online-fight-20150913-gjlc30.html</a></p>

<p>This is the article he wrote for Daily Stormer, which was used by so many people as &quot;proof&quot; this sub is targeted by white supremacists and nazis for recruitment:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/5EBcB">https://archive.is/5EBcB</a></p>

<p>There is another example I am aware of. See <a href="/u/interrogatorybunny">/u/interrogatorybunny</a>. He posted a bunch of obviously racist stuff to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. But his second post had proof he was actually a former <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> mod &quot;Bipolarbear0.&quot; This is one of his submissions: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/128s2h/i_noticed_this_today_while_browsing_reddit_seem/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/128s2h/i_noticed_this_today_while_browsing_reddit_seem/</a></p>

<p>If you see the image he posted, it says right on there &quot;bipolarbear0.&quot; Under his moderator account, he was very anti-conspiracy, but then he posts racist stuff to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

<p>I obviously don&#39;t know what generation you&#39;re referring to but it seems to me that things we were all shouting about years ago as conspiracies tend to get revealed in ways that somehow don&#39;t trigger the common person to turn skeptical about all the other flimsy explanations they&#39;ve been getting for years. I don&#39;t understand it and I&#39;ve given up trying. You can&#39;t learn what you don&#39;t want to know.</p>

<p>The partisan types show up here and focus on whatever confirms their bias. I don&#39;t think we&#39;re doing any better or worse at changing anyone&#39;s mind with information or debate. It&#39;s just a hard thing to do. They have to change it themselves when something in their world forces a re-evaluation. Then they find their way here while looking for explanations.</p>

<p>As generations pass, what once wasn&#39;t provable can be proven and what was once fact becomes primitive. Unfortunately it works in reverse too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Donald Trump became the nominee because Republicans set up the primaries to assure he would win, by diluting the field with too many candidates. Then, they branded him an outsider and got some of the most hated Republican insiders to support Hillary. </p>

<p>They also pumped up how much DJT and GWB &quot;hate&quot; each other.</p>

<p>After all that, DJT gets in using establishment Republican voter suppression, and pursues a nearly perfect GWB policy agenda. Republicans complain constantly about how terrible DJT is, but they never actually do anything to stop him. </p>

<p>At the same time, DJT brings in GWB&#39;s buddies, promotes GWB&#39;s space force, breaks the Iran deal as per the GWB plan, and installs Koch brothers lackies onto the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Anyone still claiming that Trump is fighting TPTB is not credible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we agree. I think. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is that I think some posters here really <strong>are</strong> right-wing partisans or really <strong>are</strong> white supremacists or really <strong>are</strong> sympathetic to those beliefs, <strong>and that there&#39;s a lot more of them lately.</strong> </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think these are astro-turfers trying to &quot;discredit&quot; r/conspiracy when they post this stuff.  I&#39;m not sure there is an &quot;attack on our non-partisan appeal&quot; from the outside.  I think many right-leaning people have naturally found the sub during and since the US election in 2016 and they are wrecking it with partisan posts. In other words, the only people &quot;portraying truth seekers as Trump supporters&quot; <strong>are the actual Trump-supporting truth seekers that have inundated our once great sub-reddit.</strong></p>

<p>Why is the opposition trying so hard to paint this culture/community as conservative/Alt-Right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it&#39;s full of right-wing fake news. Literally brimming with it. Whenever right wing fake news comes out, it&#39;s immediately one of the first places you see it in. </p>

<p>It&#39;s noticeable as fuck when conspiracy communities suddenly start cheerleading the fucking executive branch, run 24/7 defense for it and pump out its talking points, oftentimes word for word. When the entire &quot;culture&quot; used to be ANTI-government, ANTI-big business, ANTI-war and ANTI-partisan worship.... It becomes REALLY noticeable when people start dick-riding the president, dick-riding his political allies and defending things like giant corporate tax cuts and other sweetheart deals for big business. Also, suddenly this community has a noticeable amount of people fucking defending ISRAEL of all country&#39;s. That in and of itself is noticeable as fuck.</p>

<p>The better question is this: why is <del>the opposition</del> the right wing going all in on infiltrating and manipulating conspiracy communities and hijacking their messaging?</p>

<p>accusations of racism and jew hatred</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is obviously not true among truth seekers.</p>

<p>In reality, we&#39;re against Israel and Zionism, who do <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> represent Judaism at all. They&#39;re trying to portray us as being &quot;anti-Semites&quot; and &quot;wanting another Hitler&quot;, and all that rubbish.</p>

<p>It&#39;s convenient for them, politically, though. And it&#39;s fucked. They&#39;ve even gone so far as to attack other Jews who don&#39;t agree with Israel or Zionism. Which paints them for what they really are ~ a political hijacking of Judaism, so that they can abuse its victim status.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m not incorrect... Judaism was hijacked centuries ago. Oh, it probably broke free of the influence of corrupt Rabbis, but was then captured again.</p>

<p>I feel sorry for all the non-Zionist Jews caught up in this Zionist shit-storm. :/</p>

<p>That being said, Trump has his own brand of manipulation, appearing as a &quot;down to earth&quot; everyman to his supporters. It definitely works on them, and they need to get their shit together and realize he truly does not give a single fuck about any of them. How hard is it to understand that presidents are corporate frontmen?</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is political, as you know.</p>

<p>Conspiracies are everywhere. They involve groups of people who are willing to do anything for power and profit. The media is a conspiracy cesspit. Politicians are a bunch of crooks and liars. Corporations are raping the Earth and every person on it. On all these issues, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has the balls to name names and dig up the truth of who is behind the skulduggery.</p>

<p>In my experience, conservatives largely know all this, and they only differ from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> in that they don&#39;t put forth the effort to research the specifics. They are also inveterate flag wavers, so they are blind to any conspiracy that tarnishes the red, white and blue... but it&#39;s a FUCK TON easier to paint us as a bunch of conservatives than it is to paint us as a bunch of liberals.</p>

<p>Liberals want to hand all the keys and passwords to a cabal who promises to fix everything, and that SURE AS SHIT isn&#39;t us. Liberals are globalists, largely, even the sincere ones like Jimmy Dore. Conservatives are into small government, and they distrust power. DING, DING, DING!!! That&#39;s us, unless you get into far more depth than Sean Hannity or Anderson Cooper are ever likely to dig.</p>

<p>Conservative politicians promise small government and then they stab their base in the back, but the mainstream conservative is absolutely mind-blended by what is happening in the world right now. Conservatives are largely coming to terms with a slew of conspiracy theories, although a large number of them are just beyond their ability to accept.</p>

<p>But, yeah.. if your&#39;e going to DIVIDE AND CONQUER, you have to paint EVERY group as far left or far right, and then they are easier to attack. Donald Trump is kind of a conspiracy theorist, despite his numerous flaws, and so that reinforces the ease with which we are painted as radical right wingers.</p>

<p>I think all this is obvious to anyone who has been here for years.</p>

<p>Much love.</p>
