<p>But if you look at the bookies Pence was listed at 2-to-3 odds. <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/09/05/bookies-place-odds-on-anonymous-white-house-official/">https://nypost.com/2018/09/05/bookies-place-odds-on-anonymous-white-house-official/</a></p>

<p>I propose a friendly wager where those that guess wrong have to add a line at the bottom to every comment or post for like a day or 2. That line could be something like &quot;I&#39;m a dummy and guessed wrong&quot;. </p>

<p>What do you guys think?  </p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong. There are <strong><em>bright spots</em></strong> that the near-ceaseless negative coverage of the administration fails to capture: effective deregulation, historic tax reform, a <strong><em>more robust military</em></strong> and more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[... War Monger Detected ...]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Take foreign policy: In public and in private, President Trump shows a preference for autocrats and dictators, such as <strong><em>President Vladimir Putin of Russia</em></strong> and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and displays little genuine appreciation for the ties that bind us to allied, <strong><em>like-minded nations</em></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[... Clear reference to Israel ...]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Astute observers have noted, though, that the rest of the administration is operating on another track, one where <strong><em>countries like Russia are called out for meddling and punished accordingly</em></strong>, and where <strong><em>allies</em></strong> around the world are engaged as peers rather than ridiculed as rivals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[... Israel&#39;s &quot;meddling&quot; is ignored ...]</p>

<hr/>

<p>Don&#39;t discount the possibility that Bolton may be in on this.</p>

<p>The goal could be to try to coerce Trump into reigniting US intervention in Syria -- and then on to Iran -- which he may be reluctant to do.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what Bolton and his bosses in Israel want. No question about that.</p>
