<hr/>

<p>I recently had an opportunity to visit the Mayan site of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamanai">Lamanai</a> in Belize. This ancient site was spectacular and surprising. </p>

<p><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/JvEgFMdVr6v">https://goo.gl/maps/JvEgFMdVr6v</a></p>

<p>The hiking wasn&#39;t too bad. I was able to see the Temple of the Jaguar, The Mask Temple. I also got a chance to climb to the top of The High Temple.</p>

<p>I learned that most of the original temples were covered over with &#39;accurate&#39; representations of statues and walkways. They did this to prevent damage from today&#39;s tourists. </p>

<p>One of the few places still in its&#39; original condition was The Royal Ball Court:</p>

<p><a href="http://people.uncw.edu/simmonss/Lamanai%20ballcourt.JPG">http://people.uncw.edu/simmonss/Lamanai%20ballcourt.JPG</a></p>

<p>This is where the archaeologist shared his perspective.</p>

<hr/>

<p>He reminded us that what we often &#39;know&#39; or read about ancient sites is built on assumptions that mislead and obscure the truth.</p>

<p>The truth is that there is a lot we don&#39;t know. And there are many things we know that are completely false.</p>

<p>The image of the ball court found above may have triggered a memory, or a story you heard about this game that was played back in the day. You may have heard that the game was played with hoops attached to the outer walls, where points were scored. You may have heard that the winning team was often sacrificed to the Gods. </p>

<p>This archaeologist assured me that there has never been a single piece of evidence to suggest how the game was played or what happened to the players following a win or a loss.</p>

<p>A few people made assumptions and their story became &#39;HISTORY&#39;. </p>

<hr/>

<p>He told us a story, from a different site, where they found a short tunnel that led to an underground pool next to some hand carved stairs. The bottom stair was worn away from use. Assumptions were made that there must have been an ancient foot-washing station next to the pool. People sat on the stairs and had their feet washed which led to the wear and tear they were seeing on the bottom step. This theory was accepted immediately and with the new information the culture of the people was adapted to house this new data.</p>

<p>You are probably guessing at this point, but YES, they were WRONG.</p>

<p>After many years, another worker at the site noticed something very strange. A few times a day, a local bird was going into the area with the underground pool. The bird was taking local tree nuts and smashing them on the worn away rock. This behavior, over time, was most likely responsible for the weathering. </p>

<p>The archaeologist explained that while they had most likely found the easiest explanation, it was too late. Books had been written, theories had been proposed and a generation of people were now teaching inaccuracies. He said that this pool and rock had been discovered in the 1970&#39;s. Forty years later and he still hears the misinformation being shared. </p>

<hr/>

<p>What other theories, or stories, from ancient sites have we gotten completely wrong?</p>

<p>The most aggressive ones are those with lots of schooling/education in history. They think they know the truth because they studied it for years. I know a few history majors like this. They are able to recite all kinds of dates and other data through their required rote memorization, but if you bring up anything that goes against their schooling, they write it off without a second thought, because anything that threatens the foundation of their memorized facts must be preposterous.</p>

<p>Something in &#39;Mesopotamia&#39;, if brought to public consciousness, would blow the shit out of the whole Abrahamic Fairytale Narrative.

<p>I think there&#39;s a potential for cognitive dissonance on both sides. The point being that we, outside of available evidence, do not know. The issue may be that the theories you&#39;re inclined toward are deemed less respectable than the others, although those theories are often only different interpretations of the same evidence. </p>

<p>I really dislike citations. Always felt it&#39;s more of an ego stroke than important to process of discovery. That said, when trying to counter theories/interpretations, you&#39;re not dealing with empirical evidence. You&#39;re dealing with one person or groups interpretation of that evidence.</p>

<p>What you&#39;re describing is a problem with the popularization/sensationalism of science, not the science itself. The people doing the actual research should be (and usually are) cautious in their interpretations and always open for reexamination if new data emerges.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right, but it is a silly point to make. Of course, not only science, but everything in human experience apparently rests upon fundamental assumptions of causality, consistency in universal rules, etc. Without them the very concept of knowledge would seem ridiculous. No one but a few ontology philosophers spends too much time thinking about these things, they are indeed taken for granted because we would descend into madness if we had to doubt our reality every second of our existence.</p>

<p>I think the word assumption carries with it a lot of negative connotations for many people (i.e. that an assumption is a careless mistake), and the preferred word would instead be hypothesis (a proposal aware of its uncertain nature, with the intent to be systematically tested).</p>

<p>The problem of archeology, anthropology and history is that they often present their assumptions as facts, rather than theories. The amount of unsubstantiated extrapolations and fanciful assumptions is astounding the further back you look. They are not &quot;hard&quot; sciences where most things can be experimentally tested and replicated with any consistency so we can have a sufficient degree of confidence on their reality. They&#39;re often making crazy stories of how a people must have lived, what they believed in, etc based on a few pottery fragments and eroded building foundations... passing them as facts instead of saying &quot;we basically know nothing&quot;.</p>

<p><em>In April 1991, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) halted publication of its Eating Right Pyramid,</em> <strong><em>due to objections raised by meat and dairy lobbying groups concerning the guide’s display of their products.</em></strong> <em>Despite the USDA’s explanations that the guide required further research and testing, it was not until one year later—after its content was supported by additional research—that the Eating Right Pyramid was officially released.

<p>Maybe, maybe not.  In some cases certainly.  In some cases, traces will be left that can be analyzed.  That&#39;s how we know, for example, that most medeival castles were painted with a whitewash, and not bare stone as we see today.  In rare cases, depending on the quality of the soil in which they were preserved, more than traces may be left behind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Roman and Greek ruins are much more legit. We have sketches documenting the condition of buildings like the Colosseum (built 72 AD) going back  hundreds of years. The Parthenon (Ancient Greece, much older, built circa 450 BC) was actually in pretty good condition (very well constructed, it was nearly fully roofed still) until right before the 18th century. The Turks were using it to store fucking ammunition’s and the Venetians hit it with artillery. That’s when it blew apart. </p>

<h2></h2>

<p>A lot of Aztec and Mayan ruins are actually much younger (1200 AD+) and we’re in really bad shape until recently. Harsher climate, generally. Most have  been largely reconstructed recently. There are some small original structures in the jungle. </p>

<p>No electron was ever found. Because there is no such thing.
Magnetism is not understood and no explanations are available even today.
Gravity is not an explanation. It is merely a name. Why does the apple fall? &quot;Gravity, dumbass. F= ma&quot;.  Oh thanks, that clears it up. 
The photon is a &quot;particle and a wave&quot;? I dont know,  i think... &quot;shut up! The greatest genius ever to live won a Noble prize for the photo electric effect. His name was einstein and I&#39;m sure that your intellect isnt even half of his.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>Great write up. Primary school always made it seem like we were just a couple of questions away from understanding everything in the universe. Got a little more education and started realizing we don&#39;t know a goddamned thing about our world. </p>

<p>From genetics to astrophysics to human evolution, brain function, weather patterns, ecology, you name it, we are just pulling our heads out of our arses. Archaelogy is notable for exactly the assumptions you maintain.</p>

<p>So much of our understanding of older civilizations is based on colonial-European &quot;truths&quot; about the limited mind of the savage. There&#39;s no way they could&#39;ve had a written language...etc. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until I started looking into the &quot;Olmec heads&quot; that I realized the term &quot;Olmec&quot; was made up by the people who first found the heads--not the people who made them. No one knows what those people called themselves. This pattern of assumption-to-knowledge happens constantly. Thanks for the check.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, I get that there&#39;s a limit to the complexity you can teach any given age. My intent is to point out that even adults were convinced of the certainty of the universe not that long ago.

<p>We&#39;re in the tail end of that reconciliation, IMO. So yes, for sure we&#39;re taught with a different attitude about the world when we&#39;re young. I just meant it in a broader way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The first use of the term &quot;Byzantine&quot; to label the later years of the Roman Empire was in 1557, when the German historian Hieronymus Wolf published his work Corpus Historiæ Byzantinæ, a collection of historical sources. The term comes from &quot;Byzantium&quot;, the name of the city of Constantinople before it became Constantine&#39;s capital. This older name of the city would rarely be used from this point onward except in historical or poetic contexts. The publication in 1648 of the Byzantine du Louvre (Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae), and in 1680 of Du Cange&#39;s Historia Byzantina further popularised the use of &quot;Byzantine&quot; among French authors, such as Montesquieu.[10] However, it was not until the mid-19th century that the term came into general use in the Western world.[11]</p>

<p>The Byzantine Empire was known to its inhabitants as the &quot;Roman Empire&quot;, the &quot;Empire of the Romans&quot; (Latin: Imperium Romanum, Imperium Romanorum; Greek: Βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων Basileia tōn Rhōmaiōn, Ἀρχὴ τῶν Ῥωμαίων Archē tōn Rhōmaiōn), &quot;Romania&quot; (Latin: Romania; Greek: Ῥωμανία Rhōmania),[n 1] the &quot;Roman Republic&quot; (Latin: Res Publica Romana; Greek: Πολιτεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων Politeia tōn Rhōmaiōn), &quot;Graecia&quot; (Greek: Γραικία),[14] and also as &quot;Rhōmais&quot; (Greek: Ῥωμαΐς).[15] The inhabitants called themselves Romaioi and Graikoi,[16] and even as late as the 19th century Greeks typically referred to modern Greek as Romaika and Graikika.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I took an archaeology class and that was the biggest lesson I drew from that class.   Most of our education regarding history is taught as indisputable fact instead of the crafted story it really is.  Events close to us are generally well known because we have plenty of writings to tell us that the events did occur.  For history prior to the enlightenment, we can only rely on writings made by influential people backed up by circumstantial evidence.  Even then, the writings were created by people who often had incomplete pictures of events themselves and could have had motive to change descriptions of events.  The world leaders had a vested interest in shaping perceptions of their people.  It’s not unbelievable that they would alter records to meet their vision.  Likewise, artifacts can tell a story, but it’s a story created in your own mind, influenced by your own biases.  </p>

<p>If you’ve ever played Dark Souls, history is like the lore from those games, but even more ethereal and incomplete.  There is no telling what we might have gotten wrong.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a good post, and it&#39;s true.  </p>

<p>I study a lot of medieval history, British medieval history in particular, as a hobby.  Two of the most famous battles in British medieval history are The Battle of Hastings, which sealed the Norman Conquest of England, and The Battle of Bosworth Field, which ended the Wars of the Roses.  Both battlefields are historical landmarks in England today.  There are actually reenactments of the Battle of Bosworth Field done yearly on the site where it is said to have taken place.  The problem is, both sites are probably wrong.  Recent archeology (within the past 20 years) has discovered that the Battle of Hastings likely took place several hundred meters away from where the historic battlefield is and is underneath a roundabout today.  It&#39;s also taught that Harold Godwinson, King of the Anglo-Saxons, died at the battle after being shot in the eye with an arrow.  He may have been.  There is some evidence to support that theory.  However, it&#39;s not nearly as certain as many history books and documentary shows make it out to be.  There is other evidence which claims that he was killed by a thrown spear or javelin, yet other evidence that claims he was hacked up by four knights using swords, and other evidence that claims he died after being trampled by horses.  It&#39;s really not known how King Harold died, but the arrow through the eye is the best story, so that&#39;s the one that has been passed down.  </p>

<p>The Battle of Bosworth Field almost certainly happened about two miles Southwest from where the historical site says it did.  It&#39;s under a farm today.  King Richard III, who lost and died at the battle, has been historically depicted, most famously by William Shakespeare, as being a shriveled and deformed hunchback.  This depiction went mostly unchallenged for several hundred years.  Later historians and scholars began to debate this idea though.  The victor of the battle, Henry Tudor, who became King Henry VII, a lot like Donald Trump today, had a habit of blaming everything wrong in his country on the previous administration, and many scholars argued that the depiction of Richard III was wrong, that he wasn&#39;t a deformed hunchback, that he was competely normal, and that the depiction was just a bit of propaganda by the Tudors to make him appear and seem more evil and sinful.  The debate wasn&#39;t settled until 2012, when Richard III&#39;s grave was discovered underneath a parking lot.  The truth is that Richard III had extreme scoliosis or curvature of the spine.  He wasn&#39;t a hunchback, but he wasn&#39;t completely normal either, and the historical depiction was more of an exaggeration than an invention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do notice that the number of sources decreases the farther back you go. That&#39;s not surprising if you think about it, but we don&#39;t think often about it and the effects are what you describe. It&#39;s scary really how incomplete our understanding is. </p>

<p>E.g take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus">Josephus</a>, his name pops up all over ancient history and his word is rarely challenged. Our entire worldview is built on what happened in one small part of the world thousands of years ago, and a lot of it has only Josephus as a source. </p>

<p>Or what about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Carter">Howard Carter</a>, he was dynamiting his way through Egypt&#39;s ancient history on excavation missions that were basically wholesale looting. We take his word on a lot of things too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you assume scientifically the nature of how some bones and ruins are found underground? There is no experiment to do there. You just look at things and compare them to already known (and just as assumed) things and make new assumptions. Nothing scientific there. Just applying of basic logic into very vague things.</p>

<p>I think this is a common problem all around. Feelings of entitlement due to education and experience. Sometimes, it&#39;s true, but it was a common theme when studying early psychology too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right, but it is a silly point to make. Of course, not only science, but everything in human experience apparently rests upon fundamental assumptions of causality, consistency in universal rules, etc. Without them the very concept of knowledge would seem ridiculous. No one but a few ontology philosophers spends too much time thinking about these things, they are indeed taken for granted because we would descend into madness if we had to doubt our reality every second of our existence.</p>

<p>I think the word assumption carries with it a lot of negative connotations for many people (i.e. that an assumption is a careless mistake), and the preferred word would instead be hypothesis (a proposal aware of its uncertain nature, with the intent to be systematically tested).</p>

<p>The problem of archeology, anthropology and history is that they often present their assumptions as facts, rather than theories. The amount of unsubstantiated extrapolations and fanciful assumptions is astounding the further back you look. They are not &quot;hard&quot; sciences where most things can be experimentally tested and replicated with any consistency so we can have a sufficient degree of confidence on their reality. They&#39;re often making crazy stories of how a people must have lived, what they believed in, etc based on a few pottery fragments and eroded building foundations... passing them as facts instead of saying &quot;we basically know nothing&quot;.</p>
