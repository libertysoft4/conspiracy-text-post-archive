        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The U.S. National Security Agency spied on and intercepted the phone calls of Princess Diana right until she died in a Paris car crash with Dodi Fayed in 1997. The NSA currently holds 1,056 pages of classified information about Princess Diana, which has been classified as top secret &quot;because their disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security ... the damage would be caused not by the information about Diana, but because the documents would disclose &#39;sources and methods&#39; of U.S. intelligence gathering&quot;.[58] An official insisted that &quot;the references to Diana in intercepted conversations were &#39;incidental&#39;,&quot; and she was never a &#39;target&#39; of the NSA eavesdropping.[58]</p>

<p>U.K. agents monitored the conversations of the 7th Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan.[59][60]
U.S. agents gathered &quot;detailed biometric information&quot; on the 8th Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-Moon.[61][62]
In the early 1990s, the U.S. National Security Agency intercepted the communications between the European aerospace company Airbus and the Saudi Arabian national airline. In 1994, Airbus lost a $6 billion contract with Saudi Arabia after the NSA, acting as a whistleblower, reported that Airbus officials had been bribing Saudi officials to secure the contract.[63] As a result, the American aerospace company McDonnell Douglas (now part of Boeing) won the multibillion-dollar contract instead of Airbus.[64]</p>

<p>The American defense contractor Raytheon won a US$1.3 billion contract with the Government of Brazil to monitor the Amazon rainforest after the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), acting as a whistleblower, reported that Raytheon&#39;s French competitor Thomson-Alcatel had been paying bribes to get the contract.[65]</p>

<p>In order to boost America&#39;s position in trade negotiations with the then Japanese Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, in 1995 the CIA eavesdropped on the conversations between Japanese bureaucrats and executives of car manufacturers Toyota and Nissan.</p>

<p>What was new in 2013 that wasn&#39;t leaked previously?   That NSA cracks Google and Yahoo data center links?</p>

Our movements are now being tracked like never before.    I guess its time for a bunch of new revelations,   but the media would not report it this time.</p>

<p>It was huge news at the time.    But it was still lying.   The NSA was already more than a decade into the practice of wholesale data gathering on US citizens,   a practice that it was trying to cover up,  and US politicians were helping them to cover it up,  as was the media.</p>

<p>Average Joe was effectively complicit in being dupped,   but was still being dupped.    It was never that technically complicated.   The only part technically difficult to comprehend was the scale.   Until you look at the size and budget of the NSA.</p>
