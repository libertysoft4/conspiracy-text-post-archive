        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I feel like having Trump put in place has basically guaranteed that no matter who he comes up against in the next election is basically guaranteed a decisive victory, most likely 2 terms, while also setting the precedent to keep anyone without a political background out of the White House for the foreseeable future. It will also bolster the next Presidents resume undoing everything Trump has done to bring the US downwards compared to taking the reigns from the a traditional President, making their Presidential impact upon taking office seem bigger than it actually is. Just my 2 cents. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What country are you from? A lot of people who voted for him still like him. I don’t mean the hate crap or the edited videos, but he doing or at least trying to do what he said he would do. The people who he promised he’d help, he is helping. He knew exactly who to market to and he went at it full force. There are a lot of people in the states who identified with what he said and what he promised. Clinton did what she thought would sound good. It was rigged for her to win. It should have been sanders vs trump and I think it would have been close (not a sanders supporter). I think he’ll win again, I really do. People who voted for him will vote for him again over a far left democrat. Well I don’t know because a lot of sanders supporters voted for trump because they felt betrayed by the dem party after he lost to her. Idk I’m not an expert but that’s how people feel. </p>

<p>Unless of course the democrats run a credible left-wing alternative. In case of Sanders vs. Trump Sanders would have won, because the blue collars would have been inaccesible for Trump. In 2020 Sanders has slightly less chance, because Trump has shown he backs the talk with actions, but Sanders is not without chance there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. They voted for Trump in large part because of his stance on trade, which was the same as Sanders&#39; stance on trade. The rest of Sanders&#39; programme was way better for them than the republican-light programme of Trump. But trade was the breaking point with regards to Clinton and Sanders had that.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll go even further, Clinton with Sanders as VP would have easily won as well, for the same reasons, more or less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t necessarily agree, I know a lot of blue collar people who were always on the trump train. But I do agree sanders and trump had similar views and talking points for many things (I didn’t research sanders stances because I was automatically turned off by him being so far left, which may not even be true, but that was my thinking at the time). 
You may be right that Clinton would have won with him as the vp. Did he ask and he denied her? Or was she too stupid to ask? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. They voted for Trump in large part because of his stance on trade, which was the same as Sanders&#39; stance on trade. The rest of Sanders&#39; programme was way better for them than the republican-light programme of Trump. But trade was the breaking point with regards to Clinton and Sanders had that.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll go even further, Clinton with Sanders as VP would have easily won as well, for the same reasons, more or less.</p>
