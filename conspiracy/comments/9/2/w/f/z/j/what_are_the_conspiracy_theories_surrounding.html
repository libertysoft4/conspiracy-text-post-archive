    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a bunch of references to Jack&#39;s alcoholism and the son&#39;s &quot;accident&quot; which I interpret as Jack at the least beating his son badly, if not abusing him sexually. Then there&#39;s a weird vision type scene in one of the rooms where a man in a suit is sitting on the bed with another man dressed as a bear or some sort of animal kneeling in front of him. If you Google it there are breakdowns and interpretations of the scene and how the shot is framed similarly to other scenes featuring the son. Its Kubrick so people have picked apart every frame, some of it is compelling and other details seem a stretch. </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve never seen Room 237 it&#39;s a cool documentary that breaks down a ton of interpretations of The Shining. </p>

<p>In the book it&#39;s a bit different, referring to former guests of the hotel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is good info but all it takes is literally two seconds of critical thinking about the moon landing to realize that in 1969, the American public was fooled by Hollywood SFX before they became more well known to the public.</p>

<p>I.e. “the military has technology 20 years ahead of the population”</p>

<p>Why shouldn’t we believe the government had 1990 movie FX in 1969 and faked that shit.</p>

<p>Inb4 DURR my dad saw the rocket launch in Cape Canavarel</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean your dad saw it land on the moon. He saw it launch into the distance.. over the ocean... seems pretty easy to ya know, dump what you don’t need over the ocean and get ready for the landing charade when the astronauts “return home”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure he was the guy they went to whenever they needed to make a fake story in the media. If you&#39;ve ever seen the movie &#39;Wag the Dog&#39;, imo the movie producer character was definitely based on Stanley Kubrick. Essentially, the movie is about a presidential sex scandal right before the election, so they start a fake war with Albania and use the Stanley Kubrick character to film all of the fake war scenes and whatnot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the race had something to do with this conspiracy, USA was in space race against USSR, so the suggestion is USA fake the 1969 moon landing in order to claims victory over USSR for moon landing or something, because previously if I remember correctly USSR has won every previous test (won mean was first to succeed) such as first launch in space, first inhabited launch, etc. </p>

<p>So I personally believe that 1969 might be fake in order to win but then they managed to go there later on, that&#39;s my view.</p>

A thousand people can watch his something like e.g. The Shining and each see a different movie with different themes. Thus conspiratorial minded people will see that in his movies, because it&#39;s there. Then leave the invented universe of e.g. Eyes Wide Shut and project on to what they think is Kubrick&#39;s personal life (which they have no clue) what level they saw the movie at (e.g. Kubrick was killed by the elites he portrayed in the movie).</p>
