<p>We&#39;ve all heard about the Conspiracy Theory of <strong>Agenda 21</strong> &amp; <strong>Depopulation</strong>.</p>

<p>Most Climate Scientist even seem to push depopulation stating that humans are the cause of Climate Change &amp; Global Warming.</p>

<p>However, why would elites who are mostly <strong>Baby Boomers</strong> want depopulation when they&#39;re &quot;largest Age Cohort&quot;?</p>

<p>Why would they really want the younger crowd to lose all humanity?</p>

<p>Who&#39;s going to protect &amp; take care of them when they can&#39;t? Robots?</p>

<p>If they have children &amp; grandchildren who love them, and will take care of them &amp; protect them from monsters, then that&#39;s great.</p>

<p>If not, they&#39;re f$cked one way or another if &amp; when human life is no longer precious IMO.</p>

<p>The seeds we sow, will determine what we reap -- good or bad! </p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like all these Conspiracy Theories directed at <strong>elites</strong>, is trying to unite the masses to rally for another Bloody Revolution IMO.</p>

<p>Please leave your comments below &amp; I will add more details and a list of all the Depopulation Conspiracy Theories about Depopulation and the reasons behind it.</p>

<h1>Most of the World&#39;s Problems today stems from &quot;Excessive Greed&quot; IMO.</h1>

<p>Limiting excessive greed with solve most of the world&#39;s problems IMO.</p>

<p>I have created a &quot;<strong>WIN-WIN</strong>&quot; Model for the <strong>Next Golden Age</strong> that I think is a solution that everyone could agree with.</p>

<p><strong>The Next &quot;GOLDEN AGE&quot;</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those at the top of this planning and agenda picture a world where there are just enough real humans to keep this going, and the rest of their needs are served by AI – meaning, automation, robotics, and humanoids that are both biological and programmable on the DNA/consciousness level.</p>

<p>The real humans need to be culled dramatically for this to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would they care so much when they don&#39;t have much longer to live on Earth IMO. Do they think they&#39;re immortal or have drugs for immortality now only available to elites?</p>

<p>Also, why would true Artificial Intelligence go along with their plan? AI won&#39;t be greedy. AI won&#39;t love? If they&#39;re truly smart and rational, sure they may decide that depopulation makes sense to balance animals and humans. Or they may decide it&#39;s unfair for the 1% to own 50% and control 100% of the wealth by proxy.</p>

<p>I doubt AI will be like Humans.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also heard about the Conspiracy Theory for Adrenochrome Drug that the elites use. Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to have many expendable poor people continuously making expendable poor children for them to produce it on a continuous basis? If they can produce it artificially, why wouldn&#39;t they have already &amp; mass market it for mass profits?</p>

<p>Finally, how do the elites keep such a huge secret from the population? Are all elites monsters devoid of any real humanity in them?</p>

<p>Again, all these Conspiracy Theories seem to anger the masses -- the mob. When the mob is sufficiently angered enough, all hell&#39;s going to break lose &amp; they&#39;ll get lynched IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you think motivates them for such a reality? To save animals because they love animals so much? To save the planet before they die? Making more money? Buying hot girls? Buying fancy toys? Buying drugs? What would make them want that type of reality? Immortality in their own bodies or AI? Or travel to another planet or another dimension? What? WTF makes them tick? It can&#39;t be too much different than what makes you or I tick right?</p>

<p>I mean a world full of only elites &amp; AI can&#39;t be that much fun if they can&#39;t have any power &amp; control over each other on an equal &amp; level playing field right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That theory may hold ground if they actually experienced all the &quot;thrills&quot; that life offers today. In reality, they seem to live normal lives. Nothing too crazy other than having lots of wealth. In fact, they&#39;re all probably afraid to go anywhere without a security entourage tagging along. That is not freedom. They are not truly free. They also live in fear IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard of such Conspiracy Theories &amp; while there may be some that are like that, I doubt they all are. I can tell who the crazies are from the not crazies just by watching their speech &amp; body language.
The suspicious ones act suspiciously IMO.
And cannibalism? If there&#39;s no masses of humans they can exploit, who&#39;re they gonna eat then? Each other? Come on now.
I&#39;ve always wondered why they would be cannibals. That might be for another post though.
I&#39;ve heard of ancient tribes that practiced it but only to instill fear &amp; terror to their enemies.
It can&#39;t make them superior in any way genetically or nutritionally than what is already out there IMO. So then why do it? It makes no sense to me &amp; seems more like another Conspiracy Theory designed to create hostility &amp; anger towards the elites -- until one day they all get lynched by the angry mob.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Moloch is the biblical name of a Canaanite god associated with child sacrifice. However, the ancient Canaanites practiced this for protection &amp; good fortune.</p>

<p>Look in the modern region where Canaanite is located. They are in ruins like Syria. WTF would anyone half intelligent worship a god or deity that has no real power?</p>

<p>With regards to people who worship God zealously, look at them. Most of them seem to be people living with pain &amp; suffering of some kind. Most of them have no money &amp; have hardship, so they have hope &amp; faith in a better after life in Heaven. They do this because their life on Earth now is miserable IMO. Of course, there are many that love his teachings &amp; going to Church does instill good values in people IMO.</p>

<p>I wrote another Reddit post that makes more sense regarding the subject of Child Trafficking &amp; Sacrifice to produce Adrenochrome Drug.</p>

<p>&quot;Adrenochrome Drug&quot; is basically &quot;Adrenaline Rush&quot;

....You say you know zealots, but you dont seem to believe people can take God&#39;s word seriously, he mentions moloch directly, and they have thrived inside the elite underground cause their child sacrifice habbits also allow them to entrap politicians, its been going on since the roman times, if you pay attention you will see it, also you have a very mainstream media conception about Adrenochrome, you are missing the canibalism side of the elite </p>

I&#39;m sure there&#39;s lots of people who would sell their soul to the devil for wealth, fame &amp; fortune etc. But if it actually, worked, then why wouldn&#39;t everyone do the same?
Also, like I said Moloch&#39;s ancient proving grounds is a total &amp; utter failure. Who follows &amp; worships losers?</p>

The only thing that makes a little sense again is Adrenochrome Drug but even that is because they must not engage in anything healthy &amp; exciting in their lives that produced an &quot;Adrenaline Rush&quot; like playing sports IMO.</p>

Ok, I&#39;ve read that &quot;Adrenochrome&quot; could be like severe psychosis. So it makes sense that they would use it in Satanic Rituals for example. They would all probably hallucinate &amp; hear shit that makes them think they&#39;re talking with Satan himself! LOL ;p</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for chatting with me by the way. I do appreciate it.</p>

<p>It just seems very odd because only elites can&#39;t be involved. They have to use regular people in their operations too. People who have loving families &amp; friends -- even children.</p>

<p>This may explain the PTSD though, if regular people are involved &amp; can&#39;t get out for one reason or another.</p>

<p>Exponential population growth mathematically guarantees that we will reach peak oil production.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually rather simple.  Humanity created civilization once we entered the age of agriculture.  Agriculture allowed us to stay in the same area, but at the cost of hard work.  Eventually people realized it would be a lot easier to force others to work the fields, and this created physical slavery.  The problem with physical slavery is you need other guards to watch and force the slaves to continue being slaves, and the more slaves you have the need for more guards grows.  For example, if you had five slaves, you would only need one guard to watch these five.  If you got five more, you would need to hire two more guards, because watching ten slaves is much more difficult than watching five.  The more slaves means the more income and the more variety you can grow, but each guard wants money.  Eventually this system of physical slavery will collapse, as it will grow to a level where the income produced can&#39;t afford the cost of the guards.  So, the guards will eventually stop guarding the slaves, the slaves will revolt, and your whole empire will burn.  This is, in a nutshell, what happened to the Roman empire.</p>

<p>So, the powers that were at the time decided to change their policy.  They realized the only time the slaves were happy to have the guards was in times of war, so they split up families and created new cultures for the purpose of creating endless conflict.</p>

<p>Then we entered the age of industry.  Now more could be produced by less people, but the more people they had the more they could have.  The need for mass numbers of people were needed to continue the perpetual conditioning that government was needed and there for them.</p>

<p>And now we are in the age of technology.  With technology, one person can do the work of ten.  So, our leaders now find themselves at a crossroads.  They could use technology to finally free us.  Imagine a world where you would only have to do two hours of work a week, which would free up the rest of your time to do as you please.  In a generation or two, we would have a species of artists, scientists, and scholars.  This would raise us up to levels never believed possible, but at the cost of dropping them and their bloodlines down to our level.</p>

<p>One the other hand, they also could use technology to go back to physical enslavement.  They could then stop pretending, hiding, and place themselves again as royalty.  The only thing stopping them from this is they would need to get rid of about 90% of us.</p>

<p>By culling the herd down to 10% of what it currently is, they could easily use technology to force enough of us to perform ALL the work, while instilling a guard system to watch over us that would be affordable, and they would have ALL the time to do whatever they want.  They would create a paradise for them and theirs alone at the cost of Hell for the rest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This would raise us up to levels never believed possible, but at the cost of dropping them and their bloodlines down to our level. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there any scientific proof that their bloodlines are superior in any way other than having amassed excessive wealth over time &amp; generations?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see any &quot;elite&quot; super models, Olympic athletes, UFC champions, sports stars etc, etc. Maybe I&#39;m mistaken but most of them seem to have risen from humble backgrounds. Sure many from well education &amp; wealthy families but not billionaires, kings &amp; queens etc IMO.</p>

<p>Aren&#39;t they afraid of inbreeding? TBH, I&#39;ve never been attracted to &quot;elite&quot; women. I find many common girls way hotter, nicer personalities &amp; even more intelligent IMO.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They would create a paradise for them and theirs alone at the cost of Hell for the rest. </p>

<p>No one can live forever right? Or do you think they discovered the &quot;Secrets of Immortality&quot;?</p>

<p>History will always repeat itself, if the mistakes aren&#39;t learned from &amp; corrected. One day, their heirs will pay for their treachery IMO. Then history will remember them with Truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, thank you for such a elaborate &amp; rational comment trying to make sense of the Depopulation Agenda.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This would raise us up to levels never believed possible, but at the cost of dropping them and their bloodlines down to our level. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there any scientific proof that their bloodlines are superior in any way other than having amassed excessive wealth over time &amp; generations?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see any &quot;elite&quot; super models, Olympic athletes, UFC champions, sports stars etc, etc. Maybe I&#39;m mistaken but most of them seem to have risen from humble backgrounds. Sure many from well education &amp; wealthy families but not billionaires, kings &amp; queens etc IMO.</p>

<p>Aren&#39;t they afraid of inbreeding? TBH, I&#39;ve never been attracted to &quot;elite&quot; women. I find many common girls way hotter, nicer personalities &amp; even more intelligent IMO.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They would create a paradise for them and theirs alone at the cost of Hell for the rest. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one can live forever right? Or do you think they discovered the &quot;Secrets of Immortality&quot;?</p>

<p>History will always repeat itself, if the mistakes aren&#39;t learned from &amp; corrected. One day, their heirs will pay for their treachery IMO. Then history will remember them with Truth.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like Hitler. Would anyone else want to be remembered as Hitler? LOL 😜</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I look at Ancient Kings, Queens, Tribal Leaders etc, etc. Not only were they one of the most intelligent but they also lead their Guards &amp; Armies into battle. Many even rose to become leaders due to their prowess on the battlefield. Today, they can&#39;t even take one 1 of their guards in hand-to-hand combat IMO. LOL 😜</p>
