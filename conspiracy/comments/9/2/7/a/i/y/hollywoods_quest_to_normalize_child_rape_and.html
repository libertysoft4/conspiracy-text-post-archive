        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Hollywood has a paedophilia problem.</strong> Sexual exploitation and abuse of children is one Hollywood&#39;s darkest secrets. Public perception drives the industry. The image of powerful paedophiles controlling and running wild in Hollywood is bad for business.</p>

<p>The #MeToo movement was carefully steered toward sexual abuse of women. Studios, producers, lawyers, agents, public relations, and journalists all have a vested interest in hiding sexual abuse of minors and children. Hollywood has a history of protecting its own. Weinsten, Toback, Ratner, Spacey, and several other predators were recently sacrificed, but male sexual assaults and most of the paedophiles were protected from scrutiny.  Terry Crews has faced career consequences for standing up against a powerful male executive. Fox fired Bryan Singer, but his pool parties and diet of fresh twinks (underage boys) didn&#39;t get near as much attention as Weinstein. </p>

<p>Roseanne Barr was fired and blacklisted for one tweet in May 2018 and you&#39;d swear it was the Salem witch trials.</p>

<p>Hollywood is once again circling the wagons with a PR push of apologists, astroturfing, paid messaging, paid poll manipulation, and petitions to normalize and hide paedophilia in its quest to save James Gunn and Dan Harmon. </p>

<p><strong>What is paedophilia?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pedophilia, or paedophilia, is a psychiatric disorder in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children.[1][2]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Corey Haim and many other victims of Hollywood paedophiles rarely see justice, leading them to substance abuse or suicide. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McpjA-PqrKU">Corey Feldman can attest to this</a>. Haim was sexually abused as a minor, tossed out, and replaced by newer fresher twinks.  Haim ultimately committed suicide.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Feldman:</strong> I can tell you that the number one problem in Hollywood was, and is, and always will be paedophilia. That&#39;s the biggest problem, for children in this industry.</p>

<p>ABC: The casting couch even applies to children?</p>

<p><strong>Feldman:</strong> Oh yeah, not in the same way. It&#39;s all done under the radar</p>

<p>ABC: Nobody talks about paedophilia?</p>

<p><strong>Feldman:</strong> That&#39;s the big secret.</p>

<p>ABC: And it&#39;s widespread?</p>

<p><strong>Feldman:</strong> Oh yeah, I was surrounded by them when I was 14 years old. Surrounded, literally, and I didn&#39;t even know it. It wasn&#39;t until I was old enough to realize what they were and what they wanted and what they were about and the types of people that were surrounding me until I went oh my god they were everywhere like vultures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dan Harmon&#39;s simulated baby rape clip making the rounds is disturbing and will not age well (<a href="https://i.4pcdn.org/pol/1532293518224.webm">NSFW</a>). Harmon&#39;s full &quot;Daryl&quot; video as another Redditor stated, &quot;Dan Harmon deleted his Twitter account after releasing a video with an extremely offensive pedophelia joke. It makes the precursor Rick and Morty blowjob video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lpKx3FMNC4&amp;amp;t=33s">NSFW</a>) look tame in comparison.&quot;</p>

<p>James Gunn (52 years old) deleted over 10,000 tweets and his blog last Friday <a href="https://imgur.com/a/rvbDryr">many posts focused on child rape and sex acts involving children</a>, and even more tweets earlier today.  </p>

<p>Gunn was close friends with Huston Huddleston. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/06/man-who-saved-ncc-1701-d-touring-bridge-pleads-guilty-to-child-porn-charge/">Huston Huddleston was convicted of possession of child pornography</a> and recently sentenced. Here is a post from Gunn&#39;s blog which he tried and failed to scrub from the web during his rush to shutdown his blog on Friday.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120630045941/http:/www.jamesgunn.com/2010/09/20/video-100-pubescent-girls-touch-themselves/">Video: 100 Pubescent Girls Touch Themselves</a><br/>
jamesgunn.com - Sept 20, 2010</p>

<p>Huston Huddleston posted this video on my Facebook page<br/>
with the note “I thought you’d appreciate this.”<br/>
My response: <strong>“Appreciate it?!! I just came all over my own face!!”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Suddenly there&#39;s a fakeroots movement to save James Gunn claiming that all his tweets and blog posts were &quot;jokes.&quot; Reputation management teams are at work. Over the past few days there have been multiple attempts to deflect attention from paedophilia in Hollywood and sweep all this under the rug by blaming public awareness of Gunn&#39;s and Harmon&#39;s activity on a few people that post in r/the_donald.</p>

<p>So that makes normalization of child rape and paedophilia any less disturbing how??</p>

<p>Reddit users are noticing.</p>

<p>Untrue.  </p>

<p>Gunn normalized child rape, sexual abuse of children, and claimed to masturbate to prepubescent children over a period of years, both on Twitter and on his blog.  </p>

<p>This wasn&#39;t a one time event.  Gunn deleted over 10,000 tweets and his blog last Friday after being exposed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well my people found racist tweets by Roseanne and gave her a huge TV show, it wasn’t until she started tweeting terrible things AGAIN, while currently employed that she was fired. Disney knew about Gunn’s past, this actually came up before in 2014 but the power of the Pedo accusation hadn’t been discovered yet, and it wasn’t politically motivated so the outrage wasn’t artificially amplified, so it was treated as it should be. “Shock horror writer grows up and apologizes for filthy tweets.” There’s actual tweets from Cernovich justifying rape, but talk to me about Gunn’s jokes lol. 
Cernovich has justified rape repeatedly in his twitter, I’ll call for him to be held responsible for that, and don’t think a reputable company should hire him because he’s an actual rapist (I know he plead it down) and there’s an actual victim, and actual evidence and when he talks about rape on Twitter he’s not joking. It’s not because I don’t like his politics although that is true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it’s pretty amazing the still let Salva roam the streets, much less work in the film industry at all. Singer has had multiple accusers come forward and yet still gets work. I’m curious as to what those two have over the studio execs that look out for them. I’d imagine it’s a Weinstein type situation where they have blackmail on one or two of the major producers and leverage that to keep themselves afloat. If Cernovich and his team of internet rapscallions wanted to go on outrage campaign about those fuckwits that would be awesome. </p>

So Gunn could have indulged his sickness primarily with child porn- see his praise of his friend the child porn collector?   He may have done things to boys or girls afraid to speak up.  He could have convinced victims it&#39;s a special secret.  And sadly, some Hollywood parents would rather keep a false hope of stardom alive than get authorities involved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t really want to say this anywhere else, but if the posts had been jokes about rape, racism, or any number of other sensitive topics, people would have been pushing for his firing en masse. Why are the pedophilic jokes ok? Are they ok just for him, or are they okay for any person of influence in Hollywood? Why are the jokes not associated with rape if the legal age of consent is 18 where he lives and works? Would people interpret this situation differently if it were another individual at the locus of the scandal? The issue doesn&#39;t really seem to be whether or not he committed an actual crime; rather, the issue is why this particular subject matter is being given a pass and/or why this particular man is being given a pass. Why is this not considered predatory, violent rhetoric when other speech not involving a crime is cause for others&#39; career termination? At the very least, isn&#39;t censure justified? If a colleague repeatedly said these things to you and others (even in a creative work discipline, and especially after others had admonished him/her to stop), don&#39;t you think someone would complain to HR? Do you think it would make a difference if the person making the jokes was the company&#39;s VP or the mail clerk in the basement? </p>

<p>They&#39;re too fantastic (as in fantasy) to be taken seriously. Like any dead baby jokes people said years ago, no one actually thought the joke teller had a pile of dead babies and a pile of ball bearings and had to load them into a pickup truck with a pitchfork.</p>

<p>Racism is an actionable trend of hatred, jokes about raping specific people would not have been tolerated, etc. But saying Expendables made you want to fuck a pussy boy? That&#39;s a joke about mocking the &quot;tough guy&quot; image. Stupid, cringe-worthy joke, but clearly a joke.</p>

<p>Hey remember, when I called you out for being a fucking hypocrite and you stopped responding?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I stopped responding because:</p>

<ol>
<li>I have a life outside of reddit</li>
<li>you weren&#39;t actually reading my responses</li>
<li>you were pushing nonsensical replies over and over again</li>
</ol>

<p>It doesn&#39;t seem like you&#39;ve learned anything, because you&#39;re still pushing the same nonsense.</p>

<p>If you weren&#39;t aware, stalking users, and harassment is against site wide rules.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You never responded to my question, at all, because &#39;keep trolliing&#39; isn&#39;t an answer. Which I pointed out. It is neat to watch you do everything you can to avoid facing your hypocrisy though.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t- it&#39;s linked above for everyone to read and you won&#39;t link an answer because it doesn&#39;t exist. Keep running, you&#39;ll be safe from reality in the_donald.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it’s pretty amazing the still let Salva roam the streets, much less work in the film industry at all. Singer has had multiple accusers come forward and yet still gets work. I’m curious as to what those two have over the studio execs that look out for them. I’d imagine it’s a Weinstein type situation where they have blackmail on one or two of the major producers and leverage that to keep themselves afloat. If Cernovich and his team of internet rapscallions wanted to go on outrage campaign about those fuckwits that would be awesome. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you said “not even edgy comedians joke about pedophilia”. I’ve seen others make similar claims. But it’s like nobody remembers The Aristocrats movie, where ~100 comics tell the filthiest joke ever for over an hour. The movie came out in 2005, so it predates Twitter by a couple years, but it is proof that that kind of shock humor wasn’t uncommon back then. </p>
