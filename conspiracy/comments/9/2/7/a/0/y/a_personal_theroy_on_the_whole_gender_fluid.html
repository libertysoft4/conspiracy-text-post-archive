        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So this might come off as hateful/non tolerant etc etc. </p>

<p>I’ve been noticing a hell of a lot posts/videos/blogs and the like on people from the LGBT community about people using weird-ass pronouns. Like what in the actual fuck is a ‘xe’ or ‘gender fluid’ shit. I get the fact that some people feel like they are born as the other gender and they change it and everyone’s happy, same for gay folks. You’re a guy and like dicks? Great for you! You’re a girl and you like tits? Also great for you! </p>

<p>So where does the conspiracy come in you’re probably wondering. </p>

<p>The theory is (personal theory, could be bullshit for all I know, but in some ways it makes sense to me) that all of this new age, PC and feminized stuff is basically the goverments making people more submissive. The more estrogen there is and the more people are afraid to speak up against even the most ludacris bullshit. If you inject food with hormones to make it look better on shelves and everything, those same hormones get ingested by kids/adolescents who are the perfect targets for brainwashing into submissivness. Just check out the ‘discovery’ page on Snapchat or whatever it’s called and chances are, there’ll be at least one post or article regarding it and making sure to implant it into your thoughts. Titles like ‘Here’s why being gender fluid is actually great for you’ and the like make it the perfect clickbaity brainwashing stuff for kids in development who will then go on to grow up into adults with no backbone. Now another point I’d like to touch upon is that there’s a huge backlash on being a normal (including normal level testosterone) male that likes women, fuck all for some reason you’re automatically wrong and for some reason you should go gay because it’s the hot new thing! </p>

<p>All in all, my theory is that the goverment, ‘news’ sites and food companies are making sure the food and the media we ingest makes us more submissive to those in power. </p>

<p>Also sorry for the wall of text and rant, thank you all for a community that allows for expanding on ridicilous shit like this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The feminization of men is about control and submissiveness.  </p>

<p>The gender fluid pronouns nonsense is part “young person trying to be 2edgy4u”, and part enabling control by the government.  How?  Because by criminalizing an act based entirely on the subjective feelings of the accuser, it sets the stage for similar laws that can punish you by purely subjective criteria.  That’s scary as fuck.   </p>

<p>(Note, the majority of criminal laws are either entirely objective criteria that must be met for a conviction, or a mix of objective criteria with some subjectivity.  The difference is that the subjective criteria in this instances focuses on the accused’s intent where intent is an element of the offense, not on the alleged victim’s subjective feelings about the accused’s behavior).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree 100%!!! For example, look at the (a bit unrelated but still) stuff in the UK happening around ‘hate crimes’ for saying anything mildly offensive or in the moment to anyone of a different race/religion/sexual orientation. I mean fuck me, if someone runs into me with their car chances are I’ll yell out any obscenities that come to mind as a way to relieve stress/pain from the accident. And then somehow I’ll get a fine/jail time because of it? Nah fuck that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All laws are subjective bs. Legal discretion is nothing new.  But yeh, these liberal hate crimes are another ridiculous level to the police state.  Like,  i have the right to my sexuality, but I don&#39;t want the state bashing bigots on my behalf. I just don&#39;t want the state to bash me on the behalf of bigots. If bashing is inevitable, let&#39;s remove the state from the equation. But I don&#39;t think bashing is inevitable. Bashing is lazy and it doesn&#39;t resolve anything except violence as an authentic tool. Mutual respect and understanding comes from communication. Not bashing. </p>

<p>If the state wanted to help us communicate, that&#39;s be agreeable. But apparently the state only know how to bash. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about the lifestyle they could be sold. As people are growing older and this new gen is coming into light and wanting it to be normalized, they can sell women&#39;s clothing to males and vice versa. Think about also big pharma also, I doubt that people that identify or claim to be something else are not on medications. So theres 2 big things. Pharmaceuticals and clothing brands. We also have seen TV network stations are now leaning towards and accepting of individuals and now have a new audience. Think about social media catering also, drowning out someone else&#39;s values (shadow banning people voices) and only catering to people that think that way. I just feel that people in that community are being taken advantage of and being used for monetary gain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy is just one of the many multi-faceted methods of population control plain and simple. Reducing the fertility rate and reducing the population. If you mutilate the reproductive organs you were born with you are then incapable of reproduction. Over time, the more popular this becomes, the more it reduces the population. Popularizing this to younger and younger audiences and creating pressure for people to label and declare their sexuality and their gender as early as possible intensifies this. This is probably going to be considered &#39;trans-phobic&#39; but the fundamental scientific fact is that changing the gender you were born into is impossible. You can take all the hormones and undergo as many surgeries as you want but you will still be biologically the gender you were born into until you die. You cant change your race just because you identify as a black person. You cant change your species because identify as a dolphin or a horse. If people want to do this that is their choice and they certainly shouldnt be hated or persecuted for their decision, I just wonder if they realize what they are getting into. Sometimes these things are just a phase, especially in the teen years. Now people are permanently altering their bodies and there&#39;s no turning back from that if the phase happens to pass at some point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one identifies as an attack helicopter, and pretending they do counts pretty clearly as having something against trans people.</p>

<p>The vast majority of trans people do not use experimental pronouns or proclaim to be a different gender.  That stuff is brought up by the right wing faaaar more than it organically appears, because they try to inflate the size of the LGBT population in order to scare people.  </p>

<p>While all this stuff gets framed as being a cry for attention, its really the opposite.  Weird pronouns, nonbinary stuff, all of that is really just a way to say &quot;don&#39;t worry about this gender stuff, just treat me like a person.&quot;  Its shocking how invested people like you get in the gender presentation of a tiny minority of other people.  It doesn&#39;t matter, it shouldn&#39;t matter, and if y&#39;all didn&#39;t get so offended by people who were born a bit different no one would care.</p>

<p>They also love to embrace self-destructive behaviors </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t agree with a lot of what you said, but this line got me wondering.   </p>

<p>Isn’t the suicide rate of trans people over 40%?  Of so, that’s astronomical and begs the question (in my mind at least):  Is this transitioning/gender dysphoria thing just a band-aid to cover up deeper mental health issues, such as severe depression?   Of course some might argue that they are depressed because they aren’t the gender they feel they are - but if that’s the case, shouldn’t the fact that they transitioned/are on the road to transitioning alleviate the depression then?  </p>

<p>Seems to me the mental health industry is failing these people horribly - unless selling ridiculously expensive hormone treatments is the actual onjective.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the link:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>Forty-one percent of the transgender persons in the United States</strong> attempt for suicide at least once in their life.[8] <strong>In San Francisco, the prevalence of attempted suicide among transgender persons is 32%, among young age (&lt;25 years) it is 50%.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Transgender persons are at higher risk for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts at Virginia.[11] Fifty percent of transgender persons in Australia have attempted suicide at least once in their lives.[12] In England, 48% of the transgender young people had attempted suicide at least once in their lives.[13]&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, and this too:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The current review covers research studies from electronic database and manual search and also supplements information with gray literature.** The review has included important studies conducted across the countries** and through more light on issues and situations surrounded suicidality and suicidal behavior among transgender persons, and <strong>the efforts are taken to address the same across the countries and in the Indian context.</strong> The transgender community is highly vulnerable for suicidality and suicidal behavior which is a challenging phenomena for the governments and organizations globally. However, the <strong>countries like the United States are trying to address the same at national level</strong> but in the Indian context, a lot of ground work should happen. The involvement of government, policy, institutions, organizations, public, along with the involvement of transgender community is required.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, yes - it is in the Indian context, but the statistics it mentions are from the US and other countries. </p>

<p>Just because the dead trans woman’s sister-in-law feels that it was police brutality doesn’t make it so.  Just because “nearly half” of the trans population interviewed “felt uncomfortable” calling the cops doesn’t mean they are victims of police brutality.  </p>

<p>Again, excessive force against a trans person.</p>

<p>Scout Schultz
 a 21-year-old non binary intersex student at Georgia Tech, was shot and killed by police after experiencing a mental breakdown on campus. Video was taken of Schultz carrying a small pocket knife while yelling &quot;shoot me!&quot; at police while walking towards them. </p>

<p>Yet again, excessive use of force.</p>

<p>Not to mention the consistant misgendering and deadnaming of trans victims of violence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HuffPo article claiming brutality, yet again, Kayden Clarke lunged at cops with a knife (and that story corroborates my hypothesis of other serious mental illness accompanying this trans person).  They weren’t killed because Trans, they were killed because they threatened cops with a deadly weapon.</p>

<p>Scout Shulz - armed, appears to have committed suicide-by-cop (you didn’t link that article).  Having a mental breakdown...hmmmm...  notice a trend?   </p>

<p>Sean Marie Hake - 911 transcrip says he had a razor blade to mother’s throat and threatened to kill her.  Servere mental issues, including one prior involuntary commitment.  Jury is out (I guess) on whether excessive force was used, but that’s a civil case.  </p>

<p>Stop with the misgendering is a micro aggression nonsense too.   </p>

<p>Look, the point I was trying to make is that the mental health industry is failing these people badly.  Something is wrong where a community has an over 40% suicide rate, and I’m not buying the “it’s everyone else’s fault” when it is clear in every single case you cited that the trans person at issue had serious mental health problems.  </p>

<p>As a visitor of this sub, I wonder about this from several conspiracy angles.  Why is this trans/12 different genders stuff being pushed down America’s throat?  Greedy big pharmaceutical looking to make massive profits selling hormone treatments now that there are no more blockbuster drugs coming out, and the psychiatric industry (pseudo-science at best in my book) hitching their wagon now that regular old depression is so last decade?  Just another instance of TPTB further trying to compartmentalize people into smaller and smaller warring tribes so they can continue their fuckery unchecked?  Feminization (because MTF seems way the fuck more common than FTM) in the hopes of creating a more easily controlled population?  A combination?  </p>

<p>There’s an angle here and I want to know what it is.  And people that need mental health help should be getting adequate treatment.  I feel like the industry is pushing this as a snake oil cure-all to people who have other problems and are only making these people’s lives worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks!   </p>

<p>I note a lot of that describes homosexuality (which I believe is natural) and cross-dressing.  In fact, I won’t dispute that genuine gender dysphoria is a real “thing”.  </p>

<p>We’re getting off track though.  The point of the discussion is whether or not the seeming push for 56 new genders is organic or inorganic, and if inorganic, by whom and to what end?   Why is this such a major issue if it affects so few?  Why now?   </p>

<p>I think most folks are fine with people doing whatever they want to themselves or thinking whatever they want.  </p>

<p>At the least, do you believe that this issue is being rammed to the forefront as a way to further subdivide us into identity groups, they way it seems some are trying to do with race, etc?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;seeming push for 56 new genders&quot; is absolutely a right wing narrative trying to frame trans people, who want to be recognized as people regardless of their unusual gender presentation, as irrational.</p>

<p>Trans issues have come to the fore recently for a variety of reasons, but plenty of them are obvious.  Gay rights have advanced far enough that decent people are now much more accepting of trans people than they used to be.  Trans people have been an important enough part of the LGBT community that there are plenty of gays who, having achieved their legal and social rights, don&#39;t want to forget their trans friends who helped them get there.</p>

<p>On the more cynical side, neoliberals/the right wing of the democratic party is in a tricky position where they refuse to do anything actually progressive economically or in foreign policy, but they still need to posture as being progressive to keep their base onboard.  Around 2012 they realized gay marriage was perfect for this, and once that was achieved trans issues took their place, as being something that did not challenge the overarching power structure, yet was a big enough deal for enough marginalized people to insulate themselves from left-wing criticism.</p>

<p>The biggest reason though is that conservatives love to trumpet trans issues.  They&#39;re complicated, difficult to explain properly in soundbites, and something the average republican voter has never even tried to understand.  At least with gay people, there are enough that most straight people probably know a gay person, and can build categorical acceptance out of that individual relationship.  Trans people are rare enough, and often cis-passing enough, that its much less likely for the average middle aged person to know a trans person, and learn about their experience directly.  Thus, when most of their information comes from fox news or attack helicopter memes, its infinitely easier for the right to control the narrative.  Also, &quot;trans&quot; issues actually encompass a lot of different but similar sorts of things, so its even harder to explain through our idiotic media, and much easier to characterize as dishonest or inconsistent.</p>

<p>Right wingers need to scare their voters to maintain power, and because gay people and atheists are no longer as scary as before, they need a new villain.  That&#39;s the real reason its being &quot;rammed down your throat.&quot;  No cishet person is going to notice transpeople using the same bathroom as them, but if you get cable news and facebook to pump out a &quot;men are going into women&#39;s bathrooms!!!!&quot; message for long enough its easy to gin up a moral panic.</p>

<p>Also, dysphoria is natural as well, and some forms of it can be identified through MRIs: <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fendo.2014.00060/full">Hypothalamic response to the chemo-signal androstadienone in gender dysphoric children and adolescents</a>

    <div class="md"><p>Gender dysphoria is a mental illness and is defined in the DSM-5. That is why insurance companies will pay for transition surgery and hormone replacement. What I don’t understand is how the gender-fluid nonsense does not fall under that category. </p>

<p>Additionally, how does cross dressing and drag shows help the gender fluid movement? If anything, they are confirming the binary gender stereotype. It really takes some serious mental gymnastics to make that all work without severe cognitive dissonance.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to your precious DSM-5, and guidance published by the APA:</p>

<p>&quot;Persons experiencing gender dysphoria need a diagnostic term that protects their access to care and won’t be used against them in social, occupational, or legal areas.
&quot;When it comes to access to care, many of the treatment options for this condition include counseling, cross-sex hormones, gender reassignment surgery, and social and legal transition to the desired gender. <strong>To get insurance coverage for the medical treatments, individuals need a diagnosis.</strong> <strong><em>The Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders Work Group was concerned that removing the condition as a psychiatric diagnosis—as some had suggested—would jeopardize access to care.&quot;</em></strong></p>

<p>Also:</p>

<p>&quot;It is important to note that gender nonconformity is not in itself a mental disorder. The critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition.&quot;</p>

<p>Exactly. Which is why it remains in the DSM-5. If the whole gender fluid movement gets their way, they would significantly harm transpeople who would not be able to get gender reassignment surgeries and hormone therapies covered by insurance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately this is a subject that you can&#39;t talk about. Science isn&#39;t allowed to study it. That alone says to me it&#39;s by design. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but if you don&#39;t think that TPTB are willing to rewire your genes and bodily chemicals then I don&#39;t know what to tell you. </p>

<p>Everything is a psychological disorder now adays. But somehow wanting to change your sex or being sexually attracted to your same sex isn&#39;t? Doesn&#39;t seem logical to me in the slightest but it affects so many people now and has become taboo. </p>

<p>All part of the long running eugenics war being waged against the population in my opinion. </p>

<p>psychological difference =/= disorder, disorder has the connotation of negatively affecting health. for the most part people now understand that being gay isn’t a choice and it also isn’t a negative health condition. discussion of transgenderism or homosexuality is not taboo, intolerance is. and you don’t need to fully understand why people would want to go through with it in order to accept them or treat them like an equal human being. Its not like these people didnt exist in prebious generations, they just were in hiding or sent to conversion therapy and shit like that. and that fear/hatres still exists despite efforts to make society more acccepting of one another. stuff like bathroom laws barring trans people from using the bathroom they identify with being supported by stoking fears that trans people are perverts who want to assault you, ignoring the fact that transgender people are the most likely group of people to be victims of sexual violence.</p>

<p>its like weve been conditioned to be so afraid of anything different that acceptance of people who want to be a different gender seems like a huge deal when it should be a nonissue</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d argue that tough there a probably some cases where peoples are on the biological limits of what makes you a man or a woman exist, there are a lot of peoples with psychological issues that play the gender game now as it bring then sympathy.</p>

<p>Also, take hormones, removing an organ doesn&#39;t happen without any consequences, psychological, emotional or physical. Just look at the tons of side effects for medication like SSRI.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure this current state of affair is organic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i wouldn’t consider it artificial, more that acceptance of any previously taboo topic would lead to more cases of that topic occurring. the danish girl was a pretty popular and well received film iirc and that’s about a real person who was born in the late 1800s. just because something is more popular doesn’t mean it is artificially or conspiratorially driven. it would be equivalent to saying states are legalizing marijuana to make people complacent but we know that the truth is that people are opening their eyes to see that the criminalization of marijuana in the first place was purely political and profit driven, and i don’t see the growing acceptance of transgender as being very different from the slow acceptance of black people decades ago or gay people in the more recent past</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gender fluid is the idea of your body producing trstosterone (Male gene dominant chemical) or estrogen(the female dominant) </p>

<p>you see, our bodies produce both, the same way our bodies produce dopeamine. What we include in our diet has the ability to increase or decrease the production of one or the other or both, people are choosing to experiment with this...</p>

<p>Body fat also plays a factor. Body fat impedes testosterone production-and increases estrogen production. Butter, milk, soy, etc. This is why some people can&#39;t seem to build muscle and turn to steroids. &quot;roid rage&quot; is producing so much testosterone it affects you psychologically... just like any kind of overdose it has permanent and life altering affects. </p>

<p>Kids that are &quot;born gay&quot; could very well be born with a body that produces and actively seeks a gender fluid that does not match their genetalia- They are struggling to comprehend this just as you are... you fuckin milk boi. ;<sup>)</sup></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another thing I watch is how disgusting it is how they promote the concept of &quot;being popular&quot; in school. I think I saw &quot;Fist Fight&quot; a movie with Ice Cube, garbage movie, but the thing most important for the parents and the child was being popular in school. Like it was a matter of life and death...  </p>

<p>All this propaganda we think we distinguish, kids don&#39;t, and they&#39;re desperate for attention and popularity. What&#39;s the best way to get some empathy and reach popularity? You play the victim card and become &quot;brave&quot; by declaring your sexual orientation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think popularity is naturally ingrained in us, instinctively.  We are social animals, after all.  Our ability to survive and thrive works best when we work together.  As such, we all feel the innate need to belong somewhere.  </p>

<p>I think you’re right about the victimhod card.  IMO, there are four groups of young people within a high school.  There’s the “it” crowd, the regular shmoes (largest group), the edgy/weird/bad seed yet cool in their own way crowd, and the losers.  The losers don’t fit in, which causes them to be resentful and creates a pattern of further exclusion.  </p>

<p>These used to be edgy try-yards in my day.  Now they’re the loud and proud victims of whatever, and “no one likes them because they identify as gender non-conforming” (when, in reality, no one liked them before because of the reasons I said, but let’s forget about facts and history because feels).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is ridiculous. My brother is transgender; there&#39;s nothing wrong with being transgender, I know many transgender people. And your claim that there&#39;s more estrogen isn&#39;t true; a lot of people transition from female to male, including my brother. Let&#39;s talk about some real conspiracies, as there&#39;s no lack of them.</p>
