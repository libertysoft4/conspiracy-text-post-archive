    <div class="md"><p>This is not a recent phenomena. There are literally millions of reports from across the world. It really began to be reported regularly about 6 years ago, with the creation of entire YouTube channels devoted to documenting the issue...
 Perhaps, the recent increase is due to the &quot;accidental&quot; release of government patents  on devices that facilitated the transmission of voice to skull technology (v2K), entirely manipulated the emotional state of the unlucky target, remotely caused pain and involuntary movements as a form of virtually unprovable torture that mirrors schizophrenia and other mental illnesses, increases in body temperatures, transmission of waking-state &quot;visions&quot; or dream sequences, and other terrifying horrors beyond any nightmare described in any futuristic, authoritarian, sci-fi dystopia...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They did it to John Nash way back then. He ran all over the globe looking for help but noone helped him. Has quoted as saying something to the extent that only a miracle can save humanity at this point. Which would be a cataclysm or Jesus returning or something major. He&#39;s right. They are literally everywhere and their hivemind is everywhere as well. They literally have to do what their told. I believe its the actual devil and his demons that direct this whole house of cards. I was stalked by mainly blacks and Muslims when it was really bad but it became every race there is basically. There is no race when it comes to gang stalking. I even had an Amerindian stalk me up north. Lots of Asians knew who I was and participated in the stalking. That&#39;s an important part of it. It seems most TIs are considered white but there really is no race when it comes to this stuff. On both sides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its one of the biggest &quot;conspiracies&quot; there is. Look up Andy Pero, Kyle Odom, Esteban Santiago. Gang stalking is real and so is mind reading/manipulation of the mind body and spirit through the digital realm. They call themselves Masons and are part of the devils hivemind. They are controlled by voices and handlers. They occupy alto of occupations from high to low and can completely ruin your life with ease. A musician once told me &quot;Do what they say or they&#39;ll make your life hell.&quot; tlThen he said &quot;Im serious.&quot; He was correct and ive been punished for not doing what was expected of me. This has been happening since 2014. </p>

<p>The first stalker thing I ever saw was a train blocking all ways backvto my apartment and just sitting there. I thought it was just a coincidence but it wasnt. Then they started using the radio on me. They were watching me and were talking about what I was doing in coded sentences. Like &quot;I can know a much about a certain topic but I can&#39;t even see something right in front of my face. They talked to me through the radio for months. Is be walking down the street and someone would roll by me with &quot;Don&#39;t believe me just watch&quot; playing and then it would happen again 5 minutes later.</p>

<p>I ended up being stalked by Blacks and Muslims (oddly enough as most of my posts and stuff were about the Jewish people (big mistake on many levels)). They were everywhere I went and I am not joking. I pussed out and flew home the next day and the women next to me was reading a book that pertained to my situation that Amazon kindle also suggested to me (forgot to mention how they use kindle and Youtube suggestions to talk to me.) once I got home a black woman walked by menand said &quot;You better getbrid of everything on there&quot; (my prepaid phone). I followed her tobsee what she was doing and she started to act scared (stalker acting victimized by me following...)</p>

<p>People were all around me that were involved in this. They are everywhere (even in North Dakota, Montana etc...)
I ended up going to rehab and literally somehow every single person almost was a gang stalker. I walked into art one day and everyone of them had painted all seeing eyes on the canvases. Im not lying about that. They all just stared at me until I set down andnI overheard a few of them say &quot;he hasn&#39;t even tried to run yet.&quot; Running in fear is something they love. Also making good people seem insane is another thing they love doing.</p>

<p>That&#39;s nothing compared to some of the crazy stuff Ive been through. Only the tip of the iceberg. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you sound like a future mass shooter. i dont mean that as an insult i just read kyle odom&#39;s manifesto recently and the comparisons are easily made. to anyone without any background knowledge of the gangstalking conspiracy theory you just sound nutty, which as you say would be one of the aims of your stalkers. all i can suggest is if you want anyone to believe your claims or have any proof to fight back with you need to be documenting everything. take pictures, keep journals, wear a concealed gopro camera at all times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not saying someone being gangstalked shouldn&#39;t document everything, but you might very well drive yourself nuts trying to document their every move. It also becomes very clear to the gang that they are getting to you at that point. It&#39;s also provides a data base of evidence the authorities can use to have you committed or the gang can use to frame you for a crime. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong here, but gangstalking is generally done to drive a person crazy leaving as little evidence as possible. It&#39;s also designed to mimic mental disorder in the victim. For someone who is a victim of gang stalking it must be terribly difficult to self assess their own mental competency. No easy answers for either victims of gang stalkers or victims of mental disorder. They share alot of similar traits but they are not necessarily the same thing. The most sophisticated gang stalkers will pick a victim predisposed to mental illness or drug abuse if it fits with their objective. Otherwise there is a good chance that one way or another their victim will be genuinely mentally ill to some extent before it&#39;s all through.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think I have ever posted on here... anyhoots, I know of 3 people that this has happened to. What are the odds of that? The first person I connected with that endured this, I thought she was just over worked so I drove from Ohio to Indiana to drive around with her for the day and prove her wrong. A fair amount of what she was citing I felt like were simply misunderstandings of shadow and the like. Three hours into our driving, I noticed a black suv behind us. I am not sure what drew my attention to it but I just blew it off as me picking up on her fear. We pulled into a store, it parked, another pulled up beside it, we left, the second one pulled out with us. We went back to her house and found about 30 minutes of her security camera footage missing. Interesting.... after several hours of this I had to make my way home. As I left, I noticed a black suv behind me again. Once I got to the Ohio boarder the suv made a clear and direct u-turn. A long term friend going through this now has tons of evidence. I should mention this is not 3 people I know going through this simultaneously, this is spread out over several years.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of my personal posting is a product of myself waiting for the right time, it&#39;s been nearly 4 years since I realized I was on any sort of list, and it&#39;s taken all four of those years to get myself in a position wher eI have restored my social standing in my community, as well as regained my personal mental and physical health to be able to properly tell my story. It helps that my people have since been able to see past the lies and see me for who I am, the same kid that left and unfortunately returned with a wax wire. It was a matter of gaining so much heat that it was impossible for my stalkers to continue to stalk and manipulate what was going on around me, while still maintaining balance for my friends and family to remain unaffected. You can&#39;t just walk up to someone after coming back from something like this and be like &quot;yo watch my back for the next few months I got some crazy shit going on in the background&quot;</p>

<p>Help yourself before you help anyone else, but certainly do what you need to do to properly re-evaluate already established relationships to find out who you should trust in the future and who you should cut out in the future. This requires A LOT of sacrifices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That targeted individuals have theur minds compromised because they originally were great critical thinkers and could be seen as a threat. Originally targeted to be inducted into the hollywood pedophile ring, if they did not cooperate they would have their mind wiped or &quot;brainwashed&quot; to be unable to tell the world.</p>

<p>MOST if not all communication is subliminal. Due to MKultra most of my generation are sleepers, having their brain subjected to the refined equation of storytelling dince they were old enough to be placed in front of a television screen. depending on your special snowflake you would have reacted fifferently and your brain developed accordingly. Ever hear of the idea of the youngest child in the family being the &quot;golden child&quot; while the eldest is seen as the most responsible? Middle children are raised to feel overlooked, while single children are raised with no competition in the household. All can <em>relate</em> to different character identities and thus seek out certain narratives based on the identity they want to form into- leaving opportunity for switches to be pulled for hours on end with no immediate reaction or alarm. <em>some are lucky if they blink</em></p>

<p>Hopefully this explains further so you can make the connections yourself. If not please be more specific with what you believe I grazed over. I myself have lots of patience for children, I believe they need it more than ever; if you are on this website attempting to converse with me it is a safe assumption you are not a <em>child</em>, and so I will not give You the same luxury of patience.</p>

<p>I decidedly do not touch on other people&#39;s experiences, particularly when they have pre-existing media coverage. This is for multiple reasons, the foremost being that, as I was taught in my law classes, the most important case when assigning parralels to build a case of your own the *only* case that matters is the &quot;Precedent setting case&quot; or the first resolved case. Until that case is identified as such it is all one ongoing investigation, and thus can not stand on it&#39;s own.</p>

<p>Basically, no comment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve working on multiple threads at once so my apologies for seeming kind of touch and go, plus I&#39;m keeping with my daily routines. This is an extra workload I have taken on as well as continuing my research. Everything is one stream of conscious, not to mention that my mental stability is constantly being questioned due to the gravity of the subject matter, and how I am putting myself in such a vulnerable position to all of you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll parrot what I said the other day:  99% of gangstalking claims can very likely be attributed to psychosis and mental illness.  The remaining percentage? I&#39;m open to the possibility it&#39;s a real phenomenon.</p>

<p>Sociopaths gaslight their SO all the time.  Who&#39;s to say there aren&#39;t cults filled with sociopaths who target particular individuals and gaslight them on a grander scale?  </p>
