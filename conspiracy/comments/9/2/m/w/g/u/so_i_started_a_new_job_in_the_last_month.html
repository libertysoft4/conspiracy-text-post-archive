        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve started a new job in the last month. I&#39;ve been using my girlfriend&#39;s cell phone for work. I was unemployed for quite a while so I haven&#39;t had a personal cell for almost a year.</p>

<p>I did an &quot;away&quot; trip with work and had her phone so that I could still keep in contact with the office and fellow employees if I needed to.</p>

<p>She has been getting &quot;people you may know&quot; suggestions of all the people at the new place I work. I haven&#39;t received ANY of them on my Facebook.</p>

<p>So Facebook is using cell usage to determine connections? Wtf. Who would be giving them this data?</p>

Why is this person that you work with all over your facebook. he called you once when you weren&#39;t even at work... still probably innocent, but now u have doubt. and so does she.  or you never say anything about something you see. but eventually, you will see something you have a question about. and those type questions tend to come out at the worst times.</p>

<p>I had a doctor apt and NEVER looked up anything about it, not even the location since it&#39;s right down the road.</p>

<p>Literally a week later I started getting massive ads for this type of doctor.</p>

<p>The device that it came on did not accompany me to the apt, the only connection was an email.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, Facebook figured it out using GPS. It only needs a few things. It doesn&#39;t need the app. It doesn&#39;t even need you to log-in to Facebook. It doesn&#39;t even need you to be friends with any co-workers on your own Facebook. Here&#39;s all that Facebook needs:</p>

<ul>
<li>You accessed any website on your phone during the trip. </li>
<li>You gave your location to this website.</li>
<li>This website had Facebook analytics on it (or you went to Facebook.com) and Facebook got your location.</li>
<li>Someone else on the trip did the same thing.</li>
<li>You and your girlfriend are &quot;in a relationship&quot; on Facebook or even just friends.</li>
<li>Your Facebook profile has one or more of your co-workers as friends, or more likely, has them as &quot;uncertain connections&quot; like friends of friends, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here&#39;s how it works and why Facebook thinks she&#39;s connected to them, even if none of your co-workers are friends with you on Facebook:</p>

<p>You don&#39;t see your uncertain connections, it&#39;s more of a percentage thing, but they are tracked in the background. Facebook won&#39;t recommend complete strangers. Since it is not sure if you know your co-workers, it won&#39;t recommend them. It doesn&#39;t have recent location data, and even if it did, maybe you&#39;re at a gas station and these are just your regular customers, not friends.</p>

<p>Facebook then noticed that your girlfriend went to an &quot;event&quot; (i.e. went somewhere she doesn&#39;t usually go) based on location data and time spent in that location. It then cross-referenced other &quot;attendees&quot; and became more sure it was an &quot;event&quot;. She still could be going to some event where she doesn&#39;t know anyone, so these are still uncertain connections for her and wouldn&#39;t be recommended. Maybe she&#39;s the caterer at a hotel where a conference is going on and has zero connection to these people.</p>

<p>But, Facebook then checked your profile and found you had all these uncertain connections. By cross-referencing these with your uncertain connections it boosted the certainty of these potential connections given that she attended events with a specific set of people--i.e. your uncertain connections.</p>

<p>And there are quite a few other things you don&#39;t have any control over that will boost the certainty. Like, this specific set of people might already be well-connected and so it decided this was a &quot;group&quot; increasing the certainty.</p>
