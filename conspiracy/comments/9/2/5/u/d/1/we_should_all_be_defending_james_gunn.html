The self-proclaimed autists digging up old tweets might think they&#39;re fighting for &quot;the children,&quot; but what they&#39;re really doing is playing foot soldiers in a moral panic that could be turned on anyone, and that&#39;s being weaponized for clicks.</p>

<p>Free speech matters - even gross, offensive speech like Gunn&#39;s old tweets. And if he can be fired for telling some bad jokes, anyone can have their past dug up and used against them.</p>

<p>Took a picture of yourself eating pizza? You&#39;re a pedo. Tweeted a pic with your arm around your own kid? You&#39;re a pedo. Showed even the slightest hesitation about destroying someone&#39;s career because of old tweets? You&#39;re a pedo.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter if there&#39;s no credible accusation. Doesn&#39;t matter if there&#39;s no victim. Doesn&#39;t matter if there&#39;s no evidence at all.</p>

<p>If the mob decides you&#39;re a pedo, you&#39;re a pedo. </p>

<p>James Gunn was just the next victim. Who comes after him?</p>

<p>You, maybe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>AMENDMENT I</p>

<p>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</p>

<p>AMENDMENT IV</p>

<p>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<p>&quot;During the McCarthy era, hundreds of Americans were accused of being communists or communist sympathizers and became the subject of aggressive investigations and questioning before government or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_industry">private industry</a> panels, committees and agencies. The primary targets of such suspicions were government employees, those in the entertainment industry, educators and labor union activists. Suspicions were often given credence despite inconclusive or questionable evidence, and the level of threat posed by a person&#39;s real or supposed leftist associations or beliefs was sometimes exaggerated. Many people suffered loss of employment or destruction of their careers; some even suffered imprisonment. Most of these punishments came about through trial verdicts later overturned,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism#cite_note-3">[3]</a> laws that were later declared unconstitutional,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism#cite_note-4">[4]</a> dismissals for reasons later declared illegal<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism#cite_note-5">[5]</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit">actionable</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism#cite_note-6">[6]</a> or extra-legal procedures that would come into general disrepute. &quot;</p>

It can take adults a long time to work up the courage and deal with their trauma.   When the victims are children it gets much more complicated.   I know from relatives who were abused that they did speak up, but the adults decided it was better not to pursue the matter.  In particular, law enforcement convinced the parents of the victim that having her take the witness stand could retraumatize her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Explains a lot.   You need to Break on Through to the Other Side..</p>

<p>I enjoyed the Guardians movies, they were fine, mostly forgettable like most comic book fare.   Just find it interesting how some people are so quick to excuse pedophilia.  Your position seems to be that publicly talking about raping children, urinating on them, raping an unconscious girlfriend in the ass  etc..  that all of this should be tolerated by an employer.    Most of us live in a world where merely being late to work too many times will get you tossed, heck, doing nothing wrong whatsoever you&#39;ll get tossed if the company reorganizes or merges.    So it&#39;s fascinating to see some people so upset that a multi millionaire was told his services would no longer be needed after his highly questionable conduct came to public attention.    In Hollywood people are often out of work when they seemingly did nothing wrong at all.   You&#39;ll see an actress give a great performance but she doesn&#39;t get cast again for years.    I guess it&#39;s a bit strange that the pedophile director merits all of this concern.   Besides the people who want to continue normalizing deviancy we have the political aspect of this.   Roseanne deserves to have her hit show cancelled over a couple tweets cause she doesn&#39;t hate the President, but Gunn should work forever despite pedophilia because he attacked the President.</p>

<p>Sigh,   Not good times for America.  It&#39;s like some of the feminists who all of a sudden think Stormy Daniels is a heroine for being a backstabbing blackmailing drug addict whore with a sleazy ambulance chaser at her side.   Supposedly there was a consensual affair a decade ago and she sought money to shut up.   She got paid.   Then she wanted more.   She&#39;s not a good person.   Anyway, your boy Gunn has money in the bank and he&#39;ll get to do other work.   </p>
