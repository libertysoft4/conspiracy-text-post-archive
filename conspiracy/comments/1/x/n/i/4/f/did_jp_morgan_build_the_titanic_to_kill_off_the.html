        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In 1898 a man named Morgan Robertson penned a book titled &quot;<em>Wreck of the Titan</em>&quot; about a luxury liner deemed unsinkable that was going too fast in the North Atlantic in April and hit and iceberg killing most everyone on board due to lack of lifeboats.</p>

<p>14 years later this fictional book would play out in real life exactly down to the name, with the wreck of the Titanic; but this time it would have major political implications. Some of the wealthiest men in the world were on that ship and some were opposed to the Federal Reserve and central banks.</p>

<p>FACT: JP Morgan funded/built the Titanic</p>

<p>FACT: JP Morgan was booked on the voyage but canceled at the last second.</p>

<p>FACT: Friend of JP Morgan, Milton Hersey, also canceled at the last moment and survived to build the Hersey food empire.</p>

<p>FACT: There were no red flares on board to signal to any boats for rescue. Only white flares that signal a party and that everything is okay.</p>

<p>FACT: It was the first ship of its kind with the ability to seal decks electromagnetically which could also seal people below deck.</p>

<p>FACT: The Captain Edward Smith was one of the most decorated Captains of his time and would have been totally out of character by avoiding precautions.</p>

<p>FACT: The author of the book was poisoned to death a couple years after the Titanic sank.</p>

<p>FACT: The Federal Reserve was formed the very next year.</p>

<p>FACT: The Astor Family was one of the richest families in the world and John Astor III opposed the Federal Reserve. </p>

<p>John Jacob Astor IV, the richest man in the world at the time, a friend of Nikola Tesla, and an outspoken opponent of the creation of the Federal Reserve.  Astor gained his wealth, in part, as a real estate builder, investor, and inventor.  Other prominent Federal Reserve detractors, such as Benjamin Guggenheim and Isa Strauss, also died on board.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Did JP Morgan get the idea of how to kill off the opposition to the Federal Reserve from a book written 14 years prior? This was a book titled &quot;The Titan&quot; published 14 years before the Titanic sank and look at the similarities.</p>

<p>Did they hatch a plan at Jekyll Island to build a ship to eliminate the competition? </p>

<p><strong>Similarities to the Titanic</strong></p>

<p>Although the novel was written before the Olympic-class Titanic had even been designed, there are some remarkable similarities between the fictional and real-life counterparts. Like the Titanic, the fictional ship sank in April in the North Atlantic, and there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers. There are also similarities between the size (800 ft long for Titan versus 882 ft 9 in long for the Titanic), speed (25 knots for Titan, 21 knots for Titanic) and life-saving equipment.</p>

<p>Beyond the name, the similarities between the Titanic and the fictional Titan include:</p>

<p><strong>Described as &quot;unsinkable&quot;</strong> </p>

<p>The Titanic was the world&#39;s largest luxury liner (882 feet, displacing 63,000 long tons), and was once described as being practically &quot;unsinkable&quot;.
The Titan was the largest craft afloat and the greatest of the works of men (800 feet, displacing 75,000 tons), and was considered &quot;unsinkable&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Shortage of lifeboats</strong></p>

<p>The Titanic carried only 16 lifeboats, plus 4 Engelhardt folding lifeboats,less than half the number required for her passenger capacity of 3000.
The Titan carried &quot;as few as the law allowed&quot;, 24 lifeboats, less than half needed for her 3000 capacity.</p>

<p><strong>Struck an iceberg</strong></p>

<p>Moving too fast at 22½ knots,the Titanic struck an iceberg on the starboard side on the night of April 14, 1912 in the North Atlantic 400 miles away from Newfoundland.
Also on an April night, in the North Atlantic 400 miles from Newfoundland (Terranova), the Titan hit an iceberg while traveling at 25 knots, also on the starboard side.</p>

<p><strong>Sinking</strong> </p>

<p>The unsinkable Titanic sank, and more than half of her 2200 passengers died.
The indestructible Titan also sank, more than half of her 2500 passengers drowning.
Went down bow first, the Titan actually capsizing before it sank.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ship&#39;s famous sinking in 1912, the year before Morgan&#39;s death, was a financial disaster for IMM, which was forced to apply for bankruptcy protection in 1915. Analysis of financial records shows that IMM was overleveraged and suffered from inadequate cash flow that caused it to default on bond interest payments. (wiki information)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is seriously the best conspiracy theory I have ever heard/read.</p>

<p>The genesis of this conspiracy would have begun in July of 1908, when the idea of the Titanic was first presented in a series of concept drawings.</p>

<p>During the next four years, JP Morgan would have needed the following parts of his plan for killing John Jacob Astor IV, Benjamin Guggenheim and Isa Strauss to fall into place:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Getting all of those men on board the Titanic.</p></li>
<li><p>Developing a fail proof plan for sinking the Titanic.</p></li>
<li><p>Developing a plan of making sure none of those men getting into a life boat.</p></li>
<li><p>Developing a plan in which there would be no other ships that could/would help with the rescuing of the survivors.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>All in all, it&#39;s gotta be the most elaborate plan in the history of the world to kill three men.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering the creation of the FED was at stake, copying a plan detailed in a book to eliminate opposition is not that far fetched.</p>

<p>All JP had to do was build a ship interesting enough to get those people on board the death trap, the rest would play itself out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Offing those three, in the version of this conspiracy theory, was just icing on the cake.</p>

<p>The original plan was to get rid of the &quot;Titanic&quot; (actually the Olympus, its sister ship) in a massive insurance scam. They were <em>not</em> planning on having that many people die. There was an extremely tragic miscommunication, and the ship that was prepared to rescue the passengers from the Titanic was miles away from where it needed to be.</p>

<p>Those &quot;in the know&quot; on the Titanic signaled what they <em>thought</em> was that ship, but was actually an illegal fishing vessel. When the fishing vessel responded, they assumed everything was going according to plan, when it couldn&#39;t be further from the truth.</p>

<p>During this insurance &quot;scam,&quot; it would be conceivable to assassinate all three men during the confusion. In fact, one eye witness reported seeing John Astor&#39;s &quot;maimed&quot; body, but obviously that could&#39;ve happened on accident during the sinking as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just wanted to add that the actual Titanic was never called &quot;unsinkable&quot; until after it sank. That was one of the large myths that surrounded the Titanic.

<p><em>The Titanic was the world&#39;s largest luxury liner (882 feet, displacing 63,000 long tons), and was once described as being practically &quot;unsinkable&quot;.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You also imply Morgan used the book word for word, which is absurd. The plan as a whole did pan out the same way.

<p>If you say the Titanic is similar to the Titan because they were both said unsinkable, I say that is wrong. Because the Titan was deemed unsinkable before it sank, the Titanic was not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether the claim was made before or after is <em>completely irrelevant</em>, as the text does not put a timeline into when that claim was made.</p>

<p>This is not true. There were no opponents of the Federal Reserve in April, 1912, because the Federal Reserve had not even been proposed yet. It wasn&#39;t proposed until after Woodrow Wilson was elected. Wilson was not even a frontrunner for the Democratic nomination back in April 1912.</p>

<p>These people <em>may</em> have been opponents of Aldrich&#39;s National Reserve  plan, but:</p>

<p>I am not ignorant of any of the previous banks. What I am saying is that <em>this particular proposal</em> did not exist in April 1912 and therefore <em>had no opponents</em>.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t say who <em>would</em> oppose a proposal that didn&#39;t exist. For example, John Jacob Astor, the great-grandfather of the Astor who died on the Titanic, was <em>against</em> renewing the charter of the first Bank of the United States. But, just a few years later, he helped found the second Bank of the United States.</p>

<p>When this article states that Astor, Guggenheim, and Strauss were opponents of the Federal Reserve it is <strong>lying</strong>. It is <strong>a hoax</strong>. There were <em>no opponents</em> to the Federal Reserve in April 1912.</p>

<p>Note how this article presents <em>no evidence</em> that they were opponents. It cannot present any evidence because it is <em>impossible</em> that they were opposed to a proposal that hadn&#39;t even been made yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although I do not necessarily disagree with you regarding this theory, your logic here is entirely flawed. You need to think about this critically. </p>

<p>(I will skip the part where this central bank proposal, though not perfectly finalized on the specific date you cite with all the subsubsubsections in place, was thoroughly debated by politicians, bankers, journalists, and the public for years prior)</p>

<p>Your quote: &quot;...it is <em>impossible</em> that they were opposed to a proposal that hadn&#39;t even been made yet.&quot; </p>

<p>Below is one, two-part simple example of why that statement is false:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hypothetically, assume that today I said &quot;I am opposed to any proposal brought forth in the future by Politician #1.&quot; Now, assume tomorrow Politician #1 brings forth a proposal.

<li><p>Now, replace &quot;I am opposed to any proposal brought forth in the future by Politician #1&quot; with &quot;I am opposed to any central banking system.&quot; Does a proposal for a central bank have to exist for me to oppose central banking systems? Or, does a central banking system need to exist for me to oppose them?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I also don&#39;t buy many of the facts in this conspiracy. The idea that Astor, Guggenheim, and Strauss were opponents of a system that would favour the rich, especially given their backgrounds, is laughable. But, AGAIN, you are ignorant of your banking history—and, by the intelligence of your arguments, I suspect <em>willfully</em> so. State your agenda.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve had many opponents, most notable among them Congressional Representative Charles A. Lindbergh Sr., a man <em>still</em> being recognized, over a hundred years later, as an ardent opponent of the Federal Reserve. From the New York Times, June 22, 2013: <strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/business/the-federal-reserves-framers-would-be-shocked.html">The Federal Reserve’s Framers Would Be Shocked</a></strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ONE hundred years ago today, President Woodrow Wilson went before Congress and demanded that it “act now” to create the Federal Reserve System. His proposal set off a fierce debate. One of the plan’s most strident critics, Representative Charles A. Lindbergh Sr., the father of the aviator, predicted that the Federal Reserve Act would establish “the most gigantic trust on earth,” and that the Fed would become an economic dictator or, as he put it, an “invisible government by the money power.”</p>

<p>Had the congressman witnessed Ben S. Bernanke’s news conference last week, he surely would have felt vindicated. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for it being &quot;impossible that they were opposed to a proposal that hadn&#39;t even been made yet,&quot; yes, of course, but this is a ridiculous argument. I could be mugged on the way to work, or I could find my bank account drained when I get there, or, <strong>I could be otherwise robbed in a way that hadn&#39;t even been made yet.</strong> I am OPPOSED to having that happen, but I am also opposed to any other scheme <em>not yet invented</em> which causes me to lose my hard-earned money. And many many of the Reserve Act&#39;s opponents were ALSO, similarly opposed to an act which they knew full well would give these invisible powers unlimited power. People like Lindbergh Sr., for instance, were very well-travelled and very familiar with how privately-owned central banks worked in other countries such as England and Germany. You seem to conveniently be forgetting Lindbergh&#39;s quotes on this matter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This [Federal Reserve Act] establishes the most gigantic trust on earth. When the President [Wilson] signs this bill, the invisible government of the monetary power will be legalized....
the worst legislative crime of the ages is perpetrated by this banking and currency bill.&quot;</p>

<p>-- Charles A. Lindbergh, Sr. , 1913</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, let&#39;s get to your agenda. You seem pretty convinced that Mr. Federal Reserve is just a nice plan that went wrong somewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see your point. Some of the things in the article you copied are
true and interesting. Everybody thinks that the coincidences about the book
<em>Wreck of the Titan</em> are interesting.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, many of the &quot;FACTS&quot; asserted are dubious or
irrelevant:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FACT: JP Morgan funded/built the Titanic</p>

<p>FACT: JP Morgan was booked on the voyage but canceled at the last second.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, what is the point here? If Morgan knew the Titanic was going to
sink, why did he book a cabin at all? If his owning the White Star Line was
relevant, does that mean he ordered the shipping company to sabotage the
ship? If so, how come there&#39;s no evidence that anybody in the company
had any idea that it was going to sink? The chairman of White Star Lines
<a href="http://listverse.com/2011/12/09/10-people-who-did-not-board-the-titanic/">ended up in the cabin that Morgan
canceled</a>.
I guess he wasn&#39;t told.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FACT: Friend of JP Morgan, Milton Hersey, also canceled at the last moment and survived to build the Hersey food empire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the article you copied this from can&#39;t even spell Hershey&#39;s name right, but we&#39;re supposed to take the article&#39;s word that Hershey and Morgan were friends. The implication is that they were such close friends that Morgan warned Hershey that Morgan was planning a mass murder, so he shouldn&#39;t take the boat. In reality, the only relationship between the two that I can find: <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GDE-szZfkSUC&amp;amp;pg=PA142&amp;amp;dq=Morgan">&quot;He once spoke of taking the barber&#39;s chair next to the one occupied by J.P.  Morgan.&quot;</a></p>

<p>What&#39;s actually going on here is that the article labels people who survived &quot;friends&quot; and people who died &quot;the competition&quot;, when there&#39;s no evidence that either is true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FACT: There were no red flares on board to signal to any boats for rescue. Only white flares that signal a party and that everything is okay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/forums/rockets-night/2685-just-what-exactly-colors-titanics-rockets.html">False.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>FACT: The Captain Edward Smith was one of the most decorated Captains of his time and would have been totally out of character by avoiding precautions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is the point of speculating about what Smith <em>would</em> do when it&#39;s very well documented what he did, in reality, do?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FACT: The author of the book was poisoned to death a couple years after the Titanic sank.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And ...? How is this relevant to anything? The book was reissued with great publicity in 1912 because of the coincidences. The fact that he died in 1915 means what?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did they hatch a plan at Jekyll Island to build a ship to eliminate the competition?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This speculation makes no sense at all. How could you possibly know who
was going to be aboard and who would survive? Astor was only aboard
because his wife was pregnant and wanted to go home. Guggenheim and
Straus both <em>famously</em> had the opportunity to get on lifeboats, but
declined!</p>

<p>Of all the ways to kill people, can you think of a more expensive and
uncertain way than to sink one of your own multi-million dollar ships?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So, in this thread, any time that somebody brings up the quaint idea of evidence, you attack them. Four different people, so far. Cute.</p>

<p>This is <em>completely irrelevant</em> and does not nullify the statement. You&#39;re arguing semantics and not facts.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2010/04/robert-farago/this-day-in-gun-history-titanic-fires-white-flares/">True.</a> At 1:15 am, the second officer, now on duty, notified Lord that the mystery ship had fired a rocket, followed by four more. Lord wanted to know if they were “company signals,” that is, colored flares used for identification. The second officer said that he “didn’t know,” that the rockets were all white.</p>

<p>Captain Lord instructed the crew to continue to signal the other vessel with the Morse lamp, and went back to sleep. Three more rockets were observed at 1:50 and the second officer noted that the ship looked strange in the water, as if she were listing. At 2:15 am, Lord was notified that the ship could no longer be seen. Lord asked again if the lights had had any colors in them, and he was informed that they were all white.</p>

<p>The author of the book was the only one 100% capable of connecting the dots from his book to the sinking o the Titanic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your argument is missing from my look through - </p>

<p>&quot;FACT: The Astor Family was one of the richest families in the world and John Astor III opposed the Federal Reserve.
John Jacob Astor IV, the richest man in the world at the time, a friend of Nikola Tesla, and an outspoken opponent of the creation of the Federal Reserve. Astor gained his wealth, in part, as a real estate builder, investor, and inventor. Other prominent Federal Reserve detractors, such as Benjamin Guggenheim and Isa Strauss, also died on board.&quot;</p>

<p>You present it as fact yet my googling has turned up nothing specific to John Jacob Astor IV to substantiate this except for conspiracy sites. Do you have a &#39;reliable&#39; source?</p>

<p>You also try twist the debate by asserting that Bubba is a troll or even a disinfo agent for asking a relevent question that you should have the answer to if the post was properly researched as it should be if you present it as &#39;fact&#39;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you are incorrect in the substance of your post but your presentation of it and response to peoples questions is off.</p>

<p>Please advise the source.</p>

<p>In addition I am a long time conspiracy person, believe in UFOs, possible alien contact, 9/11 not being as the official version and having Israeli and/or Saudi involvement, Fluoride being bad and plenty of other things.

<p>Not that I feel I should have to defend the reasons for my queries to you but you need only scroll down my user history to see that I spend some time here even if I only comment infrequently. So your profiling of me is based upon research as thorough as your original post.</p>

<p>In fact due to your sloppy research, unfounded characterisations and apparent anger at any questioning and dismissal of questions that attack the entire point of this post I would say that you are diluting actual conspiracies with that which cannot be distinguished from fiction and are thus damaging the effort of all those seeking actual truth.</p>

<p>I will one up this particularly conspiracy by saying that what we <em>do</em> know is that Astor was <em>very</em> interested and supportive of the research and ideas of <em>Nikola Tesla</em>.</p>

<p>In fact, Astor, had he survived, may have become one of Tesla&#39;s greatest benefactors, and his struggles for financial help and eventually drifting into obscurity may never have occurred. </p>

<p>After all, it&#39;s very widely known about how Morgan pulled the plug on Tesla&#39;s dreams (and funding) when he found out that Tesla wanted to share power, wirelessly and free, to the entire world.</p>

They claim that the &#39;unsinkable&#39; myth was the result of people&#39;s interpretations of articles in the Irish News and the Shipbuilder magazine. They also claim that the myth grew after the disaster.</p>

<p>Yet, when the New York office of the White Star Line was informed that Titanic was in trouble, White Star Line Vice President P.A.S. Franklin announced: &quot;We place absolute confidence in the Titanic. We believe the boat is unsinkable.&quot; By the time Franklin spoke those words Titanic was at the bottom of the ocean. It would seem that the White Star Line President was also influenced by the &#39;myth&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have actually done some research on an academic level regarding this subject. </p>

<ul>
<li>In 1898 Morgan Robertson authored a novella entitled: Futility (Wreck of the Titan) which featured the ocean liner Titan sinking in the North Atlantic after striking an iceberg, in April. In the novella, on the Titan there were not sufficient lifeboats for passengers. </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futility,_or_the_Wreck_of_the_Titan">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futility,_or_the_Wreck_of_the_Titan</a></p>

<ul>
<li>The RMS Titanic sank on the 15th of April 1912 in North Atlantic. </li>
</ul>

<p>J.P. Morgan owned White Star Lines and was one of the many people who were supposed to be aboard the titanic – but failed to embark on the journey for various reasons including:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Robert Bacon – US ambassador to France had reserved passage but was delayed by tardy arrival. </p></li>
<li><p>Barron M. Von Bethmann – “We tossed a coin to decide.”</p></li>
<li><p>Norman Craig – Scottish MP and King’s Counsel, booked passage, “I suddenly decided not to sail, I cannot tell you why; there was simply no reason for it…I had no mysterious premonitions or visions of any kind nor did I dream of any disaster…but I do know that, at practically the last moment, I did not want to go.”</p></li>
<li><p>James Martin Gray – booked passage but took an earlier steamship a week before.</p></li>
<li><p>David Blair – second officer of the Titanic, sailed with her during sea trials. White Star Line wanted Chief Officer Henry Wilde to have experience aboard a ship he might someday captain (Titanic) so Wilde was transferred from the Olympic to the Titanic, and Blair sent over to the Olympic. This caused confusion as the ship was about to depart for America. In his rush to get off the Titanic and onto the Olympic, Blair took with him the key to crow’s nest telephone. Blair also had mislaid the crows nest binoculars. Blair stored the binoculars in his cabin and failed to inform anyone aboard the ship. Fleet had no binoculars when he was in the crow’s nest, looking for icebergs. </p></li>
<li><p>Alfred Grynne Vanderbilt I – changed his mind and decided not to board. Someone in his family objected, “because so many things can go wrong on a maiden voyage.”</p></li>
<li><p>Rev. J. Stuart Holden – On April 9, the day before sailing, Holden postponed his trip to stay with his wife. </p></li>
<li><p>Milton Hershey – In 1912, Hershey paid a $300 deposit for a class passage aboard the White Star Line. An employee at his company requested that he return early from a trip in Europe to deal with business.   </p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reasons for Sinking:</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Shortly after the ship left berth in Belfast, there was a coal fire in one of the bunkers. It took days to put out because the fire had started deep in the coal pile. The captain was made aware (on the first day the fire was noticed) but decided to continue on. It took three days to get to where the fire was, and another day to put the fire out. There were only 3 people to dig out thousands of tons of coal.</p>

<p>The Marconi wireless radio was also down. Radio staff were not hired by White Star Line, and they didn’t take order from the officers, except in times of emergencies. Any radio traffic coming to or from the ship was mostly based on the operators’ whim, and they worked for tips, so mostly they were interested in relaying passenger messages to or from shore. </p>

<p>The radio was down on April 13th, so on the 14th, the operators were scrambling to catch up with the work load. When important messages like Californian’s “Surrounded by ice on all sides” they were ignored, or dismissed by operators – instead of relaying the message to the bridge.</p>

<p>That upset the Californian&#39;s (ship that could have saved the Titanic) radio operator who ended his sift early and didn’t turn on the recorder for his radio (because it would have kept him up). The Titanic’s CQD / SOS messages fell on deaf ears for the Californian.</p>

<p>Murdoch (first officer) died under mysterious circumstances. His body was never recovered. He was one of three officers to die. Gunshots were definitely fired on the ship, but there’s many interpretations of what happened, and all living sources are survivors who may or may not have been a part of the conspiracy.  </p>

<p>The Titanic was supposed to have the “ideal” number of 60 lifeboats – instead it had 16 lifeboats, plus 4 Engelhardt folding lifeboats – less than half the number required for the passenger and crew capacity of 3000. </p>

<p>The lifeboat problem was exacerbated by poor procedure. Only at the last few did lifeboats leave full; at first, many left partly empty because passengers were not queued up to them. Second Officer Herbert Lightoller (who lived) took the instruction “Women and Children first” so literally that he let lifeboats leave with empty spaces rather than let men or boys as young as thirteen aboard. He was never reprimanded for such flagrant violation of procedure. It is estimated that 1200 could have been saved instead of just over 700 people.</p>

<p>According to “official accounts” all the people on the following list willingly forfeited their lives when there were open seats leaving on lifeboats.</p>

<p>The Businessmen and Women who were aboard the Titanic and perished (some of whom were vocal and powerful critics of the Federal Reserve):
Along with 1,514 other people </p>

<ul>
<li><p>American millionaire John Jacob Astor IV – who supposedly opted for one last cigar after being told that women and children would board life-boats first. </p></li>
<li><p>Irish businessman Thomas Andrews, (overseen the ships construction)
American millionaire Benjamin Guggenheim (critic of Fed) –supposedly played a hand of cards as the ship sank after escorting his date onto a life-boat. </p></li>
<li><p>Ira Strauss (critic of Fed)</p></li>
<li><p>American owner of the Macy’s Department Store – Isidor Straus, and his wife, Ida</p></li>
<li><p>Canadian Railroad President Charles Hays</p></li>
<li><p>American cricket player John Borland Thayer</p></li>
<li><p>English journalist William Thomas Stead</p></li>
<li><p>American military aid Major Archibald Willingham Butt</p></li>
<li><p>American writer Jacques Futrelle</p></li>

<p>I mean, this is a really interesting topic - the rise of huge companies, especially in places like banking is undoubtedly interesting to read about and obviously to my knowledge if one of them stories contained killing over a thousand people by copying a book, then having a Hollywood movie about it, that&#39;d be pretty remarkable. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unfair to say that the burden for evidence is on you in that case?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to be an asshole here, I&#39;ll assume you&#39;re a smart guy. On that basis I&#39;ll go ahead and assume you didn&#39;t just copy, paste and reformat from a message board to here without verifying what you claim to be a fact is true. So clearly you have evidence that convinced you that what you posted is worth discussion. Why can&#39;t you post the evidence you gathered so that an actually productive conversation can be had about the topic? </p>

<p>If you&#39;re here to look for the truth, surely you&#39;d like to discuss your findings? Isn&#39;t it a bit arrogant to keep that evidence to yourself and just give us a stream of facts and assume we&#39;ll just take them as true?</p>

Tesla was now at the mercy of Morgan and Tesla&#39;s wireless system (which Morgan discarded since there was no way to charge for such a service, forcing people to use the AC/DC system which could be charged) was sunk too.</p>

<p>Morgan&#39;s opponents were not against the FED specifically, because like you said Federal Reserve had not even been proposed yet, but they <em>were</em> against central banking the way the FED would have been and was set up. So they would have never accepted the plan for the FED if it had come to light before their deaths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct that researchers have had a difficult time connecting Astor with opposing the Federal Reserve, other than his history of philanthropy that was markedly different from the other men of his stature like Morgan and Rockefeller, who are known to have had very few scruples.</p>

<p>I will one up this particularly conspiracy by saying that what we <em>do</em> know is that Astor was <em>very</em> interested and supportive of the research and ideas of <em>Nikola Tesla</em>.</p>

<p>In fact, Astor, had he survived, may have become one of Tesla&#39;s greatest benefactors, and his struggles for financial help and eventually drifting into obscurity may never have occurred. </p>

<p>After all, it&#39;s very widely known about how Morgan pulled the plug on Tesla&#39;s dreams (and funding) when he found out that Tesla wanted to share power, wirelessly and free, to the entire world.</p>

<p>Astor would&#39;ve been on board, but sadly he was &quot;on board&quot; the wrong ship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, the Federal Reserve Act had many opponents <strong>in 1913</strong>, but not in April 1912.</p>

<p>The opponents to the Federal Reserve Act were almost completely different from the opponents to Aldrich&#39;s National Reserve plan. There was no way to tell in April 1912 who would be opposed to a plan that didn&#39;t exist.</p>
