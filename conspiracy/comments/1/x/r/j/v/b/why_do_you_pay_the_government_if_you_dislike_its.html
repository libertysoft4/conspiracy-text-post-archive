    <div class="md"><p>To be clear, I&#39;m not paying them any longer.</p>

<p>I am not afraid of their threats.</p>

<p>According to their laws and rules they have nothing to support any claims against me that I am subject to their laws and rules. I assume they will come after me at some point. They have no facts to which they may point that their claims against me are of any validity. Without evidence they cannot prosecute me. If they force a conviction they violate due process and so I won on appeal.</p>

<p>And so I will no longer pay them.</p>

<p>Their threats of jail do not sway me.</p>

<p>They will claim a right to my money. Without evidence that they have a right to my money they have no right to my money. There is nothing that I know of that can prove that their laws, dictates and codes have anything to do with me. Other than threats of violence. Which constitute duress.

<p>So far as I can tell if you argue law you lose. If you request that they prove with evidence that their codes apply you win. The idea, simply, is that they&#39;re claiming that they have a right to your money. Ask them for proof of this claim and they have nothing.</p>

Ideally I&#39;d like to cease all payment of all monies to anything to do with the U.S. Federal government. However they may decide to take interest in me. In which case they&#39;ll seek legal recourse. I am not rich and so I can only give them so much of my time and life. The biggest slice is the Federal Income Tax; which is also how ObamaCare will be enforced. So I will hit the biggest one since I only have so much time and life - for them to steal in court and litigation.</p>

<p>In order to take anything from me they must first establish that they have a right to my possessions and property. They have no evidence to back up their claims. Without evidence to verify that they have a right to my money and property they cannot legally take what is mine.</p>

<p>They are liars, cheats and thugs, however, the public arena is the only thing keeping them from naked aggression. Their Achilles heel is that they need to look legitimate in the eyes of the public. Force them to adhere to their own rules and they&#39;re as helpless as kittens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>in brief:</p>

<p>the 16th amendment to the constitution is what &#39;allows&#39; the government to collect INCOME taxes.</p>

<p>INCOME as specified in that amendment was DEFINED by the Supreme Court as &#39;Income Derived from Corporate Profits&#39;  .. note this is NOT the individual, it is the whole corp.</p>

<p>This is the basis that people say the IRS is illegal .. and they are right!</p>

<p>However the IRS ignores this and to make it worse the courts refuse to use the precedent and definition set by the supreme court, so you get fined or go to jail or both.</p>

<p>Its blatantly against the US Constitution, but what can you do?</p>

<p>If you get taken to court and your case is high profile you may just get away with it (a few ex-IRS employees have been aquitted, however most people go to jail)</p>

<p>Aaron Russo&#39;s excellent documentary &#39;From Freedom to Facism&#39; explains it all, probably better than I did</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A birth certificate is not evidence of anything other than that you were born.</p>

<p>If the claim is that you&#39;re subject to their laws and jurisdiction I would wonder if they&#39;re claiming whether or not they own us. If they&#39;re claiming that the birth certificate is evidence that they own us I would simply cite their own rules that slavery and indentured servitude are illegal in the United States. If they&#39;re claiming that a birth certificate is an agreement on the infant&#39;s part that it&#39;s a citizen I would cite their own rules that minors cannot legally be held in contract. If they&#39;re claiming that the parents are claiming that the infant is a citizen I would wonder how it is that another may consent on the behalf of another. Particularly if the other is a minor and unable to enter into contract. If the claim is that the birth certificate is that physical location is evidence of citizenship you could simply point to any Mexican immigrant and note that they&#39;re physically in the U.S. and not a citizen.</p>

<p>No, a birth certificate is not evidence of citizenship.</p>

<p>My payment to a tax company has nothing to do with whether or not U.S. laws apply to me.</p>

<p>The idea is that all citizens must pay tribute [Federal Income Tax]. They must first prove that I&#39;m a citizen. They must prove that I&#39;m within the body politic. The body politic is an abstraction. It&#39;s a mental object. They can&#39;t prove that I&#39;m within said mental object.

    <div class="md"><p>Citizens may be government subjects, but I don&#39;t see how that has anything to do with me. In order to renounce citizenship you must first be a citizen. In order to renounce citizenship you must also regard the body from which you&#39;re breaking as in some way legitimate. I see nothing to prove that I&#39;m a citizen and I don&#39;t regard the U.S. Federal government as a legitimate body with authority or jurisdiction over me.</p>

<p>And really, it&#39;s unimportant to me to think about these kinds of things at this point in my life. I simply don&#39;t care. Yeah, I&#39;d like to go to Sri Lanka and Nepal and Egypt. I&#39;m not rich so I can&#39;t afford vacations and air-fare. So it&#39;s not even within my ability to contemplate such things. </p>

<p>I&#39;m here and my life is here. Some people in D.C. may claim that they&#39;re my lords, masters and owners, but I&#39;m not really impressed by their claims. I do, however, know that they will threaten me with violence and make good on their promise given the chance. I have no illusions that I&#39;m dealing with anything other than a band of sub-criminal psychopaths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To abide by or recognize their statutes would be to recognize them as having authority and jurisdiction over me. I do not regard them as having authority or jurisdiction over me and so changing their statutes seems like a waste of time. </p>

<p>I would also say that they cannot take your personhood. How they regard your personhood is meaningless. Who cares if an illegitimate body of self-appointed rulers doesn&#39;t recognize you? Fuck those guys. I don&#39;t need their recognition and don&#39;t really care what they think so long as they leave me alone.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right where I was but a year or two ago. I know your mindset and I even sympathize with it to a large degree. Now, though, I simply cannot recognize a body of people imposing themselves on me as having anything over me other than threats of violence.</p>

<p>Their law is their law and I want nothing to do with it. I&#39;m all about what&#39;s right. Not what&#39;s legal. Certainly not what&#39;s legal in the eyes of a band of liars, cheats, murderers and scoundrels. My family and friends look after me and I look after them. That is the only law I observe. I help people who need help and I contribute to things that make the world at least a little better. The ultimate law, in my eyes, is dictated by whether or not I can fall asleep at night knowing that I did the right thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Opinion vs. facts.</p>

<p>They have opinions which can&#39;t be backed by facts.</p>

<p>I win by default.</p>

<p>Yeah, I know what you mean, about the 14th Amendment. I looked into it. I think it&#39;s total bullshit. I also think that if the only thing backing their claims to authority are guns they&#39;re totally illegitimate and unworthy of recognition as anything but thugs and scoundrels. I will not participate in the schemes of thugs and scoundrels. </p>

<p>Since people have been trying to beg and force the government to be god for a very long time without success I&#39;m of the opinion that the proof is &quot;reality&quot; itself. It&#39;s a bullshit system run by psychopaths and it&#39;s not broken at all. It works perfectly. It works exactly as they want it to work. And they have no reason to change it at all.</p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t mean all is lost. It only means that a new avenue must be sought. New roads can be built and new models of interaction must be examined. People like you are what civilization needs and for you to put your time into a bullshit system is a waste of your life. I can tell that you&#39;re a caring and decent person. I think that giving yourself over to such people as those within the U.S. Federal government would be a travesty. They don&#39;t deserve someone compelled by ethics and morals. They&#39;re unworthy. That sounds really high and mighty - maybe it is - but it&#39;s how I feel.</p>

<p>Truly I don&#39;t know what the golden society would look like. </p>

<p>I just know I don&#39;t like this one.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m not going to support it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone who studies the civil war knows it wasn&#39;t about slavery. As such it&#39;s not racist at all. It&#39;s simply what happened. The motives on the part of the people acting at the time may have been racist, but acknowledging that they did such things is not racist. If you don&#39;t know what happened in the past you don&#39;t know why things are the way they are. Bad shit happened. Other people did it. You can&#39;t take it back. But you can learn from it. Use that knowledge to make the world a better place and it&#39;s okay. </p>

<p>And, yes, I agree that they ended up enslaving everyone rather than just a few. They expanded the slavery to all people. The current manifestation becomes painfully obvious when you go to Wal-Mart and look at the employees. All colors, creeds, sexes, religions, political beliefs and minecraft player types; they&#39;re all slaves. </p>

<p>Your understanding that the battle is in the mind is of primary concern to me these days. It is in the mind. We have been brought up to assume that authority is correct and that we exist within a particular model of &quot;reality.&quot; Ironically, the one enforcing your enslavement is yourself!</p>

<p>You&#39;re moving into the sovereign citizen rhetoric and I would caution you not to take them too seriously. I understand what they mean and I even agree to a large extent, however, in a court of law their tactics don&#39;t have a good track record. My main concern is what work in the real world. I&#39;m interested in deflecting the attacks of the IRS and the method I&#39;m adopting has a high success rate. I&#39;m dealing with thugs and I have to be careful. I know I&#39;m right, but that doesn&#39;t stop a liar and a cheat from cheating and lying. One of the things a sovereign citizen will do in court is make an assertion. Judges love it when you make an assertion because they can over-rule the assertion rendering it irrelevant. I will use no such tactic. Aikido. I will let them destroy themselves.</p>

<p>Fuck not with my <a href="http://youtu.be/y-tmbrUCR6Y">tiger style</a>.</p>

<p>The fact that you&#39;ve thought everything to this degree suggests much. You, as I, have much to learn and much to share. In the movie &quot;<a href="http://youtu.be/DPCRmbaNkkU">My Dinner With Andre</a>&quot; Andre talks about the secret college hidden from the brutal totalitarian state. I would regard you as been a member of the college.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The state is not the ground. The state is the body politic. </p>

<p>The body politic is a mental construct; it&#39;s imaginary. There&#39;s no way to prove that you&#39;re a member of this imaginary entity. Whether or not you were born on a given piece of land is not evidence that yo&#39;re a member of the body politic. An infant cannot possibly be expected to understand and agree to citizenship upon birth.</p>

<p>Think of it this way:</p>

<p>Without standing the court can&#39;t hear the case. Standing means that three criteria must be met:</p>

<p>1.) Injury</p>

<p>2.) Causation</p>

<p>3.) Redressability</p>

<p>The injury that the IRS will claim will be your lack of compliance with their demands. In their words, &quot;We own you, you must obey and you didn&#39;t obey. How dare you injure us by breaking our commandments!&quot; Their claims of authority rest on the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution applies only if you&#39;re a citizen. There is no evidence that you&#39;re a U.S. Citizen. If there&#39;s no evidence that you&#39;re a citizen then their claims / laws are irrelevant. They were never injured (despite their claims) and so they have no standing which means the court can&#39;t hear the case. Dismissed!</p>

<p>Citizenship means you&#39;re a member of the body politic owing allegiance in exchange for a duty to protect. They would have to show that you&#39;re a member of the body politic. They have jurisdiction if and only if you&#39;re a member of the body politic. Their body politic is purely fictional and you never agreed to it. In terms of contract law they must offer and you must accept. No such transaction occurred. In terms of ownership or slavery no one sold you and even if they did slavery is illegal within the U.S. - I would also want to see the papers that show you&#39;re owned by someone.</p>

<p>If the burden of proof rests on the plaintiff they must prove jurisdiction. They cannot do this. They have no way of positively proving that you&#39;re a citizen. Everyone assumes that they&#39;re citizens and so they don&#39;t even bother to wonder about it. Once you start objecting the judge and the prosecution are in a bind. Because they are then forced to either prove something that is not provable or they have to dismiss the charges. Frequently the charges are dropped before you even get to court. </p>

<p>Does that make sense?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I don&#39;t.</p>

<p>I need no representation. I&#39;m learning about court procedure and the various motions. Also I don&#39;t need to prove anything and there&#39;s nothing with which to incriminate myself. I have injured no one and the nature of the claims against me hinge on the claim that their laws and codes apply to me. I can&#39;t accidentally give evidence that doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>Also, lots people represent themselves and lots of those people win.</p>

<p>Lawyers are just people. I&#39;m no better and no worse than any man.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not afraid of men.</p>
