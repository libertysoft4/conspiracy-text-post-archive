    <div class="md"><p>Thanks man.  All the people I smoke and kick it with are so busy with work they dont know about any of this stuff. Of course there is the rare exception, but that is few and far between.  it just sucks so bad that someone so brave and awesome like Hastings could be murdered so openly, and no one cares.  I know more of us are out there.  I will keep the faith, thanks for the encouragement</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right on man.  I&#39;m 22 and fresh out of college. It seemed to me like everybody my age was too busy worrying about getting drunk and laid to be angry about the injustice of it all.  Once I got drunk and laid enough, I dropped some acid and that is how I realized I need to focus on what really matters.  I desperately hope youre right though, and I do everything I can all the time to wake up our generation.  I&#39;m always talking about this stuff.  I say give it a while, i dont want to be pessimistic but maybe a decade or two, and then we will see massive changes.  For now i&#39;m just planting seeds :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was actually talking about LSD last night - I am somewhat convinced that one thing missing from modern society is the &#39;self-realization&#39; sort of battle.  Like when Luke Skywalker encountered Darth Vader during his training with Yoda and found out that it was himself under the mask - he experienced his greatest fears and realized them. Understood them. Eventually conquered them (and became them, but thats a later story).</p>

<p>Anyways, Lucas worked closely with Joseph Campbell and if you haven&#39;t seen or read any of his works, you most definitely should. &#39;The Hero&#39;s Journey&quot; is a fantastic read and makes how our brains work and evolution of society sort of make more sense from a long term standpoint. </p>

<p>Relevancy: we don&#39;t have the inner battle fight as a part of our modern society. I think LSD, under the correct set and setting can be used to elicit those feelings and make a person stronger.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.
—Joseph Campbell, The Hero With a Thousand Faces </p>

    <div class="md"><p>my friends think im nuts.</p>

<p>I think I talk too much, I started off a few years ago with Food Inc and agri-business, then 911, then the FED stuff, and most recently I found out and believe that Sandyhook was fake .. I havn&#39;t talked about that one yet though.</p>

<p>I recommend all the docs, but they all think I should just live life.  One guy sorta believes 911 was an inside job but thats as far as he will go.</p>

<p>as for the financial collapse coming, he thinks it will be at least 50 years.  Im pretty sure there won&#39;t be a USA in 50 years.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll all be one big (unhappy) world family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeap. Also, one thing mainstream media <em>has</em> covered in the past year or so is the persecution/prosecution of whistleblowers and journalists critical of the administration. James Rosen, James Risen, Sharyl Atkisson&#39;s computer being hacked while she was working on Benghazi stories, the Justice Dept&#39;s seizing of AP phone records, Greenwald&#39;s spouse being detained, the IRS&#39;s special-negative-treatment for conservative groups, and so on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh she&#39;s an educator and many of her peers do realize a lot of these things.</p>

<p>If your mom knows her bible then she should be receptive to these things as the bible states how corrupt man is, she should assume the government is corrupt really, because time and time again the bible reveals how insanely corrupt people are, especially when placed in government.</p>

<p>Murder, lies, deception, conspiracy, all throughout the bible, which is why I find it so absurd that other Christians are hostile to the idea that their own government is corrupt.</p>

<p>It makes sense though when you realize &quot;oh yeah, the older generation (35 and up really) have all been extremely heavily brainwashed.&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THANK YOU!!!  She doesnt get this, nobody gets this.  My favorite bible story is when jesus goes in his fathers house with a whip and flips over the corrupt merchant peoples&#39; tables and shit.  i try and explain all the time how questioning government is as christian as it fucking gets.  Another unfortunate side effect of the psy-op known as 9/11 (imo), it entrenched &quot;our side&quot;&quot;christianity&quot; with the american government in a lot of weak minds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no wonder the church is in such a state of ruin and decay when a majority of it&#39;s congregation is brainwashed baby boomers.</p>

<p>It&#39;s scary because when you debate them in person you can see in their eyes and on their faces and in their bodies when they&#39;re confronted with something that doesn&#39;t fit with their beliefs. Instantly you can see this reaction and their display is that of an almost instant jump to defensive.</p>

<p>You can tell when they&#39;re gonna chime in by listening to how they&#39;re breathing and be able to know when they&#39;re going to respond with hostility, or disbelief, or denial.</p>

<p>Psychologically conditioned people have no idea how easy it is to predict them.</p>

<p>It takes a lot of effort to shed yourself of societal psychological conditioning, but once you accomplish this you become far harder to direct and control.</p>

<p>Active Neutrality gains you an advantage in that you don&#39;t let people have the ability to modify their behavior nor do you give them the ability to guide your responses or mold your answer through suggestion.</p>

<p>People are crafty as hell ( to which many are bound sadly ), you have to always keep your guard up, even with friends because even though at times they may have good intentions, even they go too far in trying to change you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Active Neutrality is just that, actively retaining a position which doesn&#39;t allow people to force your decisions/behaviors.</p>

<p>Common practices include responding to peoples statements with vague non-agreements such as &quot;Ok&quot;.</p>

<p>I work a retail job and they constantly are telling me &quot;You have to talk up gift cards, gift cards are a great gift blah blah blah blah&quot; and all I say to that shit is &quot;Ok&quot; for a multitude of reasons.</p>

<p>Reason one being that gift cards are a fucking scam so businesses can ensure money through the hopes that customers lose/forget about their gift cards and never spend that money.</p>

<p>Secondly, they&#39;re a fucking awful gift. Wow, thanks for the money I can only spend at this one place. Why did you not just give me the fucking money?</p>

<p>In remaining actively neutral towards what they present me with, I retain my own individual thoughts and beliefs, while still being able to carry out what is asked of me ( I don&#39;t like to do it but it takes 3 seconds to say &quot;any gift cards today?&quot; and they really only push this so hard when there are holidays like the hallmark bullshit that happened yesterday. )</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The police have said that no foul play was involved.</p>

<p>Hastings family had flown into town for an intervention for his drug habit.</p>

<p>He has a history of drug abuse.</p>

<p>Coronor&#39;s report says drugs were in his system (but did not contribute to the accident)</p>

<p>He had a history of crashing his car.</p>

<p>He was overly paranoid about the government watching him and was trying to borrow his friends car.</p>

<p>Eyewitnesses see him bottom his car out on the crest of the intersection just before he crashed. (sparks and flames flying out from under the car - not a bomb)</p>

<p>There is video showing him flying past a stringer&#39;s camera at an intersection a couple of blocks before he crashed. </p>

<p>Michael Hastings</p>
</blockquote>

<p>on one of his last TV appearances, he openly called another journalist a tame copy/paster for the PTB, jaws dropped on that show.</p>

<p>he was clearly stressed from working, on that TV show, no doubt he got played like a fish, somebody did something to his car, then they drew him through that (regular!) route and closed the trap.</p>

<p>its telling that the Loudlabs arrival video shows all the vehicles at the scene on a cleared street. the parked up tow-truck, the ADT vehicle at the north end of the crash scene, the other parked up car, the distant moving car with flashing lights way down the street south, that moves off as LL car arrives. </p>

<p>there was four vehicles at the scene when the camera car arrived in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>the HD version of the dashcam video clearly shows the south vehicle with flashing white/orange lights in the distance, the south blocking car, the ADT one was the north blocking car.</p>

<p>the pizza store CCTV video, short and edited tho it is, it almost shows a speeding car going past a stationary car by the tree, there seems to be a hint of a sideways wreck illuminated by the first big explosion, not enough frames/time for a real crash.</p>

<p>Michael Hastings, a young eager and ambitious investigative journalist, a &#39;loose canon&#39;, not a &#39;team player&#39;, many wanted him to disappear or not exist any more.</p>

<p>As far as I heard the LAPD have kept all the records on the investigation private, which was over in a few weeks I believe.</p>

<p>The LAPD does this shit all the time. At first I thought they&#39;d try to cover it up better but honestly I think it&#39;s just a message. If you have important information and are going to publish, keep your mouth fucking shut or we&#39;ll kill you. No one talks about it but anyone with half a brain in the journalism world has probably noticed.</p>

<p>The United States is not safe for journalists who stick to their principals.</p>

They were living across the country from each other and she&#39;s got some interesting connections. (As does he, if you really dig into it.

<p>Think about how fking crazy what you propose sounds.</p>

<p>SO what you are saying, is that a guy that is having problems with DRUGS, stress and lack of sleep and may have been having a &quot;manic&quot; episode decides to drive like an idiot and ends up crashing his car into a tree doesn&#39;t make as much sense as an evil govt spooky black ops assassin team ordered by Stanley McChrystal tampered with the guys car, then took control of it remotely and crashed it into a tree in a revenge killing over political embarrassment?</p>

<p>A guy that is having a &quot;moment&quot; accidently kills himself vs. secret black ops govt assassins using high tech to take control of a car and then drive it into a tree in a revenge killing.</p>

<p>REALLY? Think about that nonsense...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not so &quot;high tech&quot; or as impossible as you make it sound.
Look into Washington State University experiment where they prooved that just about every car made in the last ten years or so is easily susceptible to having their connections through OnStar/GPS/Radio intercepted.  They used this interception to access the electrical control system and were able to do anything from controlling the speed to brakes to even the locks.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>YOU ARE REEEEEACHING.
THERE IS NOTHING THERE.</p>

<p>Ok...lets say it isn&#39;t so &quot;high tech&quot;. </p>

<p>STILL - it would be easier to just shoot the guy in the face and make it look like  robbery. Happens all the time around here. Make it look like a drug deal gone bad. Happens all the time.
You can keep down the number of people involved. No evidence to get rid of. Its done and nobody knows a thing. 
Why not simply make him disappear? That&#39;s pretty easy for our govt to do. He goes to take leak while watching some hockey with his boys and POOF he disappears.  He takes the dog for a walk around the neighborhood and never comes back. Easy.
Why not make it look like an OD? He was a drug user. Easy as shit to set him up for that. Just another sad story about a drug user ODing. End of story.</p>

<p>But no. Somebody &quot;hacks&quot; this guys car. Without any sort of evidence or any sort prior incident to fall back on...THEY - the internet - claims it was a high tech murdering using his own Mercedes.</p>

<p>Claiming that a shadowy govt organization hell bent on getting revenge used this method to kill a guy is just silly. ALL of the evidence points to a RATIONAL conclusion that he was driving fast - REAL FAST - went out of control and hit a tree.</p>

<p>Why do you guys discount the brother? He was really the last guy to spend any time with him. Knew him better than anybody. Actually flew out here just to stay with him because he know that Hastings was using again. He said that Hastings wasn&#39;t sleeping. Was under stress. The words he used to describe what happened to Hastings was &quot;having manic incident&quot;. In other words, he was freaking out.</p>

<p>YOU GUYS have even tried to tell me that his brother wasn&#39;t to be trusted and could be a govt &quot;plant&quot; or was forced to say that stuff by the govt or face being killed himself. WTF???</p>

<p>All the signs are there. There is NOTHING that would point, in the smallest way, to General McChrystal and a band of secret Blackwater assassins or CIA hitmen using technology to &quot;hack&quot; this guys car. Just internet nonsense. Murdering an American citizen on American soil to get revenge because Hastings embarrassed them? Or that Hastings future work might be able to embarrass them?</p>

<p>WHEN has ANYTHING like that ever happened before? In the movies? TV shows? It hasn&#39;t happened in real life. There are no prior incidents of this sort of thing  to look back on and say - THAT is what probably happened to Hastings. Its pure paranoia and silly conspiracy. It was just &quot;made up&quot; by the internet.</p>

<p>YOU/THEY are looking to find conspiracy where there isn&#39;t and coming up very short and looking silly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I explained to you that the possibility of wirelessly accessing a vehicle control system is within the bounds of common reality.  Doing so creates the illusion that this journalist crashed his car, despite the fact that he was going over 80mph in a neighborhood with ZERO alcohol in his system.</p>

<p>If you then fabricate a rumor that he was using drugs you can gain enough traction through hearsay to have people seriously questioning his character, thus ignoring his history and strange death by accepting the fact that he deserved it somehow.</p>

<p>The email he sent right before he died literally said he was on to a big story.  If you look it up or remember it said he found something big and might need to lay low for a while, or something along those lines but seriously look it up and read it.</p>

<p>If you take into account his history with exposing large government mistakes, and you can entertain the idea that extreme measures would be taken to deceive the public if such an assassination were to occur, then I think you would realize that his death at least warrants an investigation.</p>

<p>I am the one trying to &quot;taint his legacy&quot;? </p>

<p>YOU are the one that is saying a shadowy govt organization secretly tampered with his car, then took over control of it and forced it into a tree at high speed.
YOU are saying that this was done as a revenge killing because he embarrassed General McChrystal, or they wanted to murder him to prevent further embarrassment because he was writing a new book or a new article.</p>

<p>Are you fucking serious? Seen too many movies have you?</p>

<p>THAT is not &quot;tainting&quot; his legacy? Are you out of your fucking mind? I suppose you think that his brother, the guy who knew him more than anybody, is &quot;tainting his legacy&quot;? Go ahead. SAY IT. Tell us that his brother is &quot;tainting his legacy&quot;. Because HE is the one that was saying these things, that I can rationally and logically agree with.</p>

<p>&quot;But the govt may be threatening his brother also...&quot; - Shut the fuck up stupid...</p>

<p>YOU are trying to create a &quot;conspiracy&quot; where there isn&#39;t. YOU are the one &quot;tainting his legacy&quot;. Stop being a drama queen.</p>

<p>Im sorry that I try to keep my opinions about most things firmly and rationally rooted in reality and not some twisted internet fantasy world based around an evil cat petting James Bond character who sought out revenge on a reporter and used technology to control the guys car and murder him.</p>
