I am a smoker myself and am thrilled that the ball is finally rolling to get this stuff legal and regulated, should have been done forever ago. However the timing and the speed at which it is happening is startling. Could be something, could be nothing. What do you think? </p>

<p>Just seems like a good way to make a rather large chunk of the country think of the government as a little better than it is and distract the ones who are against it away from other issues. Think Ill keep my tin foil hat on for now.</p>

<p>I think OP is asking &quot;why now?&quot;</p>

<p>If it was just up to popular opinion weed would have been legal in the 1960&#39;s. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s not only &quot;citizens&quot;, there are politicians who are fighting for legalization as well, perhaps for the first time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heres the thing I think if the ptb really thought it was a threat to their long standing rulership over the plebes they wouldn&#39;t let it go through. I do think the states have kind of taken the reins over the fed on this one. Now they&#39;re requesting the fed reclassify it as a schedule 2 or 3 instead of schedule 1 (which makes no sense anyways cannabis being schedule 1). </p>

<p>A lot of money could be made from hemp and hemp products if the tech was allowed to bloom and it woud reduce environmental impact insofar as reducing the amount of trees we need to float our society. In addition to many other applications. Maybe reduce some of the societal costs of alcohol consumption by switching to cannabis instead. </p>

<p>Many net benefits. We need the money right now, and its a whole new tax base they could be bringing in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good point.

<p>Thats because... they make &amp; enforce the laws? In order for anything to change, the officials have to be convinced to hop on board (or, more likely, new officials are elected who are on board.) That&#39;s how any form of governance works.</p>

<p>Except anarchy, I guess, but that&#39;s a whole different ball of wax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They kept marijuana legalization as a back up. Obviously the government can do whatever it wants. It wouldn&#39;t have to legalize weed for another 2 decades if they really decided to. So they took away many of our rights since 2001 (and much before then, but that is when it accelerated), and now there is a massive scandal and the public is starting to heat up. They took away X amount of rights until we became angry, and now they&#39;re giving one right back to calm us down. </p>

In the case of politics, the phrase is used to describe the creation of public approval, not through exemplary or excellent public service or public policy, but through diversion; distraction; or the mere satisfaction of the immediate, shallow requirements of a populace,[1] as an offered &quot;palliative.&quot; Juvenal decried it as a simplistic motivation of common people.[2][3][4] The phrase also implies the erosion or ignorance of civic duty amongst the concerns of the commoner.</p>

And i&#39;m sitting here like &quot;well weed shouldn&#39;t have been illegal to begin with and you ruined so many peoples lives with the drug war. and gays should have the same rights as anyone else. and I don&#39;t give a shit about alcohol.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, there&#39;s another more sinister reasoning behind it, I think. The issue that weed is both legalized AND illegal at the same time. Remember all of the California legitimate weed growers that got busted by the Feds? People are all cheering for this legalization of pot, but they won&#39;t be cheering when they all have a record. The Feds won&#39;t legalize it even if your states do, and then there&#39;s the issue of your job firing you for dirty urine tests, yeah jobs aren&#39;t all for it either. Everyone is going to have a &quot;record&quot;. It is so easy to be arrested or be put on some kind of court database now, when they start making things illegal and legal at the same time a lot of people are going to end up with charges on their records now. Sorry, I want no part of the court system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy fucking shit, dude. I&#39;m glad I&#39;ve found a place where I&#39;m not labeled an unpatriotic asshole for believing and even just thinking about these things. </p>

<p>That being said, this idea you have here, <strong>holy shit.</strong></p>

<p><em>random, lengthy, semi-relevant anecdote</em> A year ago, I dabbled in trees. Haven&#39;t since May &#39;13, because the risk/benefit ratio wasn&#39;t personally appealing to me. I haven&#39;t kept up with all the legislation/movement to get it legalized, as I&#39;m generally drug-/alcohol-free anyway, and one more vice being legal wouldn&#39;t mean too much to me. Not for any moral reasons, just not my cup of tea. I figured if it ever got fully legalized, I&#39;d you know, partake socially, like maybe at a party every once in a while. But now that you spell it out like that, I think you may have just swayed me away from it all entirely.</p>

<p><strong>a theory I have relating to yours</strong> What you said about it wanting to get us all into a court system, that kind of goes along with what I&#39;ve been thinking about, with things like Google Glass. I think it&#39;s not a matter of if we eventually all get personalized computers built into our brains, it&#39;s a matter of when. Along with that, obviously whoever is in charge at that time will have direct control over/links/a watch on all of our brain computers. <em>Your idea</em> sounds like it might be a way to speed up their &quot;justifications&quot; of getting links into us, you know, if we all have court records of some sort, that&#39;s obviously how they&#39;d try to get people to be okay with that, you feel me man?</p>

<p>That sounds pretty far-fetched and a bit far off, but still, my meds have wore off, its 4:13 in the morning, so I&#39;m a bit rambly.  </p>

<p>Anyway, thank you for your comment, I am glad I found this community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I attribute this momentum toward legalization to the fact that the WWII/&quot;greatest&quot; generation has almost completely died off.  Someone who was 18 in 1945 is now 88.  All WWII veterans are now past their life expectancy.  </p>

<p>Marijuana was never part of that generation&#39;s culture; coupled with attitudes that were more overtly racist than those that prevail today, this resulted in support for prohibition.  Politicians who support legalization do not risk the wrath of the &quot;greatest&quot; the way they did 10 years ago.</p>

<p>I also guess that Obama secretly supports full legalization.  The federal government could crush legalization if it wanted to; instead it seems to be (very) hesitantly helping it along, as evidenced by recent efforts to help Colorado shops get access to banking.  Structural realities mean it can&#39;t happen overnight, but I have my fingers crossed that we&#39;ll see a re-scheduling by December 2016.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I look at this from a different perspective.  We have been told for so long in previous years of how harmful and destructive marijuana is to our bodies and to our society.  When I tried it myself a few years ago, I realized that I have been lied to for so long and it made me think that we are being fed a cocktail of fallacies and propaganda from a tyrannical and controlling government.  If they are trying so hard to forbid this from us, who knows what other things they are trying to manipulate out of and into our hands.  If anything, smoking marijuana has opened my eyes to this oppression, and I feel that many others will soon follow once it is legalized.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. It&#39;s just like gay rights. Dangling a carrot in front of a flogged to death horse.</p>

<p>If they didn&#39;t want it legalized it wouldn&#39;t be legalized. Its throwing scraps at the people to keep them under the illusions the system works and that the people are free.</p>

<p>All whilst continuing the movements of censoring out internet, globalizing corporations and removing sovereignty with the TPP, continuing the war machine and prepping for more war on syria and iran.</p>

<p>Giving the people little glimmers of hope like this just keeps them asleep. I have conversations with people telling them what the system actually is and that we are all free range slaves and they use the gay rights thing as evidence that we are wrong... Its just for show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s nothing.  States have been trying to get it legalized for years.  The youth has always wanted it, old folks stuck in there ways.  Not so much, but as old folks die theres less [old]opposition.</p>

<p>Colorado finally got the right majority in this and got it passed.  Other states watched as they didn&#39;t fall apart but instead saw the nice rise in revenue and started pushing it themselves.  Once one state passes it without a hitch, it&#39;s far easier to convince everyone else.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t put this on distraction grounds mainly because there was a couple states (I believe) that went the opposite direction and actually increased the severity of their possession laws.</p>

<p>It was a morality law that spawned a terrible psuedo-war that did no good and only harm and enough finally came around and said it was time to start ending it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Say they make it legal state wise, not federally, everyone starts smoking and what not... Couple years down the line the Feds come in &quot;Hey you&#39;re doing something illegal&quot; </p>

<p>Us: &quot;But it&#39;s legal within state laws&quot; 
Them: &quot;Doesn&#39;t matter, illegal on a federal level, now get on that truck to the FEMA camp.&quot;</p>

<p>Lol, just speculation but I could see them pulling some bullshit like that.</p>

<p>Edit: Maybe not to that extreme.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking of this little theory</p>

<p>With the NSA tracking everything we do ok it&#39;s not a like they listen in to everyone but there&#39;s knowing that they have the ability too which bugs me. Say they have a video of someone posted on Facebook of them smoking a spliff when it&#39;s legal in their state then when they crack down on everyone who breaks the federal law they have evidence and bang your in a FEMA camp !!! (I&#39;m talking when shit goes off and it&#39;s time to herd the masses into slavery) they have the ability by law to do it without supposedly breaking ones rights because it was against &quot;federal law&quot;</p>

<p>But I reckon for now the government will let it go too see how big of a profit can be made and then tax the shit out of it..because we know too well how much they love money and taxing the citizens. Plus the economy needs a boost somehow when things aren&#39;t going to well. Also could be done to build confidence in the system for the younger generation.</p>

<p>Just my theory only time will tell I guess</p>

<p>But on a side note you guys/gals are awesome and make me smile knowing there&#39;s people out there who actually use their brain, much love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I think you are right. However, I am glad that legalization is finally happening. Even if it&#39;s just a ploy to increase the <em>feeling</em> of political efficacy -- and it isn&#39;t actually democracy in action -- ending cannabis prohibition is a big step in the right direction. A win is a win. </p>

<p>The success of the legalization movement has shown us, in a roundabout way, our right to freedom of thought. We have asserted our right to alter our minds in a way that isn&#39;t harmful to other people. This isn&#39;t just a win for that guy you know who spends his days toking on some good sensemilla and watching adult swim. Marijuana legalization is a victory for everybody; even someone who never has and never will smoke weed. Less of their tax money is going to be wasted housing non-violent offenders. Police will have more time to focus on real criminals. Hundreds of thousands if not millions of people will not have their lives ruined by the justice system, which is designed to screw over anyone who tries to improve their life after incarceration (student loans/grants, drivers license, employment).</p>

<p>Nonetheless, we need to remember that while decades of supplication may have worked in this case, it is almost certain that this tactic will not work when it really matters. For example: in recent months it has become increasingly apparent that asking nicely will never stop the NSA from trampling on our first and fourth amendment rights. A couple smart people realized this, and now we are playing hardball: shutting off the NSA&#39;s utilities. We have options people. If writing your representatives doesn&#39;t work, vote for new ones. If that doesn&#39;t work, start a petition. If you still aren&#39;t gaining ground, start an organization. If you still can&#39;t get anything done, start a political action committee. So on and so forth.</p>

<p>The revolution won&#39;t be violent. Sure, old money may control the system, but new money spends just as well. Lobbying is one of the most effective ways to precipitate political action. If big corporations and banks are successfully lining our legislature&#39;s pockets with fat stacks in exchange for laws that benefit them, then maybe we need to become the thing that we hate most. </p>

<p>We are everywhere. People who see what is wrong with the system. We see the strings. We look behind the stage. We see the puppeteers. With time we could cut those strings and show everyone that it was all a farce; but you can&#39;t just cut the strings and expect it to end. Sure, you might stop the show for a minute, a year, or a decade, but eventually the show goes on. Another puppeteer will show up and pick up where the last one let off. He will continue to serve his own selfish interests; the same interests that motivated the long lineage of puppeteers before him. It will never stop until the cycle is broken.</p>

<p>So if you really want to fix our shattered system, then become the puppeteer.</p>

<p>Stoners are the most useless form of rebel because their acts of rebellion never go farther than their keyboards the number of proactive pot users resisting the government compared to the number of pot users overall who would never lift a finger to resist even if people were being murdered in the streets is such an extreme divide as to make the entire drug culture and everyone in it not worth bothering about</p>

I do think the states have kind of taken the reins over the fed on this one. Now they&#39;re requesting the fed reclassify it as a schedule 2 or 3 instead of schedule 1 (which makes no sense anyways cannabis being schedule 1). </p>

<p>A lot of money could be made from hemp and hemp products if the tech was allowed to bloom and it woud reduce environmental impact insofar as reducing the amount of trees we need to float our society. In addition to many other applications. Maybe reduce some of the societal costs of alcohol consumption by switching to cannabis instead. </p>

<p>Many net benefits. We need the money right now, and its a whole new tax base they could be bringing in. </p>
