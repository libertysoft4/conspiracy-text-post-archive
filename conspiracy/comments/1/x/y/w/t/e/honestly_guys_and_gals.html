<p><strong>This rant is not directed at you personally, just at the tone of your post that I have seen repeated in other places as well:</strong></p>

<p>Stop using the term &quot;we&quot;.  If you want things to change, do something about it. I&#39;m not saying you have to protest and get arrested, but simply contributing to change is important. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a Canadian, and I started a political blog some time ago.  I decided it would be a good place to start exposing the clear lack of transparency in various places of government.  I also am a strong supporter of independents and small parties that do care about the rights of the citizens.  This is my current outlet, however I am always looking for more things I can do.  </p>

<p>My purpose of telling you this, is that you are an individual.  You have the power to affect change without asking permission. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t need anyone&#39;s approval to start affecting change.  Even if your solutions are unpopular, at least you are trying.  If you truly want freedom, start acting like you are. </p>

<p>As you haven&#39;t mentioned a single example.</p>

<p>Secondly, I told you this is my blog for my political opinions. Who exactly do you think I&#39;m shilling for anyway?</p>

<p>Not only have you gotten way off topic and decided to resort to baseless accusations, your attitude is frankly unnecessary.</p>

<p>If you are incapable of uncovering or revealing any true conspiracy than I will continue to out you yourself as the one who is baseless.</p>

<p>So you fault me for trying to understand by asking questions? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are incompetent at raising awareness and thus you are a distraction, a shill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While you may point at the privy council, there are other issues at play. For example, I pointed out on my blog how workers in Canada have to compete with 3rd world labour due to free trade agreements. </p>

<p>Different people have different focuses. My goal is to empower everyday average people. </p>

<p>I visit this sub to understand about conspiracy topics. I never claim to have all the answers. It&#39;s called Politcs, ideas &amp; People not &quot;deep candian conspiracies.&quot; </p>

<p>So instead of needlessly attacking me for being a shill when I&#39;m here to learn about the issues, you could actually explain what&#39;s so wrong with the privy council. </p>

<p>Instead you&#39;d rather argue with someone who commented in this thread to show people that they can make a difference. </p>
