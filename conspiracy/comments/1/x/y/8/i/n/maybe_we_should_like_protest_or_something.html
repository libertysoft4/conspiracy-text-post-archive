<p>Americans are not &#39;lazy&#39;, as in they do work, often for less than they are worth, to do shit jobs they do not want to do (not aligned with their first self) just like the rest of the world.

<p>That&#39;s not the type of lazy I&#39;m talking about.  Lazy in the sense that we&#39;re not standing up TOGETHER to <em>not</em> have to do those shit jobs; not willing to stand up together as one people against the obvious bad conditions and manipulation that exists.  <em>That&#39;s</em> what I&#39;m talking about; too lazy to come together and do SOMETHING about the fact that we slave for shit jobs while many of those who we slave for are getting thousands if not millions of times more money than we are.  Lazy in that sense.</p>

<p>The fact that people seem to be more interested in bashing on OWS and not understanding that they/we <em>were</em> indeed standing for and protesting against the inequality that exists means that we as a <del>shee</del>people <em>still</em> have very little hope of overcoming the manipulation that TPTB have over us.  We are apparently <em>very</em> easily led and manipulated.  The fact that so many decided to bash on the OWS movement instead of getting behind it and helping it out and making it better and <em>stronger</em> shows just how easily we are as a people to be lead astray, to be manipulated, to be divided, to be conquered.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Going inside is a great, great key.  I work on doing that as much as possible and have been doing so for a very long time.  And, be sure, we likely <em>will</em> fall like Rome and enter a techno-dark age.  Not living through that techno-dark age is not the point of going within.  The point of going within is to make sure that you don&#39;t get LOST in that darkness when we <em>do</em> fall like Rome...cuz there is no &quot;I hope we don&#39;t fall like Rome&quot; thinking anymore.  We&#39;re <em>falling</em>.  The shit <em>is happening</em>....just very slowly, but it&#39;s happening.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have no fucking clue and that comforts me. </p>

<p>I feel like I have at least <em>some</em> sort of a clue.  And the (great) extent toward which I don&#39;t and am lost? well, although I personally wouldn&#39;t say it &quot;comforts&quot; me...I at least try not to let it bother me too much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I cannot offer much in the way of advice. All I can do is talk about my own thoughts and values. Please be aware that I have begun phase one of halting participation in tribute. That is to say, I&#39;m no longer giving them money. Phase two is if and when they take notice and make demands of my money. If you do not know how to deal with them they&#39;re a bit of a thing. If you do know how to deal with them it&#39;s not so bad. They may break their own rules and force a conviction, however, you can ensure that they may only do so by violating due process in which case even if they cheat you set yourself up for a slam-dunk appeal. Which would mean that there&#39;s the outside chance of an interim of having them jack your shit. Which sucks. I&#39;m doing what I&#39;m doing knowing damned well that I&#39;m dealing with sub-criminal psychopaths.</p>

<p>If I were going to start a business I would not register with them. I would not obey their codes, laws, dictates and requests. I would simply conduct business and do the beast job I could. There are people who do such things. They control the courts and they have influence over banks and so you may not grow a large business in the normal sense. However, if you offer a good product at a reasonable price people will come regardless of whether or not you pay tribute. With some investments you could even hedge against the possibility that the psychopaths come and demand your shit. </p>

<p>Your question is a serious question and I don&#39;t think you know enough about the situation to defend against their attacks. I&#39;m only at the half-way point myself and I&#39;ve been looking into this for years. And even my stratagem has a risk since I&#39;m exposing myself to sub-criminal psychopaths. </p>

<p>Once you have skin in the game you&#39;re playing for real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This path is not for the feint of heart.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been putting out the feelers lately and I&#39;m amazed at how much shit I get from people. My personal favorite is when people tell me I can&#39;t use roads any longer. As though that has anything to do with the situation. I have spoken to two lawyers; one says I&#39;m technically correct, but that I should be careful. The other essentially said I&#39;m going to jail. Older people think I&#39;m the devil ad younger people think I&#39;m a stand up person. It&#39;s a strange situation to be in.</p>

<p>And I haven&#39;t even gotten to phase two when I start getting phone calls from the IRS.</p>

<p><em>That&#39;s</em> when it&#39;ll go from a dice game to Russian Roulette. </p>

<p>To see an example of what I&#39;ll be going through you can look at one of my conversations with someone in r/bicycling - I think I&#39;ve snagged the attention of a paralegal and they&#39;re giving me a bit of a run. Thus far they&#39;re asserting that laws apply because the laws apply. I hesitate to go into the question of the evidence that the codes apply because each case is specific. One wonders what the evidence really is that the codes apply to me (not that I&#39;ve found any such evidence) and so I wonder what they&#39;d come up with. Then again; fuck it. That&#39;ll be the next question I ask. No sense in beating around the bush. </p>

<p>As they say: tits or GTFO.</p>

<p>Yeah, be careful. Lawyers are infamous for their petty minds and inability to think outside of narrow constraints. You tell them that something is law and they&#39;ll prosecute you on it. Over a piece of paper! I have a fair idea of what I&#39;m getting myself into and I figure you go all in or you shut the fuck up. I can think of one conspiracy theorist with a talk show who certainly doesn&#39;t walk the walk. That said, I have friends with kids who are dubious and I don&#39;t blame them. The IRS are mean motherfuckers and they will fuck you up just because you inconvenienced them. This shit ain&#39;t tepid - it&#39;s hot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn, you are the man.  Message me if you ever need help with anything.  I said it last night already, but you reming me of henry david thoreau, and thats some of the highest praise I have.  Have you ever seen Zeitgeist?  A lot of that is bullshit, but there is a part towards the end where they interview a few ex-IRS agents, and they all say they dont pay income tax anymore, because there is literally no law anywhere authorizing it.  The only thing keeping people paying it is fear.  You think that would help your case?  Youve probably already looked, but check this page out</p>

<p>good shit here too</p>

<p>Stay strong.  They will try and break you using fear first, and physical force second.  Righteousness is on your side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just got a huge fucking slam dunk. A paralegal just bowed to me. They said that they&#39;re not going to argue with me any longer. As it turned out all I had to do was go into the normal infinite regress line of thinking. Holy shit. This is next door to defining pi. </p>

<p>Bro, I know a lawyer who may just take this bait. I was given shit by a lawyer earlier today and, because I like him, I didn&#39;t get into it. I let him claim that I was wring and let it go. I thin I may yet be on to something here.</p>

<p>Oh, and be careful of Zeitgeist. I saw it back in 2009 or something. Peter Joseph (the maker) has some clever insights, but he&#39;s very silly and shouldn&#39;t be taken too seriously. There is much bullshit within the conspiracy theory world. Ask questions and demand proof. If you don&#39;t have proof then you have nothing. Peter Joseph isn&#39;t a proofy kinda guy. Beware. There are ex-IRS agents who have taken a position similar to mine and have been prosecuted and placed in jail. I think I understand their mistakes and will not be joining them. </p>

<p>You never argue law. Never argue law. They will overturn and ignore anything you say. You can only ask questions and then make observations that relate to their responses to your questions. This means that you must know as well or better than they know what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>Since I just got a paralegal I think I&#39;m on the right track.</p>

<p>Learn as much as you can about as much as you can.</p>

<p>Magic is in the air tonight.</p>
