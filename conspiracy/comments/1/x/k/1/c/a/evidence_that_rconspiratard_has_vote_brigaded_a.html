The rest of this thread is just extra evidence like screenshots of the rank to prove nobody from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> will be voting in that dead thread. Obviously the posts have been jumbled a bit, so you&#39;ll have to do a bit of scrolling</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>I want to first mention that every comment I made was upvoted. Some were at plus 3, some plus 9, etc. Then conspiratard linked to it, and I only captured the screenshot when most of my comments were beginning to be negative. So the normal trajectory of my comments was on the positive side, then this thread slid far down the ranks (meaning nobody from conspiracy would be in there), and my comments suddenly became downvoted. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thread as it is right now: <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1xgv87/rconspiracy_huddle_everyone_get_in_here_we_need/">http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1xgv87/rconspiracy_huddle_everyone_get_in_here_we_need/</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s the brigade thread: <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1xj09u/rconspiracy_gather_their_greatest_minds_to_figure/">http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1xj09u/rconspiracy_gather_their_greatest_minds_to_figure/</a> </p>

<p>Here is a second brigade link, but it is in the comments of another post in r/conspiratard <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1xhfs4/apparently_we_dont_just_do_downvote_brigades_on/cfbnxwb">http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1xhfs4/apparently_we_dont_just_do_downvote_brigades_on/cfbnxwb</a> </p>

<p>As you can see, it was <a href="http://i.imgur.com/bivgB1l.png">number 1 in /r/conspiratard.</a></p>

<p>Here is a screenshot that says 19 hours ago- for time stamp purposes: <a href="http://postimg.org/image/efviif659/">http://postimg.org/image/efviif659/</a></p>

<p>Here is the rank on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> during the first screenshot (68): <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8usfQ8I.png">http://i.imgur.com/8usfQ8I.png</a> </p>

<p>So basically this thread will have barely any members from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> in it, but should be full of people from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> since it&#39;s currently number 1 in their sub.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/DlXKozE.png">Ranked at 86 in /r/conspiracy</a>, so this thread is dead, and we might have had a few downvotes from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>, but I&#39;m more concentrating on the comment voting. </p>

<p>As you can see, the only people commenting now are <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> members. That means any change in voting will be from them only. </p>

<p>I asked one of the commenters how they found the thread, they said they found it in r/conspiratard, clicked the link, then posted in that thread. You can also check how many of the people in there are conspiratard users. The thread is full of them. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1xgv87/rconspiracy_huddle_everyone_get_in_here_we_need/cfbybns">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1xgv87/rconspiracy_huddle_everyone_get_in_here_we_need/cfbybns</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think part of the problem with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, which was what the OP in the &quot;huddle&quot; thread was getting at, is that people won&#39;t monitor the new queue and simply vote up or down.  Everything ends up with this big mess of meta-content.</p>

<p>Another part, is that we feed every troll that comes along in the comments. Very seldom do I see a &quot;whatever dude&quot; response followed by silence.  We call them a shill and then respond to each one of their 20 responses.</p>

<p>I know this might be easily bypassed but let&#39;s not go that way; they don&#39;t care if they started first or we did it, they will always point out that we are the ones that brigade, even though they are the ones that are constantly xposting our own threads.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t make any claims about other <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> posters, but you have to note that A) none of the threads you linked to call for vote brigading and B) that <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> (tries) to only allow np.reddit.com links that at least discourages vote brigading.  As far as I know no one on <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> has ever legitimately called for a vote brigade.  At least I&#39;ve never seen someone say &quot;hey everyone go over here and upvote/downvote.&quot;  That&#39;s not the point of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>.  We actually love you guys &#39;cause you&#39;re beautiful just the way you are.</p>

<p>My comment is the top comment in the &quot;brigade&quot; thread, and you&#39;ll note that most people seem to agree with me.  It might be time to consider (just consider) that you get downvotes maybe because you&#39;re bad at internet, not because the scary people in <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> are out to get you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, and a few people from your sub were banned a couple weeks ago for participating in a vote brigade, and they all made a post claiming they didn&#39;t brigade. One was <a href="/u/duckvimes">/u/duckvimes</a> who now calls himself <a href="/u/duckvimes_">/u/duckvimes_</a></p>

<p>Hopefully that one get&#39;s banned as well, so we can all give a warm welcome to <a href="/u/duckvimes__">/u/duckvimes__</a></p>

The entire point of Conspiratard is to act better than others. It&#39;s childish bullshit. If you have to sit and discuss how others are stupid and how much better you are than them to feel good about yourself then you need to reexamine yourself as a person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, they get banned and then make new accounts. And lately, you guys have been posting a lot of direct links (not .np), which wouldn&#39;t really matter anyways as this post shows. Even if you use .np, your buddies over there still decide to replace it with www and vote. That&#39;s just pathetic. You guys really care that much about the votes in this sub?</p>

<p>Hi conspiratard :) </p>

<p>See, I can&#39;t vote right now because I clicked a link over there, then came here to respond. I&#39;m not going to be a pathetic troll and delete the np and replace with www so that my vote can count. </p>
