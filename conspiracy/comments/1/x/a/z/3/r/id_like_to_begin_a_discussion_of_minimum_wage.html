<p>Nowadays people are aghast if you suggest the people flipping their burgers, washing their car or stocking shelves at stores should be able to afford the basics of a home and food.</p>

<p>How did this come to exist?  How is it that the American people were slowly sold the idea that a wage earner should not by law earn enough to live?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct, the minimum wage is from an age gone by, it should be done away with.</p>

<p>I propose implementing a <em>living wage</em> (not to be confused with a <em>liveable wage</em>, which is <em>minimum wage</em> in disguise, that is, simply higher).  Each citizen receives, from the Crown, the needed amount of currency to live safely.  By doing so the evolutionary power of the free market can truly be unleashed.  Without moral or ethical quandary and with the assurance of another sunrise, Humanity can set foot firmly in the future, free of the befuddlement of the unfair. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply but I disagree with some of your points.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The solution they propose is not congruent with the outcomes they seek of &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;social justice&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the video explained this part well. A progressive redistribution of wealth must occur to pay for public services such as healthcare and education in order to ensure that everyone can access to these services. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>All mixed economies eventually lead to socialism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t understand how this would be the case unless you are suggesting that socialism is the natural will of the people, in which case I suppose I agree with you. However, different political parties with different agendas can always be elected. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thankfully the market can provide for people all the services government would, but more inefficiently and without the initiation of force.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is my opinion that the small use of force to redistribute wealth more evenly is outweighed by the benefits that arise such as better health, better education, and general happiness.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The government is force and coercion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand where you are coming from, but it is voluntary force and coercion imposed by a democratically elected government. Not perfect but redistribution is a good way to improve social mobility by providing everyone an equal start in life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s income doesn&#39;t rely on the productivity of it&#39;s service</p>
</blockquote>

<p>publicly run energy, telecommunication, farming and healthcare are more efficient than the messy system in place at the moment with state subsidies to private companies. There isn&#39;t any general reason a state company can&#39;t be run in a similar way to a private company when it comes to natural monopolies, it may actually be a better alternative as they can be run for the good of the people, democratically, and non profit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The basic gist is, government creates a problem in the economy, People protest about it, The government comes in and fixes it through force but in doing so creates another problem, which in turn needs to be fixed. The outcome is an enormous load of regulation, taxes, price controls, social programs, mass bureaucracy, staggering deficits and a national debt spiraling out of control. The exact state of the U.S today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reasons for what you are seeing in the US is a result of lobbyists and corporate greed. The government intervention is solely in the interest of big business and is a result of the corporations having far too much political power.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not a &quot;small use&quot;. To control the 300 million+ of citizens in the U.S, a mass police force, army and IRS have to be employed. It&#39;s not the quantity either. It&#39;s the moral principle of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I live in a small country of about 5 million people. Smaller countries are more efficient in governing themselves as they can be more flexible in their policies, they also tend to be more democratic. So I think the USA should devolve most of it&#39;s tax and spending powers to states. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, no. They all have the same agenda. It&#39;s promising other people&#39;s money to another group of society. They are just salesmen selling what they are going to spend money on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah I agree, we need a radical change in how we do democracy. A constitution that can only be amended by a public referendum that has a set of rules the government should abide by to make sure it is working in the interest for the majority of the people rather than corporations and special intrests.</p>

<p>I would also argue for the ability for the public to amend, propose and  repeal laws if enough people sign a petition calling for it. </p>

<p>I would replace the House of Lords with a randomly selected citizens assembly and localise power and decisions wherever possible.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s a horrible idea. Look at people today who are on welfare and refuse to go back to work.

    <div class="md"><p>everybody having the &#39;exact same amount of money&#39; is absolutely not what basic income is about at all. That sounds more like communism. basic income is about getting rid of welfare and minimum wage and a bunch of other government interference, while keeping your free market healthy by making sure there are always healthy consumers with the capacity to educate themselves and pay for basic goods. </p>

<p>And that advanced society, where machines are doing most of the work people used to, it&#39;s already here. Look out your window. The thing humans still work hardest at is dividing up money and looking busy. I think we had better start advancing our &#39;society&#39; soon or most of us will starve to death when those robots actually do take our jobs.</p>

<p>I do not think you can ask anyone to answer that affimitively, you&#39;d have to frame the question in a more pro-business manner.</p>

<p>If minimum wage increases there is a harder <strong>selection pressure</strong> on businesses, making those who are unfit for this new paradigm fall; the old makes way for the new if Minimum Wage increases and <em>it&#39;s bad for someones business</em> than that sucks for them, but it&#39;s great for the market cause if there was a demand for their product then someone else will step in to sell it for an affordable price. </p>

<p>The conspiracy to keep minimum wage down is from the largest corporations America has ever produced. These corporations are now the faces of America to the rest of the world. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/15/walmart-anti-union_n_4603253.html">Walmart doesn&#39;t let their employees unionize</a>, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2013/07/23/mcdonalds-minimum-wage-budget-ignores-tax-credits-food-stamps-and-reality/">Mcdonalds will tell you to work a second job</a> <strong>and these are two of the largest corporations that the US has ever known</strong>.</p>

<p>The conspiracy is clear, the companies themselves will resist an increase in minimum wage because it takes away from their profits. Because your federal law makers are in their pockets or subject to their whims from constituency-influences they don&#39;t have a choice about going against the corporate line when it comes to actually agitating for a change. </p>

<p>The best thing to do is hope your states can individually increase minimum wage, and their MWs are already diverse so your state is either struggling to break free of corporate influence and give the people some social mobility with financial legroom <strong>or</strong> trying to justify squeezing its own economy to a standstill so they can look better in comparison to their neighbours.</p>

<p>In Ontario Minimum wage is 10.25 in Canadian Tire money but in June 1st it becomes $11. </p>

<p>You have captured in a few paragraphs what I had hoped to generate as a result of this dialogue - a wider awareness of the conspiracy deep within the current situation of low wage earners in the United States.</p>

<p>The sick sad truth is that our elected officials have not worked for the voters for over a generation now.  People don&#39;t even remember when it used to be different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My favorite topic! I prefer to use a maximum wage... CEO - Officers - management cannot make more than ( pick a percentage) of their lowest paid worker. Profits are taxed after 30% to pay for  the unemployable masses that are out there. That would redistribute the wealth from the top and &quot;trickle&quot; it down a bit. Oh wait this isn&#39;t capitalism - sorry! </p>

<p>He&#39;s an ignorant fucktwad, but he says that. Just thought i&#39;d present you with a completely illogical counter-argument.</p>

<p>He thinks he&#39;s top-shit because he owns a business, but he&#39;s no better than his loser alcoholic friends. Maybe someday he&#39;ll turn off the t.v. and become aware of the world he lives in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Minimum wage is flawed. You cannot support a family on minimum wage, furthermore- people who otherwise could make some money are forced to work for nothing instead of 1-7 dollars an hour (think interns). </p>

<p>Small businesses, say someone with $2000 who can only afford to hire one person at $4 an hour are legally not allowed to exist to compete with the established businesses. Even if this would improve their situation.</p>

<p>Starting your own business now is prohibitively expensive. People cannot afford to make their own path due to laws. I can hire someone from overseas to work for me for $3/h but cannot hire someone who has been without a job in the US for the same amount. </p>

<p>That is how I feel about the minimum wage. If I were to ask you if there should be a law that bars people from working you would almost certainly think that was a bad idea.</p>

<p>The problem isn&#39;t the employers. As soon as people figure this out things will start to get better. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh.. people do it all the time. They clearly are able to afford the $4/h. A lot of jobs aren&#39;t worth $7 an hour. You just can&#39;t hire anyone in the US, so instead those jobs go to other countries instead of giving experience to those who live in the US.</p>

<p>If you are in favor of telling poor entrepreneurs trying to hire low skilled workers with the little money they have that they should be legally reprimanded, then that is on your conscience. I personally abhor the idea. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t worry our financial system is going to hit that crevice in the center of the road.  My evidence is the fact that our Government has to create a healthcare program for the nation (Great everyone has a chance at acquiring medical insurance).  When government has to step in and attempt to take the reins be it Obamacare, General Motors, Services they offer such as EBT, Medical, Social Security or anything else that presents the illusion of being a good thing we have to understand that the system is slowly cracking under the pressure.  </p>

<p>Minimum wage is just another fine example of a slowly failing system.  Lets raise minimum wage to $50.00/hr.  The amount of jobs would then decline even more.  We would have to continue the system of Quantitative Easing from the Fed forever.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m stuck in this situation with living check to check while funding my own education.  </p>
