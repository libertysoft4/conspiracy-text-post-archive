<p>While I am aware that PR firms as the like are willing to spend money to influence public opinion, I think we should require a high burden of proof to call someone a shill. (Although new accounts do look a little sketchy,) </p>

<p>The reason I think this is counter productive is because it may turn off people who are curious, but aren&#39;t &quot;down the rabbit hole&quot;. </p>

<p>I think we could help foster an awesome community that is welcoming to newcomers who may still hold some establishment views that haven&#39;t challenged them yet. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s never justified to call people shills, but I think it shouldn&#39;t be tolerated as a slur and it might turn away curious &quot;moderates&quot;. </p>

<p>In my mind this means we should respect well-meaning &quot;statists&quot; personally, while encouraging them to rethink certain ideas. </p>

<p>I honestly try and leave labels out of the conversation as best I can, but emotions can get in the way if it looks like someone is trying to piss me off, so I&#39;&#39;ll admit I sometimes lose myself, but as long as the conversation is kept mature, whether or not it looks like someone opposes my views, I just basically say fuck it if we can&#39;t come to an agreement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calling it a &quot;slur&#39; is a bit of a stretch. A <em>slur</em> implies a derogatory term of prejudice against a race or minority group. If someone makes pro-government arguments, it isn&#39;t completely unreasonable for another to make such an accusation, though I would personally prefer not to. That does not change the fact various governments (i.e. the United States and Israel, among others) do in indeed hire people to post pro-government propaganda on social media, reddit being no exception. I agree that it is somewhat absurd for one to assume that anyone who disagrees with them is a &quot;shill&quot; based on that criteria alone, even if that individual is so pro-government they defend NSA surveillance, for example. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and I support your or anyone&#39;s right to express your 1st amendment right however you see fit, whether you&#39;re a shill, statist, conspiracy theorist, or otherwise. </p>

<p>Now back to the question at hand.. I agree we should advise against making broad assumptions about others, in particular in the form of stereotypical accusations. Now should their be a rule against such conduct? I don&#39;t think that would be helpful, nor would I advise it, as it would infringe upon the accuser&#39;s rights as much or moreso as the accused. I believe it would be best to educate others here what a shill is, how they operate from time to time, and of the negative ramifications falsely accusing others can have, without overstepping our bounds in suppressing their speech or censoring anyone in the process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you have a point. Still, I believe the general usage of the word &quot;slur&quot; does not apply when using the word &quot;shill&quot;, though it may technically by definition. To say that those who are called a &quot;shill&quot; here are that offended or would feel oppressed by the usage of such a word is nonsense.</p>

<p>If you have the opinion we should call out more people who you suspect of being &quot;shills&quot; that&#39;s fine. I, on the other hand, feel it detracts from the conversation and makes the accuser appear ignorant, or worse, paranoid.</p>

<p>Again, I feel it would be better to simply educate others here from time to time on the facts regarding the usage of actual shills by various governments, their tactics, and how to deal with them properly, rather than simply making blanket assumptions about other users based on a disagreement here or in any other forum, to the extent of dismissing their entire argument or branding them something they may not in fact be based on such an assumption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright. Point taken. Regardless of the technical definition and application of the word slur, I stand by my point. I do not believe &quot;shill&quot; qualifies as a violation of Rule 1, nor do I believe its necessary to bar the usage of such terminology.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I still believe over-using the word shill, or accusing others of being a shill every time another user simply disagrees with another here is counterproductive, at best. At worst, it detracts from the existence of actual shills prevalent on social media, as is public policy to utilize them in the U.S. and Israel, among other nations. </p>

<p>Even though it&#39;s more of a law definition it kind of works the same. Calling someone a shill doesn&#39;t really promote anything in terms of an enlightened debate. Rather if someone brings you down to their level society deems both to be seen as idiots (not saying this is wrong or right). Rather than wasting time on the word shill it should really be just be a fact driven debate. </p>

<p>You could definitely say some in here have a bias though and that might think of someone as a shill, but bias doesn&#39;t always mean shill. Could just be how that person perceives something. I&#39;d never tell you that there aren&#39;t interest that are being fought for, but not everyone is a shill. </p>

It is impossible to tell on the internet if someone is receiving compensation for their commenting, but the ugly truth is that people are getting compensated for representing specific corporations and government online. Do I think everyone is a shill? Of course not, but I know they do exist. It is really up to an individual if they want to use the term or not. Besides, the term &quot;shill&quot; just has a nice ring to it and applies to all of the status-quo supporters easily. If someone is upset that they get called a name, they might want to check themselves before complaining. Being called a stupid name never hurt me before anyway. Man up people. </p>

<p>Dismissing ideas because they come from someone who &quot;sounds like a shill&quot; is shortsighted. Idea&#39;s should be criticized on their own merits regardless of who the speaker is. </p>

<p>The last thing I want to see is people using &quot;shill&quot; as a smear word to attack other people in the alternative media/truther/conspiracy world. I believe that we should be empowering people, not fighting fire with fire. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humans in general are idiots. If you come up with a trendy sounding name to call the government loyalists, it might change a bunch of minds. It&#39;s sad, but true. </p>

<p>The same goes for the opposite side. People are afraid to question authority because of the word &quot;conspiratard.&quot; By questioning authority, you increase your chances of being called this. &quot;You don&#39;t want to be a retard, do you little Jimmy?&quot;</p>

<p>Researchers don&#39;t usually call themselves truthers. You should be more selective with your words. </p>

<p>Then stop using the nickname &quot;truther&quot; in a disparaging manner, that&#39;s my point &quot;truster&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a whole lot of sympathy for those who function and operate in shill-like ways</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People love to go around calling everyone who disagrees with them a shill, when they have no idea whether they are really paid or not.  This sort of behavior does not hurt the person called a shill.  It hurts the person making the accusation, because it makes them look paranoid, and unable to realize that people out there can have an honest difference of opinion without being paid for it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As best as I can tell, &quot;shill-like ways&quot; means any opinion the speaker dislikes.  </p>

<p>I would encourage the extremists <strong>to keep calling people shills.</strong> It makes it easier to recognize who the extremists are who you can&#39;t reason with. </p>

<p>One slurs someone who is deserved of it.  The reaction of the slurred is how to tell if said slurred is a shill.  Point and case, our conversation.</p>
