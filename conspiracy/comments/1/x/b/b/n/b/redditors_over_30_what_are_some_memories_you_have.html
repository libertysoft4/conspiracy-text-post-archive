        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I remember the only time you saw police with masks and military weapons was when the news was covering another country. Our police and military were totally separate.</p>

<p>The news and invesigative journalism were real things, not just a party line or sound bites. When a story broke, a team of journalists would actually fact check multiple sources and do interviews and undercover work, rather than just accepting the govt/corporate press release as the absolute truth.</p>

<p>Travelling on a plane was fun, not a pre-arrest scenario. My dad would usually stow about 1/4 of weed in his guitar for personal use. He would ask security not to run it through the x-ray because it was a delicate,rare guitar. No one detained him, or handcuffed him they just said &quot;OK sir&quot;.</p>

<p>Police rarely killed someone, if they did it was usually a life threatening situation. I&#39;m not saying it was all roses, but they used a lot restraint with mace,guns and batons. </p>

<p>I think some of the apathy we have is because people have forgotten or don&#39;t know what they&#39;ve lost. Please add to this list if you can.</p>

<p>Back then in the U.S. a person could get on a plane with a paper ticket and walking through a metal detector and no one ever looked at your ID.  Hell, no one even cared if your name didn&#39;t match the ticket.  You could give it to someone else or sell it without restriction.There weren&#39;t any internal checkpoints in the U.S. either.  They didn&#39;t even have drunk driving checkpoints as that reminded people to much of authoritarian regimes.</p>

<p>Hello there, son.  I was born in the 1960s.  I&#39;m old enough to be your father.</p>

<p>You&#39;re quite mistaken about both the facts in your post, and the spirit of this post topic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flying was never enjoyable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Flying&#39;s enjoyability is subjective.  But it&#39;s not subjective that there is more invasive and time-consuming personal treatment for flyers in 2014 than there was in the 1970s when I grew up.  Which is what the OP&#39;s point was.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gas prices were already going up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gas prices have no objective charting-by-year to be found on the Internet.  Someone&#39;s keeping that off the search engines.  Gas prices plunged under Clinton.  There&#39;s little debate about that.  And it had more to do with OPEC than anybody.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The economy had just suffered a gigantic crash before 9/11.</p>

<p><em>Before 9/11</em>?  A &quot;gigantic crash&quot;?  Are you joking?</p>

<p>Incorrect.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television#History">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television#History</a></p>

<p>Police abuse statistics by year are not available on any search engine.  Possibly that&#39;s by design.  Therefore there is no objective answer to this question.  Police abuse has always been widespread in specific certain poor communities.  </p>

<p>Militarization &amp; lethal capacity of police, however, is entirely different today than it was in 1994.  It would be dishonest to claim otherwise.</p>

<p>This may be your most meritorious answer, although you should have  been able to cite statistics -- easily, including many famous historical examples -- to back your answer up.</p>

<p>The comment you replied to said that &quot;Prisons were state-run and not operated as a for profit business.&quot;</p>

<p>That is a fact.  From the mid-1800s (as early as 1820 in some places) through the late 20th Century, prisons were state-run and not operated as a for-profit business:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison#The_development_of_the_modern_prison">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison#The_development_of_the_modern_prison</a></p>

<p>Your example pre-dates state-run prisons, and much like slavery, lynching, Jim Crow, segregation, and other predatory social customs, privatized prisons were outlawed in favor social progress.  Popular support for state-run prisons arose in the widely-held popular belief that the role of prisons should be to <em>rehabilitate</em>, not to profit.</p>

<p>Whether or not prisons should be used for profit or social good is up for debate.  </p>

<p>Whether or not early U.S. privatized prisons were <em>replaced with state-run prisons</em> is not debatable.  </p>

<p>The statement &quot;Prisons were state-run and not operated as a for-profit business&quot; is a fact, and to state that privatized prisons once existed, technically, <em>bears no relevance to the thread topic</em> &quot;What <strong>memories from your youth</strong> have drastically changed?&quot; and simply gives the appearance that you are trolling.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t even know what storage methods they used, and actually, it&#39;s not that hard to keep data stored for a long enough time and then get rid of it.</p>

<p>This is what old security systems do, they run on a loop of whatever duration, really important to secure facilities usually run their tapes on at least a 24 hour loop.</p>

<p>You also have the option to set the frame rate, or how many pictures per minute the camera takes so you can fine adjust your record loop for storage concerns so you can record more with less detail ( motion between the frames ) or record less but with more detail ( full motion video ).</p>

I used to view us as a special nation but now a lot of that feels like a bit of a sham. Yes, before you say it I am going back to my apartment after work today, going to happy hour with my girlfriend and live a very happy existence. I am not unaware of that fact.

    <div class="md"><p>We were terrified that 1984 could actually happen. We were willing to fight against it.</p>

<p>Now that it has started to happen it&#39;s only mildly surprising that nobody really cares.</p>

<p>In the book there was no exchange for the loss of privacy and freedom of speech. Thankfully the reality is that we are gladly willing to trade our privacy and freedom of speech for smart phones, video games, and cheap unhealthy food.</p>

<p>The book was intended for an adult audience. Orwell didn&#39;t realize that when his nightmare came into fruition there wouldn&#39;t be many adults left.</p>

<p>This past Superbowl was the most watched television event in American history. Getting excited about grown men playing with a ball for points is way more important to us now than caring whether or not anyone is putting cameras in our homes to watch our every move.</p>

No worries about being put on a no fly list. Then you have to think about all of the rights we lost, but haven&#39;t really affected most people on a large scale yet. The government could simply drive up to your house and legally abduct you without charge or trial. So much of your life is recorded.

    <div class="md"><p>For the very old who still remember ... <em>before Reagan</em></p>

<p>Not all of these relate directly to freedom, but these are factoids which show how much the U.S. has changed since the 1970s:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Gas stations were full-service, and they used to advertise free giveaway items like dinner plates &amp; <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Nice-Vintage-NFL-Mobil-Oil-Chicago-Bears-Tall-Drinking-Glass-/400632992111">drinking glasses</a> ... to entice people to come buy gasoline.</p></li>
<li><p>There were local &quot;price wars&quot; between gas stations to compete for customers.</p></li>
<li><p>Until Jimmy Carter de-regulated airlines &amp; made them <em>more capitalist</em> (because of what a communist asshole he was), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_deregulation"><em>airlines were not allowed to have different prices to the same destination</em></a>.  Airlines were forced to compete only on services &amp; perks (<em>&quot;We have lobster&quot; ... &quot;But we have pillows&quot;</em>). </p></li>
<li><p>All air flights <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflight_smoking">had a <em>SMOKING</em> section and a <em>Non-Smoking section</em></a> which was utterly asinine, because you could smell the smoke in the non-smoking section.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_advertising_in_the_United_States#Advertising_boom">Doctors &amp; lawyers were <em>not</em> allowed to advertise</a>.  Because certain professions were considered to be <em>above commerce</em> and were considered &quot;sacred avocations&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Until the late 1980s, outside of NYC, there was very little right-wing radio, and none of it was anger-radio as it exists today.</p></li>
<li><p>Nobody was squealing to privatize the post office, privatize roads, privatize national parks, <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/03/08/954169/-Michigan-Governor-Seeks-Emergency-Powers">privatize public assets and sell them off to corporate cronies for pennies on the dollar in the name of &quot;reducing debt&quot;</a></p></li>
<li><p>Let&#39;s not be too nostalgic:  JFK was assassinated in broad-daylight by a &quot;magic bullet&quot;; the press helped to cover it up; the Zapruder film was hidden from the public for a decade; Operation Mockingbird was and still is entirely successful in creating a &quot;mainstream media&quot; that keeps the real questions off the airwaves; CIA cocaine was buried even when a reporter named Gary Webb documented it; Iran-Contra was kept low-key while Clinton&#39;s blowjobs were taken seriously as the biggest scandal since Watergate, forget Iran-Contra or BCCI.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, the media (due to the public&#39;s lack of terror) did not hype <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_Hanafi_Siege"><strong>Muslims seizing a building &amp; taking hostages &amp; killing in downtown Washington D.C.</strong></a>, nor did the media report much on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Letelier#Assassination">car-bomb in Washington D.C.</a>.  Nor did the media make a big deal of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Underground#Pentagon_bombing">a bomb in the Pentagon bathroom</a>.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Did you know <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1971/3/2/bomb-explodes-in-capitol-blast-linked/">the Senate was bombed in 1971</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_United_States_Senate_bombing">again in 1983</a>?</strong> </p>

<p>Imagine what would happen today if the Senate was bombed ... or if Muslims took over a building and held hostages and killed a cop in D.C.?</p>

<li>Also, when opinions were broadcast on television stations (which were still considered &quot;public airwaves&quot; even though licensing was auctioned), any opinion was required to have an &quot;equal-time&quot; opposing opinion, if anyone had one.</li>
</ul>

<p>This was called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_Doctrine">&quot;The Fairness Doctrine&quot;</a>, which was not law, but FCC policy to give opposing viewpoints equal broadcast time.</p>

<p>Right-wingers now hate and decry this, but they benefitted when the Democratic Party controlled most branches of government (or all branches of government).</p>

<p>Television in the 1970s required &quot;public affairs broadcasting&quot; (usually at late or early hours when most people weren&#39;t watching) and citizens were allowed to give speeches (like public-access cable).</p>

<p>This was eliminated under Reagan.</p>

<p>There are no examples of any of these &quot;citizen speeches&quot; on YouTube.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my teens, there were no cell phones, no computers, no video games, and no cable television. We had two channels and they both signed off around midnight. If you wanted entertainment after that, you read a book or listened to late-night talk shows on the radio. In university we wrote our reports out in longhand, or if we were fancy, we typed them on a typewriter.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t need a helmet to ride a motorcycle, and to get a motorcycle license all you had to do was ride up and down the block once. Cars had no seatbelts, and no headrests, which means that when you wanted to back up all you needed to do was put your arm across the back of the front seat and turn your head. No restrictions on movement. And cars were big! You could put a couple of full-sized bicycles in the trunk and close the lid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, you are correct. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_(song)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_(song)</a> the unedited video showed him putting the gun in his mouth. However, the way the edited video was cut made many people (including myself) believe that he had killed his classmates. Also, the lyrics about his drawing with &quot;arms raised in a V, the dead lay in pools of maroon below&quot; was another reason I thought this. Thanks, I&#39;m a huge fan of the 90&#39;s Seattle scene, yet I never knew this.</p>

<p>They were 18 and okay, I&#39;m 24 but I can say yeah you don&#39;t magically get any smarter at adulthood but taking responsibility for your actions (uploading it for all to see) is also a part of adulthood.

    <div class="md"><p>28 about to be 29. I hope that counts.</p>

<p>Smoking indoors. The mall, theatres. I dont even smoke anymore, I think part of the reason why is because they stopped letting us smoke at leisure. I still have no issue with people smoking though, fuck, its their choice, and its my choice to go places where I know people smoke.</p>

<p>Fights. This may have been only my school, but we were allowed to fight. Not on school (unless it was in a tech class, they would take us into the welding room and let us go at it) But after school, at the park, whatever. It was not a criminal offense to fight back then. No one called the cops. You fought, you either won, or you got beat up. If you got beat up, you didn&#39;t call the cops, you just lost a fight. My youngest brother was 4 years younger than me. Apparently, now, same school if you get in a fight, outside of school, even over summer vacation you were reprimanded for it in school. </p>

<p>Cops. Security clearance at school. Pre 9/11 we were allowed to leave as Juniors and Seniors at my school during lunch break. Kids would eat outside no matter which grade. No hall monitors. Post 9/11, maybe two weeks afterwards. 8 full time hall monitors, walkie talkies, clipboards. Metal detectors at the doors. Dogs started sweeping the halls randomly twice a week searching for drugs. They even had parking lot security patrolling the lots.</p>

<p>Cellphones came in around my Junior year, but nobody wanted to have them. It was generally so kids could call their parents for rides for things, checking in etc. Along with cell phones, no one would text, I remember texting my friend during class when I first noticed the mms section of the phone and didn&#39;t know what it was. He asked me to never do it again.</p>

<p>Outside of that, the t.v. shows to me seem to be hugely different. I am sure you&#39;ve heard the bitching. History channel was basically documentaries, that were fucking awesome. Learning channel had dinosaurs and shit. Animal planet was a bunch of steve irwin and really old docs on single animals. But the biggest difference would be commercials and how they broad casted products. The frothy emotional appeal, I believe it started with the Just do it campaign (which was much before my time) But it picked up steam quickly. All of the sudden commercials stopped being about showing what the product was, instead they started showing you a way you can feel if you only had this product. However, that frothy emotional appeal is in all of our media now and its gotten so dumbed down its ridiculous. They dont even attempt to act out scenes anymore, they just cue the music, slow the scene down and thats it. Its awful.</p>

<p>*Ninja edit: I&#39;d also like to add. Stopping by was a thing. You could stop by someones house, and people would stop by your house. Out of the blue a random friend or family would just show up, you would invite them to eat dinner, watch t.v., or join you with what you are doing.</p>

<p>And, dating, or friends in general. Getting out of your vehicle, shaking the hand of the parents of the girl you are taking out on a date. Picking a friend up to do something, getting out of your car, knocking on the door and speaking with your friends parent/family member asking for said friend.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Disappearing Middle</p>

<p>When I was a teenager growing up on Long Island, one of my favorite excursions was a trip to see the great Gilded Age mansions of the North Shore. Those mansions weren&#39;t just pieces of architectural history. They were monuments to a bygone social era, one in which the rich could afford the armies of servants needed to maintain a house the size of a European palace. By the time I saw them, of course, that era was long past. Almost none of the Long Island mansions were still private residences. Those that hadn&#39;t been turned into museums were occupied by nursing homes or private schools.</p>

<p><strong>For the America I grew up in -- the America of the 1950&#39;s and 1960&#39;s -- was a middle-class society, both in reality and in feel.</strong>  The vast income and wealth inequalities of the Gilded Age had disappeared. Yes, of course, there was the poverty of the underclass -- but the conventional wisdom of the time viewed that as a social rather than an economic problem. Yes, of course, some wealthy businessmen and heirs to large fortunes lived far better than the average American.  But they weren&#39;t rich the way the robber barons who built the mansions had been rich, and there weren&#39;t that many of them. The days when plutocrats were a force to be reckoned with in American society, economically or politically, seemed long past.</p>

<p>Daily experience confirmed the sense of a fairly equal society. The economic disparities you were conscious of were quite muted. <strong>Highly educated professionals -- middle managers, college teachers, even lawyers -- often claimed that they earned less than unionized blue-collar workers.</strong>  Those considered very well-off lived in split-levels, had a housecleaner come in once a week and took summer vacations in Europe.  But they sent their kids to public schools and drove themselves to work, just like everyone else.</p>

<p>But that was long ago. The middle-class America of my youth was another country.</p>

<p>We are now living in a new Gilded Age, as extravagant as the original.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Growing up in the 80&#39;s, i remember going on picnics with my uncle to the cotton fields across the street from the landing strip at Luke AFB in Phoenix, AZ(Litchfield, actually). We would spend Saturday afternoons watching fighter jets going on training flights all afternoon, not ever encountering any resistance. We were separated from the base only by a chain linked fence, so had the perfect vantage point. </p>

<p>Recently, i tried to do this with my sons. Within 10 minutes of us parking, we were approached by armed MPs, advising us that we weren&#39;t allowed to be there, and that we could face legal trouble if we didn&#39;t leave immediately. They were polite, but firm, even after i explained our intentions. It was a sad realization that i couldn&#39;t share what i considered a wonderful experience with my sons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what social conditioning is all about. The elite doesn&#39;t care about we old people (by old, I mean, older than 30). It has control of the schools and what is taught there, and it is brainwashing children to accept its mantra of a police state for their own protection. Look at those two young white men who were beaten by the gang of black midgets in Texas. They didn&#39;t even <em>try</em> to fight back. It never even <em>occured</em> to them to take any action to defend themselves. That&#39;s what the elite want to turn every white person into, and they are well on their way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the biggest thing that I think changed is our throwing away the old saying &quot;sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.&quot;  </p>

<p>I like to call it the shit factor.  You and your buddies got called and called each other the worst names we could think of.  IT didn&#39;t matter, it was only words.  Back then it was your actions that counted.  If you got bagged on back then you would just be like &quot;yea, that&#39;s a good one&quot; now you complain to the thought police.
  Now it&#39;s just racist or you&#39;re called out for sensitivity training because someone is offended, or even worse, someone is offended for another group that they themselves are not a member.  In todays society we have become so prickly that we can even fuck around and make a good, funny joke without being labeled a racist homophobia who is only a hater.  It&#39;s really out of control.  So much so that today, its the words that hurt everyone and the original rhyme is now a fossil or unheard of and certainly not practiced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m 47. During the 90s, I had a job where I flew a lot. You could get to the airport with 30 minutes to spare and make your flight. I took the occasional red-eye and they were so empty everyone got a row to themselves, and you were given a blanket and a pillow and encouraged to stretch out across all three seats and sleep the whole time. Two years ago I took a red-eye and it was wall-to-wall people. It was extremely rare to have a &quot;very full flight&quot;; now they say that every single time I board. You got a meal for every flight -- which is actually kind of weird to even think about now, because all anyone ever did was complain about airplane food. It&#39;s weird to me that that used to be part of the process, filling out the kind of meal you wanted.</p>

<p>In 1988, I flew to Germany and remember being shocked at the security when we arrived (they had rifles, too). Same trip, flew back with a box at my feet full of wine bottles.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t feel as overwhelmed by continuous bad news, and I think that&#39;s more due to the endless availability of every news source worldwide than it would be to my youthful energy back in the day. In the early 2000s when political blogs took off, I gorged myself on politics every day. Recently I&#39;ve cut back a lot on my reading of it because you start to feel like there&#39;s nothing good going on in the world.</p>

<p>We could plead innocent to things back then -- how could we have known? No one knew what was happening! -- when news of a genocide trickled in. Now we have Google Earth showing us concentration camps in North Korea and we are all doing nothing. It&#39;s depressing. </p>

Nobody had cell phones and there were no surveillance cameras.  If you weren&#39;t near a phone you could not communicate with people.  If you heard something on the radio you liked but they didn&#39;t say who did it you may never find it unless it was popular enough to play again.  If you wanted to hear music you had to hunt it down in a record store and you had to buy a single or the album to hear it.  If you wanted to watch a movie you had to go to a movie theater.  Later you had to buy or a rent a VHS player and rent the movie you wanted to see.  There was a lot more empty space where nature just existed without development.  There were far less police and they had far less gear.  They also tended to be more mellow, part of the community and not like military like they are now, machine-like.  If you were gay or anything anyone found different you were far likelier to be assaulted.  You rode bikes, played with other kids. There were no video games, computers, or internet.  If you wanted to learn about something you had to buy books or go to the library and you were limited by whatever happened to be in your town, just like the music.  If you wanted something else you might find a catalog and order from far away with a check you may or may not ever get it but if you did it would be months away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s important to understand these changes in our personal lives and our communities as part of a much larger sociopolitical and economic trend, which consists of a rise of the financial elite and the postwar expansion of rightwing extremism in the US. </p>

<p>The gradual spread of paranoia, absolutism, and authoritarianism (and most recently rabid nationalism) has largely come from the growth of the MIC/PIC/Intelligence/LEO/security trusts. Which as we know developed rapidly post Second World War and expanded even further after the Vietnam War to strengthen government powers and crush dissenting voices, and even more so after 9/11 in order to further cement and condition public tolerance and support for the dominance of the police state, the MIC, and an incalculably wasteful Interventionist foreign policy. </p>

<p>The economic development of the US has been deliberately stunted in order to justify theft by corporations and government, to create fear, keep the population exhausted, drugged up, and over worked, and to boost enlistment and support for the MIC, and to encourage escapism, among many other things.</p>

<p>The constant, relentless fearmongering against everyone and everything, (which is largely a product of the Cold War of which the War on Terror is merely an extension of) has been the most effective tool used by the elite to justify the consolidation of wealth, expansion of extremism, authoritarianism, Interventionist foreign policy, and government/corporate oppression. </p>

<p>As a manufactured reaction to this, a new counter culture has arisen of the escapist consumer that seeks to avoid involvement in politics and to spend what little free time and lifespan they have left self-gratifying in blissful ignorance. This behavior is extremely pronounced in Millenials as many parents sought to shelter and coddle their children in the post 9/11 world. </p>

<p>As for myself, I remember when gas was 95 cents in 2000. You could go anywhere and get a decent paying job with little to no education or skill set to start. The police in my area of the country would be more likely to actually help people rather than harass/assault them. The cost of living was more affordable. People could travel about more freely without worrying of being questioned or detained. Air travel was far more enjoyable and affordable. Employers actually offered benefits. Concern for child welfare wasn&#39;t extreme and overprotective. People by and large were more helpful, open, and trusting of each other. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to play &quot;Devil&#39;s Advocate&quot; here...</p>

<p>I am 37.</p>

<p>When I was a kid it was at the height of the Bloods / Crips / Crack epidemic and we were not allowed to play outside after dark and my parents kept some serious tabs on us.  So, the &quot;We could play outside!&quot; thing might be true in certain places, but it did exist &quot;back in the good ole days&quot; as well.</p>

<p>Before I was born, J. Edgar Hoover did have a lot of initiatives out there (Cointelpro, etc.) that did pretty much have a lot of police and federal agents kill and silence, etc. a lot of people.  That&#39;s not new.  I guess it&#39;s just more &quot;accepted.&quot; </p>

<p>We did not have even a remote understanding of HIV/AIDS when it hit the news.  When Rock Hudson and Freddie Mercury died, it freaked out everyone, and a LOT of people had, what most people would consider today, the most ridiculous paranoia about the disease.  I do realize that this was ignorance / lack of information because science did not know either, but again...  the world was not &quot;magically&quot; rosy back in the late 80&#39;s / early 90&#39;s.</p>

<p>Yes, you could go to the gate to meet people at the airport.  You still would get arrested if you joked about bombs.  There were terrorist hijackings.  </p>

<p>When I was a very young kid (Elementary School) the government portrayed and many people felt about the USSR close to how the government portrays and how people feel about Middle Eastern &quot;Terrorists.&quot;  In fact, in WWF (Now WWE) Wrestling, 2 of the most infamous &quot;Villains&quot; were Nikolai Volkov and The Iron Shiek.  (USSR &amp; Iran)  (TOTAL side note, The Iron Shiek&#39;s Twitter feed is hysterical)  The USSR and the USA were HUGE rivals at everything - this was a big deal in the 1980 and 1984 Olympics.</p>

<p>The news was not as &quot;Cable TV&quot; heavy as it is now, but Wolf Blitzer was indeed on CNN.  &quot;If it bleeds, it leads,&quot; was pretty much still like it is today... especially in terms of gang and drug violence.</p>

<p>Iran contra hearings.</p>

<p>A lot of the posts here are very interesting and true.  I do remember them.  However, there have always been propaganda agendas and things &quot;to be terrified of.&quot;</p>

<p>one personal tale:i started grad school in manhattan in &#39;98. pre 9/11 you could walk into any college/university in nyc by showing your ID and use their library (finding esoteric journals at that time was a bitch). post 9/11 you needed paper work, had to make phone calls, etc. etc. at the time it was crazy frustrating, but looking back it&#39;s just one more injustice in an avalanche of lost freedoms...</p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe how jaded and unbelieving I&#39;ve become.  It&#39;s not just due to government propaganda either, since as many lies are told by anti-government provocateurs as by the government themselves, so I just don&#39;t know what to believe any more.  I hear a story and chase that for a while believing, or wanting to believe.  Then someone debunks that story, then the debunker gets debunked...ad nauseum...</p>
