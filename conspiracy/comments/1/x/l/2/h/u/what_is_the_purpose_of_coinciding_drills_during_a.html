    <div class="md"><p>If you use compartmentalization during planning it allows you to use innocents to help execute the attack. They may never know if their actions were the real attack. For example you can get a role player to set explosives somewhere believing them to be fake. You could get a radar operator to put fake planes in the sky you could have police and other first responders pre staged while you&#39;re at it for the media</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my speculation is that all vetted personnel or leadership are in the right place at the right time to establish as much control on the ground as possible, and prevent local and regional first responders and media from screwing the whole thing up. control access to the scene, control data to media, and control the narrative. compartmentalized knowledge for vetted folks, blackmail or rewards for troublemakers, and others just following orders or doing their jobs unawares. this mixture of players in the know and those just doing their jobs would help to ensure a sense of authenticity during and after the drama. amazing how all the proper first responders and swat teams are all suited up, comms blazing and ready to rock when the drill &quot;goes live.&quot; </p>

<p>but it&#39;s probably just a coinkeedink, right? </p>

<p>one coincidence, after another, after another, after another. </p>

<p>why do I think it is possible for agents within state intelligence to choreograph a controlled terror situation? because Operation Gladio I (and the very likely Gladio II: Arab Reboot) is just one example that demonstrates that such activity is a historically factual method of covert state coercion, and that powerful networks of players coordinating to create Terror Theater can operate successfully completely outside of public awareness. Parts of Gladio were only discovered after Vincent Vinciguerra was fingered by Judge Casson and confessed. His testimony reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With the massacre of Peteano, and with all those that have followed, the knowledge should by now be clear that there existed a real live structure, occult and hidden, with the capacity of giving a strategic direction to the outrages...[it] lies within the state itself...There exists in Italy a secret force parallel to the armed forces, composed of civilians and military men, in an anti-Soviet capacity that is, to organise a resistance on Italian soil against a Russian army...A secret organisation, a super-organisation with a network of communications, arms and explosives, and men trained to use them...A super-organisation which, lacking a Soviet military invasion which might not happen, took up the task, on Nato&#39;s behalf, of preventing a slip to the left in the political balance of the country. This they did, with the assistance of the official secret services and the political and military forces.[4]</p>

<p><strong>&#39;You had to attack civilians, the people, women, children, innocent people, unknown people far removed from any political game. The reason was quite simple: to force ... the public to turn to the state to ask for greater security.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oJm2jg7lJA">video excerpt of Vinciguerra</a></p>

<p>Subsequent investigations revealed a vast international covert operation operating with orders from the CIA, and support from NATO and MI6. This was discovered in 1984, but had been operating for decades. </p>

<p>By comparison, and after decades of experience, staging repeated small operations at schools and movie theaters in an escalating strategy of tension and PR campaigning must be relatively small potatoes.</p>

<p>Absolutely 100% spot on.</p>

<p>This was clearly the modus operandi for both Sandy Hook (where genuine medical first-responders were prevented from entering the school!) and the Boston Bombings, though the latter also included large numbers of actors to play bomb victims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the example of 911, it caused so much confusion that NORAD didn&#39;t realise that the exact training situation they were role playing, and the reports that they were recieving were actually real reports of real planes being highjacked so it took much much longer to respond, and when they tried to respond NORAD couldn&#39;t because as part of the drill as a safety precaution only the president, vice president could authorise launching of a figher plane to intercept the highjacked planes. </p>

<p>During the boston marathon for example if a government agent was caught with a bomb by a honest cop then they could say it was just this drill they were doing.</p>

<p>During the Sandy hook shooting, even the media was so &quot;confused&quot; they filmed and broadcast aerial shots of the school having the drill, not the actual school where the shooting took place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing I gathered from all my readings on 9/11 is that the fact that a drill was going on added a ton of confusion. First it delayed initial responses as everyone had to confirm if things were real world or simulation. Then they had to contend with the idea that any blip on the radar or odd data point could just be part of the exercise.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the fact that a lot of the resources that would be used in responding to the attack are busy doing other things and not ready for a real world situation. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the idea that by having the exercise on that day you can have a lot of radio chatter confusing things and allowing you to use channels that may be open for the purpose of training.</p>
