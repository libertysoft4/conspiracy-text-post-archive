I&#39;m interested in why some of you may or may not believe the moon landings happened, and what key factor(s) and evidence drive that belief.  I&#39;ve heard and read a lot of different things, especially involving the photos and movies, but what else?  I&#39;m especially interested in hearing from other space/satellite/astronomy/physics professionals, if there are any reading this.  Thanks in advance for your responses!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you seen the mythbusters shoot lasers at the moon and receieve the signal back from the retroreflectors?</p>

<p>Sure, this could be faked but you can go and do it yourself if you have the tools. Or you can go to a place that has the tools and observe what is happening. They showed how they do it on the show.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what solidified it in my mind as a non-issue. Independant verification. I believe Japan has verified it as well as google with sattelite pictures of the moon.
Of course all of these things could be faked but the more evidence that is out there the harder it is to believe it was faked.</p>

<li>It was on television. 2. It&#39;s ($)25 billion dollars cheaper to not go to the moon and fail. Though, even if they did try (I&#39;m sure they did), even failure would result in a videos success. The government didn&#39;t fund a moon expedition for &quot;mankind&quot; -- right, propaganda is king. As well as religious organizations.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s quite expensive and dangerous and there isn&#39;t all that much that we can do on the moon that we can&#39;t do while orbiting the Earth.</p>

<p>What reason can you think of for returning? For the incredible cost it takes to get out of earth&#39;s orbit there has to be a reason and if you can do the same stuff in orbit then why not?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a good point.  My response would be: what about the Soviets?  To this day they haven&#39;t put a man on the moon despite the fact that they were kicking our <em>ass</em> in the years prior to us reaching the moon.  Did they just give up?  I don&#39;t know, there are definitely a lot of unanswered questions surrounding the whole thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read it... i think it&#39;s pretty good for a high level analysis but I was hoping for more specifics. I will say though that it&#39;s convinced (or maybe reminded me) to keep an open mind about any topic.</p>

<p>I think a lot of his arguments could go either way, especially the ones about not having gone that far into space again. He makes the mistake a few times of suggesting that since we haven&#39;t gone out that far again we can&#39;t. I think it&#39;s more likely that we have no reason to and the cost vs the payback is small.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn, just spent 3 straight hours reading... Like most of these issues I don&#39;t know what to think lol.</p>

<p>Some of his claims I felt were easy to disprove (I spent a good while analyzing the photo with identical backgrounds and feel there is a fairly obvious explanation for how that photo works) but I thought a good number of points he made were quite compelling.</p>

<p>One thing I&#39;m sure of is that there was definitely some dishonesty going on back then. A few of those launches that took place immediately after the Russians hit a milestone were sketchy, especially when it took them another year or two to repeat the feat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I think in the end what I took away from it was that something definitely went on besides what we the public were told. Whether the entire thing was faked for some reason or various lies were peppered in for some reason I don&#39;t know. Too many unanswered questions to just shut the book entirely though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started to read that link, and there were several things that were just blatantly wrong. Like the rocket thing, he writes as if the rockets would have to be firing the whole way to the moon and back. That is simply absurd. One the space craft is in outer space, momentum will carry them the rest of the way, that is so simple, anyone should be able to understand it, there is no friction to slow the space craft down, so it would continue on its journey indefinitely, until it was caught by another celestial body&#39;s gravity or crashes into it. Comets do this very thing around the sun constantly. It&#39;s really not that mysterious. So, to say that this vehicle traveled this many more miles than this other one with the same amount of fuel really holds no water. Once that ship is in space, it will continue on in whatever direction it is heading indefinitely, like I explained earlier. Starting from flawed logic will reveal flawed results. </p>

<p>There was one other thing in the article that just was so blatantly wrong. Quoting &quot;Again, the question that immediately comes to mind is: Why? Why has no nation ever duplicated, or even attempted to duplicate, this miraculous feat? Why has no other nation even sent a manned spacecraft to orbit the Moon? Why has no other nation ever attempted to send a manned spacecraft anywhere beyond low-Earth orbit?&quot;</p>

<p>The miraculous feat was repeated several times. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Correct me if I&#39;m wrong but doesn&#39;t the Moon orbit the Earth?  As in, it&#39;s stuck in Earth&#39;s gravitational field?  So how do you suppose that a space shuttle could just &quot;glide&quot; to the Moon based on momentum?  If anything the opposite would be true - you could &quot;fall&quot; back to the Earth when leaving the Moon from the Earth&#39;s gravity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The miraculous feat was repeated several times.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Russia just decided to completely abandon their entire space program the instant we beat them to the Moon and have not once since made the attempt in 40 years despite the fact that they were obliterating us in every aspect of space travel before then?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, the Russians really did try to make it to the moon, even while the Americans were succeeding.  The argument that the Russians just never tried would certainly be compelling, but it isn&#39;t actually true.  Due to various problems with their moon program, Russia scrapped their program due to launch failures and, perhaps more importantly, budget cuts.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-1_rocket#Moon_missions">Here</a>&#39;s a link to the Russian N-1, the counterpart to the Saturn V, which took Americans to the moon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. They didn&#39;t go because they weren&#39;t able to despite dominating the USA in every aspect of space travel before then. My point was that it throws the official story of the moon landing in question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, how many times should we have gone back to satisfy you?  Is it conceivable that NASA wanted to move onto other things (like sending robots to Mars like we&#39;re currently doing)?  Why should they keep going back to the moon over and over again?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m not expert on Russia, so I don&#39;t really know, but it could be something to do with not wanting to waste money when they had lost the space race.  </p>

<p>Perhaps there is some other explanation.  </p>

<p>What does what Russia did have to do with whether America landed on the moon 6 times?</p>
