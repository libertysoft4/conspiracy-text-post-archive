<p>Except nobody would have known something like the Atomic Bomb could even be possible by the time America joined the war, however. The way you worded that suggests using Atomic Bombs was the primary objective all along... </p>

<p>Furthermore, nobody asked permission to use the A-Bomb. The American people being ok with it or not didn&#39;t matter, so it&#39;s a moot point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, none of us can say for sure that dropping those bombs weren&#39;t the intention all along, and given the past few decades, it really wouldn&#39;t surprise me if it was.  </p>

<p>But my point was that if Americans were truly against it there would have been [more] outrage after-the-fact that could have even altered future war history (could have, although I admit it&#39;s a stretch).  The gov&#39;t got the support they wanted, dropped the bombs, and never had to deal with any post-bombing consequences.</p>

<p>and I am disagreeing with you.  If the government in 1941 had said  &quot;holy shit guys, look at what these goddamn crazies were going to do! WE&#39;RE UNDER ATTACK AND NEED TO ACT NOW.&quot;  It would have netted the same effect as the 93&#39; bombing IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But you <em>are</em> comparing those two things... </p>

<p>Is really not the same being under attack by a terrorist organization that <strong>might</strong> have ties to a certain country than being under attack by the military of said country. </p>

<p>Not a lot of people would be ok with going to war with Mexico if some members of a cartel killed 10 people, but I really doubt someone would complain about the same war if Mexican <em>troops</em> tried to attack, say, Laredo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve already read it. </p>

<p>That&#39;s an argument in favor of the United States needing a reason to attack Japan, heck, it may even be an argument in favor of the United States government not taking actions to avoid Pearl Harbor. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s not what we&#39;re discussing, nor what the OP suggested. The discussions is whether or not it would have been sufficient cause for war to curtail the attack on Pearl Harbor before the attack took place. </p>

<p>I agree that it would have been sufficient. </p>

<p>Then, if it was planned, it was terrible plan, because the loss of machinery and personnel was unnecessary.</p>

<p>Thus, maybe it wasn&#39;t planned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kind of a hard read, but here is a document discussing the movement of the carriers out to sea, just hours before the attack.  Basically, all that was left were the shitty boats and personnel.  We all know about the governments lack of concern for military personnel.(Tuskegee Airmen being a good example.)</p>

<p>Here is another link discussing the shitty boats left in port.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While the loss of five battleships and the resultant death of some 1,800 crewmen that morning was tragic, it must be recognized that these ships were far from being the powerful assets they are usually portrayed as being. Most were World War One era dreadnoughts at the end of their service lives (the newest of the them, the West Virginia, had been commissioned almost twenty years earlier) and as such, most were on the verge of being scrapped. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, I&#39;m not saying that it was or wasn&#39;t planned.  I&#39;m saying that there is evidence of shenanigans and as such, I cannot rule out treasonous cocksuckery on the part of Roosevelt. </p>

<p>IMO, the government needed a huge catalyst to get us into the war.  Roosevelt had ran on a platform of non-involvement in Europe.  Americans were united in their opposal to the war.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A pre-war Gallup poll showed 88 percent of Americans opposed U.S. involvement in the European war. </p>

<p>It just wasn&#39;t going to happen without an attack.  </p>

<p>Here is an article describing how FDR provoked Japan into a war with us, just for kix.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rationalrevolution.net/war/fdr_provoked_the_japanese_attack.htm">http://www.rationalrevolution.net/war/fdr_provoked_the_japanese_attack.htm</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whether or not FDR knew about the Japanese plans to attack Pearl Harbor actually misses the larger and more important issue, which is the fact that the Japanese were provoked into attacking America at Pearl Harbor. The majority of Americans, and even service men, were unaware of what was going on behind the scenes, but not all were.  FDR had been charged in public with agitating  for war since 1939. FDR had to push the Japanese into attacking the United States because the overwhelming majority of Americans opposed getting involved in the war and Japan itself had no intentions of attacking the United States, their interest was Asia. Without FDR&#39;s antagonisms towards the Japanese, Congress and the American people never would have allowed FDR to declare war on Japan or Germany; FDR knew this, and he also knew how important it really was that America join in the war against fascism and imperialism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude I am going to put this very very simply for you.</p>

<p>An attack that is prevented with little loss of life will still outrage SOME PEOPLE, but most will be relieved that the attack was stopped.  Relief is a different feeling that outrage and sadness.</p>

<p>At attack that isn&#39;t prevented with a large loss of life will outrage many many more people AND there isn&#39;t the relief that comes with stopping it. </p>

When no public support was offered, they tried again with s shock and awe tactic that did work.

    <div class="md"><p>The way you describe it makes me think you&#39;re envisioning something like an attack on Pearl Harbor being intercepted at approach by US fighter jets. 
 In a case like that I think the decision to retaliate (&quot;you then get to attack them back&quot;) is right<em>ish</em>. </p>

<p>Imagine this; the Americans knew of the Japanese plans to attack Pearl Harbor. Is it justifiable to attack the Japanese before any of their bombers/fighters are up in the air? What if the Japanese would&#39;ve decided at the last second to abort the attack? 
 And what if you knew and played into them? Is that justifiable given the circumstances of WWII?</p>

<p>If you&#39;d argue that attacking the potential enemy before they&#39;d attack you is &#39;allowed&#39;, then you&#39;ll open the door for horrible mistakes. Because how do you proof that someone will attack you? (&quot;Really, there&#39;s not much difference between an actual attack and attempt of attack.&quot;) Ofcourse the horrible mistakes will occasionaly be interrupted by &#39;sweeping victories&#39;.</p>

<p>Often wars attract the biggest kids on the block. The largest, wealthiest and most powerful business and political entities will be involved. Money pours all over the thing. (&quot;We&#39;re under attack and need to act now!&quot; is great for that matter and has been used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire#Political_consequences">in the past</a> with &#39;great success&#39;.)</p>

<p>&quot;Nobody in their right mind would argue against attacking a country that just tried to attack you&quot; This ridicules those who oppose the attack (apparently not in their &#39;right mind&#39;) and promotes a possible pre-emptive strike on grounds of suspicion (at best...at worst it&#39;s a all a ruse to make money) (If by &#39;just tried to attack you&#39; we&#39;re referring to something similar as described in my first sentence, then yes, it&#39;s slightly more reasonable to state that those who oppose an attack are not in their right mind)</p>

<p>Starting a war will always benefit someone or something and therefore &#39;we the people&#39; will have to protect our declarations of war with our lives. They should not be pulled out of the cabinet on a whim (the &quot;holy shit guys, look at what these goddamn crazies were going to do!&quot; kind of thing).</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: about thread question &quot;If the US knew the pearl harbor attack was coming why not just intercept it and start the war anyway?&quot;: </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t looked into anything about pearl harbor so I&#39;ve no idea. But I imagine that if <em>everyone</em> in the us knew the attack was coming it would&#39;ve been prevented in some way (&quot;just intercept it and start the war anyway&quot;). My quess is that not everyone (if any) was &#39;in the know&#39;.
If anyone in the navy got a hold of this info, they would&#39;ve acted, no? </p>

<p>So, how does one gain knowledge of these attacks? What was this information exactly? Did they get their hands on real paper with writings on them (large, sweeping red arrows with little plane and boat icons...) Did the military intercepted messages? Or was it a secret service spy? Was it aquired by an agency outside of the military? Was it discovered by diplomats, interrogation or corruption? </p>

<p>What happened with &#39;the information&#39;? Did it get stuck somewhere in the chain, was it maybe one of many possible attack plans intercepted? Ultimately all of this &#39;what did who know exactly and when did they know it&quot; will remain unanswered I think. It might have been a succesfull surprise attack by the Japanese, or a bold play by the Americans.</p>

<p>So <em>if</em> the us &#39;knew the pearl harbor attack was coming&#39;, the option of playing along with the role of victim/defender could&#39;ve been perceived to be a more favourable route. It might bolster the &#39;war-effort&#39; at home and help cement support and sympathy. Or maybe it was only meant to lure the Japanese in, let them destroy some stuff and then hammer them down. A Pyrrhic victory thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We were very isolationist at that time. Even moreso than in the time leading up to 9/11.</p>

<p>In order for an attempt at an attack to work, we would have had to intercept the Japanese carrier group with a fleet of our own and waited for them to attack. We were not at war at the time. We couldn&#39;t shoot first.</p>

<p>The most likely result of that confrontation would be the Japanese would turn around and go home without firing a shot. The war would keep going on without the USA and the Axis would become stronger over time, taking more and more nations. Britain would definitely have fallen. Russia, maybe, maybe not.</p>

<p>Even if the Japanese obliged with that desire, maybe they would have maybe they wouldn&#39;t, a naval battle out in the Pacific raises different - far lesser - reaction than getting attacked at home.</p>

<p>For a more recent example of why it had to be on American soil, compare and contrast 9/11 with any of the various terrorist attacks on American targets overseas - the Cole, the German nightclub bombing, etc. Very few in America gave two shits about any of those overseas, &quot;smaller&quot; attacks. The majority of the American population was highly pissed off and ready to fight whomever the government pointed at immediately after September 11, 2001.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that the US government <em>orchestrated</em> the Pearl Harbor attack. But I think it&#39;s very plausible that they knew about it ahead of time and let it happen. They knew the USA had to get into the war soon or the likelihood of being overrun later would be too high. They knew the US population was dead nuts against entering the war. That feeling was completely reversed on December 7, 1941.</p>

<p>And even though I think the US government probably did something &quot;shady&quot; there, I find myself having to agree with the actions. Had the US not entered the war when it did or shortly thereafter, that war could have very easily ended differently. As much distaste as I have for the US government today, I would not want to live under a regime like Hitler&#39;s Germany or Hirohito&#39;s Japan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The USA deliberately provoked Japan into attacking by threatening its oil sources over the previous year, monitored the attack progress, and then did not warn perl harbor, so there would be more damage.</p>

<p>At that time in 1941, there was a strong political force to stay out of wars; if the USA had attacked Japan first, there would have been a chance to be frozen out of the European war, which was the true objective of antagonizing the Japanese. If there was no Japanese war, then there would have been no European one. </p>
