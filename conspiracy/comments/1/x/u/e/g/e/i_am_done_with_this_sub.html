Why on earth would that comment be the top one when it is completely ignorant to the video itself?</p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1xu9pp/911_truthers_in_rconspiracy_have_figured_out_our/">http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1xu9pp/911_truthers_in_rconspiracy_have_figured_out_our/</a></p>

<p>Guess where the ~200 upvotes on a ignorant comment came from.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the first, and it won&#39;t be the last, there are a fuck ton of other threads that contain the same despicable content when the conversations become interesting.</p>

<p>I am done, completley tired of this circus. This sub let this point be reached, this sub allowed r/tards to have fun mocking us and allowed them to interfere with the articles&#39; progression. For the past month there hasn&#39;t been any discussion worth having in here that doesn&#39;t contain ignorant excuses for humans derailing the conversations with unrelated spam, tactics of entrapment and insults.</p>

<p>I asked for more strict measures to be taken before, nothing changed and because of that it only became worse.</p>

<p>It&#39;s disgusting to see how low this has come and it is even more sad to see that there is an entire sub dedicated to ruining another while thinking highly of themselves, people that are addicted to hurt others that think differently and feel proud about it.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve had a huge problem with voting manipulation for years, this isn&#39;t something new. It&#39;s also a natural reaction to steer such an open outlet like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, especially if the content is true and incriminating. You don&#39;t see the amount of downvotes <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> receives in other subreddits. </p>

<p>However, while they manipulate the voting system, it&#39;s still a difficult task for them. You can bet your ass that they upvoted that top comment with multiple accounts. The best way to counteract their sabotage is simply contribute as much as possible to this subreddit, which makes your departure damaging.</p>

<p>I would ask you to reconsider and actually be more involved to at least make their &quot;jobs&quot; more difficult. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would add that I&#39;m not sure I will be sticking around either. In one month online, I&#39;ve found myself becoming much more coarse in my comments to people, as well as making judgments that I would never make in person. People are just so nasty to each other online, and so quick to judge. And it comes from both sides.</p>

<p>I just gave my opinion on one aspect of 9/11, saying I believed planes did hit the pentagon. I was personally attacked comment after comment for stating that opinion and giving some evidence that had persuaded me on that particular piece. I was treated horribly for not agreeing there was a missile, and immediately called a &quot;shill&quot; and &quot;disinfo agent&quot; among other things.</p>

<p>It seems this format lends itself to snap judgements, name calling and insular thought. I have many serious questions and doubts about 9/11 and who was involved. It is nearly impossible to discuss however.</p>

<p>Add in people who want to ridicule even having questions, and there seems to be little room to gain knowledge. Such is communication in this era.</p>

<p>Yeah, we all go through that. You still need to remember to be as true to yourself as possible. Though I know that it&#39;s easier said than done. I&#39;ve found many of my days get ruined by some insulting comments, and simple things like &quot;retard&quot; or &quot;idiot&quot; I actually find hurtful, which sometimes make me shut this damn page off. But if you&#39;re like me and enjoy a rational discussion in real life, then you should also let that guide you here. It&#39;s good to distance yourself from your ego as well and change your mind on things, which is still difficult as fuck, but good for you. </p>

<p>You need to know that the Pentagon incident in particular is highly controversial, even among those who shun the official story. A group called CIT (citizens investigation team) gathered testimony from eyewitnesses that turned the incident on its head even among &quot;truthers&quot; and there is still a huge split in the movement. They claim that there was a plane, but it flew over the Pentagon without hitting it, while most think it was a drone or a missile. If you listen to the witnesses&#39; testimonies, you&#39;d probably find it very reliable as many do. I&#39;m personally split on the issue (literally 50/50) and distance myself from the discussion as much as possible. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, we&#39;ve had a lot of what you might call &quot;shills&quot; or people with an agenda who create new accounts and try to sabotage the comments section. And you having a new account might have contributed to people suspecting you of being one of them. My account is much older, but I still got accused of being a shill last week by a member here for disagreeing with his economic ideas. He made a huge fuss about it, but it made me laugh, which is what you also need to do about the accusations. Some people are overly paranoid, which might affects their judgement.</p>

<p>That said, I&#39;ve personally also accused some users of being shills, when I&#39;m 100% certain that they are. I can give you at least one concrete example in a PM. </p>

<p>Wow, this turned out longer than intended. Sorry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah. Intentionally trying to hide certain comments? Or just submissions in general? That makes sense now for my comment in the Libertarian subreddit. My comment pointed out one particular thing Obama was doing wasn&#39;t illegal (I didn&#39;t support it, just pointed out it wasn&#39;t illegal). I received dozens of downvotes, despite what I posted being correct. Obama is hated there, so my comment was seen as &quot;pro-Obama&quot;. Voting it down hides the comment at some point.</p>

<p>The only comments I downvote are personal attacks or racist/angry comments. I upvote comments that challenge my position. I see it as up to me to make my point. The idea that people come here just to try to hide other people&#39;s comments is something I will have to absorb going forward.</p>

<p>That&#39;s still a bit different from what they do here. Your comment was more like throwing a lamb into shark infested waters, it was bound to be attacked. Those who manipulate the voting system here have no interest in the topics discussed. They do it to silence the content so less people see it. If you browse the &quot;new&quot; tab, you would notice pretty quickly after a while which content is targeted. </p>

<p>I have to clarify that this isn&#39;t only limited to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, it happens elsewhere, while there&#39;s less censorship by the mods here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The top comment I see has less than one hundred votes. It is a detailed comment covering one point of the movie. I see this as healthy. Why not just provide rebuttal, rather than complaining? The post seems to have a lot of detail, which is what the OP asked for.</p>

<p>The comment certainly isn&#39;t an all encompassing rebuttal. I personally like detailed conversation on the subject matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well truth be told it wasn&#39;t an actual rebuttal.  There was a 2hr span with no intercept and his response was &quot;there wasn&#39;t enough time&quot; when in fact the system is completely automated (15 mins at most to intercept).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know that your 15 minute claim is accurate. The golfer Payne Stewart&#39;s plane was intercepted. It took 80 minutes (time zone shift must be considered). That&#39;s the example I used to use until I found out about the different time zones. I thought is was 18 minutes. It was really an hour and 18 minutes.</p>

<p>Do you have any examples of 15 minute intercept times? I&#39;d love to be able to save those links.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I understand that. They had lost contact with the plane, and asked for an intercept, same as if it was off course. I&#39;m just saying it took 78 minutes for the intercept. You said 15 minutes at most. I was wondering if you had some real world examples, because I was shot down with my Payne Stewart example once the time zone shift was understood in the timeline.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your information seems to be conflicting.  The 1 hr 18 minute intercept time is due to change in EST/CST timezones.  Apparently it may have been 18 minutes, but it&#39;s still being debated.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>According to NTSB logs, it was 39 minutes from ATC requesting dispatch to visual, but I do find a lot of varying information.  <a href="http://www.911myths.com/index.php/Payne_Stewart">http://www.911myths.com/index.php/Payne_Stewart</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, good idea. Fuck it. Hey mods, if you want people to stay, figure out a way to keep us here. Pretty soon you&#39;ll be moderating nothing but trolls and shills until you give up on the sub yourself. </p>

<p>We can&#39;t have one regular conversation here. Not a single fucking one. So, trolls, good job. I suppose this is what you wanted. Peace out fuckers. You ruined the sub. Now pat yourself on the back and enjoy your brief little victory. </p>

<p>Edit: Yea, I dont even want the chance to wander back to this place. Fuck this account too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is probably a good time to do this en masse. The trolls want people to make fun of. So this entire sub is just a huge waste of time because it&#39;s almost literally <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> version 2, since they&#39;re always here and make up a large percentage of the members. How about we just all delete our accounts and grab picket signs, hand out fliers, etc...</p>

<p>This sub just serves as a ghetto for our ideas. Get out and spread the fucking movement. How long do we have to wait and bitch about it online? Fuck <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>. They can shill themselves with all of their sock accounts. shills shilling shills. Let them keep themselves busy. I&#39;m out as well. There&#39;s absolutely no reason to stay in a place that is unrecoverable. It&#39;s done. They won a long time ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try and take your emotion out of it and realize it&#39;s just a game.  The sub was gamed hard and that&#39;s how it works now.  I have seen your posts and they are very good so please stick around, just remember that when we hit the front page - things will go sour fast.  Pretend you are in a classroom of 10 year old, would you let them get the best of you?  If there is a place that isn&#39;t yet compromised I certainly don&#39;t know if it.</p>

<p>I have always been in favor of an outright ban of anyone associated with conspiratard but we aren&#39;t there yet.  The top poster in the thread you speak of, is a blatant $hill and is quite well known.  If you actually corner him/her with facts, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1xslls/911_the_new_pearl_harbor_irrefutable_proof_the/cfefvvn?context=3">as I did they simply spew incoherent garbage</a>, effectively drowning the good information out.  This is exactly what the purpose is, so anyone &#39;grazing&#39; the information will quickly lose interest.  </p>

<p>So, take a deep breath and realize you are not going to &#39;win&#39;, ever.  But if you can change only one mind, it&#39;s still worth it.  You have posted some damn good stuff, so please hang in there.</p>
