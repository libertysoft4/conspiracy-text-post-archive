    Now that I am older I can see how utterly fucked things are, as I sit here, all across the globe people are starving, dying, being raped and killed, murdered, and tortured. People like me, people with feelings, people who are utterly suffering, and what do I do about it? Nothing, I go on with my life, and try not to think about it. 
    Now I have grown sick of this, I cannot take it anymore, people are complaining about equality in America, better wages, more jobs and less taxes, while people on this planet, right now struggle to find their next meal, or find clean water. All the while I worry about what shirt to wear to the party tonight. Just because we cant see these people suffering, doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t there.
   I am not asking you to donate to charities, or start a movement, all I want you to do for now is think about these people, acknowledge the world we live in, talk to friends about it, do what you can. Change needs to happen, we need to care about all of humanity as though they were our brothers. Because they are. Anyone who feels, thinks and breathes should be treated as our equal, and be cared for as our equal. Think about it.</p>

<p>I hear you. Same situation for me. All I can reasonably think to do is educate myself as much as possible and to not allow myself to fall into the same traps that I see most good Americans fall into. High paying job that does nothing for anybody (finance/advertising and the like)</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>All are responsible for all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If someone doesn&#39;t agree with that statement, should they be free from the responsibility?  The way I see it, that attitude makes for a very oppressive mentality to begin with.  If I misunderstand what you mean by it, my bad.</p>

<p>If me and bob are working the fields, but bob can&#39;t work for whatever reason, would it be ok to force me to work twice as much(for free) to help bob out?  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I would probably do everything I could to help my buddy out just out of the kindness of my heart, but would it be ok for someone else to force me to do the extra work(for free), so that bob still gets his check?  Even if the work was distributed to more workers who had to work less time each(for free) so that bob doesn&#39;t miss his check, it wouldn&#39;t make it any more ok.</p>

<p>I have compassion, and the world is fucked up, but it is not the US governments job to end suffering around the world.  It just isn&#39;t.  If anything, churches should be at the forefront of feeding the poor and helping the downtrodden.  They would probably be more efficient anyways.  Not to mention people like Jesus fed the poor and whatnot, so it makes sense.  Not saying they should be forced, only that it would definitely be following what I think Jesus would want(I&#39;m not religious, just using Jesus because of the large Christian population).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t come up with that phrase, firstly, I read it in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Key-True-Encounter-Whitley-Strieber/dp/1585428698/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1389363725&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=the+key+whitley+strieber">The Key by Whitley Streiber</a> and it stuck with me but I&#39;ll tell you what I think of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If someone doesn&#39;t agree with that statement, should they be free from the responsibility?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IMO, no. I would liken this concept to the fact that we all have mass and we all are connected within the field of gravity effecting each other no matter how insignificant. You can not escape the responsibility you have by not believing in it just as you can&#39;t escape gravitational pull if you don&#39;t believe in it. Though it may seem oppressive on the surface I believe that in the long run a global culture of compassion will lead to a quality of life that we can only dream about. Of course with the aid of technology.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If me and bob are working the fields, but bob can&#39;t work for whatever reason, would it be ok to force me to work twice as much(for free) to help bob out?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say that it would be okay to <em>force</em> you to work, but if the work <em>needs</em> to be done then maybe you do it if able or maybe you do some of it or maybe you do none of it (you&#39;ve had a long day after all). Depending on how necessary it is to be done and if it&#39;s capable to share the load. If this work benefits mankind with a culture of compassion I&#39;m sure that people would not mind doing the work at all.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I think you&#39;re absolutely correct. It&#39;s not the US government&#39;s job. US government is a system of economic and social control. This control is only utilized to gain <em>more</em> control and if it benefits the citizens of the country, which would be smart to keep the citizens placated and patriotic, then so be it. The churches are systems of spiritual control which good people often naively believe can help the masses. They cannot because they divide themselves from the rest of humanity with absurd religious concepts. It is the duty of every man to make sure that every other man is taken care of because we are all one species on one planet. Like, it&#39;s selfishness put into practice. The best way to help yourself is to help each other.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in that phrase I suggest you read that book. Anyways, I hope that answered your questions and I appreciate your questioning. :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your ideas are oppressive because you would end up forcing people like me into your society that we would want no part off.</p>

<p>And no, all are not responsible for all.  History has proven that it doesn&#39;t work.  It just doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>The fact that you think people should just work for free for others baffles me.  It almost makes me think you have never had to work to support yourself, no offense intended.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but in reality, your ideas would not work.  You cannot get everyone to agree that they are responsible for others, and those that disagree will be oppressed by people like you, who believe that even if I don&#39;t agree, I must be forced to comply.  That&#39;s oppression my friend.</p>

<p>Edit: Oh, I only said churches should do the helping because it isn&#39;t the governments job to end suffering, and churches seem to enjoy trying to do that stuff.  I&#39;m just saying let the people who want to help others do so.  You would be surprised what people do to help each other.  Nobody needs I be forced to give, and the phrase &quot;all are responsible for all&quot; basically means ending suffering around the world in the long run.  That battle will never be won.  It&#39;s grasping for utopia...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think we all decided on this system of governance? It&#39;s not like I have a choice whether or not I have to pay taxes or even what taxes I pay. We&#39;re already being oppressed. No I haven&#39;t had to support myself yet. No offence taken. You keep saying &quot;pay&quot; as in money. But money is also a form of oppression. It doesn&#39;t hold any real wealth in itself (USA I mean) all it is is debt. Look into fractional reserve banking if you haven&#39;t already. This system we have now already forces people to work for others the difference between the system built on compassion and this one is the system now is destroying the planet, creating slaves, creates class warfare and creates a whole lot of worthless material shit that nobody needs all in the name of profit. Idk what you consider oppressive but this seems pretty oppressive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah man, not saying out current tax system and monetary system doesn&#39;t oppress.  If anything our current system is heading more and more in the, &quot;all are responsible for all&quot; direction.  I don&#39;t agree with it, and you are right that I don&#39;t really have a choice.  It&#39;s my personal opinion that it&#39;s morally wrong to take what people don&#39;t want to give.  It&#39;s always proposed as a way to make things fair.  In reality, when you take from people who don&#39;t consent, only to redistribute to other people, it&#39;s robbery.  I mean, can I come into your home and take 30-40% of your belongings and redistribute it to people who don&#39;t have as much as you just because I believe you have more than you need?</p>

<p>I am not speaking of taxation for defense purposes, because that actually does benefit everyone, just taxation for the purpose of redistribution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, I had to think on your post for a while. Yes, my idea of &quot;all responsible for all&quot; is oppressive. But I guess I have to ask, what system isn&#39;t oppressive? capitalism often doesn&#39;t give people their most basic human needs and is hierarchical by nature and communism is stealing. maybe anarchy doesn&#39;t oppress, but then there&#39;s no system. So let&#39;s go to the base level of being human and what limitations that gives us. </p>

<ul>
<li>we are in physical bodies. we require nourishment and water and shelter to continue to live.</li>
</ul>

<p>And the Earth is where we all live and we arose from it&#39;s current ecosystem. So it should be in unified human interest to protect our ecosystem from destruction and pollution. But it&#39;s not. I would have to say that I align myself with this planet and the other biological entities on it. I&#39;ll also say that it&#39;s my belief that the best way to thrive on this planet is to take care of others so they can in turn take care of you. Shit&#39;s complicated though.

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly, but because others are living desperate lives does not negate your own problems and how they feel to you. It may temper them a bit- being mindful of others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Acknowledging it and discussing it is a must, but its not enough, I imagine most who come to this sub gets some odd satisfaction from knowing what many others don&#39;t. This is enough for them, and the few who physically want to make a difference are unable to do <em>anything</em> due to this colossal consumer-producer spell we&#39;re under. Since it is clear that we don&#39;t have a say in the matter, and I mean a real voice, of how a country is run, the change you speak of should be focused on yourself. People are so reliant on the lives the government and corporations established for them, that they will agree to anything they want without putting up much fight... to me, the most inhumane act is the unknowing support, through tax dollars, of military operations <em>outside</em> their country, under the guise of self defense, even when there are still unanswered questions -that really has many intelligent people baffled- regarding the 9/11 catalyst. If you think you live in a corrupt system that many are satisfied with, would it be easier to change the system? or leave it? I get sick when I think about how terrible all paths away from the system are, but ultimately I think its the only choice worth considering... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Compassion and empathy has been marginalized to naivety. What we need is knowledge and direction to channel these feelings of human brokenness. Knowledge pertaining to our unconscious role in keeping the poor in a state of desperation. Could it be that the privileged way of life relies on the abuse of other countries&#39; resources? Could it be that our compliance and consistent funding of this system is what keeps the rest down? Or do they keep themselves down? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another thing</p>

<p>It is my belief that humanity can and will pull itself out of desperation in the absence of oppression. Therefore our duty lies not overseas, not in donating to international organizations, but rather right here in the belly of the beast, refusing to fund the invisible forces and special business interests that keep us so cozy at the expense of another&#39;s oppression. And if we are successful, then those whom you deeply feel for will finally come together and thrive in the absence of western capitalist oppression. But this theory lies on an assumption which I cannot yet prove- is it that simple? Is our way of life directly connected to the oppression of others?</p>

<p>If so, then we can unite under one simple principle of tax withholding: <strong>Don&#39;t feed the beast. Feed the peace</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the problem lies with our interventions, our constant meddling with other cultures and the continued conquest of global democracy.  </p>

<p>Fucked up shit happens, that is the way of the world.  If you try to solve everyone&#39;s problems, <em>someone</em> or some group will end up oppressed, even if it&#39;s temporary.  </p>

<p>In order to feed the poor, who is going to work for free so that the poor people can eat for free?  If people don&#39;t volunteer, forcing them to work for nothing to feed the poor would probably make them unmotivated sloths and bring food production down over time, and after a while the problem is larger than before.  If the workers aren&#39;t going to work for free, is the owner going to pay for it?  Why should the owner of a company be responsible for the well being of someone else just because they are successful? This isn&#39;t even taking into account the cost of packaging the food, transporting it, and then coming up with a system of distribution that will always end up being abused on the local level.  How is this done for free?  No matter what, <em>someone</em> or some group of people have to make a sacrifice to accomplish that type of help, and nobody likes to be forced into anything.  Even tax payers.  If a tax is forced onto me, it is just state endorsed robbery.  Why can I not opt out of getting health care and not have to pay taxes that go towards that social service?  Because our representatives promise to rob some people and give the loot to others.</p>

<p>Edit:  wouldn&#39;t it be cool of we could vote on policy with our tax dollars?  Like let&#39;s say there are government programs A, B, &amp; C.  Anyone who likes what A is doing can choose to add a maximum amount of $x to that program.  Once the programs funding is met for the year, tax dollars cannot be put into the program unless the program requests more tax dollars at whichever point more money could be added to the budget.  Anyone could add as little or as much to any government program so long as it didn&#39;t exceed some pre-determined amount.  It would be like a super democracy where you could truly support what you believed instead of hoping some emotionally detached individual will actually represent you or your community.  The thought kind of just popped into my head, so I&#39;m sure there are major flaws, but hell, thought it might make for good discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your proposed system of taxing is exactly what I am hinting at. It&#39;s the perfect solution because the mass majority of us would gladly pay for some things and probably refuse to pay for the military. With a defunded military, we may finally see if the bullied countries can provide for themselves.</p>

<p>You see, we don&#39;t have to volunteer our time to fix global problems. That is not sustainable. We just have to make sure that we are not <em>causing</em> the problems. The most we can ever do for our fellow man is fix our self. Instead we live the entirety of our lives as broken children pointing fingers, paving our good intentioned path to hell. But the solution always lies within. To fix yourself is to fix the world, because you are an inseparable part of it. Beneath our islands of ego we all touch underwater, we are all connected, we are one.</p>

<p>This tax idea deserves its own post. Let&#39;s get that going.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get the sense from your post that you don&#39;t think it is right for people in privileged, developed countries like America to complain about certain aspects of their lives when there is suffering to a much larger degree occurring in other places. This is not the right way to look at things.</p>

<p>One of the key concepts of the state as the highest sovereign body is that it promotes competition between different states. These states ultimately aim to sustain themselves as a paramount national interest goal. This is good because it means each state is supposedly focusing much of their attention in making their own individual region a quality place to reside. So, when you claim that America should be focusing on others to a much larger degree, then you are ignoring one of the fundamental principles and objectives of statehood. The duty of the maintenance of human rights makes more sense if it is placed in the hands of intergovernmental organisations such as the UN.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need to focus on the problems we have right here, right now, in America and in other Western nations. Sorry, but we can&#39;t waste our energies worrying about people starving in Africa -- they are going to keep starving no matter what we might do, because their own people can&#39;t feed themselves. They are so fucking useless, they can&#39;t secure enough food for themselves to eat. That&#39;s about as useless as a people can get. So, no, I won&#39;t be worrying about them, thanks, I will be worrying about my own future, and the future of my family and those I care about, as the elite continue to rape my country and take away my freedoms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a close-minded and ignorant viewpoint to take. You classify africans as &quot;fucking useless&quot; because certain parts of it are having difficulties with poverty through no fault of their own? You truly are a horrible person.</p>
