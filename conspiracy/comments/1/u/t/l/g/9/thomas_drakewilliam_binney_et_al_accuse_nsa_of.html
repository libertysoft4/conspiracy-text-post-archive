<hr/>

<p>&quot;The sadder reality, Mr. President, is that NSA itself had enough information to prevent 9/11, but chose to sit on it rather than share it with the FBI or CIA. We know; we were there. We were witness to the many bureaucratic indignities that made NSA at least as culpable for pre-9/11 failures as are other U.S. intelligence agencies...</p>

<p>...“My first day on the job at NSA was 9/11. I was immediately charged as the lead NSA executive to find and deploy the best technology at NSA for the fight against terrorism....</p>

<p>...“That’s where I found the pre- and post-9/11 intelligence from NSA monitoring of some of the hijackers as they planned the attacks of 9/11 had not been shared outside NSA. This includes critical pre-9/11 intelligence on al-Qaeda, even though it had been worked on by NSA analysts. I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements. That report also was not disseminated outside of NSA.</p>

<p>“Make no mistake. That data and the analytic report could have, should have prevented 9/11...</p>

<p>...“In short, when confronted with the prospect of fessing up, NSA chose instead to obstruct the 9/11 congressional investigation, play dumb, and keep the truth buried, including the fact that it knew about all inbound and outbound calls to the safe house switchboard in Yemen. NSA’s senior leaders took me off the task because they realized – belatedly, for some reason – that I would not take part in covering up the truth about how much NSA knew but did not share.</p>

<p>“When the 9/11 Commission hearings began, Director Hayden chortled at executive staff meetings over the fact that the FBI and CIA were feeling the heat for not having prevented 9/11. This was particularly difficult for me to sit through, for I was aware that NSA had been able to cover up its own culpability by keeping investigators, committees, and commissions away from the truth.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Crazy theory time:</p>

<p>So the Bush admin neocons, led by Cheney and the PNAC crowd, were responsible for all U.S. reaction to 9/11. Make sure the planes aren&#39;t shot down, make sure the right talking heads say the right things, and to make sure the FAA, USAF, NORAD, NEADS, and other domestic agencies didn&#39;t get in the way.</p>

<p>This is a risky move, because there are a lot of strings in that bureaucratic web that need to be pulled. An ungodly amount of behind the scenes arm twisting, favors, and reach-arounds had to occur for this to work. And we all know how good the U.S. Federal government is at keeping secrets, especially ones that involve a lot of people. (Don&#39;t say Manhattan project, it wasn&#39;t treason.)</p>

<p>FTA:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sitting here, asking myself why the neocons and PNAC gang would be so reckless, leaving a paper trail, using so many pawns, setting in motion so many moving parts... They <em>had</em> to understand that there was a risk that such a world-changing event would trigger unprecedented investigation and scrutiny. That is, unless, they did not know just how bad 9/11 would be.</p>

<p>Which leads me wonder: What if the neocons were never informed that the WTC towers would be demolished?</p>

<p>It sounded insane to me when I first thought of it. But then I started a mental list of people and assets that would be needed to rig the towers and keep it under wraps. Could the zionists <em>really</em> do this without tipping their hand? </p>

<p>It starts to make sense when you realize that Mossad didn&#39;t necessarily need the Americans to know what was going to happen, but rather only convince them to allow it to happen. Mossad went through a lot of trouble weaving the tale of the hijackers and leaving the right breadcrumbs in the right places. (The passport found on a sidewalk in NY was a bit overkill though...fucking idiots.)</p>

<p>This tale was convincing enough to fool U.S. intelligence, and they bought into the fairy tale hook line and sinker. They were fed a seemingly legitimate terror plot to fly the planes into the WTC towers. This lines up with the intent shown by the FBI&#39;s involvement in the 1993 WTC bombing. They probably figured a couple holes in each tower, a few hundred dead, and four planes was a small price for the political advantage gained. All they had to do was look dumb enough to let the Arabs fly the planes.</p>

<p>I bet they were pissed when the towers collapsed. Everyone involved in allowing that terror plot saw this happen and knew that they were on the hook for some seriously treasonous shit. A network of intelligence personnel all froze in fear simultaneously as they realized that they had been fooled... by someone... someone above them.</p>

<p>PNACheney knows full well that they can&#39;t turn on Mossad and start pointing fingers because they&#39;re complicit. The existing paper trail in America&#39;s own files implicates domestic leaders more than Israel&#39;s.</p>

<p>This theory requires that the neocon gang was somewhat ignorant of the full extent of zionist control. Every step of the plan involving physical assets was controlled by Israeli Mossad, or their zionist diaspora. The WTC towers were privatized, sold, purchased, managed, secured, and regulated by Jews with documented personal loyalty to Israel. Airport security at Logan was run by ICTS, a company founded by Shin Bet agents. The planes were likely modified by SPC, Zakheim&#39;s company. The Israeli spies captured after 9/11 were released under Michael Chertoff&#39;s watch as head of the DOJ&#39;s criminal division. WTC7s emergency bunker was not used, as the head of the NY Office of Emergency Management was a zionist Jew.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to divert blame from my domestic suspects, they are a bunch of traitorous fucks who need to be worked out of every facet of power. But this theory makes so much more sense in light of the leaks coming out. The more evidence we have, they more we should refine our theories. That&#39;s how it works.</p>

<p>Not some made up bullshit or a TV/newspaper report, an actual report made by the FBI and the Newark Police and it is <em>damning</em>. There&#39;s no way that these people weren&#39;t involved in some capacity, no way. After you read it you will understand that  these people knew the attack would take place and documented it as it happened.</p>

<p>The Israelis also lived in close proximity to the hijackers in more than one case which considering the rest of the &#39;coincidences&#39;, it cannot be a coincidence they lived in the same place at the same time.</p>
