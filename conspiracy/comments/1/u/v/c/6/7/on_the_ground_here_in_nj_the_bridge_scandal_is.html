        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I live in Atlantic City. My family, and many people I know, have been directly affected by Christie&#39;s policies. There is so much more to bury Christie with. This bridge scandal is the equivalent of catching a drug kingpin and letting him go with a seatbelt violation.</p>

<p>It starts with Sandy. At least, this is what I know. Most of this stuff has had little to no coverage in the media. <strong>Follow closely, because the reason this isn&#39;t getting news coverage is that it&#39;s a little complicated. People are too dumb to pay attention this long.</strong></p>

<p>My family is living in half of a house, barely better than a crack den, because of Sandy. It has been over a year, and we are unable to rebuild. We are not alone in this situation. I have just heard that in Little Egg Harbor Township, there are over 5000 empty homes due to Sandy. On my block here in Atlantic City, two of my neighbors have abandoned their houses. Eventually, my family will do the same, handing over the keys to the bank.</p>

<p>-Now, when the storm hit, FEMA threw money at the state left and right, with no oversight. Dispersal of funds was left up to the state. This is a key thing to remember. </p>

<p>-<strong>From this giant pile of money, Christie gives a no-bid contract for cleanup to a company that his political crony had controlling shares in. Right there, that&#39;s enough for an investigation. There&#39;s more, but that is plenty.</strong></p>

<p>-People with flood insurance (a national program backed by FEMA funding) had to wait for close to 6 months to even have an adjuster come out to their property, let alone see a dime. People WITHOUT flood insurance were being handed $30k checks like they were candy, within weeks of the storm. Remember, funds were being dispersed at the state level.</p>

<p>-People WITH flood insurance (remember, flood insurance is backed by FEMA, but FEMA allowed the funds to be distributed at the state level, and the state level FEMA department has the final say on how much money your insurance pays out), after close to a year of waiting, end up with about half of the funds needed to restore their homes. Note, this is just to restore their homes. People who have FHA mortgages (a large amount of people) are required to raise their house if they are in a flood zone. This can double the cost of rehabbing the home.</p>

<p>-This in turn leads to people taking what little cash they got, and abandoning their home, as they are unable to complete repairs. This works out greatly in the banks&#39; favor. First, the bank gets the property, which it then auctions off. Then, the bank will be insured for the remainder of the capital. This equals one giant, quick payday.</p>

<p>-People wishing to appeal the amount they received in their flood insurance payout have to present their case to a state-level FEMA board. So far, there has been a less than 1% success rate.</p>

<p>-Only now, over a year after the storm, is there an attempt to track down where all the money went. It sure as fuck didn&#39;t go to people who paid for it.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR - A fuckton of money entered the state after Sandy. It was severely mishandled, leading to a mass exodus from the state, and thousands of abandoned homes. It has done more damage than Sandy ever did. That money was handed out on a first-come-first-serve basis to Christie&#39;s friends, with scraps leftover for the people. This has led to a large windfall of money right into the banks&#39; hands, instead of homeowners who deserve it. No one is talking about this, and it is so much more important than a traffic jam. Christie has either colluded in this situation, or has passively allowed it to happen. By crucifying Christie for a much more minor offense, and ignoring this larger one, we are passively giving consent for his successor to continue with this behavior.</strong></p>

<p>Christie deserves your hatred, but punish him for the proper crime.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT- Some sources I have been able to scrounge up</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.mortgageorb.com/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.14551">Here</a> is a source that the rolling stone used, describing the drastic increase in foreclosure rates, just in NY. This is after banks are putting moratoriums on foreclosures, which means it&#39;s the homeowners choosing to foreclose, not the banks. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/breaking/christie-gets-mixed-reception-in-first-visit-to-little-egg/article_fe911d08-40fc-11e3-8f12-0019bb2963f4.html">&quot;Last month, the Ocean County Planning Board estimated that 4.5 percent of the county’s 576,567 people have not returned to their homes since Sandy.&quot;</a> That number comes out to almost 26,000 people, from just one county. (I&#39;ll work on finding a better source for this, since it&#39;s a little buried).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.addictinginfo.org/2013/10/29/hurricane-sandy-one-year-later/">Here</a> is one of the few places I&#39;ve seen actually discussing people getting short-changed by their insurance. As far as I know, no one has actually collected any statistics on this.</p>

<p>The Press of Atlantic City reported that the NJ Department of Community Affairs is investigating the distribution of Sandy funds, but I can&#39;t find the article, since the press of AC has a paygate.</p>

<p>I apologize that there is such scant information available, and I greatly wish there was more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There will be a revolt but only at the last possible second. Humans only act when there back is up against the wall. I think the battles will be started over gun registration and confiscation personally but it could happen sooner. That&#39;s the only reason were not a &quot;complete nazi state&quot; right now..  Guns. When people in Arizona and Texas start getting asked to register guns, you will see either an uproar or you will see a straight revolt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it really is. I tried having a discussion with him about tax dollars being sent to Israel to help a terrorist state. He looked at me like the anti-christ. The first thing him and my aunt said was aren&#39;t there a lot of jews that live around here? as if I was saying something that shouldn&#39;t be said aloud. </p>

<p>I told him even if religious scripture said it was there home, it would be against god to kill people just to absorb that land.. They are still occupiers on someone else&#39;s land. First thing he said to that.. Israelis don&#39;t like getting bombed. I had to laugh as I was talking to a brick wall. I tried explaining to him that Palestinians don&#39;t have jets and bomber&#39;s to bomb Israeli&#39;s but the opposite is true. He glared me down for a couple minutes with his hands shaking. I struck a cord to say the least. </p>

<p>My family is very hungarian and this came on the back of what&#39;s going on in Hungary lately with a supposedly extremely anti-Semitic government group taking. Of course all the mainstream news is up in arms against Hungary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>400 people own more than 60% of the American people. One family, the Waltons, owns more than 48 million Americans. 300 billionaires own more than 3 billion people. Give them another 20 years and a few hundred people will own almost everything and we&#39;ll all be their slaves. </p>

<p>In socialism we&#39;d own our house, our car, our TV, our computers, our stuff, while the big things, the land, the rivers, the oceans, the factories would be own by everyone, communally. There would be no wealthy people with power. The only power would be elected power. So yeah, I have to go with socialism/communism as a better system. Don&#39;t point at Russia. They did it wrong. They had no history of democracy and without democracy there&#39;s no corrective mechanism. </p>

I inherited a beach house on LBI and my god that island is still wrecked up too. Thank god my grandfather had sense to buy into the biggest part of the island, and the only damage w had were missing shingles and a bent door.

    <div class="md"><p>We have to use space heaters in each room, which is killing our electric bill.</p>

<p>To sum up, the first floor of my house was completely wiped out. No kitchen, no laundry room, no living room, no dining room. We cook using a hot plate and a microwave (sometimes a crockpot). Although we need to make sure all the heaters are off before we use the microwave or it trips the breakers (you&#39;d be surprised how easy it is to forget about this). We store food in 3 mini-fridges, which can&#39;t really keep anything frozen well so we can&#39;t store food longer than 3 days before it starts to turn (you&#39;d be surprised how fast your grocery bills rack up when you need to go shopping every 3 days, instead of when there are sales and just freezing). We wash our dishes in the bathroom, and the toilet is our garbage disposal. Luckily we live in a city, so there&#39;s a laundromat down a few blocks from my house. </p>

<p>Even keeping things locked up upstairs (there is a door that keeps the upstairs and downstairs separated), and running 4 space heaters, we still had ice on the inside of our windows this past week. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not looking for pity. We get by. I just want people to realize that a lot of families are still dealing with shit from Sandy, just like Katrina. Putting up bumper stickers that say &quot;restore the shore!&quot; or &quot;jersey strong!&quot; or &quot;Do AC&quot; doesn&#39;t help anyone. A commercial with a fat guy and his happy family at the beach hasn&#39;t fixed anything (BTW, the ad campaign was paid for with Sandy relief funds). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That just isn&#39;t true, yeah the beach blocks are wealthier but a majority isn&#39;t. Quite a few of the people I know were paid by their flood insurance, and paid private contractors with the money they got from their insurance. They weren&#39;t rich folks paying it out of their padded bank accounts. That just didn&#39;t happen. They followed the guidelines on their policies and did their paperwork right.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand how AC could be that much different. I have close friends on St. David&#39;s place by the Albany Ave/BHP bridge that got hit with the brunt of the flooding (like those couple blocks always do when it is above normal rainfall) and they were fixed within a month or so. Believe they were NOT what you would call rich by any friggen means. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll explain my situation, which is a very common one. </p>

<p>Those people that were able to rebuild with what they got from the insurance probably already had their houses paid off, which meant they did not have to raise their house to meet the new flood zone guidelines. If you have a mortgage in a flood zone, most of the time you are required to raise your house. </p>

<p>We have an FHA mortgage in a flood zone. In order to meet the guidelines and keep our flood insurance at our current rates, we would have had to raise our house. Our house was built in the 1930s (like much of this neighborhood), using balloon construction. This means the house is too structurally unstable to raise (a common problem after the storm regardless of how your house was made). This means we have to tear down completely and rebuild on pilings.</p>

<p>We were appraised at $150k worth of damage. That was just to restore the house as it was, not including any raising. We got $85k. That&#39;s nowhere near enough to tear down a house, remove the debris, drive pilings, and then build a home on top. Can&#39;t be done. Hell, it could barely be done even if we got the $150k we were appraised at.</p>

<p>My situation is quite common throughout areas affected by Sandy. Maybe not the exact same circumstances, but they have been prevented from properly rebuilding by insurance not paying out properly for the damage they have received. </p>

<p>It is a system designed to give incentive to homeowners to hand the keys over to the bank, so that the bank can then collect on its own mortgage protection insurance. The people then take what little insurance money they got (of which a sizeable portion is held by the bank they have a mortgage under), leave the state and put a down payment on a cheaper house. They lose whatever equity they had, and another bank (or maybe the same bank) has a brand new source of income. It has been a huge payday for the banks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry but again you&#39;re wrong. These people didn&#39;t have their homes paid off. They were young and paying mortgages. They just didn&#39;t carry the lowest insurance plans. Two of the people I am speaking of had to build from the ground up. Between FEMA and insurance they could. Why were you not carrying enough insurance for your home? Your town is under the water table. It floods when it rains and it&#39;s during high tide. It&#39;s not some government conspiracy you should have taken those things into consideration. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only way in which we skimped on our flood insurance was depreciation of contents (which we only found out about after the storm, as we would have gladly paid more to ensure that we were able to get enough to replace those contents). The insurance on the house itself was top of the line.</p>

<p><strong>We were insured up to $250,000 worth of damages.</strong> </p>

<p>Furthermore, not everyone was eligible for a FEMA handout. The only way for us to get any money from FEMA was through a small business loan they were offering, which we could not afford. Beyond that there was a program that gave you $10k if you signed something saying you would not leave the county for 3 years, but that still wasn&#39;t enough. Even if we were eligible for a FEMA grant, they topped out at $30k, which still would not have been enough.</p>

<p>We were not unprepared for this storm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe your friends got screwed by a shitty contractor, leaving things out so that he could lowball his estimate. A common problem in this regard is people leaving beams and supports that were submerged in saltwater. The wood itself may be fine, but in a few years from now all those nails will be nothing but rust and the whole thing will have to be replaced. This is something we learned from contractors who came up who had been down to areas affected by Katrina. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t say what has happened to me is the universal rule for everyone. However, there are empty homes all throughout my end of town. Everyone my family has talked to concerning the way the insurance has been handled have had similar stories. People I&#39;ve talked to who have been affected by Katrina in New Orleans, or Irene in Florida, have reported similar circumstances of being short-changed by the flood insurance program.</p>

(I&#39;ll work on finding a better source for this, since it&#39;s a little buried).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.addictinginfo.org/2013/10/29/hurricane-sandy-one-year-later/">Here</a> is one of the few places I&#39;ve seen actually discussing people getting short-changed by their insurance. As far as I know, no one has actually collected any statistics on this.</p>

<p>The Press of Atlantic City reported that the NJ Department of Community Affairs is investigating the distribution of Sandy funds, but I can&#39;t find the article, since the press of AC has a paygate.</p>

<p>This is a people problem, not a white people problem. And I feel for the NO residents, as well as Florida residents. From what people in both areas have told me, this is a systematic response to natural disasters, with the same things happening in other flooded areas of the country. The flood insurance program doesn&#39;t save homes. It allows banks to quickly recover the capital of their mortgages. </p>
