<p>Do you think it might be beneficial to create a trove of documents and articles that support the various claims that we are making? (similar to this, and similar to the fluoride one)</p>

<p>This may be beneficial to lurkers and newbies, as they would have all the info conveniently presented for them to click and read and make their own judgement. In turn this would hopefully eliminate or discourage the frivolous discourse and confusion that the conspirtards and shills often bring to this subreddit.</p>

<p>I think it would be beneficial if we would vote on the best links, and information to put in these troves. By having these on hand, whenever someone posts sensationalist/fear-mongering/bs links or discussion. Boom. Here you go. </p>

<p>What do you all think? </p>

<p>Btw, I Lol&#39;d at the whole doing the sub a solid. (Rodman)</p>

<p>Yes they are. The fluoride and vaccines have done their job. People have been so poisoned that most of them barely qualify as conscious anymore. Try presenting people with a novel situation, they freak out. The reactions of most adults now are similar to dogs, no real concious mentation, just reaction to stimuli.</p>

<p>Unless that was the most logical place to put it. I&#39;ll refrain from making any judgements regarding your comprehension of such concepts based on perhaps three comments posted on the internet, and would appreciate it if you would do the same- otherwise conclusions drawn will likely be subject to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias">sampling bias.</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, you shouldn&#39;t have directed your second comment at it either</p>

<p>You asked a question regarding my motivations and I elucidated them. Would you prefer I had ignored it?</p>

<p>You&#39;ll forgive me if I don&#39;t defer to your judgements on such matters. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s not to say I&#39;m better than anyone...just more correct than most.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve of coursed reached such a conclusion based on statistical analysis of your decision making compared to a control group right?</p>

<p>Otherwise, you might be falling prey to confirmation bias. I posted a link up-thread regarding it when someone made a similar claim that failed to take it into account so that others could see it and take note. You should check it out. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen them laying down these chemtrails with my own two eyes. I&#39;ve watched the way they intersect and evenly space themselves apart into a giant grid. I&#39;ve literally sat and watched as they fly by overhead opening and closing the valve on those things to form a neatly laid out pattern. I&#39;ve witnessed those same lines in the sky persist overnight and dissipate the next day into a slight haze making the mountains in the near distance barely visible while the sun shines with an overwhelming glare. Don&#39;t tell me there&#39;s no empirical evidence. The longer people like you sit on their thumbs with this the worse the recovery will be for ALL of us. Stop giving these crooks the benefit of the doubt when they did nothing to earn it and everything possible to lose your respect. It&#39;s just pathetic at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude these are NOT clouds, they are TRAILS that come from PLANES.</p>

<p>I have seen planes flying in the sky for my whole life ( I am 24 ), and when they pass over they leave a contrail which dissipates not too long after it passes, which gives it the appearance of having a long &quot;tail&quot;.</p>

<p>I have seen on many occasions the trails of heavy fuel propelled devices such as rocket propelled aircraft, and they leave a trail which lingers for longer in the sky due to the chemicals being burned and their resulting emissions spewing out into the sky which obviously creates the trail.</p>

<p>Since I have become aware of their presence and appearance, I have started to notice CHEMTRAILING, where in these trails are left in criss-cross patterns that just linger in the sky for what seems like forever as they slowly dissipate outwards and drift slowly downwards.</p>

<p>There is a clear difference between all three of these, and chemtrails are most definitely proven through photographic evidence.</p>

<p>&quot;Chemtards are the worst. Every point you bring up, they shoot down with something so stupid and far fetched that its impossible to not end up arguing with them.&quot;</p>

<p>Every single time you reference people from conspiracy it&#39;s some form of insult.</p>

<p>You claim to hold an FAA license, playing the &quot;I have the authority on this subject because of this certification&quot; card, which doesn&#39;t actually mean anything, especially when you refuse to show proof.</p>

<p>&quot;Why should I show you proof of my license?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you&#39;re a fucking liar and none of us believe your clearly lying ass.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t show a picture with the sensitive information redacted?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t take a picture of you holding it up with a piece of paper that says &quot;Hi reddit, 91827 here&quot; with all the sensitive info blacked out ( your face, info on the license, etc. )?</p>

<p>All in all, your entire purpose of being in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> seems to be the absolute destruction of anything that even considers chemtrails to be a reality, which they most certainly are in many forms.</p>

<p>You literally can not deny chemtrails as I&#39;ve stated earlier, these activities are done daily all over the globe be it spraying chemicals on to crops, spraying particulate matter into the sky for Geo-engineering, and the proven secret government projects that sprayed chemicals on completely unsuspecting populations of people such as in St. Louis.</p>

<p>Why are you also unable to post any link which clearly demonstrates through reputable scientific evidence as to how all of these things you claim to be &quot;mistaken contrails&quot; are just that, and not chemtrails of some sort?</p>

<p>Mind you, a chemtrail is any trail left by a plane which is a purposeful emission of chemicals for multiple various purposes.</p>

<p>Most of the lingering lines in the sky are not chemtrails, because you mostly can&#39;t see the chemtrails as they&#39;re spraying such microscopic particulate matter.</p>

<p>The real evidence of that are planes who are spraying very thin mists that don&#39;t leave long trails of anything, as those are more than likely the aerosol spraying planes, especially when the spray is observed coming from the location on the plane where these devices are known to be installed.</p>

<p>Yes they are. The fluoride and vaccines have done their job. People have been so poisoned that most of them barely qualify as conscious anymore. Try presenting people with a novel situation, they freak out. The reactions of most adults now are similar to dogs, no real concious mentation, just reaction to stimuli.</p>
