<li>Causation != Correlation, as well as coincidences do happen</li>
<li>A scientist/elected official saying something doesn&#39;t mean its completely true, as they can be false and/or bias</li>
<li>Off of 2, not all sources are reliable. But pick the ones that a can be backed up by credible sources, not certain fanatics</li>

<p>It also has to do with context.  So many here think that by reading one infowars article about how Syria is all just a big inside job, they are all of a sudden just as informed as people actually watching the conflict.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Umm... The NSA. </p>

<p>In the 90s people were diagnosed with personality disorders for acknowledging such taboo information.</p>

<p>My abormal psych professor mentioned, &quot;people that believe all these branches of government are connected and secretly trying to poison and take advantage of us are delusional and at risk for borderline personality disorder.&quot; </p>

<p>I mentioned, &quot; well before Snowden, you might&#39;ve been supported, but now the NSA and its spying is a matter of public record.&quot;</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t matter. My prof wanted to be ignorant and leftist. Every prof does. Bottom line, let people think whatever they&#39;d like. They&#39;ll end like looking stupid sooner or later.</p>
