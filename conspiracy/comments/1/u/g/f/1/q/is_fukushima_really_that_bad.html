Listening to people like James Corbett who actually live in Japan relatively close to the reactor, I have very little reason to believe that there is a threat to people on the west coast for radiation poisoning. Does anyone have other information to prove that there is an actual threat, besides alarmist naturalnews.com articles?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read a good deal as well and struggle with deciphering just what is happening and how bad is it. Always consider the source of the &#39;news&#39; to properly position their bias. Obviously TEPCO cannot be trusted, regardless of the severity they will never admit to the reality of the situation. TEPCO is a for-profit business and bad news is bad for business. For instance we know TEPCO lied about when the first meltdown occurred. TEPCO also controls the site so independent nuclear experts cannot just stroll up and investigate to find out what is happening. The Japanese Gov&#39;t cannot be trusted for they have a vested interest in keeping civil order and not to pay out millions/billions for disaster relief. So in a nutshell MSM is going to consistently downplay the potential affects.</p>

<p>On the flipside the alternative media(AM) is just as guilty as MSM in using sensationalism to drive traffic. Fukushima, in particular nuclear radiation, is still very much a &#39;hot/explosive&#39; topic (no pun intended) and we know we&#39;re not getting the straight dope from TEPCO/Japan Gov&#39;t. These two facts alone make it painfully easy to go &#39;over the top&#39; when reporting on Fukushima.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at what we do know. Fukushima has 6 reactors. Take a look a pics of the site.  Especially 3. That is a catastrophic failure. 1,2,3 reactors all had explosions and were all operating at the time of the tsunami. Reactors 4,5,6 were all inactive at the time of the tsunami but unit 4, which contained spent fuel rods, had a significant explosion as well. Units 1,2,3 are all confirmed meltdowns. That is bad. What we don&#39;t know and what is simply to dangerous to check is what is happening underneath units 1,2,3. There is a underground river beneath Fukushima, which is used by the plant to cool the reactors, and flows into the Pacific. We know radiated water is leaking from the reactors and flowing out to sea. But how much? We know the weather patterns at Fukushima move the air and the ocean currents East across the Pacific and to the West coast of the US.</p>

<p>I believe at this point, and have for the past 3-4 months, that the Fukushima situation is very bad. What I am not sure of is just how much damage is being done to the environment. A big part of the problem is one can&#39;t usually see, taste, or smell radiation. It is difficult to connect what is happening in Japan with the West Coast, you look at a map and think can Fukushima affect California that is 5000+ miles away? And yet there have been troubling reports of health issues with wildlife (starfish, bald eagles, seals, salmon) on the West Coast. Are these unusual or anomalies? Did you know that servicemen and women from the USS Ronald Reagen are attempting to sue TEPCO for radiation poisoning. The ship was stationed just off the coast at Fukushima the day after the tsunami.</p>

<p>I deliberately did not put in links. Do your own &#39;net research. Consider the sources. Come to your own conclusions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but the DU from our artillery comes into direct contact with the population and is more concentrated that the stuff that is coming from fukashima.  Doesn&#39;t make it any better, just that the effects will be harder to trace directly back to tepco, and there won&#39;t be a mass human die off from it over a span of days or months.  But over years, it could have an enormous impact on pacific rim inhabitants.  I am sure people who get thyroid cancer and die over the next epoch will not think it&#39;s a small problem.  And I am not trying to down play the issue, I am just pointing out that it won&#39;t be a sudden mega death scenario.  Still borns, 100% cancer rates, and Chernobyl Esque deformities are no laughing matter, or things that should be made light of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not all that threatening (that&#39;s not to say its not bad) to the environment for two reasons.</p>

<p>First, scale: Lets assume Fukishima has lost 1,000,000 Gallons of irradiated (hot) water into the Pacific ocean. The volume of earths oceans is roughly 326,000,000,000,000,000,000 gallons (326 million trillion gallons and water circulates across all of the oceans, to act as a global heat distribution system). 1M gallons is literally nothing, nada, zilch, in comparison (less than one trillionth of a percent).</p>

<p>Second: Sea Water is already highly radioactive. The average radioactivity of seawater is about 14 Bq/L of which 88% is from naturally occurring potassium-40 (K-40). About 7% is from anthropogenic fallout from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing and nuclear accidents like Chernobyl (1986) and Fukushima Daiichi (2011).</p>

<p>So combining every human nuclear disaster (All of them, most being responsible for orders of magnitude more radioactive particle dispersal than Fukushima) still only accounts for 7% of Radioactive isotopes in solution.</p>

<p>It basically boils down to the fact that most people fear radioactivity without knowing anything of value about it.  We fear what we do not understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for sharing your intuition, I guess?</p>

<p>I suppose it&#39;s possible we have differing definitions of very little.</p>

<p>To quote part of the paper I posted: </p>

<p>&quot;
Our results are relatively consistent with an estimate of the
local health effects from Fukushima. von Hippel [2011] estimated
that 1 million people live in areas with more than 1 curie per km2
deposition of Cs-137, and that people living in these areas were
subject to a 0.1% increase in cancer risk, resulting in 1000 excess
cancers.</p>

<p>..</p>

<p>A study by the Institut de Radioprotection et de Suret ^ e Nucleaire
(IRSN) estimated a population of 21 100 receiving &gt;16 mSv,
3100 receiving &gt;50 mSv, and 2200 receiving 100–500 mSv near
Fukushima.75 Assuming a LNT model where an exposure of
100 mSv increases lifetime cancer risk by 1%,29 the collective
exposure estimated by IRSN is projected to result in 70–250
excess cancers depending on the precise amount of radiation
received by each grouping. Our estimate of180 excess cancers is
within this range.</p>

<p>&quot;</p>

<p>To clarify my view: </p>

<p>Was there a screw up in the design and management? Sure</p>

<p>Was there a screw up in the disaster response and clean up? Sure</p>

<p>Is this an environmental disaster? Sure, but a rather small one</p>

<p>Will there be any significant number of West coast deaths due to radiation, or eating fish from the Pacific? Probably not. </p>

<p>Is this viral marketing from our corporate overlords for the new Fallout game brought to reality, and will the world as we know it end? Probably not. </p>
