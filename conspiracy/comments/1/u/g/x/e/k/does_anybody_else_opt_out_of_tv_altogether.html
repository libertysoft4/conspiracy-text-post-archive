One way you could prove your point is to actively bring up these topics such as drone strikes killing innocent people to everyone you meet.  And note their reactions.

<p>Considering the corporate media has been hemorraging viewers for the past several years, I&#39;d say the obviousness of your assertion is in doubt.</p>

<p>As an example, <a href="http://newsbusters.org/blogs/randy-hall/2013/08/22/msnbc-still-freefall-loses-22-percent-viewers-last-summer">MSNBC recently lost 22% of it&#39;s viewers</a>, so perhaps people are getting tired of the infotainment that passes for news these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree to that point. People are watching &quot;news&quot; channels less and less because they can skip the fluff and find the story directly online. It still doesn&#39;t change the fact that they are not choosing stories based on importance or anything having to do with journalism but instead ratings.</p>

<p>Notice every time there is a plane crash, for months after anytime a plane has landing gear issues the networks go to live coverage hoping to get film of the crash.</p>

<p>That is not an established fact, especially in light of the recent update to the Smith Mundt Act, which allows the federal government to direct its propaganda at US citizens.  </p>

<p>The level of government collusion in the corporate media since 9/11/2001 has been absolutely off the charts, and, as such, it is no longer only about ratings.  It definitely appears to be about distraction and crisis management.</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s just your body releasing lactic acid. </p>

<p>To test it, just sit down and stare at a light (preferably with a lampshade) and clear your mind. Don&#39;t think of stupid it is or how much you have to do tomorrow, just zone out. Feeling tired?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they are stupid and believing with the TV-induced illusion of being smart and informed. Have you ever had a &quot;conversation&quot; with a FOX News watcher? They will repeat concepts and thoughts given to them through the box and hold them as their own original thought. It&#39;s incredible. They never realize that they are just believing and repeating what they are told. I assume the same thing is happening now with the MSNBC crowd as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stopped watching TV in 1990 and have only gained from the loss. Living to be passively entertainmed is not living a life. Without an instant distraction box I was able to explore so much of myself and the world since that was my only option. Now with the internet there is no need to have a TV to keep informed and as we all know, the MSM&#39;s job is to keep us misinformed and distracted. The only reason now I keep a TV set is to movies at home which is OK by me since my viewing time is specific, targeted and guaranteed to have an end point. Keep the TV and unplug the cable/antenna is always my advice. </p>

I was greatly amused when my dentist found out I didn&#39;t watch tv and went on to lecture me about the wonders of television as though I came from a different planet and wasn&#39;t already an expert on the topic like everyone else in America.  He said &quot;so if you don&#39;t watch television what do you do then&quot;?  I thought it was a very funny question because it was inconceivable to him that there is a worthwhile existence outside of the mainstream media.  Also, he was filling my tooth at the time so I really couldn&#39;t answer.  But, don&#39;t get me wrong he is a great dentist and human being.  He just has a different view than I do on this topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I am! Reddit has been awesome for me to keep up. Not with the current trends and popular tastes but with the evolving consciousness and the mind-set of the generation after me. It&#39;s been awesome. I have always felt that the younger generation should always be the teachers to the generations that came before them. The youngest among us are the freshest and newest batch of beings who have come to Earth deliver and advance the consciousness of the human race. Why download more bullshit form the generation in front of me-what do they know?-a bunch of hooey pretty much. Reddit has allowed me to interface with a younger mind-set and helped me grow and advance myself by learning how people born in my 20&#39;s see and navigate the world. I just hope this place doesn&#39;t get fucked-up and messed-over by the controlling-elite who like to piss on parties; they probably will. But by that time something else will have evolved to replace it. Always look to those younger than you too teach you and you will  never get old and stuck in &quot;your own&quot; time. Oh...and never watch television. They&#39;re called programs for a reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something else I noticed is how much easier it is to see when &quot;our&quot; news media tells us they are showing reflections of our society, they are often pushing what certain people want us to accept as the norm.  </p>

<p>And the &quot;technical events&quot; in so-called reality programming are really disturbing, maybe even hypnotic to some.  Seldom is a camera angle held for longer than 6 seconds, even shorter for commercials.  Count the seconds between camera changes and you&#39;ll see what I mean.  </p>

<p>I think it leads to the addiction.  People&#39;s real lives don&#39;t move that fast, and they can&#39;t imagine what they would do without that rush.  But if you get away from it for awhile, the next time you get around a tv you can better see how the production values, scripting, acting, camera angles, are all a disgusting facade.</p>

<p>Btw, many of my friends have since unplugged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>8 years now without a television.</p>

<p>Whenever I&#39;m at a hotel or visit a friend, I&#39;m stunned at how disruptive and degenerating it is.</p>

<p>Put this box in the corner of your room - every 10 minutes, it will tell you for a few minutes that you&#39;re inadequate in a passive aggressive way.</p>

<p>Stunning that some people put away 2 or 3 hours of that every night.</p>

<p>But I always remember what Steve Jobs said:</p>

<p>“When you’re young, you look at television and think, There’s a
conspiracy. The networks have conspired to dumb us down. But
when you get a little older, you realize that’s not true. The networks
are in business to give people exactly what they want. That’s a far
more depressing thought. Conspiracy is optimistic! You can shoot
the bastards! We can have a revolution! But the networks are really
in business to give people what they want.”</p>

<p>That&#39;s why the idea of something like The Matrix, Communism, Big Brother surveillance, etc whatever are more possible to be accepted than many people realise.</p>

<p>It&#39;s sad and a little frightening.</p>

<p>*Edit: I&#39;m not saying there are no conspiracies, there clearly are.  However, some things we&#39;re simply doing to ourselves.  We&#39;re remarkably good at enslaving ourselves.</p>

<p>“When you’re young, you look at television and think, There’s a conspiracy. The networks have conspired to dumb us down. But when you get a little older, you realize that’s not true. The networks are in business to give people exactly what they want. That’s a far more depressing thought. Conspiracy is optimistic! You can shoot the bastards! We can have a revolution!

<p>No more network or cable news either.  They&#39;re only there to do some  specific things; make themselves money, tell you what the government wants you to believe,  keep you pacified, your butt on the couch and uninvolved politically, and make you think that you&#39;re always part of the other 50% of public opinion.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t owned a t.v. in at least about 5 years.  People joke about how it&#39;s pretentious or whatever to mention you don&#39;t own a t.v., but as long as you&#39;re not a pretentious douche about it, I think it&#39;s obvious how terrible mindlessly watching t.v. is, you can&#39;t choose, the programming, only the channel and you get innundated with fucking endless advertisements that take up almost as much of the broadcasting as the actual content.</p>

<p>And yea, mainstream news channels are unbelievable.  Whenever I catch a glimpse of one in a lobby or by a house or whatever, it&#39;s mind blowing to me to think that millions of people watch that garbage.</p>

I get all my shows for free and for my regular T.V I have that stupid thing you put on top of it, I get all the major channels like nbc, abc, cbs etc.. a few movie channels and more. It&#39;s all free, here where I live they made the state and everyone with a T.V change and buy these boxes we have to use when they went to broadcast instead of antenna. They were like $30 but they payed for $10 or something, big deal. I believe the whole U.S had to do this if I&#39;m not mistaken. Screw paying close to $100 a month for T.V AND internet, I save like $60 a month doing this, my internet is like $55 a month.</p>

<p>As far as TV for <em>information</em>? I haven&#39;t used it for that for years, since TV &quot;news&quot; is totally useless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s important to pay attention to the media only because you know what they want you to pay attention to. Once you know that, you can diverge from the narrative.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also important to watch because you know, there&#39;s just some things you want to stay relevant for among your peers.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is that TV can be fun, excellent examples of human creativity and sometimes it&#39;s just putting the pussy on the chain wax.</p>
