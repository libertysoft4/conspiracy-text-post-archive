But these posts with hour long videos of Shamans, Druids and other charlatans, giving each other PhD&#39;s, talking about how they took some hallucinogenic drug and they saw god.</p>

<p>Is this the last thing that the system has come up with? Divert people from basic and simple truth, like the fucking central banks or the megacorporations, the military lobbies, fucking Rupert Murdoch?</p>

<p>Oh look the fucking illuminati are Satan worshippers, they use black magic. That&#39;s how they get their power. We need the Messiah to come and deliver us. Well keep waiting guys. It&#39;s been 2 millennia you&#39;re waiting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a big difference between spiritism and spirituality. I see spirituality in science, in music, in paintings, in sculpture, in literature, in dance,...</p>

<p>Of course we want to be more than animals, we want to give a meaning, we need to, or we sink in the most obvious ambient nihilism.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that eating some hallucinogen will bring me closer to god and the Truth, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s spirituality. I think it&#39;s just my own brain being completely disoriented and trying to find something to lean on, may it be a dream, a wish, some memory in the past, some stuff that I was told so many times that I have built an image of it in my brain. I think that its good if you try to know yourself, your fantasies, your dreams, your unconsciousness, but in no case, will it bring me Truth.</p>

<p>The brain is so complex, I don&#39;t think that a bunch of charlatans on drugs will have the answer to its functioning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you want to simplify it like that, then any material thing is to me a chemical interaction in my brain. </p>

<p>Edit: Spirituality is, to make it simple, the pursuit of the sacred. You search around you to find what is sacred, what is worth living for, what has more importance than your own life to yourself. Spiritism is believing in ghosts, spooks, witches, black magic, santaclaus, the fairy mermaid, etc.</p>

<p>Im just being curious, and i want to ask this respectfully:</p>

<p>Have you ever injested any hallucinogen/psychedelic?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is important. I used to think the same thing, and while I still am not spiritual or religious, the first time I did a powerful hallucinogen I suddenly understood what everyone meant when they talked about seeing god and sprituality. It no longer sounded like nonsense. It can be a very convincing experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It truely can be convincing. I agree. </p>

<p>Personally, id label myself as spiritual but not religious. Psychedelics have played a role in that, but it is important to note that i have also come to this stance in life because of other reasons. Often times you can achieve similar effects by meditating intently for a period if time. This had led me into research on the pineal gland and its alledged connection with the &quot;third eye.&quot; </p>

<p>Its interesting to hear what what historical individuals say about this exact topic, such as the buddha, or dahli lama (sp?). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a simple question. I didnt think it would be too hard to answer it. Im honestly curious, as those who have never tried it &quot;tend&quot; to be the most vocal against it. </p>

<p>But, ill humor your response by saying, no, i have never eaten the heart of a warrior. Nor do i subscribe to that belief in particular. But that isnt the same thing, per se, as the chemical interactions of psychedlic molecules are different than the molecules contained in the heart. </p>

<p>Although, i admit, there are similarities in the two suggestions, and that is, one believes thst by injesting this, you gain that. Thats as far as the similarites go, though.</p>

<p>But like i said, its not a hsrd question. Have you ever injested a hallucinogen/psychedelic?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Things are not as bad as you make them. Ninety percent of the content posted here <strong>does</strong> relate to the &quot;basic and simple truth&quot; items you listed.</p>

<p>Lobbies? Multi-national corporations? Central banking? Come on, dude. That shit is a <em>drum beat</em> around here. Btw, the fact you think occult/satan considerations should be filed under fantasy exposes your ignorance a bit. On another quick note, we&#39;ve had <em>enough</em> of the chit-chatter posts about &quot;what this sub is&quot; and &quot;what it should be&quot; to last us fucking years. Mod interference and posts like this distract from what should be discussed here: Anything that relates to conspiracies, on <em>any</em> level. BTW, if you really think about it, how does a fiat-based monetary system (central banking) and/or global corporate influence on national governments really belong to <em>conspiracy</em> in the first place? I find that stuff to be <em>obvious</em> knowledge, with no real conspiracy there. It&#39;s not my fault people who don&#39;t get QE all of a sudden think it&#39;s a conspiracy when the light bulb finally goes on for them.. Looks like some of your crabby flakes got into my bowl this morning. It&#39;s also -55 wind chill outside, so who knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is that they want us to believe that they believe in this shit. By us, I mean people who despise them like you and I, and people who admire them, like the lower levels of their pyramids. They want you and I to believe it, so we fear them and their black magic power, they want their own to believe to attract them and keep them under dominance. The dream of finding something supernatural, must be worth selling the world for.</p>

<p>See? Even if they did believe in it, in what point would it matter? Is it worse than any other religion or racist doctrine? They have pedo rituals, with human sacs, and blood and shit. Ok. Is it worse than the millions of people they starve to death throughout the world? Let&#39;s say it&#39;s worse. Will our understanding of their ritual help us to bring them down?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how this shit is even constructive.</p>

<p>Not everything on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is meant to be &quot;constructive&quot;. </p>

<p>Sometimes people post fun conspiracies, like on the level of bigfoot and lochness. It was really common here a few years ago, now with real conspiracies coming out into the open, we&#39;re seeing way more political content and way less &quot;fun&quot; content, and all the people who are new to the subreddit and see like 9 political posts, then 1 stupid post get butthurt about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, true. But you missed my point i think.</p>

<p>I was trying to say that whether you believe in this stuff or not, doesnt affect whether TPTB believe in it. And, if TPTB believe in it, and its their motivation/justification for their atrocities, then it doesnt matter if you personally believe it or not, or even if its true or not. </p>

<p>There have been plenty of examples of delusionary motives/justifications for unjust/inhumane/illegal acts. There is nothing to bar TPTB to follow suite in this sort of behavior in regards to what your beliefs may be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read somewhere that second world war was about mass murder and execution, because the leader believed that Ba&#39;al was requesting innocent blood and stuff. Although what you mean may not be exactly this, I am sure that it&#39;s somehow close to this logic.</p>

<p>The other way to put it was that in the early 20th century, socialism, communism and anarchism were spreading in Europe at an enormous rate. This was mainly caused by the industrialisation and the heavy capitalisation, people would see that the owner of the companies would just have to put some money and get 80% of the benefits where the workers would do all the job and get scraps. Also, people started to realise that they could afford all their basic needs without the bourgeois and the elite, and still have access to knowledge to make their life better. Anyway, the industrialisation unemployed a lot of people, people started gathering, talking, finding alternative ways to survive, create syndicates, start riots, etc. To release the pressure of this mass, the elite asked the bourgeois bankers to lend them money and make a big fucking war through the whole continent by tickling that same old nerve : nationalism. With destruction of people and goods, the people left would be happy to be alive, hateful of the strangers and therefore trustful to their state, reconstruction would create jobs, diminish the gatherings of the unemployed and also create debt which is a win for the bankers.</p>

<p>But Russia fell from the inside, and the new USSR was a lighthouse (as crooked as it could be) for socialism which continued to spread across the continent and even in the US. Boom ww2 with the same preperations, the same nations in war, the same bankers loaning money, the sons of the martyrs becoming martyrs, etc.</p>

<p>Gain power over people. Sometimes, it&#39;s as simple as that. It has been that way since the civilisation of Sumer. Gain power over your brother, over your neighbour, over the lion, over the snakes, over the mountain, over the see. It&#39;s the animal instinct in human nature to try and gain power. But if we consider ourselves higher than the rest of the animal kingdom, it&#39;s in our conciousness of this principle, this weakness, this flaw in our way of living together.</p>

<p>But you know, it&#39;s much more fascinating to believe that Ba&#39;al requests virgin blood. I&#39;d definitely open a beer and watch that show on TV again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow great response. And ill admit, i do agree with what i think you are trying to say.</p>

<p>The lust for power is certainly key in world events. And, as you described so elegantly, it often provides a much more plausible MO. </p>

<p>As much as i agree, i still support the inclusion of these topics in this sub. I like to investigate alternative explanations, and even if they are less plausible, i believe there is still more to it than what meets the eye. Ill reference religion here.</p>

<p>(Ill admit, i am not religious and this may be a case of bias, and i mean no disrespect to those who are religious) but i often felt like religion itself (at least organized religion) is a bit of a conspiracy. So many wars were fought in the name of a god. Even the sumerians you spoke of had their own beliefs (interesting stuff, btw, with the annunaki and whatnot) I have always thought that power and control were the underlying reasons for organized religion. Whether or not those at the top believed in it, or falsified it all for the masses to believe in and become enslaved to the ideas, power and control are definately fundamental in human nature.</p>

<p>But, i still dont see the need to discredit or nullify what, if any, influence the occult, spiritual, or mystical beliefs have on the quest for power and control.</p>

<p>I feel it is possible for the truth to lay somewhere in between.</p>

Whats even more amusing is that you think because I&#39;m arguing with you about name-calling, I support the Israeli state... In fact I&#39;ve been a staunch advocate for its dissolution since I was 14, but sure I must be a Zionist because I&#39;m not a conspiratard.

    <div class="md"><p>The best, science can give you is a falsifiable theory - proof is something that mathematics can do.
If we talk about conspiracies - or theories thereof, we&#39;re touching neither of those, but talking politics and law, e.g. pseudoscience in most cases and common sense at best, sadly.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of Operation Paperclip? The Nazi scientists of the Kammlerstab literally based their physics on ancient texts of the Egyptians, Sumerians, and Aryans. Going off of Tesla&#39;s original (and hidden) work on Earth&#39;s resonance, they developed his ideas into a scientific theory that unifies Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. The theory is called Unified Field Theory and you can check it out here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrcWntw9juM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrcWntw9juM</a></p>

<p>Unified Field Theory has already made anti-gravity possible. Anti-gravity technology is used in military aircraft such as the TR-3b. Video of the TR-3b here: <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=08b_1362520923">http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=08b_1362520923</a> . In fact, most &quot;UFO&quot; sightings are thought to be TR-3b and similar aircraft test runs.

    <div class="md"><p>hint: it&#39;s a wild goose chase - as long as one knows nothing about advanced physics, it all sounds totally awesome, the more you really learn about the stuff, the more appaling this woo becomes.</p>
