For thousands of years religion did this quite successfully and still does in many parts of the world but the speed in which people are turning away from religion nowadays has increased exponentially. Without this form of control in peoples lives to insure that they are being &quot;good citizens&quot; this is where the government steps in to assume that power and let everyone know that with religion or not they&#39;re being watched and better be &quot;good citizens&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My religion frees me from the state. That&#39;s what it teaches me, non-violent resistence. It doesn&#39;t teach me to &quot;obey the state&quot;, or anyone else. It teaches me that when I go protesting and the gendarmes threaten me with violence, I should stand my ground without resorting to violence myself. It teaches me that powerful men will stop at nothing until we&#39;re all tagged and through the government, they will know everything we do. If anything, my religion has made me more anti-system than anything else. I&#39;m orthodox Christian by the way, one of the &quot;blind sheeple&quot; around here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Without religion is not the same as godless.  Over Thanksgiving one family member who is atheist tried to sneak me into his hard line camp with an argument of <em>&quot;well which one is more likely&quot;</em> to imply that a 51% (maybe 66%) more likely choice that there is no god implies that there cannot be one.  I took exception to this definition and another family member went on my side.  Then next we were looking up the exact definitions.</p>

<p>Apparently I am actually agnostic as defined by the word and I held my line on that one.  The hard line atheists seem to like to swell their ranks.  Just look at the difference between the subscribership of <a href="/r/agnosticism">/r/agnosticism</a> and <a href="/r/atheism">/r/atheism</a>.  I&#39;m basically agnostic and I could really give a shit about talking about that all day.  I have more freedom to explore ideas and I also don&#39;t have to beat myself up if I feel one way or another at a moment.  If there is a god is it more like a wave or a particle?  Whatever.  The answer doesn&#39;t really change anything for me even if the question doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe god to be kind of a guiding intelligent force that shapes existence. I think it transcends time and space. I kind of see it in terms of the whole hermetic &quot;conscious universe&quot; type of thing. I don&#39;t see the boundary between science and TRUE religion, true religion being the truth of existence, not dogmatic interpretations. Like Einstein said, something along the lines of &quot;Science is simply understanding the mind of God&quot;. The more we learn from science, the more it makes me realize that there is an incredibly unique, harmonious and perfect order in the universe. I guess I kind of think of god like a metaphor for the intelligent force guiding and shaping the universe, when it&#39;s all said and done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people take it too literally. It has some good ideas in there, but I think a large part of the Old Testament is, in my opinion, meant to be taken allegorically/metaphorically. I think that of all of the old scriptures, the ones that actually resonate with me would be the Gnostic Gospels of the Nag Hammadi library, which were only discovered in 1945. They humanize Jesus, instead of placing him on a pedestal of idolatry. The teachings of Jesus in the Gnostic Gospels are incredibly interesting. It&#39;s no wonder why they had to be buried/hidden...the Roman authorities wanted to cherry pick the teachings to control people&#39;s perspective of their state religion, and keep them subservient... Like a modern day book burning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe the creator thinks things out. In my philosophy classes I was taught that god would be considered the greatest conceivable intelligence, far faster than quantum computers and the speed of light. I think that it&#39;s largely about instant harmony and adaption/evolution. As a conscious energy, god may be omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent. This applies to more than our observable universe. Given that, and as I said this concept transcends time and space...this conscious existence already knows the future...hell, it IS the future, because it&#39;s eternal and infinite. We as humans cannot grasp this because we were born imperfect and limited in our perspective.  Hell, take a look at the tiny portion of the visible light spectrum we have access to, and realize that&#39;s only light. We are talking about the infinite and eternal here, light is only a small part, and we cannot even comprehend the full spectrum of THAT. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t approve of the UN.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>told us that to accept the new world order they have to destroy three basic pillars that keep the population grounded</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the enemy would cast asunder, the hero must desire to protect the <del>MacGuffin</del> pillars of society, but what are they?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The pillars are 1. family bounds, 2. nationalism and 3. religion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let us set aside for a moment the assertion that the UN is organized enough to have their own <del>Satanic</del> ideology and instead simply assert that the combination of words leading up to this point suggest that you value these three &quot;pillars&quot; and worry they are threatened by mysterious international forces. Have I lost the thread of you narrative yet?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ask which nations are in favor of this pillars and which nations are detroying them on purpose and you will know the sides of the global war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I sure don&#39;t see any Western European countries fighting for traditional family, nationalism or <del>bronze age woo</del> religion. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which countries are destroying the familily with gay rights, gender studies, agitation between men and woman and much more?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hell, at this point, even gun-toting, Bible-thumping America looks like it has fallen on the so called wrong side, between gay marriage, equal rights for women in the workplace &quot;and much more&quot;! Do you remember when <em>those people</em> knew their place? Pepperidge Farms remembers!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which are the countries that are not protecting their countries from foreign influences?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could go Google you up such an impressive list of acronyms like NAFTA, but I&#39;d rather ask you to make me a list of countries protecting themselves from foreign influence. It&#39;s not that the suggestion is wildly unfamiliar, it&#39;s just that I am accustomed to hearing that sort of talk out of Arab governments seeking to thwart western intervention in their attempts to beat, gas and bomb their populations back into a more obedient mindset. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which countries are opposed to religion and whose population is mocking every religion but have cultural events full of satanic symbols and rituals. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hrmmm, that sounds like a jab at Hollywood and the good, ol&#39; US of A. Let&#39;s contrast life in America with life in some more devout places like Calcutta or Benghazi or Kashmir. How&#39;s life going under the grace of god? or did you have some other, specific god in mind?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There might be people out there that think destroying the family bounds is a great idea, but really I am not one of them. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right, let&#39;s bring marriage back to its roots, an exchange of property as described in the Bible. I don&#39;t think they put the same one man and <strong><em>one</em></strong> woman cap on things though...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is obvious to me that Putin is acting diametrically opposed to everything the USA or the EU does. How do you explain that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Putin is the head of a former super power hoping to claw its way back into relevancy on the strength of natural gas and an aging nuclear stockpile. I explain it in that international relations is game with a finite pool of victorious circumstances, which is to say that the more good one country controls, the less good is left on the table for the other countries. I certainly don&#39;t need to fall back on sky wizards and hidden demons. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe because he wants opposed poles sharing the power of the world and is opposed to the globalist dream of the one world order?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vladimir Putin would sit the thrown if he knew where it was and how to get there. So would every other elected politician serving in office in a wealthy country today, I think. I don&#39;t need Illuminati cabals to explain that this is how the game of thrones is played. You cling to the comforting notion that the enemy is known and therefore can be exposed and defeated and the good can finally get back to the way things were before the cancerous evil, but when? When, exactly, was this golden age of peace and free thought? The real world has a hundred hundred viscous, bloodthirsty dictators waiting for the right opportunity, silently biding their time and doing their part at their level. The enemy is not some otherworldly devil or attainted cabal, but the very fact and frailty of human nature. We are the sum total of our many possibilities, each one of us every hero and every monster. By shifting the blame to metaphysical dichotomies, you excuse yourself the responsibility to make the world a better place. </p>

<p>No, I do not approve of the expansion of the Anglo-American, psychopathic establishment, through central organizations that they control, called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA058B7S-Xk">UN</a>. WHO, WTO, IPCC and <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2004/11/9/confessions_of_an_economic_hit_man">IMF</a> are nonfunctioning, corrupted bodies of global control that do not serve the purpose they claim to have. That alone should raise eyebrows, even not knowing  their history as successor of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcjAOqmRcs0">CFR</a>, the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPmZm-zs-k">League of Nations</a> or the research of <a href="http://www.newsofinterest.tv/video_pages_flash/politics/misc_neocon_globalist/caroll_quigley_trag_hope.php">Carrol Quigley</a>. If the Rockefellers that sponsored the UN building are not luziferian then it must be a rather odd coincidence that they have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucis_Trust">Lucis trust</a>. I do not believe in imposing bad things for the greater good, because that way you can force the most destructive and violent agendas down the throats of the gullible. They want a one world religion and that religion is based in the occult. They act as if they are opposed to religions and that they want a brighter future. But they are devaluating and attacking Christianity, Judaism, Islam and every other religion that is not based <a href="http://www.fourwinds10.net/siterun_data/religion_cults/news.php?q=1249755048">in the occult</a>. Femen did not even realize that they are just pawns of the UN agenda when they run into churches.
I think their destructive agenda is well known by now and I can not be ignorant about it.</p>

<p>I am myself an atheist, but I consider religions to be of philosophical value and they provide help and keep people grounded. Some humans need them, they represent the individuality of people and should not be forbidden or be controlled by the state. There are two examples from last century where they forbade religions in a state and it went miserably wrong (social-nationalistic Germany and communistic UDSSR). The UN should better not tamper with religions and not try to force the clash of civilizations to discredit every religion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but I&#39;d rather ask you to make me a list of countries protecting themselves from foreign influence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps you are not paying attention. They try to protect themselves and I think you do not understand what is going on in Europe. 
All sorts of countries are trying to get out of the grip of the globalists. Some just have to flee under the belt of one of the super powers and Russia is still one and gaining influence and military force by the day. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Austria: President Haider was too nationalistic and had a “car accident”.</p></li>
<li><p>Poland: President too nationalisitic. Plane crash with all the policians.</p></li>
<li><p>Ireland: They forced the EURO and the Treaty of Lisbon on Ireland even when most of the population did not want that. But they voted as often they wanted to get it done.</p></li>
<li><p>Iceland: The only successful little country so far.</p></li>
<li><p>Greece: Too nationalistic, they have thrown out the president and replaced him with a Goldman Sachs minion.</p></li>
<li><p>Czech Republic: Vaclav Klaus was too nationalistic and they forced him out of power and he was also forced to reluctantly sign the Treaty of Lisbon. </p></li>
<li><p>Italy: see Greece and the population hated that Goldman Sachs guy.</p></li>
<li><p>Switzerland: they are tampering with this country even when it is not in the EU.</p></li>
<li><p>Ukraine: First &quot;color revolution&quot;. And the country was heavily propagandized by the EU and they wanted them to sign treaties but now they are back under control of Russia.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I do not know if you are familiar with the call of independence from Scotland and Basque Country. You see some presidents and part of the population know something is rotten in the state of Denmark.</p>

<p>The problem is that none of the countries in Europe have enough military power to oppose the globalist agenda and they can not even protect their population from being spied on by the NSA. So in reality there is only China and Russia left. And for sure there are some countries that claim to be independent and  sovereign nations, but they are instantly attacked like Libya (oil, gold dinar) or Afghanistan (opium, Caspian see gas pipeline) or are not important enough to have a military intervention at the moment (for example Cuba, Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela). And for sure there are some countries that are vilified all the time because they are not licking the boots of the Anglo-American establishment.</p>

The Tower of Babel scripture has fascinated me for years - 9 simple lines that most churchgoing people pay little mind to but really speaks a lot to me about the true nature of the &quot;God&quot; portrayed in those books:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. 2 As people moved eastward,[a] they found a plain in Shinar[b] and settled there.</p>

<p>3 They said to each other, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar. 4 Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.”</p>

<p>5 But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building. 6 The Lord said, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. 7 Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.”</p>

<p>8 So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city. 9 That is why it was called Babel[c]—because there the Lord confused the language of the whole world. From there the Lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Throughout the Old Testament, the depiction of God seems more to me to be in the nature of a lab tech than a beneficent deity.  Multiple times, God will scatter man across the Earth or even extinguish life on a mass scale and &quot;Start Over&quot;.  Like a trial and error pattern.  That doesn&#39;t sound like All-Knowing and All-Powerful to me.    </p>

<p>If God is afraid that man can come together as a collective and accomplish so much, and our government is acting as God, then I believe the solution to our government problem is not a new form of government led by a small group of people.  The solution is a collective, a hive mind that checks itself and is not bound by secretive and corrupt power mongers.    </p>

<p>A true collective is what the NSA&#39;s far-reaching information theft is designed to conquer.  Turn the individual against their neighbor and they will never cohere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people take it too literally. It has some good ideas in there, but I think a large part of the Old Testament is, in my opinion, meant to be taken allegorically/metaphorically. I think that of all of the old scriptures, the ones that actually resonate with me would be the Gnostic Gospels of the Nag Hammadi library, which were only discovered in 1945. They humanize Jesus, instead of placing him on a pedestal of idolatry. The teachings of Jesus in the Gnostic Gospels are incredibly interesting. It&#39;s no wonder why they had to be buried/hidden...the Roman authorities wanted to cherry pick the teachings to control people&#39;s perspective of their state religion, and keep them subservient... Like a modern day book burning.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t approve of the UN.</p>

<p>No, I do not approve of the expansion of the Anglo-American, psychopathic establishment, through central organizations that they control, called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA058B7S-Xk">UN</a>. WHO, WTO, IPCC and <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2004/11/9/confessions_of_an_economic_hit_man">IMF</a> are nonfunctioning, corrupted bodies of global control that do not serve the purpose they claim to have. That alone should raise eyebrows, even not knowing  their history as successor of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcjAOqmRcs0">CFR</a>, the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPmZm-zs-k">League of Nations</a> or the research of <a href="http://www.newsofinterest.tv/video_pages_flash/politics/misc_neocon_globalist/caroll_quigley_trag_hope.php">Carrol Quigley</a>. If the Rockefellers that sponsored the UN building are not luziferian then it must be a rather odd coincidence that they have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucis_Trust">Lucis trust</a>. I do not believe in imposing bad things for the greater good, because that way you can force the most destructive and violent agendas down the throats of the gullible. They want a one world religion and that religion is based in the occult. They act as if they are opposed to religions and that they want a brighter future. But they are devaluating and attacking Christianity, Judaism, Islam and every other religion that is not based <a href="http://www.fourwinds10.net/siterun_data/religion_cults/news.php?q=1249755048">in the occult</a>. Femen did not even realize that they are just pawns of the UN agenda when they run into churches.
I think their destructive agenda is well known by now and I can not be ignorant about it.</p>

<p>I am myself an atheist, but I consider religions to be of philosophical value and they provide help and keep people grounded. Some humans need them, they represent the individuality of people and should not be forbidden or be controlled by the state. There are two examples from last century where they forbade religions in a state and it went miserably wrong (social-nationalistic Germany and communistic UDSSR). The UN should better not tamper with religions and not try to force the clash of civilizations to discredit every religion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but I&#39;d rather ask you to make me a list of countries protecting themselves from foreign influence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps you are not paying attention. They try to protect themselves and I think you do not understand what is going on in Europe. 
All sorts of countries are trying to get out of the grip of the globalists. Some just have to flee under the belt of one of the super powers and Russia is still one and gaining influence and military force by the day. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Austria: President Haider was too nationalistic and had a “car accident”.</p></li>
<li><p>Poland: President too nationalisitic. Plane crash with all the policians.</p></li>
<li><p>Ireland: They forced the EURO and the Treaty of Lisbon on Ireland even when most of the population did not want that. But they voted as often they wanted to get it done.</p></li>
<li><p>Iceland: The only successful little country so far.</p></li>
<li><p>Greece: Too nationalistic, they have thrown out the president and replaced him with a Goldman Sachs minion.</p></li>
<li><p>Czech Republic: Vaclav Klaus was too nationalistic and they forced him out of power and he was also forced to reluctantly sign the Treaty of Lisbon. </p></li>
<li><p>Italy: see Greece and the population hated that Goldman Sachs guy.</p></li>
<li><p>Switzerland: they are tampering with this country even when it is not in the EU.</p></li>
<li><p>Ukraine: First &quot;color revolution&quot;. And the country was heavily propagandized by the EU and they wanted them to sign treaties but now they are back under control of Russia.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I do not know if you are familiar with the call of independence from Scotland and Basque Country. You see some presidents and part of the population know something is rotten in the state of Denmark.</p>

<p>The problem is that none of the countries in Europe have enough military power to oppose the globalist agenda and they can not even protect their population from being spied on by the NSA. So in reality there is only China and Russia left. And for sure there are some countries that claim to be independent and  sovereign nations, but they are instantly attacked like Libya (oil, gold dinar) or Afghanistan (opium, Caspian see gas pipeline) or are not important enough to have a military intervention at the moment (for example Cuba, Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela). And for sure there are some countries that are vilified all the time because they are not licking the boots of the Anglo-American establishment.</p>
