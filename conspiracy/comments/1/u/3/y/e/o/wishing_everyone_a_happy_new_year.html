Even if some Jews exaggerated the number killed and if some had a role in Hitler&#39;s plans a holocaust still took place.

<p>No I&#39;m saying calling someone a Holocaust denier is roughly equivalent to calling someone a cream denier, instead of having a DISCUSSION about what their actual views on the Holocaust are or why they don&#39;t like cream in their coffee.</p>

<p>Its intellectually LAZY to end a discussion by calling people names.  Just because the name you are calling them is crafted out of words that aren&#39;t commonly insulting, the intent is to &quot;label them&quot; as a group of people you find distasteful.  This is only slightly higher effort than just outright calling them a retard, but on the scale of effort it is still VERY LOW effort and not at all a DISCUSSION.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I was just thinking about this over the past few days. It can be very unhelpful when users attempt to enforce the rules in public  (especially those rules which have a certain degree of grey area) and I, personally, would much prefer that these matters be reported to the modmail or via a PM to any of the mods. </p>

<p>When I was on some old phpbb forums back in the day they called it &quot;_____ modding&quot;, I just forget the first word. &quot;Couch modding&quot; maybe? &quot;shadow modding&quot;? Damn it I know I&#39;m close I just can&#39;t remember the exact term for the behavior. </p>

<p>Either way, I would like to possibly see a general rule that prevents users from attempting to enforce the rules in public (as this tends to cause nothing but hostility and degraded discussion), but even your proposed change to rule 1 sounds really good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If accusations of racism are only reported to mods, then it seems it would stand to reason that less community input through discussional involvement happens, thus leaving it all in the mods hands not fully in the open.</p>

<p>I often enjoy reading the open racism, the accusations of racism, &amp; then how the community responds. Sometimes positive change happens. </p>

<p>Example: Sometimes stereotyping stops &amp; direct focus results. A racist statement calling all jews this or that sometimes evolves after group confrontation into &quot;right wing zionists&quot;. or Blaming all African Americans for violence using racial slurs becomes inner city gangs or specific individuals or subset groups of them cause [non exclusive to them] violence. Racism often has realities shuffled under the rug that need discussion, under the rug = often reeks of conspiracy &amp; stereotyping is a common ignorant hot headed mistake that needs to not be quickly banned IMO, but given efforts to educate away. If a green dude has his wife raped by a blue dude, then I expect hot headed ignorance venting to be dealt with &amp; not punished by banning, unless the behavior is done continual &amp; troll like, with non opened to earnest cerebral discussion attitude.</p>

<p>Just sayin... reporting like hall monitors, is like behind the back snitching &amp; could lead to abuse depending on the mods sole opinions.</p>

<p>I am not much of a sports fan, but maybe an open discussion call for strike flair or a mod strike flair system could be used for both. [Mostly just thinking aloud, more so than seriously suggesting.]</p>

<p>None of it makes for much of an issue to me, as I RES tag mark, &amp; I also update my tags in many ways often, to deal with those I find ill.</p>

<p>I do like to learn from all peoples views, if earnestly cerebral, &amp; just wanted to add my fear of non community input to ban hammers.</p>

<p>Thank you for your civil logical reply to me 0_- &amp; your suggestion that has been placed on the sidebar is also a logical one. I am sure if mods get too wacky with the ban hammer upon people whom do not genuinely need it as the majority of the community desire, then the whole community would find out one way or another &amp; raise a fuss.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Thank you to all here &amp; HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!</p>

<p>Keep on questioning &amp; pointing out the BS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I preferred &quot;No racism.&quot; tbh. We can all agree criticising a person for their country of birth or color of their skin is wrong. Religion, creed or doctrine are much greyer areas and should be open for debate. With this rule someone could complain for criticism over being a communist/zionist/nazi/rich and actually have a case...</p>

<p>a) the definition of &#39;slur&#39; is debatable for one thing</p>

<p>b) unnecessarily politically correct</p>

<p>c) opens door for more spurious/bogus reports by jews, zionists &amp; others</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oxford English Dictionary:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/racism?q=racism">Racism</a>: the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/slur?q=slur">Slur</a> an insinuation or allegation about <em>someone</em> that is likely to insult them or damage their reputation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As used in Rule 1, that &quot;someone&quot; is taken to mean all members of a certain &quot;race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, social order or creed&quot;. When &quot;slur&quot; is use in conjunction with &quot;race&quot;, as it is in Rule 1, it has the same effect as &quot;no racism&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>opens door for more spurious/bogus reports by jews, zionists &amp; others</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see a problem with that. Typically any &quot;spurious/bogus&quot; posts like that are factually debunked on a regular basis here and end up being detrimental to the posters own agenda.</p>

<p>I do see your points though. The terms &quot;insult them&quot; and &quot;damage their reputation&quot; used in the definition of &quot;slur&quot; could be taken to extremes and we&#39;ll have to walk a fine line trying not to limit people&#39;s freedom to speak their beliefs. The definition of &quot;racism&quot; is only about the <em>belief</em> that the races are different. There&#39;s no possibly way we can prevent people from having those beliefs. As long as they can express those beliefs without using derogatory terms and without suggesting that different races should be treated differently, then I don&#39;t think they should be censored. </p>

<p>When you are down and in trouble, keep fighting. Don&#39;t give up, keep kicking. It won&#39;t help to wallow in self-pity, or curse your stars or play the blame game. Every adversity has an opportunity couched within. It is up to us to grab it. And what you do when the going gets tough, is what defines your outcomes.</p>

<p>Life is not a battle that we have to keep fighting for everything, but about survival, make sure you help others survive as well. Its not about what we achieved, but how we achieved it.</p>

<p>HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!</p>
