        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There was obviously a massive conspiracy involved in the JFK assassination.</p>

<p>Consider the evidence:</p>

<p>.Oswald was trained in Russian by the military before defecting to the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>.When Oswald did defect, the military and US govt permitted him to leave the US. When Oswald returned back to the US, he was never debriefed. Every year thousands of American tourists were being debriefed after visiting Soviet Union, but not Oswald.</p>

<p>. The exact timing of the gunshots, according to the Warren commission, has never been replicated with the necessary accuracy. </p>

<p>.Oswald supposedly shot officer JD Tipitt, but the only witness (Domingo Benavides) couldn&#39;t identify Oswald as the shooter. Only after Benavides&#39; twin brother was killed, in a mysterious bar incident, did Benavides identify Oswald. </p>

<p>.JFK&#39;s head snaps back and to the left during the assassination, not forward. Yet the Warren Commission claims Oswald shot from behind.</p>

<p>. Witnesses heard gun shots from the grassy knoll.</p>

<p>.Acoustics tests have proved there were gun shots from multiple guns.</p>

<p>.Johnson had the JFK car washed clean and Governor Connally&#39;s suit sent to the cleaners after the assassination</p>

<p>.JFK&#39;s body was snatched from Dallas, against doctors&#39; wishes, and taken to Bethesda. There the autopsy was completely bungled and, afterward, a doctor burned his notes. The findings of the Bethesda autopsy contradicted the observations made in the Dallas hospital.</p>

<p>.JFK&#39;s brain went missing in 1966 and has never been found, despite being locked up in tight security.</p>

<p>. Oswald claimed he was a pasty after the assassination of JFK. </p>

<p>. After murdering Oswald, mafia man Ruby makes claims about LBJ being responsible for the JFK assassination and claims the govt injected him with cancer. </p>

<p>.A huge number of JFK witnesses died mysteriously during the investigation.</p>

<p>.After Judge Jim Garrison put Clay Shaw on trial, he was the target of two attempts. The first was an indictment on taking bribes, which he beat. He later was charged with child molestation, but beat that too. </p>

<p>.Jim Garrison was derided by the media as a crank, but the Grand Jury agreed with his indictments of Clay Shaw and David Ferrie. Later, his chief witness David Ferrie died and another witness, Dean Andrews, committed perjury. Clay Shaw lied too during the trial and said he wasn&#39;t a CIA informant, but later the CIA admitted he was (after Shaw&#39;s death). </p>

<p>.CIA officer E Howard Hunt confessed to planning the assasination.</p>

<p>.LBJ&#39;s mistress also claims that LBJ told her he had a hand in killing Kennedy.</p>

<p>.LBJ was being investigated for bribes shortly before the assassination, when the chief investigator died under mysterious circumstances - multiple gun shot wounds to the head. Then LBJ becomes president and the investigation is shut down.</p>

<p>.LBJ&#39;s lawyer Barr McClellan claims that LBJ is guilty.</p>

<p>.The United States House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations in 1979 wrote a report claiming multiple gunmen shot at JFK. For some reason, this has been ignored.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the odds are strongly in favor off a conspiracy of some sort. Oswald was obviously doing intelligence work at some point,but that doesn&#39;t rule out the lone nut angle. I also don&#39;t accept the back-and-to-the-left proves anything either way. </p>

<p>The most suspicious evidence is the number of bullets found, Ruby&#39;s assassination of Oswald, his attorney&#39;s revelation of the confession (as you note), but it&#39;s Oswalds statement about being a patsy that gets me. </p>

<p>What sort of political assassin doesn&#39;t either deny everything or provide their reasoning?  The small man who changes history by himself claims to be this lowly patsy? That sounds like someone who was part on an operation to me. It&#39;s an odd thing to have said for someone who had acted alone.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Just wanted to include the most persuasive facts thinking it might be Oswald on his own:
1. He was a)male, b)political, c)down on his luck, d)young, e)with a history of mental illness (suicide attempt), f)and could use a gun. He definitely fits many of the stereotypes.
2. Attempted killing of Gen Walker (if you accept it)
3. Present at book depository then flees with a gun to a movie theater (leaving out Tippit, if he brought the gun in to work, etc.)
4. Gun ordered in his name ends up in a sniper&#39;s nest at his place of work...he was a trained as a shooter in the Marine Corps.</p>

<p>EDIT 2:  </p>

<p>Just got me thinking about how unfortunate it would be if Oswald really was insane and acted alone. Even if you accept that, you have to deal with the strange world he came out of. Cold war era intelligence ops with their assassinations and working with criminals naturally makes people suspect a coverup. The US really was funding assassination attempts and coups all over the world at the time, the CIA director in charge of such things had just been fired by Kennedy (Dulles), and a crooked vice president was facing scandal (oh yeah, and the crazy politics of the time had led people to fear for Kennedy&#39;s life if he ever did go to Texas). Then there was the terrible Warren Commission with Dulles running things (odd choice) and everything they left out or failed to explain. </p>

<p>If you had had a reasonable government not conducting covert assassinations, if they weren&#39;t corrupt, and if politics weren&#39;t so crazy, the lone nut theory is more believable--of course it can&#39;t be looked at in a vacuum. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me the closest thing to a smoking gun is the fact that the testimony of anyone who disagreed with what the autopsy photos showed was left out of the HSCA and Warren reports.</p>

<p>They were willing to go as far as to say in the HSCA report that it was a conspiracy but if they had allowed testimony that showed the autopsy photos were altered then suddenly the conspiracy is one from inside the government and it changes everything.</p>

<p>Other very convincing evidence comes from the testimony of a former military guy who was trained in assassinations. (can&#39;t recall the name. He told his story and showed the documents on The Men Who Killed Kennedy) Said he was asked to assassinate someone but when it turned out to be a US citizen he said he wouldn&#39;t do it. (it was the guy who was working on all of the JFK footage). 
Later this person was assassinated and the guy who was originally asked took his old military docs, found the name of the guy who was also asked to do the assassination, and requested contact info for him through the government. His first request was met with silence. He threatened to go to congress with his second request and they replied that the person he was asking about NEVER EXISTED. He has the documents that show this person certainly did exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Patsy is such a weird thing to say. It actually implies involvement or guilt, like he was involved, but taken advantage of. This is just doesn&#39;t make sense to me. </p>

<p>Traditional political assassins have very clear reasons for their actions they want known to everyone. A politician isn&#39;t a close friend afterall, these are intentional acts done for a purpose. Military/covert assassins are the opposite of the traditional type. They act in concert and at the behest of others, and they may or may not feel strongly about the killing.</p>

<p>With Oswald you have a guy involved in politics (perhaps just as a cover) with both his defection/return and the fair play for Cuba movement (and that does fit with what I would expect of an assassin). And we know Oswald could talk about policy when he wanted to--he even went on TV (maybe it was radio) and did interviews about Cuba policy. If on his own he had cared enough to assassinate Kennedy, wouldn&#39;t he have let us know the motive--are there many instances where he didn&#39;t speak his mind? His evasive responses are exactly what I would expect of a covert assassin. </p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t prove anything, of course...it&#39;s not particularly strong evidence because we don&#39;t even know if Oswald knew what patsy meant. It&#39;s just always struck me as a really odd thing for someone to say and leads to my personal hunch that he was involved in some capacity (maybe even shot Kennedy) but wasn&#39;t acting alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think you&#39;d choose that word if hauled by the police and accused of assassinating the president? </p>

<p>It is possible. Maybe Oswald was referring to the Dallas cops, meaning they were jumping on him and victimizing him in their search to find the real killer. This is an awfully broad/expansive outlook. I would think you&#39;d just be interested in letting people know you didn&#39;t do it. Why would you even care why they suspected you? You&#39;d just be pissed they were throwing such an accusation your way.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always thought he meant the conspiracy of which he took part was making him patsy. That is, he was only a tiny player.</p>

<p>This has been proven wrong before, specifically by Penn and Teller on their show Bullshit!</p>

<p>If you shoot somethign like a melon which has a hard shell and a soft, fleshy inside, the entry wound will be small and the exit wound would be large and create a jet stream of material which propels the melon in the direction of the shooter.</p>
