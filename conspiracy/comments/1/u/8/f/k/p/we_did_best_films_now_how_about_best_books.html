    <div class="md"><p><em>Confessions of an Economic Hitman</em>.   Best book to explain the world financial system and why it&#39;s fucked up.  Told from the perspective of a guy who ruined the economies of many nations (on purpose) and lived to regret it.</p>

<p><em>Manufacturing Consent</em>.   Noam Chomsky explains how the TV lies to you.  Many many examples, highly academic.</p>

<p><em>Blackwater</em>.  Jeremy Scahill goes in depth on mercenaries in the modern world, how they function, why it&#39;s fucked up, and the seedier, more violent examples of just how scary and terrible war is, and how that reality is kept from us by sending poor people from other countries to die in our wars of profit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, John Perkin&#39;s book Confessions of an Economic Hitman was a life changing read for me. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Economic-Hit-John-Perkins/dp/0452287081">http://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Economic-Hit-John-Perkins/dp/0452287081</a></p>

<p>Another book by John Perkins which is also a great read is The Secret History of the American Empire. (Equally life changing)</p>

This is a great book that compares the ways of past dictatorial governments to the ways of our government today. It was written in 2007 while Bush was still in office but it is even more applicable today than it was 7 years ago. A very quick and easy read and one that you will not want to put down. Additionally, you will be able to truly tell people we live in a Fascism after having read this! </p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>The Open Conspiracy</em> by HG Wells (nonfiction)  -- a breakdown by HG Wells about the coming global government and how they are not doing it in secret they are very open and blatant about it.</p>

<p><em>Propaganda: The Formation of Men&#39;s Attitudes</em> by Jacques Ellul (nonfiction) --- probably the BEST book on what propaganda is, how it works, how its used, how it affects people, etc.  You can turn to any page and have your mind blown.  </p>

<p><em>Green Hell: How Environmentalists Plan to Control Your Life and What You Can Do to Stop Them</em> by Steven Milloy  (nonfiction)   --- A well done expose of how &quot;green&quot; policies are really just control methods that are snowballing.</p>

<p><em>The Disuniting of America: Reflections on a Multicultural Society</em> by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.  (nonfiction) --- this book describes how the US is being intentionally divided through ethnocentric academia and media.</p>

<p><em>Collectivism A False Utopia</em> by William Henry Chamberlin  --- written pre-WW2, the author documents the parallels between Nazi Germany and Communist Russia noting that even though their ideologies are seemingly opposite, they are more alike than different.  You can also draw eerie parallels to today&#39;s society.  </p>

<p><em>Foundations: Their Power and Influence</em> by Rene Wormser.  --- Describes the findings of the 1954 Reece Committee on Tax Exempt Foundations which include the control of academia through the grantmaking process and how the large foundations are working in tandem to create a global government(in their own words).</p>

<p>I have a pretty extensive library, these are books just off of the top of my head.  A few of these are available free in PDF just google them.  </p>
