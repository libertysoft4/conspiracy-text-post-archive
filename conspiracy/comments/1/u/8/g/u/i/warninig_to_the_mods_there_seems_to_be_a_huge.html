        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have noticed that you are making sometimes changes on the side bar of r/conspiracy. I think you forgot to put the word Hypothesis before Conspiracy. And explain that the Hypothesis is based on supositions, not Theories.</p>

<p>The way your front page is showing definintions right now, it looks like only Conspiracy theories exist from nothing. This is misleading, first Conspirologists concieve a Hypothesis, and only after research and gathering of facts it becomes a Theory.</p>

<p>You must know that a Hypotesis is based mainly on supposition, while a Theory is based mainly on something repeatedly tested or is widely accepted.</p>

<p>I really hope that it is just a mistake, and it is not being made deliberately to confuse unaware people. I hope somebody responsable for the side bar changes will corerect it. Here is how the detection and exposition of conspiracies works, in chronological order:</p>

<p><strong>HYPOTHESIS</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>A tentative explanation for an observation, phenomenon, or scientific problem that can be tested by further investigation.</li>
<li>Something taken to be true for the purpose of argument or investigation; an <strong>assumption</strong>.</li>
<li>The antecedent of a conditional statement.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>THEORY</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>A set of statements or principles devised to explain a group of facts or phenomena, especially one that has been <strong>repeatedly tested or is widely accepted</strong>  and can be used to make predictions about natural phenomena.</li>
<li>The branch of a science or art consisting of its explanatory statements, accepted principles, and methods of analysis, as opposed to practice: a fine musician who had never studied theory.</li>
<li>A set of theorems that constitute a systematic view of a branch of mathematics.</li>
</ol>

<p>I really hope someone is willing to correct this huge error in definition, and correct the definition as soon as possible. I mean, kids at school knwo this, this mistake is something implausible made here by adults.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While i agrer with your sentiment that the knowledge of these definitions is kind of important, i want to point out that merriam-webster also defines &quot;Theory&quot; as:</p>

<p>1 : the analysis of a set of facts in their relation to one another 2 : abstract thought ; speculation </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel the definitions in the side bar are aligned with these definitions from merriam-webster. Sure, other definitions exist, some that go more in depth, and some more accepted in scientific circles, but as a public forum, i feel the sidebar definitions are appropriate.</p>

<p>I found no mistake in them, though i can agree they may be a bit simplified (possibly to keep it looking clean rather than clogging the sidebar up with a bunch of words)</p>

<p>Point is, there are several definitions for many words in the english language. You are open only to one, which happens to be the one most commonly used and acceptable in academic/scientific circles. </p>

<p>As i mentioned, the other definitions of the term are quite appropriate for a public forum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, i base my logic on my knowledge that happens to be supported by other sources whose sole purpose is to relay the various definitions of words, some for over a century.. </p>

<p>I received a perfect score on the AP English exam in high school, and graduated top of my class with all A&#39;s, even in English courses. So there goes your first point.</p>

<p>the second, i feel, you over generalized my intended meaning. I meant that r/conspiracy is not a formal scientific journal. It is a public debate inviting all kinds of people for informal discussions about theories concerning conspiracies.</p>

<p>As i mentioned, for the purpose of this sub, one of the definitions of the term &quot;theory&quot; that is represented in the side bar is very appropriate for the community thst makes up this sub.</p>

<p>i even explained that the only definition you allow is also true, but is more applicable for scientific journals and papers by established scientists with heavy credentials. In that kind of community it is necessary for a strict definition of the term, but for this community, the more lax definitions fit perfectly, as the very nature of conspiracy theories is founded in skepticism and speculations, often times not involving a lot of scientific facts or testable claims, such as the taxonomy used with evolution, or the thermodynamics involved with nuclear reactions.</p>

<p>The difference is in context. And it turns out that the definition in the sidebar suites the context of this subreddit.</p>

<p>Its pretty simple, really.</p>

<p>Yes indeed, it is simple to understand that your intent is to leave the wrong definition for conspirology, because this way unaware people will not know that a Conspiracy Theory is something serious, based on argumented facts, and it is not a Conspiracy Hypothesis based on argumented assumptions. Good job, really. I am glad my life does not depend on you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The difference is context. Conspirology aspires to be recognized as a legit branch of science. (Whether or not it is recognized as such is a totally different discussion).</p>

<p>Public forums such as r/conspiracy aspires to be recognized as a source of information, debate, and discussions, without the necessities of credentials gained by years of higher education and expertise obtained by extensive scientific research.</p>

<p>I feel you have misinterpreted r/conspiracy with <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_journal">scientific journals</a> whose standards of quality are much higher than that of the reddit communities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what you are talking about. The definition on the sidebar is wrong. Conspirology is a very serious science, because it has consequences on material world, and our safety / life depend on it.</p>

<p>This is why I wrote the correct definitions for this place, that is based on discussing matters about conspiracies by anybody interested in it.</p>

<p>Conspirologists are able to submit theories, enthusiasts are able to submit  hypotheses. Without explaining the main difference this place is dangerous for unaware people. Because they are unable to see the difference between facts and assumptions.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The definition on the sidebar is wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are several definitions of the term &quot;theory.&quot; Certain versions of the definitions are more aplicable to <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_journal">scientific journals</a> than other versions, as some are more applicable to public <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum">internet forums</a> such as reddit.</p>

<p>I agree with you that the more strict definition of &quot;theory&quot; is better suited for scientific journals, but where we differ is our distinction of reddit:</p>

<p>I believe reddit is an internet forum, and thusly the sidebar definitions suite it well, whereas you feel like this is more along the lines of a scientific journal, and therefore the sidebar definition would be inherently wrong.</p>

<p>I agree that the aspirations of conspirology are serious and important. However, since it is not an accepted branch of science (such as biology, or astronomy), to distinguish conspirologists in a similar fashion as a nuclear physicist would be conceptually inept. Its not that i disagree with its stature or purpose, because i do agree, its just not accepted as so by scientific communities like how other branches are. (Try getting a masters degree in conspirology, i doubt you can. Though i hope this changes in the future).</p>

<p>Again, i agree with your definition, but i also acknowledge the existence of other definitions and their applications. R/conspiracy is not a scientific journal. It is a public internet forum. Therein lies the difference. (If you are uncertain about the differences between scientific journals and internet forums, i included the links in the text above)</p>

<p>TL;DR I dont know how else to explain it. So ill leave it at this point. Its not my fault if you fail to understand the differences of the applications of the definitions of the word &quot;theory.&quot;</p>

<p>I already indicated the point where we disagree, and that is you wish to view r/conspiracy as a scientific journal, while i wish to view it as an internet forum.</p>

<p>That is what im saying. Seriously, you are not going to get what im saying unless you visit the links i provided that explain the characteristics of a scientific journal, and of an internet forum.
