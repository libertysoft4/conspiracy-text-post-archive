    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for pointing me to this.  I haven&#39;t heard of this person before.</p>

<p>However, I&#39;m listening to their interview, and I&#39;m not too certain if I buy it.  For someone who is a member of a group that rules the world behind the scenes, I&#39;d imagine them being much more eloquent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, I started reading the Hidden Hand AMA a few months back and at one point a skeptic asks him/her to prove themself and HH gives a couple of very incorrect predictions, one of which is San Francisco being under water a few years ago, which obviously didn&#39;t happen. I stopped reading at that point. </p>

<p>Not just for that reason, because HH&#39;s act deteriorated quite a bit previously to it, but that was the straw.</p>

<p>Definitely will read up on Svali.</p>

<p>Edit:  I&#39;ve made it through about 80% of the Svali interview, and maybe it is just due to my personal beliefs regarding Christianity, but I find it almost as hard to swallow as HH.</p>

<p>This is mainly due to the fact that I have seen a lot of Christian witnessing hiding under the guise of exposing conspiracy like the Illuminati.  Svali is doing this.  I&#39;m a bit disappointed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree about the law of one.  After first reading it years ago, it didn&#39;t make much sense but after returning to read it in depth I find it extremely congruent to events/experience today (even down to &#39;bigfoot&#39; corroborated by Lloyd Pye).</p>

<p>It should be noted that the &#39;law of one&#39; teachings are similar to hidden hand, but there is a significant deviation regarding the negativity.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t wait to explore The Law of One. My limited reading so far gives me a feeling that I otherwise lack in life. I suppose that is what some people feel is spirituality.</p>

<p>My hidden_hand reading has also been limited but they certainly have many similarities aside from negativity. I thought I saw somewhere that hidden_hand said he was aware of TLoO. Perhaps if HH is real the ancient bloodlines have been misled to work for another entity or ET race instead of self actualization. (Edit: fixed my incorrect terminology)</p>

<p>I have considered putting my head in the sand for a bit to focus on TLoO. Does anyone know of a good sub? </p>
