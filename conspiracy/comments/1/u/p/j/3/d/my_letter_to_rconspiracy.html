        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As many regulars herr have seen, there has been a question asked periodically. &quot;What do we do?&quot;</p>

<p>I wish to address this question by dedicating a post to discussing it:</p>

<p>We all are here for a reason. Some find amusement, some find it a good supplement to research, but most of us are here to search for answers. The underlying motive here is an uncanny feeling we have that something is just not quite right with the world and whats going on in it. </p>

<p>So many &quot;harbringers&quot; of peace; so many well-worded speeches that convince the masses that everything will be okay; so much death and destruction. Something doesnt add up. Many have grown tired and wary. Some turn to complacency in order to find their own peace. Knowing something is amiss without having clear cut answers leads one to ask, &quot;what do we DO?&quot;</p>

<p>First, it is important to understand something. (This comes from my personal opinions). Assuming TPTB are guilty of all allegations in this sub, we must understand how intelligent they are. How skilled. How motivated.</p>

<p>Ive heard people dismiss all of what we talk about here, on the account that &quot;oh ive been alive for sixty years and its the same old shit,&quot; or &quot;people have been crying wolf for years!&quot;.... You get the picture.</p>

<p>The thing to understand, though, is this is by design. TPTB arent just one race of people, they arent just from one country, they dont follow the same creeds, and they dont all have the same cultural background. They arent even from one generation.</p>

<p>Its the slowkill. Theyve been at this for generations. O, what motivation and dedication they must have to follow an agenda passed onto them by their own ancestors, for generations, without fail or falter. Their perserverence is admirable. </p>

<p>Ours MUST be more so. We must not grow wary, nor complacent. We must understand that they play with strategies covering timeframes greater than the lifespan of a human. Slow, incremental changes to the system, so as to be stealthy, and to allow acclimatization of the masses to inadvertantly and unknowingly accept what is to be their enslavement. Its manipulation at its best, and it spans generations. </p>

<p>The point is, nothing may happen in our lifetime. Our skepticism, our suspicions may be 100% correct, but we are doomed to fail if our ideas die with our bodies. Therefore, we must educate not only ourselves, but the next generation who will come to take our place in this everlasting war. </p>

<p>Im not talking about force feeding your kids with conspiracy theories, im talking about education about finances, health, and overall good choices.</p>

<p>You see, TPTB thrive when the people make bad decisions. Bad decisions create dependency upon the government. The more dependent the people, the bigger the government may be, and the more powers are invested upon it. </p>

<p>Take control of your finances. Eliminate debt, however you must. Loans and interest payments are detrimental to a free society, as it creates a downward spiral heading only towards financial enslavement. To own your stuff you own your freedom. Dont take a lease on freedom.</p>

<p>Take control over your health. Bad diets and poor exdrcise are detrimental to a free society, because it gives justification for bogus laws like the affordable care act. Be not a slave to Big Pharma. Lose weight, eat a balanced diet, avoid sugars, unnecessary fats and oils, and seriously start exercising. The more healthy our population is, the less power TPTB can gain. There is a lot of profit to be made off of the sick. </p>

<p>Take self defense classes, learn how to protect yourself and your loved ones. </p>

<p>Take courses on the proper use of firearms. Learn how to shoot, and do it well. </p>

<p>Learn survival skills, we cannot depend on our infrastructure at all times, lest we become complacent.</p>

<p>Pay attention to whats going on in the politcal theatre, lest we become ignorant.</p>

<p>And most importantly, find what makes you happy, and DO IT. Sitting in a cubicle for 1/3 of your life does nothing but offer you a shitty retirement that you will spend doing nothing because of your health situation due to years of sitting, inactivity, and unhappiness. We arent meant to be caged. </p>

<p>All of these things can be done. They are obtainable and real goals we all can achieve. And by doing so, we will live longer, better lives, no matter what nefarious agendas are at play. Teach the younger generations to do the same, and our perserverence can outmatch that of TPTB. It starts on the individual level.</p>

<p>The best part? If nothing happens in out lifetime, we still will live better, longer lives, with the assurance that our children will, too, lead better lives. We, as well as our children, will forever be prepared for whatever may come, whenever it may come, and we would never be forced to cast the first stone.</p>

<p>TL;DR--I explain what we CAN do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one thing I would add to that is to LEARN.  Learn all the time.  Do NOT demonize education or educators.  <em>Always</em> be wary of someone who would tell you that education (for instance, a college education) is &quot;not for everyone.&quot;  Only you can determine that, and only you can determine that by trying it.  Above all else, TPTB have sought to enslave you by making you more stupid.  Our society idolizes ignorance, focuses on the wealthy and famous, discourages education and intelligence, and it&#39;s not at all by accident.</p>

<p>And, as OP said, YOU are in control of all that.  You don&#39;t need to go to a college and simply regurgitate what they tell you.  That&#39;s not even what college <em>is</em>.  Become a (more) critical thinker.  Challenge what they tell you, accept what is acceptable, and reject what is not.  But, you need to be able to know the difference.</p>

<p>NEVER stop learning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks! I agree. I also forgot to add the little things, like stop smoking. Addictions, whatever it may be, help to further enslave us and empower those we depend on for help. And, as in the case of smoking, cessation will often lead us towards a better future and healthier life, further breaking the shackles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree totally.  </p>

<p>Can I add another thing?</p>

<p>Learn to manage your own consciousness and teach your kids how to manage theirs&#39;.  Read Eckhart Tolle, or Sophist literature, or Stoic literature, or read about Taoism.  Anything that can assist you in becoming more aware of the present moment and less wrapped up in your ego is the most helpful thing you can do for yourself and for everyone around you.  </p>

<p>&quot;TPTB&quot;, as OP calls &quot;them&quot;, can only have power over you if you are too asleep, unaware, and/or unconscious to see how you are being manipulated to serve someone else&#39;s profit motive.  The truth is, many people are in an invisible cage and simply gaining the ability to see the bars is freedom in and of itself.  Freedom comes from within you.  It is within your own consciousness - it is only a matter of shedding off the social programming and cultural conditioning in order to find it.  Once you find it, it becomes extremely hard for TPTB to take advantage of you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s mutually exclusive.  I didn&#39;t mean to imply that at all.  </p>

<p>You can have external freedom, or I can lock you in a cage.  In either case, you&#39;re still going to have to deal with your consciousness, ego, and thought patterns.</p>

<p>My point is, people who can control their consciousness are less likely to feel the consumer-culture imposed &quot;need&quot; for things.  The &quot;need&quot; to buy things, the &quot;need&quot; to follow fashion trends, the &quot;need&quot; for patriotism or nationalism to be accepted, the &quot;need&quot; for your boss&#39;s approval, etc.  People who can resist these false-needs are less likely to be manipulated by the hierarchical power structures of governments and corporations.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, also, i want to add that i feel most who ask, &quot;what can we do?&quot; are looking for answers along the lines of, &quot;contact the politicians&quot; or &quot;vote&quot; or &quot;form a militia&quot; or &quot;revolt..&quot;... Or something. </p>

<p>But i feel thise answers dont help much, cuz each of us have neglible influence on the events in question. None of those answers really do much, and offer no tangible results, at least not immediately. </p>

<p>By focusing on the individual level as i have in this post, i was hoping to help people get results immediately that will help with whatever comes.</p>

<p>Im sure youre a free thinker and came up with the belief that self sufficiency, preparedness and independence are all bad values all on your own and there is just no way someone <em>convinced</em> you to think that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Id like to hear your speculations on that, actually. Maybe it was a bit dictative, almost like i was telling people what to do. My intentions were to explain what we CAN eo, at the individual level, with the emphasis that it will produce tangible results both on the individual level, and, if enough people take the advice, on the national levels that TPTB play on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t like speculating as it always seems to lead me into some form of trouble.  After re-reading the post I find myself feeling that it is almost like baiting (not saying this is/was your intent).  The advice is all pretty general and falls under what I consider to be &quot;common knowledge&quot; (which I know is hardly common anymore).  Perhaps your post isn&#39;t critical enough of TPTB for my taste or the advice not specific or creative enough.  I&#39;m not entirely sure.  It is just that the warning bell in my head goes off when I read this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speak for him/her, but I think a large part of the problems today are inherent to capitalism itself.

    <div class="md"><p>I think Marx was correct in his observation that capitalism leads to power consolidation at the top.  </p>

<p>What I see happening in the U.S. is that the people at the top of these massive corporations have so much power that they are able to leverage the government to do their bidding.  This is the best description I&#39;ve seen of the current situation:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_totalitarianism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_totalitarianism</a> </p>

<p>If somehow we were able to completely get rid of the government and have a truly &quot;free-market&quot;, I don&#39;t think it would help the situation.  This group of &quot;power-elites&quot; would find a different way to game the system.  It wouldn&#39;t be called &quot;government&quot;, but it would be some type of oligarchy/aristocracy.  A system with the underlying value of greed will only perpetuate a society of greedy people.  </p>

<p>To me, the bottom line is that in capitalism you eventually end up with a power-elite at the top of the social hierarchy.  Even if you take government away, this is still a problem.  The man at the top of the pyramid looks down to see everyone else climbing up the sides, and therefore operates out of a reaction of <em>fear</em>.  We have a fear and greed based society.  </p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t see how completely anarcho-capitalist &quot;free markets&quot; would increase production efficiency, stop the environmental crisis, or promote equality, safe working conditions, and everything else progressive movements have had to fight for.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The power greedy elites will always game the system, no matter what type of system we have in play. That is the entire point of limited governance. We have to limit their ability to use violence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think Marx was correct in his observation that capitalism leads to power consolidation at the top.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Karl&#39;s solution to this problem is to skip the power struggle that occurs through corporatism and place a few key elites in control of it all. The libertarian philosophy (true capitalism) is a small business based economy void of government influence. This method, if it is not corrupted, prevents large organizations and rich assholes from using government (violence) against others. </p>

<p>It&#39;s true that a mixed set of repubs, demos, and libertarians would not work as efficiently as all libertarians. However at some point in the near future we will have to replace the current paradigm with something. I think a true free market with very limited, and at the very least decentralized government, is our best choice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said Marx was correct in his observation of capitalism, I did not say I agree with his solutions.  </p>

<p>As far as solutions go: I know The Zeitgeist Movement has gotten a lot of criticism in the past (and most of it rightly so), but recently they&#39;ve been putting information together that looks very promising.  For example: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9FDIne7M9o">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9FDIne7M9o</a>.  I&#39;m very impressed that they&#39;ve been able to absorb the criticism of their ideas and develop solutions to address those shortcomings directly.  </p>

<p>The problem I see with the libertarian ideas you present is that it&#39;s still essentially free market capitalism, which: will lead to a power-elite, will lead to wealth inequality and structural violence, still does nothing to stop the environmental crisis or put an emphasis on efficiency and sustainability, cuts out all the &quot;good&quot; things a centralized government can provide like healthcare and infrastructure, and still systemically runs on greed, growth, competition, and the profit motive.  I see that as a continuation of our current paradigm - not a paradigm shift.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you can remove human nature, which includes greed and competition in some people. What we can do is limit people&#39;s ability to use violence against others. Currently our system allows corporations to bribe politicians to create legislation, allowing the use of violence to further the corporate agenda. To get around this, we must limit the federal government. </p>

<p>The environmental thing is a myth. Libertarians aren&#39;t anarchists. Preventing the destruction of the environment is one of the few things that government is necessary for.  </p>

<p>I am interested in the Zeitgeist movement though, but I would have to take a refresher course before I can speak intelligently about it. I&#39;ll watch the link you provided and get back to you later. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, man.  I used to be into the libertarian ideas more.  I read a lot of Ron Paul, listened to Stephan Molyneux a little bit.</p>

<p>However, my viewpoint has shifted as I&#39;ve watched/read more from Chris Hedges, Cornell West, Chomsky, and R. Buckminster Fuller.  The libertarian ideas began to make less and less sense as I learned more about alternatives (Resource-Based Economics, The World Game, Socialist Libertarianism, Anarcho-synidcalism), and the crux of the issue for me is that one of the key assumption in free-market ideology is freedom of information (that we&#39;ll <em>know</em> if/when a business is screwing us over and then in turn act rationally to leave that business and go to the competition).  However, in the real world information is often hidden and people are not always rational.  </p>

<p>Also, free-market ideology lacks things that are <em>moral</em> imperatives to me: the environment, wealth equality, public health and the end of structural violence, efficiency and sustainability, non-hierarchical modes of organizing society, and end to the idea that you have to &quot;earn a living&quot;.  </p>

<p>I think (though hope may be a better word) as we move into the future we&#39;ll have the technology to see the entire earth as one system and realize Fuller&#39;s objective to: &quot;make the world work for 100% of humanity in the shortest possible time through spontaneous cooperation without ecological damage or disadvantage to anyone&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. My wife and i own our cars, they are all paid for. We rent an apartment, so no mortgage. We paid all of our credit card debt off (which wasnt much) and dont use our credit cards. We finished off out student loan debt. We are frugile about our groceries, which, as it turned out, inadvertently became a vegetarian diet with eggs being the main source of protein (dont get me wrong, ill eat the shit out of a juicy steak or hearty burger, its just meat is so expensive, and this diet is much healthier), we dont seek too many possessions. We coukd pack up our two cars full of our belongings and move out of our home in less than a day. Id bet we can do it in just a few hours. </p>

<p>We have computers and stuff, which is helping those corporations, but we arent huge activists anyway. We just decided that we can do without the tiny bullshit and live below our means, so as to be debt free and dependent upon our own selves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THIS. What a lovely message, I have recently been been asking my self this question &#39;What can I do?&#39; a lot and always hit a brick wall. But this, for me personally, confirms what I should be doing. Take life into your own hands, DO what makes you happy and spread the happiness onto others. </p>

<p>I do have one question for anyone willing to help me, I would love to understand financial systems and how to make the best of my money. Where should I start my journey for learning this kind of skill?  </p>

<p>And most importantly, find what makes you happy, and DO IT. Sitting in a cubicle for 1/3 of your life does nothing but offer you a shitty retirement that you will spend doing nothing because of your health situation due to years of sitting, inactivity, and unhappiness.

    <div class="md"><p>I see your point, and agree to some degree. I wasnt trying to be insulting or sugarcoat anything. I was trying to make it noticed that TPTB gain their power due to the dependence of the people on their systems. </p>

<p>To liberate one from the system, to be self-sufficient and self-reliant, then TPTBs grip will be loosened. </p>

<p>This society has a system that enslaves us everywhere we look. Occupational enslavement, financial enslavement, health enslavement, they are all intertwined. And by design. </p>

<p>Its no accident that Big Pharma and the DEA collude to create toxic pharmaceuticals in lieu of natural remedies that work. So, to gain control over your own health and take responsibility of your own decisions, you can lessen Big Pharmas grip on you, and becomd one less person they can make a profit off of. </p>

<p>All the points i made were similar to this. They gain power by money made due to the dependence invested. Lower the dependence, lessen the profits, decrease the power. Its a bonus that these points also offer a favorable post-collapse situation, but wasnt the main point. (Btw, i wasmt aware of that sub, ill have to check it out).</p>

<p><strong>(EDIT: See my reply to my comment for more on this paragraph)</strong>But that was basically my point. I also understand the reason you felt the jist of all i said is to &quot;survive until then,&quot; but that wasnt what i was trying to go for. That has complacent undertones that i prefer to denounce, and instead i was trying to explain that we can find our own happiness for free, with or without materialistic ventures. And we dont have to subjectify ourselves into the various types of enslavement that the corporate/government/society &quot;norms&quot; bestow. </p>

<p>I hope i addressed your concerns properly, if i misunderstood what you were saying, please, correct me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh i forgot to re-emphasize the timeframe at which TPTB play on. It spans over generations, so i was just pointing out that if nothing seems to happen, these pieces of advice will still be fruitful. If something does happen, these pieces of advice will prove beneficial. Either way, these pieces of advice will also lessen TPTB grip. </p>

<p>I hope that clears that part up (referencing your &quot;to just survive until then&quot; comment). I wasnt trying to sell complacency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, you may feel that way because i dont always follow my own advice. I didnt mean this to be interpreted as a retreat from society. I just meant from the enslavement. Obviously, you have to do what you have to do. If you hate your cubicle job, but need the money and cant get another job, you dont have too much of a choice. Therefore, i label that as occupational enslavement. The point of the advice was to look at these aspects of life, and change what you can. Maybe you cant change ALL of the things ive pointed out, hell, i cant even quit smoking cigarettes. </p>

<p>But the intent was to focus on what you can change. And all of these things, when enslaved to them, give power to TPTB. </p>

<p>The self reliant stuff was &quot;just-in-case&quot; kind of things. If shit hits the fan, will you still be able to provide for your family? 
Yea, a lot of post-collapse stuff was included, but i felt it was relevant. For, if we did not have these skills, we become dependent on the system and its infrastructure, which could collapse at any time (or in five hundred years, but thats not the point), in a perpetual hope that the system and its infrastructure will continue, because you wouldnt be able to deal with the collapse.. </p>

<p>The idea is to not be dependent on these things. The less dependent you are, the more control you have over your own life, and the less TPTB have over you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. My wife and i own our cars, they are all paid for. We rent an apartment, so no mortgage. We paid all of our credit card debt off (which wasnt much) and dont use our credit cards. We finished off out student loan debt. We are frugile about our groceries, which, as it turned out, inadvertently became a vegetarian diet with eggs being the main source of protein (dont get me wrong, ill eat the shit out of a juicy steak or hearty burger, its just meat is so expensive, and this diet is much healthier), we dont seek too many possessions. We coukd pack up our two cars full of our belongings and move out of our home in less than a day. Id bet we can do it in just a few hours. </p>

<p>We have computers and stuff, which is helping those corporations, but we arent huge activists anyway. We just decided that we can do without the tiny bullshit and live below our means, so as to be debt free and dependent upon our own selves.</p>

<p>Like you said, the difference may be small, but the more people do this the more the influence and momentum grows...</p>
