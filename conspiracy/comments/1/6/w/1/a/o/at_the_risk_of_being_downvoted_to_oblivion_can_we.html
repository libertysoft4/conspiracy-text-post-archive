        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve seen just about the worst sources in my life presented as fact in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> over the last few months. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been told seriously by people here that I need to take 4chans /b/ as a credible source of information from which to base ideas. I&#39;ve been told that Infowars, Alex Jones, Examiner, and a host of other terrible writings are &quot;credible&quot; sources. </p>

<p>This subreddit behavior has become so common that I&#39;ve begun to believe one of the following:</p>

<p>1) <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is now being gamed by enough for-profit groups with large online staffs (such as Infowars) that push their own material to the top to the detriment of the conversation going on in these threads. </p>

<p>2) enough trolls have gotten in here to turn it into just one giant joke and circlejerk as the existence of <a href="/r/conspiratards">/r/conspiratards</a> somewhat confirms. </p>

<p>3) the government internet folks are working hard in here to get people to say things they don&#39;t really mean for use as some conspiratorial &quot;further date&quot;. </p>

<p>My guess is option #1, but <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, what do you think? Is the content of this subreddit declining to crap rapidly, or do I just somehow suck? </p>

<p>For example some people are actually posting pictures of funerals and quotes from the parents of the &quot;dead&quot; kids at Sandy Bridge!  Can you believe it?  They are trying to prove with &quot;facts&quot; and &quot;evidence&quot; that which we all know simply isn&#39;t so!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the lack of substantive evidence about Sandy Hook, due partly to circumstances and partly tight police control over existing evidence has divided opinions more sharply than per usual. We don&#39;t have enough facts to work through, so we call each other names while watching a set of particularly obnoxiously misleading YouTube videos.</p>

<p>IMO, 2nd amendment interests have invaded and as shills usually do, try to discredit dissenting views by maligning their motives. In a way, I think it&#39;s kind of like Eternal September.</p>

Start reading YouTube comments and your hopes for humanity start to decline rapidly...

    <div class="md"><p>Ive got to disagree with the intellect part. I joined this subreddit about a  year ago and it was way better, but over the course of the year it has turned into more and more tinfoil hat wearing, Alex Jones loving crazies. </p>

<p>Also, not to start anything, but the Sandy Hook pics where they were claiming some of the people interviewed were &#39;crisis actors&#39; were just bullshit. Anyone with eyes could see that those were not the same people.</p>

<p>I do agree that it is a matter of filtering for yourself, which is a belief I have had since I first subscribed here, but it is starting to get to the point where I have to do more filtering than reading and researching, and that is just absurd. Its getting to the point where I pretty much disregard 90% of the posts in this sub as bullshit. Of the other 10%, about half of it is information that is already common knowledge to most of us such as the details of the 9/11 story not matching up.</p>

<p>I mean, if it is now 2013, and you are just now starting to question/read into something that people have been questioning for going on 12 years, I have to question your intellect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, intellect is a broad word mate! My intention was more to point out that the information here is optional to accept - and that you can look at a shitload of evidence (I see this as a place where all the &quot;evidence&quot; is at least present, whether its false or true) and come up with your own conclusion on a basis from what you already know is true. It can indeed be difficult to do that, since every conspiracy could also be a conspiracy within a conspiracy etc. But now I&#39;m just going to defend myself because you are questioning my intellect on a basis of time - while you don&#39;t even know my age ;). All my life these things have kept me busy, I&#39;m not &quot;just starting to question it&quot; now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good quote, but I kinda understand his point though his post doesn&#39;t really matter actually. It would be nice for a change to have just the valid information and not having your mind fucked by the feds every time, but I guess it&#39;s part of the &quot;job&quot; that you can almost never truly know the truth. And I know from personal experience that &quot;waking the sheeple up&quot; doesn&#39;t do any good anyway, except when you talk to people who are willing to listen, which are still pretty scarce. The other group will simply not listen. It&#39;s just a matter of time when this world is willing to wake up, it just sucks for the people who &quot;knew it all along&quot; ;)</p>

<p>I&#39;d say your breakdown hits the major points. Good sources are hard to come by. However, this should push the conspiracy community to strive for authentic information and strong evidence. </p>

<p>Instead we are inundated with unverified claims, poor scholarship, and excruciating Youtube videos filled with innuendo and not much sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We all have to remember also that because it is a conspiracy sources are not readily available. But many people here seem to need a source for at least starting a debate. That&#39;s not how it happens. Shit is classified for a reason.</p>

<p>If we had sources to everything then it wouldn&#39;t be so difficult for people to believe us, right? The conspiracy movement is highly speculatory in itself. This doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s right or wrong. The debate is where we are loosing because people are just like &quot;sources or GTFO&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s showing symptoms of typical subreddit growth.</p>

<p>As easy to digest things such as images make their way to the top with relative ease, more in depth conversation and discussion (the sort of article that takes time to digest) get stuck underneath it all.</p>

<p>People begin to feel less compelled to post in the comments as conversation towards these topics becomes less and less involved and interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The forums insistence on novelty plays right into the hands of lower intellectual standards.   That&#39;s partly why the MSM is so worthless.   More time needs to be devoted to the fundamental idea of honest skepticism,   applied first to the MSM,  government stories,  etc. BUT then to ourselves.   The fact that few on reddit would consider a post or thread more than a few hours or days old tells you this format is going to have some fatal limitations.   R/conspiracy will end up moving to a more mature,  deliberate forum.   What is left will be troll food.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think a MAJOR point not being addressed is that &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39; don&#39;t believe what mainstream media sources say. they are not looked at as credible sources. if you look at the history of mainstream media, you can deduct that they are not credible sources. in fact, the entire basis of the &#39;debunking&#39; of the sandy hook hoax is that the &#39;debunkers&#39; claim that the conflicting reports are due to poor reporting. they say that in the rush to put out apparently just any information out of thin air, they &#39;accidentally&#39; made some mistakes. this seems to happen again and again and again and again... and also, the mainstream media has a pretty good habit of not reporting certain information as well.</p>

<p>so, what the common sleeping fool thinks are the &#39;credible&#39; sources, a person who is awake and thinking uses the holes in those stories to read between the lines (lies). </p>

<p>also, the alternative press has been all over this. many people will choose to ignore or dismiss them because they are not the mainstream news. those again, are the sleeping fools who are ruining the world by letting the sick fucks do as they please as long as they get to live in their little bubble and feel nice and comfy and safe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>but the mainstream media has been proven time and time again to not be credible either. like i said, the crux of the &#39;debunking&#39; argument actually is based on the fact that the media is known to put out false information. not sure if you have ever heard of propaganda but it is real and its not just &#39;the bad guys&#39; who use it. </p>

<p>also, my point was to use your intuition to determine the truth and the lies. i am advocating not trusting any source, mainstream or alternative without serious questioning. what could that hurt? </p>

<p>personally, something does not seem right to me with this incident. actually, a lot of things dont seem right. i dont know happened. i definitely dont think it was how the official story went though. there are a lot of strange things like: 
-why a video clip of adam just even entering the school hasnt been released? 
-whats up with all the reports and police scanner clips of them clearly talking about multiple suspects?
-whats up with the shooters car being registered to a really shady guy? -why did they say his mom was a teacher there when she wasnt? 
-why did they say there was an incident between adam and the school when that didnt happen? 
-why did a nurse who is not in any public records give an interview saying adams mom was a good teacher? 
-why is there an interview with the principal after they said she was shot?
-if adam and his mom had no connection to the school- what was his motive? 
-why so many inconsistencies with the guns used?
-why a huge push for gun control directly after this using this as the direct cause?... </p>

<p>i can keep going but im sure you get the point...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I see the overall problem is that people have realized there is money to be made making conspiracy websites with podcasts and youtube videos.</p>

<p>Looking at sandy hook you can see a lot of straight up lies created by these video makers, probably because they get 15 million views by doing so. So now that generates traffic here where non-ct folks run into the ct community and point out all the BS lies, which threatens CT&#39;s who in defense just blindly defend the video maker and their only recourse is to call people blind or shills.</p>

<p>So ya, I think the CT community is being gamed by the people claiming to promote the CT community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) no, not for a mere 100K readers. Not a chance.
2) Likely. I love to have these sorts of conversation (conspiracy) but there are just too many 1)blind stupid sheep  and 2) people who think EVERYTHING is a conspiracy in here for it to be possible. It makes everyone look like an utter ass.
3)Not for 100k people. Not saying it doesn&#39;t happen, but not for 0.03 % of the population, probably less because I&#39;m guessing a fair number are duplicate/dead accounts. On a weekly basis my guess is this sub sees fewer than 5k readers, only a few of whom actually post. This sub reddit is of zero concern to hte government.</p>
