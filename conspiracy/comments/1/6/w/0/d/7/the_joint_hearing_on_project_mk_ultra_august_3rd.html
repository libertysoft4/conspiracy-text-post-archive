    <div class="md"><p>that is a good one and good share. But may I (do as I do best, ruin a perfectly good thread as usual with my crappy posts) say that if there WAS a real way to control someone&#39;s mind, EVERYone would have their mind controlled? I mean, if it were possible, then we&#39;d ALL be mind controlled. I dont think they are using any &quot;magic potion&quot;. They are using the easiest, most innocuous medium imaginable. The media itself. The media IS the message. Yuri Bezmenov explains it nicely look him up. So does Brian Gerrish talks especially his expose on demoralization. Mind control is not so super secret, it&#39;s really right in front of us. </p>

<p>On the other hand, my very old ex military uncle described to me how gunshots are extremely effective in changing someone&#39;s mind very well. haha, I meant the SOUND of them, close to the subject. Fear is a solid way of getting someone to see &quot;your side of things&quot;. </p>

<p>There is a woman quite famous on the whole mk ultra &quot;monarch&quot; mind control scene, who whenever I mention the fact that she is obviously mentally disturbed I get harassed online. Talk about &quot;shills&quot;! (brice taylor her name) she was on our L.A. channel 13 in the &#39;90s for a show they were doing on extreme mental illness such as delusions of grandeur, etc. The viewers thought channel 13 was &quot;covering up the truth&quot;. It was obvious to everyone that she had (has.. ) some serious &quot;issues&quot;. If you read up on her, that she &quot;remembered&quot; all her bizarre experiences as the result of creating coaxing by a dubious &quot;erased memories&quot; consultant, and that NOW she herself is running one of those &quot;erased memories&quot; clinics, you&#39;ll see what I mean. She literally was in a car accident, in coma, and some creepy woman coaxed these weird, Henry Kissinger and Bob Hope(!) sex slave memories out of her. OK, now I await my harassment from a barrage of her weirdo minions.. ahh.. goodbye, sweet relaxation.... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes I am aware of that scary drug. I also read that meth type drugs can be used in high doses to create a hypnotic although psychotic way. I have always wondered about that drug, the one you mention, as maybe the way children can be kidnapped (or adults for that matter) it is very scary to me.</p>
