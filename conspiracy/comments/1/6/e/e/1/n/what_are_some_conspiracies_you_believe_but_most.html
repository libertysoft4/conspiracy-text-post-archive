<p>But here are mine..
I believe Chris Benoit is innocent, reason being because so things just don&#39;t add up. </p>

<p>Idk if I&#39;m allowed to post links here but here is why 
<a href="http://wweforums.net/thread-2058.html">http://wweforums.net/thread-2058.html</a></p>

<p>One conspiracy that I&#39;m not so sure about is the 27th club. I&#39;ve read up on this and people out there believe they were killed by the CIA and such. </p>

<p>And one I don&#39;t believe that I know people out there believe is that Michael Jackson still being alive. The crazies part is that I know about a video that I came across on netflix with a woman sharing on reasons why she think he still alive along with trying to convience others who have watched the movie to believe the same thing.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you! Someone that didn&#39;t down vote me and run off! </p>

<p>Implanting them would absolutely be bad, IMO. Wearing? I dunno. For me, it would depend on things like where would I need to have one on? If it&#39;s just while at a certain place, I would be ok with that. If it was something like If I leave my house and I have to wear it, that wouldn&#39;t be ok. </p>

<p>Take the Texas school RFID case: If she just needs to flash her badge to open a door, fine. But if the school says she must wear it off site, then no, that&#39;s not good at all. Then again, how would the school enforce students wearing it offsite? Most schools don&#39;t have enough money for the proper hardware to track them offsite. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t see the big deal about the girl in Texas, and other students having to wear one. </p>

<p>Does that make any sense at all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To my understanding they also use it to make sure kids are where they are supposed to be. literally tracking you and your movement throughout the day. I think being forced to comply is &quot;like&quot; the mark of the beast. I for one would never wear one I would give them the finger and get my GED. :)
In the first draft of the Obama Health Care Act it talked of every American who was on it to get an RFID implant. that was quickly stomped out thankfully. But we get tracked everywhere now from Bus transit to the Airport, they use photo and sound identification to track and follow people.  It is kind of the new American way of life I guess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have had to use one to enter the building I work in, but it didn&#39;t bother me. They just wanted crowd control. Stuff started coming up missing, so they started that. Also, while onsite if asked to produce my badge, I had to. It never bothered me. But I can see how some folks would call it the &quot;Mark&quot; but really, don&#39;t we already have that with our Social Security Numbers? What about a Driver&#39;s License number? Those are unique to the person it was issued to. </p>

<p>But I will say you are correct about being documented everywhere you go. They seem to be really wanting to install CCTV cams everywhere. My question is: Who watches the feeds, and who watches the watchers? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point! Work does not bother me at all it is kind of cool to have a badge. :) From what I understand is there is a computer system that documents everything and through identifiers it recognizes people and adds places and such to a profile of you into a data base. And if something arises they can look it up and see where you have been. </p>

<p>It really sucks that the tech is so open to corruption but it is really nothing to fear, it is a useful and smart tool.</p>

<p>However said tools should not be allowed to be snuck in and TBH the news is around to bust when things like this become corrupt, but now the news is corrupt, therefor these technologies ARE in the wrong hands for the time being</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the risk of sounding &quot;shilly&quot; I&#39;m gonna go ahead and say &quot;If you haven&#39;t done anything, why the need to hide?&quot; But, I really tend to stay out of trouble, so they can look me up all they want! LOL! The way I see it is, if they wanted to, they could trump anyone up on all kinds of charges if they wanted to, why go through all the trouble to keep track of you? They could &quot;disappear&quot; you whenever they wanted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many schools doing this so it makes it a bit more difficult to go to another. Plus if it really is against their religious beliefs then so be it. they should not be forced. I can see benefits of using this in a elementary or middle school but not high school. and all you have to do is cover them with foil and they can&#39;t track you. but that is not really the point. BTW having a rfid to get into your building for work is completely different. </p>
