<p>If according to r/conspiratard, we&#39;re all  insane circlejerkers, why bother creating a subreddit to mock and question <strong>us</strong>, if we are all lunatics? I see no r/broniestard, r/spacedickstard. </p>

<p>Just by the fact that these counter-subreddits exist, shows that we&#39;re definitely bothering some people with all our &quot;crazy&quot;. Having opposition is enough to prove that we&#39;re on to something, and you can&#39;t question that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a three year old reddit account that thinks most conspiracy theorists are deluded people who are much more interested in confirming their biases than actually analyzing the world around them. It&#39;s like reading crappy fan fiction, hilarious and slightly terrifying. That is why I subscribe to <a href="/r/conspiritard">/r/conspiritard</a>. I find it amusing. I don&#39;t usually actively mock any of you because I know some of you (not actually you) in real life and I know that they have real life problems and I am capable of empathy.</p>

<p>People make fun of bronies all the fucking time. There probably is a reddit mocking them but I don&#39;t care enough to seek it out. </p>

<p>Your whole line of reasoning is the problem with conspiracy theorists. You can take any opposition or criticism of your ideas and turn it into a confirmation that you are &quot;on to something&quot;. It&#39;s a gigantic circlejerk and often an entertaining one to watch. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Generalization. I don&#39;t consider myself the typical user of this board, but I sure as hell don&#39;t write the rest of the people here off just because there is paranoia, disinfo, and misunderstanding rife in the debate concerning issues posted here. The facts are plain as day, there is an ongoing conspiracy to suppress the actualization of history in many overlapping and profound ways. The whole idea of r/conspiratard is a &quot;circlejerk&quot; whereas much of the info posted and discussed on this board is virtually impossible to find elsewhere. You are a deluded fool if you don&#39;t realize that and choose to call people deluded or say your friends have &quot;real life problems&quot; (who doesn&#39;t?) because they are fucking crippled by the reality of the world around them? Just because things are the way they are, and there is a trajectory we are following doesn&#39;t mean we have to give in and accept to follow a course of events that seems pre-ordained. This whole concept is what r/conspiracy is about in a vague and general way and the fact of the matter whether you choose to believe it or not or call such statements circlejerking but why the fuck wouldn&#39;t that be intentionally and maliciously subverted? Get real homie; this is the modern front of the anti-war movement that has been infiltrated by government and corporate entities since day 1. Grow the fuck up and get off of this board, or tell your boss you can&#39;t do this anymore and try to get some severance pay because what you&#39;re doing is pretty much evil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>False dichotomy. Just because I don&#39;t see the world through the same lens as you does not mean I see it as you say I do. I understand you are insulted by my statements but that is not my intention. I admit it seems a bit patronizing but I cannot see things in such black and white terms. The world is too complex. I despise what Israel is doing in the West Bank and Gaza but I do not deny their right to exist. I am sickened by what we have done in Iraq and Afghanistan but sectarian violence is as old as humanity and there is no easy solution or one group to blame. both sides are guilty. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The facts are plain as day, there is an ongoing conspiracy to suppress the actualization of history in many overlapping and profound ways.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a gross generalization by the way. What are you talking about?</p>

<p>And another thing, calling me evil is silly and a very basic dehumanizing tactic that is pretty reprehensible. If we were having this discussion at work and you knew me personally I highly doubt you would say it to my face. The internet allows us to lock into a feedback loop of our choice and has such a dehumanizing effect that I can laugh at you, anonymous conspiracy theorist and you can rage and call me a paid shill. In real life this sort of behavior would be absurd.</p>

<p>Lastly I don&#39;t think I can change your mind or your world view. Only you can let the blinders fall away and see the world as it is, not as you wish it to be. Chaotic, tumultuous and ever changing. There are no easy answers. </p>

<p>The main reason <a href="/r/conspiritard">/r/conspiritard</a> &quot;targetted&quot; <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is because 90% of the people hear and insane tin hats that don&#39;t realise how hilarious they are.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> is nothing more than a place to laugh at idiot conspiracy theorists, and if you really think that you&#39;re <em>sooo</em> important that people would go to all this lenght (ataining modship, banning people, that bullshit in the second to last line) then you&#39;re suffering from a pretty big delusion over your own importance.</p>

<p>Herkimer is a psychopathic homicide celebrating zealot. Something tells me however that if Corrie were an Israeli protesting Palestinian actions then he would act quite differently. Racist as it gets ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p>Well I was not aware of that, but even a few lines of code should know the Daily Mail is a load of shit.</p>

<p>Well, debate, discuss, understand, talk about, whatever. I was just saying that this guy (who as it turns out is a bot) could use his times to actually put up a decent argument for why x and y are conspiracies, but it turns out they can&#39;t and know I look a bit silly.</p>
