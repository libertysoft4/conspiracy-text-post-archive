<p>That, and the 2nd Amendment isn&#39;t an &quot;inalienable right.&quot; It&#39;s a legal right given to us by the Constitution. You don&#39;t have a right to guns through divine providence, but rather through the tools of the social contract.</p>

<p>To step over the line, the government must take at least one step, which the Executive Branch has never done. You&#39;re not making a mountain out of a mole hill, you&#39;re making a mountain out of a conversation that you had about mountains you&#39;re afraid of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Attacks on my right to peaceably assemble, for one. There was and is a coordinated effort between the feds and banks to shut down Occupy Wall Street (source - <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/05/fbi-occupy-wall-street_n_2410783.html">Huffington Post</a> . Whether or not you agree with them or their tactics, Occupy&#39;s peaceful gatherings were repeatedly met with violence.</p>

<p>Also, I consider any law that makes it harder to get a gun an infringement on my right to bear arms (something the 2nd amendment expressly forbids). They may have become less restrictive, which is good, but it appears there are stricter laws in our near future. Not good.</p>

<p>I never said anything about divine providence. Inalienable - Unable to be taken away from or given away by the possesor.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t so long ago that the right to burn a flag was threatened to be taken away via constitutional amendment. I agree that you have rights under the law, but they are absolutely not inalienable.</p>

<p>No. Stop with this &quot;false equivalency&quot; horseshit.</p>

<p>True. We should make people pass a test and get a license before they are allowed to own a car. Then we should make everybody register their cars, pay a fee to the government to keep a database of them, and pay for insurance in case their car causes harm to any other person or their property.</p>

<p>But surely this would be a violation of our natural rights to private property, no?</p>

<p>down votes for pointing out your flawed argument...cool story bro. Only on reddit. </p>

<p>You can say what ever you want, that&#39;s the beauty of the constitution, for now anyways.</p>

<p>I would love to see what this country looks like when guns are completely confiscated.  Can anyone say nazi, germany?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t find the continued indulgence of the surrender of law abiding citizens weapons a good policy initiative either. Didn&#39;t work in the u.k. where crime rate per capita is higher then the u.s. It won&#39;t work here and in fact the border states crime rate will sky rocket especially with the drug wars still going on. Good luck to anyone who lives along the mexican-american border. </p>

<p>Likewise Ben Shapiro was pretty calm and he doesn&#39;t want guns to be taken away. So I am still wondering about this evidence you have that proves that constitutional law abiding citizens are terrorists..you sound like the government lol..I think American&#39;s are just passionate and tired of fake leaders who feed us bullshit like &quot;we love the 2nd amendment&quot;(obama), and then blatantly attack it. </p>

<p>The real evidence supports the 2nd amendment and the destruction of &quot;gun free&quot; zones. The teaching and practice of conceal and carry will always trump &quot;gun free&quot; zones. Clackamas, Maya 14 both stopped by people with conceal and carries. Get the fuck over yourself and stop trying to dump on the constitution..if you don&#39;t like gun laws...LEAVE!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Piers rants and screams as well..just you tube him. Saying the new pro gun grabbers are more docile is also a blatant red herring when trying to make an argument for new gun laws. You can&#39;t say just because people are passionate about firearms that they are crazy and to say that is total lunacy.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would I want to show you more examples of those people? Why would you think a voice of reason in this debate would be out there screaming and ranting?</p>

<p>These psychos are a vocal minority of the gun rights movement. They are mixing, in my opinion, both the first and second amendments in their arguments (i.e. &quot;I think you&#39;re saying some dumbass shit, but it is your right to say it and my right to disagree.&quot;)</p>

<p>The vast majority of gun owners in America keep them locked up when appropriate and safely out of the hands of children and the mentally unprepared.</p>

<p>Cars kill more people than guns.</p>

<p>There is an underlying reason to the gun violence in America, and it is not just about the availability of guns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Returning to tyrannical rule such as England had over the Colonies is not progress.</p>

<p>In looking back at my original four points, you&#39;ve made it abundantly clear what <em>you</em> want.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>You</em> want to be able to violently attack my family without fear of resistance or bodily harm.</p></li>
<li><p><em>You</em> want to be able to violently attack my freedom without fear of resistance in order to enslave me to <em>your</em> will</p></li>
<li><p><em>You</em> want to be able to violently invade my home without fear of resistance or bodily harm.</p></li>
<li><p><em>You</em> want to be able to violently deny any other of my inalienable rights as enumerated in the Constitution without fear of resistance. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Common criminals like you are one of the reasons the 2nd Amendment exists. </p>

<p>Since it is <em>you</em> that wants to violate the US Constitution then it is <em>you</em> that should &quot;just usher yourself out&quot;.</p>
