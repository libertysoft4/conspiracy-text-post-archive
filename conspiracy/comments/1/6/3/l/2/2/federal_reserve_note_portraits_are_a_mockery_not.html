        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here is a list of the different denominations of our money. The portrait on the money is always someone who was either a staunch opponent to the central banks, or someone who was duped into helping the central bank and regretted it later. I am posting this because it irritates me how the money changers use the people who tried to rout them out as their poster boys. It truly shows that history is written by the victors. Whenever you count their money, and believe that it is yours, you should know that the face on the bills and coins are frowning upon you.</p>

<p>.01 The Penny. Abraham Lincoln.
Abraham Lincoln hated the idea of a central bank so much that he created his own money to replace it. These are called &quot;Greenbacks&quot;. He was assasinated for this reason. He said, &quot;I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. As a result of the war, corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated in a few hands, and the Republic is destroyed. I feel at this moment more anxiety for the safety of my country than ever before, even in the midst of war.&quot;</p>

<p>.05 The Nickel. Thomas Jefferson.
Thomas Jefferson wanted our country to print and use our own currency, warning us that &quot;The central bank is an institution of the most deadly hostility existing against the Principles and form of our Constitution. I am an Enemy to all banks discounting bills or notes for anything but Coin. If the American People allow private banks to control the issuance of their currency, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the People of all their Property until their Children will wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered.&quot;</p>

<p>.10 The Dime. Franklin Roosevelt.
FDR said in his innaugural address, &quot;Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men. True they have tried, but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition. Faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the lending of more money. Stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership, they have resorted to exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored confidence....The money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization. We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths. The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit&quot;. And this, sometime later, &quot;The real truth of the matter is, and you and I know, that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government of the US. since the days of Andrew Jackson. History depicts Andrew Jackson as the last truly honorable and incorruptible American president&quot;.</p>

<p>.25 The Quarter. George Washington.
George Washington signed into law the First National Bank. It was suggested to him by the Secretary of the Treasury at the time, Alexander Hamilton. Also in Washington&#39;s cabinet at the time was Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of State. It is important here to understand that George Washington was an isolationist. He did not want anything to do with foreign trade. This is counter-productive to the moneychangers philosophy. He was quoted as saying &quot;The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is in extending our commercial relations to have as little political connection as possible... Why, by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of
European ambition, rivalships, interest, humor, or caprice?... It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world.&quot;</p>

<p>.50 The 50 Cent Piece. John Kennedy.
Our last true President said, &quot;For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed.&quot; He was also assasinated.</p>

<p>$1.00 The Dollar Coin. Dwight Eisenhower.
Eisenhower audited Ft. Knox. It is the last time this has been done. He did not like what he found. Ike warned us against the insiders at his farewell address when he said, &quot;In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or
unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.&quot;</p>

<p>$1.00 The Dollar Bill. George Washington. See The Quarter.</p>

<p>$2.00 The Two Dollar Bill. Thomas Jefferson. See The Nickel.</p>

<p>$5.00 The Five Dollar Bill. Abraham Lincoln. See The Penny.</p>

<p>$10.00 The Ten Dollar Bill. Alexander Hamilton.
Alexander Hamilton was George Washington&#39;s Secretary of the Treasury, and he suggested The First National Bank. He was also a Protectionist and an Isolationist much like George Washington. He believed in taxing or discouraging imports and anti-globalization. He wanted nothing to do with Europe but was played like a pawn. Hamilton was bought by the money changers and at one point said &quot;A national debt, if it is not excessive, will be to us a national blessing.&quot;</p>

<p>$20.00 The Twenty Dollar Bill. Andrew Jackson.
Andrew Jackson once said, when asked what his greatest accomplishment as President was that &quot;I killed the Bank.&quot; Jackson detested the foreign bankers and their minions and once proclaimed to Congress, &quot;You are a den of vipers and thieves and I intend to rout you out, and by the eternal God, I will rout you out. If Congress has the right to issue paper money, it was given them to be used by themselves, and not to be delegated to individuals or corporations..&quot; He vetoed the Banks re-charter and succeeded in removing them. He survived his assasination attempt.</p>

<p>$50.00 The Fifty Dollar Bill. Ulysses Grant.
Ullyses S. Grant had the power to bring the Central Bank back but refused. He was Abraham Lincolns friend, and was assaulted the same night Lincoln was assasinated. He was supposed to be at Ford Theatre. He was quoted as saying &quot;My failures have been errors of judgment, not of intent.&quot; when discussing the failure of the System of National Banks. Lincolnian in philosophy, Grant hated the money changers.</p>

<p>$100.00 The One Hundred Dollar Bill. Benjamin Franklin.
Franklin did not want a Central Bank. &quot;In the Colonies, we issue our own paper money. It is called &#39;Colonial Scrip.&#39; We issue it in proper proportion to make the goods and pass easily from the producers to the consumers. In this manner, creating ourselves our own paper money, we control its purchasing power and we have no interest to pay to no one.&quot; And he also wrote, &quot;The viability of the colonists to get power to issue their own money permanently out of the hands of King George III and the international bankers was the prime reason for the revolutionary war.&quot;</p>

<p>$500.00 The Five Hundred Dollar Bill. William McKinley.
McKinley went directly at the Rothschilds when he launched The Sherman Anti-Trust Act. He opposed any Central Bank stating, &quot;Our financial system needs some revision; our money is all good now, but its value must not further be threatened. It should all be put upon an enduring basis,
not subject to easy attack, nor its stability to doubt or dispute. Our currency should continue under the supervision of the Government. The several forms of our paper money offer, in my judgment, a constant embarrassment to the Government and a safe balance in the Treasury.&quot;</p>

<p>$1000.00 The One Thousand Dollar Bill. Grover Cleveland.
Grover Cleveland saw through the money changers. &quot;The ship of democracy, which has weathered all storms, may sink through the mutiny of those on board.&quot; Like Garfield before him, Grover Cleveland was Jeffersonian in his beliefs of the dangers of a Central Bank. Another Gold Standard President, he said in his inaugural address, &quot;We should never be ashamed of the simplicity and prudential economies which are best suited to the operation of a republican form of government and most compatible with the mission of the American people.&quot;</p>

<p>$5000.00 The Five Thousand Dollar Bill. James Madison.
Madison vehemetly opposed the Central Bank and those who quietly control them. &quot;History records that the money changers have used every form of abuse, intrigue, deceit, and violent means possible to maintain their control over governments by controlling money and it&#39;s issuance.&quot;
Madison was later forced into signing the charter for The Second Bank of the United States.</p>

<p>$10,000.00 The Ten Thousand Dollar Bill. Salmon Chase.
Salmon Chase was U.S. Treasury Secretary under Abraham Lincoln. Along with Lincoln he helped to create &quot;Greenbacks&quot;. The Chase Bank is named after him, although he had no affiliation with it&#39;s owners. His name is their trophy. Salmon Chase later said, &quot;My agency in promoting the
passage of the National Banking Act was the greatest financial mistake in my life. It has built up a monopoly which affects every interest in the country.&quot; Chase disapproved of paper money, cautioning too much could be printed resulting in inflation.</p>

<p>$100,000.00 The One Hundred Thousand Dollar Bill. Woodrow Wilson.
Woodrow Wilson was tricked into signing the current Central Bank, The Federal Reserve, into law in 1913. He was very upset at what he had done and said, &quot;I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our
system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion,
no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alexander Hamilton is the one that you can&#39;t get around. He was a banker.  He also was very much interested in bringing the European model of central banking to the US.  The quote you use also shows he believed in national debt and thought it was a good thing.</p>

<p>Woodrow Wilson is also problematic for your theory. You admit that he, more than any other president, is responsible for creating the Fed.  He also believed his biggest failure was not getting the US to sign on to the League of Nations an idea he basically created and championed at Versailles after WWI.  While he indeed said he was tricked, the central bank was very much in line with his view of a good progressive government. </p>

<p>Wilson you can--kind of--argue, but Alexander Hamilton was a great fried of finance. He wrote prolifically on the subject and drafted all sorts of proposals and guidelines (creating the treasury), so I&#39;m sorry to say this doesn&#39;t add up.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Just to clarify, I like the post too as it&#39;s interesting speculation. </p>

<p>EDIT 2:  Regarding Hamilton and import duties.  You are correct that he was very interested in the imposition of duties.  He helped create the Coast Guard for this very purpose (even designed light houses and the boats used to interdict ships).  So, he was VERY much in favor of taxes on imported goods.  The thing is, he liked them because there was no other way to fund the government, and Hamilton wanted a powerful central government and needed to get funds.  He was in favor of trade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The theory was that Hamilton favored tariffs, which meant he was anti-globalization.  In  fact Hamilton&#39;s love for tariffs was simply due to a need to raise funds absent an income tax.  He was both pro-trade and what today we would call globalist. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t recall how he felt about fiat currency, but I would suspect he favored it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some corrections.</p>

<p>First, one should note that all the coins are from the U.S. Mint and that the Federal Reserve has nothing to do with them.</p>

<p>.01 </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abraham Lincoln hated the idea of a central bank so much that he created his own money to replace it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s no evidence that Lincoln hated central banks. Congress created
Greenbacks to finance the Civil War. There was no central bank currency
in 1862 to replace. Lincoln later created the National Bank system.</p>

<p>That quote is a fake from 1887, denounced by both of Lincoln&#39;s secretaries, as well as historians.</p>

<p>.05</p>

<p>This part of the quote is a fake from the 1930s: &quot;If the American
People allow private banks to control the issuance of their currency,
first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations
that will grow up around them will deprive the People of all their
Property until their Children will wake up homeless on the continent
their Fathers conquered.&quot;</p>

<p>The words inflation and deflation weren&#39;t even used that way during Jefferson&#39;s lifetime.</p>

<p>.10</p>

<p>The quotes from Roosevelt are real, except I think this last part is a commentary that was accidentally joined to the quote from the FDR letter: &quot;History depicts Andrew Jackson as the last truly honorable and incorruptible American president&quot;.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>$1.00 The Dollar Coin. Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower audited Ft. Knox. It is the last time this has been done. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ft. Knox was audited from 1975 to 1987. No significant discrepancies were found.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>20.00 The Twenty Dollar Bill. Andrew Jackson. Andrew Jackson once said, when asked what his greatest accomplishment as President was that &quot;I killed the Bank.&quot; 
I&#39;ve never seen evidence that Jackson said that, although he did once
write &quot;The bank, Mr. Van Buren, is trying to kill me, but I will kill it.&quot;</p>

<p>Jackson detested the foreign bankers </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jackson warned that the Bank of the United States could be taken over by
foreigners, which he thought was a danger. I don&#39;t know that he
&quot;detested the foreign bankers&quot; in general though. He specifically
employed the Rothschilds as agents of the U.S. in France.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>once proclaimed to Congress, &quot;You are a den of vipers and thieves and I intend to rout you out, and by the eternal God, I will rout you out. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That part was not to Congress, but to a delegation of citizens from
Philadelphia.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Congress has the right to issue paper money, it was given them to be used by themselves, and not to be delegated to individuals or corporations..&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a paraphrase of what Jackson said in his <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/ajveto01.asp">veto message</a>: &quot;But if they have other power to regulate the currency, it was conferred to be exercised by themselves, and not to be transferred to a corporation.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>$50.00 The Fifty Dollar Bill. Ulysses Grant. Ullyses S. Grant had the power to bring the Central Bank back but refused. He was Abraham Lincolns friend, and was assaulted the same night Lincoln was assasinated. He was supposed to be at Ford Theatre. He was quoted as saying &quot;My failures have been errors of judgment, not of intent.&quot; when discussing the failure of the System of National Banks. Lincolnian in philosophy, Grant hated the money changers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one is a new one on me, so I haven&#39;t researched it, except just
briefly right now. The quote is from <a href="http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=1275">this State of the Union
address</a>,
but it doesn&#39;t seem to have anything to do with banking. I just searched
a few Grant biographies for anything about banks, but I didn&#39;t see
anything of significance. If there&#39;s some evidence for his feelings
about banks, or that the quote had anything to do with banks, I&#39;d like
to see it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>$100.00 The One Hundred Dollar Bill. Benjamin Franklin. Franklin did not want a Central Bank. &quot;In the Colonies, we issue our own paper money. It is called &#39;Colonial Scrip.&#39; We issue it in proper proportion to make the goods and pass easily from the producers to the consumers. In this manner, creating ourselves our own paper money, we control its purchasing power and we have no interest to pay to no one.&quot; And he also wrote, &quot;The viability of the colonists to get power to issue their own money permanently out of the hands of King George III and the international bankers was the prime reason for the revolutionary war.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is from a hoax circulated by Congressman Binderup in the 1930s and early 1940s. Read the analysis by historians <a href="http://21stcenturycicero.wordpress.com/fraud/how-benjamin-franklin-made-new-england-prosperous/">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>$500.00 The Five Hundred Dollar Bill. William McKinley. McKinley went directly at the Rothschilds when he launched The Sherman Anti-Trust Act.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Sherman Anti-Trust Act was passed 7 years before McKinley became
president. It didn&#39;t have much to do with the Rothschilds since they had
limited investment in America.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>$5000.00 The Five Thousand Dollar Bill. James Madison. Madison vehemetly opposed the Central Bank and those who quietly control them. &quot;History records that the money changers have used every form of abuse, intrigue, deceit, and violent means possible to maintain their control over governments by controlling money and it&#39;s issuance.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an author&#39;s note from Olive Cushing Dwinell&#39;s 1946 book, <em>The
Story of Our Money</em>. Due to an editor&#39;s error, the quote is followed by
&quot;From Writings of Madison, previously quoted. Vol. 2, Page 14.&quot; But
there&#39;s nothing like this in Madison&#39;s writings and the language is
clearly 20th century.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Madison was later forced into signing the charter for The Second Bank of the United States.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Madison was originally against the First Bank, but by 1811, he was a supporter of it, and his administration <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=g9Jd7lBlsDUC&amp;amp;pg=PA108">came out for the new Second Bank</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>$10,000.00 The Ten Thousand Dollar Bill. Salmon Chase. Salmon Chase was U.S. Treasury Secretary under Abraham Lincoln. Along with Lincoln he helped to create &quot;Greenbacks&quot;. The Chase Bank is named after him, although he had no affiliation with it&#39;s owners. His name is their trophy. Salmon Chase later said, &quot;My agency in promoting the passage of the National Banking Act was the greatest financial mistake in my life. It has built up a monopoly which affects every interest in the country.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote was not known during Chase&#39;s lifetime and no source for it
has ever been given. It is almost certainly a hoax.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>$100,000.00 The One Hundred Thousand Dollar Bill. Woodrow Wilson. Woodrow Wilson was tricked into signing the current Central Bank, The Federal Reserve, into law in 1913. He was very upset at what he had done and said, &quot;I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first sentences of the quote are a hoax: &quot;I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country.&quot;</p>

<p>Those don&#39;t appear until 30 years after his death. The rest of the quote comes from two different campaign speeches Wilson gave in 1912, when he was running on a campaign of monetary reform. Wilson was <a href="http://www.salon.com/2007/12/21/woodrow_wilson_federal_reserve/">proud of the Federal Reserve system for the rest of his life.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The supply of coin money in circulation has nothing to do with the Federal Reserve? I am not much of a FED hater and think that the problems with it are more to do with the people who have been running it than anything else. </p>

<p>Also the games the Fed plays with the money supply are no different then the games other countries play with their money supply these days or the games they were playing with Breton Woods gold reserves. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t like that we use petro dollars more than anyone else does but I fail to see another workable solution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the general premise of the thesis of this claim.  I believe the portraits are like &quot;trophies&quot; on the Federal Reserve Notes.  However, there are quite a few factual inaccuracies on the quotes used here. While these historical figures generally were politically in opposition to private centralized banking, these quotes are the same oft repeated false quotes that are easily debunked and thus damage the credibility of the Fed&#39;s detractors.  Just as the pods on the plane were a phony strawman introduced to 9/11 theories and the LIBOR congressional testimony of James Holmes father is a false rumor introduced by Sorcha Faal, these inaccurate quotes serve to undermine the movement to shed light on the Fed.</p>

<p>The Abraham Lincoln Quote first appeared in a book from 1931 but was unsourced.  Here is an article fully deconstructing that quote which gained in popularity after Al Gore used it in his book: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/08/AR2007060802470.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/08/AR2007060802470.html</a></p>

<p>The Thomas Jefferson quote is an amalgamation of some things he said but others are fabrications. Please read here for more info: <a href="http://www.snopes.com/quotes/jefferson/banks.asp">http://www.snopes.com/quotes/jefferson/banks.asp</a></p>

<p>The Kennedy quote is in reference to communism, but is often taken out of context. Some executive orders he wrote did seem to be a major threat to the Fed with his creation of treasury notes instead of Federal Reserve Notes.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have time now to cite other possible inaccuracies. The ones I sourced are merely because I had looked into them previously and could easily spot their falsehood. If I have time later today I will make an edit and include other research.</p>

<p>As I said, the main premise, I agree with. Just be careful using easily &quot;debunked&quot; information as it only hurts the cause of illuminating Truth.</p>

<p>EDIT: I see kahirsch already provided some links on the other political figures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You beat me to it.</p>

<p>Lincoln never said that quote, here&#39;s <a href="http://www.snopes.com/quotes/lincoln.asp">snopes taking about it</a> and here&#39;s <a href="http://americanmissive.com/2009/03/20/did-abraham-lincoln-say-that/">someone else&#39;s decent research</a> on the subject.</p>

<p>However, I agree with OP&#39;s premise, especially concerning Andrew Jackson on the 20, and I still think Lincoln probably agreed with those sentiments.</p>

<p>It&#39;s too bad fake historical quotes have essentially taken over the internet, because while many of them may ring true, they can be used to discredit those who are well-meaning and use them carelessly to prove their points.</p>
