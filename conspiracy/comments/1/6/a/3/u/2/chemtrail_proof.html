    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s an idea: kickstarter campaign to get funding for equipment to measure atmospheric &quot;particles&quot; (I&#39;m not a scientist, but if you can&#39;t get anybody with at least a bit of scientific knowledge you ain&#39;t got shit either) in the air. Measure for one year, combine measuring with pictures etc of this trailblazing stuff. Come up with some fucking evidence.</p>

<p>Look, I&#39;m an open-minded guy and I read this shit every week on here, people taking pictures - sometimes close to where I live - of contrails/chemtrails whatever you THINK it is - ITS NOTHING IF YOU CANT PROVE IT. Come on people! Apply general scientific rules to your ideas and fucking DO SOMETHING.</p>

<p>If something is indeed going on it should be very god damned simple to measure that shit coming down if you do it for a year.</p>

<p>Get some Arduino gear, have an electrical engineer design some cheap gear that can be built to analyze the air for whatever it might be they are spraying (if we are to believe this is what they are doing). Put that design in a few location around - obviously an open design similary to for example Raspberry Pi or whatever so that people can do it themselves, go talk to pilots, aircraft designers, aircraft engineers (In the making of an aircraft there are hundreds if not thousands of people involved and most of them would know what a contrail is - or they wouldn&#39;t have fucking jobs. Do it in this subreddit - get a sort of group going, we can even create a subreddit dedicated for it - get some funding from the people who frequent this subreddit - like I said, kickstarter. I&#39;d be willing to put some money into it but I can&#39;t put any time unfortunately.</p>

<p>To be honest - AGAIN IM AN OPEN MINDED INDIVIDUAL - What are &quot;we&quot; afraid of? Sensors to detect this kind of shit - uploading data via 3G to some central servers for processing etc (if you are a system engineer or similar you can easily see what I&#39;m talking about here) is easy peasy - no big deal. I have seen none of this, I have seen no initiative to make something like this happen - and to be honest this points to the people perpetuating the idea of CHEMtrails as opposed to CONtrails the shills - not the other way around.</p>

<p>I agree I am not making it happen but I don&#39;t have the time - I&#39;m saying I have some coin to put into this if somebody (we would need a few people though) with time and knowledge would be willing to MAKE IT HAPPEN ... C&#39;mon people wtf? It&#39;s EASY - and I&#39;m sure some of you have the time and the skills... And yes I would obviously have one of these units at my location and would pay for it as well.</p>

<p>Until this happens you can all fuck off with your god damned shitty theories and bullshit blogs.</p>

<p>Am I right?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not criticism, it&#39;s an idea to do something about it. Why are you not contributing? (that sounded real offensive, and I don&#39;t mean it like that). But why are you just posting some bullshit links to bullshit blogs without actually contributing with some solid science?</p>

<p>The first picture in your post has been discredited widely as being a photoshopped picture, and although AGAIN I am not sure whether this contrail/chemtrail actually has any worth - the first picture in your post is widely considered a fake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my stock responce but I think the links provide some pretty interesting pieces of evidence: 
would you like to know more? I&#39;d urge you to examine this issue more vigorously, starting with this <a href="http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2011/20110721_particles.html">NOAA article regarding an anomalous doubling in high stratospheric particles in the last decade</a>. There is sufficient evidence that he Western world, particularly the US and EU, engages  in large scale weather modification.</p>

<p>This project has multiple components: the dispersion of aluminum oxide particles in the nano scale to increase &quot;cloud&quot; reflectivity, thus dimming the earth below and secondly, the release of metallic ionizing salts (commonly of Ba and Sr) acting as an electrical medium for <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/niush/chemtrails_and_vtrpe/">military radar systems</a>. Some researchers of this false cloud phenomenon have concluded that part of what we are witnessing may be the byproduct of an antistatic agent, <a href="http://chemtrails.cc/docs/chemtrails.cc_the_not_so_secret_ingredient_02-2009.pdf">Stadis 450</a> used in military fuel. Released high in the atmosphere, all of these fine aerosols (specifically metallic ionizing salts) can stay aloft for long periods of time and be manipulated by ELF antenna for steering high pressure systems.</p>

<p>Geoengineering/weather/environmental modification is an activity militaries, particularly our Air Force, have identified as a power play in satellite mapping (VRPE) and to influence storm tracking and shifting pressure systems.  A LARGE number of these flights are not civilian; moreover modern aircraft engines are much more efficient than these massive plumes of aerosols would indicate.
Even assuming absolute humidity conditions, these extensive and persistent trails are not the product of condensation alone.
Patents abound on mechanisms for dispersion of salts (ie Welsbach).</p>

<p>The health implications are severe---From a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15082100">2004 NCBI article hypothesizing on the origin of MS</a>: &quot;The use of Ba as an atmospheric aerosol spray for enhancing/refracting the signalling of radio/radar waves along military jet flight paths...&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, lets stick with the facts. </p>

<p>This can be used for multiple purposes, as stated above, could be something sinister, could be just a firefighting plane or the like.</p>

<p>We have absolutely no knowledge of what&#39;s in the container at this point.</p>

<p>Why on earth would a government asset, dumping illegal chemicals into the air leave the patient on the tanks?</p>

<p>There is know way of knowing if those pics are contrails or chemtrails. I&#39;ve always noticed that the pics of contrails often have the plane in them, but pics of chemtrails never do. Also people seem to think that contrails don&#39;t last more than a few seconds, when they can infact last a fair while. </p>

<p>Also distributing chemicals at such high altitudes is foolish because they would disperse over a very very large area, so the chemicals either have to be extremely potent to work, yet nothing seems to show up when testing is done. Food and drink (mostly water) is a much more sensible way of going about such thing. If it&#39;s in the water then it gets into peoples gardens and such a lot more easily.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t proof that it is a chemtrail plane, it&#39;s just proof that such a thing is possible. And we have known for a long time that this sort of thing is possible.</p>
