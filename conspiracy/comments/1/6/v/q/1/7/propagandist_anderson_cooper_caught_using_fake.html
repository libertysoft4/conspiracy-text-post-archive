<p>It appears to me  that this &#39;incriminating&#39; footage has been added later to his original face to camera spoken piece.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is CLEARLY a clumsy reedit. When Anderson is speaking, there isn&#39;t a CNN ticker. When the video cuts away from Anderson, suddenly the ticker says &quot;BREAKING NEWS: 26 KILLED IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SHOOTING.&quot; </p>

<p>Considering the Cooper piece was broadcast nearly a month after the shooting, why would CNN be airing that as &quot;Breaking News?&quot; This is clearly a clumsy reedit. You people are fucking dumb sometimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm...Again I may be hopelessly wrong here BUT the piece by Anderson Cooper looks and sounds remarkably like his AC360 daily podcast 1/11/13.</p>

<p>WITHOUT the edited footage and overdub. </p>

<p>This was posted in an earlier attack thread &#39;Anderson Cooper humiliates on love TV anyone questioning the details of the Sandy Hook shooting&#39;..</p>

<p>Excuse my lack of tech skills, but does this seem odd?...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks to kahirsch, I, as well as everyone here now know that Cooper&#39;s original broadcast was altered. I can concede that without hesitation, and move on towards gathering verified the truth of what happened at Sandy Hook. My admission also does NOT excuse Anderson&#39;s hit-pieces designed to tar brush any and ALL truth seekers as &quot;Internet Terrorists&quot; and &quot;sick Conspiracy Theorists&quot;. For Cooper&#39;s mission is to drive away the masses from issuing any sincere inquiries and challenge to the rubbish the media and government are promoting as fact in the Sandy Hook case. Cooper and others have launched an offensive campaign to herd everyone back into believing whatever they promote without question. However, the proper response to this kind of attack by any sincere person with questions should be... &quot;What are they hiding by denigrating amateur investigators and concerned citizens? Why are they trying to scare us away with implied threats of guilt by association?&quot;</p>

<p>If these so-branded &quot;crazies and conspiracy nuts&quot; are so bad and hurtful to the victim&#39;s families, then why publicise the actions of some trigger happy or misinformed individuals? Why would Anderson exacerbate it more, by putting on sequential programmes highlighting them and  propagating their alleged fallacies? Why not just ignore it altogether instead of publicising it over and over, and attacking anyone who even challenges the official story? The reason is to divide and conquer by associating any inquiries into the shooting, with evil stalkers, insane fantasy believers, and disturbed individuals deliberately distributing misinformation. </p>

<p>People, whether you realise it or not, we are in the midst of an information war between those who are waking and pursuing the truth and those who will lose it all if it is ever revealed. Did you know for example, that the US Air Force actually deploys members of the USAF Mobility Command to masquerade as members of forums just like Reddit? Their mission is to advance the government position, create dissension and in-fighting and discredit anything that may threaten the official agenda.</p>

<p>I wrote the following on that very subject in my blog:</p>

<p>In a seemingly related story, the US Air Force Air (USAF) Mobility Command as of June of last year, is seeking to implement software called the Online Persona Management Service (solicitation number RTB220610). What this is, is software that will allow 10 personas per user, replete with background, history, supporting details, and cyber presences that are technically, culturally and geographically consistent. In other words, the software mimics fake users from diverse parts of the world, complete with backgrounds, histories and everything necessary to create fraudulent internet users. </p>

<p>Pay attention to this next paragraph: Individual applications will enable an operator to exercise a number of different online persons from the same workstation and without fear of being discovered by sophisticated adversaries. Personas must be able to appear to originate in nearly any part of the world and can interact through conventional online services and social media platforms. The service includes a user friendly application environment to maximize the user&#39;s situational awareness by displaying real-time local information. The goal? Create a virtual army of faux users to generate a fraudulent consensus of commentary. In other words virtualised tactical opposition strategically deployed to drown out reason, truth and facts in forums, blogs, and anywhere there&#39;s public commentary on current or events of mass interest. It can more accurately be described as Pseudo Flash Mobbing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not the originator, nor the creator of this video, so you should contact the person responsible on YouTube to ascertain it&#39;s veracity. I just discovered it and thought it was very interesting to throw on the table and analyse. It&#39;s best to consider everything until it is in fact PROVEN to be otherwise. Even if this video wasn&#39;t what it purports to be, it does not absolve Anderson Cooper in any way from his malicious, agenda-driven, government sponsored hit-pieces. Anyone who has sincerely investigated the Sandy Hook shooting and watched Cooper&#39;s venomous attack can plainly see through the emotional façade he puts up to cover his mission to divide, deride and discredit. Take a look, for where there&#39;s smoke, there&#39;s fire. For these media outlets to push out a campaign like this so zealously, and in concert then there must be some truth investigators have stumbled upon that they are trying to dissuade people from examining.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok, answer these questions then:</p>

<p>*why a video clip of adam just even entering the school hasnt been released? </p>

<p>*whats up with all the reports and police scanner clips of them clearly talking about multiple suspects? </p>

<p>*whats up with the shooters car being registered to a really shady guy? </p>

<p>*why did they say his mom was a teacher there when she wasnt? </p>

<p>*why did they say there was an incident between adam and the school when that didnt happen? </p>

<p>*why did a nurse who is not in any public records give an interview saying adams mom was a good teacher? </p>

<p>*why is there an interview with the principal after they said she was shot? </p>

<p>*if adam and his mom had no connection to the school- what was his motive? </p>

<p>*why so many inconsistencies with the guns used? how do you go from 2 handguns to 2 handguns and a rifle to 4 handguns and no rifle to 2 handguns a rifle and a shotgun in the trunk? really? that hard to count guns?</p>

<p>*why a huge push for gun control directly after this using this as the direct cause?</p>

<p>*why are all the people in this community and their interviews so odd?</p>

<p>*why have we only heard from a handful of victims? </p>

<p>*why hasnt anyone seen adam lanza in 3 years?</p>

<p>*why are there reports that no one knew who he was?</p>

<p>*why would he break his hard drive if he was going to kill his mom, teachers, kids and himself?</p>

<p>*why would he wear a mask and body armor if he was going to kill unarmed teachers/kids and then himself?</p>

<p>*why is the dead to wounded ratio so much different in this shooting than others?</p>

<p>*how is it possible for 1 untrained, small and presumably out of shape kid (they say he never left his basement) to shoot 26 people 3 to 11 times each which averages out to at least 182 rounds in such a short period of time with such an impressive kill rate?</p>

<p>anyone feel free to add to the list</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your response is fantastic. Sorry, I believe it was a hoax now! Your class and grasp of the English language has made me a believer.</p>

<p>What do I deserve by the way? Your ranting on like a lunatic, and I make you ill? </p>

<p>I care about the families, the kids, the parents and the relatives hurt by this horrible shooting. I do not wish any more harm on them. All the conspiracy theorists harassing these poor families make me want to puke.</p>

<p>You know what? I know the government does a lot of nasty, shady stuff, but you have to have balance. If your constantly thinking that everything is a hoax or shady, your going to drive yourself and everybody else around you nuts.</p>

<p>When you grow up , you may realize this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ahh, the classic, &#39;you dont capitalize so i dont have to hear what youre saying&#39; argument. you have just admitted you are lacking any reasonable ability to THINK. </p>

<p>when did i actually say what i thought happened? show me where? all i did was ASK QUESTIONS. that seems to have really gotten to you... why is that??? </p>

<p>i have not personally contacted any victims. if they choose to go onto a conspiracy forum and read about the incident, that is their choice. i am not responsible for the actions of other people. the actions of other people do not represent me or anyone but that individual. just because there are stupid people out there (on both sides) doesnt mean that the TRUTH should not be sought out. </p>

<p>also, i cant speak for other people (although i am sure many would agree) that i see TONS of other shootings on the news that i do not find suspicious. this one however, really didnt sit right. apparently, i was FAR from being alone. i trust my instincts and my instincts are telling me something isnt right. what it is? i dont know and i never said i did. however, i think if anyone truly cares about those 26 people and finding out the truth, we need to ask questions. if we ever live in a society where asking questions is looked down upon, we are no longer living in a free society.</p>

<p>there is a bigger picture in life. there are people who make decisions that you and i do not know about. i am not talking about space aliens or reptilian overlords. i am talking about people in power wanting to maintain their power. that has been around since the beginning of time. if you dont believe people are capable of doing horrible things, i suggest you open your eyes. if you dont think a ton of people arent capable of keeping a secret, i suggest you do some research. on that topic, people say that how could all of this been kept secret? well, if you know that if you publicly come out with information that your life would be in danger, you would most likely anonymously leak info... there seems to be a lot of interest in the case... a lot of information coming out... a lot of little mistakes being pointed out... so, maybe they didnt do that good of a job keeping a secret?</p>

<p>if you always buy what the media and government is selling you, you are going to be very surprised one day. look into history. understand that time is cyclical and history repeats itself. we are not immune to very shady happenings within our government. history has shown that our government has been responsible for TONS of very horrible things from tuskegee to agent orange to mkultra and the list goes on. maybe one day when you grow up, you will realize this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, you did not just &quot;ask&quot; questions. You had an answer to every single one of the questions you were asking, otherwise, why would you ask them?</p>

<p>Secondly, this &quot;truther&quot; story has reached a much bigger audience than other conspiracy theories, and the victims have been accosted by some people looking for answers, so the argument that if a few of them happen to read some forums...is bullshit.</p>

<p>My next question is, are you pro gun or a NRA member? Where do you live, in the southern United States? This might help explain your worry, and it might stem from the impending gun legislation.</p>

<p>As a Canadian, this is a long time coming for our brothers from the south. The gun culture in the United States is frightening to say the least!</p>

<p>Lastly, if you took the time to put aside your anger and actually read what I posted, you would see that I understand that there is things going on behind the scenes that have an impact on what goes on in our lives. I read conspiracy theories, news stories from our mainstream media, blogs and watch youtube videos, etc. I try to gather as much information on many topics that affect me and my family as possible. I just don&#39;t let the thought of a shadow regime ruin my everyday life. Shit, there are people out to get my position at work, and that&#39;s a small chunk of change, so I can imagine what people are doing for billions of dollars.I just don&#39;t let it it get me down. I have balance my friend, and that let&#39;s me live a life that I can enjoy without the anger that resides in your belly.</p>

<p>I hate CNN, it&#39;s bullshit, that&#39;s why I don&#39;t watch it.</p>

<p>What is your main source of news/information?</p>

<p>PS I also don&#39;t hide behind a number.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>*that is not true. you just didnt have a good answer. what you said is a way to deflect that. someone said, it might be you, that he didnt have a mask on. i said, ok good. that way we will see his face on video. i didnt claim to have the answer. you are creating a false argument.</p>

<p>*if there is something behind the scenes going on the public has a right to know because this incident was directly cited as a cause for new gun legislation which affects every american. so, because they choose to push that agenda, we now have a right to know all of the details behind the main incident they are using as justification. why wouldnt you want to know all the facts???</p>

<p>*i do not own a gun. i do not hunt and i never have hunted and never would. i find it disgusting. in fact, i am a vegan for 10 years. i live in the western US. i just happen to understand the REAL reason we have the 2nd amendment. i used to shoot when i was younger and i am pretty good with a shotgun. i would step up and defend the 2nd amendment if i felt it was in danger.</p>

<p>*youre canadian... now it makes sense. HA...</p>

<p>*i agree there is a serious problem with violence in the US and all over the world. however, guns dont cause the violence. poverty, corrupt politicians, mental health issues, breakdown in family structure, stupid religious disputes, etc.. cause violence. before guns, people used swords. before that, clubs. before that they smashed each others heads in with big rocks. dont tell me guns kill more people than other methods because the worst mass killings have been by arson and other means. we live in a violent world. every man has the right to defend himself.</p>

<p>*this isnt dominating my life and i dont see how you can draw that conclusion. i just think if there is something more to the story and this story is being used to push a political agenda, we really need to uncover the truth. </p>

<p>*my sources are every source i can find. from the mainstream stuff to the most whacked out ridiculous bullshit out there. the thing is, i dont believe everything i read. i try to figure out what is really going on. i think that a little bit of truth can be found basically anywhere, if you know how to look for it. </p>

<p>*dude, its a name on a website. who gives a shit. some people on here are meatstick6969... its just a silly name... the number i picked is just easy to remember on the keyboard... if that actually matters to you, i really dont know what to say... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s fine to be skeptical and ask questions. But just employ some common sense. Note: because a parent of a dead child is caught smiling and then collects himself and then gives a televised statement, that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s an actor. That is not healthy skepticism.

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with you on that. A smiling parent after the death of a child does not conclude the fact that they are an actor. But I think we can both agree that it doesn&#39;t fall into our expectations of how we assume they would act, or how we ourselves may act, and therefore it almost can&#39;t help but seem suspicious at first glance.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t go around crying 24/7 after they&#39;ve lost a family member. There aren&#39;t enough tears. There isn&#39;t enough emotional stamina for that.</p>

<p>Check out visitations at funeral homes. People run through a wide array of emotions. Someone will recall a fond memory and smile. Maybe even laugh and joke. Then a minute later snap back to the current and get overwhelmed with grief. </p>

<p>Add to that the surreal experience of having to go in front of a camera in the middle of all that. People get weirded out in all kinds of ways by TV cameras. They aren&#39;t themselves, even people who haven&#39;t been through an emotional wringer. You never know how they will react.</p>

<p>What you see is what you see. You make decisions on what appears right based on what you have observed throughout your life of observation. When you see someone who is in grief, it usually appears that they are holding back the grief and can at times smile at a story or memory of a lost loved one. But all in all they are in grief. It shows on their face at all times for a period. In this video it appears the exact opposite. The man appears to be jovial and happy in general, and has to conjure up a face of sadness. Its just what I see. When people start ignoring this and repeatedly making statements about how &quot;you never know how people will react in these situations&quot;, it strikes me as either very sheltered opinion, or outright deceptive. People in grief usually act in a similar fashion. And yes, I have witnessed this in my life enough to at least have an idea of it.</p>

<p>What is happening here is what I think is called &quot;begging the argument&quot;,. To introduce something which is not normally accepted or observed, and keep repeating it until it becomes at least partly accepted and then discussed as if it were accepted.</p>

<p>This is quite similar to what happened with the buildings on 911. At no time previous would anyone, without prodding and suggestion, have thought it normal that 3 buildings could collapse into their own footprint due to fire and non-catastrophic structural damage occurring in just 2 of the buildings. Yet, with enough repeating, it now becomes part of the dialogue. </p>

<p>None of your previous knowledge or observation counts for anything. Every situation can bring entirely random results and outcomes. Physics and human nature don´t exist. Next time, children running toward gunfire might be totally plausible, because you never know what someone will do in a stressful situation. It´s best just to trust the experts who can discern this totally crazy and random, scary world we live in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was with you right up until the point you said &quot;It´s best just to trust the experts who can discern this totally crazy and random, scary world we live in.&quot;</p>

<p>Some experts say that fire can indeed cause a building to collapse into it&#39;s footprint. Thousands of other experts say it cannot. Some experts say a child can not grow to be well adjusted with two same sex parents. Other experts say it indeed can.</p>

<p>The person that I will place my trust in to discern the events around me is myself. I will not give that power away to anyone else. I know myself better than I am able to know others, and if I am fearless, humble, and honest with myself, then I will always be steering myself towards the path that leads to truth, even when I inadvertently step off it.</p>

<p>No fact can be arrived at without first taking into account all possible information. However we often tend to side with one leaning or another. This is dangerous to do, as it can cause us to reject all available information in favor of information which allows us to feel the most comfortable. This is why divide and conquer works, because people stop thinking and become complacent when they are safe within their camps of comfort, and it applies to Red and Blue alike, to those who accept mainstream news, and to those who reject it.</p>

<p>So no, I will not place my trust in &quot;experts&quot; to dictate what my surroundings are. I will listen to their educated opinions, add them to my own, and be fearless enough to reject either should the information I gather require me to do so, regardless of whether or not I am comfortable in the conclusion. </p>
