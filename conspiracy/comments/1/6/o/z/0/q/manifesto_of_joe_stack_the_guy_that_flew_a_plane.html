        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Almost every media outlet labeled this man as &quot;insane&quot; or a &quot;nutjob&quot;. After reading his manifesto, I&#39;m left with the opposite impression:</p>

<hr/>

<p>If you’re reading this, you’re no doubt asking yourself, “Why did this have to happen?” The simple truth is that it is complicated and has been coming for a long time. The writing process, started many months ago, was intended to be therapy in the face of the looming realization that there isn’t enough therapy in the world that can fix what is really broken. Needless to say, this rant could fill volumes with example after example if I would let it. I find the process of writing it frustrating, tedious, and probably pointless… especially given my gross inability to gracefully articulate my thoughts in light of the storm raging in my head. Exactly what is therapeutic about that I’m not sure, but desperate times call for desperate measures.</p>

<p>We are all taught as children that without laws there would be no society, only anarchy. Sadly, starting at early ages we in this country have been brainwashed to believe that, in return for our dedication and service, our government stands for justice for all. We are further brainwashed to believe that there is freedom in this place, and that we should be ready to lay our lives down for the noble principals represented by its founding fathers. Remember? One of these was “no taxation without representation”. I have spent the total years of my adulthood unlearning that crap from only a few years of my childhood. These days anyone who really stands up for that principal is promptly labeled a “crackpot”, traitor and worse.</p>

<p>While very few working people would say they haven’t had their fair share of taxes (as can I), in my lifetime I can say with a great degree of certainty that there has never been a politician cast a vote on any matter with the likes of me or my interests in mind. Nor, for that matter, are they the least bit interested in me or anything I have to say.</p>

<p>Why is it that a handful of thugs and plunderers can commit unthinkable atrocities (and in the case of the GM executives, for scores of years) and when it’s time for their gravy train to crash under the weight of their gluttony and overwhelming stupidity, the force of the full federal government has no difficulty coming to their aid within days if not hours? Yet at the same time, the joke we call the American medical system, including the drug and insurance companies, are murdering tens of thousands of people a year and stealing from the corpses and victims they cripple, and this country’s leaders don’t see this as important as bailing out a few of their vile, rich cronies. Yet, the political “representatives” (thieves, liars, and self-serving scumbags is far more accurate) have endless time to sit around for year after year and debate the state of the “terrible health care problem”. It’s clear they see no crisis as long as the dead people don’t get in the way of their corporate profits rolling in.</p>

<p>And justice? You’ve got to be kidding!</p>

<p>How can any rational individual explain that white elephant conundrum in the middle of our tax system and, indeed, our entire legal system? Here we have a system that is, by far, too complicated for the brightest of the master scholars to understand. Yet, it mercilessly “holds accountable” its victims, claiming that they’re responsible for fully complying with laws not even the experts understand. The law “requires” a signature on the bottom of a tax filing; yet no one can say truthfully that they understand what they are signing; if that’s not “duress” than what is. If this is not the measure of a totalitarian regime, nothing is.</p>

<p>How did I get here?</p>

<p>My introduction to the real American nightmare starts back in the early ‘80s. Unfortunately after more than 16 years of school, somewhere along the line I picked up the absurd, pompous notion that I could read and understand plain English. Some friends introduced me to a group of people who were having ‘tax code’ readings and discussions. In particular, zeroed in on a section relating to the wonderful “exemptions” that make institutions like the vulgar, corrupt Catholic Church so incredibly wealthy. We carefully studied the law (with the help of some of the “best”, high-paid, experienced tax lawyers in the business), and then began to do exactly what the “big boys” were doing (except that we weren’t steeling from our congregation or lying to the government about our massive profits in the name of God). We took a great deal of care to make it all visible, following all of the rules, exactly the way the law said it was to be done.</p>

<p>The intent of this exercise and our efforts was to bring about a much-needed re-evaluation of the laws that allow the monsters of organized religion to make such a mockery of people who earn an honest living. However, this is where I learned that there are two “interpretations” for every law; one for the very rich, and one for the rest of us… Oh, and the monsters are the very ones making and enforcing the laws; the inquisition is still alive and well today in this country.</p>

<p>That little lesson in patriotism cost me $40,000+, 10 years of my life, and set my retirement plans back to 0. It made me realize for the first time that I live in a country with an ideology that is based on a total and complete lie. It also made me realize, not only how naive I had been, but also the incredible stupidity of the American public; that they buy, hook, line, and sinker, the crap about their “freedom”… and that they continue to do so with eyes closed in the face of overwhelming evidence and all that keeps happening in front of them.</p>

<p>Before even having to make a shaky recovery from the sting of the first lesson on what justice really means in this country (around 1984 after making my way through engineering school and still another five years of “paying my dues”), I felt I finally had to take a chance of launching my dream of becoming an independent engineer.</p>

<p>On the subjects of engineers and dreams of independence, I should digress somewhat to say that I’m sure that I inherited the fascination for creative problem solving from my father. I realized this at a very young age.</p>

<p>The significance of independence, however, came much later during my early years of college; at the age of 18 or 19 when I was living on my own as student in an apartment in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. My neighbor was an elderly retired woman (80+ seemed ancient to me at that age) who was the widowed wife of a retired steel worker. Her husband had worked all his life in the steel mills of central Pennsylvania with promises from big business and the union that, for his 30 years of service, he would have a pension and medical care to look forward to in his retirement. Instead he was one of the thousands who got nothing because the incompetent mill management and corrupt union (not to mention the government) raided their pension funds and stole their retirement. All she had was social security to live on.</p>

<p>In retrospect, the situation was laughable because here I was living on peanut butter and bread (or Ritz crackers when I could afford to splurge) for months at a time. When I got to know this poor figure and heard her story I felt worse for her plight than for my own (I, after all, I thought I had everything to in front of me). I was genuinely appalled at one point, as we exchanged stories and commiserated with each other over our situations, when she in her grandmotherly fashion tried to convince me that I would be “healthier” eating cat food (like her) rather than trying to get all my substance from peanut butter and bread. I couldn’t quite go there, but the impression was made. I decided that I didn’t trust big business to take care of me, and that I would take responsibility for my own future and myself.</p>

<p>During 1987, I spent close to $5000 of my ‘pocket change’, and at least 1000 hours of my time writing, printing, and mailing to any senator, congressman, governor, or slug that might listen; none did, and they universally treated me as if I was wasting their time. I spent countless hours on the L.A. freeways driving to meetings and any and all of the disorganized professional groups who were attempting to mount a campaign against this atrocity. This, only to discover that our efforts were being easily derailed by a few moles from the brokers who were just beginning to enjoy the windfall from the new declaration of their “freedom”. Oh, and don’t forget, for all of the time I was spending on this, I was loosing income that I couldn’t bill clients.</p>

<p>After months of struggling it had clearly gotten to be a futile exercise. The best we could get for all of our trouble is a pronouncement from an IRS mouthpiece that they weren’t going to enforce that provision (read harass engineers and scientists). This immediately proved to be a lie, and the mere existence of the regulation began to have its impact on my bottom line; this, of course, was the intended effect.</p>

<p>Again, rewind my retirement plans back to 0 and shift them into idle. If I had any sense, I clearly should have left abandoned engineering and never looked back.</p>

<p>Instead I got busy working 100-hour workweeks. Then came the L.A. depression of the early 1990s. Our leaders decided that they didn’t need the all of those extra Air Force bases they had in Southern California, so they were closed; just like that. The result was economic devastation in the region that rivaled the widely publicized Texas S&amp;L fiasco. However, because the government caused it, no one gave a shit about all of the young families who lost their homes or street after street of boarded up houses abandoned to the wealthy loan companies who received government funds to “shore up” their windfall. Again, I lost my retirement.</p>

<p>By this time, I’m thinking that it might be good for a change. Bye to California, I’ll try Austin for a while. So I moved, only to find out that this is a place with a highly inflated sense of self-importance and where damn little real engineering work is done. I’ve never experienced such a hard time finding work. The rates are 1/3 of what I was earning before the crash, because pay rates here are fixed by the three or four large companies in the area who are in collusion to drive down prices and wages… and this happens because the justice department is all on the take and doesn’t give a fuck about serving anyone or anything but themselves and their rich buddies.</p>

<p>To survive, I was forced to cannibalize my savings and retirement, the last of which was a small IRA. This came in a year with mammoth expenses and not a single dollar of income. I filed no return that year thinking that because I didn’t have any income there was no need. The sleazy government decided that they disagreed. But they didn’t notify me in time for me to launch a legal objection so when I attempted to get a protest filed with the court I was told I was no longer entitled to due process because the time to file ran out. Bend over for another $10,000 helping of justice.</p>

<p>So now we come to the present. After my experience with the CPA world, following the business crash I swore that I’d never enter another accountant’s office again. But here I am with a new marriage and a boatload of undocumented income, not to mention an expensive new business asset, a piano, which I had no idea how to handle. After considerable thought I decided that it would be irresponsible NOT to get professional help; a very big mistake.</p>

<p>This left me stuck in the middle of this disaster trying to defend transactions that have no relationship to anything tax-related (at least the tax-related transactions were poorly documented). Things I never knew anything about and things my wife had no clue would ever matter to anyone. The end result is… well, just look around.</p>

<p>I remember reading about the stock market crash before the “great” depression and how there were wealthy bankers and businessmen jumping out of windows when they realized they screwed up and lost everything. Isn’t it ironic how far we’ve come in 60 years in this country that they now know how to fix that little economic problem; they just steal from the middle class (who doesn’t have any say in it, elections are a joke) to cover their asses and it’s “business-as-usual”. Now when the wealthy fuck up, the poor get to die for the mistakes… isn’t that a clever, tidy solution.</p>

<p>As government agencies go, the FAA is often justifiably referred to as a tombstone agency, though they are hardly alone. The recent presidential puppet GW Bush and his cronies in their eight years certainly reinforced for all of us that this criticism rings equally true for all of the government. Nothing changes unless there is a body count (unless it is in the interest of the wealthy sows at the government trough). In a government full of hypocrites from top to bottom, life is as cheap as their lies and their self-serving laws.</p>

<p>I know I’m hardly the first one to decide I have had all I can stand. It has always been a myth that people have stopped dying for their freedom in this country, and it isn’t limited to the blacks, and poor immigrants. I know there have been countless before me and there are sure to be as many after. But I also know that by not adding my body to the count, I insure nothing will change. I choose to not keep looking over my shoulder at “big brother” while he strips my carcass, I choose not to ignore what is going on all around me, I choose not to pretend that business as usual won’t continue; I have just had enough.</p>

<p>I can only hope that the numbers quickly get too big to be white washed and ignored that the American zombies wake up and revolt; it will take nothing less. I would only hope that by striking a nerve that stimulates the inevitable double standard, knee-jerk government reaction that results in more stupid draconian restrictions people wake up and begin to see the pompous political thugs and their mindless minions for what they are. Sadly, though I spent my entire life trying to believe it wasn’t so, but violence not only is the answer, it is the only answer. The cruel joke is that the really big chunks of shit at the top have known this all along and have been laughing, at and using this awareness against, fools like me all along.</p>

<p>I saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different. I am finally ready to stop this insanity. Well, Mr. Big Brother IRS man, let’s try something different; take my pound of flesh and sleep well.</p>

<p>The communist creed: From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.</p>

<p>The capitalist creed: From each according to his gullibility, to each according to his greed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, his final move was indeed crazy. </p>

<p>Furthermore, I propose that romanticizing this guy (and consequently/unavoidably what he did) -- especially in this or similar communities -- only serves to associate the ideas we discuss with a sense of public threat or terror. OP: is this what you intend?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in Austin. I saw the smoke afterward from my office windows. I drove by the hole left in the building he hit daily. I remember reading his manifesto and thinking &quot;Wow, this guy really had a reason to be upset.&quot; It was far better written than I expected.</p>

<p>Then the next day the NYT or WP had an op-Ed which described his letter as profanity-laced rambling... Without linking or quoting what he wrote.  I remember getting pretty pissed at how it was spun and he was portrayed. I saw ONE article that acknowledged that tax law was truly unfair for this one specific occupation in that it presumed private software engineers were lying by default. The rest acted like he was just an angry nut job.</p>

<p>Having said that, I do not condone what he did at all. But I can understand just why he was uber frustrated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you didn&#39;t state in any way that his final act should be commended. Thanks for that, at least.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve thought some more about this, and despite he fact that I do perceive a MSM campaign afoot designed to portray conspiracy theorists as potential violent terrorists, and Joe Stack&#39;s story creepily fits in with that narrative, I now feel that we should not give in to the intended chilling effect on the conversation. </p>

<p>For the record, I think Joe Stack&#39;s calling out of the fucked-upness of the current plutocracy is mostly spot on, but the solution isn&#39;t further polarization, let alone flying a fucking plane into a building full of people, no matter who they are. </p>

<p>What happened to the whole &quot;that&#39;d make us no better than them/ we shouldn&#39;t lower ourselves to their level&quot; line of reasoning?</p>

<p>We need to keep cool, smart, and dare I say, peaceful if any progress is to be made. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the thoughts. No need to attack, though. I&#39;m just advocating peaceful, non-polarizing approaches, even though on some level I think the violent people in all camps should be shunned. </p>

<p>Watch Century of Self if you haven&#39;t, then tell me that this guy didn&#39;t perfectly fit Bernay&#39;s croneys&#39; perception of the masses as animals barely containing their violent impulses. The very same narrative used to justify ever tighter control. </p>

<p>To top it off, the establishment knows that we know that things are going on that we have a right to be angry about. They expect things to get ugly, and appear to have rigged the game to encourage this and yet <em>still</em> come out on top. We need to do the unexpected thing and fix things in a smart, peaceful way, whatever that might entail.</p>

<p>Btw, what makes you think I don&#39;t understand the plight of the working man?</p>

That&#39;s ridiculous. I grew up in a Quaker household, living in a cottage house as the caretakers of our Meeting House. Perhaps it&#39;s because I grew up around very different people that I know this statement to be false. Violent tendencies are bred into people. We are all just products of our environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just wanted to clarify: I pretty much agree with you on this point, with the exception of uncommon genetic abnormalities, etc. </p>

<p>The point Century of Self makes is that the whole &quot;all humans are barely contained beasts&quot; (which was used to justify the mass manipulation attempts we discuss here) was based on bogus Freudian theories and just being freaked out in general by WWII. </p>

<p>&quot;Why is it that a handful of thugs and plunderers can commit unthinkable atrocities (and in the case of the GM executives, for scores of years) and when it’s time for their gravy train to crash under the weight of their gluttony and overwhelming stupidity, the force of the full federal government has no difficulty coming to their aid within days if not hours? Yet at the same time, the joke we call the American medical system, including the drug and insurance companies, are murdering tens of thousands of people a year and stealing from the corpses and victims they cripple, and this country’s leaders don’t see this as important as bailing out a few of their vile, rich cronies. Yet, the political “representatives” (thieves, liars, and self-serving scumbags is far more accurate) have endless time to sit around for year after year and debate the state of the “terrible health care problem”. It’s clear they see no crisis as long as the dead people don’t get in the way of their corporate profits rolling in.&quot;</p>

<p>Relevant to recent gun control fights... and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;How can any rational individual explain that white elephant conundrum in the middle of our tax system and, indeed, our entire legal system? Here we have a system that is, by far, too complicated for the brightest of the master scholars to understand. Yet, it mercilessly “holds accountable” its victims, claiming that they’re responsible for fully complying with laws not even the experts understand. The law “requires” a signature on the bottom of a tax filing; yet no one can say truthfully that they understand what they are signing; if that’s not “duress” than what is. If this is not the measure of a totalitarian regime, nothing is.&quot;</p>

<p>Is so good...the whole damn thing is so good.</p>

<p>&quot;...I’ll try Austin for a while. So I moved, only to find out that this is a place with a highly inflated sense of self-importance...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I smiled when I read that because there&#39;s no greater way to describe Austin.</p>

<p>Also, OP, there&#39;s apparently a lot more to this, why didn&#39;t you post this?</p>

<p>Edit: I just checked the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Austin_suicide_attack">Wikipedia entry</a>. It seems that, as short as it is, the full text of his note is not included there. I wonder why. Would someone here familiar with editing Wikipedia please include it?</p>

<p>An additional $1,236,634 was spent on a security risk assessment to be performed by the private Georgia based logistical and engineering services firm Unified Consultants Group, Inc. A July 25, 2012 audit, released shortly after the indicent cost analysis, performed by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration determined that the contract was mismanaged by the IRS [45][46] The security review process was determined to have had multiple problems and many of the sites were not inspected by the contractor. The audit placed the blame on the IRS agency&#39;s individuals responsible for defining, negotiating, and administering the contract with potentially 100% of funds being used inefficiently and security improvements of IRS sites may not have been ineffective.[46]</p>

<p>Haha, just thought this was a little ironic. I think that&#39;s the word.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So damn sad. If he had posted this exact thing (minus the suicide part) he would be at 3000+ karma and someone would have given him reddit gold.</p>

<p>Instead, he&#39;s dead... And the only thing most people remember about him was that he&#39;s crazy.</p>

<p>For this, I&#39;m truly sorry Mr. Stack. I never read your story before now... And I feel ashamed. Being among the living, your words both inspire me and make me feel ashamed of my fellow countrymen. May your soul rest in peace. You were a martyr, but unfortunately a silent one. Your sacrifice meant a lot, but it wasn&#39;t enough, we&#39;re all still zombies. We&#39;re more asleep then we&#39;ve ever been, and the enemy is winning. I&#39;ll give you this though, you have my word. I&#39;ll fight to wake up everyone I know, on both the legacy of men like yourself and the countless others who have been lost fighting this machine.</p>

<p>Thanks for your part, I hope many others are as brave as you are. God knows we&#39;re gonna need &#39;em.</p>
