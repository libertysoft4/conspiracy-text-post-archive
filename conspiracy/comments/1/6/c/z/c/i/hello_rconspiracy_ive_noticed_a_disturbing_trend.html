        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello critical thinkers! I&#39;ve noticed a disturbing number of paid shills watching and attacking <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> lately. They will try and disrupt discussion and progress with personal attacks, irrelevant questions, mass downvotes and lies. I urge you all to trust your minds and think critically about everything that is said on this subreddit. Lets be alert and try to call out shills when possible, and I feel its important to read and give each comment and post fair judgement, ignoring downvote and upvote counts when necessary. Big brother is getting desperate and will try anything to silence or confuse us. We will not let their lies and distractions slow the exposition of truth! Even as I write this, I wonder if my post will even be seen before it is flooded with the mass downvotes the shills will surely bring. Stay strong and trust your minds. We are the future. Thank you, and good night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was wondering why a lot of the comments on this sub are attempting to debunk posts in such an offensive manner. This is r/conspiracy. I feel like this should be a group of like minded people working towards a greater good. Yes, some theories are a bit far fetched, but they are theories. If you want to be fed mass media &quot;truths&quot; you&#39;re in the wrong place. I don&#39;t understand why people have to be so hostile. Just an opinion. Downvotes to the left please!</p>

Newhouse at the top of their pyramid) It&#39;s time to leave Reddit en masse like we did Digg and go to free websites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shit, I thought about this just this morning.  Seriously considering it.  After the last two days where I was forced to defend Alex Jones of all people against baseless ad hominem attacks with absolutely zero substance.  I was up late and I could see the posts being created, upvoted, and seeded with &quot;conversation starters&quot; pointing in the intended direction.  Alex Jones is &quot;insane&quot;.  Every single post on reddit about the interview on Piers Morgan&#39;s show said so.  As the day went on and others started to back me up and point out the fact that these people were not actually making any argument, just name calling, and my faith in reddit returned.  But for a while there I was watching the wretched entrails of the beasts writhe and spew forth caustic lies and disparagement, and I felt helpless against the onslaught.  </p>

<p>And then the questioning, and the second-guessing of my perception started, but these people, whether &quot;real&quot; redditors being paid, or whole cloth fabrications invented to fill a role, they are vile and harmful. They spread lies and deception.  They attack without adding anything to the conversation.  They are parasites sucking from the lifeblood of our community for the profits of their corporate masters.  Call them on it.  Start a conversation about deception with them.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m leaving reddit, but I am emboldened to call these people out, if not for being shills, for their deceptive tactics.  Keep bringing the conversation back to the subject they are attempting to avoid and they will leave themselves or risk bringing too much attention to it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your candor. I am a Green Party-er and a progressive but this attack on our freedoms is beyond party lines. AJ&#39;s views on certain issues are abhorrent to me, but I put that aside because the global takeover with its totalitarian agenda is far more pressing than the everyday political issues we normally deal with. Personally I believe we can&#39;t win and I wish Alex would just pack up and get his family out of the country because it is clear the CIA black ops is going to kill him. They can&#39;t afford not to. The killings have already begun as I&#39;m sure you are aware of. Oh Alex&#39;s death will probably be staged to look like a suicide since TPTB are demonizing him and planting the idea in the public&#39;s minds  that he is crazy. I feel sick at the level of evil in the rotten heart of our government. And that is the problem. When Hitler was already putting his draconian policies into place, the German people (and the Jews) COULD NOT CONCEIVE that their countrymen could be capable of that level of evil. And of course, Hitler controlled the media so misinformation was all the Germans got. The end result was history. I am done with reddit and anyway it&#39;s clear that since Obama claimed the power to control all communictions when he announced martial law ( in one of his unbelievable Executive Orders last year, we&#39;re not going to have the internet when he lowers that velvet-gloved fist of his. What really makes me sick is that I voted for him in &#39;08. I wish you luck in the NWO.</p>

<p>This community exists for &quot;us&quot;, who like to discuss conspiracy. </p>

<p>This community is infested with &quot;them, who like to debunk all conspiracy. </p>

<p>The poster is speaking from the point of view a community member has, speaking to &quot;us&quot; about &quot;them&quot;.</p>

<p>It is interesting - I am a conspiracy tinfoil type, but very much agnostic (not edgy). </p>

<p>The presence of Christian Conspiracy theories is strange to me as well, given what I see as an obvious social control system.... and so on. They unmask all devils but their own...so to speak. </p>

<p>If you hang out on godlikeproductions (don&#39;t), you will see a real deluge of Christian Conspiracy...usually mixed with the most base and easily dismissed other theories, like Nibiru or Morgellons or whatever.</p>

<p>From a purely tinfoil angle, it seems to me that there has been an external push to make this board more like GLP - easily dismissed and almost utterly looney - of course this might just be due to the influx of more and more users to the site. </p>

<p>Or it could be the result of HBGary software forum sliding toward dismissible theory and a general attitude of &quot;they crazy&quot; instead of &quot;some of what they point out is creepy&quot;.</p>

<p>We used to discuss political chicanery here, almost 24/7. Now we talk about Ghosts and shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. We can&#39;t blindly accept every conspiracy at face value. Believers of a conspiracy should justify it with discussion and sources instead of replying with things like &quot;you just wouldn&#39;t understand&quot; or &quot;you need to wake up&quot; etc. </p>

<p>Just because it&#39;s a conspiracy doesn&#39;t mean that all conspiracies are created equally or that the burden of proof no longer applies. If there is absolutely no evidence of a conspiracy then Occam&#39;s razor applies and there probably isn&#39;t one. </p>

<p>We can&#39;t give crazy conspiracies equal footing as those that might be genuine, else it devalues things which are actually true. </p>

<p>We&#39;re not talking about that, or discrete wikipedia edits, or refutations of rumors. We&#39;re talking about &quot;They will try and disrupt discussion and progress with personal attacks, irrelevant questions, mass downvotes and lies.&quot;.</p>

<p>These are all things which further absolutely nothing. If the discussion is about company X doing bad deed Y, and it devolves into ad hominem attacks, no one is going to be convinced that X isn&#39;t doing Y. The rumor or story about X doing Y will still be the status quo, and they will have to do it all over again in every single discussion and article about it that pops up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily. If someone was talking about how something was handled within the company I work, I wouldn&#39;t expect someone from outside the company to know either the facts which I know, or find the evidence which I am able to find.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter who they are paid by if they are presenting evidence for something. For example, if a police officer had video taped someone stabbing a police officer, you wouldn&#39;t disregard the recording as evidence simply because it was presented by their colleague.</p>

<p>The same holds true with explanations, if they are verifiable. If it&#39;s just a matter of an accusation and then someone from that company replies to basically say &quot;nuh huh&quot;, then take either side as you see fit. However, if they say &quot;not possible because of X&quot;, and X is true, then once again it doesn&#39;t matter who is paying them, if what they are saying is correct.</p>

<p>The government and elitists know how much of a threat the internet is to their power structures which is why they want so badly to regulate it and control it, many sites have already been reigned in by different means to make it difficult for unsanctioned messages to go viral, like youtube with its sponsor policy drawing the masses into pop garbage videos and other group think tactics.</p>

<p>There are different models of control, some overt like that as in the novel &quot;1984&quot; (think North Korea) where the government actively censors media and some more complicated like that in &quot;A brave new world&quot; or &quot;Idiocracy&quot;.(think USA) where the public is bombarded with useless information and the government also partakes in a little censorship without the scrutiny or care of the apathetic masses. </p>

<p>Anyway my original point was supposed to be, ofcourse the government pays people to &quot;use&quot; the internet. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s relevant. We&#39;re talking about the likelihood of gov paying people to monitor and influence public discourse on the web, given the US&#39; history wit black projects, I dont see it farfetched at all if any number of US gov agencies from the CIA to FBI would partake in this.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a threat now, only you and I will ever see these comments (probably), if they were smart they would prioritize by what is most dangerous in terms of content and viewership. 
And if you stick around a while you&#39;ll notice that the most popular threads always get inundated by the same old trolls with the same old double think propaganda, especially threads critical of Israel or the US.</p>

<p>It looks to me like they&#39;re looking for incorrect copypasta-style facts. So, for instance, the argument that the Nazis disarmed the populace is being passed around on Facebook, when the Nazis never passed a gun control law and the gun registration in Germany predated the Nazi regime by nearly a decade. If there were an organized response, maybe that bullshit could get corrected. Especially when you&#39;re dealing with government-related policies and programs, this could be hugely useful. For instance, if more people <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2011/12/19-ndaa-wittes">knew what the 2012 NDAA actually did</a> then perhaps people wouldn&#39;t have wasted all that furor and all those electrons yelling about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with proof is that some people simply don&#39;t see it as such. If I see a man laughing and smirking before getting into character on television I see a ploy.

<p>He will tell me that the man is in shock at which point he has diffused my proof. Now how do you argue with a man that doesn&#39;t even believe his own eyes? You cannot, there is a fundamental difference among &quot;debunkers&quot; and conspiracy theorists and it is that one will do anything to prove that the world is entirely normal and ruled by non personal phenomena and the other which is trying to bring to the attention of the people that fact that many of these situations are indeed orchestrated.</p>

<p>You will never change a debunkers mind even with proof, and if you are experienced in this &quot;field&quot; you would know it yourself. 9/11 has shitloads of proof in my opinion yet none in the opinion of the debunker. So where do we stand on 9/11? Nowhere. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t burden us with having to play these debunker games. They only slow us down and change absolutly nothing in the end. We should converse among eachother and not give a fuck about the skeptics who are not skeptics but biased individuals cloaked as such.</p>

<p>And this attitude is what destroys the credibility of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

<p>You should assume <em>no-one</em> is a debunker, unless they prove otherwise, not the other way round. </p>

<p>If someone has a valid question or a differing opinion it does not make them a debunker, it gives you an opportunity to explain why you think what you think and provide evidence, if any. It&#39;s your opportunity to convince and convert someone to your way of thinking, which won&#39;t be achieved by ignoring them and dismissing people as &quot;debunkers&quot;. </p>

<p>You know this thing called free speech we&#39;re all trying so valiantly to protect... it allows people to have different opinions than you. To label someone who disagrees with you as a &quot;debunker&quot; is misinformation and dishonest. </p>

<p>I have had hundreds if not thousands of discussions with these people trying to make them see the proof but its just a waste of time and energy. Those who are open and see proof will know it others when presented with the same proof will shield from it, it is not up to us or me to crack down that shield and try to get that person to see the truth. Just as it is impossible to make an atheist see that there infact is more to life then the material. </p>

<p>It is not a question of proof, it is a question of the fundamental assumptions a person has. When a person holds dearly to his assumptions of the world and sees evidence to the contrary there are those that can start to perceive the world differently and there are those who will with all their might wiggle their way out.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t address this element from my comment. The element that proof is different for everybody. There is a 40 page report made on the illegal behaviours of government officials in terms of vaccination policies, yet present those papers to someone that calls anti vaccine people loons and they will dismiss the entire report.</p>

<p>I know when Im dealing with reasonable person and when not. In the end if like me you have put out so much energy into these people you start to understand that there are people who act very logically and portray themselves as healthy skeptics but are infact incredibly biased and closed of.</p>

<p>Given your examples, maybe you don&#39;t. I wouldn&#39;t call the person in your scenario a &quot;debunker&quot; at all. </p>

<p>Howver, you&#39;re right that the definition of proof is different for everyone. Some people have lower standards of proof than others. </p>

<p>For instance, using your previous example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I see a man laughing and smirking before getting into character on television I see a ploy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve seen a video of a single moment that&#39;s taken out of context. You don&#39;t know what was being said before or how a man reacts in given situations like when he&#39;s grieving or anxious. Have you never felt like laughing at inappropriate moments like a funeral?</p>

<p>However, you&#39;ve accepted that as cast iron proof that the guy&#39;s an actor. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not unreasonable for rational people to ask for a little more evidence before jumping to conclusions. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He will tell me that the man is in shock at which point he has diffused my proof.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is a more likely explanation than the guy being a paid actor in a pantomime put on by the government to sway public opinion and steal their liberties as protected by the constitution. </p>

<p>Instead of labeling that person a &quot;debunker&quot; engage them in a conversation, giving them a different perspective, and <em>offer more evidence</em>. </p>

<p>If there is no more evidence, then maybe <em>you&#39;re the one that&#39;s wrong</em>. And that&#39;s a question which you should ask yourself regularly. </p>

<p>Skepticism is healthy for a conspiracy theory subreddit and should be encouraged. If theorists can&#39;t justify themselves it shouldn&#39;t be a theory. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We as a group are not burdened with convicning the entire world. Its not up to us, we are here and we will always be here. It is up to the otherside to come to realization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then why post? If it&#39;s enough for you that you personally know, why bother posting to tell other people?</p>

<p>If everyone had that attitude then no conspiracies would be uncovered at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unrelated to the dude you were talking to, but I have some thoughts to add to the mix.</p>

<p>I think it is more about the mindset of &quot;debunking&quot;, and this is something that we can&#39;t really point out or show evidence of outside of this discussion.</p>

<p>Let us just suppose there is a kind of person who enjoys &quot;debunking&quot;. They will see debunkery where the wish to, just as a conspiracy person may see conspiracy. </p>

<p>The issue then becomes: what is this subreddit for? It is for those who enjoy entertaining crazy, far reaching conspiratorial ideas? Or is it for those who enjoy proving those theories incorrect? </p>

<p>There is a large difference between a discussion between two conspiracy people who disagree, and a conspiracy person and a debunker. </p>

<p>For example, I don&#39;t think contrails are real. A lot of people do. Rather than tell them they are wrong, or try to best them at argument online, I use the opportunity to ask pertinent questions about their beliefs, so I can better understand them. This is essentially my approach to religious people as well. </p>

<p>Have you objectively/independently verified you were right every time?</p>

<p>For a while when I was younger I thought you could easily tell something about someone&#39;s personality by the way they looked. I&#39;d see someone I regarded as &quot;bad&quot; and see them maybe not hold a door for someone that they conceivable could have, and that goes to add weight to my theory. I never spoke to these people, I never saw them in any other situation, on any other day, but I was convinced because of the evidence I saw. Confirmation bias, as it&#39;s known.</p>

<p>This might be why your &quot;proof&quot; is often disregarded by a third party. The human brain isn&#39;t as rational as it should be. People see things that they want to see, things that confirm what they believe and so on. If you already believe that there is a mass media conspiracy regarding X, and you see the news anchor laugh before presenting the story, you&#39;ll naturally take that as evidence you&#39;re right. That&#39;s working on the assumption that you are already correct about the conspiracy however, because on it&#39;s own without the pre-existing theory, that alone is evidence is exactly nothing.</p>

<p>Thats exactly what I said. I know people can be different from what they appear to be. But none the less there is a pattern, a way of thinking that is closed of. And I don&#39;t claim to know all infact the more I search the less I know. But atleast I&#39;m open and being scolded for that openens being rediculed to go in thought where none dare go is enough for me to put you (not you persé) in that catagory of people no time should be spent on.</p>

<p>Even though I am defening the conspiracy movement I do not identify with it. Truth to me lies else where. It lies not in intellect for the intellect is a tool constrained by subjectivity and as long as there is that there is no truth. I am aware that by generalizing and catagorizing and judging I am indeed working from a fictional construct. But I need to use my energy efficiently and knowing when you are going to make a difference in a persons mind and when not is important. </p>

<p>Those who have a mind ready will accept the water given, those who&#39;s mind is solid will reject the water. And in this analogy the preparetion of a mind to become softened is not something to be done from outside (other people). It is a process that happens inside (self). This is something nobody can help with.</p>

<p>I recognize that you speak alot of truth and are wise, take care.</p>

When someone disagrees with an idea in other places then its just a difference in opinion or perspective, we may think that they are wrong but at the end of the day its just a disagreement.  When it comes to r/conspiracy though its not just a mere difference of opinion, it turns the person who disagrees into some &quot;agent of disinformation&quot; or &quot;paid shills&quot;, they always have an ulterior motive to silence discussion.  I find this pretty silly because it speaks to an idea of inflated self-importance, believe it or not in reality this is just another sub on Reddit and its not even one of the most populated, its not actually all that influential to the greater society as a whole so guess what, the government or corporations dont give a shit what people say here, in fact its very existence shows that nobody really cares.  You can talk about the Illuminati, suicide pills, bilderberg group or all of the other topics that get discussed here all you want and nobody is going to silence you, but one thing you will find are plenty of people who disagree and nobody needs to be on a payroll for that to be the case.  This is why I find it kinda funny that the term free thinkers is used to describe the many people who visit this sub because it seems extremely closed minded to have a reactionary response that when people disagree with you they must be part of some larger machine determined to crush you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t brought up any issues, you don&#39;t know if I am biased towards anything at all. I&#39;m just saying that it is detrimental for legitimate discussion if we pretend truly ridiculous topics merit our time and effort. If someone wants to make a case for something ridiculous, that&#39;s there problem, but there are so many other much more legitimate topics out there that we could be focusing on instead. See, people could potentially embrace a ridiculous topic, make it look as silly at it actually is. Your legitimate topic is that much less legitimate if people are arguing for the ridiculous.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying, if you want legitimate discussion, you can&#39;t worry about people&#39;s feelings (which is the only reason a truly ridiculous topic would ever not be ridiculed). Now determining what makes a legitimate topic and what makes a ridiculous topic is a completely other issue.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well no shit, if I take my time and independently find a topic to be ridiculous, then that&#39;s my opinion of it! It&#39;s like saying 2 = 2, if I find something to be ridiculous, then, for me, it&#39;s ridiculous!</p>

<p>Now that I found something to be ridiculous, using my critical thinking skills as best as I could, I would want others to realize how ridiculous it is as well, lest someone actually decides to take it seriously. That&#39;s what I meant by ridicule the ridiculous. If you see something you found to be ridiculous, a detriment to a legitimate discussion, or just plainly a negative force in the world, it is your duty to try get people away from that path!</p>

<p>Whether or not you are right in determining something as a ridiculous or legitimate topic is a whole other matter. However, if you trust your own critical thinking skills (which people usually do), then you should go out of your way to show how little merit the topic actually has. Maybe your critical thinking skills were flawed, to which I would say that you should keep an open and skeptical mind and etc. etc. That&#39;s another topic. All I know is that if you come across something retarded, don&#39;t let it get away with being on par with real topics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sometime I feel like the people on this sub are oblivious to reality, heres my argument broken down.</p>

<p>1) most posters on this sub dont use legitimate evidence, they use many assumptions on &quot;predictions&quot;.  Ie you try to sound scientific or professional...but your usually a person with little expertise in the field that you base your conspiracy on.  Like how many actually know about how the economy works and what the roots of your &#39;traditional&quot; or passed down conspiracy theory is based on? p.s i have my own c. theories on things; which are backed up by my degrees in science and chem, I dont belivie in the NWO because its a undeveloped assumption; moreover all of the  theorist of the NWO or illumanti are in these (any or all) groups christian, stoners ,drop out, no girlfriend, ex- Christians, video game addicts, fatansy lover, and soforth along that path, and this is why you may find sub redditts such as <a href="/r/conspiratroll">/r/conspiratroll</a> or <a href="/r/conspiratardmake">/r/conspiratardmake</a> these  sound more like propagandist try to instill fear in us. </p>

<p>final statement wikileaks has legitimized themselves by solid fact based evidence, such a stolen government documents, maybe we can learn a thing or two fro journalist fighting against censorship. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because someone is disagreeing with you doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re being targeted by the powers that be. I&#39;m new to conspiracy and many of my comments have been disagreeing with people or playing the devil&#39;s advocate, not to disrupt the discussion or piss them off, but because debate fosters the best discussion. Our conspiracy beliefs are all different, ranging from only believing there&#39;s something someone&#39;s hiding something about the recent mass shootings to full on believing that lizard people run the earth in secret. The best way anyone is going to be able to express their beliefs is going to be defending them from a nonbeliever, and in the process both parties are likely to gain some understanding that may shift their views.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the biggest problem with conspiracy theorists really, that when anything goes against us at all, someone&#39;s going to blame it on big brother. If there are paid shills here they&#39;re doing a terrible job, one man alone could easily wreak havoc. Basically just don&#39;t cry wolf, or nobody will give us a second look if or when the site is actual absolutely flooded by shills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay I haven&#39;t done much research on the reptile thing. I watched a couple videos and they kept showing when Bush &amp;amp; the Royal family blinked how you could see they were reptiles. I honestly didn&#39;t see anything. Now I am a very open minded person. I also think most conspiracies are connected. Any good movies or something I can watch that explains this reptile theory?</p>

<p>Edit-seriously fuck this sub. I ask a simple honest question and people downvote me. Jokes on you. I give zero fucks about karma. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that and I&#39;m all for critical thinking, it&#39;s just the wording comes off very strong. For example, after saying hello you immediately jump into &quot;I&#39;ve noticed a disturbing number of paid shills watching and attacking <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> lately.&quot; If you think it&#39;s plausible that we could be under attack try first mentioning the downvotes and disruption, then explain why our community would be worth attacking and who would benefit, then finally conclude with the claim that you think we&#39;re under attack. When you come at someone full force you&#39;re likely to just come off as crazy like alex jones did on piers morgan. If you want to truly convince a non-believer, you have to ease them through the logic steps slowly, at least until your take their conspiracy-virginity and their eyes are open enough to stop blindly believing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve posted something similar to this as well.  But what I find odd is why some stories which are clearly fact driven and pulled from headlines are being posted into <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  Then the crazy stories which have a true conspiracy twist to them and seems to be mostly opinion of the writer are posted in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.   I truly believe censorship and manipulation is abound on this site.  Just like other sites. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s run amok or anything but I notice several instances each week.  It&#39;s kind of annoying in a childish way but I just chalk it up to immaturity and a failure to have basic understanding of social media.  Then again maybe I just think too much!!</p>

<p>What everyone apparently fails to realize is that we, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> subscribers, are exactly the audience companies/goverment/organizations <em>aren&#39;t</em> trying to influence. We aren&#39;t nearly as susceptible to the propaganda, and we have our minds pretty much made up about how we feel about a particular issue, that the effort would be wasted compared to shilling in more neutral areas of the internet.</p>

<p>The point to my comment was that this subreddit is the last place a paid shill would go to spread misinformation, yet everyone accuses everyone of being a shill if they disagree with their conspiracy. TRUST ME, no one of the 102,448 subscribers to this sub are getting paid to post here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there are shills on here, I believe they are more subtle and subversive than <a href="/u/glassonglass">/u/glassonglass</a> suggests: that is to say, I suspect the real shills are the ones who post crazy, illogical items that are inexplicably upvoted into the stratosphere by virtual shills.</p>

<p>I am only a casual observer of this subreddit these days, but I feel that the overall quality of highly upvoted posts has gone down significantly over the last few months. Posts on the front page are either circlejerk images or conspiracies with the most tenuous of claims. As a skeptic with regard to most conspiracy theories I&#39;d say that most items that get posted on here are so outlandish and unsupported by any evidence that they do not merit much thought.</p>

<p>An even more subversive type of shilling is one where there may be a genuine conspiracy but then the proponents go a few steps too far into making unnecessary assertions that are highly questionable. I&#39;ll cite what may turn out to be an unpopular example: 9/11.</p>

<p>There are frightening connections between the Bush family and the Bin Laden family. There&#39;s significant proof that Al Quaeda was either tiny or possibly didn&#39;t even exist in the way that most Americans think it did. Some people made huge amounts of money that day, and it appeared that some people may have been warned. There were suspicious military exercises going on that day that led to a perfect storm of non-response on the part of the US defense. But guess what, a lot of 9/11 stuff I see tailspins into pointless debates about whether or not the buildings were taken down by planes or bombs.</p>

<p>Without going into detail, I&#39;ll state that I am in the &quot;planes were used on the WTC&quot; camp. But that&#39;s not my point and please don&#39;t get distracted by that - from the perspective of caring about and investigating a &#39;conspiracy&#39;, <strong>you should not care whether it was planes or bombs</strong>. What you should care about is the political and financial ties between the major players involved in 9/11, and who stood to benefit the most. Some people who benefitted may have just gotten lucky, but there&#39;s an awful lot of coincidences that suggest that at least some of the parties in question may in fact have colluded.</p>

<p>On the subject of skepticism, I&#39;m a big believer that most &#39;conspiracies&#39; that people think exist are accidental or unintentional. The Hermany/Chomsky classic <em>Manufacturing Consent</em> is a fantastic study and analysis of what I&#39;m talking about. It appeared that several parties were engaging in a conspiracy related to the US role in Latin America in the 70s when they were most likely just acting in their own self interest in a way that happened to be mutually beneficial. I also think that the few real conspiracies that have existed have been rather short term as they have a tendency to implode messily after taking a stab or two at their initial goals (e.g., the various Illuminati groups in the late 1700s). IMO the people &quot;in control&quot; are generally too disorganized and ineffectual to actually pull off a full blown conspiracy.</p>

<p>One last thing - criticism of propaganda and lies is frequently conflated with &#39;conspiracy&#39; in this subreddit. It should not be a surprise that some politicians and some big corporations lie. Once a fairly substantial minority of the populace is aware of the issue it&#39;s not much of a conspiracy. I&#39;m on here because I am interested in theories about elaborate schemes involving multiple actors pulling the strings of their Government and corporate lackeys. Energy companies lying about fracking, big tobacco lying about lung cancer, and the tea party pretending it&#39;s not shilling for the Koch brothers isn&#39;t a conspiracy, it&#39;s depressing business as usual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO we should quit with this whole &#39;shill&#39; nonsense, it&#39;s just silly. While there may intact be shills here, I wont dispute, the term is now just a joke thrown about as if it even still has any meaning. 
Especially since the huge majority of people called shills are just people disagreeing, asking for sources, or simply trolling.</p>

<p>Quit mistaking &#39;shills&#39; and &#39;trolls&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a regular reader at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, though I wouldn&#39;t describe myself as a conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>I essentially disagree with a lot of what I read here. That said, I find it interesting and valuable to see what people are worrying about. After all, sometimes there really are conspiracies, and working as a (TV) journalist it&#39;s my job to unpick them and find out what&#39;s really going on. This is the kind of place where I might pick up leads.</p>

<p>My perspective on this &#39;paid shills&#39; issue, as a relative outsider, is that what you&#39;re seeing aren&#39;t people sent here to suppress anything- but rather people who simply disagree, or have a general disdain for conspiracy theories in general.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is not a closed community, so it shouldn&#39;t surprise you when people with radically different ways of thinking post here. You already know that you&#39;re in the minority, so it shouldn&#39;t be a surprise when someone posts something at odds with the general community sentiment.</p>

<p>I think to jump to the conclusion that these people are &#39;paid shills&#39; is pretty radical. You should welcome the opportunity to test theories and weigh up evidence against the views of those who disagree, without dismissing them out of hand because of an assumption that you make about their motives. Maybe outsiders could be of use to the community, it&#39;s hard to examine ideas with a narrow perspective, and there are a lot of like-minded people here.</p>

<p>They&#39;re probably just looking for a rise, so don&#39;t respond in anger- or by &#39;calling them out&#39; (labelling them with no prima facie reason), engage them.</p>

<p>Think of it as an opportunity to reach an audience that would normally be outside of the echo-chamber of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, don&#39;t anathematize all dissenting voices. Isn&#39;t the suppression of dissenting voices something we all abhor?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also I&#39;m not sure if you can search these usernames, but there was at one time jackboot IDF ultra Zionists that moderated for r/conspiritard. u/Nolibs and u/ghostofnolibs. Most likely the same user with sockpuppet. He was raging in a sub he created thinking no one could see that he was writing twisted degenerate songs about Rachel Corrie being ran over by a Zionist bulldozer. I believe one of them was about Rachel Corrie pancakes. They were able to convince their adjuncts it was a silly joke, but no it was an inside joke that is still whispered in r/conspiritard to this day in certain Hasbara circles. I would rather get waterboarded than be associated with scumbags like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Asking for evidence isn&#39;t causing a disruption nor is asking for evidence.  Furthermore it isn&#39;t a lie nor does it make someone a shill when they provide evidence that proves something incorrect.</p>

<p>For example - you can get lots of upvotes for asking for pictures of the Sandy Hook funerals but if you dare post any pictures you are attached.  </p>

<p>The future belongs to those who can adapt and respond to changing information - it doesn&#39;t belong to those who know they are right and who refuse to allow differing information to be talked about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its kinda funny reading this, not because of you, but this discussion is the the very reason I don&#39;t bother with any conspiracy sites.</p>

<p>Most of these people are fantasists they are playing the  X-Files real life RPG, they don&#39;t care about truth they care about being &quot;right&quot;. About being the cool guy that knows all the stuff, you know Kevin Smith in that shitty Die Hard 4 movie? THAT GUY! (It wouldn&#39;t be an issue if &quot;that guy&quot; wasn&#39;t fictional I guess)</p>

<p>That&#39;s why asking for things like logic &amp; evidence makes you a shill, and even then, what would half of these gimps do if they actually did find something? We already all know the answer to that don&#39;t we!? Same as they&#39;ve always done, NOTHING</p>

<p>Conspiracy sites nowadays either by accident or by design are basically Facebook for people with no friends! (in terms of worthwhile content at least)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously, it makes Reddit a whole new world.  When you see what you are pretty sure is a shill, copy and paste the &#39;best&#39; part of their comment into their tag field.  Color-code it a chosen color to denote what you did, then just sit back and do your Reddit thing.  The shills will paint themselves into a corner very quickly <em>by their behavior alone</em>.  You don&#39;t even need to interact with them directly, just observe their character.  It sure makes the downvotes easier.  :)</p>

<p>(Cue a pile of shills to come insult me now for this very good advice.  Call it a practice round for those new to the tagging concept.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i have been lurking here awhile and at first i thought . hmmm they might have something here. then as time went on I started thinking about it  and this is what i came up with. one important question I never see asked in this subreddit or with most conspiracy crowds is this, WHY? why do it this way when there are so many eaiser ways to do it? This post for instance. Why are there shills in abundance? Does this subreddit hold enough importance to discount? most people consider conspiracy  nuts to be just that nuts. Why would they care enough to discredit you? In conclusion, im not discounting anything said in this post or any other, just ask yourself why before you jump on the bandwagon. ( I now go to be downvoted to oblivion.)</p>

<p>Yes. After the majority of reddit figured out that r/politics is completely staged they came here. </p>

<p>There is a very clear push to make r/conspiracy more like GLP and less like OWS. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>People asked for <strong>specific evidence of paid shills on this subreddit</strong> and you replied with a link to wikipedia that links to unsourced blog posts. Those links are not evidence, much less proof of the claims being made in this thread, hence why its a non sequitur.</p>

<p>The problem with your &#39;evidence&#39; is that if you accept it, it leaves you with no ability whatsoever to distinguish between a &#39;paid shill&#39; and someone who&#39;s merely not convinced of your argument.</p>

<p>With such a mentality you&#39;re likely to conclude anyone and everyone who disagrees with you is a paid shill, which is plainly absurd.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand your use of self-fulfilling prophecy...I was perhaps being sarcastic, but I am not sure how prophecy fits here. </p>

<p>Please supply me with <strong>specific evidence</strong> that we landed on the moon, that the earth is round, that God is or is not real, or that the sun is nuclear and not just a hot ball of fire. </p>

<p>My point is that &quot;asking for specific evidence&quot;, in the case of philosophical, thought-based conjecture and theory, is stupid. </p>

<p>Yes, that is in fact the exact problem. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t conclude that, so don&#39;t assume I do. </p>

<p>For instance, I am fairly certain you are a real person. In fact, a lot of real people disagree with me, all the time. I can&#39;t even start to guess at who is &quot;real&quot; or not. Heck - maybe sometimes the people who are <em>agreeing</em> with me are the shills?!</p>

<p>The point is that we have evidence that the system is gamed, so it is not a stretch of the imagination to claim that the system is gamed. </p>

<p>A hilarious and cheap side effect of all this possible shilling, just as you pointed out, is that the community no longer trusts each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given the number of Reddit readers and subscribers, I think to doubt that this is happening is astronomically naive. And it&#39;s not just r/conspiracy.  Reddit is also a viral marketer&#39;s playground.  In an environment where more than a few dozen people can&#39;t gather without someone seeing it as an opportunity to push ads in their faces, no one should be even remotely surprised at this.  One can&#39;t even lay on the beach without someone hiring tow planes to fly banner ads all day.  </p>

<p>If I was charged with turning/controlling/shaping public opinion on literally anything, I&#39;d have a whole room full of people (with signed non-disclosure agreements) scouring social media with conjured personas manipulating the paid agenda whenever and wherever it happens to pop up. And that would be way less expensive than a MSM PR campaign. </p>

<p>Any evidence they are paid shills? I mean more than your word.  I doubt it because quite frankly there is none.</p>

<p><em>&quot;They will try and disrupt discussion and progress with personal attacks, irrelevant questions, mass downvotes and lies.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Really? I usually see this with Conspiracy believers downvoting those who disagree with their assessment.  Even if you&#39;re right they are probably just trolls not &quot;paid government shills&quot; trying to spread disinformation.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Big brother is getting desperate and will try anything to silence or confuse us. We will not let their lies and distractions slow the exposition of truth!&quot;</em></p>

<p>As another poster said the &quot;truth&quot; varies between being suspicious of the integrity of bankers (Like I am) and believing Reptile men from Nibiru that eat babies are secretly ruling the planet. </p>

<p>There is no Illuminati conspiracy.  There is no New World Order.  There are only a bunch of incompetent bastards fucking up on a daily basis. How do I know this? Because humans are all fucking incompetent.  For God sakes Richard Nixon the <strong>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES</strong> could not cover up a breakin at an office building, and you think people are ruling the world?  Sorry but it&#39;s bullshit.  I&#39;d advise you to use your time with meaningful things (There&#39;s plenty of poverty in the U.S.) or even possible conspiricies (The LIBOR scandel is a serious issue).  This New World Order Governments out to get me bullshit is distracting people from ACTUAL issues.</p>

<p>Occam&#39;s Razor 
&quot;when you have two competing theories that make exactly the same predictions, the simpler one is the better.&quot; </p>

<p>Now in this case the &quot;prediction&quot; would be that the world has fucked up things happen in it every day.  Now which theory sounds more plausible</p>

<p><strong>New World Order</strong>
A cabal of elite bankers and Zionists (AKA: Jews) have formed a centuries long group with the end goal being complete control of the world.  Said people orchestrate false flag attacks, bombings, and economic crisis in order to further facilitate their goal of world domination.  People really have no power in their government and everything is run by a very few individuals in secret societies.  (Note this theory can involve: Lizard People, Nibiru, Chemtrails, UFO&#39;s, Roswell, Government Shills, Bio terrorism, Anti Semitism, and all manner of other things)</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p><strong>My version of events</strong>
The world is a chaotic place with lots of incompetent and stupid people.  There is no group controlling world events due to the complex nature of our system. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a negative, I just used language to frame it as a negative.  To frame it as a positive would take a lot more words.  In more words I might ask for evidence for the fact that certain events or historical facts or whatever we see as the outward signs which some take to be the results of conspiracy are actually instead the result of incompetence, happenstance and self interest on the part of unconnected parties.</p>

<p>But, with that said, I should exasperatedly ask you, you don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to produce evidence of a negative?  What do you think billions of dollars were spent for in constructing the CERN installation for example?  It was, among other things, so that the existence of the Higgs boson could be proved or disproved with some amount of certitude.  A positive or negative result to so many standard deviations would prove to the satisfaction of most that it either did or didn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>Why do you think you can&#39;t have evidence of a negative?  You can have a logically consistent thesis which has certain observable physical characteristics and you can watch for them and if you see them, if you&#39;re clever enough in your question, you can prove to some degree of certainty that it exists and if you have good reason to expect those characteristics and you don&#39;t observe them you can be as certain that it doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>The history of science is full of examples of evidence proving a negative, the aether, phlogiston, etc.  That&#39;s not how it works?  How does it work? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going go down some epistemological rabbit warren here but we can&#39;t be sure that we can <em>prove</em> anything objectively but there are certain criteria and standards that we can agree on which constitute something approaching proof and we can look for it either way, whether we test for a positive or a negative.  It&#39;s also a philosophical question as to what the status quo or null is which we hold as the default which must be disproved rather than the alternative which challenges it.  </p>

<p>But you&#39;re right, for most of us, myself included, the null hypothesis in this and most cases is that nothing is going on, there is no conspiracy, and some tests would have to be constructed to challenge that status quo assumption to some degree of certainty in order to reject the null and then replace it with the alternative.  The burden of proof is on those challenging the null, but the null isn&#39;t written in stone and which side occupies the null is at root a question of philosophy, a different school of thought or other culture etc. might pose the question the opposite way.  To be clear however I agree, the null should be nothing is going on.  But, sometimes the null is that something <em>is</em> going on and we have to prove that it isn&#39;t depending on the question.</p>

<p>It&#39;s often a good idea to keep this in mind and even when one side is firmly in the status quo and reframe it so that it&#39;s not; if you&#39;re position is strong it will only be made stronger, if it&#39;s mostly rightly but tenuously this might reveal some important detail to improve it, and if it&#39;s wrong then it&#39;s overturned.  And of course it&#39;s possible to prove a negative, in so far as we define proof, it&#39;s actually no different than proving a positive.  An assertion is made, that statement can be framed in a positive or negative way, it&#39;s tested, results observed and computed and the assertion is either supported or it isn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but there has been a big increase in the frequency of the attacks recently.  Good posts get down voted so they&#39;re never seen by most casual browsers of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.   (The Paul Craig Roberts blog post on the agenda driven news cycle, for instance   <a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2012/12/28/agenda-prevails-over-truth/">http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2012/12/28/agenda-prevails-over-truth/</a>).</p>

<p>Even posts in other sub-Reddits are being down voted if they even hint at a view that the government or authority figures would rather not see or respond to.   (There was a post by a cop that accused a redditor of &quot;overthinking&quot; when he suggested that the role of the police was to serve as enforcers for the status quo or armed thugs for the rich and powerful for anyone that would complain about massive inequality and myths of opportunity for the poor and the middle class.   Remember the retired Philidelphia Police Captain that was arrested at the New York OWS gathering  -overthinking suggested by a low level cop as opposed to a thoughtful analysis by someone is a position to KNOW.   <a href="http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/161545/retired-philadelphia-police-captain-ray-lewis-arrested-at-ows-calls-nypd-rationale-a-farce/">http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/161545/retired-philadelphia-police-captain-ray-lewis-arrested-at-ows-calls-nypd-rationale-a-farce/</a></p>

<p>There is definitely a concerted effort being made to control the narrative of current events and government policy in this sub Reddit as well as on other sub-Reddits.</p>

<p>We&#39;re in a war with those that would have you forget real history and would instead force the corporate media&#39;s version of the truth on you.  They are constantly rewriting history for their benefit.</p>

<p>There is definitely a down vote brigade at work that started really ramping up their efforts within the last month.</p>

<p>Taking the chemtrails claim as a central theory, there are people who believe that spraying vinegar somehow breaks up a chemtrail 30,000 feet over their heads. Are they chemtrail conspiracy theorists, or are they shills?</p>

<p>Others believe in &quot;slyphs&quot;, or air elementals which somehow disrupt chemtrails. Are they chemtrail conspiracy theorists, or are they shills?</p>

<p>A yet third group, believe that they have a disease called Morgellons, spread by chemtrails, and that that is what chemtrails are used for.</p>

<p>Now imagine someone posts a chemtrail story which uses geoengineering as an explanation for the purpose of why they exist.</p>

<p>If a vinegar-sprayer, sylph-believer or Morgellons person sees the story, are they going to automatically agree with it, or could they consider it to be &quot;disinfo&quot;, because it&#39;s not compatible with their own personal reasoning for chemtrails?</p>

<p>Just something to think about.</p>

<p>Agree!</p>

<p>Again, I agree.</p>

<p>But I try to ask polite questions instead of just attacking those I think are living in a reality different from mine. I guess I just want the same level of respect from everyone on this board.</p>

I urge you all to pile on to whatever comments the OP doesn&#39;t agree with, and to accuse them of being paid shills. Only this way will the forum be secure for the dissemination of everything the OP agrees with, and safe from people the OP doesn&#39;t agree with (ie, paid shills).</p>

<p>I think the more we get into the vetting mindset the more we&#39;d be taken seriously and the better &#39;pull&#39; we&#39;d have with other subreddits. </p>

<p>Ultimately I&#39;d love to see posts in <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> like <em>&quot;yeah, this politician&#39;s linked with this controversy, check out r/conspiracies vetting post on it.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Or</p>

<p><em>&quot;actually USA&#39;s foreign policy is very offensive, I saw a r/vetting post which showed all their drone kills.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Also instead of always discussing if 9-11 was an inside job or not in every post about 9-11 we could just link the r/Vetting thread on it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello critical thinkers!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s funny to me that you say this because since I started exploring this subreddit the most common theme I see is that you guys don&#39;t care about critical thinking. It seems like most people here hate the truth, just seriously hate the truth. I see so many claims of &quot;undeniable proof&quot; that are straight up obvious lies but they get upvoted for some reason.</p>

<p>I care about what is true or not, so when I am presented with something my line of reasoning goes like this.</p>

<ul>
<li>event happened</li>
<li>what could have caused that?</li>
<li>research</li>
<li>come to conclusion using available evidence</li>
<li>have the ability to change your position as new evidence becomes available</li>
</ul>

<p>and here it looks like critical thinking goes like this</p>

<ul>
<li>event happened</li>
<li>how is the government involved?</li>
<li>twist evidence to fit your desire</li>
<li>call everyone who points out the flaws in your reasoning a shill</li>
<li>declare that everyone needs to wake up to the truth</li>
</ul>

<p>You know, the government does do some awful shit and having people who are skeptical is a wonderful thing imo. But making up facts and creating nonsensical connections between events simply because you hate the government is doing far more harm than good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest issue is assuming we are a single block with a single politic. </p>

<p>There are crazy people here. There are also quite sane people here. </p>

<p>I care a great deal about critical thinking. </p>

<p>I also know enough about the way the media works, and the history of US influence over it, to know that Alex Jones is what is called &quot;Controlled Opposition&quot; and is meant to make <em>all</em> conspiracy people look crazy.</p>

<p>Rather than actually talk to me, any random person could just decide I am &quot;just like Alex Jones&quot;. The reality is far from it, as I think Alex Jones is a fucking moronic charlatan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you read my post about how conspiracy people here ignore facts so they can make up their own reality and your first thought was to counter my argument by claiming Alex Jones is part of a conspiracy to make you look bad and that the government has agents online to try and make you think differently.</p>

<p>I think our definition of critical thinking is vastly different. When I say critical thinking, I mean taking a scientific method approach to reaching conclusions, drawing from facts and not wild speculation.

<p>No.</p>

<p>You are talking to someone with a Masters in sociology - I understand very well what critical thinking is.</p>

<p>Alex Jones is most likely &quot;controlled opposition.&quot; </p>

<p>This is not a crazy statement to make, given the political history of countries and movements seeking to control their opponents. </p>

<p>Given the way Alex Jones characterizes himself, and is characterized by the mainstream media, I believe he is meant to be an easily-dismissible charlatan. </p>

<p>Please notice that rather than engage with me about the concept of Controlled Opposition, you chose rather to insult my inteligence. </p>

<p>Have a nice day.</p>

<p>No, I claimed that Alex Jones is &quot;controlled opposition&quot; and exists to make other conspiracy theorists easy to debase. I do not believe Alex Jones is part of a conspiracy to discredit me individually. </p>

<p>No, I offered that as an example suggesting that I am aware of what &quot;critical thought&quot; is. Stating that I do not know what the world &quot;critical&quot; means in the context of &quot;critical thought&quot; is an attack, despite what you may be claiming now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I am criticizing the community. As I stated I think skepticism is a wonderful trait. But it&#39;s not enough to be skeptical without seeking truth because then what you have is an agenda, you&#39;re not looking for truth you&#39;re looking for ways to convince others that the government is out to get them.</p>

<p>As I previously stated as well, the government does enough bad things that it doesn&#39;t need storied reptilian aliens coordinating false flag attacks with the illuminati to remove your guns from your home. Creating lies doesn&#39;t make people want to stand up against the government, it makes them roll their eyes at you.</p>

<p>Your links had nothing to do with the conversation, you have spammed them throughout this thread and decided you would do the same here. What were you trying to show? That someone did something once, therefor the government is doing it now and everyone who disagrees with you is a shill. I already stated the shill argument is a poor way to hide from facts.</p>

<p>Stop using the Alex Jones method. If you think something is amiss, provide evidence for that case. Not evidence that it happened in the past by someone else or that you just have a gut feeling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suggest a new, private sub, to be formed. One where the described abuses are not tolerated. You must be invited. I&#39;d also suggest mods who are not mods here, save one. This gives more access to the submissions in both rooms, giving them the ability to to filter invitees without overloading the mod. A kind of safe haven for hypotheses and evidence to be formed and ordered, giving true theorists an opportunity to regroup and debate logically possible scenarios, without these ad-hominem attacks and ridiculous antics. Then bring the well thought out theory here, to conspiracy as an intelligent group. </p>

<p>A group, conspiritards, want to fight with uniform lies, going on irrational hostile tangents while twisting your words into something they are not. Respond with uniform truth, intelligent even keeled arguments, and logic, as a group.</p>

<p>Face it, this sub is no longer a safe place to think out conspiracy, but another battleground under heavy attack by a well organized enemy. If there is to be any fighting this conspiracy needs a core group, mostly independent of this place to keep the sub neutral, who are intelligent, to put out the message that we are not going to succumb to these attacks nor will we lie down and quit. </p>

<p>I believe this kind of group may already have a start here, though their methods at the current time don&#39;t seem to be working. Can&#39;t think of the sub name at the moment. If I had the time I&#39;d start one. </p>

I&#39;m sure theres plenty of people paid to be shills on the internet. Especially during election years. I just think most of the bullshit on this sub is just your everyday /b/ grade trollcraft. Theres probably far more people paid to blog, which is just a more proactive version of shillery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this topic is one of the reasons i abandoned most conspiracy theories a few years ago: if u call everyone who disagrees w/ u a &quot;shill&quot; or &quot;troll&quot;, it means you aren&#39;t addressing the actual content of their arguments.  questioning the motives of a poster is ad hominem &amp; ultimately irrelevant if you&#39;re interested in truth.  and bc of the way reddit works, its highly unlikely that a bunch of ministry of truth bureaucrats could even make a dent in vote totals for popular posts.  when u write off those who disagree w/ u as being &quot;in on the conspiracy&quot;, or at least agents of it, u set up a situation in which rational challenges to claims are suppressed, and u end up acting as thought police.</p>

<p>there&#39;s this thing called &quot;gang-stalking&quot;, which is when a paranoid schizo hallucinates that they&#39;re being followed or stalked by groups of ppl.  these schizos form communities online &amp; talk about how the evil gov&#39;t is stalking them, and if u question anything about it, they all call you a &quot;perp&quot;, which in their lingo means you&#39;re 1 of the stalkers &amp; thus in on the conspiracy.  it makes their communities incredibly biased &amp; they just reinforce each others&#39; delusions.  that&#39;s what happens when u stifle debate, and disregarding someone&#39;s ideas just because they disagree w/ u is the opposite of what &quot;critical thinkers&quot; do.  trust me, when u blame any and all dissent on the presence of &quot;trolls and shills&quot; it makes u look brainwashed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a few questions and comments:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What&#39;s the difference between a shill, a paid shill, and someone who just disagrees with you? How do you tell the difference? I assume there is a way to tell, because too often I&#39;ve seen very clear statements of &quot;X is a paid shill&quot; as if you&#39;re absolutely certain.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;ve seen way too many times members of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> treat others with &quot;personal attacks, irrelevant questions, mass downvotes and lies&quot;. (TTTOTTT comes to mind off the top of my head)</p></li>
<li><p>How can you make claims like &quot;Reddit is rigged&quot; and hope to be taken seriously? Even if what many of you are claiming to be true is in fact true, I have to say you&#39;re really doing an awful job at conveying this truth. Because you do a poor job at explaining something (and understandably, others are left incredulous), why do you then resort to calling these same non-believers shills? Then ask for respect in return?</p></li>
<li><p>Too often, I see some rabid CTs who dismiss out of hand whatever facts don&#39;t suit based on an argument of &quot;well, that publication can&#39;t be trusted because they did this 5 years, 7 months ago on page 13&quot;; yet, will absolutely claim truth when their facts come from some alternate news sources, almost all of whom have been proven to be unreliable at some point or another.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I didn&#39;t visit to take sides here, but these are genuine issues that I have that usually prevent me from coming back and visiting. I know a lot of people who ARE interested in a lot of these theories (myself included), but the tone in this subreddit is too often hostile, which in turn, I think is doing you all a disservice if you&#39;re trying to spread the word.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Put alternatively, if there are indeed paid shills, get over it and find another way. It&#39;s getting tiring to see that become the default excuse for losing an argument. There always have been, and there always will be - MOVE ON!!!</p>

<hr/>

<p>Edit: Adding in that users like <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/seriouslyyo">seriouslyyo</a>, while they may have a legitimate point WILL get reported and eventually banned for just being an annoying twat. They will NOT get banned because of a secret army, government agency, or a group of israelis operating out of a basement. It&#39;s his own doing, and know that he&#39;s making the legitimate <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users looks like a bunch of idiots for allowing this shit to go on.</p>

<p>Sadly I don&#39;t think reddit works that way.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t expect to get banned due to a secret army.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t expect to get banned due to your cute little rant.</p>

<p>However, the links I post provide evidence that you are completely and utterly full of shit re: shills on this site.</p>

<p>PS: telling people to &quot;just get over it you lost&quot; is totally stupid. </p>

With our evidence-gathering capabilities, we could gather info in known trolls and shills, and use that personal info to discourage them. Imagine contacting a troll&#39;s employer with a link to their on-the-job Internet activities. We did this sort of thing back in the Digg days with amazing success. </p>

<p>You admit <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratroll/comments/16efsw/bullslawdanshill/c7vd0b2">right here</a> that &quot;shill&quot; equates with being paid to post, when you say that the term &quot;shill&quot; should &quot;stay&quot; on your little  board, as distinct from troll.</p>

<p>You have lost total and complete credibility to me.</p>

<p>I consider that an honor coming from people with no ability to critically examine their sources.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suddenly my sources, which I have not divulged to you in any shape or form, are not valid? Based on what?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please.  You are seriously going to pretend you don&#39;t go to the same places as every other conspiracy theorist?  Uh huh.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also based on this logic, a law student who goes to the library to research a paper, will pick up a book. Now because they didn&#39;t write it themselves, it&#39;s not a valid source for research? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not what I said.  But what you said makes a great point - unfortunately for you, it&#39;s against you.</p>

<p>A law student who goes to the library will pick up a book (or, more likely, use Westlaw or Lexis).  There are primary sources and secondary sources in their library.  They can read a law or case themselves, or they can read what someone else says about that law.  Whether you&#39;re a law student or a practicing attorney like me, the primary sources are better, because they are the actual item being discussed.  A statute is a primary source.  A law professor discussing a statute is a secondary source.</p>

<p>When you use secondary (or tertiary, as most threads here) sources, you have to examine the source as well as the information.  How did the source come to this information?  What are the source&#39;s qualifications to make this evaluation?  You wouldn&#39;t say a music teacher is a very good source on tax law, and you wouldn&#39;t say a YouTube video done by a teenager is a very good source of 9/11 research - <em>unless, of course, you are a conspiracy theorist, and that teenager is confirming your already-held beliefs,</em> hence &quot;Loose Change&quot; being taken seriously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now you appeal to theories like flat earth as another form of ridicule when I clearly mean the theories currently presented on the front page of this sub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t &quot;clearly&quot; mean anything.  If there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve learned from conspiracy theorists, it&#39;s that you&#39;re constantly looking for &quot;gotchas,&quot; and so I don&#39;t assume things like that.</p>

<p>So, theories &quot;on the front page of this sub,&quot; alright.</p>

<ul>
<li>Adam Lanza was a psycho, with a mom who was nearly as psycho (and in fact, a conspiracy theorist - &quot;Doomsday prepper&quot; - herself!  Any of you have kids?).  He went into a school and shot a bunch of innocent people.  The &quot;government&quot; had no involvement.</li>
<li>9/11 was done by 19 Muslim terrorists, mostly Saudis.  They flew planes into buildings, which caused damage and collapse.  The government royally fucked up in their pre-attack actions, their attempts to stop the attack, and their disaster preparedness, but I do not ascribe to malice that which can be explained by incompetency.</li>
<li>Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon in 1969.</li>
<li>Approximately 5 million Jews, along with lots of other people, were systematically exterminated by the Nazis during their reign in Europe.<br/></li>
<li>The Jews have a lot of rich and powerful friends, but they don&#39;t really run &quot;everything.&quot;</li>
<li>Chemtrails do not exist.  They are contrails.</li>
<li>Aliens have never been to Earth, or, if they have, they sure as hell have no interest in secretly running our governments, because they are advanced enough to just destroy us in much more sophisticated ways.</li>
</ul>

<p>What am I missing?</p>

<p>What do you mean my purpose here isn&#39;t to contribute? My purpose here is to contribute a dose of reality into the generally ridiculous conversations that go on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now please specify how you reached those conclusions on those bullet points, oh wise one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In many of those cases, as with most bogus conspiracy theories, basic logical reasoning is enough to get a person most of the way to the right answer.  Tools like Occam&#39;s Razor, the understanding of logical fallacies, and psychology of secrets/secret organizations are things that any college graduate should be capable of applying to arrive at the correct conclusion.  </p>

<p>In many cases, it is enough to say that (1) we know the event happened, and (2) none of the various government conspiracy theories could have possibly happened.  By basic principles of paradigm shifting, we end up with the generally accepted account.  However, people in this sub are incapable of doing so at one step or another, and as such wind up in la la land.</p>

<p>Right.  Well, I respond in time, but in fairness, I have a busy law practice, two kids, an adjunct professor position at my alma mater, a scout pack, a pregnant wife, a classic car, an apartment rental business, a church committee, a brewing hobby, a sailing hobby, a political organization, and a Netflix account.

<p>It&#39;s funny to me that you say this because since I started exploring this subreddit the most common theme I see is that you guys don&#39;t care about critical thinking. It seems like most people here hate the truth, just seriously hate the truth. I see so many claims of &quot;undeniable proof&quot; that are straight up obvious lies but they get upvoted for some reason.</p>

<p>You started by attacking the community.</p>

<p>You continued by attacking the community.</p>

<p>I engaged with you, fairly politely, and shared a couple of links that I think are handy primers for the concept of sock puppet forum sliding. </p>

<p>At some point you decided my links were meant to reveal the secrets of the universe to you, and you remain disappointed. Sorry, knowledge does not work that way. </p>

<p>No, I really do want to understand. </p>

<p>Right now it is my theory that you don&#39;t have a point...do you have a point? It was my intention, initially, to suggest that you should not draw such large blanket statements about r/conspiracy, especially in the face of <em>some sort of evidence</em>. You proceeded to attack me with every post.</p>
