        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Been hearing a lot of talk about the way events are happening now and the legislation coming with it. First, I think the most important thing to address is how our situation mirrors Nazi Germany - the guns, the hyperinflation, the media&#39;s propaganda. It&#39;s all coming to a head and I feel the dollar is soon to fall resulting in riots/uprisings followed by troops in the streets with TSA checkpoints. I don&#39;t care how &quot;crazy&quot; it sounds to some people but if you have been paying attention then you feel and understand my concern at this point. </p>

<ul>
<li>My question is, are we prepared? Mentally? Physically? Spiritually?</li>
<li>What can we do as a community to raise awareness to those around us? </li>
</ul>

<p>I am not trying to worry anyone, I am only trying to bring this out into the open as a community discussion because in my eyes it is VERY important. </p>

<p>*Edit- I refer to hyperinflation as what could happen to our dollar in the market as &quot;they&quot; can toy with it any way they want so it&#39;s just a prediction of mine from seeing the way the world is now. 
Thank you for your thoughts and concerns. </p>

<p><strong>&quot;Given name &quot;FRANK&quot; (Masculine; Usage: English, German, Dutch, French) : From a Germanic name which referred to a member of the Germanic tribe, the Franks. The Franks settled in the regions now called France and the Netherlands in the 3rd and 4th century. They derived their tribal name from the name of a type of spear that they used. The name was brought to England by the Normans.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Frank is not a Jewish name, it&#39;s a European name used by hundreds of Non-Jewish families in the west and originated as the first name for one of the Germanic tribes which settled into modern-day France. Just because Anne Frank and her family had that last name does not make it a Jewish one.</p>

<p>Also..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Franz Xaver Schwarz  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Has nothing to do with the word Frank despite sounding similar. Not even their origins or definition are similar since it&#39;s a purely German name unlike Frank which is European. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only distinction are their names, that&#39;s it. Anne Frank was sent because she was Jewish despite being born in Germany and August Frank arranged it because he was a Non-Jewish German Nazi in the Nazi party and assigned by Hitler as head of the concentration camps.</p>

<p>They both are German and shared the same common European last name but that&#39;s where it ends.</p>

<p>No, Effie Murphy is black. That means &quot;Murphy&quot; is not his real name. That is his &quot;slave name&quot; (lets call it like that).</p>

<p>That would mean that some slave owner deciede to call somebody in his family &quot;Murphy&quot; and he inherit it from his family as last name.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That would me they are related with slave owner with last name &quot;murphy&quot; who was probably original owner of Eddie Murphy ancestors (probably).</p>

<p>I agree with you. But Jews are marring other Jews &quot;preferably&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>All branches of Orthodox Judaism refuse to accept any validity or legitimacy of intermarriages.</li>
<li>Conservative Judaism does not sanction intermarriage, but encourages acceptance of the non-Jewish spouse within the family, hoping that such acceptance will lead to conversion.</li>
<li>Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism permit total personal autonomy in interpretation of Jewish Law, and intermarriage is not forbidden. Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis are free to take their own approach to performing marriages between a Jewish and non-Jewish partner. Many but not all seek agreement from the couple that the children will be raised as Jewish.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_views_on_marriage">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_views_on_marriage</a></p>

<p>Jews marry other Jews. This is the way how the last name is inherited. </p>

<p>But, the question is:</p>

<p>How did the nazis know who is Jewish and who should be sent to concentration camp. </p>

<p>If I have understood you in correct manner it is not by last name. Then, how did they know who to sent to concentration camps ?</p>

<p>Is the Frank traditional Jewish name in germany ?</p>

<p>I think the term is &quot;goyim&quot;. Not Jews. Well, in most cases at that time</p>

<ul>
<li>All branches of Orthodox Judaism refuse to accept any validity or legitimacy of intermarriages.</li>
<li>Conservative Judaism does not sanction intermarriage, but encourages acceptance of the non-Jewish spouse within the family, hoping that such acceptance will lead to conversion.</li>
<li>Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism permit total personal autonomy in interpretation of Jewish Law, and intermarriage is not forbidden. Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis are free to take their own approach to performing marriages between a Jewish and non-Jewish partner. Many but not all seek agreement from the couple that the children will be raised as Jewish.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, you would know the answer to the question.</p>

<p>How did the nazis pick who is &quot;jewish&quot; and who is going to be on the list for concentration camps ?</p>

<p>If it is not by last name...than how ?</p>

<p>How did they know who to send to gas chambers ?</p>

<p>In jewish case that would be correct. They would have same religon and would be from same family. As you can see <a href="http://i.imgur.com/33fJE.gif">here</a></p>

<p>Same last name, same religion, same family.</p>

<p>They have the same last name and same first name initial. </p>

<p>She went to Auschwitz, one of the primary &quot;extermination camps&quot;....but she was then MOVED to another camp where she unfortunately got sick and died. Let me get this straight, why would a 15 year old girl be of any use to &quot;ze evil nazis&quot;, why would they be sending her to different &quot;extermination camps&quot;? According to professional Holocaust survivor Elie Weasel, they brutally murdered the majority of jews at auschwitz.</p>

<p>Something tells me these were internment camps, not death camps. The whole gas chamber spiel is a myth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You cite history, and its modern day correlations as reasons for fear and preparation. It does seem like it&#39;s our (human) nature to create this environment of turmoil, a cycle or spiritual cold fusion. What is most intimidating is that IF there is a cycle, our knowledge of it via the speed of information, may increase the frequency. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say for the sake of discussion that there is a human spiritual cycle of 100 years. In each culture of humanity there is a darkness and an enlightenment. Unlike the physics of our world turning night to day, If this cycle is controlled by the culture itself there must be a catalyst for that light to appear or rather, be seen. </p>

<p>I believe the enlightened are in every culture, as well as those in darkness. Drop a stone in a puddle, that ripple effect, the wave, high both a high point and a low point. </p>

<p>That is what an Athiest fails to account for in declaring the human; a biological power without spirit. The very laws of nature show that once the stone disrupted the puddle, all aspects and changes of the surface are a result of that energy. If our universe was set in motion by a similar BANG, than we are smaller, less powerful results of that bang. </p>

<p>Call it what you will, back to the subject at hand: 
Are we prepared? </p>

<p>Mentally: The mind is a collection of thought according to personal experiences, or &quot;the ego.&quot; There are two ways to prepare a mind to turmoil and that is to experience it first hand and live through it, Or... Utilize the imagination to properly analyse history, not just as facts but as emotions. </p>

<p>Physically: I suck at this one. Slapping burgers and processed meats down my gullet. Drinking floride and diet coke. This shit is not good for the 3rd point, it&#39;s actually been show that floride calcifies your adrenal gland. Physical exercise is important, but not much more than the simple I-O&#39;s of our bodies. If we eat more calories than we burn, we store them in fat, if we move less our muscles burn less and weaken. Pretty simple stuff. Hard to implement in our current culture of fried flesh factories. </p>

<p>Spirit: This all comes down to where your are in development. The only way I&#39;ve found to connect with what many consider to be a soul, is by loving something without a condition. To love another without any impact on you good or bad, without any appeal to the EGO. Takes practice. I still SUCK at it, but I know it works. Are you prepared to love a government agent who executes your family on orders? Can you ever be? </p>

<p>I love to talk about this kind of thing. The imagination is where we can gain wisdom from the experience or even the idea of another person, or even the sound of wind through the trees. I have become much more involved in my local communities last couple years, trying to practice that love thing, I agree with OP that community is important and the internet cannot replace physical presence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said, wish there was a way we could all meet in person without being paranoid if someone was an informant who has infiltrated this sub. I agree that we need to open our minds more to the spiritual aspect of our lives and how we are all connected whether we want to be or not. It&#39;s a matter of practice and determination through which you excel. Love is the way. It&#39;s been that way since..forever? </p>

<p>It&#39;s as if we are watching the &#39;Hundredth Monkey Effect&#39; unfold before our eyes if you know what I mean? It&#39;s just amazing we are living in this time period...it was our souls chosen to go this route. I may sound a little hippie-ish but I think it&#39;s more truth than people can handle really. Slowly but surely I see people that were the biggest skeptics in the world about any of this and yet they turn to ME now...asking advice and questions about what is going on and what they can do. </p>

<p>When people listen to you, that is powerful. Many people have no one that listens to them about simple things ya know? Like, how is their life going? How is school? How is your project? When you have that kind of power you do not use it lightly and I have been using it to the best of my ability, mainly offering things they should research in their own time as to develop their own opinions. </p>

<p>I respect you sir Phillip_Ossopher (love the name) and I hope whatever comes our way we make it through unscathed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What study have you done into the concepts of time? According to some renowned mathematicians and philosophers, the time concept never really stands. When paired with the soul concept it would seem that every human with said soul is the 100th monkey. </p>

<p>The theosophists and a lot of eastern philosophies from which they came claim that a soul is in development until it reaches perfect union once again with the great, what word shall we use, Monad. This is likely the same principal followed by Masonic tradition and I suspect even the Mormons, assuredly Joseph Smith, who was also a Mason. </p>

<p>These traditions put surface restrictions on passing knowledge to all, because some aren&#39;t ready. However if we follow say, Godel&#39;s concept of time, a soul development process wouldn&#39;t be subject to time periods. I don&#39;t have a theory yet, but I&#39;ll think about it. My point was that any era would then be a 100th monkey era, the knowledge will be shared...  </p>

<p>PM me if you want, tell me your tales. Why are people seeking you out? Turning to you for truths in the land of science? Why you, why now? </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you like the handle. I didn&#39;t realize the effects of being represented by a name would open the door for so many conversations. A clever gent and I are discussing it at length <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/16mazs/terence_mckenna_exposes_the_drug_war_con_game/c7xbjzy">here</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe in time as I stated, I only use time as a measurement for the people that really only see time because of clocks if you get me. It&#39;s more of I see people beginning to acknowledge what I have been saying for a while now and they are showing a true interest.</p>

<p>In our era I am referring to..in the past 4 years it, in my eyes, seems to be the 100th monkey effect in a sense of dropping a rock in a pool and it ripples and dies out, but if you drop a bunch of rocks in a pool over and over the vibrations affect one another and keeps going. </p>

<p>They are turning to me for how I see things and for what I see. </p>
