    <div class="md"><p>The News Media is basically using the Sandy Hook event for a full out Assault on America to ban guns</p>

<p>Timeline:
- November 2, 2012: Feinstein met with ATF to finalize “Assault Weapons Ban”
<a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/feinstein-rumored-to-be-pushing-semi-auto-ban-if-obama-reelected">http://www.examiner.com/article/feinstein-rumored-to-be-pushing-semi-auto-ban-if-obama-reelected</a>
- November 4, 2012: Presidential Election - News Media Elects Obama
- December 14, 2012: 5 Weeks later… Sandy Hook - News Media comes for your guns
- January 15, 2013: New York State Bans Guns and Magazines</p>

<p>Sandy Hook Questions Not Asked by the News Media:</p>

<p>-Arrested 2nd shooter? Apprehended man lying on the ground in woods? Other “Camo pants” man handcuffed and sitting in “front” of the police car? Video at 5:55 mark: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6W6b-voc-Ds">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6W6b-voc-Ds</a>  Did the news media report who these people were?</p>

<p>-Does there exist another mass shooting with more deaths than wounded? Has anyone seen even one video or picture of the dead or wounded?
-Responding officers don’t know the difference between used pistol and rifle rounds sitting on the ground at the crime scene? Any pictures exist of the “hundreds of rounds” of shell casings? Pistol or AR spent cartridges are very easy to tell apart.
- Are there any pictures or video of bodies coming out of the school? 
-Any pictures of broken glass from shooting his way into the school or any broken windows anywhere? 
-Who has seen video footage or photos of ANY of the damage at the school?
-What was Adam Lanza’s motive for the shooting? What was his connection to the school?</p>

<p>-Victoria Soto&#39;s class picture for 2012 shows 15 children.
According to official report:
6 children were shot trying to escape
7 children were found in closet by police
6 children escaped and were in Eugene Rosen&#39;s house
Total = 19 children. 4 extra children since the class picture?</p>

<p>-Sandy Hook Nuns? Police scanner: “One of them may be wearing a nun outfit, headed toward Danbury and Stoney Hill, purple van, unknow plates...” What is the box outline under the skirt of the taller nun’s dress?
<a href="http://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?noframes;read=265022">http://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?noframes;read=265022</a></p>

<p>-School Nurse tells reporter that Nancy Lanza was a Kindergarten teacher? Nancy Lanza didn’t have anything to do with the school?
<a href="http://youtu.be/uHEs-XAJqfU">http://youtu.be/uHEs-XAJqfU</a></p>

<p>-Teachers listed as Victims NOT listed on School Website as Faculty? Screen shots showing Cameras are IN Newtown Schools. Who has the video from the school?

Gilles Rousseau, told Radio-Canada that he wanted to see his daughter’s body but was informed by authorities that it would not be possible.
 “They told me, ‘You can’t see (the body),’” Gilles Rousseau told Radio-Canada, the French-language CBC. “Because most people he shot, it was two or three shots in the face, point-blank.”</p>

<p>Why did so many of the victims recently move to Sandy Hook?
- Madeleine Hsu, within the last 2 yrs
- Ana Marquez Greene, moved from Canada this yr
- Avielle Richman, moved to Newtown last yr
- Ben Wheeler, moved to Sandy Hook April 2011
- Emily Parker, moved from NM to Utah, then Sandy Hook
- Charlotte Bacon, moved there in the last 4-5 yrs
- Racheal D&#39;Avino, worked at school less than one week (teacher)
- Dylan Hockley, moved to SH in Jan 2011</p>

<p>-“[My staff] and I hope the people of Newtown don’t have it crash on their head later.” –Connecticut Medical Examiner D. Wayne Carver II, MD, December 15, 2012</p>

<p>The news media is not asking questions because they want America disarmed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very informative, thank you.  Much of this I&#39;ve already heard but this shines light on a few things I haven&#39;t considered.  </p>

<p>With all that being said, I&#39;m still interested in some speculation from Newtonians.  The speculation that it&#39;s a publicity psy op is ever growing.  But Newton is a community just like any other and I would think that it would be pretty difficult to silence that many. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see it. That is not the nun&#39;s right knee. There is obviously a rectangle box shaped object in front of her unbent right leg in the one picture.
School faculty websites are usually accurate with their staff lists, especially if they are in the education business. 
They release videos of everything else on the planet and they can&#39;t show even 2 seconds of any video? Not even of the crime, but even someone entering the building? 
Adam&#39;s face is obviously photoshopped in the picture they showed everyone what he looks like. 
Intelius showing Robbie Parker and His wife at 59 and 77 years old is accurate because it shows all their previous addresses and also works correctly when looking up anyone else. 
There is no footage anywhere of the hundreds of students coming out of the school. Only 1 picture exists with about 20 kids. There are no pictures of 600 kids coming out of the school. 
The parent clearly says &quot;CBS sent me a text message&quot;. You can call her a liar if you want. 
Adam Lanza hasn&#39;t been seen by anyone in the last 3 years, not just the neighbors.
The cop is photoshopped into the picture. 
It is a coincidence that so many victims moved to the town in the last year or 2. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone who was pulled over and had their license run.  In scanner recordings, due to them being non-linear as dispatchers talk to/respond to multiple people, it sounds like the license plate on Lazna&#39;s car is reported to come back to &quot;Chris Rodia&quot;.  But other than that SINGLE audio recording, no one has yet to produce an actual piece of evidence, like a reverse license plate search, that shows the plate on the car removed from the scene belonged to Rodia.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably not to the police, but to the public, sure, as the media/internet usually go off half cocked and report from the hip and usually don&#39;t try to hard to apologize/correct things.  Paul Watson justifies lying by saying that the lie get&#39;s the headline, and the truth/correction gets a blurb on page 2. </p>

<p>Just saying that it shouldn&#39;t be too hard to come up with evidence that the license plate on the car they drove away belongs to Rodia.  Reddit has been known to find the owners of a vehicle from a hit and run based solely on the reverse license plate smudge on a bumper, so why can&#39;t those same sleuths come up with screen shotable proof that Rodia had the car, but instead rely on just an audio transmission which is easily explainable as to how a misunderstanding could be made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to the internet?  Yes.  Because they listened to the scanner feed, and were anomaly hunting.  I&#39;ve listened to police scanners, fire department scanners, air traffic control scanners, etc...(There&#39;s apps for all major smart phones, and they are even online) Even on small walkie talkie systems like we use at my job, you can have multiple conversations going on at the exact same time over the radio.  But if you are used to it, you learn to ignore the stuff that doesn&#39;t pertain to you, and pay attention to the stuff that does.  Also, depending on the system, you won&#39;t hear the officers talking to dispatch, but just hear dispatch calling out information.  So while you hear 5 things in a row coming in over the radio, perhaps only the 1st and 3rd relate to you, and the 2nd, 4th, and 5th relate to someone else.  So you can have someone from Sandy Hook calling in a license plate, and while they are running that plate, a dispatcher will respond to another officer who called in a information request and give that to them over the air.  To someone listening, it can appear that the response is to the license plate at Sandy Hook, as it came after the question was asked, but it&#39;s really a response to a different situation, and the officer who is expecting the response will listen for the info he is expecting.  </p>

<p>EDIT: An example from my job.  Where I work, we have front side security and back side security.  Back side deals with horses, and front side deals with people.  The following conversation(s) would be what you might hear should you tap into our feed.</p>

<p>Loose horse 
Grandstand to 72, what&#39;s your location.
Over by the tunnel
Going between barns 12 and 14(no barn 13)
Behind the kitchen.</p>

<p>Now in that scenario, Backside just cares about the loose horse, and front side, which is where the grandstand is, doesn&#39;t.  In that radio traffic, the 2nd and 3rd were Front Side and the 1st, 4th, and 5th were Back side.  If you don&#39;t know the area, you might not know that if there is a loose horse, it would never be by the tunnel.  The tunnel is for people.  But us backside people know that we can ignore the tunnel comment, as well as the other because it isn&#39;t to one of us,  but the ones about the barns and also the kitchen apply to us, because both of those are on the backside.  It takes some getting used to.</p>

It&#39;s tough to search for it, because there are so many sites that list the scanner feed and the time codes, and none that I can find that show who those plates are registered to.

His mom didn&#39;t work at the school.  He didn&#39;t shoot up his car.  He didn&#39;t get in an altercation at the school days prior to the incident.

There&#39;s a good chance if you come on a scene and there are a bunch of people shot, and one guy has a load bearing vest on with extra ammunition on him, he more than likely was the shooter.

    <div class="md"><p>What if he got pulled over while driving there?  You need to plan for these things, and make it appear that everything is OK(remember, McVeigh was caught because his car was missing a plate).  If he got pulled over with his brothers license and a family members car, short of reeking of booze, drugs, or having a dead hooker in his back seat, the most he would get is a ticket, because it&#39;s not unusual for, that close to Christmas, someone to be home from college and borrowing Mom&#39;s/Dad&#39;s/Uncle Etc&#39;s... car.  As for his appearance, I have my NJ drivers license from before and after I lost weight, as NJ licenses are good for ~4 years, and I look very different, despite it being me, so since they are siblings, I bet that they bear a semblance.   After the ticket, he could just go off and do his crime.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure where you got that parents didn&#39;t panic.  I&#39;m sure they were panicking.</p>

<p>As for the kids, that&#39;s REAL simple.  You ask the teachers.  They make these cool things now called Pol-a-roid cameras that give you instant pictures.  You can show pictures of faces to teachers and get names.</p>

<p>Aside from that, they are a few months into the school year, so they more than likely know the students in their classes.  You ask the teachers to give you names of any of their students who are missing, and also get names from all the students you have or at least ask them who their teachers are.  You have now narrowed the list down to maybe 50-60 students who are unaccounted for.  From there it&#39;s not that hard to cull the list down to the students who it more than likely is, and take those parents aside and have professionals walk them through the steps of doing a final ID, probably by using those photos from before.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I am saying that is one method for identifying a body.  As they were kids, I&#39;m sure their parents had written their names on all of their shoes and clothes.  Can&#39;t tell you how many hats, jackets, etc... I lost in school till my Dad started doing that.  </p>

<p>The best method would be to again, work up a list of children that are unaccounted for by the teachers, who know the students best.  You then hand that list to someone who is checking the parents in at the firehouse to pick up.  If a parent comes for one of those kids on the list, you again, take them aside, and ask what they were wearing that day, and you can again narrow the list down further, because while he shot them, he didn&#39;t strip them down naked, so clothing along can help you ID a body.  </p>

<p>If you believe the on-the-streets investigation being handled by the police is flawed, then yes, you need to get out there and conduct your own.  The conspiracy world has thus far produced zero pieces of verified evidence, only dissections of YouTube clips.  A great starting point would be to hire private investigators to locate a victim&#39;s parents and the supposed actors who play those parents.  If they can be spotted in two locations at the same time, then the &quot;crisis actor&quot; theory is debunked.  If either the family or the actors no longer exist (or never did), then you&#39;ve got a conspiracy on your hands.</p>

<p>And yes, if you came to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and tried to tell them that you&#39;d funded an investigation and discovered that the families are real and not actors, <em>you would be downvoted to oblivion</em>.  Understandably so.  You&#39;d be a buzzkill, taking away the joy that only 20 dead kids can provide to a group of talentless go-nowhere detectives.</p>

<p>This is why <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has a 0.00 batting average on overturning conspiracies.  No desire to do hard work whatsoever, and a community ready to turn on you if you ever did.</p>

<p>But they do.  There was ONE report, ONE.  <strong>ONE</strong>. That there were 4 handguns in the school.  This was from a report less than 24 hours after the shooting, before there were any real press conferences where more info was slowly being handed out, the whole clip of which can be found here, on a trusted site: <a href="http://tv.naturalnews.com/v.asp?v=2E10716E6FD870ADECD5461A6778F3AB">http://tv.naturalnews.com/v.asp?v=2E10716E6FD870ADECD5461A6778F3AB</a>  </p>

<p>That same report was updated afterwards.  But does the conspiracy world believe it?  NOPE.  It conflicts with them, so they will instead show one clip from one station that is over a month old, and insist it&#39;s solid evidence, and anything else is disinfo. </p>

We are far removed from the time when the media would just tell the stories, because now there is so much competition, they NEED to emotional grab readers/watchers/listeners.

    <div class="md"><p>Probably not to the police, but to the public, sure, as the media/internet usually go off half cocked and report from the hip and usually don&#39;t try to hard to apologize/correct things.  Paul Watson justifies lying by saying that the lie get&#39;s the headline, and the truth/correction gets a blurb on page 2. </p>

<p>Just saying that it shouldn&#39;t be too hard to come up with evidence that the license plate on the car they drove away belongs to Rodia.  Reddit has been known to find the owners of a vehicle from a hit and run based solely on the reverse license plate smudge on a bumper, so why can&#39;t those same sleuths come up with screen shotable proof that Rodia had the car, but instead rely on just an audio transmission which is easily explainable as to how a misunderstanding could be made.</p>
