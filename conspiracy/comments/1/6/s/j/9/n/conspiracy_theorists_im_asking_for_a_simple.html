<p>Actually, it&#39;s the other way round. You&#39;re accepting the conspiracy theory as fact, and you&#39;re clearly unable to even come up with the most basic evidence to support your claims. </p>

<p>He&#39;s not afraid of a &quot;differing story&quot; - he is just calmly and honestly asking you to provide evidence to backup the claims you are making.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s not the other way around at all.  After researching an d paying attention to the events that transpired, there are clearly many differing accounts as to the facts in the case.  Many of those conflicting reports were reported by your beloved news outlets.  Finally, they decide on an &quot;official&quot; story to pacify people, despite the fact that there are still so many contradictions and unanswered questions.  Any attempt to revisit those inconsistencies and conflicting reports and address them is met with a fury of name-calling and attempts at discrediting....So in reality, unless I accept the media&#39;s version as &quot;fact,&quot; and base all of my opinions on the assumption that the media is telling the correct story, I am some crazy conspiracy theorist?

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;your beloved news outlets&quot;</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t presume my perspective for me. What the fuck do you know about me?</p>

<p>&quot; Finally, they decide on an &quot;official&quot; story to pacify people, despite the fact that there are still so many contradictions and unanswered questions.&quot;</p>

<p>Who is &quot;they&quot; - were you privy to these conversations? Do you have evidence to back this up? What are the names of the people involved in making this decision?</p>

<p>&quot;Any attempt to revisit those inconsistencies and conflicting reports and address them is met with a fury of name-calling and attempts at discrediting.&quot;</p>

<p>Asking you for evidence is not the same as &quot;name-calling and attempts at discrediting&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So in reality, unless I accept the media&#39;s version as &quot;fact,&quot; and base all of my opinions on the assumption that the media is telling the correct story, I am some crazy conspiracy theorist? &quot;</p>

<p>No - but when you accept the conspiracy theory as fact WITHOUT evidence to support your belief or the original claim - THEN you are a crazy conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>&quot; It&#39;s sad that some people are as naive as you are. I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not one of them.&quot;</p>

<p>Again, it&#39;s the other way around. Unlike you, my opinion can change - I just need to see the evidence, and simply insisting that anything the &quot;mainstream media&quot; says is automatically part of a conspiracy is not evidence.</p>

<p>Another reason we correctly refer to people like you as &quot;crazy conspiracy theorists&quot; (which IS what you are) is because we can easily PREDICT your behaviour beforehand. I know full well before even coming to a place like this the exact kind of things you guys are going to come out with.</p>

<p>A bomb goes off in the US tomorrow - I know automatically that you won&#39;t believe ANY official &quot;mainstream&quot; report and WILL AUTOMATICALLY start blurting out the OFFICIAL CONSPIRACY theory as made up by Alex Jones and the like.</p>

<p>Because nothing says &quot;independent thinker&quot; like the automatic rejection of one story and automatic acceptance of another.</p>

<p>The fact that you are arguing against having to support evidence to back up your claims proves beyond any doubt that you are not interested in the truth.</p>

<p>If you have no actual thought processes behind your claims, that&#39;s fine. Just say so. But if you used any sort of thought patterns at all to arrive at the original conclusion, then that is what I wanted you to share. If not, you can keep your accusations of everyone but you being tools of the system to yourself, and for future reference, try not being and ass to people for no reason.

    <div class="md"><p>Irrelevant.</p>

<p>There absolutely is such a thing as a mostly homogenised modern day conspiracy movement.</p>

<p>Most of it stems from the likes of Alex Jones - just spend a bit of time in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and you get it all:</p>

<ul>
<li>chemtrails</li>
<li>moon landings were faked</li>
<li>sept 11th was a government conspiracy</li>
<li>fluoride is a mind control agent put into water to control the population</li>
<li>the jews are responsible for most things</li>
</ul>

<p>These conspiracy theories and many more asides are all related to the modern conspiracy movement. It is very rare to find someone online who believes sept 11th is a conspiracy but there&#39;s no truth to the chemtrails stuff, for example.</p>

<p>The people who fall for this stuff tend to be weak minded and incapable of independent thought - they are especially poor at critical thinking, which is why they fall it all in the first place.</p>

<p>It&#39;s therefore quite ironic that these same people accuse other, more intelligent people who are capable of critical thinking, of being &quot;sheeple&quot;.</p>

<p>Just look at this thread. A guy just asking for evidence, and he gets called a &quot;troll&quot;, and told, LITERALLY, that &quot;we don&#39;t need evidence&quot;.</p>

<p>Yeah, because your cult is religious and faith based, that&#39;s why.</p>

<p>If you have no actual thought processes behind your claims, that&#39;s fine. Just say so. But if you used any sort of thought patterns at all to arrive at the original conclusion, then that is what I wanted you to share.

I think you&#39;ll find people more apt to listen to you.</p>
