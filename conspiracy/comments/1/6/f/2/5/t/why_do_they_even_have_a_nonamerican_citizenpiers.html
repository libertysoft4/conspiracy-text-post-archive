A simple and yet recent event in our colorful history as a country would be to ask, why didn&#39;t the African-American slaves have guns?  Like Ben said, just because it hasn&#39;t happened to us now doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t happen in the future.  It&#39;s harder to rape someone if they can defend themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Makes me cringe when Morgan talks about &quot;what we need in this country&quot; The sad part about this debate is it looks like we give up rights on either side of the debate.... NRA is pushing for armed guards in schools. That may not take any of our rights away, at first, but any logical person can foresee the potential for catastrophe. Armed officials in schools will no doubt scare the kids into submission, all shootings aside.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Kim Jong Un was in the United States saying these things than, no I don&#39;t think it should be aired on National Television because it would be considered Propaganda and I&#39;m pretty sure that goes against the FCC. Piers Morgan is allowed to say what he&#39;s saying because it&#39;s technically his viewpoint on a subject. I don&#39;t like him and wish that the US would deport him, but what he&#39;s doing isn&#39;t illegal and neither is deporting him if enough the citizens of the US are asking for him to be deported. Because remember this &quot;democracy&quot; is based supposed to be ruled by numbers of citizens not blocked by a single diplomat.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not attacking you or ganging up on you I&#39;m just debating your point of view and trying to get you to think critically not and not just jump to conclusions. The media has a hold on you, if you don&#39;t give Piers the attention he wants than he loses his power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Piers Morgan is paid to air opinions, some of which might even be his.</p>

<p>I assume you want a new rule like <strong>&#39;only U.S. citizens be allowed to speak their opinions while in the US of A&#39;</strong>, or maybe <strong>&#39;only people born in the US of A, to parents that were also born in the US of A, are allowed to air their opinions while in the US of A&#39;</strong>.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t that sound a bit ridiculous to you? It does to me.</p>

<p>In the event that gun control laws are changed in any way (e.g. no assault rifles, cause everybody knows you all need assault rifles to defend yourselves against the gubinment/mexicans/communists/other americans) then i thoroughly expect the internet to be full of gibbering idiots banging on about how it&#39;s all Piers Morgans fault.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, this is very appropriate. The US used to be a British colony, and it is falling under more and more control from the UK as well as Europe. In 1945, the US was No. 1, but now the US has fallen behind Europe to the No. 2 spot in terms of GDP. The City also has a great deal of financial control of the US thru links to the Fed and various other private US banks. They want to disarm us to make us easier to control. That is all that this is about.</p>

<p>However I think that you actually have a problem with the fact that he can reach a mass media. That I can understand and I agree somewhat with you. He shouldn&#39;t be advising US citizens about what laws should be passed he should be discussing the issue and leaving his view out of it.

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I think it is fair to start with the UK and then switch to Europe, because the colonialist mindset is the same, and many of the European countries had colonies. The US had traditionally been against colonies, due to the fact that it knew what it was to be one. It basically supported the decolonialization after WW2. But had problems in the Phillipines South America and supporting France in Vietnam during the Cold War. There is less transfer of excess population now and more financial attack and control thru the IMF, World Bank, IBS, as well as other private banks like Morgan Stanley the Fed, HSBC etc. The European just want to disarm us to make us easier to control when they pull the plug on the country like they did in Greece. You can fairly easily see their blueprint because it works and they just go with what works. If you check around you carefully, you may be able to see the effects already.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Telling me what types of weaponry I am allowed to poses is an infringement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you should be able to have nuclear arms? You haven&#39;t described any rational application of what you quote, nor have you described how the context of the militia effects the statement you quote. Is it important? Is it <em>not</em> important? If you shot a man with a gun, and the police detained you and took your weapon - would they be violating the constitution? According to your dumb argument? Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But seeing as how there are limits on free speech what&#39;s to say that what Piers Morgan is saying isn&#39;t an attack on our national security?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because such an argument a) does not make sense and b) is not consistent with any of the limits that <em>do</em> exist on free speech. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m pretty sure that undermining the constitution is an attack against our nation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then we should lock the NRA up for lobbying the interests of arms manufacturers in the face of legislation legally passed by our congressman. But really, besides that - what a joke. Words don&#39;t undermine the constitution, it&#39;s a man&#39;s opinion of which the constitution goes to great lengths to describe how such actions are <em>perfectly legal</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whatever you say, sir. You claim that my arguments don&#39;t make sense while asking if an individual should be allowed to own nuclear arms.</p>

<p>The militia and the people are two separate entities in the 2nd amendment. A militia is essential to the state in order to be free from federal tyranny just as each person has the right to keep and bear arms to protect themselves from the tyranny of the state and the federal governments.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty convinced you&#39;re a shill tho, and you sure are doing a good job of burying yourself.</p>

<p>Yes. This is what your argument literally means. You are so goddamn stupid you don&#39;t even understand this. You literally told me there should be <em>no limits</em> on your right to bear arms. Fucking jackass.</p>

<p>You see - someone who was literate wouldn&#39;t read it that way because they are one sentence with the latter half being a dependent clause of the first. </p>

<p>Oooh - it&#39;s been a while since someone called me a shill around here. Thanks!</p>
