        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems to me that whenever &quot;they&quot; feel certain people are getting closer to a truth that &quot;they&quot; don&#39;t want to be found out, &quot;they&quot; start branding, by shouting as loud as &quot;they&quot; can, that whatever is being uncovered is a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Which leads me to my next hypothesis...</p>

<p>The louder &quot;they&quot; jump up and down and yell about all the crazies spouting the conspiracy theory (whatever c.t. may be up at the moment), the closer to the actual truth the c.t. is. Therefore, a bellwether indicator for how accurate conspiracy theorists &quot;cut through the bullshit&quot; would be how loudly the weasels who started the action scream about how crazy the theorists are...</p>

<p>Point in case, sandy hook:batman movie shooting:senator gifford::gun control...</p>

<p>Oh... And even more interesting would be all the really vocal crazies who purport truly exotic and goofy scenarios to the press, whom the press deem as &quot;the conspiracy theorists&quot;, and who completely blow the intelligence and questioning behind the original line of questioning... (if the press isn&#39;t going to call &quot;them&quot; on their bullshit, then some of us have to...). Say, I suppose, that there are people working for &quot;them&quot; who have no other purpose than to get into the limelight and destroy any sort of intelligent questioning and insight that may have occurred in any of the events called &quot;a conspiracy theory&quot;...</p>

<p>Or am I way behind the curve and you guys already figured that out?</p>

<p>Sorry to be so long winded, and yes, I do believe the powers that run this country (the people with the money BEHIND the politicians – the ‘richest’ learned a long time ago not to be in power, but to buy and control the power) want the population disarmed and sheep-like, regardless of how benign our leaders sound on television when talking about all the things they, “of course, aren’t going to do”… And I don’t think there’s a one of the ‘richest’ who would feel the slightest bit of conscience in having people and children slaughtered to further their interests. Point in case… these are the same people who profit greatly from war, and selling and feeding both sides in a global/regional/police state conflict…</p>

<p>They have no conscience whatsoever and there are many who do their bidding who are bought and paid for and have even less conscience than their masters…</p>

<p>I worry about the outcome of this as I don’t see a very bright future for the 99%...</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, thank you for saying this. Along that line of thinking... maybe we can let go of the &quot;all or nothing&quot; mentality that seems to pervade the debates.</p>

<p>For example, just because there are so many fishy things surrounding Sandy Hook doesn&#39;t automatically mean that the deaths weren&#39;t real or that the people involved were actors. (Personally, I&#39;m not assuming one way or the other, either side has yet to be proven.) </p>

<p>On the other hand, let&#39;s assume for a moment that the deaths are all real and the people were not actors... let&#39;s entertain this possibility. (Any critically thinking person will not rule out the possibility simply because it doesn&#39;t emotionally appeal to them.) Even if this is truly the case, which it may be, it does not automatically mean that the whole thing wasn&#39;t set up. Real blood sacrifice is always more effective than fake any day... so ruling out the most seemingly popular theories of fake deaths and actors does not, in any way, disprove that it could be something more nefarious at work. </p>

<p>As it relates to your statement: If the deaths are real and the people aren&#39;t actors, claiming otherwise would be the perfect way to discredit <em>all</em> the conspiracy theories. These could just be the straw men while the real issue isn&#39;t fake deaths or actors... rather it is some of the other information that points to another heavily coordinated operation (to push whatever agenda). </p>

<p>One supposed fact or another doesn&#39;t make the whole debate go away... but it could easily distract from what we probably ought to be paying more attention to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, preemptively diverting the discussion to easily debunkable speculation. </p>

<p>The message to the populace at large would be &quot;Here is the best the dirty &#39;truthers&#39; could come up with; aren&#39;t they a bunch of disrespectful sillies? Nothing to see here.&quot;</p>

<p>Edit: I should add that I currently think the real conspiracy/agenda is probably that we are being Hegelian dialected into this:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you continue to research this (as I have done for many, many hours) you will find that this is EXACTLY the case and that many ancient native religions (Not Christianity and all the major religions!) state the fact that there is a greater evil in this world (this is the reason why the Illuminati etc. worship Satan). Every part of this will eventually become a huge, insane picture, but it is nothing less than the Truth. A funny fact of this &quot;evil&quot; is the fact that every American president (except for JFK and Obama), despite the fact that &quot;they&quot; like you to believe that America is a democracy, is related to an ancient bloodline. Obama is not a member of this bloodline, but his grandmother lived in an African village where reports of immaculate conception were made. JFK was assassinated simply because he didn&#39;t want to cooperate. To understand this to the full extend I recommend that you/everybody watch videos of David Icke (search YT for &quot;david icke awesome&quot;, its the one which lasts about 100 min.) and the movie &quot;They Live!&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They Live was a great movie. &quot;I find Carpenter&#39;s depiction of a desperate, violent struggle against contemptuous, deceitful aliens living among us is a remarkably accessible illustration of the motivations behind the otherwise incomprehensible savagery of Islamic fundamentalist terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda. Sure, there was a long, ridiculous wrestling scene with Rowdy Roddy Piper; but the amazing thing about the movie is that Carpenter apparently had a crystal-clear understanding of the rage underlying anti-Western terrorism years before even the first WTC bombing. We cheer for the protagonists, even as we realize that they are becoming brutal terrorists. In the end, we see that the heroes relationship with the dastardly space aliens is nearly identical with the relationship between Islamic militants and ourselves.</p>

<p>The aliens destroy our culture through their dominance of the media, keep our people impoverished through alliances with our corrupt leaders, and are contemptuous of our mores and traditions.&quot; - <a href="http://www.quartertothree.com/game-talk/archive/index.php/t-1754.html">antlers</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fortify your own mind, your own heart.  Do your work and concentrate, focus, meditate.  Go inside yourself and focus on righting <em>yourself</em>.  The world is fucked.  There is nothign you can do about it.  The world you <em>can</em> figure out and help, however, if the world INSIDE - the internal world.  That&#39;s the one you really have to work on.</p>

<p>Get that one straightened out, and you don&#39;t have to worry about the future.  Your future will be bright regardless of 1) what the rest of the external, physical world has to deal with, and/or regardless of 2) whether you yourself quickly die in the process of the tumults of this planet or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, preemptively diverting the discussion to easily debunkable speculation. </p>

<p>The message to the populace at large would be &quot;Here is the best the dirty &#39;truthers&#39; could come up with; aren&#39;t they a bunch of disrespectful sillies? Nothing to see here.&quot;</p>

<p>Edit: I should add that I currently think the real conspiracy/agenda is probably that we are being Hegelian dialected into this:</p>

<p>which was pointed out by another redditor in this thread:</p>
