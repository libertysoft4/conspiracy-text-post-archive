The site he was &quot;hacking&quot; openly admitted they weren&#39;t the ones who pressed charges or caught him, and he was forced to go to court instead of settling outside of court which would probably ensure he got years in prison rather than months.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think he was killed. He didn&#39;t have to be. You take a middle class nerdy american who spends their time and money on the internet, struggles with anxiety and depression and present them with death or 10+ years in prison they&#39;d probably choose death in most cases. My thoughts are more around the unfair treatment of him for no apparent reason. He stood up for someones rights and was destroyed for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I heard that Swartz was offered a 6 month plea deal, so I vote he was a massive pain in the side of the powers that want a blacklist over the Internet. Controlling what we think exists. If we can&#39;t find a site, does it exist? That&#39;s a huge power to wield. Shaping the thoughts of humanity. 
Swartz was able to move the masses into convincing their representatives en masse to flip flop their stance virtually overnight.
Power people saw him as a irritant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually making an example of someone is a conspiracy. That assumes that there&#39;s a power structure singling out someone with whom they disagree and conspiring to punish him as a warning to others who might step out of line</p>

<p>I get sick of people who don&#39;t understand that conspiracies are happening all the time all over the place. The majority are harmless or even helpful. Just because it&#39;s not gvt top secret doesn&#39;t mean its not a conspiracy. And just because its a conspiracy, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the doing of the M.I.C. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we should step aside from whether or not it was a conspiracy of his death and ask if he should have been prosecuted for bringing academic information to the public for free.

<p>Just because they could continue to seek charges against him doesn&#39;t mean they had to. Big difference. There was no victim to his alleged crime. Therefore there was some agenda behind doing so. </p>

It is common for law enforcement to make an example of someone, whether it be a street thug, drug dealer, or someone who steals millions of piad for documents in one fell swoop.
