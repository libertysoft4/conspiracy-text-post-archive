        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I live in the west end of Toronto, Canada.  This happened about 5 years ago.  I was driving northbound on Islington Avenue, and was taking an exit to highway 401 westbound (the incident happened exactly here <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/vbTeW">http://goo.gl/maps/vbTeW</a>.  In the middle of that &quot;triangle&quot; grassy area, was a white truck, flipped on it&#39;s side.  The truck obviously took the corner too fast, and flipped on it&#39;s left side.  The truck had no markings (other than the license plate), and I did not see a driver anywhere.</p>

<p>What I DID see was very disturbing to me (I am from Canada, and weird sh*t just does not happen here).  I saw between 6-8 soldiers in full fatigues and automatic weapons standing around this truck guarding it.  I assumed that soldiers were Canadian, but in as much as I could see, I did not see any country markings on them, and no name tags (I drove by them on the ramp, I was going to the highway 401 as slowly as I could).  No helicopters (sorry)...  About an hour later, I was coming back in the other direction, no sign of anything..</p>

<p>EDIT: The ramp as is shown now, is quite straight, at the time this happened, it was quite curvy there...</p>

<p>TL;DR - saw a white truck flipped on it&#39;s side, in quiet Canadian suburbia surrounded by soldiers (Canadian?) - this sh*t just doesn&#39;t happen here...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP here - I&#39;ve been thinking about this tonight, due to all of the questions folks are asking me.  This is one possibility I think...</p>

<p>Just a few months ago, there was an interesting article</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nowtoronto.com/news/story.cfm?content=189189">http://www.nowtoronto.com/news/story.cfm?content=189189</a></p>

<p>The location of this building is here:
<a href="http://goo.gl/maps/EwrVr">http://goo.gl/maps/EwrVr</a></p>

<p>The flipped over truck happened here:
<a href="http://goo.gl/maps/vbTeW">http://goo.gl/maps/vbTeW</a></p>

<p>It seems that there is nuclear pellet manufacturing going on in the western part of Toronto.  So, this is one possibility:</p>

<p>They manufacture these kinds of nuclear uranium pellets in a residential neighbourhood (WTF again??).</p>

<p>They transport these pellets to some well known nuclear plants in southern ontario, which are all EAST of Toronto (the truck flipped over trying to go highway 401 eastbound) - Pickering plant, Bruce Penninsula plant etc.  To keep things low-key, and not panic locals, they use ordinary small trucks to transport the pellets to the nuclear plants.</p>

<p>The truck flips over (too heavy? too many pellets?) - it was late afternoon, late spring, now rain, no snow.</p>

<p>They all freak out, because it&#39;s &quot;nuclear stuff&quot;, and to protect people from meddling, they decide to bring out military to protect the nuclear payload?</p>

<p>Is this a possibility??  Just thinking out loud..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually no - they were going northbound on Islington Avenue, and they were taking the ramp on to the highway 401 eastbound.  So, they were leaving the western part of Toronto, away from the airport. </p>

<p>There are some cities east of Toronto that have a number of military bases - the towns of Peterborough, Kingston and other towns east of Toronto have a number of major military bases - so from that perspective, the trip makes sense. </p>

<p>What does not make sense to me is:</p>

<p>Why armed soldiers - automatic weapons in very aggressive stance - this is Canada WTF?</p>

<p>Why no cops?</p>

<p>Why not a military truck, but a basic white truck - the kind of thing you would rent when you move?</p>

<p>What weapons were they?  How do you know they were automatic?</p>

<p>You saw a few seconds of it.  You don&#39;t know that no cops had visited the scene.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why not a military truck, but a basic white truck - the kind of thing you would rent when you move?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it was there?  Because it was a civilian contractor moving something in their own vehicle with military support?</p>

<p>Also your assertion that there are never soldiers around Toronto in other posts is just false.  There are lots of them around and tons in and around the 401 every day moving stuff.</p>
