I hate to say it but Tyson actually presents very strong evidence at 17:30 in the podcast that the moon landings were hoaxed.  He says that the Astronauts would have been able to <em>see</em> the stars.  Guess what?  the astronauts claimed they couldn&#39;t see the stars:<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe the moon landings were a hoax, but this one point has always made me curious.</p>

<p>As an experienced photographer the fact that the stars don&#39;t show up on film doesn&#39;t bother me because i know how film exposure works.  I can make things appear or disappear by adjusting the exposure several different ways.  But my eyes are automatic,  I can&#39;t imagine it being possible to not see the stars or at least a few of the brighter ones. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they do.  The dilation of your iris has a dramatic effect on what you see. </p>

<p>This is exactly how the iris of a camera&#39;s lenses works.  The difference with cameras is that you can buy more sensitive film and higher quality glass(lenses) that collect light better.</p>

<p>Which is only due to the atmosphere.  Did you not listen to Tyson&#39;s explanation of why you would see stars on the moon?  This isn&#39;t me just making this up, this is me simply reporting what a world renowned astrophysicist has to say on the subject.  If you want to argue with him about it go ahead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are an experienced photographer would you mind looking at some of the pictures from the original apollo mission and saying whether you think they were really taken on the moon. I never questioned it until I heard (and then looked it up myself) that they did not have a source of artificial light for those photographs. If they didn&#39;t have artificial light (no flash, no spot light, nothing) then the shadows and effects in a lot of the photos don&#39;t seem to make sense. Also, most of them appear to have a backdrop of some sort. There is a clear line going straight across most of the pictures in the back ground where the ground appears to meet the back drop, but maybe that is just my imagination.</p>

<p>Add to this the wide variability in the videos. In some of them the astronaughts move in slow motion... why would you move in slow motion on the moon? YEah you WEIGH less but it doesn&#39;t mean you move slower! It just means things fall slower! But in other movies they seem to move at a normal speed... this tells me that they slowed some of them down to make them look weightless (ok not weightles, 1/6th earth weight), maybe they were jumping or some rocks were thrown up and they needed them to appear to land slowly. Others they didn&#39;t slow down because maybe they were doing mundane tasks. </p>

<p>Anyway I&#39;m of the school that the photos and videos were faked. I&#39;m unsure as to whether we actually landed anyone there or who we actually put there. But that is just me. I&#39;m interested to see what photogtaphers think of those pictures. Sure I&#39;ve obviously watched my fair share of moon hoax documentaries, but I&#39;m always looking for more...</p>

<p>I actually never considered myself one of &quot;those moon conspiracy&quot; guys.  But my instinctive bullshit meter just couldn&#39;t handle this one.</p>

<p>Also.. I wasn&#39;t that impressed that Neil Tyson&#39;s <a href="http://youtu.be/DhcxffIENBU?t=27m30s">rebuttal</a> was this convoluted description of how there was enough fuel present to take them to the moon, how pictures of the moons surface were taken while in orbit, how the astronauts were picked up in the ocean, and that they met the president?  </p>

<p>I have much respect for the man, but that answer did not sit well with me.  None of that adequately addressed the allegation of faking video footage.  It seemed more like he was asking me to suspend my disbelief and go along with the story just because it sounds better that way.  </p>

<p>I completely agree.  I still respect the man.  One thing though, the reason people like him is because he is so thoroughly likable and decent,  - I don&#39;t <em>want</em> to disagree with him even when he is making bad arguments.  To be honest he may be a great scientist but some of his views on how people and the government work seemed a little naive.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never put much thought into it either way.</p>

<p>But...</p>

<p>I do find it strange that in the 1960´s they figured out a way to send multiple spacecraft all the way to the moon and back. I don´t know the actual stats, but it seems like very few died in the efforts - percentage wise.</p>

<p>Now - 20 some odd years later, for a span of 25 years - the best we can manage is a glorified space dump truck that can only orbit and do little schoolkid experiments with spiders and whatever else. And, to add, there have been 2 ( I think, or maybe more) disasters. Somehow my gut tells me there may be something a little off with the official story.</p>

<p>I´ve heard the proof. Like most other government sponsored proof it always includes built in faults.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is that the space &quot;dump truck&quot; accomplishes it&#39;s mission very well.  It carries a bunch of people and cargo to where it needs to go, and returns.  That&#39;s where we are at now, we want to carry a bunch of things somewhere, with crew, and stay there for awhile.  There&#39;s really no reason to do that on the moon, meaning, aside from probably a few things, that which we can do on the moon we can also accomplish on the ISS for cheaper and quicker and also longer.  It&#39;s that we moved away from the tech of landing on planets with people, and focus on getting people up there and staying up there.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And obviously the other nations that have made it into space seem to all agree somehow. That I find a little suspicious also. </p>

<p>Of course the dump truck works well. After developing and successfully utilizing crafts which could go all the way to the moon and back safely and repeatedly some half a century earlier, I would think it would be no more than an afterthought to develop and use the dump truck. Its the same way that after past explorers found a way to sail to other continents, they immediately went back to building less seaworthy vessels and concentrated for the next century or so on sailing around a few miles off shore of Portugal, and Spain.</p>

<p>I know it sounds snarky in tone, but I´m trying to express it in the way in which it strikes me. It´s called space exploration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are right, I should have said &quot;arcs as you see them on that picture&quot; i.e. a vertical arc of suspended dust. The only possible cause for this is that dust is being affected by air while stones fall down. </p>

<p>in vacuum stones will fall down together with dust and you will see a &quot;rising sun&quot; form of arc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watched the video and I have to say I agree with a lot of what he says surrounding the mission. That is the relationship to the Russians and how it all progressed. </p>

<p>I have a very hard time accepting the notion that politicians or government entities had any desire to go to the moon, or beyond it. It was merely a nice way to sell the public the idea that we had to get into space. A necessary reaction to having bombs that blow up further than ever before. Meaning in essence the space program was a lot more of a military endeavor, than a scientific one.</p>

<p>Did we go to the moon ? I dont know, personally I dont believe it matters. Arguing the logistics of it only serves as a time waster as we know for a fact that they made it into space, the question is just how far did they actually venture.</p>

<p>Besides, their visor wasn&#39;t always down.  Here is a picture of Armstrong on the moon with the visor up:

<p>Point taken.  I would add however that stars are sources of light so I am not sure that under no circumstances would I be able to see stars.  For instance you would see at least one - the Sun.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>One other thing to keep in mind about this issue of the stars is that the visibility of stars isn&#39;t a minor issue, because stars are what one uses to navigate.  As Aldrin says in the video the stars are what they used to navigate to the moon.  Point being the issue of star visibility isn&#39;t a minor one.  On the contrary it would have been one of the main questions they would have had.  They would have wanted to know precisely under what conditions the stars were visible and were not visible.  It would have been one of the main scientific tests they would have wanted to perform.  The idea that these guys never once stood in the shadow of the capsule with their visors up to look at the stars is <em>absolutely preposterous.</em>  I find the notion that an astronaut on the moon would say &quot;we were never able to see the stars from the moon&#39;s surface&quot; completely unbelievable.</p>
