        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">14</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-01-10 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/DUCKJOBdotWAV.html">DUCKJOBdotWAV</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A frequent complaint is that the media isn&#39;t doing their job and digging up evidence on the Sandy Hook case, so why hasn&#39;t a single person in the conspiracy world taken it upon themselves to travel to the scene and conduct interviews, hire a private investigator, and lift the curtain on the conspiracy?</p>

<p>If the &quot;crisis actors&quot; conspiracy is true, then it would be staggeringly easy to expose it with real hard-copy evidence by just spending some time on the scene, conducting interviews, and having a private detective dig in for a few days.</p>

<p>All I&#39;ve seen is a ton of &quot;internet investigating,&quot; which, let&#39;s face it, has a next to 0% success rate.  If it were useful, then police and FBI would solve crimes using YouTube and blogs.  They don&#39;t, and that should tell you something.  I would assert that I&#39;ve spent more time doing on-the-street investigation of my stolen bike than the entirety of the conspiracy world has done on Sandy Hook, and you&#39;d probably have a hard time refuting that.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s with the nonchalant attitude?  It&#39;s clear that you believe this was a coordinated move as a push toward your eventual enslavement, but what&#39;s your attitude toward investigating it?  <em>Yaaawn, let someone else do it. It&#39;s too hard. It&#39;s too far away. Not my job.  They won&#39;t let us.</em></p>

<p>A comic book fan will make it a point to fly to Comicon, but a conspiracy theorist can&#39;t make it a point to drive to Newtown and employ an investigator?  Does this mean that geeks are more interested in a Kevin Smith panel than you are in investigating your own enslavement?  Why is it just excuse after excuse?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the &quot;evidence&quot; on display here isn&#39;t the kind of thing you can take before a judge or to force a Federal investigation.  It&#39;s fine for within the walls of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, but people on the outside want to see something concrete and legally admissible.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand the incredibly casual approach around here if you believe that your enslavement is imminent.  Isn&#39;t that kinda serious?  Why is the idea of doing hard work to stop your enslavement always met with a series of excuses?</p>

<p>honestly, this tactic is lacking. i agree it is probably the best thing anyone could do to get over there and spend time and money for the pursuit of the truth. but coming here with a colorful generalized description of what &#39;we&#39; must all think and be like, and talking about your stupid bike is a less than helpful solution, imo.</p>

<p>You may not have vacation money, but a lot do (and live within easy driving distance of Newtown), and the idea that not <em>one</em> has decided to reallocate pleasure funds toward lifting the curtain on a conspiracy they believe is designed to enslave them?  That&#39;s incredibly odd.</p>
