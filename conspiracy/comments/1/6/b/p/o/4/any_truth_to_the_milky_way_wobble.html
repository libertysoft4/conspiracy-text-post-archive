        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is not my idea, but I was intrigued enough to ask Reddit what they thought:</p>

<p>Something not being mentioned for fear of global panic. 65 million years ago the dinosaurs were wiped out. 130 million years ago geological records show another mass extinction. Get it? Every 65 million years our planet gets zapped. By what? Well it turns out our solar system doesn&#39;t stay in the same plane within the Milky Way Galaxy. It floats up and down in a rhythmic pattern. We generally think of our galaxy as a flat spiral sitting on a piece of paper.  It has an x and y direction, but no real height.  But it does have some height and every 65 million years we come up to the top edge of the galaxy.  This exposes us to particles and energy on the outside of the protective shield of the galaxy. Just like the earth&#39;s magnetic iron core protects us from deadly particles coming from the sun. The galaxy itself has been protecting us from deadly particles coming from the universe at large. That protection goes away every 65 million years and we experience an extinction event.</p>

<p>Times is up. Our solar system is getting into the unprotected zone. This global warming we are seeing, it&#39;s not from fossil fuels, it&#39;s from the high energy particles on the outside of our galaxy. Consider this, the polar ice caps on Pluto have melted over the last 10 years. Is that our fossil fuels affecting Pluto? Of course not. It&#39;s our entire solar system being exposed and warming up.</p>

<p>Record high temps in the US last year. Record high temps in Australia this year that are so hot they had to add new colors to the temperature charts. 122 degrees. That&#39;s not survivable in the long run. We will all perish - except for some species, as happened in the last mass extinction, that can find shelter in the ocean or underground. Or remember that some of the winged dinosaurs did survive once wild fires ravaged the land, by taking flight, thus giving us modern day birds.</p>

<p>But unless you are a horseshoe crab, a flying dinosaur, or a cockroach, you are doomed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been wondering about this cycle of events, as well.  And I totally feel you on the data that supports the facts that <strong>other planets in our solar system are experiencing unusual weather events</strong>.  Jupiter&#39;s famous &quot;spot&quot; disappeared!  It gained a new one, but... same thing... I don&#39;t see how <em>our</em> CO2 emissions could be affecting Jupiter&#39;s weather patterns.</p>

<p>It&#39;s strange times we live in.  According to the Maya long-count... it wasn&#39;t necessarily about &quot;the end of days&quot;, but a long procession of cycles of life.  We awake, then learn, then <em>peak</em>... and then go &quot;back to sleep&quot;.  The &quot;back to sleep&quot; cycle has ended, and we are supposed to be entering a new &quot;waking up&quot; phase.  Hopefully, enough people will wake up to see we&#39;ve got to make some major changes to this planet and the way we treat and work with each other... or the worst scenarios will unfold.  </p>

<p>Masha&#39;Allah... God Bless.. Namaste... and look out for each other out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look... I understand the Atheist point of view, with the whole, &quot;I don&#39;t need God to live a good life, have morals, etc...&quot;, and that&#39;s awesome.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what specific &quot;god&quot; you think I&#39;m referring to in my blatherings... I just think that there have been some pretty laid-back, peace-loving, enlightened individuals were all trying to preach the same basic, good things, in their place and time.  They obviously made a big enough splash  at some point to get noticed.  A bunch of idiots will always push <em>something</em> to the extreme.. Whether in the name of &quot;teachings&quot; or &quot;religion&quot; or &quot;cult&quot;... there&#39;s always an asshole that takes it too far.
By spouting a little generalized hate at <em>everyone&#39;s</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>archaic gods that got us to this point and perpetuates the evils in our society</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...well... that kinda puts you on the hater-train, too.  Being so condescending ain&#39;t gonna help anyone &quot;wake up&quot; to any <em>new</em> ideas.. so if you wanna help out any of those </p>

<blockquote>
<p>humans enslaved to those that god speaks to</p>
</blockquote>

<p>well, change you&#39;re tactic a little, and you may show some folks that a world without any <em>organized religions</em> may be a better place.  I think it would.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The <em>hater-train</em> runs on the track laid by belief systems. I hate religion. I am not afraid to say it - nor will I not hesitate to point out that &quot;it is bad luck to be superstitious.&quot;</p>

<p>To place faith in a deity is to remove the belief that you have in yourself. When you &#39;god-bless&#39; people, you&#39;re assuming that they believe in the god you just requested blessings from, otherwise it&#39;s just another new cliche saying like &#39;namaste.&#39; </p>

<p>I have love for humankind, but we just don&#39;t want to let go of these entirely irrelevant and highly dangerous beliefs. I actually take to the Jiddu Krishnamurti approach:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? Because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind.” 
― Jiddu Krishnamurti </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Call me an atheist if it helps you decide what I am, but know this: I am simply me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2010/20may_loststripe/">Here&#39;s the NASA link about Jupiter losing one of its &quot;bands&quot;</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/spaceweather/index.html#q27">And HERE are some great Q&amp;A&#39;s about space weather and changes going on from NASA</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread221608/pg1">ATS had a whole thread/article on this</a></p>

<p>Now... just like anything else on this board... take all info with a grain of salt.  Some of the recent changes <em>could</em> be affected by the standard solar max/min cycle.  But, I&#39;ve come across similar stories (I can try and dig for more bookmarks when I get off work) over the past year.</p>

<p>I think that all of our industrialization isn&#39;t exactly <em>helping</em> our climate and planet... but I think some of these &quot;extreme weather events&quot; could be tied to our natural, 26,000 year processional cycle around the galaxy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm this is a bit inconsequential. </p>

<p>A full rotation around the galaxy is over 200 million years. A full cycle of &quot;up and down&quot; motion on our orbit around it is (might be off here but from what i remember) less than 100 thousand years. The Mayans were FAR from being advanced enough to know what the consequences of galactic events would mean to us and in some ways, so are we.</p>

<p>So many things are possible with the universe, so many scenarios we could see. (Direct hit from a GRB, Freak asteroid impact, etc...)</p>

<p>But most scenarios thought of by the general population is so far from reality or the odds of it happening are so infinitely low that it&#39;s just as i stated first... inconsequential.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that amateur astronomy has seen a boom in the last decade so asteroids and comets are detected at a much faster rate. An incoming world killer would be seen a LONG time before it actually strikes. If kept secret at first by officials, amateurs would end up seeing it pretty quickly and that wouldnt be kept secret.</p>

<p>The only problem i see in the &quot;distant&quot; future (human scale) is a star that could interfere with the Oort cloud in about 1 million year.</p>

<p>Eventually tho&#39;, if we get there, the Sun will kill us all. THAT is a certainty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, this sounds awfully familiar. You guys really love doom and gloom, end of the world/mankind scenarios don&#39;t you? And when it doesn&#39;t happen you find a new one to latch onto, i&#39;m sure some fucking bigot that goes on Google and researches something for a hour knows alot more then leading scientists of the world. Keep on spreading fear buddy, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> loves it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look... I understand the Atheist point of view, with the whole, &quot;I don&#39;t need God to live a good life, have morals, etc...&quot;, and that&#39;s awesome.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what specific &quot;god&quot; you think I&#39;m referring to in my blatherings... I just think that there have been some pretty laid-back, peace-loving, enlightened individuals were all trying to preach the same basic, good things, in their place and time.  They obviously made a big enough splash  at some point to get noticed.  A bunch of idiots will always push <em>something</em> to the extreme.. Whether in the name of &quot;teachings&quot; or &quot;religion&quot; or &quot;cult&quot;... there&#39;s always an asshole that takes it too far.
By spouting a little generalized hate at <em>everyone&#39;s</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>archaic gods that got us to this point and perpetuates the evils in our society</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...well... that kinda puts you on the hater-train, too.  Being so condescending ain&#39;t gonna help anyone &quot;wake up&quot; to any <em>new</em> ideas.. so if you wanna help out any of those </p>

<blockquote>
<p>humans enslaved to those that god speaks to</p>
</blockquote>

<p>well, change you&#39;re tactic a little, and you may show some folks that a world without any <em>organized religions</em> may be a better place.  I think it would.</p>
