    <div class="md"><p>One of the most powerful images from Columbine was <a href="http://timeswampland.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/columbine-high-school-shooting.jpg?w=360&amp;amp;h=240&amp;amp;crop=1">this</a> one showing Harris and Klebold in the act. The chilling silhouette of Klebold with the TEC-9 did more to advance the cause for tighter gun controls than 10,000 words of rhetoric could ever accomplish.</p>

<p>Where&#39;s the image of a remorseless Adam Lanza with his Bushmaster AR-15 walking down a Sandyhook hallway?  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to see bodies, blood or gore. I have NO desire to see dead children or teachers. I don&#39;t even need to see the dead perpetrator.</p>

<p>I just want to see bullet holes in the walls. I want to see spent brass on tile. I want to see shattered plate glass and crime scene tape. (I understand not having this sort of evidence from the Aurora shooting. There is going to be a trial, there are survivors, witnesses etc. Even with this fact there were plenty of pictures of physical evidence outside the theater.)</p>

<p>Essentially, I want this tragedy treated JUST like every other shooting the macabre media splashes across the headlines and in continuous coverage. If the goal is gun control, why not use all imagery available just like they have in the past?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to believe that this is anything worse than it is. It is already one of the worst days in American history.</p>

<p>..but if they announce that there was a &quot;system malfunction&quot; and there is no video and seal the crime scene photos since there will be no trial and announce that Lanza&#39;s hard drive is unrecoverable because of the damage and the city demolishes the building because they &quot;want the community to have some closure&quot;.... </p>

<p>They can shut a hell of a lot of people right the fuck up with the release of just a few bits of impersonal evidence that is respectful of the families and the community but yet totally debunks most if not all the conspiratorial hypotheses put forward. They could inspire real outrage and a groundswell of support for any laws they want to pass. An unstoppable wave of anti-gun fervor greater than what we see now could be stirred up by the images that should exist.</p>

<p>M.E. H. Wayne Carver said it himself </p>

<blockquote>
<p>you can control the situation, depending on the photographer and I have very good photographers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Will we ever see these images? Time will tell.</p>

<p>Edit: Formatting.</p>

<p>I do NOT want the release of any images of dead children.</p>

<p>My point is that if you want a powerful image to sell the country on gun control, show the public security video still frame shots of Lanza walking up to the front door of Sandy Hook Elementary with his AR-15 in hand. Law Enforcement have released images like this for other incidents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was no need to identify Klebold or Harris at Columbine or Cho at VT. Yet for both of these incidents images of the assailants holding firearms were front and center in most forms of media for months after the event. They were powerful images used to emotionally charge the discourse and sway public opinion. This time we get a small B&amp;W portrait and an old family photo showing a very non-threatening socially awkward young man.</p>

<p>Every single person who saw Adam Lanza that day is dead. To my knowledge, that is unique feature to this incident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(AFP) – No video has been released of Adam Lanza entering the SandyHook school but the school had recently spent $300,000 on a new security system including state of the art video cameras and door locks. One of the big questions is how did Adam Lanza get into the school did someone let him in as he was carrying an assault rifle? Was the door left open? Did he shoot out the door? This is a key question from the event. No pictures exist of the crime scene. No one was wounded. No one survived. Out of 20 no one survived? Maybe because they blocked the road to ambulances?</p>

<p>This is <em>not</em> from Agence-France Presse.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No, he shot out the glass.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No pictures exist of the crime scene.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No pictures have been released. Of course they exist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No one was wounded. No one survived. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No <em>children</em> who were wounded survived. There was at least one wounded adult who survived and quite a few other children and adult survivors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Out of 20 no one survived? Maybe because they blocked the road to ambulances?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were two ambulances standing by while police searched the building. As soon as it was cleared, the ambulances were called to the scene. The police checked the children for signs of life and as the first ambulance pulled up, there was a policeman holding a child, trying to stop the bleeding by holding his hands over the wounds. The officer told the EMT, &quot;call dispatch and tell them to send everything.&quot;</p>

<p>Another officer radioed &quot;see if surrounding towns can send EMS personnel. We’re running out pretty quick.&quot;</p>

<p>Sadly, of course, as they checked the many bodies, they found only one other with any signs of life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your concern about these videos... especially since there is so many oddities surrounding this incident. But when faced with your question my mind goes to another question... Why would they show the videos?  There is an official story of what happened and they have told us what transpired. If what they have told us is true then why would they even need to show such video?  I understand that you are looking at this from a skeptical standpoint and I also am somewhat skeptical of the official story. But look at it from their perspective... there is no reason to show the public such video.</p>

<p>Edit: I just wanted to add that the goal of the people involved in this situation is not to validate what has happened... to these people what has happened is real enough in itself and does not need to be justified.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the one thing I don&#39;t get. People around me at work and people on my facebook want to dismiss investigation because &quot;kids&quot;. I even saw some little 19 year old girl post that conspiracy theorists re: sandy hook should &quot;fuck right off&quot; because &quot;kids&quot; and &quot;guns&quot; and &quot;crazy people&quot;. I am not giving my opinion on Sandy Hook either way (and I have one) but shouldn&#39;t the people that do not think we should figure out truths about children&#39;s deaths &quot;fuck right off&quot;? Seems fair enough to me.</p>
