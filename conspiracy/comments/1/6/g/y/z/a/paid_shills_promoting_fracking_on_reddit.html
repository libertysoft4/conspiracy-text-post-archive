    <div class="md"><p>I come from <a href="/r/geology">/r/geology</a>, and I&#39;m just about finished with my BS in the SCIENCE OF GEOLOGY.  Get that?  We aren&#39;t paid shills, we do the actual science focused around your topic.  We&#39;re the ones who conduct experiments, we&#39;re the ones who file the reports, and the students are the ones who hear all about our professor&#39;s findings and research on the topic of fraccing.  With that said:</p>

<p>Fraccing itself is not what&#39;s making water flammable or putting all of those horrible deadly chemicals into your water.  It is <strong>INPROPER WELL CASING</strong>.  Many well casings are made cheaply/quickly/and just downright improperly and they do not keep that bad stuff out like they are supposed to. </p>

<p>The actual act of fraccing does not cause bad fluids and chemicals to &quot;leak&quot; out, because fraccing happens THOUSANDS of feet below the water table.  The water table is at most a couple hundred feet down, depending on where you are, but fraccing occurs generally around 7000 feet down in a <strong>shale</strong> layer.  And all of that gas you&#39;re worried about?  It&#39;s not going to magically float up to the surface, physics just don&#39;t work that way.  The only way that gas could get all the way up to the water table is if the company does not monitor pressure at all, and the overlying layers are made of something super porous like sandstone.  If the company puts too much pressure on the materials in the shale they might get pushed up by the water through the <em>thousands of feet</em> to the water table.  I don&#39;t think I need to tell you that this is <strong>highly unlikely</strong>.  No oil/gas company is going to be that negligible when their profits are on the line.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s where fraccing <strong>might</strong> cause harm: tectonic activity.  There&#39;s a place in Guy, AR that is a fraccing area.  Before fraccing the area had <em>maybe</em> one or two earthquakes a year.  After the companies started to drain the wastewater, the area had over <strong>1000 earthquakes</strong>, some at a magnitude of 4.7.  This is what you guys should be circlejerking about, because the research over the exact cause and the potential harm it might do to the area is ongoing.  We&#39;re still not sure if this is just the crust&#39;s way of fixing itself after empty space is left down there, or if the increased tectonic activity is a truly dangerous thing.  We just don&#39;t know yet.  We need more data.</p>

<p>So in the future, get your facts, ask the scientists, go where the money <strong>isn&#39;t</strong> and don&#39;t ride on some dumb internet geek&#39;s coattails to ignorance.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Honeydick gave me a great link to a site <a href="http://www.geotimes.org/mar06/NN_OKgaseruption.html">that describes how bad cement jobs are also a large part of the problem.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you!  I followed that link over here from r/geology too.  I just got my masters&#39; in geology and would have tried to make a similar argument, but I just got hired on with a major oilfield services company which I&#39;ve made comments about elsewhere so r/conspiracy would probably interpret me as a &quot;shill&quot;.  whatever.
That being said, I&#39;ll add my industry blurb so I can collect some downvotes.  Since the company I work for is so huge, before we ever step foot on a rig we get stuck with MONTHS of training in the overwhelming range of processes and equipment involved in the drilling and producing of oil.  And in my position I hardly have to scratch the surface of most of this shit and it still takes months.  Ass covering to the extreme, really.<br/>
But I have friends from grad school who had quit from little po-dung west Texas drilling services companies that hire you on and throw you on a land rig with about 10 minutes worth of training.  That&#39;s the kind of situation where your accidents happen, in really any line of the business.  Inexperience and a smaller ass to cover.
Man, and if you guys knew the amount of shit that COULD go wrong everyday and doesn&#39;t, just for your cheap gas/electricity...holy shit.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that is kind of the deal.  One company actually owns the drilling rig.  Another company, an actual oil company (BP, Shell, etc), basically rents it to do the drilling.  Companies like mine are &quot;oilfield services&quot; companies, and we provide services to the oil company for stuff like formation (the rocks we&#39;re drilling) characterization and monitoring the 50 zillion sensors for each process.
So if something goes wrong, companies can point fingers at one another.  But eventually the buck lands on somebody. I mean, we could just have easily been pointing fingers at Halliburton for the whole Gulf thing.  Their cement job was a big part of the overall screwup.  There were a bunch of things that went wrong with Macondo that individually wouldn&#39;t have been a problem, but there was a lack of communication btwn companies and problems piled up fast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They must do some interesting stuff with imaging! (Imaging the underground structures by means of various remote sensing methodologies)</p>

<p>Have you been following this &quot;giant sinkhole&quot; story? (Bayou Corne, LA.)</p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty bizarre.. I don&#39;t know what to make of that..</p>

<p>I guess my biggest fear is the methane &quot;clathrate gun&quot; hypothesis being true.</p>

<p>If we can avoid that kind of thing, and the big volcanos, nuclear meltdowns, etc, I think we could (although with great difficulty) deal with most of the other stuff. Assuming it happens slowly.</p>

<p>But, we could end up needing to find some other planet to live on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, the stuff we look at in the gulf is pretty boring.  Sand sand sand shale sand shale shale marl marl...zzzzz.  And there&#39;s no point in actually imaging it.  We just analyze parameters like porosity/permeability and gamma radiation (emitted by shales that contain radioactive minerals) and make inferences from there.  My job is to actually look at rock cuttings from the wellbore and characterize them.  I saw much cooler shit in grad school, this one guy was doing stuff with a downhole camera type thing taking pictures of this limestone that had big vugs in it made by the dissolution of various bivalve shells.  Neat looking.  </p>

<p>Nope haven&#39;t been following the sinkhole thing...what&#39;s that all about?  </p>

<p>The methane thing stresses me out.  I would love to like buy up a plot of land someplace and start planting fruit trees while I&#39;m still working, but I dunno what temperature/precip will be ten-twenty years down the road.  It could be that I ought to get land in Canada and plan for it to have a Texas climate.  Who knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, at least you have a job in your chosen field, and that is definitely a good thing. Geology is pretty interesting, I wish I knew more about it. What little I know is nice to have when I travel around, as it makes observing the world around me a little more interesting. </p>

<p>The geological history of this planet is really something. </p>

<p>The sinkhole I am not really following as closely now as I was at the beginning because I thought that the methane coming out of it might have had some origin in these deposits off of the continental shelves (I think this area is alluvial, which is to say that at one time I think it was offshore, not on land) however, it seems as if the problem with methane perhaps (I am just going from what I had read) originated in an underground salt dome that was being used for storage of natural gas.. not the methane ice.. and its an offshoot of this altogether regrettable and horrid situation, not some kind of planet-changing event.. </p>

<p>There is a lot of coverage of it at <a href="http://enenews.com">http://enenews.com</a> - you can&#39;t miss it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know where I would want to live with climate change.. I think about that a lot, actually. </p>

<p>Really, the most important thing is being able to support one&#39;s self and to have a good community..people who are positive influences on you.. an environment where you will want to be engaged in the community..</p>

<p>That will keep your brain engaged.. thats the most important thing, really. also, sustainability of the basics of life..</p>

<p>Far inland, you never know, in terms of hot and cold, the weather is much more potentially extreme than on the coasts.. But of course on the coasts they have storms, tsunamis, every place has its good and bad issues..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need some new kind of business structure that handles the situation responsibly. </p>

<p>Then we would be starting to do what we can do, to minimize risk, right now we are not.</p>

<p>If only everyone could stop their spinning and start thinking together to solve the technical problems, we could do it.</p>

<p>What&#39;s happening is &quot;groupthink&quot;. Its worth Googling that word, and looking into ways that have been examined to try to overcome it.</p>

<p>We should look at energy as the kind of important issue that really, our entire planets future depends on solving. The way we do things now, is just not going to carry us much farther. people profoundly do not trust politicians and they are not doing anything to change that, I see it becoming more and more of a problem.</p>

<p>What about the rank and file of these organizations. They should be able to see that their quality of life and their satisfaction in their careers is influenced a great deal by the professionalism of their organizations. Nobody can maintain their mental health when their organization is covertly working against the public interest. In the long run we all have a great deal to gain, by overcoming &quot;groupthink&quot; and the slash and burn, short term profits over long term interests kind of mentality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even though it gives me a job for now, the hydrocarbon-driven economy needs to be phased out.  But I guarantee it won&#39;t happen until the situation is past fixing and everyone has been visibly affected.  People are just too complacent.

    <div class="md"><p>A couple of points about fracturing in Wyoming (where Gasland shows flaming water, etc.):</p>

<p>1) &quot;INPROPER &lt;sic&gt; WELL CASING&quot; is not what is causing the flammable water in places like Pavillion, WY, it&#39;s a natural phenomenon. The gas companies tap into the same sandstone reservoirs that domestic wells do, but at much greater depths. These sandstone units are not horizontally or vertically continuous, which is why fracturing fluids have never been found in domestic water supplies (seriously... the EPA stated that outright in their December, 2011 Report on Pavillion). Methane seeps were documented in that area in the late 1800s and the water was described as barely potable, due to high salt content, back then as well.</p>

<p>2) The geology of the Pavillion area is unlike most gas producing areas in the US, primarily because of the depositional environment of the sandstone and siltstone that the gas is trapped in. The gas was produced in a deeper shale unit and has migrated up into these permeable reservoirs and became trapped there with the groundwater. A lot of this gas has also migrated towards the surface and become trapped in shallower pockets, the same ones being tapped for domestic water (see point #1). Most gas fields around the country are primarily in shale units and the depths are much greater. <strong>The geology of the gas field is the major player in the potential for gas, water, or fracturing fluids to end up in domestic supplies and is constantly overlooked.</strong></p>

<p>3) Hydraulic fracturing has been used in the gas industry for over 40 years... If it was as damaging as it&#39;s claimed, you&#39;d think that we could find some actual evidence for groundwater contamination. There isn&#39;t a widely accepted study that says it has. (Please feel free to correct me if this has changed in the past few months, but make sure it wasn&#39;t actually rebuffed after the fact.)</p>

<p>4) Fracturing itself hasn&#39;t been linked to increased seismic activity, wastewater injection has. (And as pointed out above, it&#39;s not the removal of wastewater, it&#39;s the placement.) Oil and gas wells develop a lot of water in the process, sometimes more water than the oil and gas combined. Disposing of the water on site is the cheapest and easiest way for a company get rid of the wastewater and it is often injected in separate wells near the oil and gas field. Sometimes the water is used to push more oil and gas into the production well, but I digress. The wastewater is trapped thousands of feet below domestic aquifers and is buffered from those wells by thousands of feet of low-permeability rock (meaning the fluids are trapped and sealed). But yes, I believe that there is significant evidence to support the theory that wasterwater injection (which also happens at sites that aren&#39;t fractured) has increased the seismicity near oil and gas fields.</p>

<p>5) Now think of this for a second... Hydraulic fracturing fluids are forced into the production wells with sand and water (mostly these two items). The fluids and sand help to create micro-fractures that help the wells produce at higher rates (fractured wells are usually 2-3 times more productive than non-fractured wells in the same area, which means less wells overall). After fracturing, the wells are put into production and the oil and gas is &quot;sucked&quot; from the formation into the well. The fracturing fluids are then pulled right back into the well, along with the oil and gas. All of the fluids are taken right back out of the ground. The only way for these fluids to escape and get trapped in the formation is through bad well design. But, bad well design is bad for production and is fixed because it loses money.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a geologist, but I don&#39;t work for an oil and gas company; but, I did work for a State agency reviewing environmental concerns over hydraulic fracturing. I saw some greedy people trying to get some cash out of the oil and gas companies, but I never saw hard scientific evidence for the degradation of groundwater supplies due to hydraulic fracturing.</p>

<p>tl;dr Hydraulic fracturing has been on-going for over 4 decades and there still isn&#39;t proof that it has contaminated any domestic water supplies, anywhere. Wastewater injection related to all oil and gas production (with or without fracturing) likely causes earthquakes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a geologist (not in the oil/gas industry) I find it very frustrating the amount of incorrect information that is out there concerning the potential problems with fracturing. As a result of public outcry the EPA is even working on a study <a href="http://www.epa.gov/hfstudy/">to determine potential impacts of drinking water resources</a>. Another decent resource to learn more about hydraulic fracturing: <a href="http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/oil-gas/publications/epreports/shale_gas_primer_2009.pdf">Modern Shale Gas Development in the United States: A Primer</a></p>

<p>I wish that the general public would learn the facts. Yes, there are some things to be concerned about with the increasing number of hydraulic fracturing treatments being conducted. Unfortunately most people I have talked to have no idea what the real potential problems are and just make a lot of noise repeating uniformed propaganda.</p>

You&#39;re bound to find somebody that is for or against for whatever subject you choose to pick. Not everyone that doesn&#39;t support your point of view is a &quot;paid shill&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Yahoo_bot is right that it&#39;s terrible when used near underground water supply. But, how do you avoid that? Also, it&#39;s not just about the natural gas near the water. It&#39;s the reportedly up to 750 other <a href="http://fracfocus.org/chemical-use/what-chemicals-are-used">Chemicals</a> that are used. The source I linked for the chemicals is only one of many available. I haven&#39;t searched extensively for a complete list. But, there are many available in varying sizes around the net.</p>

<p>Edit: Regarding the chemicals it seems that full disclosure on a complete list is being stalled by government. If it&#39;s no big deal to health and safety why stall?</p>

<p>Also, here are a couple maps.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2012/finalwebsite/images/groundwater3.jpg">map</a> shows where all the aquifers in the US are.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://earthjustice.org/features/campaigns/fracking-across-the-united-states">map</a>  Illustrates the areas with multiple wells and areas for possible future drilling.</p>

<p>I too was completely ignorant as to what fracking even was. So, when I saw <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phCibwj396I">Gasland</a> Come up for free on Amazon Prime. I watched it. Is it one sided? Sure, it&#39;s a documentary bringing attention to the negatives of fracking. But, a couple things are pretty simple to understand that you can take away from this.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>1-7million gallons of &quot;Produced&quot; water is used <strong>per</strong> well. Wells are relatively close to eachother with some homeowners able to see as many as six from their doorstep. Produced water is water containing the slew of chemicals. Many of which are known to cause severe medical conditions. And it&#39;s reported in this video that roughly half of the water stays in the ground.</p></li>
<li><p>If a company has to be given immunity from any Environmental Protection laws... And they are.</p></li>
<li><p>Haliburton is just one of the companies involved in fracking. And good ol&#39; Mr. Dick Cheney whom used to work for them is directly involved in not only granting evironmental immunity but also making sure that these companies are able to drill pretty much anywhere to include Americas Preserves.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Maybe you can dismiss the fact that many people are able to light their water on fire. You can justify it with the needs of the many vs the suffering of the few. But, you can&#39;t control where these chemicals go. Once the waters in the ground... it might as well be lost. It&#39;s a part of the water supply at that point.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a slew of other interesting facts regarding the fracking industry in the video. If they&#39;re all true fracking is a mistake. But, again. My source is one sided.</p>

<p>Just tell the truth, go with your gut instinct, and if it turns out you are wrong, aplogize. Do try to listen to the other sides arguments, one of the marks of fakes is that even when informed by some item of tuth which is pretty much proved and unarguable, they wll ignore it and go on spouting their disinformation. An actual himan being will usually at least consider a piece of information that doesn&#39;t fit and wonder, perhaps, they were wrong. And you can tell the difference. Usually.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I routinely defend my opinions on Reddit, and am not a shill. I think way too many people here don&#39;t understand that half of Reddit is being a place to argue on the internet. This is just a guy, spreading the opinion of most people in the field that fracking is not harmful. You have an oil well a few inches think, a mile below the Earth, separated by impenetrable rock. The only dangers come from contamination during the drilling, releasing toxic substances already underground into the ground water, or a poor cement job that allows the well to break and release the chemicals. Essentially there&#39;s always danger with drilling, but fracking barely adds to that danger.</p>

<p>easy boy. I have drilled through faults before, to say they don&#39;t come to the surface is a lie. I have seen a &quot;Frack&quot; fountain shoot up from the middle of a farmers field. No where near an artesian well.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m tired of misinformed people spreading nonsense, so i&#39;m going to repeat something i have posted several times before.  i don&#39;t know about you, but i like it when issues are decided on through science rather than wild speculation.</p>

<p>professional geologists here who has never worked in the oil/gas industry. there is no risk of contaminating aquifers from the actual fracking process itself. by definition, fracking requires a completely self contained system: you can&#39;t have leaks if you want to produce pressure. then once the fractures have been produced, you still can&#39;t have leaks, or else you won&#39;t be able to recover the hydrocarbons. fracking fluids are engineered and injected at precise pressures to induce fractures only within the target formation, then the oil/gas can flow into a completely contained well, which is separated from aquifers by steel casing. target formations are separated from the fresh water zone by 100s to 1000s of feet of rock, and there absolutely must be an impermeable cap rock above the target, otherwise the fracking process won&#39;t work. if a fracture were to propagate all the way to the top of the target (which fracking engineers make sure does not happen, to maximize recovery), there will still be impermeable cap rock above. it takes fluids 10s to 100s of thousands of years to flow through shales/mudstones, and those are everywhere in the subsurface.</p>

<p>fracking has been going on all the time since the 1970s, and there is no evidence of the actual fracking process contaminating drinking water, ever. however, water has been contaminated when drilling companies have done poor cementing/casing jobs through the fresh water zone. this can happen regardless of whether or not fracking occurs. but guess what, nearly every oil/gas well drilled in the past 40 years has been fracked. even a lot of water wells are fracked.</p>

<p>in my opinion, the solution is simple: we need national regulations on cementing/casing jobs, a requirement to show the presence of a solid cap rock, and a mandate for completely self contained fluid injection/recovery systems.</p>

<p>Tap water has been bursting into flames for years because of methane, and the cool part is, with some relatively simple tests, we can tell if the methane is a result of drilling, or it is naturally occurring. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anybody is claiming that fracking companies are innocent, but I do find it curious that people jump on the band wagon to protest fracking, meanwhile nobody gives a shit about coal polluting the air, depleted uranium contaminating ground water, or hydro power destroying ecosystems.</p>

Microsoft is quite guilty of it trying to convince consumers that they aren&#39;t getting ripped off from the abortion called Windows 8.  And &#39;astroturfing&#39; even became a buzzword when republicans and democrats entered into m.a.d. revealing the secret publicly in an attempt to gain an upper hand (of which ultimately neither did).</p>

<p>Though the more I think about it, I think they made the buzzword and revealed the practice publicly to somewhat legitimize the practice as perhaps not ethical, but acceptable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t make that claim, its common knowledge. This is a whole industry you are talking about here. Your asking me to &quot;prove it&quot; is ridiculous. I don&#39;t have the time to go searching back through all the web pages and newspaper articles Ive read, but Ive probably read, just guessing, ten articles about it, and heard it mentioned countless times. A friend of mine, decades ago was working in the advertising industry and he worked for one of these firms for a while, we used to joke about it. That was not on the Internet, though that was pre-internet..</p>

<p>I suspect he still is knowledgeable about it, although I haven&#39;t spoken with him in years, he would know.</p>

<p>Certain PR firms, are heavily involved in this kind of thing. Read &quot;Toxic Sludge is Good for You&quot; (book) - thats about &quot;greenwashing&quot; and &quot;astroturf&quot; - Those two words would probably find you some stuff to go on.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t make it a practice of investigating too deeply into this, I am not some kind of muckracker. I am just wasting time on here.. should blog less.</p>

<p>A thought..</p>

<p>That said, I saw a sort of tell all article by somebody formerly in the (US) health insurance disinfo campaign on either Guardian.com, the Independent or the Telegraph (big UK papers) probably around 2009 or 2010. And that was a big article with a lot of information. I don&#39;t have the URL, sorry.</p>

<p>The title was something like &quot;I was a&quot;.... It was during the so called debate in the USA on the &quot;affordable care&quot; act but it was in the British press. It was not on the BBC. I think it was probably the Guardian but I am not sure.</p>

<p>If I am trying to convince you its because I think that this kind of thing is a threat to democracy&#39;s functioning.. It makes no difference to me whether you believe these people are everywhere on the Internet because its clear that they are, and your or my believing in them makes no difference to the situation.. </p>

<p>The poisoning of discussions is poisoning our democracy. Its making appearance more important than substance and in that respect, its a threat to the functioning of any democracy.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t believe in these people&#39;s existence or ability to poison issues, ASK ANY POLITICIAN.</p>

<p>But, certain kinds of issues immediately attract these kinds of people, reliably, and the way they respond is predictable.</p>

<p>That is where you are wrong, because you are not all seeing, you are making a blanket statement there, not me. Your statement is that these things &quot;don&#39;t exist&quot;, my statement is that they do. The likelihood of them not existing is virtually nil. the amount of them may be debatable.. but I never professed to know much about them beyond one particular area.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me be clear: There is no such thing as &quot;paid shills&quot; who

<p>Well, there you just <strong>limited your previous argument drastically* when you had not before. Why would those people come to r/conspiracy? What reason would people come to a place with a name that immediately says &quot;dont take me too seriously&quot;?  - That I hope would make most of those people want to find other discussions where they would seem more credible.. But, what do I know, maybe I am completely wrong. I just don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t profess to know- **about r/conspiracy</strong></p>

<p>I am new here and to be honest, some (most) of the arguments made by &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; just seem to me to be wrong, but, I value the fact that at least now, we (here in the US) still have the freedom to share our half baked theories, which is what I was trying to do. Speculation.</p>

<p>And I am qualifying the things I am saying, giving you the additional information that I would want to attribute your own level of credibility to the truth or untruth of what I am saying, as I did, which is what I would expect from others. Rather than trying to make the decision for you, as you seem to be trying to do with me.</p>

<p>Google is your friend, because its hard to spam and it gives somewhat illustrative statistically parse able results.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, at least you have a job in your chosen field, and that is definitely a good thing. Geology is pretty interesting, I wish I knew more about it. What little I know is nice to have when I travel around, as it makes observing the world around me a little more interesting. </p>

<p>The geological history of this planet is really something. </p>

<p>The sinkhole I am not really following as closely now as I was at the beginning because I thought that the methane coming out of it might have had some origin in these deposits off of the continental shelves (I think this area is alluvial, which is to say that at one time I think it was offshore, not on land) however, it seems as if the problem with methane perhaps (I am just going from what I had read) originated in an underground salt dome that was being used for storage of natural gas.. not the methane ice.. and its an offshoot of this altogether regrettable and horrid situation, not some kind of planet-changing event.. </p>

<p>There is a lot of coverage of it at <a href="http://enenews.com">http://enenews.com</a> - you can&#39;t miss it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know where I would want to live with climate change.. I think about that a lot, actually. </p>

<p>Really, the most important thing is being able to support one&#39;s self and to have a good community..people who are positive influences on you.. an environment where you will want to be engaged in the community..</p>

<p>That will keep your brain engaged.. thats the most important thing, really. also, sustainability of the basics of life..</p>

<p>Far inland, you never know, in terms of hot and cold, the weather is much more potentially extreme than on the coasts.. But of course on the coasts they have storms, tsunamis, every place has its good and bad issues..</p>
