First, I guess many can kinda agree that we&#39;re not alone in the universe. I&#39;ve seen what you would call a flying saucer first hand and that experience really lit up alot of questions in my mind.
One of my thoughts are about our current situation on planet Earth, how we&#39;re being fundamentally dictated to and how the &quot;global banking elite&quot; is running the show. We&#39;re seeing alot of tyranny and destruction about and it makes me think that someone should have intervened and helped us out by now. </p>

<p>Do you think there could be such a thing as an intergalactic treaty that prevents any alien race from interfering with the developement of another planet? And do you think anyone will ever come to our aid in any way? Or maybe they will prove to be as evil as our &quot;rulers&quot; and bring about even worse situations?
Again, I&#39;d appreciate others opinions on this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They already have come to our aid, they deal with genetics. All living things on earth have been cataloged and nothing will be lost. Multiple entities are engaging us and this is a cluster fuck for our governments because there are no easy or straightforward answers. </p>

<p>Our nuclear ambitions are of the utmost concern to many of them, this is why they have intervened over multiple nuclear sights but that answer is a long one and im sure you are aware of the RAF Bentwaters incident. No coincidence that Roswell happened so close to the white sand testing range either, it&#39;s there if you look for it and do your homework. </p>

<p>If you would like an alternative theory to UFO phenomena i would always recommend Jacques Vallée&#39;s work, in my view he is a true pioneer in the field and his work should not be ignored. </p>

<p>They will not land until we learn to &#39;do something collectively&#39;.At this time we are not doing it and most of that inaction is down to the governments and oil barons. </p>

<p>I could go on for some time but i would probably start to bore you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries about boring me. In my humble opinion, things of alien nature is the most fascinating subject out there, I could talk/hear about for it hours. So theoretically, if we were to overthrow our governments, we could have a real chance to be united with other life forms? Not 100% sure, but it looks like humanity is slowly waking up, and nothing makes me happier. How long do you think it will take before it&#39;s all disclosed?

    <div class="md"><p>I know one thing that could seriously screw over the power of the elites and that is permaculture (permanent agriculture). Think about how our world works right now. We are completely dependent on others for everything: food, water, clothing, shelter. With the technology of today we can create a permaculture society. Sprinkler systems can water the plants for us and most people already have homes. Think about how big the average backyard is today and how that can be used to grow your own food. We can break away from this system if we just start doing things ourselves again. Our ancestors did it with no technology. With our technology we can do anything.</p>

<p>There are also a good amount of videos online that you can check out. See if you can locate the British Unsolved Mysteries episode on it. I actually had the chance to interview Col. Charles Halt in June for a UFO documentary that I am helping produce. He says that Unsolved Mysteries told the most accurate story on the case. Look up the Charles Halt Audio Tapes as well. You can find it on YouTube. He was actually recording the majority of the encounter, narrating everything he was seeing. It&#39;s all very interesting. He is a really cool dude. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t fully remember if there was writing on the craft, but there possibly could&#39;ve been. The one thing that Col. Halt said to me that really stood out was that the craft seemed to come from the ground and as it was rising it looked as if it was dripping molten metal. The tape is really interesting to listen to because you get to hear the panic, shock, and excitement as it&#39;s happening. There was another gentlemen there that took pictures. Only two or so survived. There were also marks in the trees that the craft had left and they actually made three molds of the markings. Two of them were stolen. Col. Halt has the last remaining one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol no dude, he is a French Ufologist of much renown and respect. He argued the idea of &#39;meta-terrestrials&#39;. The notion that the extraterrestrial hypothesis was flawed by its own strangeness and sometimes absurdity. That there is a real possibility that UFO phenomena is multi dimensional and has been prevalent throughout history in different forms. </p>

<p>So, a couple of hundred years ago you get abducted by &#39;demons or angels&#39;, but in the 21st century we get abducted my spacemen, as our understanding of the universe has changed so has our understanding of UFO phenomena. </p>

<p>He argued that it is a control mechanism, almost as if it is guiding us in some way. </p>

<p>Read &#39;Messengers of Deception&#39; if you can. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I enjoyed reading that. I&#39;d be interested in your opinion on the role of natural psychedelic plants, mushrooms and DMT especially.</p>

<p>I cannot assume that you are interested in this stuff, but Terrence Mckenna argues that &#39;magic mushrooms&#39; may have had an accelerating effect on our evolution; driving language, creativity and non-egoic patterns of behaviour. He also talks about the mushrooms alien like qualities, in it&#39;s physical appearance, chemical structure, and even the experience itself. </p>

<p>Quite frequently he describes it as a tool for a communication with the intelligent &#39;other&#39;, and i firmly believe myself that these plants can be hugely illuminating. </p>

<p>Do you think that these plants may have been placed here for our development? It&#39;s a fairly rudimentary way of looking at it, but I find it to be a fascinating coincidence that naturally occurring plants that induce out of this world experiences may be and can be vital for our spiritual development on a personal and societal level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all about intelligence brother. We know ants communicate in their own way - we do too but at a different level. It&#39;s all about being seen at eye level. The universe is a big place and only voyager has been further than our galaxy. We truly don&#39;t know until anything until an alien speaks up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think humanity, specifically the US govt., has contacted visitors (that might not have come from <em>far</em> but from <em>sideways</em>, that is, other dimensions) and are dealing with them in order to advance their own agendas. I think no one is still naive enough to expect the <em>&#39;space brothers bringing peace and solving humanity&#39;s troubles&#39;</em> scenario. They must want something from us or this environment, and offering shiny beads and some useful tools in exchange. </p>

<p>Do I think they run the show now, geopolitically-wise? Maybe in a way. Maybe accomodating their demands end up as the dictates from financial and political powers that in turn set the guidelines for humanity&#39;s fate. Maybe their actions here don&#39;t command us directly but governments must take actions based on the repercussions of those, or to prevent them from happening. Maybe there is already a war against them and all the billions gone down the drain in supposed inefficient expenditure from the governments and pilfered by financial robber barons is going into secret research for how to defend us.</p>

<p>Plus, we have to consider that if alien life is possible, then there must be more than one species contacting us. More than one, and all of them with specific, perhaps conflicting agendas.</p>

<p>I&#39;d wish to live to 10,000 years so I could read the history books dealing with the real, undisclosed events of the 20th and 21st century. I&#39;m sure we all would have quite many surprises.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ah, here&#39;s a fun theory. What if the aliens are already here. Maybe even underground. What if they were here before us? What if aliens are playing a part of the world system, moving us off of gold currencies to slip our gold (Which is an excellent conductor) of world, or to use it for their tech? I would talk more, but it&#39;s just a theory I toy with. I&#39;m tired.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>First, I guess many can kinda agree that we&#39;re not alone in the universe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCMp9dZQdZA"><em>Beyond</em> correct</a>, as a matter of fact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve seen what you would call a flying saucer first hand and that experience really lit up alot of questions in my mind</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In which case - although it <em>could</em> have been terrestrial - there&#39;s a good chance it was <em>extra</em>terrestrial and you are one of the growing number of people who can say that you don&#39;t &quot;believe&quot; we&#39;re not alone.  You <em>know</em> - or at least have valid, first-hand, in-your-face experience - that we&#39;re not alone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of my thoughts are about our current situation on planet Earth, how we&#39;re being fundamentally dictated to and how the &quot;global banking elite&quot; is running the show.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/hidden_hand_081018">Boom</a>, my friend.  Boom.  Shit gets <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14utv0/911_was_an_occult_megaritual_the_numbers_of_the_4/c7gwqaz"><em>extremely</em> deep</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re seeing alot of tyranny and destruction about and it makes me think that someone should have intervened and helped us out by now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are various things that can be said to this.</p>

<ul>
<li>ETs have <em>already</em> intervened.  They&#39;re intervening <em>now</em> as we speak.  Matter of fact, they&#39;ve been intervening with us since before we were even here on this planet.  Thing is that some of the ETs that are intervening here aren&#39;t necessarily intervening for our benefit.  They may be farming us and utilizing us as a resource to take advantage of.  In other words, intervention has taken place, but it&#39;s not <em>good</em> intervention.  It&#39;s...not so good intervention.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another thing that can be said is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Humans are not at all the preeminent or most important organism on planet Earth.  The planet <em>herself</em> is.  Most ETs advanced enough to have mastered interstellar travel know this.  As such, they may be monitoring us - true - but they aren&#39;t as interested in &quot;saving&quot; the human race or &quot;watching out for our welfare&quot; as much as they are interested in the welfare of the real and <em>true</em> divine presence on planet Earth - namely Earth herself.  Gaia.  As such, we&#39;re not being interfered with because those monitoring activities here don&#39;t really give a fuck about us.  They don&#39;t care whether we are stupid enough to blow ourselves up to smithereens or not (stupid, moronic assholes that we are).  They just want to make sure we don&#39;t fuck up <em>Mother Earth</em> too badly.  If we end up giving her a &quot;tummy ache&quot; with our shitty actions, then I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll interfere too much with even that - so long as we kill ourselves off in the process (&quot;Good bye, good riddance, dumb assholes&quot; they might say).  If we start doing some shit that might REALLY irreparably damage her, however (like maybe a full on, all out nuclear war amongst nations, etc), then those beings monitoring action here on this planet might step in at that point and put a stop to it.  There&#39;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmh2NJxc3BQ">very valid evidence that this has happened already</a>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think there could be such a thing as an intergalactic treaty that prevents any alien race from interfering with the developement of another planet?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  I strongly feel this is the case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And do you think anyone will ever come to our aid in any way?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They already have.  Many times.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or maybe they will prove to be as evil as our &quot;rulers&quot; and bring about even worse situations?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of &quot;our rulers&quot; might not be as human as some of us might think they are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nearly all the ET civilizations out there are highly developed spiritually and ethically. The have a strict code of conduct similar to the &quot;Prime Directive&quot; in Star Trek in that they don&#39;t overtly interfere with with fledgling planets like Earth. </p>

<p>In ages past when Earth was more primitive it appears that more overt influence was allowed. That is why you have so many legends or myths of the &quot;Gods coming down from the Heavens&quot;.</p>

<p>Currently though such overt influence is not allowed. We are going through an &quot;individuation&quot; phase as a civilization where we need to figure out for ourselves what is right and what is wrong.</p>

<p>It is claimed that even today they still support us and have intervened for our benefit indirectly and covertly many times. For example they prevented nuclear war during the Cold War period (as evidence of this they made a huge Sri Yantra pattern in a dry lake bed in Oregon after the end of the Cold War). </p>

<p>They also claim to have mitigated the effects of our environmental pollution (including the effects of nuclear test blasts, chemtrails, loss of the ozone layer etc.). Also it is claimed they recently removed nearly all the deep underground military bases (DUMBs) of the elites where they were going to hide in the case of the nuclear war and where they kept all their equipment to stage an (faked) Alien Invasion. </p>

<p>They also say they &quot;convert&quot; our negative energy thoughts into Earthquakes so that they get released without doing too much harm.</p>

<p>The main form of support though is on the spiritual planes such as channeling information to &quot;Light Workers&quot;. They have highly advanced techniques of manipulating reality, so it is hard to say how much or how little influence they actually have. I think they have the power to do really a lot, but they are restraining themselves and respecting our Free Will as this is a fundamental condition of our Universe.</p>

<p>They purposely let the Cabal (negative Elite) rule the planet for the past few thousand years or so as this was a necessary or planned part of the developement of Earth. An experience and something from which to learn, so to speak. That time is ending now and - they say - that we are heading to a Golden Age of Enlightenment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The possibility fascinates me, but I can&#39;t think of a reason why advanced alien lifeforms would interact with us. Thats not to say that there isn&#39;t a reason, but any beings which could travel through space or interdimensionally doesn&#39;t need our help developing technology or acquiring resources. </p>

<p>The biggest reasons I can imagine for us to be visited would be for anthropological observation, or maybe even entertainment. I doubt they would interfere much with human society. Do humans often interfere with colonies of ants? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was as a friends house, he lives at a remote farm in the outskirts of town. It was a very small flying object, glowing in a dark green color. It looked just like a traditional flying saucer, but kindof a miniature version. It flew back and forth, towards us and then back away from us again, as if it was observing us. When it flew, it was faster than my eyes were able to keep up with. It was hanging around for maybe 2 minutes, before it just vanished.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen something strange on another occation as well, I guess I can call it a UFO. It was a small white object, looked sort of like a ball of energy hovering above ground. My friend and I thought it was interesting and tried to walk towards it, and that&#39;s when things got weird. As we got closer and closer to the object, it was like some force pushed us away, my knees felt weaker and I felt lightheaded.</p>

<p>It all may sound weird, so it&#39;s worth mentioning that I was not on any form of drugs or under the influence of alcohol during any of the experiences.

    <div class="md"><p>I was smoking a cig out in my backyard one night. An orb of light roughly larger than a softball made its way to my yard following the creek that separated the neighbors yards. Upon noticing me it hovered around 30-40 feet away from me about 7 feet off the ground. It felt like it was observing me. I stood paralyzed for around half a minute as it hovered much like a bee would. Finally as I started to walk toward the orb it flew off. It&#39;s movements were similar to a bees is the only way I can describe it. This was at approximately mid night. I was sober. </p>

<p>However, <a href="http://veilofreality.com/2011/03/12/ufos-aliens-and-the-question-of-contact-%E2%98%9E-video/">http://veilofreality.com/2011/03/12/ufos-aliens-and-the-question-of-contact-%E2%98%9E-video/</a></p>

<p>I have read and watched 100s of videos and books on the topic with the help of other researchers, I can vouch for this being as close as you can come on the topic.</p>

<p>I really hope this gets the attention it deserves.</p>
