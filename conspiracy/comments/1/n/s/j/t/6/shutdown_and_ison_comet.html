<p>Not sure if joking, but it raised a few questions in my head.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is that section of government really affected?</li>
<li>Is there any other sources tracking ISON comet from other countries?</li>
<li>If not could ISON be False Flag event?</li>

    <div class="md"><p>You guys want to know why they shut it down?</p>

<p>Watch the Joe Rogan questions eveything episode where the guy learned how to use the space fence to track NASA&#39;s craft&#39;s, satellites, asteroids.. etc.. coincidentally it was shutdown just shortly after that episode aired I believe. </p>

<p>That thing was a total threat on every level for an outsider to gain access to and snoop around with.</p>

look  east when the sun comes up. </p>

<p>I think it is real but I find it very very odd that the day (OCT 1) it is coming into view with good telescopes for NASA. it gets shut down. 
The govt. is like, well fuck everything... like the world is ending or something crazy is gonna happen.. oh.. wait.... you mean in November the comet will have passed almost DIRECTLY in front of our orbit leaving a huge 2x dust cloud/trail and also possible debris.... also we have had a huge uptick in fire balls on earth.. oh and more specifically the mid west Americas. ... <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0309/images/fb_main.jpg">hmmmm.........</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I speculated on this and was downvoted, my understanding of big bodies coming in from the oort cloud. They usually have friends with them. Here was the comment:   Complete speculation here, but what about the possibility of a series NEO-Earth very large asteroids, which would be the equivalent to a shotgun blast from the Oort cloud happening in the next ten days. We all remember what happened when that meteor went over Russia, I can&#39;t remember how big it was, but it&#39;s arrival coincided with DA14 quite serindipidously if you recall. These two asteroids are pretty big and one of them coming on the 5th Oct makes its closest approach SU24 2013 @ 5 (LD) = .0132 something like 1,194,500 miles or 1,922,000 Km = .0132 (AU), and one on the 7th Oct SC21 2013 @ 8.8 (LD) 2,102,320 miles 3,382,720 Km= 0.0227 (AU). From these recent events and NASA recently shut down its outward looking space radar or Space Fence seems like a plausible theory to me, whataya think? I used RT.com on the last link to protest <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> for having been subverted by r/conspiritard inbreeds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even when cobbling together your pseudo-science you are incapable of getting basic facts right.  At least it makes it easy to dismiss your other points since you are clearly ignorant regarding even the most basic aspects of your &quot;theory&quot;.</p>

<p>How is it that somebody who isn&#39;t capable of even basic fact checking is confident in their wild speculations about government motivations related to celestial events on a massive scale.  You can&#39;t even properly name who shut down the <strong>Air Force Space Surveillance System</strong>.  I&#39;ll give you a hint, it&#39;s included in the name.  Furthermore, you aren&#39;t even able look up how big the asteroid was that became a meteor over Russia, yet somehow you&#39;re able to postulate about mass ejections of &quot;NEO-Earth very large asteroids&quot; from the Oort cloud?  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll stick to listening to people who are capable of doing basic research and analysis rather than wild speculation on the basis of nothing but poorly researched pseudo-science.</p>

<p>I would put you on ignore, but somebody needs to call out your baffling attempts at intelligence so that ignorance doesn&#39;t spread like wildfire around here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough.  </p>

<p>Then my theory is that ISON actually hit the planet Earth in 498BC and we are all living in a collective limbo without realizing it.  According to my calculations (2013AD + 498BC = 2511years, 2+5+1+1=9, 9x498=4482, 4482 divided by 24 hours = 186.75 days) and within ~186.75 days Indian elephants will gain the ability to speak and be the ones to reveal the actual truth.  Unfortunately nobody will believe their one true truth because their tusks are getting in the way.  </p>

<p>But it&#39;s just a theory, so I can spout whatever stupidity I want right!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if there wasn&#39;t the shutdown, I recall hearing that one or more of NASA&#39;s programs were shutdown, one due to loss of communication to a satellite. Luckily, astronomy is huge. We don&#39;t need to entirely rely on NASA. Other countries have their own eyes on the sky, and there are enough amateur astronomers to cover the rest. If I recall correctly, NASA even called on amateur astronomers to volunteer their time for studies, because there are so many and they can cover most of the sky at any given time. And besides that, we&#39;ll be able to see it with the naked eye. It&#39;s not like it can sneak up on us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I commented on this on the 29th. NASA was pretty excited to start getting images of ISON from the mars orbiter satellite as well as the rover. They reported this.. Then day of the shutdown everything goes dark. Could be a coincidence.. But with the planned grid shutdown on the 13th of November and all the info about ISON causing magnetic and electrical issues... Starting to get curious myself. I saw a video an amateur made of mars from October 1st that showed a definite disturbance in the magnetic field.. On phone can&#39;t link. Search YouTube. There are a few claiming the same thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, there are two other things to worry about:</p>

<p>(1) If ISON breaks up while sungrazing.  ISON is supposed to pass directly over the north pole on it&#39;s return trip.  If it breaks up, all bets are off</p>

<p>(2) If there is anything at all to the &quot;electric universe&quot; theory (e.g. that all bodies in space are charged and quite dramatically differently than one another), then ISON may interfere with the sun&#39;s magnetic field.  Since it will be leaving the SUN on a direct course towards us (it will pass over the north pole), it may cause a series of significant CME events that are aimed at the earth as stops it&#39;s sungrazing.</p>

<p>Oh, I almost forgot to mention;  The SUN is supposed to have a magnetic field reversal at the same time ISON is passing.  <strong>WTF ?</strong>   --  There is a good article on the NASA website about this, but the NASA website is shut down.  <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/08/130807-sun-magnetic-field-reversal-space-weather/">Here is an alternate source</a>  and <a href="http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/science/2013/09/the-suns-magnetic-field-is-about-to-reverse/">another source</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Comets certainly have an effect on the Sun i.e. CMEs but not that big of an effect to be the thing that makes the suns poles flip and I do subscribe to the electric universe model.  Because the comet is a first timer, it is very negatively charged so the comet will be the one that acts violently when entering the suns environment; the sun could really care less about that small of an object no matter the strength of the negative charge.  (just I.M.O. either one of us could be right or wrong)</p>

<p>But I do hear what you are saying, good points, I am sticking with just being mainly worried about the debris field. </p>
