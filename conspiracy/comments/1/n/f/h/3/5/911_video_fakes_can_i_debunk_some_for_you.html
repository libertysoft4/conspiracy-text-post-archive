    <div class="md"><p>There are people who genuinely believe that no planes hit the towers on 9/11. That every single piece of video of that event is the result of computer manipulation.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t buy into any of the alternative 9/11 theories, but those ones are among the most outlandish.. Although they&#39;re also within my area of expertise, so I&#39;m oddly fascinated by them.</p>

<p>See the two videos I linked in reply to <a href="/u/Viper6018">/u/Viper6018</a> if you&#39;re interested in those theories and the videos they feel are faked (and how they&#39;ve &quot;proven&quot; so).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have heard this before from one source I do listen to very carefully.  Not because of the outlandish things they claim but over the years what they have said have come true.</p>

<p>One thing I&#39;ve heard is that the buildings where bombarded with an energy weapon as well as explosives.  Known as the Hutchison Effect.  Here&#39;s a small video about it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5zbTnfGe3E">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5zbTnfGe3E</a></p>

<p>This is new to me.  And I tend to believe this theory more and more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Judy Wood&#39;s opinions on the collapse are also considered pretty fringe.</p>

<p>She basically hypothesizes that some sort of theoretical &quot;directed energy weapon&quot; was responsible for the buildings&#39; collapses.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve really not spent much time on it because it&#39;s so far outside what seems like a plausible reality. There&#39;s no specifics on what the weapon is, how it would operates, where it came from, etc etc etc.. It doesn&#39;t seem to me to be much better than the idea that UFO&#39;s did it (and yes, I believe some people have seriously suggested that).</p>

<p>I believe that a number of other prominent 9/11 Truth groups have debunked it in the past also. But then again, perhaps they&#39;re really government shills intending to keep the <em>real</em> plot under wraps ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, I love that answer. The level of infighting among those believing in alternative 9/11 theories is pretty incredible at times. Similarly they often level similar accusations at those behind the more &quot;mainstream&quot; conspiracy theories, for example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The people behind &quot;In plane site&quot;, just like those behind &quot;Loose change&quot; and all those &quot;conspiracy&quot; movies of the sort, are cointel agents whose main purpose is to drive the people with questions into blind alleys...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(From the September Clues forums)</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to accuse people of being shills, but in practice it&#39;s just a No True Scotsman fallacy isn&#39;t it? The &quot;No Plane&quot; theories are actually pretty low key in the 9/11 truth movement. If they were intended to be some sort of disinfo surely they&#39;d be much more high profile?</p>

<p>I have no reason to believe that the people claiming to believe these theories aren&#39;t being honest. I&#39;ve even encountered them in the comments on Reddit threads.</p>

<p>And now you have every reason, but I&#39;m sure you will fabricate some excuse in order to maintain cognitive dissonance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cass_Sunstein#.22Conspiracy_Theories.22_and_government_infiltration">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cass_Sunstein#.22Conspiracy_Theories.22_and_government_infiltration</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sunstein co-authored a 2008 paper with Adrian Vermeule, titled &quot;Conspiracy Theories,&quot; dealing with the risks and possible government responses to false conspiracy theories resulting from &quot;cascades&quot; of faulty information within groups that may ultimately lead to violence. In this article they wrote, &quot;The existence of both domestic and foreign conspiracy theories, we suggest, is no trivial matter, posing real risks to the government’s antiterrorism policies, whatever the latter may be.&quot; </p>

<p>They go on to propose that, &quot;the best response consists in cognitive infiltration of extremist groups&quot;,[29] where they suggest, among other tactics, &quot;Government agents (and their allies) might enter chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups and attempt to undermine percolating conspiracy theories by raising doubts about their factual premises, causal logic or implications for political action.&quot;[29] They refer, several times, to groups that promote the view that the US Government was responsible or complicit in the September 11 attacks as &quot;extremist groups.&quot;</p>

<p>The authors declare that there are five responses a government can take toward conspiracy theories: &quot;We can readily imagine a series of possible responses. <strong>(1) Government might ban conspiracy theorizing. (2) Government might impose some kind of tax, financial or otherwise, on those who disseminate such theories. (3) Government might itself engage in counterspeech, marshaling arguments to discredit conspiracy theories. (4) Government might formally hire credible private parties to engage in counterspeech. (5) Government might engage in informal communication with such parties, encouraging them to help.&quot; However, the authors advocate that each &quot;instrument has a distinctive set of potential effects, or costs and benefits, and each will have a place under imaginable conditions. However, our main policy idea is that government should engage in cognitive infiltration of the groups that produce conspiracy theories, which involves a mix of (3), (4) and (5).&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Sunstein and Vermeule also analyze the practice of recruiting &quot;nongovernmental officials&quot;; they suggest that &quot;government can supply these independent experts with information and perhaps prod them into action from behind the scenes,&quot; further warning that &quot;too close a connection will be self-defeating if it is exposed.&quot;[29] Sunstein and Vermeule argue that the practice of enlisting non-government officials, &quot;might ensure that credible independent experts offer the rebuttal, rather than government officials themselves. There is a tradeoff between credibility and control, however. The price of credibility is that government cannot be seen to control the independent experts.&quot; This position has been criticized by some commentators,[30][31] who argue that it would violate prohibitions on government propaganda aimed at domestic citizens.[32] Sunstein and Vermeule&#39;s proposed infiltrations have also been met by sharply critical scholarly critiques.[33][34][35]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The majority of the claims are covered in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rml2TL5N8ds">part 7</a> of Ace Baker&#39;s American Psy-opera (45 minutes) and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWl8mUSDIwU">September Clues</a> (1 hour 31 minutes).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve watched all of Ace Baker&#39;s video and, frankly, way too much of September Clues. Like I say - nothing compelling if you understand video technology. Also a LOT of misunderstandings or deliberate lies in those videos (you choose).</p>

<p>As a side note, if you&#39;re planning to make some documentary video about some conspiracy you believe in, or evidence you think you&#39;ve discovered - please aim to be concise! It seem to take people 15 minutes on YouTube just to dissect one 30 second TV news clip... If I made TV shows like that I&#39;d lose my job :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This argument is a lost cause and people would do best to avoid using it as proof that 9/11 official story is a lie due to the simple fact that the debunkers (or the people that believe in the official story) will simply state that airplane parts have been found, the holes in the buildings have the exact shape of an aircraft impact.</p>

<p>The only way I see it possible to debate this subject in a rational way is by considering that those were indeed aircrafts crashing into the towers and go with the evidence that doesn&#39;t seem to support the claim, for example: Why is there a flash before impact that can be seen from multiple positioned recordings?</p>

<p>But then again this whole subject has already been beaten over and over again without any progression worth taking into account, just like with many other aspects:</p>

<ul>
<li>The 3 buildings could not have pancaked due to partial destruction and fires, they were demolished :: The counter argument for this is the NIST models which were changed over and over again until it suited the majority. (Trusses pulled outter structs, then they didn&#39;t pull and instead they pushed then they didn&#39;t do any of that and simply lost their links and the structure simply bulged)</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you see where I am going?</p>

<p>The only way this can be approached is by questioning the long lasting fires on the debris, they last for 100 days under heavy rain and the FD hosing. Steel and furniture alone cannot in any real world last for more than a few days, so what was causing that?</p>

<p>This is the one that the debunkers cannot answer, they can only say that &quot;it was a special fire, I want to see you putting that ammount of debris setting on fire and see how long it lasts&quot; without any evidence to back it up and even NIST cannot explain the situation with any evidence at all, in fact I am still waiting to see NIST explaining the duration of the debris fire.</p>

<p>So instead of asking you to debunk a subject that is as irrelevant as talking about reptilian people I am going to ask you to debunk this: Why did the debris fires last for 100 days under heavy rain and the FD hosing on all 3 towers?</p>

<p>If you reply with &quot;Special fire&quot; or &quot;it was just a huge ammount of things burning&quot; without any similar example to support this then I will not continue to waste my time in this thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate that you&#39;re engaging me on this, but I don&#39;t have specific knowledge of other aspects of the event. Personally I find the evidence and theories put forward by NIST and others to be compelling and to align with my intuition on such matters, but I&#39;m certainly not in any better position than NIST or others to argue those points. All I could do is quote others who feel they do have some insight, and that&#39;s pretty futile really - if you want to see those answers you&#39;d be just a capable of finding them as I am.</p>

<p>The reason I&#39;m focusing on the video stuff is that it&#39;s an area where I do have personal experience and expertise - I can offer my own experience and opinions on that. If you&#39;re satisfied that all the video is real (or real enough) then that&#39;s cool with me.</p>

<p>No, he didn&#39;t. When the TV interviewer asked why they were taking pictures, one of them they were doing it to &quot;document the event&quot;.  That <a href="http://www.911myths.com/index.php/Dancing_Israelis#Document_the_event">in no way implies that they had advance knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>Let me ask you, if they were spies, what were their photographs supposed to accomplish? They were <a href="http://i.imgur.com/BSMj93U.jpg">3 miles away</a> and they were northwest of the towers, so the photographs would be backlit by the sun. What could they possibly see from there that would be helpful to the Mossad? If they had advance knowledge, why wouldn&#39;t they be closer? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright.  This might take a while, because I have issue with every single video and still photograph record.   We can go one by one if you like.</p>

<p>The videos, stills and concerns are listed here:</p>

<p><a href="http://killtown.911review.org/2nd-hit.html">http://killtown.911review.org/2nd-hit.html</a></p>

<p>All 6 &#39;as it happened&#39; obscure the plane hitting the building, there are other anomalies general to all the videos that depict impact.</p>

<p>The plane object has different flight paths<br/>
The speeds and accuracy are unbelievable esp considering circumstances<br/>
The impacting object appears not to deform or conform to accepted collision physics.<br/>
The videos are edited, audio is suspect in several<br/>
Some stills of the plane are from videos..actually all of them are?<br/>
Videos and photos were seized and returned by government.
etc.. etc..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of fake videos put out to discredit anyone with legitimate concerns.  People focus too much on the buildings coming down and not as much on the EVENTS themselves.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t worry - I have no intention I trying to convince you the <em>official story</em> is the correct one - I&#39;m certainly not qualified for that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really only interested in people who believe that the videos we see of the events of 9/11 were manipulated fakes. That planes were added or backgrounds removed, that it was all greenscreen or whatever.</p>
