<p>The truth is that there is something going on in our solar system that they&#39;re trying to hide. It could be a normal part of some cycle or it could indicate something weird is going on. I will let you make your own mind up.</p>

These stories are all very new in terms of &#39;Universe Time&#39; and show rapid change happening right before our eyes.</p>

<p>In my inexpert opinion rapid changes in our Solar system like the above are indicative that we are not the cause of climate change as in reality earth is being affected far less than other planets. I believe there has been an energy shift from the sun to it&#39;s planets. Whilst the sun is appearing to be pretty damn lazy at the moment (even in solar maximum) all planets are acting up including us (extreme weather patterns, high/low temp records being broken, magnetic pole shift etc). This on top of the fact that both Earth and the Sun are undergoing magnetic reversals and with the recent bombardment of comets/asteroids etc makes me believe something is up. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.amsmeteors.org/members/fireball/browse_reports/?start_date=2013-1-1&amp;end_date=2013-9-29&amp;search_by_date_range=true&amp;f_month=1&amp;f_day=1&amp;f_year=2013&amp;t_month=9&amp;t_day=29&amp;t_year=2013&amp;state=&amp;event_id=&amp;event_year=2013">This is a link to the total reports of &#39;Fireballs&#39; been seen over America this year</a>
It&#39;s around 12000 currently. Last year is was around 6000. 2011 has just under 5000 and then 2010 has about 2500. To me this is unusual, especially as nearly one third of all sighting this year have been reported IN THE LAST 10 DAYS! 
Seriously check for you&#39;re selves, there have been more sightings in the last 10days of giant fireballs burning up in our atmosphere than in the entire of 2010 and nearly all of 2011. Something to do with Ison? something bigger than just Ison? I just want to know...</strong></p>

<p><strong>What the fuck is going on in our Solar system and why aren&#39;t people talking about it?</strong></p>

<p>Edit- Also with all this shit going on why the fuck are they shutting down Space Fence (orbital debris tracking)? I mean we&#39;re predicted to be flying through 2 comet debris trails in the months coming up and we&#39;re to do so blind?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody is saying we don&#39;t pollute earth and nobody is saying pollution doesnt affect earth. What I am saying is that everywhere we look in our solar system unusual weather/climates are being seen. Is it not silly to then say our climate is only changing because of us. </p>

<p>And yes a solar magnetic reversal is normal however the conditions of the sun as of the moment are not normal therefore an unexpected outcome could result.</p>

<p>You yourself said Ison is unpredictable, why then is Space Fence just being shut down before hand. It costs a measly 14mil to run (pocket change to the elite) per year, surely they could keep it going till the replacement is done, especially since we may need it just months after it gets shut down.</p>

<p>And by your logic in the last 10days there has been a massive spike in personal camera and social media use accounting for the high records of fireball sightings....
I can&#39;t get behind this, do you honestly think these factors can account for such a huge leap in reportings. Especially since the reports are in the form of an online form (not social media or picture orientated).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been watching meteors for years. Pre sep 2013 I&#39;d never seen a fireball. I&#39;ve seen 2 now and I don&#39;t even live in america where these reports come from.</p>

<p>Space Fence was only used to track things near Earth, so it wouldn&#39;t have anything to do with tracking comet ISON.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except there hasn&#39;t been a hiatus in warming for the last 15 years, 2012 was the hottest year (on average) ever recorded, and summer 2010 was the first time the polar sea ice completely melted. The pollutants we release (mainly CO2) are known to cause more solar energy to stay in our atmosphere, and our destruction of the natural environment reduces its ability to absorb and neutralize these chemicals. The reason Venus is hotter than mercury, despite being further away, is because it had a run away greenhouse effect happen because of its thick atmosphere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would be confident in saying that 95% of news-media personnel (writers, editors, et al) working on and headlining these articles, as well as the massive demographics consuming them don&#39;t actually have any sort of meaningful interest in, or basic understanding of appropriate geoscientific research. </p>

<p>What the public ultimately fails to understand are the important fundamental facts in a vast number of scientific disciplines (meteorology, helio-sciences, et friggin al). And yet, even with a basic understanding of such, one can seemingly acquire at the very least better assumptions, and a better sense of balance of the various &#39;truths&#39; of a certain situation.</p>

<p>It is a fact that the earth&#39;s climate is in a constant flux. The global climate ebbs and flows, freaks out, and freaks the fuck back in perpetually (as long as its here, anyway). On a geologic timescale this is obviously true, and simple ice cores can tell you that. </p>

<p>However, the greenhouse effect theory is a fact. We have perfect evidence for this on Venus (and its 460 (c) degree surface). Of course, the Morning Star (likely) didn&#39;t have a global industrial-capitalist freakout and burned oil until they were baked like pizzas. </p>

<p>There are certainly many ways we can see how this can happen on earth naturally. The most obvious (perhaps not to the public) is that as our ice caps melt/recede over large swaths of time, they release large amounts of trapped carbon dioxide (and to a lesser extent methane, which as a greenhouse gas is pretty bad too) thus (slowly) kicking off the greenhouse effect and causing the planet to endure a continuous warming trend (until ultimately recovering and eventually entering an ice age, perhaps). </p>

<p>This is the favourite argument for what are often referred to as &#39;global warming deniers&#39;, or &#39;complete-fucknuts&#39;.  It is actually completely valid. However, the issue here is not the accuracy of the arguments of one &#39;side&#39;, rather their impressively vehement denial of other existing, and completely relevant facts. </p>

<p>Like this one, for instance: It is a fact that approximately 95% (there&#39;s that number again!) of current emissions of carbon dioxide on this planet are <strong>anthropogenic</strong> in nature. That means (like Soylent Green) <em>it&#39;s people.</em> Think of mother earth as the Tortoise and Global Industrial Boot-Stomp as the Hare. There is absolutely no doubt that barring the existence of <strong>anthropogenic</strong> (CAN I HAVE MY BILLION DOLLARS NOW?) greenhouse gas emissions, there is much evidence to suggest that from our current climactic state (even pre-industrial age) a global warming (as it were) trend would be occurring. </p>

<p>Conversely, and completely related might i add, there is much (more even) evidence to suggest that our influence, and our desperate lust for burning fossil fuels (or our ironic lust to fly around in planes to speak ill of them) is significantly increasing the rate (95%) at which the greenhouse gas effect reaches it&#39;s tipping point and fires upwards on a graph through Al Gore&#39;s robot balls while he stands on a cherry-picker looking like an idiot.</p>

<p>Further still, there is the very real possibility that our current levels have reached a point of no return and as such, the greenhouse gas effect has started and eventually will increase exponentially, until we&#39;re all fighting wars to gain entry into the weird doomsday bunker under Denver International Airport (Hint: <em>THEY</em> win).</p>

<p>So what have we learned then? First of all, the main point that jumps out here is that 95% of greenhouse gas emissions are made by humans (true). So i suppose i completely agree with the article that i didn&#39;t read&#39;s headline (but i&#39;m sure this fact is cited, its in the headline for christ&#39;s sake). However, we&#39;ve also learned that the people who think this is some sort of conspiratorial assault on the sensibilities of a public becoming increasingly aware of an all-encompassing tyrannical beatdown has an insanely selective ability or willingness to understand and cite scientific data, while that same population (i&#39;m gonna go ahead and guess 5%) completely ignores others to further their agendas. </p>

<p>Of course, both &#39;sides&#39; are guilty of doing that very thing constantly. On many topics. Actually, all topics. It is a matter that is philosophic in nature, and doesn&#39;t only pertain to certain paradigms of duality. In all things discussed amongst skeptics, conspiracy theorists and drugged-up intellectuals there is a very high resolution gradient of verifiable positions, but the facts are solid blocks of black and white. Just because certain groups will use facts to further their exploitative agendas does not mean that these facts don&#39;t exist. It is the way they are often presented that is the issue.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the FACT that ~95% of American media is owned by 6 corporations, as well as the facts that these corporations are guilty of crimes against both law, and basic morality. These corporations are also large perpetrators in extreme greenhouse gas emissions. Are these evil, ever-reaching, shadowy controllers using this media to give you your opinions, keep you sedated, and misdirect your attention on petty squabbles that are meaningless to the situation? Absolutely. Is it important that &#39;facts&#39; are questioned, debunked, investigated, cited, studied, and researched when they are often (mostly) presented in questionable fashions? Of course, but we must break free of the impulse to dismiss things that we associate with an agenda of the powers that be. </p>

<p>We shouldn&#39;t associate the &#39;facts&#39; with anything, but the path to better understanding. The reason this isn&#39;t the case, has been fabricated and ingrained in you by the very people (those 6 corporations) and their very methods (their media), because it is in their best interest when they are rounding you up in FEMA camps to gas you all in their corporo-statist, luciferian-eugenicist crusade of the world. Novus ordo seclorum.</p>

<p>EDIT: My main problem with climate science is that what they are doing is not science. Science is never settled. There is a preponderance of evidence on one side or the other but the debate is never closed as new facts can always emerge. This seems to be the case now in climate science. </p>
