        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So first off, let me say that I&#39;m new to reddit but have been interested in conspiracies since before the prevalence of the internet.  Throughout the years I have come across much to suggest that there is indeed a few select people running the show.  But regardless of how much I dig, I have never truly pinpointed the actual people pulling the strings. One can narrow it down to a few organizations but beyond that it becomes too much smoke and too many mirrors.</p>

<p>So my question to this collection of conspiracy enthusiasts is: Who specifically is running the show and what evidence might we collectively gather to support these claims?</p>

<p>As long as these individuals remain in shadow, we cannot hope to stop/reveal what most of us believe they are doing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right now I would just like to get the info out in the public knowledge.  I think TPTB would have less influence and control if we could peg down exactly who they are.  And as to the diversity, that is determined by simple observation. If TPTB were truly centralized in one arena (eg banking or government etc) then they would be  a lot easier to pin down.  Also the scale at which all of this is being done requires wide spread influence of multiple sectors of business and government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you plan on getting this information out to the public? When, and if you do, what makes you think people will believe a conspiracy in the scale you&#39;re going after? This is a millennial conspiracy we&#39;re dealing with, not who took down a couple of buildings or shot some president in the head.</p>

<p>And yes, it is centralized. By bankers and finance. Since everyone has a price, and they control the cash flow, the possibilities become endless. Take the Vatican, please. Kidding. They have their own bank because they recognize the power it has, otherwise why not use any other globalized bank to hold on to their money? Find out who sits at the global throne of banking and finance and you have your answer. However, you won&#39;t <em>ever</em> find out just who that is/they are. The most we can do right now is unmask the puppets (Presidents, Dictators, Diplomats) until TPTB run out and the curtains fall.</p>

<p>You question: &quot;Who runs the show?&quot; will never be answered in this lifetime, much less will you find evidence to back it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what makes any conspiracy not only daunting but also depressing.  We can unmask puppets all we want but that doesn&#39;t effect much.  So if we can never unmask/identify those pulling the strings, then what is the point of bringing any of this up or chasing which ever puppet they bring into view? If unmasking these people and/or revealing their puppets is almost fruitless, then what can and should we do to combat all of this?</p>

<p>How to disseminate such info is obvious and whether people believe it or not is out of my control. But I look at it like this: How does one ruin a magic show or other performance based on illusion? You reveal to the audience that which is hidden. That is my intent here.  Can we as a group follow the wires and look behind the mirrors? Or should we just accept that we are stuck in a theater watching a show that many here don&#39;t like and are highly critical of?  If we ruin the performance do we get to leave?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Rothschild family have managed to amass a pretty massive fortune, but there are other players which rival their fortune if not surpass it whom they work with or work for. I&#39;ll put it like this, they had the right ideas to get rich, but they just weren&#39;t the first to do it. It&#39;s very speculative when it comes to pinpointing the head of all it. </p>

<p>Some say the Jesuit order and the Knights of Malta, some say European Black Nobility, some say Rothschild, some say the ancient families of Rome, some say Prussian nobility, some say a family that starts with an H (Forgot the name), some say the Brotherhood of the Serpent, and some say of people even before then and link it to that whole Atlantean wormhole.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never believed in the whole Rothschilds being the sole puppet masters due to they only came around in the 16th Century. Not only that, but those with true power will never be seen. Granted, the only time you truly see the Rothschilds backing something is when you see them pop up in articles with Alcoa, merging banks, or helping fund the Council on Foreign Relations. Other than that, they&#39;re pretty ghost. </p>

<p>However, they have a reputation and that reputation is known, and if you&#39;re truly running something that you don&#39;t want people finding out about - you can&#39;t be well known. So, who&#39;s the man behind the man behind the man behind the man in the mirror? That&#39;s the question, and personally - my money&#39;s not on Rothschild. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the oldest established order that there is out there? Find that out, and that&#39;s where the money is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is actually where I stall is at names. I can say the Council on Foreign Relations, the IMF, the Federal Reserve, GE, Monsanto, the DOD (this one is especially frustrating since those with the highest security clearances are far removed from the spotlight) and many others. I can track money only about that far but I am hesitant to lay blame at the feet of these institutions because not all the people within them may not be entirely or consciously complicit.</p>

<p>Now, I have no wealth or resources (or time) to invest in tracking down and revealing these individuals. So, upon discovering reddit, I thought that this might be a good venue to crowd source what we all know and see how much it correlates.  I can see now this was a mistake, not because of a lack of knowledge by users or a fear of reprisal by those listening, but because I&#39;ll probably spend more time defending myself to those who are just trolling or on their own personal witch hunts than actually engaging in constructive debate/conversation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really the point of this thread.  I figured with so many sharing info that we might come to some consensus on who is actually pulling the strings. Just identifying these individuals and letting more people know would be a much more effective step than just pointing out what the puppet theater is doing.  </p>

<p>How many people have ever done that beyond laying blame to a single group like bankers, or Big Oil, or Big Pharma, or (the old fall-back) the jews?  Such claims never really do anything but cause arguments.  With such a space as Reddit, my hope was that we could get past that, recognize that all of it is not confined to any one group/ethnicity/religion/ethos and actually pinpoint the jackwagons that seem to running the show. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bildeberg Meeting attendance lists are probably the closest I have ever come to putting names to the power hierarchy. But who attends is a little different every year and I&#39;ve only ever seen one list (2004). It would be interesting if I could get multiple attendance lists and see who is a regular and who isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Him stating the following which I have pulled from the thread linked above proves the fact he is attempting to spread disinformation.</p>

<p>&quot;Obama is a US citizen.
9/11 didnt use controlled substances. That makes no sense.
There are no plans to poison your water or flu shots or food etc.
GMOs are actually good for you. really. do the fucking research.
boston bombers acted on their own volition. Autism and sociopathy
The US government DHS is not preparing to kill civilians.
Mind Control is real, but not the way you think. Please see MKULTRA (the only real mind control results).
JFK was killed by the mob with help from DoD brass
Chemtrails don&#39;t make sense.
Monsanto isn&#39;t evil like Umbrella Corp, but they do suck as a corporation.&quot;</p>

<p>When if you actually research all of that, you&#39;ll find COMPLETELY different results as to what he&#39;s saying and what&#39;s the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said disinformation first and foremost, since this must be your alternate account dick. Don&#39;t get it twisted.</p>

<p>A.) The mafia were only involved in the Castro aspect of the whole J.F.K. coup. Nothing more.</p>

<p>B.) The C.I.A. were the ones who arranged Kennedy&#39;s assassination. Oswald was a patsy for them, and the C.I.A. wouldn&#39;t outsource for J.F.K. considering those who would be said to be involved (American Mafia) either ended up dead or in jail within a decade later and could use that card against the U.S. Government if they ever needed a get out of jail pass.</p>

<p>C.) Explain building WTC 7. Bet you can&#39;t without the use of thermite.</p>

<p>D.) GMO&#39;s aren&#39;t good for you. That&#39;s like saying the F.D.A. is genuinely interested in maintaining the health of the American public.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.responsibletechnology.org/10-Reasons-to-Avoid-GMOs">http://www.responsibletechnology.org/10-Reasons-to-Avoid-GMOs</a></p>

<p>E.) Obama is not a U.S. citizen, he represents the Saudi faction hence why a Saudi prince paid for his education. Apparently, you don&#39;t understand deep politics.</p>

<p>F.) The C.I.A. had contact with the Boston Bombers before their little incident. If that doesn&#39;t set off red flags, I don&#39;t know what does.</p>

<p>G.) Explain the D.H.S. buying so many ammunition rounds, and the use for F.E.M.A.</p>

<p>H.) Chemtrails have been proven. Did you not see what they did to St. Louis?</p>

<p>I.) Mind control is very, very, very real outside of MK Ultra. I also take it you never researched how the C.I.A. helped start and control the hippie movement via Laurel Canyon.</p>

<p>J.) Monsanto is very evil. If they aren&#39;t, explain to me why they&#39;re so interested in killing bees.</p>

<p>EDIT: Forgot to mention, fluoride in the water. That&#39;s all I need to say about them and the whole food poisoning thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty sure it was the C.I.A. and I wouldn&#39;t say that the F.B.I. only runs terrorist bombings on U.S. Soil considering there&#39;s evidence linking both of them to the Oklahoma City bombings.
