It is understandable someone with a child in the car would try and escape when the officers are only moments away from opening fire. Anyway...which brave souls open fire on a mother and child. All in the protection of what? The Australian news reports are saying the woman had psychological problems....who doesn&#39;t? There is so much blood on the US government&#39;s hands, I feel sorry for the American people. I hope you vote in Jesse Ventura for President. My opinion from Australia. </p>

Did you believe Romney was going to win the election too?
It just doesn&#39;t make sense.  Tv viewership and Cable News viewership are much higher than radio listenership, let alone one channel on a premium subscription provider like Sirius.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually that driver executed basic evasive maneuvers in a fashion that suggested she knew she was coming under fire. The roundabout trick is a tactical maneuver for combative driving.</p>

<p>The media is reporting this woman as a postal worker. That&#39;s a near mint condition G37 which is well out of the range of most government salaries available from the post office. That in itself is atypical but not necessarily invalidating.</p>

<p>What should have immediately occurred to most federal employees is that, when facing other federal employees who are responding to a trained threat, there are procedures. It would be obvious that weapons would be drawn if she was perceived as a potential threat in the area.</p>

<p>There are several peculiar things about this incident though. I&#39;m going to listen them:</p>

<p>1) A man in a black shirt and beige shorts with a gun is responding to the scene from an unmarked vehicle. It&#39;s white and visible on the left side of the frame at 0:27. There is another man wearing shorts with a gun in a white shirt, likely his partner.</p>

<p>2) The suspect doesn&#39;t attempt to flee until the two plain clothes officers are in view.</p>

<p>3) The man in the white shirt is the one firing the shots. No one else appears to be firing their weapons.</p>

<p>4) There is another officer approaching the scene after shots are fired from the direction of the camera man. He is walking and does not have his weapon drawn. Visible at 0:34 - 0:36 on the left side of the frame.</p>

<p>5) The roundabout maneuver made was not in response to a direct blockade ahead of the G37. If there were a blockade then a police vehicle could not be approaching and bypassed from that direction at 00:58-01:00.</p>

<p>6) There is a tripod camera set up in the direction of the fleeing vehicle&#39;s path by tourists laying on the lawn visible at 01:07. </p>

<p>7) At 00:56 we see that virtually none of the observers on the grass are interested enough to stand up, four aren&#39;t interested in watching the chase and casually observe the original stop point instead. They&#39;re on the left side of the frame.</p>

<p>8) We hear sirens are 00:01 but the protestor wearing sunglasses with an unreadable sign does not react until 00:13 when the camera man audibly says something.</p>

<p>9) There&#39;s a front-left impact mark on the vehicle about the tire well behind the front left headlight visible at 00:26. The indentation appears to have come from an object that was taller than the vehicle, possibly the bumper of an SUV. This is evident because the shape of the impact had a minimum height that was taller than the wheel well of a G37 by about 2-3 inches. The poles in front of the vehicle are not shaped in a manner that would permit this form of indentation. Furthermore, there are no visible scrapes on the paint which suggests this was a single direction kinetic impact, rather than a grazing kinetic impact.</p>

<p>9) The only couple reacting to shots fired is visible at 00:42 and actively preparing to seek cover from stray bullets. All observers appear unengaged.</p>

<p>10) The is another photographer near the tripod taking shots with a high resolution visible at 01:09.</p>

<p>11) There is a stretch hummer parked on the side of the road at 01:04.</p>

<p>12) At 00:49 there is another unmarked blue vehicle of the same make and model as the white vehicle the plainsclothes officers emerged from responding to the scene on the adjacent road with an officer running his emergency lights directly behind him. The two roads do not connect at any point between in that direction. They do have a common junction prior to that though and it appears the pair were enroute to block incoming traffic to the area.</p>

<p>Goodluck.</p>

<p>Financing bro, you can get one for like 3-500 a month, I had a $27,000 truck financed when I was 20 and my payments were $500 but it was my first car on my own. I&#39;m sure she could of got a really good monthly payment on one, or maybe she got a settlement or someone left money for her.. not sure where I&#39;m going with this, bored.</p>

<p>That was the first report on her identity I heard from Washington Post, one of the first reporting on the scene.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m from a big city. Sirens, yes. Gunshots, nope. You always given a shit about where the gunshots are coming from and you want to know why and who. Because you don&#39;t know if some psychopath has a gun and decided today&#39;s the day. Maybe the cops want to shoot something in your direction because they hate it. Whatever the case may be one thing is for certain; people suck at aiming and bullets ricochet. So when shots are fired, where, why and how do I get out of the potential path are all really important questions.</p>

<p>The alternative is &quot;duck and make myself as small as possible&quot;. Which one of the people on scene does at around 01:02.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They will say that she had a history of mental problems, and tried to access &#39;sensitive&#39; areas of the capitol. They will say that she was suicidal and will &quot;find&quot; online posts from her saying how angry she was at the government and that she intended to &#39;do something about it&#39;. Some may imply that this was suicide by cop, and she intended for her child to die along with her. </p>

<p>You can bet they will make it look like she was an unhinged individual that needed to be taken down because of her murderous intent (her car as the weapon, of course). </p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping that in the coming days, phone conversations, etc. between her and friends/family will come to light which might explain what happened but unfortunately, if it is simply a case of a panicked woman trying to avoid being killed, we will never hear that as the &#39;official&#39; story.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> - yep, just saw a story blaming it on post-natal depression. Looks like that may be the official story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well thank you for calling my distinction stupid, that&#39;s eloquent.  And I will try to civilly address the ignorance of your statement without insult.</p>

<p>I think you are making a rather broad and unsupported declaration about law enforcement.  There have been a number of reported cases of police behaving less than proper, true. And if you visit this sub often, it would seem that your statement is actually true.  But to say that they are worse than gangs is a bit of a stretch and I&#39;m not sure you really grasp what it&#39;s like to be a police officer.  You are allowing a small percentage of a group that is bad to bias your opinion. And who is reporting on the good guy cops? You won&#39;t find it on this sub.  Maybe if there was more of that, statistically the group of bad ones would be more representative of their actual numbers.</p>

<p>you must have gotten your logical facilities from the same gene pool as obama. While there are cronies on every level in every agency/department, there are good people there as well. Your umbrella statement that all cops are bad is exactly the same as the statement that all blacks are gangbangers and all muslims are terrorists and all christians are going to heaven. People, like you, who fail to disconnect with their own bias when labelling a population of any group of people, represent the same group of people who are destroying this country. I send you my sympathies, because you must have had tramatic experiences with the police in order to actually believe what you said.</p>

<p>FYI, my brother is a state trooper. He is one of the most level headed and fair-minded  people i know. His heart is honest, and his loyalty is to the civilians of this country. I have no doubt that he would sacrifice his own life to save another person, even one like yourself who somehow believes he is the rotten one. </p>

<p>My suggestion to you, is to place the blame where it belongs. and it belongs to the individuals who are corrupt, not on the shoulders of the good guys.</p>

And police cars are surrounding it and it is still trying to escape. Would you think it was hostile? If you do. That means guns drawn are warranted. Actually shooting still wouldn&#39;t be warranted until she tries to run you over. Which she did to a few officers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all bullshit.. Took a wrong turn? Lmao she knew what she was doing .. And she didn&#39;t get shot at until after she backed into a police car with fucking 10 cops around her telling her to get outta the vehicle ... She deserved what she got and you all can give me as many downvotes as you want .. She was the one running a barricade in front of the capital while it&#39;s already on lockdown .. She could of stopped then and got out of the car .. How many times have you watched cops and seen them kill a driver for using their vehicle as a weapon .. Just move on and remind yourself their are dumbass ppl out their just like this lady .. If I just ran through a barricade and had ten cops yelling at me to get outta the car i would, not try to run over ten of them </p>

<p>No it is not. </p>

<p>It is not sensible to engage in a high speed chase with the police while you have a toddler in your car.</p>

<p>If she had honestly made a mistake one would expect the reasonable and sensible thing to do would be to raise ones hands, let officers open the door and remove you form the car. Not speed away from armed police just after you have tried to illegally enter one of the most secure buildings in the world.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can see much of what happens, but your statement that it&#39;s 100% obvious that the police are completely in the right is an exaggeration. It&#39;s very hard to judge the woman&#39;s intentions just from this video.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell from the video for example, there&#39;s no major obvious damage from the front of the car that indicates that she was trying to force her way through the barrier. The police&#39;s narrative was that she was trying to ram through the barrier. That part of the story seems to be embellished a bit.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s enough info to make a reasonable judgement on this yet. Maybe the cops are in the right and maybe they&#39;re not, but I think your 100% statement is a bit much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That she made an unwise decision doesn&#39;t imply that the police are entirely in the right either.</p>

<p>That area of DC has to have a lot of security cameras. I don&#39;t see how anybody could give a conclusive judgement on this incident without seeing more evidence of what happened just before and throughout this incident. There are multiple interpretations that fit the facts as we know them so far.</p>

<p>However, at least one part of the police&#39;s narrative (that she was trying to ram through the gate) is demonstrable hyperbole as there is no obvious impact damage. </p>

<p>There are lots of theories, but I just don&#39;t think anybody could reasonably make a solid claim here yet with the video that has been released. Maybe there are other videos yet to come out that bolster the police&#39;s case, and maybe not. I think anybody who is rushing to defend the police as doing their jobs 100% perfectly is operating prematurely on inconclusive information.</p>

<p>Her actions are consistent with lost and confused and then fleeing.  She was not aiming her car as a weapon as much as she was fleeing with reckless disregard for the officers.  If she had a death wish why didn&#39;t she jump out and charge the WH or do something similar?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the insult. The officers were waving their guns around with no regard for the child in the car that they could clearly see.

<p>I never said it was a conspiracy. Just because I replied to a post in r/conspiracy doesn&#39;t mean I automatically believe this is a full blown, cover up to come conspiracy.

<p>Maybe she was mentally ill. Maybe she was just scared for her and her child&#39;s life and went into panic mode and took off, NOT injuring anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;waving their guns around with no regard for the child in the car that they could clearly see.&quot; How the hell can you know that? In a flurry of activity there is no way that is for certain.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, they quickly hopped out of the way, guess cars can&#39;t excel human speed and reaction capabilities.&quot; ... So you&#39;re saying that a human cannot possibly jump out of the way of a moving vehicle because cars excel human speed and reaction capabilities? Utter nonsense.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe she was just scarred for her and her child&#39;s life and went into panic mode and took off, NOT injuring anyone.&quot; The only reason she didn&#39;t injure anyone was good reflexes and blind luck. </p>

<p>How can you honestly watch that video and come to a different conclusion?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t justify using a car as a weapon because some officers pulled a gun on you and issued you orders regardless whether you have a child in the car or not. Having a kid doesn&#39;t give you a run down anyone when you&#39;re afraid license.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Thought I was clear on this one, guess not, I&#39;ll elaborate. If the woman had intended to injure or more specifically run over one of the LEO&#39;s, she would have, all it took was a bit more of the pedal on the right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only reason she didn&#39;t injure anyone was good reflexes and blind luck. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the ONLY reason possible? Really? Why then, pray tell, did she not run them over when she turned around? Why didn&#39;t she ram right through the vehicle that blocked her on her first attempt to leave that area?</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t mean to say that having a child in the car gives you a &quot;run down anyone when you&#39;re afraid license&quot;, my arthritis must be acting up. Must&#39;ve made my fingers slip when I said &quot;went into panic mode and took off&quot; /s. But of course it doesn&#39;t give you that &quot;license&quot;, I&#39;m not pretending or insinuating that it does. </p>

<p>She didn&#39;t use the car as a weapon. She used it as an escape vehicle in a situation where her and her child&#39;s life was in danger.</p>

<p>The most obvious and set in stone piece of information we can all take from this whole situation is simply this: We&#39;ll never hear her side of the story anyways.</p>

<p>= Speculation /  MSM Lines that you are repeating without any further evidence. They also said that the completely totaled Police Cruiser was a direct cause of this woman too, but turns out the cop didn&#39;t see a barricade and rammed right over/through it, causing the damage all by himself. <a href="http://youtu.be/Ao3617loZ0k">Seen here</a></p>

<p>She may have made a bad move and endangered her and her child&#39;s life by driving away at that point, I won&#39;t argue that it wasn&#39;t STUPID but to say someone is justified in being shot for doing so is ludicracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They started shooting after she started driving aggressively.</p>

<p>I like how you highlighted the <strong>avoiding</strong> part but neglected to bold the <strong>Officers having to jump out of the way</strong> part which when then put in proper context you see how she <strong>avoided</strong> hitting them.</p>

<p>I have seen that video and will give you that, I&#39;m just going on what evidence we have at the moment.</p>

<p>I will repeat the crux of my argument. </p>

<p>A person who acts recklessly with a car is just as dangerous as a person acting recklessly with a gun. If you then proceed to ignore police orders, nearly hit them with your car while fleeing or trying to hit them intentionally (either one) the police are well within their rights to use force to defend themselves and the public.</p>

<p>She instigated the force when she refused to leave the vehicle and took off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Driving aggressively is not synonymous with driving recklessly, by law at least. </p>

<p>Yes yes yes, how many times must I tell you I agree that she was fleeing, she <strong>DID drive at and or towards officers whom had surrounded her vehicle</strong> </p>

<p>I also would like to point out, they immediately surround her car with people instead of the rest of their cruisers. I feel like if that happened, she never would have been able to leave that spot and this whole ordeal never would have escalated to someone&#39;s life being lost. This is of course nothing more than opinion.</p>

<p>A human being scared for their life and the life of their child is more than enough reason to do uncharacteristic and admittedly stupid things. Again, not saying this <em>justifies</em> doing the things she did, it still doesn&#39;t justify shooting her dead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t see gun waving, I saw officers assessing a threat and letting the suspect know that their best option is to get out of the car, now.

<p>I abhor actual incidents of police brutality, where an officer uses their power to physically or otherwise harm a citizen who is innocent of wrongdoing.  I also abhor when every time police have to do their job, people immediately cry brutality.  YOU go out there and deal with the threats that exist in the world today and let&#39;s see how good your decision making skills are when faced with reducing the threat to yourself and the other citizens you&#39;ve sworn to protect.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I agree with you. Sometimes they get it wrong, sometimes they save lives.</p>

<p>My opinion is that they got it wrong this time.</p>

<p>To respond to your statement though, &quot;not the actions of someone who is stable and not a threat to others (including her own child). &quot; is speculation. </p>

<p>Do you have a child? If you do, have you ever been in a situation where that child had a gun pointed in their general direction and YOU had to react within seconds to avoid you or your child being killed, even by accident? <strong>I think it&#39;s more than fair to say that you can give this woman the same benefit of the doubt that you&#39;re giving these police officers that are <em>specifically trained</em> to make decisions/reactions within seconds</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do have a child and I know what a REAL threat to my child is. There is no benefit of the doubt for this woman in particular though.  She was an educated woman, who had a sister who was a staff sergeant with NYPD.  She was more than aware of proper protocol when being approached by officers.  This was mental illness, and as long as she is in a two ton, motorized weapon, SHE is the threat and given her evasive action, there was no opportunity for officers to try and reason with her. She was a threat to herself and everyone in the vicinity including her child. No one knows why she made the trip from CT to Washington with a one year old, accounts are she really had no reason to be there, so as facts emerge, it is very questionable what her motives were.  But ya, the police who put themselves in harms way to protect everyone else, they&#39;re the bad guys for sure and should be totally chastised by the public for doing their job.  </p>

<p>If you are looking for an ACTUAL example of police unnecessarily using their weapons, here is a great one:  <a href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iy2zsuRyjaQ&amp;amp;desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Diy2zsuRyjaQ">http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iy2zsuRyjaQ&amp;amp;desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Diy2zsuRyjaQ</a></p>

<p>Probably also mental health, but he was alone on that streetcar when he was shot 9 times and then tazed. At the time he was shot he was only a threat to himself, (not like the woman who was in a vehicle) police didn&#39;t waste time on talking to him or using other non-lethal means of diffusing the situation, the officer just unloaded his clip.</p>

<p>The officer has been charged, and this is a great article on how other officers didn&#39;t automatically jump to his defence, they knew it was wrong but the challenge now is to prove that the officer intended to kill the young man or he reasonably felt that he was in danger.  <a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/m/wp/full-comment/blog.html?b=fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/08/20/matt-gurney-even-the-cops-cant-defend-the-shooting-death-of-sammy-yatim">http://www.nationalpost.com/m/wp/full-comment/blog.html?b=fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2013/08/20/matt-gurney-even-the-cops-cant-defend-the-shooting-death-of-sammy-yatim</a></p>

<p>I urge you to watch that video of the woman again, a few times, I did.  And then forget about the police narrative, and try to objectively see the situation without applying your own narrative.</p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t happen without a reason. When the cops do a good job, very little is said. That&#39;s not fair to them, but these types of situations are not the rule, they are the exception. So to write these off as &#39;sometimes they make mistakes&#39; isn&#39;t good enough; sometimes the police DO participate in brutality and lethal force when it&#39;s not necessary... and nothing happens. This is what sparks the outrage. We need to start holding police officers accountable for situations like this so there is an impetus for change. While there may have been some small danger to the police at one point in the altercation, by the time they chose to kill her I don&#39;t think the same could be said. </p>

<p>What you are more or less arguing is that a Hit and Run constitutes the death penalty... would you agree with that statement? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all about intent and proving that intent.  In the video she was already being pursued by police for having tried to ram a security gate, the video starts when she was trying to evade them and was barricaded by cruisers.  The video shows her intent to evade, and her willingness to harm anyone who might be stupid enough to get in her way.  There is really no reason to be trying to evade police, in the middle of the day, with a one year old in the car, in front if the white house. I find the mama bear protecting her cub theory in response to the officers guns highly implausible because she would have created the threat to the public to have police chasing her in the first place.   If it was a simple traffic violation, why would you flee?  As a mother protecting my kid, I know that is a way more dangerous option.</p>

I agree fear does rule the day and although there are some shady law enforcement out there it must also be a terrifying job right now with the climate of the world.  Bombs going off at marathons, shootings at schools, shootings not far from the white house just a few weeks ago.  Her actions would have been seen as a huge threat and there are pieces of the story missing. What is the bone of contention is people justifying her actions in the video.

<p>All of those incidents are shady and the exception to the rule. All had unanswered questions and misaligned facts. You are right in that we don&#39;t know how great or little a threat she was, but she was unarmed and I really don&#39;t think she had to die. We could have found out what was going on, but she is dead. We&#39;ll never know; we&#39;ll be told by those who now have something to hide if she wasn&#39;t exactly who they thought she was. That&#39;s whats frustrating...</p>

<p>And frankly, &#39;scared&#39; police officers is not an excuse. If I was a police officer that was scared to come to work each day, I probably shouldn&#39;t be a police officer. We had the same thing here in Canada; some dude from Poland got caught in the airport and didn&#39;t know what was going on and he ended up very frustrated and threw a chair and computer monitor at some officers trying to calm him down. They ended up tazing him multiple times and he died. Those officers are now being charged but they are also being protected. Just because you are an authority does not give you carte blanche to make whatever mistake you want because you were &#39;scared&#39;. Scared police officers make things more dangerous for everybody, and not everyone who&#39;s a cop should be. That&#39;s how I feel.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not justifying them, but I am questioning what would make her act this way. I don&#39;t see malicious intent towards the police tho... I see somebody not listening to authority. I don&#39;t feel that failure to comply should enable the use of deadly force. She was unarmed and she didn&#39;t try to kill anybody (in fact, one of the police officers injuries were due to themselves crashing into a barrier... the other was knocked out by an airbag deployment). If we had a dead or paralyzed officer here, i&#39;d maybe understand, but we don&#39;t. That&#39;s the problem. She died for freaking out and panicking. I don&#39;t see how people can claim she was trying to kill police officers or &#39;smash into the white house&#39; from the same video you say is so conclusive. She was trying to get away, but we don&#39;t know why. That was the only crime there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that police waited as long as they did to open fire is almost surprising. The cops and civilians were obviously in danger from her blatant aggressive driving (as seen when the cops are forced to jump out of the way multiple times). Her disregard to stand down when multiple policemen are aiming right at her only shows she knows she&#39;s in the wrong, sure, guns are being pointed at her, but they are policemen in the capital of our nation, not some gang trying to jack your car. She then drove in that circle to obviously buy a little time and scope out her options easier. </p>

<p>This thread is lucky she didn&#39;t injure someone because you&#39;d have no argument. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They shot up two of their own pretty good, and this proves that the police gunfire was by far the more dangerous dimension of what went down that day.  </p>

<p>If just one of those cops had stayed in his vehicle to use it to block her from driving away, instead of jumping out with his gun to point it at her, then it would have likely all ended right there, but not one single cop had the presence of mind to think of this!</p>

<p>The cop car that was so totally destroyed was due to the cop driving it going straight into a barricade all by himself - he obviously didn&#39;t even see it in time to avoid it.</p>

<p>Your whole post is a what if - <em>what if she had injured somebody?</em> - and, well, are you a cop?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think anyone thinks killing the woman was a good idea.  From what information is out there, it looks like a situation that escalated quickly and badly, and probably could have been prevented.  It&#39;s tragic.  Just like with plane crashes, it&#39;s usually a sequence of mistakes that lead to catastrophe, not an isolated slip-up.</p>

<p>Things are touchy around the White House and the Capitol in general.  If you&#39;ve ever driven around there, you&#39;ll know what I mean.  I got lost in DC in a U-Haul truck, and I had a Crown Vic tailing me as soon as I was within a few blocks of the White House.  And that was in the &#39;90s...</p>

<p>So you&#39;ve got a lady who&#39;s driving in that area, and maybe she fucks up and hits a fence.  No big deal.  Cops tail her and she takes off.  Okay, now everyone&#39;s got a little adrenaline going.  Then we see what happens in the video.  Cops with guns out brings the adrenaline higher.  Driver doing a 3-point into a cop car pushes it even higher again.  And on and on until tragedy occurs.  It&#39;s a fucked situation that <em>everyone</em> involved pushed over the edge.</p>

<p>No one likes to see a kid lose his mother, but it <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&#39;s Defcon 1 freakout any better than what&#39;s happening on the 24 hour news networks?  I know that reacting in the total opposite way to something you oppose <em>feels</em> good, but does it warrant creating a fiction around it (Connecticut woman taking her 18-month-old to school in DC?) <em>just</em> to be contrary?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how making up a story about this woman taking her kid to school and getting lost is helpful.  <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> seems to be a counter-balance by fetishizing doom and violence in a <em>different</em> way from the mainstream media.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s scary how the news reporter is trying to justify it... By saying that the shots were fired after the car impacted the police cruiser, causing the airbags to deploy injuring the officer... So the airbags go off, it&#39;s ok to shoot the person that hit you? Man that makes road rage look weak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I don&#39;t get... when did a hit and run demand the death penalty in return? Especially when the person is driving away from you when you actually kill them?</p>

<p>Part of me wonders if this was one of those situations where she was in some sort of shadowy tight spot where she didn&#39;t trust the police for whatever reason... Guess we&#39;ll never know for sure </p>

<p>edit: saw this quote in the NY times story</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What occurred next was not clear. Ms. Carey managed to get out of the car, and was shot by several officers. According to a law enforcement official, she was not armed, and it was not known whether she presented an immediate danger.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So she was more or less executed? Am I missing something here? Also, a better video is going around that shows at least one of the police crashes/injuries was caused by the police car itself crashing into a barrier on its own accord. All I can say is poor kid...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m brown. I&#39;m asian. I&#39;ve been pulled over by the cops before in America. I&#39;ve had a cop drive up around me and some friends and we had out BB-guns, fireworks and beer out. I kept my cool. I knew my rights. I asked if we were free to go. I got lucky without having a hot-head cop.</p>

<p>I know they go insane sometimes. I&#39;ve taken video of them illegally searching black people across thee street from where I lived in Ohio.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying, judging from this video, this girl was the problem in the situation. Maybe something happened before the part we saw which led her to believe the cops weren&#39;t going to be reasonable. But there&#39;s no evidence of that. From what we see, every decision she made was dangerous, insane and endangered her life, the cops life and the life of her child. </p>

They asked her if she had an appointment with the White House and she said No but that Obama needs to finally see her child. (The woman was claiming that the infant with her was, in fact, Obama&#39;s kid).  She then blew past the checkpoint and the pursuit began.  I don&#39;t know how legitimate this is but I believe this is why the media was saying she was mentally unstable right away before they could even give any information about the woman (as they knew nothing about her yet).</p>

When she was driving towards the cops I could see that being a justified shooting as her car was a deadly weapon but once her car is out of the picture they could have made a normal arrest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as how the shooting went down there were enough witnesses/cameras around that we do know she wrecked her car and got out before the police shot her.  The first time they opened fire when they had her blocked between the barricade and a police car and she rammed the car and then drove thru the officers would have been a righteous shooting.  The fatal shooting was a bit sketchy.  After 9-11 the laws (courtesy of the patriot act) for what constitutes a &quot;legal police shooting&quot; changed in areas within close proximity to the president though so I suppose technically so long as the president is within a certain distance they can pretty much pick off anyone they believe to be a threat, armed or not.  Legal and right are two different things though in cases like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ridiculous. She ran from the cops hitting 80 mph in a crowded downtown area, AFTER trying to crash the barricade at the White House. Maybe it was an accident, sure. But running from the police is fucking stupid, especially after you just posed a threat to the safety of the of the President AND hit a cop with your car. He death is the result of her own shitty decisions. That&#39;s a fact. That she &quot;took a wrong turn&quot; is pure speculation, and capitol police don&#39;t take kindly to you hit and running one of their own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This subreddit is always good for a laugh.</p>

<p>A video showing an erratic and clearly mentally unstable driver refusing to stop for police officers, and then proceeding to flee without regard for the safety of the officers, citizens or the child in her car is somehow proof of police brutality?She then proceeded to lead officers on a chase until they were able to stop her and prevent who knows what from happening. Her having a child in the car does not suddenly make her innocuous or less of a threat.  People do terrible things to children everyday, why is everyone jumping to the conclusion that the police acted wrongly and not to the conclusion that perhaps she was the one to be feared.  With the navy yard incident just weeks ago, it shouldn&#39;t be surprising that someone who almost crashed through a security gate at the Capitol would be scene as an immediate threat.</p>

<p>You can go ahead and paint the poor, immigrant mother with a child was &#39;executed&#39; picture all you like, I&#39;d like to wait for the facts before crying conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;waving their guns around with no regard for the child in the car that they could clearly see.&quot; How the hell can you know that? In a flurry of activity there is no way that is for certain.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, they quickly hopped out of the way, guess cars can&#39;t excel human speed and reaction capabilities.&quot; ... So you&#39;re saying that a human cannot possibly jump out of the way of a moving vehicle because cars excel human speed and reaction capabilities? Utter nonsense.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe she was just scarred for her and her child&#39;s life and went into panic mode and took off, NOT injuring anyone.&quot; The only reason she didn&#39;t injure anyone was good reflexes and blind luck. </p>

<p>How can you honestly watch that video and come to a different conclusion?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t justify using a car as a weapon because some officers pulled a gun on you and issued you orders regardless whether you have a child in the car or not. Having a kid doesn&#39;t give you a run down anyone when you&#39;re afraid license.</p>

<p>VS</p>

<p>Video footage of the lady ignoring repeated police orders to stop, narrowly avoiding hitting officers with her car. Officers having to jump out of the way of the vehicle. Proceeds to then flee the scene. </p>

<p>Previously had rammed and passed through a barrier, hit another police officer before said footage was shot. = What actually happened.</p>

<p>Her motivations are unknown at this point, but the police have the right to defend their lives.</p>

<p>Also just a final note, the situation only threatened her childs life after she escalated it by nearly running down the officers, regardless if this was intentional or not. The officers didn&#39;t start shooting on sight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t see gun waving, I saw officers assessing a threat and letting the suspect know that their best option is to get out of the car, now. But she didn&#39;t, she forced her way out of the barricade almost hitting officers in the process, she then sped around the round about twice and took off all the while being pursued.  Not the actions of someone who is stable and not a threat to others (including her own child).  </p>

<p>I abhor actual incidents of police brutality, where an officer uses their power to physically or otherwise harm a citizen who is innocent of wrongdoing.  I also abhor when every time police have to do their job, people immediately cry brutality.  YOU go out there and deal with the threats that exist in the world today and let&#39;s see how good your decision making skills are when faced with reducing the threat to yourself and the other citizens you&#39;ve sworn to protect.  You have seconds to assess and react, and sometimes they get it wrong and sometimes they save lives, lots of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Driving aggressively is not synonymous with driving recklessly, by law at least. </p>

<p>Yes yes yes, how many times must I tell you I agree that she was fleeing, she <strong>DID drive at and or towards officers whom had surrounded her vehicle</strong> </p>

<p>I also would like to point out, they immediately surround her car with people instead of the rest of their cruisers. I feel like if that happened, she never would have been able to leave that spot and this whole ordeal never would have escalated to someone&#39;s life being lost. This is of course nothing more than opinion.</p>

<p>A human being scared for their life and the life of their child is more than enough reason to do uncharacteristic and admittedly stupid things. Again, not saying this <em>justifies</em> doing the things she did, it still doesn&#39;t justify shooting her dead.</p>
