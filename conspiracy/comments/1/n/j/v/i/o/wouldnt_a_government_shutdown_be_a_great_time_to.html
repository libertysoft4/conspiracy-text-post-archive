    <div class="md"><p>Today ISON made it&#39;s closest pass to Mars, around 2 degrees above an left of the planet.  At +12 magnitude, the comet is still impossible to see with the naked eye (it&#39;s about 600 times dimmer than what we can see with the naked eye), but it can be brought out with multiple stacked exposures.</p>

<p>Here it is using a Celestron 9.25&quot; @ 1480mm on Takahashi EM200 on Monday (15x180 second exposure):

<p>What is your question about the comet exactly?  It will be far more visible the closer it gets to the sun, which will happen over the coming weeks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a feeling that fukushima is behind a lot of this. I mean, only if the reports from the alternative news sites are correct, (the MSM stopped reporting on fukushima a long time ago.)</p>

<p>If the reports are true, fukushima is going to become the trigger. Imagine, many times more radiation than chernobyl. Many, many times more. Japan will be uninhabitable. Hawaii also, and from the looks of things, the entire west coast of america. Where are these people going to go? </p>

<p>You can make the speculation that this is why the fema camps exist, and why all the extra assets they have ordered. Millions upon millions of displaced peoples. This woukd cause chaos--the segway for martial law. </p>

<p>While our government plays the sleight of hand trick on us to focus our attention towards facetious &quot;news,&quot; fukushima readily pours out more and more radiation while incompetent workers make things worse. Afterall, if we knew that plans were being implemented for the east coast to suddenly house tens of millions of refugees, wed all flip shit. </p>

<p>Of course, if the reports on fukushima are correct. The shutdown couldve been staged using political differences as a scapegoat. Allowing nonessential personel to prepare, or to nix them from process, they could continue their final preparations without dissent until the final word. </p>

<p>Of course, this is all speculation. It would mean nothing, absolutely nothing, if the reports on fukushima from alternative news sites are wrong. </p>

<p>While we sit back and watch our parks close, lets keep an eye on fukushima...just in case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about feeding all these people? Healthcare for all of them? Tens of millions of refugees is almost unfathomable.

    <div class="md"><p>These comments seem to be the same old sort of moderately boring speculative points that are spouted off every two seconds here. But OP, you are certainly on the right track. I don&#39;t care about either side of the coin, i want to know who&#39;s flipping it. Compare this all with whats happening with the dollar and its obviously impending fate. As well as the fed reserve and elite banking cartels. They know they are going down imminently. If not NOW, then very soon. The fed is flying blind, and this is just the last smash and grab of the global banking elite. Rats scurrying to find the best holes before the tornado hits. Getting out alive/untouched is the race. Its obviously a hard thing to do when the dollar, everything its propped up on, and everything thats propping it up are increasingly and exponentially becoming meaningless. This is that &#39;thing&#39; that someone else is doing when &#39;no-one is around&#39;.</p>
