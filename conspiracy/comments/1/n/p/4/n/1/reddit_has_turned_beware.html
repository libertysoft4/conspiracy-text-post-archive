    <div class="md"><p>This line of reasoning is retarded. Regardless of its initial backing, Tor is an active open source project that has been independently vetted multiple times over by security professionals and outside developers alike.</p>

<p>But okay, let&#39;s assume that we can&#39;t rely on that, because this <em>is</em> <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, where paranoia is both most prevalent, and most likely to be realistic. Let&#39;s go by track record. Clearly DPR was caught because of flaws in Tor, right?</p>

<p>Nope. DPR got his real name dirty all over the place, cross-contaminated account names, all kinds of idiot rookie shit. The truly fascinating thing about it is that he wasn&#39;t caught <em>sooner.</em></p>

<p>Tor did its job superbly, but in the end, it can only go so far to protect you from your own stupidity. The superpower analogy would be &quot;even if you&#39;re using invisibility, people will still notice it if you go around spray-painting BILLY WUZ HERE on everything.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>slow down a second buddy, why would the feds go <em>out of their way</em> to proclaim that TOR is safe?</p>

<p>This is precisely what they did in the complaint files surrounding the silk road case. there are a host of things that are still very unclear about this whole thing, the Undercover cops that faked the whole murder thing, the &quot;random&quot; search that uncovered the fake IDs, etc. p.p</p>

<p>granted, at the moment it looks like DPR made a bunch of rookie mistakes, but you do not know that for certain at ALL. nothing is certain at the moment.</p>

<p>also, your claim that it is somehow widely accepted that TOR is safe is blatantly false, thre is no consensus on this matter and many &quot;experts&quot; say VPN and then tor is the only way to insure even a modicum of security</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you mean the next gen of anonymized browsing, I2P probably. It&#39;s pretty analogous to TOR, but has some competitive security features.</p>

<p>If you mean, &quot;I&#39;ve got TOR installed, now what?&quot;, then it basically boils down to this: don&#39;t do stuff that will identify you on the internet. TOR gets the fundamentals handled for you, so as long as you don&#39;t do anything in your browsing that ties to your identity, no one will be able to figure out who did those things.</p>

<p>Also, don&#39;t &quot;cross-contaminate&quot;, meaning associating one account with another. Reused usernames/passwords and all that. Your anon presence is like a Sudoku puzzle - the more numbers you give away (especially in the same box, or the same row, or the same column), the more easily the authorities can discover the relationships and fill in those blanks, tying everything together until it&#39;s enough for a warrant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re only half right. Tor held up its end of the bargain, and open source software is almost invariably more secure than its proprietary counterparts (where sabotage is an order of magnitude more difficult to detect).</p>

<p>On the other hand, yeah, DPR was a moron and managed to get his real name implicated all over the place, not to mention linked to a bunch of alt usernames. Very much a textbook case for leaving a breadcrumb trail right back to your doorstep - it&#39;s frankly a bit shocking he managed to hold out as long as he did, which really says something about the competence of federal investigators (not that you should be underestimating them, some teams are obviously more competent than others in a field that wide).</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_construction">Parallel construction is a police process of building a parallel - or separate - evidentiary basis for a criminal investigation which otherwise would rely upon evidence or tips received either from a confidential source or that might fall under the category of fruit of the poison tree. By building a separate evidentiary basis for an investigation, such as corroborating evidence using other resources or finding other valid reasons to investigate, prosecutors are able to avoid disclosing confidential or otherwise unusable evidence.[1]</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The comments are where you attack.  Pick any link and post the relevant shit that expands the story.  The information cannot be contained.  Take for example <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nmbd9/sopa_didnt_die_its_parts_live_on_as_executive/cck3w8d?context=3">this</a> post that expands what is being hidden regarding the TPP exposing it on the SOPA story.</p>

<p>In the mean time, new methods of disseminating information and news links should be sought out.   Expose the mods for burring important links like the NSA and create an alternative sub that competes with the corrupted sub reddits.  Point people to the <a href="/r/moderationlog">/r/moderationlog</a> to see what is being pulled from subs.</p>

<p>The war is not lost, rather the corruption has just changed tactics.  Its simply time to change ours.  If you stand static, the corruption will find a way to subdue the flow of information that poses resistance.</p>

I just didn&#39;t show the persons name because this is reddit and we are supposed to be anonymous on here... so I should protect others anonymity as well.

<p>I&#39;ve said some insane alcohol-fueled shit on the internet over the years. But I could do it with impunity... no accountability.</p>

<p>Sock puppets are another issue. I could theoretically create thousands of sock puppet accounts on reddit. I have no doubt there are hundreds of thousands of these logged in daily. The military, corporations, special interest groups.</p>

<p>Reddit will die eventually. The anonymous voting system is dog shit. It will never work... for us. It works flawlessly for the corporatocracy though.</p>

<p>I just have a gut feeling that to have a truely meaningful discussion -- about anything -- we&#39;re going to have to show our faces... to each other. Fuck the corporatocracy. As I said, they already know who we are but we have no idea who they are. That puts them a position to completely game the system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is up to as a community to upvote the correct material. To be honest, there has been no real juicy information leaked to the conspiracy forums or boards in years. It&#39;s all been the same rehashed dribble and a lot of it is coming from the government itself. I would like to see a new so called hidden circle unmasked, but it has yet to happen. I&#39;ve seen the same players over and over and over again whether it be members of Bilderberg, certain brotherhoods, Skull &amp; Bones, The 300&#39;s, Jesuits, Knights of Malta, JASONS, Navy, The Queen, certain Chinese families, Romans, Atlanteans, everything you name it I&#39;ve most likely seen it. The thing is, we never get any closer to solving things and the puzzle deep down of who&#39;s really our self appointed controller or controllers, and that&#39;s what troubles me.</p>
