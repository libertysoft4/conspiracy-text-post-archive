    <div class="md"><p>r/conspiracy is my favorite subreddit. There are many redditors here who have logically opinions. Sometimes we disagree, but when we do, we are able to respect eachothers point as both sides follow logical reasoning.</p>

<p>i also like r/conspiracy because it is the only place to actually conduct active discussions about conspiracies, whether we believe them or not, its fun and interesting to discuss things with like minded people.</p>

<p>the discussions that take place here are truely wonderful, even if sometimes a bit emotionally charged.</p>

<p>with all that said, it is truely a shame that the one place that exists to supposedly support the discussion of conspiracies tends to be most offended by them. Ive personally submitted quite a few posts, and just like the OP said, immediately they get downvoted. After a few hrs, when real conspiracy redditors actually have had time to digest the theories provided in my posts, there tends to be a lot of upvotes. These upvotes tend to correspond to submitted contributions to the post, while downvotes tend to be correlated with nothing, as if someone read the title, saw a conspiracy was being discussed, and downvoted without any earnest. </p>

<p>Point is, if you dont support discussions about conspiracies, you dont go on to those subreddits. </p>

<p>Like another poster said before me, when you eliminate those people who arent interested and dont peruse this subreddit, the only others left are those who contribute, and those who try and suppress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, its the contrary. Its not about posts i&#39;m interested in. It&#39;s about posts that promote discussions and free thinking. Those posts tend to get hammered by down-votes...</p>

<p>You seem to be confused by suggesting that there is a conventional community to override in the first place. This sub is filled with both serious contributors to conspiracies and shills/idiots that choose to hammer down every little bit of creativity that stands out from those who are bold enough to ask questions. If the community filters itself, so be it to have a system that equalizes everything so everyone gets an equal footing on their own beliefs and ideas.</p>

<p>Your sarcasm disgusts me. I am here to defend those who tried to enlighten others with their own ideas and yet I get you with your biased approach pulling an accusatory tone of selfishness.</p>

<p>And to be fair, I only used a ridiculous topic to make a point about keeping conversation open and free.  Every day  I see topics that seem outlandish or stupid, but instead of downvoting, unusually ignore them.  Why?  Because this forum should be a place where we can explore outlandish ideas, and I don&#39;t want to ruin it for other users who want to engage in said topics.</p>

<p>The people that want to disrupt this sub would love nothing more than to see the users here fight amongst ourselves, so we can&#39;t let that happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been coming to this community as a reader for awhile now maybe 2+ years and I have seen a big drop in valuable content compared to 6-12 months ago?  I would say that far to many people have come from closed minds and ruining this community for what it once was.  I also see this from libertarian sub as well.  I would think we&#39;re seeing a shift in some people, sadly those people are bringing over habits of old (it doesn&#39;t fit to my narrative so down vote).  Combine this was the attention conspiracy has got over time with shills etc, this is going to happen, and always seems to happen.  As well people may not understand the concept of when to use the up vote and down vote controls.</p>
