    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t strongly disagree with my Government until I gained insight from alternative news sources via the internet. If I were still watching CNN, like I was when I was 14, I&#39;d be as ignorant as most Americans. </p>

<p>The truth is my generation, and hopefully newer ones, are beginning to see our government for what it really is; and that truth is mainly propagated through the internet rather than mainstream sources. That shift in control of information is definitely putting a dent in the Government&#39;s power to limit what we see. </p>

<p>The internet is a threat to the powers that be. People are becoming more dissatisfied with their representatives everyday, now that they don&#39;t have to rely on biased news sources. Some people may radicalize and choose to resort to a direct attack, but at this point I don&#39;t personally care and in the future, if things ever got real bad, I may even support it. </p>

<p>Anyway, they need to control the internet soon. If they don&#39;t, we&#39;ll be out in the streets and very angry. So they&#39;ll push for more control over the internet, and we may let it happen. So far, most attempts at fucking us over haven&#39;t gotten too far; I hope it stays like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s building but running parallel to that knowledge is the sense that things are being implemented to make things more difficult for everyone. Right now the US government have the power to declare martial law under ambiguous &#39;emergencies&#39;, they can intercept any communication no matter what it is, they can arrest people in secret under more ambiguously worded laws and they can put out propaganda lawfully to the American people. </p>

<p>All of this put together a long with the increased militarisation of local and state police, the increasing reach of the DHS and the amount of bullshit they can get away with doesn&#39;t paint a good picture. I&#39;ve seen people dismiss this over the years and pass it all off because &quot;it&#39;s been like this for years, nothing has happened&quot;. And yeah, nothing has reached critical mass yet - but that doesn&#39;t mean nothing is being carefully being put into place, it&#39;s just that people seem to not look at things in a broader sense. People think there is some time frame that tyranny has to conform to so if it doesn&#39;t happen in ten years, then it&#39;s not happened at all.</p>

<p>Since 9/11 and The Patriot Act, look how much the security apparatus has expanded, look how much else has been justified under the guise of terrorism and ask yourself if you think these people in power have your best interests at heart when all they do is show utter disdain for you. They haven&#39;t suddenly become empathetic and nice, they just put on a smiley face and say if (insert thing doesn&#39;t become law) then bad things will happen. It&#39;s always based on an emotional response because the facts don&#39;t justify what they want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The wealthy want to make sure the people are unarmed and helpless. It reminds me of Japan. When the west first contacted Japan one of the things they sold was guns. It didn&#39;t take long before armed peasants started to rebel. A peasant with a gun was more than the equal of a samurai warrior paid and controlled by the wealthy. After a nearly successful rebellion the Japanese closed the country to foreign contact and made guns illegal. So the people were completely subjugated until after WWII.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gee. It couldn&#39;t be anything to do with the fact that they grew up and watched their brothers and friends recruited straight out of their high schools(which they were required to attend) by paid killers to go off and fight/die in wars which were later admitted to have been based on <em>lies and complete fabrications</em>, where 1,000,000 or so have died and tens of thousands of Americans have lost everything, died, or been maimed for life.</p>

<p>Then, the groups of criminals who are responsible for all of these deaths continued to walk free, and the idiots in the &quot;mainstream&quot;(government-controlled media issuing two seemingly opposing sides of one main social narrative) defend them and ignore their crimes while trying to convince us all to keep sending our kids / brothers / friends to die in these illegal wars based on lies. These criminals are also using money they extract from the population at gunpoint to pay their footmen/security details, and if you don&#39;t give them 20-50% of <em>all the income you ever receive</em> they will send their soldiers/footmen to come knock down your door and kidnap you, or worse if you resist being dragged out of your home at gunpoint even a little bit.</p>

<p>No big deal, right guys, just more ruin and death than any terrorist group/gang/criminal organization has <em>ever caused period</em> in the modern world. Anyone opposing the war-agendas and questioning the bullshit lies put out by <em>people who have proven themselves more than capable of lying to the entire country in ways that will result in massive wars</em> are called &quot;radicals&quot; by the new propagandists(<em>everyone on television news, as all of those networks are wholly owned by the same corporate overlords that own the US government</em>) - because hey, some random angry muslims are scarier than that. ^</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s the fact that trillions of dollars are being extracted from America in secret deals by organizations whose agents will either blatantly lie to congressmen/senators or simply <em>refuse to answer</em> questions directed at them about <strong>THE LARGEST WEALTH TRANSFERS IN HUMAN HISTORY</strong>. That could have something to do with it, right? Pretty sure &quot;the terists&quot; aren&#39;t doing that. The masses are being robbed and the presidency was in the hands of an ex-CIA strongman/social climber named George Bush who then passed the throne to his son, Bush II, who together started multiple wars killing thousands of Americans based on total and complete lies, while giving the Lordship of Florida to another relative - a family that has since bought large pieces of land in a country without a functional criminal extradition treaty with the US. </p>

<p>Then their &quot;opposition&quot; comes to power, does <em>nothing</em> about that, breaks all campaign promises to the people, become the opposite of what they promise to be, and talk about how &quot;the internet is radicalizing people&quot;. No, the actions of the criminals who have silently seized power in DC are what is &quot;radicalizing the youth&quot;, the internet is just the only as yet uncontrolled outlet they have to receive factual/unspun(not propaganda) information about it. None of our &quot;representatives&quot; use their power to do anything about it aside from an infinite variety of committees they use to make themselves look &quot;tough on crime&quot;/&quot;tough on the bankers&quot;/&quot;tough on issue X/&quot;tough on illegal wiretapping&quot; in the media while doing <em>nothing about it</em> as they are being paid by the people they are investigating while in reality we are all being forced to pay them to spy on us and they all know it&#39;s &quot;legal&quot; through a backdoor pushed through by King Bush II and his legal aids. We pay or they&#39;ll come take us away.</p>
