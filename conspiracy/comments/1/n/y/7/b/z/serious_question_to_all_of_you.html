    <div class="md"><p>It is the warped views that our controlled society has implanted in our brains over generations that gives you faith in humanity. Humans as creatures are savages. Sure if we live in a collective long enough we develop better ways of life but when it comes down to the basic instincts, we are only concerned with our own survival. You wouldn&#39;t have a clue what was moral and what wasn&#39;t if it wasn&#39;t fed to you from birth.</p>

<p>Immediately following the collapse, the shock of sudden lawlessness will revert a good percentage of mankind back to bandits and outlaws. Not having any authority types to keep order, those &quot;no go spots&quot; OP was talking about will be a very real thing. The places that are more likely to maintain a level of civility, are the small communities in the country, away from the cities and suburbs. The cities and &#39;burbs will be the spots that will attract all the &quot;bad seeds&quot; because, again immediately following the collapse, they will be trying to loot and pillage everything that used to be valuable, forcing the &quot;civilized folk&quot; out of the area.</p>

<p>Whenever this inevitable collapse happens, it will drastically alter the moral compass of every individual and change our set of values. It is impossible to say what any of us will do when put in that situation because none of us have ever been there. All we can do is look back at what history shows us, and history shows us that the weak will not inherit the earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not true. Humanity chooses living vs. death and violence in the grand scheme of things. I understand wars and yada yada, but if humanity didn&#39;t know how to deal with it, we wouldn&#39;t be were we are today. You have to understand that something like complete government collapse, would cause a good kind of chaos. Yes shit would be crazy, but people still want to exist. What I think has been ingrained in to peoples heads, is that failure in the economy equals the failure of humanity. Its nothing. Thats how it should be. We should not have to rely on a &quot;government&quot; and pointless currency to live. Life will go on, better them what youre programed to think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>just for the sake of others, don&#39;t bother to respond. People in Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal, England, pretty much any where there is a people that have been oppressed and those same people do not want to shoot their fellow man. Riots are pretty much reserved for the unarmed and those with out the organization to wage a meaningful battle. Riots happen out of anger, usually with government. You asked who riots, people with a cause and nothing else to lose. Those who have lost all. People who will not self immolate, but want to live, free from dictates of the wealthy, free from oppression. It used to be us, our founding fathers rioted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think citizens and local communities will step up and take on the responsibility to police themselves. kinda like it was before the 80&#39;s. decentralized community based policing. not the bullshit we have know. I am not a huge fan of policing anyways. I believe protection should be our own responsibility and if you are a re victim, that it&#39;s most likely your own fault. some people need protecting, the young and elderly, but is that societies job, or family?  just saying it won&#39;t be the same as it is now, if this happens which is less than probable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude, I hope selling out your fellow man is worth it to you. Either you are a shill, or just a dumb person. Either way, you have sold out future generations. By working for the oppressors, or just by being uneducated. First, you have no command of the English language, or any language that I am aware of. The whole point of language is to be able to convey your thoughts to others in an understandable way. Second, your comment history is poor, you offer no viable input to any conversation, seems like &quot;bro&quot; talk at best. If you cannot spell hating and WTFE &quot;dissin&quot; is, I have no time for your petty thoughts. Thank You, and good day sir.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not thionk this will be a full blown waste land, many countries have defaulted, either by not paying bonds, or inflation. I think inflation will be how we default, won&#39;t be a walk in the park, many will die by their neighbors hands. I think great depression style, only worse, because no one can produce or store their own goods. pantries run dry, people will get desperate. however this is one of the most generous nations. some will help others out, until they realize help is not on the way. just my opinion, and I hope I am wrong.</p>
