<p>That the WTC actually fell because of bombs placed by agents of the global elite? That the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax to take away the second amendment to create a totalitarian police state? That JFK was killed by the Zionists for opposing their iron fist? That the Boston Bombing was a false flag event? That the Syrian uprising against the noble Assad was because of their resistance to the NWO and a profitable natural gas pipeline? That the sanctions on Iran are because they oppose the Rothschilds banking empire? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if there was a cover-up, correlation does not imply causation. Perhaps it was the ineptitude of the government to protect their president from crazed psychos that was covered up... This does not mean that it was the intention of the Global Elites to kill the President because they couldn&#39;t control him.</p>

<p>People here claim that their ideas and opinions are facts. I never hear the &quot;I think&quot; or &quot;I wonder if...&quot; It&#39;s always &quot;JFK <em>was</em> assasinated by the Rothschilds for executive order 11110 because it would diminish their power.&quot; As soon as a plausible story is uncovered, it is treated like the truth. Just because a plausible story is plausible doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s true or that it withstands scrutiny. </p>

<p>All of these conspiracies build up on other conspiracies. If there was no Rothschilds-family controlled central banking empire controlling hundreds of countries, then the premise of that theory is false. </p>

<p>Kennedy could have been assassinated by someone paid by the Republican party for unknown reasons. 9/11 may have been orchestrated by terrorists and could have been stopped because of insider information known to Mossad but someone chose not to. Alternatively, someone may have not listened to Mossad because they were incompetent and the government tried to cover that up. These are simplistic, plausible conspiracy theories. But nobody here talks about them because they are not premised on the foundations of a central, omnipotent yet incompetent Evil Global Power, which conspiracy theorists take for granted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is that it implies heavily there was a conspiracy to cover up the facts, which in turn heavily implies either a) they were hiding the incompetence etc of the Warren Commision itself(not terribly unlikely) or b) the report they gave was at best incomplete and at worst misleading.</p>

<p>Not every conspiracy is tied to others; the most plausible theory about 9-11 I read about was that the Port Uthority had skimped on the construction of the towers(which were, if you&#39;ll recall, designed to withstand the force of a plane smashing into them). This also would explain why no one was allowed to examine the rubble and why it was carted away so fast. I should hardly need to mention that the official explanation of the 9-11 attacks is a classic conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>It fits the fact pattern, it explains Building 7, it explains the &quot;why did they collapse if they were designed to endure&quot;, it explains the post-cleanup behaviour, and it has no more mystery to it than people covering their asses &amp; human greed. </p>

<p>Sometimes a conspiracy is the simplest, best explanation. And conspiracies abound. Enron was a conspiracy to rig energy prices. The bailout was a conspiracy to build consumer confidence. The shutdown is a conspiracy to stop Obamacare.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: You don&#39;t need a tinfoil hat with matching underwear to notice that small groups of people with like interests get together to manipulate what they can in the world to their own advantage.</strong></p>

<p>I only defined truth as a contrast to speculation. How do you think I defined truth?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your certainly not going to get it through mainstream media.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not 100% of the time, but why not 95+% of the time? You already have several assumptions before you got to the conclusion that you will never get truth from the mainstream media...</p>

<p>If I can&#39;t get truth from the mainstream media, why would I find it here? I think the speculation here is advertised as fact, which betrays a lack of self-insight. Why should I trust people who lack insight into their own cognitive processes? It&#39;s not more true just because you thought it or someone underground posited it... </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So, you listen to me. Listen to me: Television is not the truth! Television is a God-damned amusement park! Television is a circus, a carnival, a traveling troupe of acrobats, storytellers, dancers, singers, jugglers, side-show freaks, lion tamers, and football players. We&#39;re in the boredom-killing business! So if you want the truth... Go to God! Go to your gurus! Go to yourselves! Because that&#39;s the only place you&#39;re ever going to find any real truth.</p>

<p>But, man, you&#39;re never going to get any truth from us. We&#39;ll tell you anything you want to hear; we lie like hell. We&#39;ll tell you that, uh, Kojak always gets the killer, or that nobody ever gets cancer at Archie Bunker&#39;s house, and no matter how much trouble the hero is in, don&#39;t worry, just look at your watch; at the end of the hour he&#39;s going to win. We&#39;ll tell you any shit you want to hear. We deal in <em>illusions</em>, man! None of it is true!</p>

<p>I read multiple sources on a daily basis.  There are multiple perspectives.  Of course most of us don&#39;t have time to consider them all, but for those that do, it is nice to have an aggregate and this is not the ultimate source of that!</p>
