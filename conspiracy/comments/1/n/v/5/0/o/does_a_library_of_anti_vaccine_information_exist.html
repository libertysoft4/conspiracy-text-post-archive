Seeing friends/people reposting pro vaccine &quot;reminders&quot;. 
This is worrisome for me and I understand there are equal amounts of dis-info on either side but there must be credible sources of anti-vaccines information that has been agreed upon? Thanks community I am looking forward on seeing what results if any are to come. I am a green horn to Reddit so I am unsure on what to expect from posing questions. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You will NEVER find consensus on a PRODUCT that is both dangerous and lucrative! That is why I default to the CHOICE argument. Allow people to choose and then it is up to them to decide. I choose not to as I will NEVER believe what the ALLOPATHIC medical COMPLEX has to say about vaccination or any other medicine...we live in an age of consciousness and ANYTHING that is demanded of people, without the raising of consciousness over the issue, is fascism or parenting...and I am not about to let the state become my PARENT! And as they have already taken the path of fascism...I demand the right to choose. I believe in blood transfusion but I am not about to FORCE a Jehovah&#39;s Witness to get one. We have to respect each others choices in a free society whether we like them or not. What is freedom? What is love?

<p>Half truths are what damage society and &quot;vaccine preventable disease&quot; is totally a half truth.</p>

<p>All I am asking for around vaccination is <em>informed consent</em>...(which means full disclosure to the possible hazards of the medication...that&#39;s the <em>informed</em> part...which is not being done by any nurse who doesn&#39;t provide the patient with the warnings provided on the manufacturer&#39;s inserts ...and freedom of choice...which is the <em>consent</em> portion...which mean the patient wants the medical procedure to be performed upon them and they are giving permission to the medical establishment to inject them with the agreed upon substance.</p>

The elimination of poverty, filthy living and working conditions, and the creation of modern sewage systems did more for the health of the poor and the well to do, than any medicine, vaccination or otherwise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that the &quot;thin veneer of control&quot; is sliding away from most traditional &quot;authorities&quot; and they are grasping at straws trying to control the freedom of information era. Outright censorship is coming if we don&#39;t get a handle on that!</p>

<p>The reaction from the AUTHORITY is a sure sign that something is up. Vaccines and GMOS are two excellent examples of this polarity. If GMOs are so safe and good for you why would they resist labeling? If the science is so proven about vaccines why are the people who SIMPLY QUESTION the party line crucified in public with such vehemence? It is because there is REASON to doubt. And cognitive dissonance has been used in the vaccine industry for years and years so that too is a bit of a red flag! </p>

<p>All anti-vaccine sources are NOT considered credible. The entire reason I started to question vaccines is because when I asked about side effects and/or reports that indicated that this may not be a safe medical procedure I got nothing but derision back from the doctor. This is what made me look into it and eventually find the truth...which is simply this...they are experimental serums and they have unseen and unstudied dangers and the fact that they are promoted as 100% safe and effective should be a red flag for EVERYONE! No science is infallible and they claim that vaccine science is! Fuck that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad. I have had a short email discussion with Dr. Suzanne directly and she is amazing. She has stopped her anti-vaccine crusade and now concentrates her efforts on TREATING the vaccine damaged (and there are many) and on EDUCATION...that polio film blew me away...I knew some of the stuff but not all of it. AMAZING!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously you didn&#39;t watch the link I gave you. There are NO reasons to believe these institutions. I find the automatic belief in them to be dangerous and stupid. If you look carefully at the history of all allopathic medicine, there is NEVER room for criticism (until they are forced to) and all alternative viewpoints are demonized...always. Even when they are right. </p>

<p>r/conspiracy readers please watch this link...in the spirit of skepticism and truth dare yourself to open your eyes to the POLIO debacle. The vaccine DID NOT ELIMINATE POLIO! Watch and learn...</p>
