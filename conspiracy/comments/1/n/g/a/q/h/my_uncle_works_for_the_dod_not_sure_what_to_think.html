        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, my uncle works for the Department of Defense, I&#39;m not sure what his job title is or exactly what he does. He has been with the D.O.D. for a while now (over 15 years) and was also a high ranked officer in the Marines for years before he started with the D.O.D. Anyways, he came in town from  Atlanta this weekend to visit and was acting extremely odd the whole time he was around my family. The whole time he was home he seemed to be preoccupied, not very talkative,  and just acting strange in general. Last night before he went back to Atlanta he sat down with my grandparents, cousins and other uncles and said some offbeat shit that really made me feel uncomfortable and scared. He told us all he needed to talk to us, (I was thinking he was going to tell us he was getting remarried because he has been getting pretty serious with a woman he has been dating.) He told us that within the next month there is a high chance that things are going to &quot;get ugly&quot; on the east coast (where we all live). He said he wasn&#39;t sure what is happening or what is going to happen. He said that within the next 2-3 weeks he is being relocated to Virginia Beach from Atlanta because it is possible that they will need some help in that area. I asked him if they thought we were going to be attacked or if it was an economic issue or what? He told me that he truly did not know, but the people in his &quot;department&quot; had been warned of &quot;citizen uprisings&quot; and possible &quot;domestic and/or non-domestic disputes&quot; and that many of the D.O.D. officials with high levels military experience were being moved to port areas along the east coast. I was asking him every question I could think of and he really had no answers for me and seemed to be in the dark besides what I have already shared with you. I also asked him that if this were an event of any significance then what type of plan should we have and where should we go? He said, that if any significant attack or uprising really did happen that everything would be locked down, but with all the emphasis that the D.O.D. is putting on the east coast the he would definetly head West if anything were to happen and travel was allowed.  I am normally a pretty skeptical person and do not believe everything I hear without some sort of proof or documentation to back it up, but this is seriously freaking me out as it came from a family members mouth and he was serious as a heart attack when he told my family. Does anyone have any idea about what this could be over? (the possibilities are endless, i know) I apoligize in advance for not having any sort of proof to back this up, b/c I  know most people in this subreddit are skeptics just as I am. I really do not want to put my uncle at any risk for anything he has said.. Plus I am not sure how to prove a conversation. If anyone has any possible information or insight on what this could be over, please share. Or if anyone has seen or heard anything out of the norm on the east coast in the past month please share. I am freaking the fuck out over this and trying to make some sense of it. I realize that this could be some sort of preparedness drill, and that nothing may happen at all and that is what I am hoping, but any info is appreciated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the compliment.  I&#39;m talking storage space, not computing power.  Those two things are <em>distinctly</em> different.  So... we&#39;re just going to fuck around and not try to objectively see how much storage it would actually take to hold all the information?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have the processor power, and the length of time it takes to process a query on any given user. This, coupled with the common knowledge that it entails a three-hop process to track all individuals should provide you with the storage dedicated to any given user - given, again, that you&#39;re a math genius.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only you have endowed me with the math genius title.  I&#39;m talking of physical storage space, about which you have still not replied.  Lets quit yanking our cocks and get down to business - How much physical storage would it take to store information on every person in the U.S.?  We can start with a rough estimate of how many TB or PB of storage would be needed (we first need to make an estimate of the average storage requirement of the data of each person, then we can multiply that by the number of folks in the U.S.).  We can then see about what kind of hardware requirements would be necessary to store all of the information, and go from there.  Not talking about parsing the data just yet, only figuring out the storage requirements.  We&#39;ll get to the good parts soon enough.</p>

<p>So, I say 1GB per person would be about right.  What do you say?  Too much?  Too little?</p>

<p>P.S.  That &quot;three-hop process&quot; you made up doesn&#39;t help us figure this shit out at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure anyone of significance would give two shits that, even if it were all true, the 500 or so here saw it. The entire strategy is marginalization and cognitive dissonance. What OP said is a conspiracy theory, which is automatically wrong, because if it were true, people would talk about it. But when OP talks about it, he is labeled a conspiracy theorist. It is a beautifully constructed catch-22 that makes most censorship completely unnecessary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can think of at least three reasons why this October 1st thing could be disinfo.  1)  Its scary.  It scares people away from conspiracy theory.  2)  It makes it so that conspiracy theorists look like they are always the boy who cried wolf.  3)  It distracts people from theorizing or analyzing the government shutdown.  On the other hand, a shut down of all Federal Agencies with the exception of military ones sure seems to have some implications of its own.</p>

<p>As far as possible catastrophes on the east coast are concerned, the only one I&#39;ve heard of is the collapse of the volcanic ridge of Cumbre Vieja on La Palma Island in the Canary Islands. This would supposedly send a &quot;mega tsunami&quot; crashing against the east coast of the US.

<p>Using D.C. as an example, and the B-83 as a possible nuke (the largest in the US arsenal), <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KtkupkX.jpg">the fireball itself would vaporize most of D.C. proper</a>. Radiation would saturate the entire area up to a 5 or 6 miles from the blast itself.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that easy any more.  In 2001, obviously it was that easy to just plant a big FF, blame whoever the administration wanted, and then have the entire country clamoring to go to war with that made up adversary.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that easy anymore - even if tptb DID nuke an entire city and even if there were even more casualties than there were on 911.</p>

<p>The people, the citizenry know a LOT more about how shitty tptb are now.  We know just how evil and against us they actually are.  I think even the average person would begin to question the validity of who the administration would say is responsible for an attack.  Their FFs are starting to not have the same effect on the &quot;dumb masses&quot; as they once did...because the masses are beginning to slowly wake up.</p>

<p>As fast as tptb ignite a FF attack and get their MSM to start beating the drums of war on whoever they want to attack? that&#39;s how fast it&#39;s seeming the alternative media is beginning to punch holes in the administration&#39;s stories.  All the more recent FFs haven&#39;t had as great an effect as tptb have wanted because the masses are seeing through them as being nothing but murderous attacks on the people themselves and so we&#39;re not going for the attacks as quickly if at all.  We&#39;re not taking their bait.</p>

<p>Well, yes.  We <em>are</em> pretty stupid - we keep going around and around like gerbils on a wheel - but the fact of the matter is that, as I said above, a lot of the FFs TPTB have engaged in as of late <em>have</em> been greatly questioned by the people and the alternative media, etc - so that&#39;s not a bad sign that the people - stupid and indoctrinated like sheep as so many of us are - are not starting to buy the administration&#39;s rabble as much as before.</p>

<p>Yeah.  It sucks.  Lots of people still are very, very lost.  My gf was just as bad if not a <em>lot</em> worse than your sister I&#39;m sure - but...well, she either had to stop being my gf or start waking up because I kept questioning and thinking critically and talking about all these issues, and she began to realize through conversations we had and fits and starts that a lot of things really don&#39;t add up at all.  She&#39;s still not as focused as I am in that area, but she&#39;s a <em>lot</em> more aware now than ever.</p>

<p>Reddit is by no means the only source of information as it pertains to calling tptb out on their bullshit.  Independent of reddit - or, more specifically, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and similar subreddits (as many other subs, I would say, suck balls majorly) - there is, like I mentioned, the <em>alternative media</em>.  THAT calls out their bullshit often as well - not just <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> - and information can be had there.</p>

<p>Regardless, however, even if NO ONE goes online after a nuke attack - which, of course, would be ENTIRELY understandable - or even <em>can</em> go online, the fact of the matter is that the general public I would say now has a general feeling of distrust and great skepticism with regard to pretty much anything the administration says is the case.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like this:  If something bad happens - a nuke goes off, some horrible terrorist attack, or whatever else - and you want to find out exactly who <em>DIDN&#39;T</em> do it, then hurry up, turn on the tv, and listen to who the MSM immediately rushes to blame and calls for the American people to &quot;attack in retaliation&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s <em>that</em> bad, and a lot of people are beginning to wake up to know this.  Some of us know this so well now that we don&#39;t need anything like reddit to tell us this.  We already <em>know</em>.  We don&#39;t need to got to reddit to understand this.</p>

<p>So no.  I don&#39;t think any &quot;reddit surfing&quot; would be necessary at all in order for people to begin to really question who the administration says is to blame if a nuke went off in an American city.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The internet kill switch would be used.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not super certain it would matter any more.  I mean I&#39;m certainly not speaking for everyone here - or really anyone other than myself - but I know that I certainly WOULDN&#39;T be buying the government&#39;s story about who it was (<em>especially</em> if they rush to blame the &quot;obvious American enemies&quot; in Syria or Iran or Russia or China, for example).  I&#39;ve seen too much and have researched too much at this point.  There&#39;s a lot I&#39;m ignorant about, but I <em>do</em> know that the government and those ptb that are way above the government controlling it are NOT on the side of the public <em>at all</em>.  I don&#39;t need reddit to know that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am willing to bet cold hard cash this will not happen and you are talking shit. This subreddit is like an open asshole of pseudo intellectuals just dribbling shitty facts into ears wide open to receive shit. Anything with an anti-American agenda is gobbled up like a thanksgiving turkey. </p>

<p>Your comment disregards the recent news of Iran saying they will never build nukes and the beginning of talks between the USA and Iran. Of course this could be a load of rubbish designed to trick everyone but I doubt it. </p>

<p>As I said there is no way your idea will happen and if it is, well the millions dead will be proof enough that I was wrong. In the meantime you are a fear mongering fool. </p>

<p>With that being said I love these crazy tin foil hat conspiracy theories and that is why I subscribe here. </p>

<p>No, thats vote hiding and is done by the subreddit mods as an effort to fight &quot;bandwagon voting&quot;, vote fuzzing is when they pad the total downvotes and total upvotes to throw off spammers, the exact voting algorithm is a secret and the only part of reddit code that isn&#39;t open source.  The net votes are accurate, however.  A post that shows 42k up and 40k down in reality might have 2.5k up and 500 down.</p>

<p>Nice job digging through my comment history to toss on an irrelevant insult that has no bearing on my knowledge of reddit vote totaling, yes, I work in a grocery store, not everyone is privileged enough to get free ride through college from mommy and daddy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read this a few hours ago, and when I got home I made a call... </p>

<p>I have a friend in the military who lives in the Virginia Beach (Hampton Road) area, gave the run down of this post to him, he told me they&#39;re running all kinds of new equipment drills (mainly electronic stuff) on their ship, but nothing out of the ordinary as all the drills have been coming down the pipe for months. He gave his dad a call. his dad works for the DOD in the area, same kind of background as your uncle (former high ranking marine, turned private sector after retirement, got into the DOD about 15 years ago), and he doesn&#39;t know of any major plans but says in the event of a large scale people revolt, there isn&#39;t a person in his sector that would stand up against them (being the revoltist), he says there has been a lot of &quot;watercolor talk&quot; and wouldn&#39;t be surprised if something is on the horizon which could be scary to some people, but as long as the UN stays out of the US, we have (and i quote) &quot;a shit load of people ready to back a revolution&quot; so that&#39;s my two cents...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The Kaibiles are infamous for their reputed practice of forcing recruits to kill animals, which includes raising a puppy and bonding with it before killing and eating it, as well as biting the heads off live chickens. In addition, recruits are shot and forced to perform field surgery on themselves, and to drink water out of recently fired artillery shells. As part of the course&#39;s finishing ritual, every recruit must drink &quot;Bomb&quot;, a mix of tequila, whiskey, rum, beer, water, and gunpowder, served in a bamboo glass with a bayonet tied to it. Soldiers must drink it carefully, so as not to get drunk and cut themselves with the bayonet. Once they successfully complete this ritual, they are inducted into the Kaibiles&quot;</p>

<p>The amount of people in this sub who 
A) Have no idea what the fuck is going on
and
B) Use the absence of knowledge to insert their own fears
is really ridiculous. </p>

<p>How about this for a no-evidence theory. OP is actually from 4chan having a grand ol ball poking all the scared people here. Not to say I&#39;ve ever done that before with conspiracy theorists or anything. :-\ </p>

<p>The skittishness of this whole thing... when something finally does happen the lack of rigor here makes any of your suppositions useless. Its the boy who cried wolf. The internet and expecially these chunks of it are not helping anything, you aren&#39;t warning people, you aren&#39;t getting a message out.. you&#39;re fear jerking. Evidence, or gtfo.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m here because I love mysteries, strange things that don&#39;t add up. I was really into things like the Bermuda triangle, bigfoot, etc when I was young, and I never really got over the sadness that when you critically investigate any of them, they&#39;re just stories. Mundane things usually with simple explanations. People being people. So these places are where I go to read about stories and mysteries we don&#39;t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gov. Shutdown on Oct 1, followed by continued congressional bickering, leading to a failure to figure out the debt ceiling problem that&#39;s coming due on Oct 17, leading to layoffs in large numbers as companies struggle to stay afloat without the support of Federal grants/backup leads to people getting fed up and taking to the streets.</p>

<p>Most likely fear of the D.O.D. in my opinion. </p>

<p>As for East coast- financial sector&#39;s in New York. D.C. is over there, high concentration of the people that are blamed for the problem. Once one city rises up, others will likely follow nearby (as opposed to random rioting being spurred on in LA due to people flooding the streets in Virginia).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the most logical possibility based on the information available. The Govt. shutdown is just a sneaky way of pushing austerity in America. The whole economic system is a farce and the Fed can&#39;t keep printing funny money forever. By masking it as the product of a petty dispute between Dems/Repubs they manage to keep the populace divided on the same nonsense party lines, but as a backup they would prepare for any mass protests/ unrest by getting the DOD ready to violently suppress any backlash. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. BR was the reason i first started questioning the things I was being taught during my formative years, especially my place within the catholic church (I don&#39;t remember hearing how Moses reacted when the innocent first born sons laid dead). I had a feeling i was being fed bullshit and they were the first people to tell me it was okay to ask questions and disagree with the status quo. Highly recommended for anyone who has a feeling that something is very wrong with this world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>JUST nothing. I mean, I don&#39;t know if I believe this. I used to be a trucker and though a pretty conservative lot are very independent minded- even the company men. I guess you could get enough drivers that will stop taking loads to the DC area to cause a shortage of something (probably fuel). Its shitty enough that I&#39;d never have driven there again. </p>

<p>But think about who would be getting hurt. Certainly not the elites who can simply leave or be shuttled, choppered (emergency tunnel under the Patomic?) out. Now I used to drive reefers- refrigerated trucks so I did a lot of food loads. Your typical grocery store (or any at this point) uses a &quot;Just in Time&quot; inventory system to reduce shelf time and increase profits. It also means that once a local emergency is declared, that store is out of food in less than a day. 2 or three under normal operations.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not as certain of distribution centers- there are all types and sizes- hell Kraft even has a 200 foot deep underground city-sized facility with 100 foot tall ceilings in Springfield Missouri that sees hundreds of trucks per day. But I digress. </p>

<p>The point is, once the tractor trailers stop moving- for whatever reason- you have maybe 2 days at the most before the food riots start- and like I said, less than that once word gets out. Food doesn&#39;t move from loading docks, from intermodal transfer centers in railyards and harbors, all the food you have left, is whatever you have. And the larger the affected the region, the longer the infrastructure to end or prevent the inevitable bedlam will take to re-establish.</p>

<p>Those of you that volunteered at the Points of Distribution handing out food, water, and ice after Hurricane Ike know what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a little story: FEMA dropped the ball, &#39;misplacing&#39; 3 million cases of MREs from regional warehouses, that which was left went towards feeding first responders, local shelters and those evacuated from the worst hit areas- Galveston, San Leon, Bacliff, people that lived in Galveston bay through Baytown IIRC. The Red Cross brought some in- but they were privatized. Regional store chains actually stepped in and saved the day. HEB, Kroger and Piggly Wiggly put together I have no idea how many commercial meals made from their own stocks. They even provided most of the trucks as you can see from this pic:</p>

<p><a href="http://i230.photobucket.com/albums/ee82/Dayanx/IKE/POD1.jpg">http://i230.photobucket.com/albums/ee82/Dayanx/IKE/POD1.jpg</a></p>

<p>This line was about half a mile long; wrapping around the block to a Point of Distribution. The problem is people were still going without because the PODs were placed politically, with local councilmen fighting over them and placing them where trucks had the worst time getting in or out. Trucks were getting stuck, and with fuel hard to come by, they were running out. The other problem was that some PODs were getting food and ice but no water, or water but no food. and there were some ridiculously unprepared and pissed off people that were going without food for that day. (They would only hand out only enough food for that day, and only for two people for each person that showed up)</p>

<p>Sorry for the wall of text, but I helped with security, and have seen just how little it takes to knock people off that sagging branch they call civilization.</p>

<p>Oh, here&#39;s a gas line- there were cardboard bales and carts set up in barricade to try to prevent fights over gas. At that point I think that was one of only two or three places that had gasoline in the entire city of Houston.

    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily. I once did a story at a highway weigh station and trucks were routinely coming in with loads of up to 80,000lbs or more. The weigh stations never check the cargo against the bills of lading; they just weigh the truck and pass it on thru if it&#39;s OK. A truck lined with lead weight, but otherwise empty, would simply truck on down the road with no problems.</p>

<p>EDIT. This is how loads of car batteries move around, too. A truck will only be loaded up about halfway, maybe 750 batteries or something. Each one weighs maybe 80lbs...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was a FEMA class, not a drill in any way. You can also take the class <a href="http://emilms.fema.gov/IS366/index.htm">right now online</a> if you want to see what it&#39;s about. It&#39;s a very high-level introduction on how to plan for children in disasters. There&#39;s nothing about active shooters in there. It&#39;s more about remembering to include diapers in flood shelters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, since everyone else is &quot;checking in,&quot; i thought id report as well. Iblive something like ninety miles south of DC, and recently visited DC. Saw two black unmarked helicopters flying fairly low. This was around the time the UN General Assembly was in time. I also saw a &quot;normal&quot; grey helicopter (looked like a blackhawk). </p>

<p>But, probably three weeks prior to that, i saw three of the same flying just over my town of 26,000 people. Also, just a few days ago, i saw a C130 (those military cargo planes) flying quite low for some reason. </p>

<p>Now, keep in mind i live almost right in the middle of three huge military bases. Ive seen military planes before, but it wasnt ever really this often, its not a usual occurance. But, ill reserve my conspiracies till further evidence is acquired. </p>

<p>Oh, lastly, during the NASA launch in sept at wallops island, va (their second launch, sept 17th i think?) I saw a fighter jet cruisin the skies. He was alone from what i could see. </p>

<p>Anyhow, even with all the military planes ive seen, ive never seen the black unmarked helicopters before. Ever. That was the weirdest of them all. Straight black, no markings.</p>

<p>What you are describing is the gvt preparing to defend themselves against the population because they are about to do something that the people don&#39;t want to happen.</p>

<p>This was my previous prediction on the october event subject:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1mvd7b/how_is_this_supposed_october_takedown_going_to/cccyd7v">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1mvd7b/how_is_this_supposed_october_takedown_going_to/cccyd7v</a></p>

<p>But if what you say is true then I really believe in an impending WW, let&#39;s hope that this and my previous prediction never come true.</p>

<p>My friend doing super computing just had all of their deadlines moved up at oak ridge to finish what he was working on. </p>

<p>From my prospective, something is up. I don&#39;t know what it is, but it would seem something relatively large.

<p>Also realize power is relative. Someone will have power, and someone will have power regardless... you hear the term &quot;non-essential&quot;.... there you go. I mean unless you&#39;re talking about just a gigantic ass EMP, then that is a different story. However, I have a hard time believing anyone has the capability to EMP something the size of the United States in a quick swoop. It would take some serious space hardware to do that... and keeping it concentrated through the atmosphere... Impressive it would be, doubtful it exists I am.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This puts me in mind of the thread that appeared in this subreddit about a year ago, a month before hurricane Sandy hit the East coast.  The woman&#39;s husband was in the army and got called into a meeting about an &quot;event&quot; happening that would &quot;put much of the east coast under water&quot;, or something like that.  I used to have it bookmarked on my phone, but that phone shit the bed, and I don&#39;t have the link anymore.  Does anyone else have it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember how Hurricane Sandy was a reason Obama was re-elected? I remember now how after the storm hit, everyone was praising Obama&#39;s response to it and the undecided voters were suddenly supporting Obama because of it. Just the timing of it and that past article made me think about the media surrounding Obama&#39;s reaction, and how it seemed to edge him in front of the election race. Not sure how much weight this holds, but it&#39;s something you gotta wonder about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sort of. The FBI used a JavaScript exploit to take down Freedom Hosting. Nobody with any sense would use JavaScript with Tor. It&#39;s pretty well known how many security flaws there are with JavaScript. There are zero-day attacks at least once a year on it. Pedophiles were the only ones dumb enough to use JavaScript while trying to remain anonymous. The Silk Road appears to be uncompromised still, which suggests Tor as a whole is too as long as you keep JavaScript blocked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but I still don&#39;t think the FBI cracked Tor. In fact, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re anywhere near doing that. Have you read how sloppy DPR was? Here&#39;s a good summary: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1nl7p9/sr_shutdown_fallout_discussion/ccjlwgp">http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1nl7p9/sr_shutdown_fallout_discussion/ccjlwgp</a></p>

<p>If anything, I think this shutdown shows just how secure Tor must be. It took the FBI 3 years to catch someone who was this fucking stupid. Imagine if the Silk Road was run by someone that knew what they were doing. He didn&#39;t do any web admin work behind Tor. He did it all on a VPN at a coffeeshop right next to his house. He ordered fake IDs to his house, which got seized. He made a post on a forum on the public Internet saying how he found this site that&#39;s like Amazon for drugs SIX DAYS AFTER HE LAUNCHED IT. He registered for this forum with his personal email address. He mentioned in an unencrypted chat message on the Silk Road that he was in PST. He had an account on StackExchange that used his real name. He changed his username 30 seconds before making a post to ask a question about how to administer hidden services. Why wouldn&#39;t you use a new account for something like that? He narrowed the search for the feds by an order of magnitude with that move. It seems like nothing, but that&#39;s a big deal. It blows my mind that someone could be this careless. </p>

<p>Also, this assassination nonsense sounds like someone managed to hack the Silk Road&#39;s servers and get a bunch of identifying information because again, DPR was completely clueless about security. I can&#39;t believe that someone running a $1.2 billion drug market was such an amateur, and I can&#39;t believe he was stupid enough to stay in the States this entire time. This wasn&#39;t a hack or anything like that. They simply investigated the earliest mention of the Silk Road on the public Internet and put the pieces together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been reading lately about nuclear weapons being secretly transferred to the east coast and preparations happening for a major event. Thing is, most of the reports are based off of information from secret sources or from misreading government reports and not understanding how federal procurement operates. What I do know is the country has been prepared for years for something really big -- whoever is pulling the strings and setting up events like 9/11 is NOT done yet. The plan is for global &quot;full spectrum&quot; domination, and it can&#39;t be accomplished as things stand now. Too many people know too much about false flag attacks and neo-con warmongering. So you create a situation where those people can be removed from society. Nothing like a national emergency to give cover. Why do you think NSA is collecting all that information off of social media? To know who you are, what you believe, what you&#39;ll do in an emergency, and whether you&#39;re a threat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good fucking question.  The orders are to come to work tomorrow morning, unpaid, to sign the paperwork and go home indefinitely.  Draft paperwork is already in hand, official paperwork will be emailed around midnight Eastern Time.  Though there is supposedly a three day window, the word is they want everything signed by noon tomorrow Eastern Time.  The words &quot;orderly shutdown&quot; and &quot;keep calm&quot; were used more than once.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So based on this, the furloughs you speak of may be unrelated to the bill the Senate is voting on now. I wonder how many other government furloughs happened today. I attempted a google search, but can&#39;t sift through all the current shutdown mess.  I wonder if they&#39;re hiding something. It just seems like something is going on.

    <div class="md"><p>I dare say they are related.  It was made clear that what was happening was attributed to what is currently happening in Washington D.C.</p>

<p>It was mentioned that there was a microscopic chance that the situation would resolve before midnight, however the plan stands that folks would be leaving promptly after signing something tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>EDIT:  The discussion went so far as to speak about the possibility of receiving unemployment after several days (I believe 7 or 8 was the number used).</p>

<p>We will certainly know tomorrow, won&#39;t we?</p>

<p>Yeah.  I certainly don&#39;t mean to sound too alarmist, cuz I don&#39;t feel that way, but it <em>does</em> sound like some serious shit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but I think it might be some slightly serious shit. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your description sounded quite a bit more than &quot;slightly&quot; serious though.  I&#39;m not saying we need to go crazy if it IS serious shit - cuz we most certainly <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> go &quot;crazy&quot; - but it <em>does</em> sound serious.</p>

<p>Yeah.  I imagine it isn&#39;t much consolation for the person losing their job at all.  However - and I don&#39;t mean to sound crass saying this or mean <em>any</em> offense, but - it <em>is</em> actually a bit of a relief to find out that &quot;this has happened 17 or so times since the 1970&#39;s&quot; and we&#39;re all still here, you know?  In other words, would I want that many people losing their jobs to mean that:</p>

<p>A) They are now unemployed &quot;just because&quot; (government cutbacks, scaling down, etc) and will simply have to find work elsewhere?</p>

<p>or that </p>

<p>B)  They are now unemployed because some possibly <em>majorly</em> catastrophic shit is about to happen to the East Coast?</p>

<p>No offense, of course, but I would much rather have A than B.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think they can be legally paid by the government at this point, and it seems that someone had a clearer picture of that before they did.  I&#39;m told I&#39;m good until my contract expires, though I can&#39;t imagine what I&#39;ll be doing with so many pieces of the puzzle removed.  I&#39;m sure many of them will attempt to find work elsewhere if this continues for more than a week or two.  Some are most definitely pissed off.  Given all of this, choice &quot;A&quot; seems to be the most likely answer.</p>

<p>I have no knowledge that anything catastrophic will happen on the East Coast.  I&#39;ve heard about FEMA Region III being under some sort of alert, though I&#39;m unsure about the particular reason.  The talking heads in D.C. seemed really fucking stressed out tonight, though I don&#39;t normally watch television so that could just be normal operations in brainwash-land.  That said, I&#39;m glad I&#39;m nowhere near the East Coast right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Former World Bank Senior Counsel for the World Bank Legal Department Karen Hudes also agreed, in an interview with this writer last week, that, based on her direct experience, the Western financial system was run by high level racketeers. According to her, when the Federal Reserve Board refused earlier this year to return 300 tons of gold Germany had entrusted with them, she advised the Germans this was similar to a declaration of war. The Germans appeared to have agreed and recently sent a shot across the bows to the Americans in the form of German helicopters flying so low over the US consulate in Frankfurt that china was rattled off the shelves.</p>

<p>Hudes also independently confirmed that top level cabalists were indeed trying to start World War 3.</p>

<p>To prevent this, Hudes says that <em>380,000 American, Russian and Chinese troops are preparing to move into Washington D.C. in October to arrest the criminals pretending to be a government there</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m seriously wondering if something is up. If the government shutdown occurs (by the time you read this it will probably either have been averted or not), then it could be that they are testing the waters to see how far they can push the American people -- if my theory that this is all just political theater and both sides are sick of being ignored and looking incompetent (lowest government approval rating in years).</p>

<p>The problem is that our economy cannot afford a shutdown of the government for any length of time, and this is going to cause economic collapse. I&#39;m not the first one to think this, a lot of economists on both the right and left are saying that a government shutdown would spin the U.S. economy out of control.</p>

<p>Whether or not this is all engineered is beyond me, nor do I care. Something is up, shit could get real very soon if the government does shut down and it goes longer than a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>I think what your uncle is getting at is that in general, the DoD is expecting shit to go south and are preparing for that to happen in the event of a government shutdown. Whether or not it happens is anyone&#39;s guess.</p>

<p>Also, if this is real and your uncle is who you say he is and has access to clearance stuff, you could have just fucked him over unintentionally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the wall broken up a little:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, my uncle works for the Department of Defense, </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what his job title is or exactly what he does. </p>

<p>He has been with the D.O.D. for a while now (over 15 years) and was also a high ranked officer in the Marines for years before he started with the D.O.D. Anyways, he came in town from Atlanta this weekend to visit and was acting extremely odd the whole time he was around my family. The whole time he was home he seemed to be preoccupied, not very talkative, and just acting strange in general. </p>

<p>Last night before he went back to Atlanta he sat down with my grandparents, cousins and other uncles and said some offbeat shit that really made me feel uncomfortable and scared. He told us all he needed to talk to us, (I was thinking he was going to tell us he was getting remarried because he has been getting pretty serious with a woman he has been dating.) He told us that within the next month there is a high chance that things are going to &quot;get ugly&quot; on the east coast (where we all live). He said he wasn&#39;t sure what is happening or what is going to happen. He said that within the next 2-3 weeks he is being relocated to Virginia Beach from Atlanta because it is possible that they will need some help in that area. I asked him if they thought we were going to be attacked or if it was an economic issue or what? He told me that he truly did not know, but the people in his &quot;department&quot; had been warned of &quot;citizen uprisings&quot; and possible &quot;domestic and/or non-domestic disputes&quot; and that many of the D.O.D. officials with high levels military experience were being moved to port areas along the east coast. </p>

<p>I was asking him every question I could think of and he really had no answers for me and seemed to be in the dark besides what I have already shared with you. I also asked him that if this were an event of any significance then what type of plan should we have and where should we go? He said, that if any significant attack or uprising really did happen that everything would be locked down, but with all the emphasis that the D.O.D. is putting on the east coast the he would definetly head West if anything were to happen and travel was allowed. </p>

<p>I am normally a pretty skeptical person and do not believe everything I hear without some sort of proof or documentation to back it up, but this is seriously freaking me out as it came from a family members mouth and he was serious as a heart attack when he told my family. </p>

<p>Does anyone have any idea about what this could be over? (the possibilities are endless, i know) I apoligize in advance for not having any sort of proof to back this up, b/c I know most people in this subreddit are skeptics just as I am. I really do not want to put my uncle at any risk for anything he has said.. Plus I am not sure how to prove a conversation. If anyone has any possible information or insight on what this could be over, please share.</p>

<p>Or if anyone has seen or heard anything out of the norm on the east coast in the past month please share. I am freaking the fuck out over this and trying to make some sense of it. I realize that this could be some sort of preparedness drill, and that nothing may happen at all and that is what I am hoping, </p>

<p>but any info is appreciated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True however with the 2 other comets coming into play strange magnetic pulls are possible. Look at comet Ellenin.  My thought is this. The grid shut down drills correlate pretty close in timing when all three are in our solar system. Perhaps some strange cellestial event could be used as a false flag ? If the grids did go down naturaly, due to solar flare, or man made disaster things would go downhill pretty quickly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well since I have experience in Virginia Beach this kind of doesn’t make sense. Virginia  Beach area has like 7 military bases and I would say that 80% of the residents are related to someone in the military. So that being said If something were to go down and it was &quot;citizen uprisings&quot; then that says to me its Military rising against itself, as most of the citizens in this area are military. </p>

<p>I think if this is true “Virginia Beach” may be code for somewhere else… hopefully not 3 hours north.</p>

We all  remember what happened when that meteor went over Russia, I can&#39;t remember how big it was, but it&#39;s arrival coincided with <a href="http://earthsky.org/space/asteroid-2012-da14-will-pass-very-close-to-earth-in-2013">DA14</a> quite serindipidously if you recall. These two asteroids are pretty big and one of them coming on the 5th Oct makes its closest approach <strong>SU24 2013</strong> @ 5 (LD) = .0132 something like 1,194,500 miles or 1,922,000 Km = .0132 (AU), and one on the 7th Oct <strong>SC21</strong> 2013 @ 8.8 (LD) 2,102,320 miles 3,382,720 Km= 0.0227 (AU). From these recent events and NASA recently shut down its outward looking space radar or <a href="http://rt.com/usa/space-fence-shut-down-455/">Space Fence</a> seems like a plausible theory to me, whataya think?

<p>That whole area has been a hot bed of speculation the last few weeks on all the forums, something about FEMA section #3 and I guess it goes hot starting tomorrow. Not really buying into it, no offense but, the last few yrs. have been loaded with uncle threads and not one of them has held up. But still a sucker for them though, thanks. </p>

Obviously he wanted to warn you, but if he literally knew no details as you say, it seems to me that by talking to your family he is only raising unfounded fears/putting his job at risk for some sort of confidentiality breach.  But did he just tell you be prepared to move west... just in case?  I just struggle to follow the motivation of your uncle, especially to react so adversely to apparently such little evidence.  I like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, and if this is serious and not a joke, I would say don&#39;t worry.

    <div class="md"><p>When the government lays people off in a situation like this, it is called a furlough. Sorry, but it is what it is. They are not laid off because technically they are still Federal employees, they just aren&#39;t getting paid. Your uncle works for the DOD, so there&#39;s a 50% chance he&#39;ll be furloughed. Because he isn&#39;t in some operation situation, it&#39;s actually more likely. So give him a call. He&#39;s probably at a bar somewhere, drinking his problems away. </p>

<p>I mean, part of the DOD&#39;s pidgin is predicting how politics shake out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that the most likely possibility is a nuke false flag attack on the East Coast. This will provide the reason for an attack on Syria/Iran, and stimulate the US economy. The stimulus has been sucked up by the Banksters and the economy is dead in the water. The Fed can&#39;t taper. There is no industry left. They are trying to reinflate the housing market, but they are not having much luck with it. The only thing left is the only thing that they know how to do, which is wage war. They also want what oil is left in the ME. It might be something little like an electrical grid shut-down, but to really scare the sheeple, a nuke would do the trick! I can almost hear the TV talking heads calling for all true American boys to sign up to fight in Iran to save the US from Islamic aggression.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What an interesting thread! I live in virginia beach. My parents are both DoD employees. I work for the enemy MSM ;) and my boyfriend is in a Navy helicopter squadron. 
My mother was sent home from work yesterday as she is a non-essential civilian. My father&#39;s work will continue. Neither was warned of any uprisings or anything other than the fact that they won&#39;t be paid. My boyfriend is active-duty and has been at work. No suspicious helicopter movements around here. They&#39;re always flying around. However, many squadrons are prepping to replace those that are already deployed AND prepping for winter so there&#39;s a little more activity but nothing is say is out of the ordinary. 
I guess since I work for the MSM though, everyone assumes government puppet strings are controlling me anyway. But really, it&#39;s not like that at all. </p>

This is a new comet that has never been into the inner solar system so it is caring a large negative charge, when it comes into the positively charged environment of the sun it should really brighten up, we pass through the comet debris tail in January, but nothing bad will happen, just a really good show and confirmation for the electrical aspects of comets. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Virginia Beach? Ahg....I live in Hampton. Can&#39;t really see what the problem in this area would be, though. Aside from Langley AFB there isn&#39;t much here.</p>

<p>Edit: And the Norfolk Naval Weapons Station etc. But still, I wouldn&#39;t see these as what I would call high value targets to potential terrorists out there. We didn&#39;t get targeted during 9/11.</p>

<p>Edit 2: If this potentially has something to do with the gov. shutdown, I sincerely doubt anything will come of it. Either they will fix it fast or the workers will just sit on their asses and do nothing (except now they won&#39;t get paid for it).</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cfvxw/time_will_tell_whether_this_is_true_or_not_but_i/">This story, like many before it, is totally bullshit.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/16t0ah/i_work_on_an_ambulance_occasionally_read/">At least a year ago /r/conspiracy actually took selfposts with a grain of salt, even though that story was more convincing than this bullshit.</a></p>

<p>keep in mind I only looked for 5 minutes through old posts here, there is definitetly going to be hundreds more threads about predictions based upon very vague information from an anonymous internet poster who heard it from their distant family member</p>
