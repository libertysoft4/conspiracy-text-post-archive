<p>Those two things don&#39;t necessarily contradict each other and I don&#39;t really understand the point you&#39;re trying to make. I&#39;m just saying that if I was the CIA and I wanted to spread misinformation, I would spread it on sites such as this, because it&#39;s cheap and effective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whenever I read things that ask questions such as these, I think back to a company I worked for several years ago.</p>

<p>In very short, the owner had some great tooling technology that literally the entire world wanted. The company went from ~900K per year in sales to over 40 million.</p>

<p>800 people either working or contracting for the company. Three mom-and-pop shops planned and began multimillion dollar expansions. International travel, Big Names: Busch, Coors, to name a few. We were all riding high, feeling very secure.</p>

<p>Owner sells to bigger company, retires at 34, 800 people out of a job and three companies down the drain because they had no work to recoup their investment on the expansions.</p>

<p>If one man in one city with one company can fool that many people into thinking that he was going to help us all retire, I can&#39;t even begin to try to imagine what a large org like the Gov&#39;t. and Lobbyists could be capable of.</p>

<p>When I saw the &#39;theory&#39; that there were actors at the Boston bombing pretending to be injured, I knew it had to be a plant, because crazy people wouldn&#39;t be able to come up with something that deliberately offensive to so many people. It is, however, a fantastic way to convince people that this entire subreddit is a clusterfuck of lunatics and that the mainstream media is the only reliable source of information after all.</p>

<p>Please explain to me how this man was alive after a traumatic injury as the one he supposedly &quot;just went through&quot;--the author of the article seems to have vast experience in the field and disseminates the phony story used in Boston frame-by-frame.</p>

<p>So...we know that, for sure, at least <em>one</em> actor was used in Boston. When using one...why not more?</p>

<p>Please think about this a bit more critically.  Dismissing something so obvious out-of-hand is dangerous for everybody involved. Just because YOU don&#39;t like the fact that actors were used does NOT invalidate the <em>fact</em> that they were.</p>

<p>Yes, this appears to me to be what is happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The dumb fuckin meme&#39;s that somehow reach the top everyday make me suspicious. As well as the badcop bullshit (divide and conquer at its finest). Add the fact that any post that genuinely touches on the real conspiracy is downvoted seconds after it gets posted and umm yeah.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing that makes me suspect something like this might exist is the persistence of the &quot;planted explosives&quot; theory about 9-11. It is completely absurd, yet it won&#39;t go away. Why? Who keeps sustaining this nutty theory? Is it because they wish to distract attention away from the Saudis and the Israelis? This theory has made any intelligent discussion of 9-11 impossible. The minute you bring up 9-11, here comes the crazies with their planted explosives lunacy, and that&#39;s the end of the discussion. Maybe that&#39;s why this nutty theory is being sustained on the Internet -- to make any other discussion about 9-11 impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? How so?</p>

<p>I saw them on an Israeli talk show (not all of them--I believe it was Silvan Kurtzberg and another guy but the others were in the audience) where they say, in plain Hebrew, that the purpose of them being in the park in NJ was to &quot;document the event.&quot; And this they did--with cameras rolling <em>BEFORE</em> the first plane struck.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget the van <strong>packed with explosives</strong> found near the GW Bridge ALSO connected to the Israeli cut-out Urban Moving Systems and driven by Israelis. It was quickly buried in the MSM, of course, but you can look it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You see this a lot with 9-11 conspiracies.  The theories range from &quot;people in the government knew an attack was imminent and were complicit in it happening to get us into war&quot; to &quot;There weren&#39;t any planes.  They were holograms.&quot;  Because of this people in the prior are lumped in with people in the latter making it all equal bullshit.</p>
