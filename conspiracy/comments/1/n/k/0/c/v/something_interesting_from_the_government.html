        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">214</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-10-02 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Start_button.html">Start_button</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>OK, I was doing some research on some of the stuff that is currently going on and being theorized about right now on the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=east+coast&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=month">east coast</a>. Nothing really jumped out at me as being ZOMG!!! However, on one article i was reading from some rando website I saw something about a government contract so decided to go take a look at what had been posted recently. This is where things get really interesting.</p>

<p>I went to the <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">FBO</a> site as its the public website for the government to post contracts that are open for public companies to apply for. There are also special notices and other things on it as well. The first thing I stumbled across was a contract from <del>FEMA</del> DHS for<a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=4f892ea714c7e9633aadb677d78ff616&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0"> slug shotgun rounds</a>. Not for one office or two offices or even a whole state of offices, but for all of their offices including offices outside the US. Mildly interesting considering they bought a couple billion rounds of hollow point ammo several months back. </p>

<p>I then decided to do a search nation wide for anything that FEMA had posted in the last 14 days. FUCK ME! </p>

<p>There are approximately 30 items posted by FEMA alone in the last 2 weeks. SOme things are pretty ordinary for most any large entity. Toner, office supplies, IT services, things like that. However, some of the items are down right insane. One contract is for <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=77f28aa5075b0ad61523033ea9322069&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">6 sets of 13 trailer mounted diesel power generators</a>. Each set of generators has to have 1 100Kw gen, 6 60Kw gen, 6 40Kw gen, and 6 power distribution panels with 300 feet of power cable per detachment. It even has the MERS title in the fucking title of the proposal. The funniest part about this particular contract though is that the location given as the &quot;Place for Performance&quot; is what appears to be a local FEMA office in Bothell, Wa. But, the agent listed as the point of contact has a Virginia area code (540) and the company that was awarded the contract is also in Virginia. </p>

<p>Another one is for <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=dfd15fd2e58967fd95ccfd6789b0871c&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">shelter support kits of bulk hygiene</a>. For the uninitiated, that would be bulk hygiene supplies capable of being distributed in bulk (pallets). Why would FEMA need personal hygiene supplies, let alone in bulk. They don&#39;t have any large camps anymore, do they? There hasn&#39;t been an event where they had to supply hundreds of thousands of people with personal hygiene supplies since Katrina. Hygiene supplies don&#39;t go bad, so they can&#39;t be replacing anything they have had in storage, that means they needed more than what they already have stored up. But why would they need more? Just in case your wondering, there is no &quot;Place for Performance&quot; location listed on this one...</p>

<p>The next contract was for blankets. How many blankets you might ask? About <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=01c40e7532d85d20e5b99321f2b0de0d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">$46 million worth of blankets</a> to be exact. What would FEMA need with $46 million worth of 100% cotton blankets? They don&#39;t have any camps anymore, blankets don&#39;t go bad sitting inside plastic bags inside of a warehouse. </p>

<p>There are a couple of contracts for $3.2 <del>billion</del> million worth of <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=8163e47aaab8abcdfe86fa0a78236154&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">misc. shelter supplies</a> and $2.8 <del>billion</del> million worth of <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=2d2338f6df23f8d843dae86d0ee8f9a3&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">shelter cleaning supplies</a>. The interesting parts of these contracts is that they are to be delivered anywhere in the world. That&#39;s right, anywhere. It says in the paperwork that delivery will be anywhere inside the continental US or outside the continental US that the person in charge deems appropriate. It also listed several distribution centers across the US and its territories that would also be delivery locations.</p>

<p>So, after seeing all of these and reading some pretty crazy things I came across two of the contracts that were the most benign yet obviously ominous contracts of them all. One was for a <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=111d31201445599606625a9c1417e51e&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">21st century JFO</a>, or Joint Field Operations site and the other was for <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=c49bb99b90d7a95bcab8a2e2b298ee38&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">Mobile Command &amp; Control Containers</a>, and with the mobile comand &amp; control containers, the contractor had to pick up generators capable of running these from one of three FEMA owned distribution centers listed in the contract. These containers had to include 16 workstations with 4 electrical outlets and two network drops at eachstation. A 25&#39; tall, hand cranked antenna mast, a 4u network rack, a place for printers scanners and copiers, outdoor lighting, collapsible workstations at the rear of the container to accommodate the ability of forklifts to be able to drive into the container and place pallets of stuff inside, and floor hooks to strap said pallets down during shipping. Did I mention that the container were to be built on top of a 53&#39; drop deck trailer, and attached to the trailer so that it wouldn&#39;t shift during transport.</p>

<p>The JFO delivery location was &quot;to be decided&quot;, however the mobile command and control containers were to be delivered to a logistics facility in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=11601+PITTSBURGH+PLATE+GLASS+RD+SE++CUMBERLAND%2C++MD&amp;data=!1m4!1m3!1d1826!2d-78.7452854!3d39.5911424!2m1!1e3!4m10!1m9!4m8!1m3!1d14595!2d-78.7585212!3d39.6357722!3m2!1i1280!2i912!4f13.1&amp;fid=7">Cumberland, MD</a>. Now, that&#39;s interesting for several reasons. One, there is no limit on where the the contractor could be located, so technically, these could be built in California, and then the contractor would have to figure out how to get them to Cumberland. Second, why would FEMA have them delivered to this logistics facility and not just shipped where they want them? Maybe they don&#39;t want anyone in the general public to know where they are going? There are a large quantity of other trailer (mobile home) looking things at this facility already. </p>

<p>There are some other items on the FBO site that are pretty interesting, and I just read a few from the FEMA section. Imagine what&#39;s lurking under the DOE or some of the other &quot;Departments&quot;...</p>

<p>:::Edit:::
I fixed the dollar values on the shelter kits thank to <a href="/u/Cartesian_Doubt">/u/Cartesian_Doubt</a>. I also correct the shotgun slug to DHS as the purchaser as opposed to FEMA, as DHS is the agency listed on the contract. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Too late now. OCT 1st is over. Typically to slide in under the budget, the deliveries have to be completed by the deadline. However, perhaps this could explain the initial recklessness one could expect from the start of a brand new shiny budget. The weird part is that the &#39;government&#39; is &#39;shut down&#39;, so i would assume the people that are in charge of dishing out/confirming/securing the new budget wouldn&#39;t be working right now. Well, lets just close the museums instead, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually it looks like getting ready for the new fiscal year&#39;s buys.  Requirements are posted on FBO (FedBizOps) 15-30 days prior to releasing Requests for Proposals or Requests for Quotes.  Pretty common.

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, FEMA already has 6 fully stocked distribution centers across the US, PR, and Guam. There is one in Texas, Georgia, Hawaii, and California. These are not you mom&#39;s public storage, these are huge. Huge as in, the one in Atlanta is almost half a million square feet in size. The one in Fort Worth isn&#39;t in one building or even two buildings, it takes up and entire industrial complex including 9 warehouses, 1 office style building, numerous outbuildings and 67 solar panels.</p>

<p>I guess my point here is why does FEMA need more blankets, shelter cleaning supplies, and bulk hygiene items that can be delivered anywhere in the world at the boss&#39; discretion or why they need almost a million dollars worth of trailer mounted diesel generators delivered supposedly to a FEMA office in Washington state but the point of contact is an agent based in Virginia, and so is the company fulfilling the order for said power systems. </p>

<p>Why does the Federal Emergency Management Administration need to have contracts on hand <em>that state that a condition of delivery might be that it needs to be delivered outside of the United States</em>?</p>

<p>Why does DHS need a couple billion hollow point rounds and a few hundred thousand sporting rifles? You know, the very same gun they don&#39;t want the American public to have. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s think about this for a second. If you want to take control of a population, you don&#39;t do it at gunpoint. You make them want to give you control. So you get 9/11. The American people throw our civil rights at the government and say &quot;Here, take this and go kill the bad people that did this&quot;. Now, a few years later, your plot to take over the population is starting to take shape, a recession here, an economic increase there, keep people watching their own bank accounts and not yours. Then, when you think you are just about ready to initiate your plan, you see this sector of the populace that is better armed than you. Well that certainly won&#39;t do. What would make people want to turn their guns in, or at least enough of them to get a law passed to make it illegal to own, posses, or purchase a gun bigger and badder than yours. I know, kids. Let&#39;s kill some kids, blame it on some troubled kid, and then blame these mean scary looking guns. People will once again start throwing their civil rights, and their guns, at you and say &quot;here, take this and stop this from ever happening again&quot;. </p>

<p>Now, you have an unarmed population that relies on you for safety, security, food, insurance, social welfare, banking, housing, jobs, and just about everything else they need to survive. What do you do then? Well, there is no one with a bigger gun than you so you don&#39;t have to worry about an uprising, besides, most of the population doesn&#39;t have the balls to not do what they are told. The sheeple will follow orders just like they were trained their whole lives to do. Go here, do this, buy that. What did you think was happening, a free market place? You were being trained to do what you were told. </p>

<p>So, we have guns and power, but we also have a lot of responsibility, which sucks. What to do, what to do...</p>

<p>I got it, we will start shutting things down. Slowly but surely, we take away their food, their jobs, their security, and they will beg us to come back and give it back to them.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t anyone else see that the government is fucking us in the ass without even the god damn courtesy of a fucking reach around? </p>

<p>WAKE THE FUCK UP!!!</p>

<p>The RFP that I looked at said that the contractor shall be able to deliver to any point in the continental United States (including Alaska) or to any port in the continental United States specified by FEMA for delivery outside the continental United States &quot;Any location outside of the continental United States that is a United States Territory to be determined at the time of order&quot;.</p>

<p>So all that is saying is that FEMA will be responsible for delivering it Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree. I live in Hawaii and a lot of us are questioning radiation poisoning. My family has medical conditions that Dr&#39;s cannot explain. Blood in stool and urine, coughing up  blood, no nose bleeds, sinus problems, respiratory problems, frequent chills that leave you imobile, or hot flashes, no fevers, body aches, not flu, so tired and depressed, random thyroid problems, stroke like symptoms,diarrhea for weeks, extremely low white blood cell count, etc. For years now. Not normal at all. We are healthy people. Never having these issues. The illness tends to come in waves covering the island with similar medical conditions. </p>

I used to live on the big island and had weird symptoms. Not as bad as you describe, but weird.  I think it has something to do with the food supply as well as the petri-dish climate.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes Big Island. Most symptoms come and go like the internal bleeding, chills, hotflashes, diarrhea, sinus infections. A lot of symptoms seem more constant. My Mother in law was in the hospital last week with stroke like symptoms and internal bleeding. My father in law just got back from a urologist for internal bleeding and severe chills to where he couldn&#39;t move just shake. No answers from DR&#39;s just take these antibiotics you will be fine. And yes GMO testing is so extremely prevelant on all islands now.

<p>Avoid all fish and seafood. Its all contaminated. Get some iodine supplements to combat the radiation aswell, make sure you check the source of it too. its like a wall, it wont cure radiation but it will hold it back from causing damage</p>

<p>A) Any internist worth his salt can recognize radiation poisoning. </p>

<p>B) Acute radiation sickness requires a MASSIVE amount of radiation, more than you would ever, <em>ever</em> receive from eating seafood, unless the fish were made from radium. CT scans dish out radiation on the order of <em>milligrays,</em> while anything beyond constitutional symptoms typically goes unnoticed until 1 Gy or higher. Also, fish aren&#39;t magical lead golems; for eating fish to result in ARS, the only explanation for that fish to be that radioactive and still make it to your table without dying within hours is an actual miracle. </p>

<p>C) ARS is fatal within days to weeks. He&#39;s had these symptoms for years. </p>

<p>thats 3 times now ive pointed this out, and even made it bold incase your eye sight is failing. would you like me to break it down for you even more, since clearly it wasnt simple enough for you to comprehend the first 2?</p>

<p>And while were on the subject</p>

<p>&quot;Iodine is also used to for radiation emergencies, to protect the thyroid gland against radioactive iodides. Potassium iodide tablets for use in a radiation emergency are available as FDA-approved products (ThyroShield, Iosat) and on the Internet as food supplements. Potassium iodide should only be used in a radiation emergency, not in advance of an emergency to prevent sickness.&quot;</p>

<p>oooh well that explains it. you blew 10s of thousands of dollars on a peice of paper called a degree and you hail your self superior XD, hahaha. Sorry chump, hate to burst your bubble, but the fact you have to brandish this to give you legitimacy tells me youre actually a quack.</p>

<p>So lets lay this out</p>

<p>i claim to not be a doctor or have medical training<br/>
i link to information for the reader<br/>
i suggest an element thats known to help with the subject at hand   </p>

<p>but you still for some reason, cant get this past your skull and continually repeat the same 3 lines over and over again when they dont even apply and if they do, i already addressed. and even go as far saying im <em>wrong</em> when every bit of literature backs me up. Textbook definition insane.</p>

<p>So, i give you the floor for the last word. and please do better than &quot;you have no authority blah blah blah&quot;. a smart guy such as yourself should be able to pump out more than 3 ideas at a time. The floor is yours, make it good!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes thank you for the information. It seems like low dose poisoning. We do not have rashes or nose bleeds. But a lot of people have strangely similar illness at the same times. We do take iodine in seaweed not harvested here or japan and zeolite suppliments. A lot of people here talk about it. Just 6 months after Fukushima our milk and cattle already tested abnormal rates of radiation. I do follow wind and current maps also. We have almost cut seafood out of our diets. No local beef or dairy. I realy try not to live my life in fear or project it. Something is strange though. The doctors do not have answers just antibiotics. I&#39;m not sure if they know the answers either. But if it came out that folks were victims of radiation poisoning the tourism industry would not exist. </p>

<p>Second, why would FEMA have them delivered to this logistics facility and not just shipped where they want them? </p>

<p>Because its a logistics facility which exists entirely to distribute disaster equipment and supplies where necessary?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that&#39;s not what this facility does. This particular facility is not used to store emergency aid materials to be sent somewhere. That&#39;s what the distribution centers do. This is literally just a warehouse that&#39;s somewhat close to a major train yard. The aerial photos I&#39;ve seen of the building show that there are some old train tracks on the property and some new spur lines are being constructed in the area. </p>

<p>There is also a small coal power plant just across the street from the logistics facility. </p>

<p>The main things you want for a logistics facility are easy access to major interstates and or train tracks right up to the front door. This facility has neither. There is no evidence that anything that is stored at this facility, if anything is stored inside the building at all, could be deployed rapidly enough to aid anything, let alone a major emergency event. There is one road to this building, which means that any large amount of vehicles that were to converge on the location would have immediate traffic access issues. The road into the area would be clogged with commercial trucks and civilian vehicles, which eliminates shopping supplies out. There doesn&#39;t appear to be any places to land anything larger than a helicopter on site, so that eliminates the air. </p>

<p>What are we left with? Underground transit or water transit. We can clearly see there is nothing more than a ditch in front of the building and wooded areas around the other three sides. So that eliminates water. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think your findings are suspicious. Two weeks ago, 20,000 homes were destroyed in Colorado.</p>

<p>1) The shotgun shell site states &quot;indefinite quantity&quot;, so they&#39;ll likely order whatever they use. They specifically mention an annual use of around 4 million rounds a year. Even though this is a lot, I have no understanding of how much they use normally, including training and whatnot. Also, they don&#39;t mention offices outside of the US, but outside of the continental US(&quot;CONUS&quot;). This is most likely a reference to places like Hawaii and Puerto Rico. </p>

<p>2) Their old diesel generators probably died and they bought new ones. Or maybe they want to expand their power generation capabilities. They location of the agent in charge is also no indication, government tends to be inefficient like that.</p>

<p>3) Hygiene supplies do go bad. Google it. The gov&#39;t often has to throw &quot;good&quot; things away because they are past their legal expiration date. I would expect FEMA to have stored huge amounts of such supplies, so some going bad is no indication of anything. Also, the site mentions a sum between $500 and $4 million, so they are not buying a lot. </p>

<p>4) Blankets can be destroyed by moths, or when they get wet. 100% wool blankets are probably heavily affected by this, or at least much more so than synthetic ones. A large replacement every other year is not suspicious.</p>

<p>5) Shelter supplies (presumably) go bad, too. Also, the contracts are awarded for an amount between $500 and ~$3 billion. It is unreasonable to assume the maximum amount here.</p>

<p>6)They bought new mobile command centers to help them organize their crisis responses. This is not suspicious at all. They seem to have struggled with coordination in past disasters. Why do you list the number of electrical outlets and other minor details? Electrical outlets seem like a reasonable, non-conspiracy thing to have. I don&#39;t understand your suspicions about the delivery as well. According to your post, they ship the new trailers to the place where they already keep most of their other trailers. This might well be part of organizational scheme. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>One, there is no limit on where the the contractor could be located, so technically, these could be built in California, and then the contractor would have to figure out how to get them to Cumberland.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, this is very reasonable. They just want their trailers and don&#39;t care where they come from. I doubt that the contractor is going to spend a lot of time figuring out how to move the trailer, though. </p>

<p>7) Yes, just imagine whats lurking under the DOE. This is precisely the kind of thing I hate about conspiracies. What are you implying? You could have looked it up. But you didn&#39;t and choose to ignore the facts. I did look it up. Nothing is lurking under the DOE. They want some valves and new roofs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive dealt with some of these bulk goods before- distribution after emergencies, that sort of thing. They have a finite shelf life or run low. They&#39;re typically deployed after tornado outbreaks, big floods, ect. Hygiene is a big deal when there is a water shortage. After Ike and Rita, I had water to drink but was living on purel showers and ghetto laundering- mixing some water, some soap and/or purel with dirty clothes in a heavy trash bag.</p>

<p>The ammo is of note after such massive, across the board expenditures on ammo that the FCC, NOAA, and other Fed departments got ammo and guns (Department of Education, IRS got shotguns, FBI got 20mm cannons, ect)</p>

<p>Hollowpoints by nature cant be used by the military so thats going to be Federal departments using them. They&#39;re meant to minimize overpenetration through walls and flesh in close situations by dumping all their energy in the target- which tells you how they intend to use them.</p>

<p>Shotgun rifled slugs are useful for two things- extending the effective range of a shotgun (with rifle, reflex or ghost ring sights) well past 100 yards to give it a limited rifle capability. The second is for defeating up to class 3A bodyarmor (and giving even the wearers of heavoer armor a bad day. At close range, deer slugs are also good for cracking some vehicle engine blocks.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever done government contracting or contracting for any organization large enough to have departmental budgets, you&#39;ll find it&#39;s common for them to write up a contract that promises you money in the last weeks of their fiscal year. The money doesn&#39;t have to change hands, the nature of the order may change, sometimes you just get to keep the money for doing nothing.</p>

<p>The important thing is that the organization ends their year with enough contractual obligations to deplete their budget.</p>

<p>However, some of the items are down right insane. One contract is for 6 sets of 13 trailer mounted diesel power generators. Each set of generators has to have 1 100Kw gen, 6 60Kw gen, 6 40Kw gen, and 6 power distribution panels with 300 feet of power cable per detachment. It even has the MERS title in the fucking title of the proposal. The funniest part about this particular contract though is that the location given as the &quot;Place for Performance&quot; is what appears to be a local FEMA office in Bothell, Wa. But, the agent listed as the point of contact has a Virginia area code (540) and the company that was awarded the contract is also in Virginia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t understand what you think is &quot;insane&quot; about this or why you think that having a point of contact in Virginia is unusual. If you read the Statement of Work PDF, the deliveries are to 6 different locations across the United States, including Washington State, Maryland, Massachusetts, Texas, Georgia, and Colorado.</p>

<p>Backup power generators seem to me like <em>exactly</em> the type of thing FEMA should have on hand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another one is for <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;amp;mode=form&amp;amp;id=dfd15fd2e58967fd95ccfd6789b0871c&amp;amp;tab=core&amp;amp;_cview=1">shelter support kits of bulk hygiene</a>. For the uninitiated, that would be bulk hygiene supplies capable of being distributed in bulk (pallets). Why would FEMA need personal hygiene supplies, let alone in bulk. They don&#39;t have any large camps anymore, do they? There hasn&#39;t been an event where they had to supply hundreds of thousands of people with personal hygiene supplies since Katrina. Hygiene supplies don&#39;t go bad, so they can&#39;t be replacing anything they have had in storage, that means they needed more than what they already have stored up. But why would they need more? Just in case your wondering, there is no &quot;Place for Performance&quot; location listed on this one...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you read the RFP, they want a contract for the option to buy these if they are needed. That&#39;s why there&#39;s no Place for Performance. The contractor would need to be able to deliver at least 50 kits within 48 hours and more within 7 days.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are a couple of contracts for $3.2 billion (that&#39;s billion, with a b) worth of <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;amp;mode=form&amp;amp;id=8163e47aaab8abcdfe86fa0a78236154&amp;amp;tab=core&amp;amp;_cview=1">misc. shelter supplies</a> and $2.8 billion (again, b for billion) worth of <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;amp;mode=form&amp;amp;id=2d2338f6df23f8d843dae86d0ee8f9a3&amp;amp;tab=core&amp;amp;_cview=1">shelter cleaning supplies</a>. The interesting parts of these contracts is that they are to be delivered anywhere in the world. That&#39;s right, anywhere. It says in the paperwork that delivery will be anywhere inside the continental US or outside the continental US that the person in charge deems appropriate. It also listed several distribution centers across the US and its territories that would also be delivery locations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You misread the dollar amounts. It&#39;s million with an m. Also, it says
available for delivery outside the <em>continental</em> United States. It
specifically says &quot;Any location outside of the continental United States
that is a United States Territory to be determined at the time of
order&quot;. The clause is specifying that the contractor is responsible for
delivery to the 49 states of the continental United States, otherwise it
is just responsible for delivery to a port and FEMA will handle the
delivery to Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, etc.</p>

<p>um, this is the case with any goods.  I don&#39;t recall ever seeing a toy production line feeding the shelves at Wal-Mart.  Goods get produced and delivered where they are needed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Second, why would FEMA have them delivered to this logistics facility and not just shipped where they want them?</p>

<p>Possible that a logistics facility is where they want them?  It is a <em>logistics facility</em> after all, and this is FEMA whose mission is <em>Disaster mitigation,</em> <strong>preparedness</strong>, <em>response, recovery, education, and references</em></p>

<p>We bid on contracts all over the South and are based in Louisiana. It&#39;s not uncommon at all. You do not need to be local to win the work. As for the POC being in VA, that is the regional contracting office. Your local FEMA, or any agency, often outs in a request for materials/service and the regional office handles the procurement. </p>

<p>As for FEMA buying 12 gauge slugs, that&#39;s already been discussed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I have to say this isn&#39;t really WTF worthy.  FEMA responds to a LOT of shit.  Take for example all the flooding that has happened recently in Colorado.  FEMA will be there.  They will distribute needed supplies, help file insurance claims and federal assistance claims, etc.</p>

<p>I was working private security at a FEMA site in the summer of 2010 in Lexington, Kentucky.  They were there for the purposes I mentioned above, and they were onsite for months.  Their officers were in the field for months, so obviously supplies were needed for quite a while.  It&#39;s not a quick &quot;we&#39;re in, we&#39;re out&quot; process.</p>

<p>Generators are needed a LOT at field sites, as usually power is sketchy in the aftermath, and just to process shit, they need power to run computers, copiers, workstations, not to mention if they are hosting living quarters that also need power.</p>

<p>Shelter, food, hygiene, warmth (blankets) are pretty much your top survival needs, so to think it &quot;odd&quot; FEMA buying them up is kinda absurd.  I mean, how many ppl that visit this thread look to &quot;prepping&quot; as well?  Those are basically the things we all think would be handy to have in case of an emergency...stands to reason an organization that responds to disaster sites would think this as well.</p>

<p>With the way things are going, it seems like there will be multiple failures in the system across the board.  The fallout will most likely be millions of people rendered homeless/jobless.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s possible that FEMA has no idea and are just being told to prep.  </p>

<p>Things like the Trans-Pacific Partnership come to mind.  </p>

<p>If the reports are correct, the &quot;job creators&quot; are going to create millions of new jobs - in Asia.  That will obviously mean moving jobs from here to there.  </p>

<p>From that job loss, businesses will lose income from their usual customers and cause a chain reaction of bankruptcies down entire supply chains.   </p>

<p>There are millions of empty bank-owned houses and there are going to be millions more.  </p>

<p>Will the government bail out the people this time instead of the banks?  Doubt it.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s all speculation at this point. 
Are they going to step-up the so-call &quot;strategy of tension&quot; with false flag terror or crisis actors?  </p>

<p>Is there going to be massive job-loss from things like TPP? </p>

<p>Is there going to be a major influx of refugees from countries bombed by the US?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets do some math!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DHS bought a couple billion rounds of hollow points</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are 800,000 or so police officers in the United States. Assuming that ONLY police officers use these rounds, thats 2500 rounds per officer. This order is a blanket order with no timeframe, but for the sake of argument we will say that they use every single bullet in one year.</p>

<p>Police officers regularly train in firearms, with an average of around twice a month. If every officer practice every two weeks with hollow points, They&#39;d use about 104 bullets per visit, or roughly 5-8 magazines. That constitutes about an hour of shooting range practice for every officer in the country, every two weeks for about a year--and this is only average in-service practice. They can and do shoot a lot more in their initial training or scheduled exercises.</p>

<p>Take this rough estimation as what you will, but 2 billion bullets is not nearly as much as it sounds like, spread across a million or so officers and potentially many years.</p>

<p>Oh, and regarding training with hollow points: they may possibly use hollow points for training for a number of reasons, but one of the more obvious is &quot;hollow points are more dangerous to have on the streets--if we are using them all to shoot pieces of paper, then less people are using them to shoot cops/people/convenience stores&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rounds are not for local PD&#39;s. They are for Homeland Security officers. And I can tell you for a fact that they do NOT use hollow points for training purposes. Too expensive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The DHS child agencies also include:</p>

<p>Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, TSA, Coast Guard, and the Secret Service, who all probably use a good amount of bullets for training.</p>

<p>And I&#39;d imagine they can get a steep discount on hollow points if they order them by the billion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing wrong with your argument is that TSA isn&#39;t issued firearms, nor are they issued ammunition, and the fact that the Coast Guard uses DOD ammo. So, that leaves ICE/BP, and the secret service. Considering that the Secret Service only has <a href="http://www.secretservice.gov/faq.shtml">4500 agents that carry firearms</a>, we can safely guess that they don&#39;t need a whole lot of that 2 billion rounds. </p>

<p>The border patrol on the other hand does have about 20,000+ armed agents, so that would take a lot of bullets to train. So you may have something there.</p>

<p>There is this one thing called FLETC. It&#39;s the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center and they do the actual training of all the agents of almost a 100 different Federal agencies including, you guessed it, Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Coast Guard, and the Secret Service. FLETC actually has its own contract out there for ammunition. </p>

<p>So we are back to square one with this conversation. The 2 billion rounds of .40 S&amp;W that DHS has contracted for is what is referred to as &quot;duty ammunition&quot; or ammunition to use while on duty or in the line of duty. That&#39;s a lot of bullet&#39;s to use don&#39;t you think. Now granted, they are limited to <strong><em>ONLY</em></strong> 90 million rounds a year, that is still a butt load of ammo to go through.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>a few odd thing here.</p>

<p>first of all, all the downvotes are pretty odd</p>

<p>second, a while back people were saying &quot;Its end of the fiscal year, fema is just spending remaining money&quot; now everyone is like &quot;Its a beginning of a fiscal year, fema is just spending a new budged&quot; and on what? Electricity generators, funking big load of blankets and ammunation. When Power grid outtake training is going to take a place soon. You dont need blankets for 46 million $ and ammunation when you just bought a big load of ammunation before on just a training.</p>

<p>Why does the Federal Emergency Management Administration need to have contracts on hand that state that a condition of delivery might be that it needs to be delivered outside of the United States?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The RFP that I looked at said that the contractor shall be able to deliver to any point in the continental United States (including Alaska) or to any port in the continental United States specified by FEMA for delivery outside the continental United States &quot;Any location outside of the continental United States that is a United States Territory to be determined at the time of order&quot;.</p>

<p>So all that is saying is that FEMA will be responsible for delivering it Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, etc.</p>
