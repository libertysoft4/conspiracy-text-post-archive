    <div class="md"><p>Foreign policy? Nope. Revolt isn&#39;t something you undertake on another&#39;s behalf- it&#39;s a rebellion against the misery of one&#39;s own (and by extension, a group&#39;s) life, and the weight, real or perceived, that the government is bringing down domestically. Unless the US decides to nuke its <em>own</em> cities or round up and massacre its <em>own</em> minorities, then I just don&#39;t know how you&#39;d go about fomenting revolt. It&#39;s too abstract to the average bear- and a revolution needs all the average bears it can get. A revolt based on questionable foreign policy doesn&#39;t seem likely- as we&#39;ve seen since the first Bush administration. And we&#39;ve seen plenty of egregious foreign policy (and arguably, war crimes) in the interval. And let&#39;s not forget the event that <em>should&#39;ve</em>, by any metric, at least provoked widespread rioting- the Kent State massacre. If there was ever a time in US history where the government was actively, openly menacing its own citizens, it was the 60s and 70s. What we got in lieu of revolution was 420 culture, some good music (and an astounding amount of bad music), and a generation with names like Moonbeam and Bodhi. It <em>should</em> have been a watershed moment- but it was lost in the haze.</p>

<p>Food/fuel/water riots? Sure. They happen all over the place. I don&#39;t necessarily know whether it would explode into full-out revolt, but if there&#39;s anything America values, it&#39;s its own comfort and convenience. I don&#39;t believe we&#39;ll see revolution of the scale necessary to change anything until those two things go out the window. Dwindling resources seem like a pretty safe bet for revolution; and while I say it&#39;s down to convenience, survival is a big motivator as well.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to think that a fascist crackdown would make revolution likely; that almost seems like a scenario in which revolution would be damn near necessary. Again, though, if you keep pumping the people full of bread and circuses, it&#39;s going to be hard to get many to regard disappearing rights and crippling laws as reasons to get hot under the collar. We&#39;ve seen some of this during the interminable &quot;War on Terror&quot;- such as the people whose 4- and 5-year-old kids get strip-searched and have no problem with it because it&#39;s for &quot;safety&quot;, or those who argue from the &quot;If you&#39;ve got nothing to hide...&quot; position.</p>

<p>Personally, my stance is this: we&#39;re edging closer to a very stringently controlled, heavily corporate- and money-run society using puppet-shows and double-speak to convince us of our own exceptionalism (to our detriment), and thus far, we seem fine with it. I can&#39;t think of a more hypocritical and illegitimate form of government than that. I feel like we&#39;re headed for a confrontation, likely in the next few decades, but it remains to be seen whether it&#39;s a Second American Revolution or another example of why the Attorney General needs warrantless access to the interiors of our colons immediately, because <em>terrorism</em>. I hope it&#39;s the former, and I hope the aftermath is a sensible and constructive one, but I have my doubts about that. All the government has to do is to keep giving us the convenience and distraction we&#39;re used to, and they&#39;ll end up with carte blanche, sadly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a way, isn&#39;t bad foreign policy a way of &quot;rounding up minorities&quot; in the US? I mean, you don&#39;t exactly see tons of upper class citizens desperately lining up at the recruiters office. It hurts our country and people too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if it&#39;s taking place in the US, it&#39;s domestic policy. It&#39;d be different if the US was rounding up Karen tribes or Hottentots to fight our wars for us. You could make the argument that the US is rounding up its own minorities for the military more effectively if whites were being barred and discouraged, or if minorities were being fast-tracked to middle management status over whites, of course, but I have yet to see evidence that this is the case. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s less a minority issue than it is a class issue at its core; what recruiters dangle out there to attract people impacts the poor rather than minorities specifically- college funds, signing bonuses, re-enlistment bonuses, etc, and they dangle them out in front of anybody who walks through the door, black or white. And while there are a great many poor minorities in the military, there are a great many poor whites, too (source- I&#39;m ex-Navy). The ratio definitely leans in the direction of minorities, but that&#39;s a very, very long-standing societal and social inequity, one with its roots buried deeply in the 15th and 16th centuries onward. It&#39;s not good, but if the government is looking to shove minorities into war as a population-control measure, then they devised that scheme in the 20th century, considering how predominately white the military was all the way through WWII.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question is wrong and needlessly violent.</p>

<p>Americans don&#39;t have to have any armed rebellion they simply have to stop giving legitimacy to the government. It is rather simply explained <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6b70TUbdfs">here</a> and also explored <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNIgztvyU2U&amp;amp;list=UUFeK8ZdHbCqAq3gekWs8aEQ&amp;amp;index=29">here</a>.</p>

<p>Once enough people realize the utter fallacy of believing in government, they will be free. As long as the sociopaths can keep us at each others throats, it will maintain control. Waking up and smelling the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb8Rj5xkDPk&amp;amp;list=UUFeK8ZdHbCqAq3gekWs8aEQ&amp;amp;index=18">reality</a> will be the catalyst for change, no shots need to be fired.</p>

All of my friends, realize, we are footing the bill for our loans, our kids (if we have them), the older people, and we will probably not be able to afford to ecer stop working. We are idiots breed in government schools to not think, not learn teachings but learn how to take tests. We are broke, there are more of us without work than ever before (25 % of 2o-34 year olds are without work.) What the government fails to realize is we are far from dumb. We read, discuss, and realise the issues brought to us by others in power.  And we are starting to get pissed. For one of the least discussed generations, in a positive light, people seem overly comfortable to forget that the same punk kids that were pumped full of medication, taught to fight, brainwashed by big brother, and royally fucked by the government are about to start gaining power in a failed system. With that comes two solutions.</p>

<p>War. Which they would not want. You raised us as fucked up delinquents. We will fight as such.</p>

<p>Or change within government itself. Like I said we realize how broke we are and will continue to be. Our kids will be even worse off... we know the problems and when we can we will fix them.. a lot of people are waking up these days.</p>

<p>I suppose if my friends or neighbors were being rounded up and executed for dissent, then I might in that instance have to arm myself for defensive purposes. I really don&#39;t see that happening though. I&#39;ve not really thought about it much to be honest.</p>

<p>edit: I guess if I were in a situation where i perceived non-violent actions to have no power to prevent harm to those I care about, or where i perceived non-violent actions to have no power to prevent harm to myself, then in that situation I would likely arm myself. But I&#39;m the kind of person who picks bugs up and puts them outside rather than squish them. Violence would be a loooonnng ways down my list of coping strategies for trying situations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am asking the question because I want to bring awareness to the <em>reality</em> of this issue. I was hoping for a good discussion on r/AskReddit. </p>

<p>The US advocates &quot;regime-change&quot; and &quot;military-action&quot; and to the populace those sound like strategies in a game. I want to know what a real world &#39;red line&#39; the Americans give their government. </p>

<p>I am surprised at the hesitance. For example, like you said if the military rounded up and executed 1 out of 10 of your neighbors, that <em>should</em> make armed rebellion justifiable for any moral and sane person. That&#39;s an extreme case, but people are afraid even of discussing that. </p>

<p>Now, here is the philosophical point: If people have become so afraid that they can not verbalize a &#39;red line&#39; without fear of being detained, then can you honestly say you don&#39;t live in a fascist state?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it means necessarily that we live in a fascist or totalitarian state. I think it means that we have a government and associated power structures that are terrified of the potential danger that groups of humans present, including the average citizens like me. I think that&#39;s a sad state of affairs, but it is the reality. We have a government that is even terrified of the threat to the stability of government if 9/11 conspiracy theories became popularly outwardly accepted, regardless of their verity. So with such a hypersensitivity to potential threats, militia groups or domestic terrorists and what have you, I think it&#39;s sensible for us average people to be very clear that we intend no violence. Yes it&#39;s not the ideal utopian free society where you can say whatever you want and not expect consequences, it&#39;s the real world, and in the real world you exercise caution and try not to make yourself scary looking to scared people with guns.</p>

<p>edit: anyway, there are non-violent ways to revolt or rebel that can send a message clearly without anybody becoming physically injured or killed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont care for the fact that hand full of families own the majority of the wealth in this country. The banks are robbing the entire world. Companies like monsanto are going to make planting your own crops illegal. They want to privatize water sources. They stifle medical and technological innovation to ensure their pockets continue to get lined. To top it all off we essential live in a police state. I&#39;m not happy one bit, and its really depressing. I am however not scared. I probably should be, and i fear for my children. The worst part is even if i leave the US, theres no way in hell my ex-wife will let me take my kids, so their stuck here. Shes too busy watching the kardashians and shit to even know about the blindfold pulled over her eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Violence is never justified if the desired result is peace.</p>

<p>I would think that one of the main issues people have with the US Government is it&#39;s addiction to mindless violent domination. An armed rebellion is a violent dominators dream. </p>

<p>Any armed response to the violent domination we see coming from the US Government will be completely fruitless. </p>

<p>When a critical mass of average citizens experiences FIRST HAND the ruthless and monstrous nature of those in control they will resist it by actively denouncing it. Weak and ignorant individuals will attack it or they will declare allegiance to it out of fear.</p>

<p>What needs to happen is a continued growth in the voices of those who stand in peace in full opposition to the policy and actions motivated by violent domination. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really simple. Say no to ALL the wars. Say no to violence everywhere you see it. </p>

<p>Peacefully demand an end to the wars and this hijacked government will fall very quickly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Supposedly we have this power to give these leaders thier power. So what step could we take as a nation of people that could revoke that power? If we I don&#39;t know, Occupied Wall Street or the captiol would they just relent and relinquish their power? Would they do as they swore and uphold our (mostly) just constitution? Hell NO!!! They would fight tooth and nail to hold on to their stranglehold on this country. I would not put pass full military &quot;protection&quot; for them. Every citizen in America could have an &quot;assualt rifle&quot; and it would do exactly nothing to a nuke being dropped on their heads. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You <em>are</em> underestimating the power people have over their leaders. Think about your surroundings.

<p>Governments aren&#39;t immune to those same effects. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This I can agree with, your position is consistent. I once even spiritually and intuitively understood your point. I have since been dragged back into the cycle. I need to meditate again :). </p>

<p>I find many people who don&#39;t have an issue with police arresting a person who has crossed a &#39;red line&#39; and confining them (a form of violence), but then not having a &#39;red line&#39; for government. </p>
