        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From 1969 to 1972, the US landed people on the moon six different times. The whole nation watched live on TV, as America performed the greatest technical feat of science and human history. However, <a href="http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/616295/nasa_cant_find_original_tape_of_moon_landing/">NASA admitted in 2006</a> that they had lost all the original footage—700 boxes of transmission. In 2009, NASA revealed the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/20/us-nasa-tapes-idUSTRE56F5MK20090720">tapes had been erased</a>, but they are in the process of digitally remastering copies from CBS. These are not original recordings though, and at the very best, should be considered of vastly inferior quality.</p>

<p>“Because NASA’s equipment was not compatible with TV technology of the day, the original transmissions had to be displayed on a monitor and re-shot by a TV camera for broadcast.” —reuters article above</p>

<p>So the only evidence, that men were on the moon is a remastered TV recording of a recording of some kind of original feed somewhere, and lunar rocks. There’s no evidence that this was live, or streamed anywhere around the same time, and lunar rocks can be found here on Earth, in Antarctica.</p>

<p>In 2009, the Dutch Museum revealed that the lunar rock they had been gifted by Apollo-11 is actually <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8226075.stm">petrified wood</a>.   </p>

<p>No country, US, Russia, nor China, has been there ever since, though they are all devoted to the militarization of space.</p>

<p>As in the 9/11 truth, I think arguing about &#39;the science&#39; of the event is a black hole, and a distraction from the real point, that in the case of the Moon landings, somehow NASA lost and erased the most important footage ever. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure, but I think this might be because no man has ever been to the moon, but I&#39;d love to be proven wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They were recorded in a custom high-definition format supported by only a very tiny handful of very expensive tape machines.</p>

<p>And so they were converted to standard video, and THAT is what was kept - being the only usable standard.</p>

<p>Some of the original HD tapes then got reused for later missions.  Remember, by the time Apollo 11 landed, NASA&#39;s budget had already been shrinking fast for several years.</p>

<p>A common standard for HD video didn&#39;t come until decades later - long after those HD machines used for Apollo had gone out of service.  At least one of those machines has been restored, along with <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/hd/apollo11.html">some of the &quot;lost&quot; videos.</a></p>

<p>There is enough evidence for me.  </p>

<p>Spacecraft have photographed the landing sites, including objects left behind, and tracks from the rovers.  </p>

<p>One imaging satellite recently mapped the topography of the landing site, and it <strong>exactly</strong> matches what was shown on the video.   </p>

<p>The ability to mock up such a set that perfectly would be beyond their capabilities.  They had no way to know what it would look like back then.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No-one is claiming that it&#39;s too hard to revisit the moon.</p>

<p>When Americans could suddenly see a Soviet machine (Sputnik) flying overhead, it was a Very Big Deal.  The same with the first man in space being Soviet.  People demanded that Something Be Done.  And so the American space program was funded.</p>

<p>Once the Gemini flights were underway and America was demonstrably ahead, that demand disappeared.  And with no demand, NASA&#39;s funding was slashed and Saturn V production capped, even before Apollo 11.</p>

<p>Apollo coasted through the moon landings with what hardware was already in the pipeline.  Just a few months after Apollo 11, Apollo 13 couldn&#39;t even get air time on TV.  (Until they had a problem.)  And that was it for funding.</p>

<p>There&#39;s been no real demand to return to the moon.  Bush II announced a plan after the Columbia accident, but he didn&#39;t follow it up with political support or funding.</p>

<p>As for the rest, engineers can run the numbers, and confirm that there was no reason the launchers and spacecraft couldn&#39;t do what was claimed.  We KNOW that the Saturn Vs and other Apollo hardware was built.  Some of it is still around, and over 50,000 people were part of building it.</p>

<p>Thousands of people prepped the launch site, erected the Saturn Vs, and loaded the spacecraft on top.  Hundreds of thousands of people watched the launches.  Tracking stations in several other countries tracked the spacecraft to the moon.</p>

<p>Many of the modern-day people providing the modern satellite imagery of the landing sites weren&#39;t around back in the Apollo era.</p>

<p>The conspiracy you describe would require hundreds of thousands of people in on it - in NASA, countless private companies, and other organizations around the world - over two or three generations spanning 55 years.  With none of them talking even now.</p>

<p>And just the video of the dust flying up around the astronaut&#39;s feet and rovers&#39; wheels - NOT acting like it&#39;s in air - could not be credibly faked in 2004 let alone 1969.</p>

<p>Flying to the moon was a whole lot easier than faking it.</p>

<p>Going with this sort of argument, I would say that if I was trying to fake something like that I would actually try to go out of my way to make sure things like that are in place because they add to the realism and allow you to sell the story better. </p>

In that case it makes no sense as man and mankind are the same thing. It&#39;s supposed to be A Man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has always been stated that he did say &#39;a man&#39;, but the &#39;a&#39; was lost because of their imperfect audio link.</p>

<p>If you listen to the recording, you&#39;ll notice the beginning and end of many words are obscured or dropped. Now if he didn&#39;t stress the &#39;a&#39;, it could have been dropped because it was lost behind the last syllable of &#39;for&#39;. If you&#39;ve ever used a team-speak software of sorts (ts, ventrilo, mumble), you may have played around with the mic settings using Voice Activated Transmission. Here you must set a threshold where the mic&#39;s input is reaches a level higher than background noise, and begins transmission. There would also be a cut-off property where transmission is cut when the input falls below the cut-off for a certain duration.</p>

<p>Add degradation and fading of the radio signal to the mix, and the missing &#39;a&#39; isn&#39;t too hard to explain. It has also been &quot;found&quot; in analysis of the original audio tapes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong.  Both make perfect sense although both have SLIGHTLY different meanings.  By saying &quot;One small step for man.....&quot;, he would be referring to MANKIND, you shallow-minded shill.  You&#39;re only saying this because you watched propaganda telling you that he didn&#39;t say what he was SUPPOSED to say..  That isn&#39;t proof of ANYTHING.  Your mind isn&#39;t even controlled by you.  Pathetic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I DID NOT claim that.  I never said that (to quote YOU &quot;one small step for mankind, one giant leap for mankind.&quot;).  You are the only person I have ever heard say that.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s known as a/the strawman tactic (for those watching at home, the &quot;strawman tactic&quot; is when a dipshit has no evidence or facts to debate with so they change your words, lie, and put words in your mouth, then said dipshit argues against the bullshit they just put in your mouth - seriously a pathetic tactic and a dead giveaway for disinfo/shill artists)....</p>

<p>So, you&#39;re a disinfo agent.  And you just proved it.  I&#39;d like you to quote where I EVER quoted Armstrong....  Can you?  No.  Because I didn&#39;t.  </p>

<p>The discrepancy you&#39;re referring to is between a single letter - the letter &quot;a&quot; - but let&#39;s face it - that has NOTHING to do with my post.  NOTHING.</p>

Your quote &quot;One small step for MANKIND, one giant leap for MANKIND&quot;..  See, there I used caps to emphasize the word MANKIND..

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing you&#39;ve proven is that you&#39;re a shallow, pained little man.  You claim to be a master of the English language yet in practice, you display that knowledge quite poorly.  Second, England did NOT &quot;invent&quot; the English language.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_English_language">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_English_language</a>  (I can&#39;t believe you just said that).  Seriously - I&#39;d prove your stupidity but you&#39;re doing a well enough job at that yourself.</p>

<p>Third, it was your inability to understand the &quot;English language&quot; that got you into this mess...  Namely your inability to understand what I said (when I called out your misquote).  Fourth, nice to hear you left Britain - it helped raise their national IQ average.  Fifth - yes, you ARE a straw man - you have proven that by continuously putting words in my mouth and then arguing them (that&#39;s the very definition).  Sixth - I don&#39;t really see that there is anything for me to be &quot;wrong&quot; about here - I mean you were obviously wrong from the get-go.  The only thing I did was call you out on it.  That, as a reminder, is what got you into this mess.  You couldn&#39;t handle being wrong so you went on your little dirty-diaper tantrum of name calling and yes - I will gladly reciprocate.  Finally, being a gay porn actor does NOT make you a &quot;film writer&quot; or &quot;assistant director&quot;.</p>

<p>You call me &quot;assumptive&quot; then you sit back and judge me over and over and over.  So typical.  This is another &quot;tell&quot;.  You may not realize it but when you say things like that you&#39;re just admitting your own insecurities to the world.  Seriously - you&#39;re like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar - you lie and deny in the face of your own guilt.  Pathetic.  Keep running and crying little man..</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Also, NASA is founded by Nazis</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From your own link:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Operation Paperclip was the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) program used to recruit the <strong>scientists of</strong> Nazi Germany for employment by the United States in the aftermath of World War II</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So that&#39;s scientists who <em>happened</em> to live in Nazi Germany, <strong>not</strong> &quot;Nazis&quot;.</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Truman&#39;s order expressly excluded anyone found &quot;to have been a member of the Nazi Party, and more than a nominal participant in its activities, or an active supporter of Nazi militarism&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Although that rule was apparently bent fairly liberally.)</p>

<p>Regardless, they didn&#39;t &quot;found NASA&quot;. That didn&#39;t happen until 1958. Operation Paperclip was in 1945, 13 years prior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still, that would not stop the russians from trying. There is no way they could have faked the landings from the Soviets. They had too much money, technology and were not subject to American laws, and wanted nothing more than to embarrass the US. They would have the means, money, and motivation to expose a fraud on such a level. Yet they remained completely silent and agreed. I would think that your greatest rival concedes defeat in the space race, there is no way they would have done it for a fraud that they knew was a fraud.</p>

<p>So where are all the former soviet space program workers coming out and telling us it was fake? they would be everywhere. Although the american population might not believe it, the global population might, and  having america have to prove it would have been devastating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s just it - they wouldn&#39;t have wasted their money trying because they knew that the only thing Americans knew about the USSR was what the newspapers, television and movies told them.  They simply didn&#39;t bother trying.  </p>

<p>The USSR may have even used the manned moon landings (whether true or not) to their advantage in that it accelerated their own industrial growth as a way of competition.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying there were no moon landings but I am saying that there is an air of doubt.   </p>

<p>Starting with Sputnik - the government could have hid that from the American people and any news of it could have been brushed off as preposterous.  Instead it was embraced and it triggered a space race which had a by-product of industrial and technological innovation along with an economical boom.  </p>

<p>Was there a moon program?  Of course.  Was there a MANNED moon program - maybe not.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Current dominant theory (based on evidence and logic) is that we DID land there BUT the footage we watched was fake...  That shouldn&#39;t be hard to believe - in the &quot;Space Race&quot;, during the Cold War (against our number 1 enemy), do you really think we would broadcast and publish our video and photos of the event?  Think about it. No, seriously, THINK ABOUT IT.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s your theory: 
&quot;Hey USSR and rest of world, here&#39;s our TOP SECRET LIVE video footage of the thing you wanted to see and do and the thing you spent a few $billion on but couldn&#39;t do.  We&#39;ll save you the time and money.  Watch our footage and photos for FREE...  We are going to broadcast it LIVE in Times Square for you to see.  Also, we&#39;ll send it to you.  Here, have a look&quot;....  Great example of logic fail.</p>

<p>Great documentary on the subject:</p>

Bill Clinton couldn&#39;t even get a blowjob from an intern without the entire world finding out and that was an act between 2 people.  Faking the moon landing would have involved scientists, astronauts, engineers, presumably the president, all of their families would have to be kept in the dark.  A film crew used to film the &quot;staged footage.&quot;  It&#39;s just too much to expect this to not come out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have done research.  Enough to know that in July of 1969 we did, in fact, send a crew to the moon.  The point I was making was that if we are going to spend the money on fuel and launch a space craft into orbit for 8 days you are already risking the lives of the crew and dealing with the expense of an extended mission.  Rather than risk the reputation of the entire country by hoaxing a moon landing at that point it would be smarter to attempt the actual moon landing. (Which they did successfully).  My idea of research is reading history and listening to lectures from astrophysicists explaining how this happened.  I have a feeling you watched &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon&quot; and called it a day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I certainly am using him as a reference for some of the information that I am giving.  Neil didn&#39;t really make an argument.  He stated the fact of the amount of fuel that was used. (To my knowledge that is the part of his &quot;argument&quot; that I am &quot;parroting&quot;).  However, if I am going to take information from somebody who would know, he is a pretty solid source.  The fear of the Van Allen Belt was real which is why the astronauts&#39; craft was guarded from radiaton as best as we knew how.  Radiation is dangerous because of quantity + exposure time.  The craft&#39;s best defense was to be shielded and to pass through the belt as quickly as possible (which it did).  Humans have a history of doing dangerous things in the name of discovery.  Explorers used to sail around the world before they were even entirely sure that they wouldn&#39;t eventually sail off the edge of a potentially flat earth.  Don&#39;t underestimate human ingenuity.  All the information you would need to find is available if you are willing to read it/listen to it without immediately dismissing it as your mind is already made up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Somehow I don&#39;t think you want to be proven wrong.  There is a tremendous amount of evidence to show that we went to the moon.  Pictures can be taken from here on earth that show the moon landing site.  You can say those were faked, but what about the massive rockets that were launched? What about the thousands of people that watched these rockets take off?  You can calculated the amount of fuel used to get from here to the moon, and the amount of time it would take, and that lines up perfectly with what we&#39;re told.  On top of that, you have hundreds if not thousands of people who worked on this project, and not one of them has peeped about it being fake?</p>

<p>We have astronauts that are living in a space station floating above the earth.  We have robots that have been to several of the planets.  We have thousands of satellites floating above our planet and one that&#39;s leaving our solar system.  We certainly have demonstrated that the technology exists to send a man to the moon, and there is a lot of very convicing evidence to show a location on the moon where people landed.  You can believe what you want, but from a logical and legistical perspective, it&#39;s hard to deny that the moon landing took place.</p>

I on the other hand think there are enough peculiarities about to warrant skepticism of the official story. In addition to what OP stated there is also the radiation belt, the fact that we still haven&#39;t been back despite it being nearly fifty years, the extremely high success rate of the missions, considering the technology of the time, and the government and nasa also had great pressure to be successful. </p>

<p>All that being said, I spent most of my childhood reading every book on space that I could find. To say that I was fascinated with being an astronaut would be an understatement indeed.

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, but that is an incorrect assumption, one that I only hear when someone is defending the legitimacy of the moon landings. The moon is the first stepping stone out of this world and NASA wants a base there. There is a possibility to harvest helium 3, which can be used in power generators and nuclear fission, a possible means of craft propulsion. It may also be used to construct the actual crafts themselves. Also, The gravity is much weaker allowing for less fuel requirements, one of the biggest setbacks currently facing rocket designers. There are more reasons but think of it like early ship building and seafaring. Had to get to the island across the pond before you ever had a chance of making it to another continent.</p>

<p>Should we have a base on the moon? Probably, but not yet. There&#39;s no need. We don&#39;t have the infrastructure to mine he-3 and to ship it back to earth and effectively use it to generate power.</p>

<p>I am sure the IRS has its share of people truly passionate about accurate accounting, the military its share of people who truly love their country and the police force has some who still believe in the supremacy of the Bill of Rights...but yet, the beat goes on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recently watched Dark Mission (3 hours) by UFOTVstudios on youtube. Excellent documentary very scientific and I love the two main hosts. Especially the science &quot;host&quot;. They present a very good case but I wasn&#39;t entirely convinced, only that it was plausible.</p>

<p>I then watched the NASA 6 part series When We Left Earth (6 hours). In bluray it looks amazing and covers the entire space program from its inception of unmanned rocket tests until the first space station, the shuttle and the repair of the Hubble telescope/satellite.</p>

<p>I recommend watching these in the same order.</p>

<hr/>

<p>After watching both I felt that NASA has purposely skipped over a couple of controversial points presented in the Dark Mission documentary. With that I don&#39;t mean ignored I just mean that in the footage they were showing or the time frame it was set up had a potential inconsistency. While it provided a ton of footage I did felt it also left a few holes that allow some of the Dark Mission points to plug in. </p>

<p>So I feel a bit more informed but not enough to be convinced of anything. I&#39;d have to watch the NASA episodes regarding to the moon landings again but with a very critical eye in order to spot some things I felt were a bit wierd in my first viewing in order to determine if those can actually be valid or if I was simply entertaining the idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While we did visit the moon, the footage was all fake.  It was filmed by Stanley Kubrick.  Not saying we didn&#39;t land on the moon - just stating the fact that 99% of the film and photos you have seen were filmed by Stanley Kubrick here, on planet Earth.  Think it&#39;s crazy?  Why in the hell would we broadcast our footage - during the space race - fought against our &quot;enemy&quot; of that time?  Yeah, we were both trying to get there and we both spent $*illions on it, to see what was there but HEY, USSR, here&#39;s all the footage of it!  For Free!  Seriously people - think about it!  Why would we broadcast our intel to the world!?  This was an early (but not the first) example of MSM broadcasting pre-staged bullshit to the American people (while the world watched) - and it WORKED.  </p>

<p>For the non-shills, there are some great documentaries on this - notably &quot;Kubrick&#39;s Odyssey: Secrets Hidden in the Films of Stanley Kubrick; Part One: Kubrick and Apollo&quot;...</p>

<p>In short, NASA realizes that today&#39;s inquiring mind isn&#39;t as simple and easily fooled as the American (and global) mind of the 60&#39;s, 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s...  Also, modern technology has proven the footage and photos to be staged (watch the documentary for more info on that).  </p>

<p>AGAIN, not saying we didn&#39;t go to the moon or land there - just saying that the footage was fake..  Quite frankly, I would have done the same.</p>

<p>No that doesn&#39;t make sense. Do you have any idea how expensive that would be? We can test most of it on earth, simulate the rest, fix the problems here, and launch it only once for a tiny fraction of the cost. It worked didn&#39;t it? The Moon and Mars aren&#39;t really that much more comparable than the Earth and Mars anyway. Completely different environments.</p>

<p>Okay, maybe &quot;comparatively little gain&quot; was a poor choice of words, but the point is that we&#39;re not as interested in the Moon anymore and would rather focus on Mars. If other people want to go to the Moon, whether for scientific knowledge about it or to work their way up to bigger and better space programs, that&#39;s fine.</p>

<p>You are missing the point that people still to this day are sending unmanned probes to the moon, and yet for some reason the footage of Mars is better than the moon.  If you can see something possibly a little askew with this state of affairs...</p>

<p>The first mammals to orbit the moon were human. That right there should set off alarm bells for any competent engineer.</p>

<p>How did the spacesuits protect against any micro-meteorites that are constantly bombarding the moon? Moreover, any slight puncture of the space suit would almost immediately kill any astronaut - yet no one who was &quot;walking on the moon&quot; showed any real concern.</p>

<p>There is no evidence of hypergolic thrust in the <a href="http://youtu.be/cOdzhQS_MMw">Apollo 17</a> liftoff video. Futher, the Apollo 17 liftoff video shows the emittance of flame. How can flame exist in an oxygen free environment?</p>

<p>The LM was never tested under landing conditions - and under basic test conditions, no astronaut could ever land the LM.</p>
