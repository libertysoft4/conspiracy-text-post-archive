    <div class="md"><p>Look at his Twitter, there&#39;s also lots of things he said there that are not typical of a terrorist. However, the evidence seems overwhelming that he is a terrorist, carjacked someone, and murdered that MIT cop in cold blood.

<p>If these guys had worked so hard for so long, and younger brother especially seems bright, then why do they appear to be such incompetent criminals?</p>
