Also, in that article a representative of 7-11 is quoted as saying, &quot;surveillance video of the crime was not taken&quot;.</p>

<p>The MIT officer was shot <a href="http://i.imgur.com/73XcmBN.png">within 600 ft of the 7-11</a>. The original suspect that was being looked for was a <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/lookout/gunman-reportedly-shoots-police-officer-mit-boston-034906627.html;_ylt=AwrNUbBQPXpRwzgA8hDQtDMD">&quot;black male wearing black clothing and weighing approximately 120 pounds&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>Now, the official story is that Dzhokhar was <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2313489/Boston-bomber-Dzhokhar-Tsarnaev-seen-using-stolen-ATM-card-cash-new-surveillance-images.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490">using a stolen credit card right around the same time</a>, and (apparently) made a switch to wearing a hat, while he did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly!  I was on board with the Official story until all these lies (every single aspect of this story has now come out as being untrue).  I&#39;ve gone back to the Police radio transcriptions, there&#39;s so much that is unanswered and swept under the rug with this.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still trying to find who were the very last people to be suspected of this crime prior to the FBI rush releasing the photos of these suspects.  Can anyone point me to it.  I&#39;m so tired right now and I can&#39;t even find the exact time of the first report of these two suspects to damn well find if anyone else was spotted just prior to the released images.</p>

<p>The FBI said for more than 24 hours that they had a video of the suspects, they already knew who they were (apparently) so were holding onto them, and then suddenly, with no warning whatsoever they released the images of the suspects.  Whoever was put on 4chan or Reddit just prior to this are probably the real culprits.  </p>

Official accounts say tamerlan came and knocked on the window before Dzhokhar managed to purchase anything and left empty handed, but in this picture <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/04/23/article-2313489-1973B962000005DC-285_634x387.jpg">http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/04/23/article-2313489-1973B962000005DC-285_634x387.jpg</a> <a href="http://michaelgraham.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/suspect-lastest-pic.jpg">http://michaelgraham.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/suspect-lastest-pic.jpg</a> u can clearly see Tamerlan in the window as Dzhokhar ENTERS the store with redbulls in his hand, so how does the hostage&#39;s story match up to this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is reasonably safe to presume there was no kidnap victim.  This is fiction.  The FBI have admitted they kept tabs on Tamerlan, so when they released the images they knew exactly who it was - they&#39;d held it all back for more than 24 hours.  There are no real, up-close witnesses to Tamerlan being hit by a car at all, just people who watched from a distance.  Nothing caught on any video even remotely suggests a car screaming down the road and hitting anything!  So this didn&#39;t happen either.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all lies.  Let&#39;s go back to the start and look again!</p>

<p>He corroborates the evidence that Dzhokar jumped in the SUV after Tamerlan rushed the cops, and that he ran him over as he crashed through the police blockade. Also, there are pictures of the bloody streak/chalk outline.</p>

<p>Yeah, if my face was plastered across every news outlet in the country I would definitely &quot;stick with&quot; the hat that I&#39;m seen wearing instead of changing into something else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He might not have even seen the news!  He&#39;s a student and a weed toker, the news isn&#39;t exactly what you watch when you&#39;re monged out.  He went to the 7/11 because he&#39;d got the munchies, bought a jumbo pack of Pringles, went home to fap in front of the computer and the very next thing he knows he&#39;s rudely awakened and told &#39;run boy, we&#39;re gonna kill you&#39;.  His brother was probably several miles away being told the same, before making at far as outside his house then being hit by a car and shot whilst dead (no blood on the accident photos near the gunshots, shows post mortem shooting - I love CSI).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree - the first picture looks like he is exiting the store backwards.  Not sure what he is doing/looking at in the second... but maybe he was at the counter (the cashier is located right near the door) and, as you say, Tamerlan is telling him that they need to leave. </p>
