        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am a military veteran and served one 4 year enlistment between 1998 and 2002.  During this time, I participated in several military exercises (to train and prepare for wartime scenarios) with one happening nearly every year.  This training included bomb-raid drills, chemical decontamination, security patrols, and even repairing simulated holes in concrete as if we were repairing the runway which had been bombed.</p>

<p>While this was fun (in a weird twisted way) it was by no means the only drills the military participates in.  While I was active duty, I was assigned to a team that traveled through 3 different states and participated in local disaster preparedness drills.  During these drills, I, as an actor, would be dressed up in moulage and placed in a scenario for the local police, fire departments, and ambulances to respond to.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 1</strong></p>

<p>The first scenario I remember was the simulated carjacking and hostage situation on a greyhound-type bus which was parked in the fairgrounds of the town we were in.  There were at least two actors who were playing the bad guys and were going up and down the isle yelling/cussing at the passengers and pushing them around.  The police responded and eventually the bad guys &quot;gave up&quot;.  There were no shots fired, nobody actually injured, or anything.  The paramedics arrived to &quot;treat&quot; the people on the bus.  I remember being loaded onto a stretcher and wheeled into one of the fairground buildings as a &quot;triage&quot; staging location.  After everyone on the bus was removed and &quot;treated&quot; the scenario ended.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 2</strong></p>

<p>The stage for the next scenario was some sort of courthouse or city town center building.  All I remember about the building was that it was small, old, and had wooden floors throughout.  There was a staircase (which I was placed in) so it must&#39;ve had multiple floors.  The stairs were wood too.  Anyhow, the scenario for this emergency preparedness drill was that there was a gunman who had entered this government building and shot up the place.  I was dressed in moulage and was supposed to be dead from a gunshot wound.  Really, they just put some red makeup on my shirt and made a hole in it but they didn&#39;t use any fake blood.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The military, local governments, hospitals, etc all participate in drills to test their preparedness should an emergency scenario happen.  It is a good training method for the personnel as they get to learn with a hands-on approach.  Yes, I was an actor and played an injured person.  The people &quot;treating&quot; me had no idea who I was.  There were cameras around and they were filming for other training purposes (perhaps even local news segments).</p>

<p>Ask me anything! :)</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>A few additional things I thought were important:</p>

<ul>
<li>As far as I know, all of the local emergency personnel were aware that they were participating in a drill and that everything is fake.  Obviously it wouldn&#39;t work for the hostage-takers if the police actually shot them for waving a fake weapon.</li>
<li>None of our people were wearing military uniforms, it was all civilian clothing.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t remember the town&#39;s names but the states were South Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana. (We swung back through the corner of North Dakota just to say we had been there too)</li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT 2:  Looks like the downvote brigade has arrived 3 hrs in.  Multiple questions &amp; responses have taken a dive.</p>

<p>I have not <em>experienced</em> a drill that was turned into the real thing.  Still, they could have easily made any one of these drills that I participated in into the real thing by changing just one or two things...  the only thing they would have to do was give the &quot;hostage takers&quot; actual weapons and have them actually hit the passengers or shoot a couple of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;ve been posting on Reddit for about 2 years. You post regularly to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and always have. From UFOs, to people taking your guns, you&#39;ve posted it on here. You&#39;ve stepped up a lot of posting on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> recently (escaping into an imaginary world due to something going wrong in the real world?).</p>

<p><strong>And throughout all of your time on Reddit, and all of your posts on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, this is the first time that you ever, ever have mentioned this. Quite odd isn&#39;t it?</strong></p>

<p>Also, surely all of these instances were heavily covered by the news? Surely you can directly link us to the news articles which reported these &#39;drills&#39;? Or were you just not that interested?</p>

<p>Also, you&#39;re (at least borderline) racist. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/13xku5/michael_dunn_florida_man_invokes_stand_your/c783zie?context=3">here</a> primarily, but also in a post (on your profile, but deleted from the subreddit) where you suggest that detroit&#39;s illiteracy rates are because of the black majority there.</p>

<li><p>I&#39;ve mentioned my participation in these events with my friends IRL but I try not to share much of my personal life online.  I thought this might be relevant to recent events so I thought I&#39;d share my experience.  From my point of view, I was doing nothing wrong by participating in these emergency preparedness exercises and never considered they could easily be turned into the real thing with me being an actual casualty... everything was on the up-and-up.</p></li>
<li><p>Racism exists.  I don&#39;t find myself racist (thinking that one race is superior to another) but I also recognize the distinct differences and preferences between each race.  Some are better than other at different things but there&#39;s no all-encompassing attribute that makes one race superior than another.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is everybody freaking out about him hiding something?  These types of things go on all of the time to prepare public &amp; private emergency services.  I participated in several back in the early double aughts.  I was actually involved in the special fx &amp; makeup, though.  The first one we did was for a high school to scare the kids around homecoming (don&#39;t drink and drive and all of that).  All of the kids who were playing the corpses/victims were rounded up in the gym, we did the makeup on them, and they were all taken out to a mock car crash out in front of the school.  Then ambulances came out and used the jaws of life, pulled the victims out, put them on stretchers, etc. while the whole school watched.  It was good training for the EMT&#39;s, police, and firemen, and was also a scared-straight tactic for the school kids.  The only people who didn&#39;t know it was happening were the kids who were pulled out of classes.  It was pretty obvious what was going on by the time they got outside, though.  I did one more similar to that at another high school, and then the last one I did was for a big ass coke-plant (the coal by-product, not the tasty beverage).  That one was actually a terrorist attack drill that involved more police and whatnot.  Lots of burn &amp; explosion victims, who were all employees for said coke-plant doubling as actors.  I never was involved in any mock disasters that involved professional actors.  This shit goes on all of the time, especially in small towns who might not regularly encounter this kind of stuff.  It is good training.  Anyway, my point is that a lot of people are exposed to this kind of stuff and probably have never really thought to say much of anything (like myself) because is is a fairly common practice, especially in small towns or areas with a lot of emergency service personnel who need training.  I could see how bigger cities would probably have to cart in professional or paid extras to really pull off bigger disasters so their people could be properly trained.  I don&#39;t think there is much of a conspiracy here.  Again, this shit goes on all of the time, all across the country.  I have a friend who actually worked for a contractor who made mock disaster supplies (special fx prosthetics, blood, etc.) for the US Army.  The Army does shit on a much bigger scale, and have a fuck ton more people to train than local community emergency services.  There was good money in making these supplies, and government contracts to be had.  It has been going on for a loooong time.  I actually had a US Army casualty simulation kit from the 80&#39;s.  Pretty primitive shit.  Truthfully, most casualty simulation kits haven&#39;t progressed much in that time-frame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How much were you paid?  Since you were active duty, where were you stationed?  What made you just NOW want to discuss this?  You say they had the news present for one of the scenarios, do you remember which station, or what the cities were?  Do you have any photos from the drills?  I assume you could show us some sort of military paperwork to confirm you were w/ the military?  Also if these drills were closed to the public, I&#39;d assume they gave you an ID badge for walking around the &quot;set,&quot; or did they take them back after the drills were over?</p>

<li>Requests for information that can identify me personally is denied.  Yes I could provide proof of being in the military but that is personal information you are not privy to.</li>
<li>Recent circumstances with rumors of &quot;disaster actors&quot; made this story relevant in revealing that actors are used in emergency preparedness drills.  Obviously, it wouldn&#39;t take much to make these drills into the real thing</li>
<li>I said someone was filming the scenarios.  I don&#39;t know who it was that was filming.  As I stated, it could&#39;ve been the news, the hospital staff, or someone hired to record it.  ~13 years ago I didn&#39;t care about this stuff.</li>
<li>No photos, documentation wasn&#39;t important at the time.  I was just some young kid.</li>
<li>No ID badges were issued.  The scenarios were really small (&lt;50 or so).  Our team was 6 people.  The cities provided other participants/actors.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean you could easily use paint to black out any personal information..  Maybe you could provide that to a MOD?  I know in the r/Iama you have to have some sort of proof.  </p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t you say anything after Sandy Hook?  Most of the sub was about it being a hoax, way more than Boston.  Why not post then when it was a much bigger topic?</p>

<p>This took place 13ish years ago?  So they were preparing for this sort of thing before 9/11 took place.  That&#39;s interesting.</p>

<li>I&#39;ll see if I can find an electronic DD214 and block out some info since images can be easily manipulated.</li>
<li>I said stuff to my friends IRL.  Telling <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> didn&#39;t occur to me.  Sandy Hook definitely looked like a drill.  There was no evidence that anything happened, only the words of people.</li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT:  Preparing for current false-flag operations 13 years ago?  Maybe, but I never considered that my group was doing that at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Youre definitely right about Sandy Hook.  Although it looks shift, all we have to go by are some aerial photos and word of mouth..  Which we all know isn&#39;t enough evidence..  </p>

<p>I wonder how long they have been doing these live action drills..  If they were doing them 13 years ago, who knows how far back these drills go..</p>

<li><p>Level of action: Some people &quot;hammed&quot; it up more than others.  In the first scenario I was pretty hung-over so I&#39;m sure I moaned and groaned quite a bit.  We laughed at the bad guys but they were acting pretty serious.  In the second scenario I was playing dead while they checked my vitals and moved on to the next person.</p></li>
<li><p>The people filming were wearing normal civilian clothing.  The camera was pretty fancy (large) but I don&#39;t remember seeing a news van.  Could&#39;ve been the hospital staff or someone hired to record everything.</p></li>
<li><p>No, I never got to see any of the training videos.  They never told us who was planning anything or how the military became involved in their emergency response drills.  I was just told where to go and what my role was and told to just wait.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>As others have discovered, nothing is truly verifiable.  Images can be manipulated. Video can be faked.  Documents can be forged.  At some point in the very end, you have to take something on faith... even with topics as large as &quot;the earth is round&quot;.  You can&#39;t say that you&#39;ve actually verified that the earth is round.  You can&#39;t measure it.  You can&#39;t see it.  All you have to go on is the video and claims of other people (plus the larger social acceptance/bandwagon effect).</p>

<p>If I asked you to provide proof of a job you worked on 13 years ago, what would you be able to provide?  Maybe old tax documents that proved you worked for the company?  Do you have any pictures of yourself sitting at the desk (or holding a shovel/spatula)?  Not as easy as it seems, eh?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not qualified to speak on the events of the Boston bombing.  Obviously I have seen many of the videos, photos, and media segments but that doesn&#39;t mean that I really know what happened any more than you.  It&#39;s possible there were actors and it&#39;s possible there were not.  It&#39;s possible it was staged and it&#39;s possible it was not.  It&#39;s also possible that the government will sacrifice some of its own people to achieve its objectives which many of us civilians may not know about or agree with...  It could also just be some crazy Chechen brothers who hate America for their freedoms.</p>
