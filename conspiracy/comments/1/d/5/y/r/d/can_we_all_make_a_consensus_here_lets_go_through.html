        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the time since all this went down new information has come to light. </p>

<p>1) we know that the crisis actor theory holds no validity</p>

<p>2) there are pictures with the Tsarnaev brothers in a gun fight with police showing they are not innocent. </p>

<p>3) the big screen TV thing has been explained and dismissed. </p>

<p>4) the naked man is not Tamerlan. Tamerlan is dead. </p>

<p>Now if we can all agree on these points it will help filter out about 75% of the nonsense regarding theories on the events. Some other theories (ie: the FBI involvement in radicalism theory still hold some credence at this point) should still be entertained and debated. If we want this sub to clean up everyone that sees one of the 4 posts i referenced should immediately downvote them. That&#39;s what the buttons are for. Hopefully by doing this people will get the message that theories already proven by evidence to be false will not be given attention here. </p>

<p>If I missed anything let me know and I will make edits. Also if what I&#39;ve laid out here as a game plan is flawed please discuss it with me in the comments.</p>

<p>[Edit 1: up vote for visibility if you support this sentiment. I&#39;m no karma whore. There isn&#39;t match karma to farm here anyway. I just really want to see this place clean up a bit so we can stop the civil war in this sub and get back to civil debate.]</p>

If he is the &quot;mastermind&quot; or is radicalizing these young men to commit acts of terror he and his ilk need to be stopped.

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t actually know who is doing what in the gunfight photos. Yea, it appears that maybe Tamerlan has a gun, and maybe Dzhokhar doesn&#39;t, but if you&#39;re talking about that blogger&#39;s photos I don&#39;t think we can really say definitively. I think you&#39;re probably right, but I also think it can be argued it just isn&#39;t clear enough. Just my 2 cents...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand your sentiment. You can&#39;t necessarily see a gun in the photos. But you can see powder marks on the road from an explosive device that was tossed by them. Also I don&#39;t see a reason for that blogger to lie about the events he witnessed. He couldn&#39;t be a plant. There is no way that someone could have the foreknowledge to place someone in a house that just so happened to be right where the shoot out took place. The bloggers post should be taken with some credibility as he has evidence to back his claims. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>-I don&#39;t believe the younger brother ever had a weapon. Besides the explosives no weapon has ever been ties to him. </p>

<p>-and I know the official story isn&#39;t always to be believed but the explanation for the explosion is that the pressure cooker broke open when they tossed it at police which is why there wasn&#39;t so much of an explosion as there was more of a flash fire produced from it. Which would fit with the burn pattern on the ground. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very funny.  If you explore my recent comments, you would find that the online conversation actually occurred.   Since you act as if you are interested in seeking the truth, why not chat with one of the witnesses of the shooting incident yourself, instead of acting like a bitchy walking e-meter and dismissing everything as if only you know the truth.</p>

<p>you&#39;re also a scientologist?  cool.</p>

<p>I know what isn&#39;t the truth.. and every day we find out a little more what isn&#39;t the truth. Now we hear Dzhokhar wasn&#39;t armed, but police shot the fuck out of that boat...what next?</p>

<p>Good to keep an open mind.  So you had a conversation with someone who says they saw it.  I&#39;ll look at your comments sure.   I don&#39;t find online chats reliable.   I&#39;m not expecting to talk to any witnesses.  There should be dashcam video of some of these incidents.. so far I wouldn&#39;t dismiss an execution based on a 2nd hand account of a supposed online conversation with a supposed witness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A dashcam video might clear things up.  Between the other witnesses photos and this guy, it&#39;s pretty clear to me that the brother&#39;s weren&#39;t pacifists in this situation.  If they were setting off explosions here, it&#39;s likely they also were doing so at the Boston Marathon.  But given the official&#39;s track record of releasing bad information, who is to know for sure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, I&#39;ve seen and heard nothing that convinces me that they were shooting back.. but then I wasn&#39;t there.   Of course we know the police story is already changing..so they aren&#39;t so reliable.</p>

<p>All police should be wearing cameras, dashcams mandatory, and ones that they can&#39;t turn off or cover up.  </p>

<p>the worst part about it all is that their story makes NO sense, and there are too many conflicting facts presented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.  Where is the video of Suspect #2 dropping his backpack at the Boston Marathon.  Where is the guy whose car was hijacked?  Not one friend of Suspect #2 thinks he did it.  The delay of reading the Miranda Rights and withholding information from the public makes me more suspicious of the government than the kid.  There were a thousand security officials at the race and they failed to stop the explosions - not good.  Were 9000 cops really necessary to catch two suspects?  Why arent the officials coming clean about the fuckup at the boat?  His brother sounds like a piece of work, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps I&#39;m wanting too much here, but these pictures leave a lot to be desired.
* At picture 1 you are already in the heat of the action, so you have no idea how it started.
* The blogger talks about how he goes up to his room with an IPhone5 and instead of taking video (which would show us the gunfire and the explosion) he takes photos.
* He mentions how they used the backpacks and back of the car for supplies, and from what I can tell makes STRONG assumptions on what those supplies are. e.g. &quot;the car where they had additional supplies (assumingly, more ammunition and explosives).&quot;
* He mentions the bomb and the smoke but fails to take VIDEO again, I&#39;m sorry, I just can&#39;t understand the no video thing. And also stops taking pictures until the car is taking off...
* Not only does he inexplicably not document the bomb and the eldest brothers mad race towards cops, but he narrates us through it. As in, it wasn&#39;t because he was cowering behind a wall like I would at that point, he&#39;s watching... and just not documenting. </p>

<p>These photos reveal nothing we didn&#39;t already know. They cannot truly identify the suspects because you can&#39;t see them in any kind of clarity. Since the video wasn&#39;t taken you can&#39;t see who was shooting, what the boys did to the explosive, whether the eldest brother was surrendering, or fighting.</p>

<p>All I know is that this confirmed the brothers guilt without actually being clear and definitive evidence. And that every time I look through the blog post I&#39;m overwhelmed with frustration that none of it was videotaped. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They were just holding up their hands making gun shapes with their hands yelling &quot;pew pew pew&quot;.  They were drugged up by the illuminati to pretend to be in the gun fight.  The cops were shooting blanks to convince neighbors that there was a gun fight going on.  There are no 1080p close up videos of the gunfight, so obviously they&#39;re hiding something!  I personally think it might not have been the brothers!  Here&#39;s what I thought up last night, I think I figured it out.  They were government actors.  The cops were with the FBI wearing police uniforms.  They were all firing blanks trying to convince neighbors it was a real gunfight.  It&#39;s so obvious!  I want a picture 2 inches in front of their faces to know it was them!  Wait, that&#39;s not enough.  With today&#39;s hollywood makeup and special effects, that could be faked too!  I want their DNA!  Wait, even if they found DNA, it could have been planted by their Uncle who works for the government.  Maybe if someone could invent a time machine to let me go back and see it for myself.  Wait! Maybe the FBI would go back in time without me knowing and change the events to trick me into believing their story!  Maybe if they taped a confession?  Wait, that&#39;s not enough either!  If he confessed, then that means they are controlling his brain.  That&#39;s why they sent him to a military hospital!!!!  Oh man!  I DON&#39;T KNOW!?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to disagree with you on #2 in that it draws a legal conclusion.  The photos show the brothers in a gun fight with police.  We don&#39;t know why they are fighting or if they are guilty or innocent.  Does it look bad for them?  Sure it does - but I don&#39;t want to get into the habit of drawing conclusions based on a few photos)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that should be disregarded at all.  His testimony is very powerful, but an admission of something is just an admission.  It indicates guilt, I just don&#39;t want to draw conclusions based on one or two pieces of information.  9 or 10 pieces and we can say &quot;Because of A, we have C&quot;  </p>

<p>For the record, my personal belief is that these two are the bombers.  Until I see some pretty substantial evidence that they are not, or that they have been set up, or any other popular conspiracy theories, I&#39;m going to maintain that belief.  That&#39;s why I come here - to see what alternative theories are out there and to ascertain their strength.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A simple explanation of this is the following.</p>

<p>Instead of saying</p>

<p>&quot;We are accused of the Boston bombing&quot; one of the brothers panicked and said &quot;We are the Boston bombers&quot;.</p>

<p>Whatever the two brothers said while trying to run away from the police in a state of panic, should be treated very carefully. (I would be panicked if an army of officers were after me, and accused me of killing people, even if I didn&#39;t do it)</p>

<p>Remember, panicked people never make good decisions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In regards to #2, there are also a half-dozen videos of the shoot-out.  More importantly than the fact that this event was recorded on video by several people, is the fact that there exists <strong>audio</strong> of the event from a multitude of angles.</p>

<p>There are also eye-witness reports from several other people, who live in that neighborhood.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the scanner recording.</p>

<p>Lastly this is where it has been officially determined (proven?) as the location of Tamerlan&#39;s death.</p>

<p>-- Just pointing out that &quot;a handful of grainy pictures&quot; of the Watertown shoot-out isn&#39;t ALL there is.  Also, in the future, I believe we will learn about much more evidence collected from that street, that shows it went down exactly as they say it went down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My biggest concern so far is that the younger brother was apparently unarmed when he was hiding in the boat, while the police/media narrative for days after included dramatic descriptions of cops exchanging gunfire with the younger brother, shooting from inside the boat. </p>

<p>(Here are two links:</p>

<p><a href="http://m.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/officials-boston-suspect-had-no-firearm-when-barrage-of-bullets-hit-hiding-place/2013/04/24/376fc8a0-ad18-11e2-a8b9-2a63d75b5459_story.html">http://m.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/officials-boston-suspect-had-no-firearm-when-barrage-of-bullets-hit-hiding-place/2013/04/24/376fc8a0-ad18-11e2-a8b9-2a63d75b5459_story.html</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2013/04/24/officials-suspect-unarmed-when-arrested-boat/15RdBrwnAoMLdWlVun5GXI/story.html">http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2013/04/24/officials-suspect-unarmed-when-arrested-boat/15RdBrwnAoMLdWlVun5GXI/story.html</a> </p>

<p>There are other stories to be found VIA Google news search, including one by CNN.)</p>

<p>This narrative continued long after the police would have known positively that there was no gun in the boat, which means they were lying. Or, if you prefer, omitting key information while actively pushing a compelling narrative probability. This narrative was fed to the mass media which eagerly adopted it.</p>

<p>(Here&#39;s the Watertown Police chief spinning it: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFLunTe3aBQ&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=14m38s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFLunTe3aBQ&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=14m38s</a>   )</p>

<p>Now, after its revealed with a high degree of confidence that this narrative was false, you&#39;d expect to see some focus on this in the media. Catching officials with their pants down is the bread and butter of in-the-trenches journalists all across America (source: I was one for ten years.) </p>

<p>Instead, other than some print stories, the CNN and MSNBC cable news machines have steadfastly ignored this (dunno about Fox, as I don&#39;t pay much attention to them.) This is information about a key part of the overall story. It&#39;s something that would warrant immediate examination and considerable editorial backtracking and clarification. Which, oddly, is not happening. The majors have decided to ignore this in favor of spinning  more compelling narrative probabilities.</p>

<p>Which makes them complicit in a lie handed to them by officials. </p>

<p>Which raises serious concerns about the credibility of other information being reported.</p>

<p>The logical questions raised by this is obvious: if the cops and the media lied about this... ?</p>

<p>We may never know the identity of the naked man. Charges were most likely never filed against him so he was released. Since there were no charges his name doesn&#39;t have to be released publicly. I just think its a bad idea to put focus on him because if and when he does step forward to disprove this specific theory it will only give more cannon fodder to attack all conspiracy theories pertaining to the situation. </p>

<p>edit: the tv screen was a display screen at the race. It was in photos ont he day or two days before the race, but then was moved to a different area. There was a conspiracy out of that, really I don&#39;t understand why. But it was found out that this screen was actually built on a truck so it could be easily moved, and was just in a different location on the day of the race.</p>

<li><p>The originals on his twitter don&#39;t confirm anything.  I still really want to know how these were enhanced since I can&#39;t get anything close to those results in photoshop, solid white exposure from headlights has absolutly nothing to enhance.</p></li>
<li><p>There never was a good theory about the TV that I saw, this is the only mention of it since the one single time I saw it.  Makes sense that it would be taken down in between the 2 hours of the first finishers of the race(the most televised and publicized part of race) and the bombings that occurred 2 hours later.</p></li>
<li><p>The naked man looks like Tamerlan.  Why would you tell us to ignore this until we see an update to this?</p></li>

<p>I think it&#39;s funny how you clump 2 fairly non valid theories with 2 highly interesting unanswered topics and tell everyone to downvote them.</p>

<p>At :50, the 2nd ambulance-type vehicle arrives.</p>

<p>At 2:30, the 1st one leaves.</p>

<p>After they leave, at 3:10, cowboy and the﻿ wheelchair crew come out of the crowd near the center of the screen, heading to the bottom of the screen. They are not trailing blood. They stop to adjust the fake leg, getting ready for their photo op. This is over three minutes in, at double speed. So, over 6 minutes after the explosion, after the ambulances leave, this guy with his legs supposedly blown off gets rolled out in a wheelchair.</p>

<p>(At 3:05, another &quot;victim&quot; is unloaded from the black van into a wheelchair.)</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying the scene was clearly staged.   What Denise Richard&#39;s role was, I cannot say.   Besides the symbolism, what else is wrong with this photo (hint.. look at the tie above and below the string)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would that photo even be photoshopped in the way you&#39;re suggesting? What sense does that make - they just happened to have a photo of the kid holding his hands out like that but thought it was a good idea to put in a banner with his name on it?</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with the photo - it is slightly overexposed (a white suit will do that) but the line of the tie continues consistently from the knot, past the string. There is also a shadow near the knot that initially appears to be the edge of the tie, but it&#39;s fairly easy to see that it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>You&#39;re proposing that this kid, who went to school and did other kid things, known by dozens or even hundreds of other kids and adults, is dead now, but may not have been as a result of the bomb. So he just happened to die around the same time (so no one noticed he was gone before the bombing) which then conveniently allowed his bereaved family to take part in some gigantic secret plot?</p>

<p>That same plot also involved a number of other crisis actors including a double amputee to portray Jeff Bauman who, before the bombings, had two legs but now doesn&#39;t? And not only all those anonymous crisis actors but also a prominent and very well known anti-war activist?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know that they did.  One possibility mentioned is that parts of it were done with bluescreen composite in a studio.  Bystanders were cleared out of the actual areas REAL fast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>please check your assumptions.</p>

<p>his mother, his sister.. where are they?  not easy to see if they are actors or not.   there&#39;s no reason they couldn&#39;t be invented identities.</p>

<p>the woman in the video on the street.  you assume she lives there?  the photos?  don&#39;t show anything, some people hugging and a girl looking sad out front of a house.   what was their address?  </p>

<p>names of victims.. I can also write 53 names down.   Better yet, give me a pentagon budget and I&#39;ll invent a self consistent 400 person town.. Not a problem.   Everyone will vouch for everyone else.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see any inconsistency with the staged scenario hypothesis in this.</p>
