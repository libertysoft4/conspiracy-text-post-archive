        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Preface:
Albert Pike writes a letter to Mazzini, dated August 15, 1871. This letter graphically outlined plans for three world wars that were seen as necessary to bring about the One World Order, and we can marvel at how accurately it has predicted events that have already taken place.
*Not my original content</p>

<p>&quot;The First World War must be brought about in order to permit the Illuminati to overthrow the power of the Czars in Russia and of making that country a fortress of atheistic Communism. The divergences caused by the &quot;agentur&quot; (agents) of the Illuminati between the British and Germanic Empires will be used to foment this war. At the end of the war, Communism will be built and used in order to destroy the other governments and in order to weaken the religions.&quot; 2
Students of history will recognize that the political alliances of England on one side and Germany on the other, forged between 1871 and 1898 by Otto von Bismarck, co-conspirator of Albert Pike, were instrumental in bringing about the First World War.
&quot;The Second World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences between the Fascists and the political Zionists. This war must be brought about so that Nazism is destroyed and that the political Zionism be strong enough to institute a sovereign state of Israel in Palestine. During the Second World War, International Communism must become strong enough in order to balance Christendom, which would be then restrained and held in check until the time when we would need it for the final social cataclysm.&quot; 3
After this Second World War, Communism was made strong enough to begin taking over weaker governments. In 1945, at the Potsdam Conference between Truman, Churchill, and Stalin, a large portion of Europe was simply handed over to Russia, and on the other side of the world, the aftermath of the war with Japan helped to sweep the tide of Communism into China.<br/>
(Readers who argue that the terms Nazism and Zionism were not known in 1871 should remember that the Illuminati invented both these movements.  In addition, Communism as an ideology, and as a coined phrase, originates in France during the Revolution.  In 1785, Restif coined the phrase four years before revolution broke out.  Restif and Babeuf, in turn, were influenced by Rousseau - as was the most famous conspirator of them all, Adam Weishaupt.)
&quot;The Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the &quot;agentur&quot; of the &quot;Illuminati&quot; between the political Zionists and the leaders of Islamic World. The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel) mutually destroy each other. Meanwhile the other nations, once more divided on this issue will be constrained to fight to the point of complete physical, moral, spiritual and economical exhaustion…We shall unleash the Nihilists and the atheists, and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil. Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction, anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out in the public view. This manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately I&#39;m with DarkBourbon on this one, except it wasn&#39;t exactly perpetrated by &quot;freemasons&quot; per say. </p>

<p>I also thought this was a legit quote too, but a little research exposes it as a hoax, likely carried out by the notorious <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Taxil">Léo Taxil</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/Articles/Pike-Mazzini_Three-World-Wars.htm">This article pretty much lays out why this is a hoax</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://wideshut.co.uk/albert-pikes-3-world-wars-letter-hoax-wideshut-webcast/">Here is another</a>.</p>

<p>Similar quotes have been made up about Lincoln, Otto von Bismarck, and tons of other major political figures.</p>

<p>In fact, I own a beautiful copy of Morals and Dogma by Pike printed in the 40&#39;s. You&#39;d think that if he had such a brilliant insight like predicting three world wars he would bother to add a sentence about that in his magnum opus.</p>

<p>However, the mere fact that this is such a pervasive myth is a conspiracy in itself. Clearly this purported letter has been around for a long time, so <em>whoever</em> came up with this had some serious connections...these predictions go beyond merely being incredibly astute.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So it&#39;s a <em>hoax</em> perpetrated by a man that died before any of the predictions came to be. While maybe not as extraordinary as if Pike had said it, it&#39;s still quite amazing and should hardly be discounted as just a hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually if you trace the sources back the original &quot;letter&quot; which was hoaxed, it made no mention of 3 world wars, zionists, Nazis or anything of the sort. It was about the destruction of catholicism. The 3 world war part of the hoax was added after word war 2, so the only real prediction is the 3rd world war, and this was never actually a direct quote from the &quot;letter&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, not only does his vision of the multitudes becoming disillusioned with Christianity they are also meant to turn away from atheism. To create a new religion based on the &quot;pure doctrine of Lucifer&quot;.  </p>

<p>So not only is it a plan of purely sinister proportions they want to remove the belief of unbelief to believe solely in Lucifer/Satan.   &quot;Isn&#39;t that speeeeciaaaal..!&quot; -Church Lady</p>

<p>As someone who has wrestled with faith and been on all sides of the argument for and against the belief in a greater force of power than just myself I find it almost spiritually encouraging to know that the true revolution that ourselves as human beings can participate in is that of a spiritual revolution. They want us to follow their plans because they realize that spiritual degeneration makes for more easily controlled masses.  </p>

<p>Great post OP!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm. Faith is not power. It is an admission that you can not handle behaving as if you are a rational actor. Your own self control has been replaced by a threat from...what exactly? I don&#39;t need the sedation and coercion of faith to be a decent person. It is telling that you do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you are trying to say,  and that it is a convenient shoehorn to try and belittle someone who was just being honest with their own experience. </p>

<p>The only thing that is &#39;telling&#39; is your ignorance to the concept that everybody on earth deals with faith, even in its most theologically removed manifestations.  </p>

<p>For faith at its most purest definition simply means to trust.  Haven&#39;t we all had moments where there is only so much we know or have experience with something that the rest of it resides on our otherwise blind trust in taking the next step. </p>

<p>Putting trust in something is definitely NOT an admission that one cannot be rational. I don&#39;t know where you got that from, but that is completely backwards.</p>

<p>For example, stepping up on an old ladder and trusting that it will hold our weight.  That is pretty much all faith is, its having trust in something. Whether for you that translates into a deity or whatever it is still something that every body has come in contact with.  I am an agnostic, and intelligent enough to not completely write off faith as a word or even a concept. </p>

<p>Free thought is all about keeping your mind open to all things. For a person who is closed and stubborn about the little things can never appreciate nor see the truth in the greater things.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which, if you see what&#39;s going on at the moment; Russia siding with Syria(Assad) and America, again siding with Israel. The proxy war which is being fought there and how a regional war could be in the process of igniting. This could very well be what is being said in this &#39;prediction&#39;. </p>

<p>The regional war will pull in more and more countries that believe one side is more correct than the other and so have larger and larger disputes over what to do. This then has the potential to create a war in which a good majority if not all of the worlds military powers face off against each other. </p>

<p>This would be then classed as a World War that started over the destruction of Islam and Zionism.</p>

<p>P.s. I am not saying that I fully believe this &#39;prediction&#39; as one of us could easily write the same and portray it as an old text. Though it does give a very startling outlook and possibly accurate account of what is happening, and why. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While i agree with you, i also recognize that two wars have been defined as such. I imagine another war could be defined as a world war by the same logic. Arbitrary or not, if 90% of humanity calls it such, then i think we can assume it is in fact a world war. I believe that anything that is widely enough recognized can be defined as its recognition, aside from textbook definitions. Many examples of this exist already. Two sides to every coin if you know what i mean.</p>
