<p>I believe this will usher in the beginning of disarmament. It&#39;s basically going to be an armed stand-off between a militia and the government. If 1 idiot fires on officers, they will mow down the crowd with no remorse, and new gun legislation will be written in record time.</p>

<p>I&#39;m almost feeling as if Adam is being coerced into doing it and that he should know better than this.</p>

<p>The government knows that we have guns and would fight for our rights to keep them, but this gives them a reasoning to say that guns are irrational weapons of war and deserve no place on our streets.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be watching, and praying that I&#39;m wrong.</p>

<p>More like if 1 idiot cop fires. </p>

<p>What exactly about thousands of <em>armed</em> civilians marching makes the government look bad? It makes it appear that anyone who owns a gun is an irresponsible anarchist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because marching in a peaceful protest, which is legally permitted in our constitution, makes us into irresponsible anarchists? I think your perspective is a little skewed here.</p>

<p>Personally, I think that Kokesh is onto something, whether it turns out to be a massive PR failure or national crisis is yet to be determined. Kokesh has demonstrated plenty of times that he is non-violent, so I don&#39;t see the activists being the first to shoot.</p>

<p>A friend of mine and I were discussing how ingenious it would be if Kokesh and the rest of the protesters <em>lied</em> about loading their weapons, and marched with empty guns. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get why you might think that, but I&#39;m not suggesting they&#39;re irresponsible anarchists, I&#39;m proposing that is the way the media will portray them.</p>

<p>And <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/206017/president-obama-signs-anti-protest-bill-h-r-347/">this</a> bill very well may have made it illegal.</p>

<p>In regards to actually marching with unloaded weapons, that would be a very smart move to enrage the public if the cops were to actually open fire.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the possibility that the cops send one of their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_provocateur">agents</a> in to cause trouble.</p>

<p>This is all the MORE reason that the citizenry have to assert their 2nd amendment rights to bear arms and form militias.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>These really are desperate and tense times we live in right now.  Things are really beginning to strain.  As such, the responses that are required by the citizenry cannot be those that a corporatocracy that is THIS close to taking away what few freedoms we have left will disregard and <em>not</em> take seriously.  It seems that considering the current stakes, there might not be all that many things <em>other</em> than the type of response Kokesh advocates that would be taken seriously be the current system.</p>

<p>Exactly.  This is agreed.  I understand you have great, great reticence about it, but I&#39;m not sure that protecting the 2nd Amendment has all too much of an alternative at this point.</p>

<p>And it is because of the TRUTH of this reality that we must face it head on and without fear so that we can actually SEE what it really and truly is.  Otherwise, if we keep our heads stuck in the sand like veritable ostriches, then TPTB will continue being as nefarious and manipulative as they&#39;ve always been WITHOUT being checked and without the counter resistance that should be had by the citizenry upon them.</p>

<p>So we need to CRUSH THE FUCK BACK, GOD DAMMIT.  Understand that.  Don&#39;t be a fucking weakling coward.  You&#39;re going to die anyway as far as they&#39;re concerned.  You&#39;re either going to die with a PTB dick stuck firmly in your ass or you&#39;re going to die <em>fucking FIGHTING</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swampstallionfishingadventures.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/never-give-up-frog.jpg">So then die fighting God dammit.  Die fighting.</a></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If we are being given no choice in protecting our selves - and it seems we are quickly approaching that - then we need to face the music and fight back with honor, focus, and courage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remember, the public absorbs anything that comes through their TV as absolute truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t say that because it&#39;s not true.  A large enough portion of the public, unfortunately, certainly seem to, but not ALL of the public.  Not everyone.  I certainly don&#39;t.  I don&#39;t even own a television and haven&#39;t owned one in over thirteen years.  A large minority of the public DON&#39;T regard what the MSM says as absolute truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the media paints Kokesh as some Anti-American government rebel, the public will not feel any sorrow if he is dealt with, and his cause will be <strong>greatly</strong> diminished. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Independent media and news coverage is more powerful now than ever.  That needs to be stepped up too, and this could possibly counteract the MSM bs - at least to some extent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just like, for example, Occupy Wallstreet. Great idea, because Bankers are ruining this country before everyone&#39;s eyes, but misguided and publicly disregarded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s indeed a great example, unfortunately.  I wouldn&#39;t even say that it BEGAN &quot;misguided&quot; however.  I think it started correctly, but was quickly co-opted and infiltrated and in THAT way it was disbanded.</p>

<p>What you say is very valid.  But, my man, we have NO CHOICE.  We either get our shit together as a people and fight back honorably and intelligently - whether that fighting be non violent, peaceful resistance, or armed resistance via warfare - or continue to be taken over like the sheep that we continue acting like.</p>

<p>Yep.  It takes a very informed public to see through the lies and know it&#39;s all chicanery.  Unfortunately, TPTB value the dumbing down of the masses more and more, and their efforts are succeeding.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yep.  Again, it takes a <em>very</em> informed public to see through the lies and know it&#39;s all chicanery.  Part of the fight and war that we need to wage against TPTB involves a war against ignorance; a war to wake everyone up with information and education so that less and less people fall for the b.s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You and I are not the &quot;average American.&quot;</p>

<p>I wish we were in the sense that more of us realized that what&#39;s happening in this country and world is mostly all nefarious manipulation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I cannot disagree much with this, sir.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Out of the 300 million Americans, how many really know what&#39;s going on? THAT is what I&#39;m trying to get at.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand what you&#39;re saying better now.  However, the points that I myself made still stand.  Whether we are informed or ignorant, TPTB are <em>still</em> going through with their caustic plans, and there will come a point (and soon, it seems) when even the ignorant will not in any discernible way be able to deny any longer what the real truth is.  The key is to get them to understand this while there&#39;s still a chance to actually DO something about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The American people by and large have no chance against the US government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is truly sad...and possibly sadly true.  However, the way I see it, even if I myself am literally the ONLY ONE fighting against TPTB (and I know I wouldn&#39;t be), even if I know I would have no chance and would soon get &quot;Christopher Dornered&quot;, I still don&#39;t think that I would be sitting too idly by and do nothing when SHTF.</p>

<p>I know that most people would likely do nothing because they&#39;re either too ignorant to, or too scared to.  However, I would rather encourage action amongst the people than encourage a type of mindset that generally says &quot;Well, there will likely be nothing we can do against them, so we shouldn&#39;t even try really.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The gov is too powerful and too influential (through MSM) to ever topple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See that&#39;s where I cannot disagree more.  Hell this COUNTRY was founded by people who went against those many who a couple of centuries ago said &quot;The king/monarchy is too powerful and too influential to ever topple.&quot;</p>

<p>Now the current despotic monarchy has traveled to <em>this</em> country.  It&#39;s simply time to do it all over again and, again, fight for real independence of the people against the rule of the elite.</p>

<p>You know what seems to be happening?  It seems to be a cyclical revolution all over again.  What&#39;s happening right now with the people starting to get REALLY fed the f$%ck up w/TPTB in this land sounds pretty similar to what happened 238-240 years ago when the people on the other side of the pond started getting pretty fed the f$%ck up w/the way TPTB were acting then.</p>

<p>They eventually did something about it then.  It, again, might be time to pick up the mantle once more and change the pretty horrible state that the status quo has devolved into here as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are too many naive people who believe because we live in America that tyranny could never happen here, and because of that will always side with the gov&#39;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  It seems this way.  Those people will become fewer and fewer as SHTF more and more, however.  Again, the hope is that they will REALLY wake up before the SHTF so hard that it actually <em>breaks</em> the fan and nothing can be done about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So when you and I and whoever else is informed and brave enough stand up for ourselves and our rights, the media will paint us as extremists who hate the government that are a threat to the public at large.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well...at this point, I wouldn&#39;t quite yet say that I &quot;hate&quot; this government, but I&#39;m not too far away from it, so if, hypothetically-speaking, I was accused of such (say, here on Reddit, for example), I&#39;d simply let it be known WHY I am very critical of the U.S.  If I&#39;m still called an &quot;extremist&quot; after that, then I&#39;d say &quot;Okay.  If being labeled an &#39;extremist&#39; is what you call someone who is very, very critical of the current policy of this country, then call me an extremist.  I stand accused and am in no way problemed by that.&quot;</p>

<p>Preachers lead congregations all the time. WWI veterans marched on Washington during the Depression. The Million Man March was a successful event. The Tea Party had some events in DC too.</p>

<p>If you want to send a message, do it. Walking into DC with open carry is a bad idea.</p>

<p>Really, chamaelleon? Are you going to depose the government? How charming. You might want to save for your funeral.</p>

<p>If you recall from history class, the American Revolution was fought because they were victims of <em>taxation without representation</em>. You have representation. You have elected officials. You have a functioning political process through which you can achieve policy ends.</p>

<p>The government sucks, but it hasn&#39;t &quot;gone rogue.&quot; It&#39;s designed to aid the few at the expense of the many. This countermajoritarian problem is not, however, the rightful target of a coup.</p>

<p>Since the passage of Citizens United, the candidate who spends the most money on their election campaign has gotten elected 85-93% of the time, at both the state and federal levels (politifacts). That is a statistically overwhelming figure that says quite plainly &#39;our government is a plutocracy.&#39; Money is equal to free speech, and is now buying political power and legislative results. Since I am not rich, I am NOT represented anymore in this country. This is not MY government anymore, and unless you&#39;re in the .1% of the wealthiest people in this country, you are not represented either. That is not how our electoral system is supposed to function. </p>

<p>And, yes, the government has gone rogue, as of march 16th, 2012, when Obama signed executive order 13603. Never heard of it? Well, it&#39;s just a little piece of paper that says the executive branch has the right to seize any and all resources deemed necessary for the continuity of government (including forced human labor), during PEACETIME or times of national emergency. No congressional approval is required, and the authority of the order is not subjectable to judicial review, meanign the executive branch has seceded from the checks and balances of the other two branches. Read it yourself if you don&#39;t believe me. It&#39;s on whitehouse.gov under the title National Defense Resource Preparedness. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/">Yes you are</a>. At the state level too.</p>

<p>Safe seats are caused by decennial redistricting and gerrymandering at the state level. Citizens United is not the cause for that problem, which is as old as democracy itself. The term gerrymandering dates to 1815.</p>

<p>Citizens United certainly has a role, but that&#39;s about independent expenditures. I.e., expenditures not by the parties. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood want to spend money on political ads too, and they need for money to be recognized as free speech in order to do so. If I want to buy a billboard, then I need money to be speech to do so.</p>

<p>13603 is certainly disconcerting use of Executive power, but you&#39;re saying it provides the justification for a coup which deposes the leadership of the country?! That is fucking insane. It&#39;s basically a restatement of Executive branch authority from decades ago.</p>

<p>It is not and will never be the justification for a coup.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>13603 is not a re-itteration of the 1950 Defense Production Act, it expands it. The 1950s legislation granted the authority to seize resources during war times <em>only,</em> which required congressional approval. <em>And</em> the authority in the original Act was subjectable to judicial review. There is an enormous difference betwen having authority that can be checked and having authority that <em>cannot</em> be chekced. It&#39;s the differnce between a democracy and a dictatorship. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t think that the executive branch separating itself from checks and balances, and granting itself the authority to forcibly seize your assets and toss you in a labor camp during <em>peacetime</em> is reason enough to overthrow the government, then what exactly <em>would</em> you consider reason enough? Do you think they just draw up paperwork like that for fun? No, they anticipate using it, and I refuse to sit around and wait for that to happen. </p>

<p>As for Citizen&#39;s United, it has far greater implications than you seem to realize. If gerrymandering were the main problem, then we would have seen statistics about candidates who manipulate district lines winning 85-93% of the time, but we didn&#39;t (which is not to say it isn&#39;t a problem, just not nearly as big a problem). But we started seeing those figures associated to candidates who spend the most money after Citizen&#39;s United because of how overwhelming the affect is of calling money free speech. Good for the ACLU and Planned Parenthood for being able to buy political speech now, but what about all the people who don&#39;t have money to spend on their right to speak? That legislation doesn&#39;t just open doors for people with money, it closes doors for people without it, because there is a limited amount of time and space for political advertisement. And, in concert with the repeal of Glass-Steagall, we can&#39;t even see where that money is coming from, or where it&#39;s going, until it&#39;s too late. </p>

<p>Pointing out the name of my &quot;representatives&quot; does nothing for me. If those guys were representing the will of the people, the background check bill would have just passed, GMOs would be labeled, and Citizen&#39;s United would have been repealed long ago. On all three of those issues, and numerous others, polling indicated very high public support for the course of action I mentioned for each, and yet none of those actions were taken by &quot;our&quot; legislators. Because &quot;free speech&quot; was thrown at them and they chose to represent their own financial interrests instead of the people&#39;s will. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether you think the Tea Party or Occupy Wall Street is more right in their conclusions about the problems in American government, the solution is more democratic participation. Not a suicide mission to overthrow the government. Almost every successful coup in history was led by people even less scrupulous than those they deposed. So, I&#39;m not going to waste my time debating this with someone who thinks a coup is a viable solution. I&#39;ll be brief:</p>

<p>Your position on 13603 is paranoid. Excesses by the Executive Branch will be held in check by Congress and the Supreme Court, as they always have been.</p>

<p>What you fail to understand is that Citizens United protects your right to speak and buy advertising space to air your view. Not alone, of course, where the financial burden is too great, but in concert with like-minded people. Gerrymandering is one problem, but the larger problem which is less known is the creation of <em>safe seats</em> through the action of bipartisan gerrymandering. Through this, Ds and Rs at the state level agree to protect certain seats, thus putting fewer seats in contention.</p>

<p>This problem precedes Citizens United in time and exceeds it in severity. It&#39;s the way that bipartisan panels draw district lines to create safe seats - not with respect to public interest but as a cartel - which is the primary factor which makes seats safe.</p>

<p>And, more to the point, that problem is not less or more changeable than Citizens United. Both would require massive political reform initiated by widespread activity in voter registration and citizen action.</p>

<p>NOT A FUCKING COUP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All laws should be extended <em>ad absurdum</em> (to absurd proportions) in order to see what their fullest extent entails. It&#39;s not important what we <em>think</em> a law will be used for; it&#39;s important what it&#39;s <em>possible</em> to use it for. Power needs to be checked pro-actively, not re-actively, wherever possible, and especially on such critical issues as the seizure of all resources including human labor. </p>

<p>Now, you either didn&#39;t read 13603 or you aren&#39;t understanding what it details. Congress and the Judicial branch <em>cannot</em> check its authorities. Here&#39;s why: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Sec. 104.  Implementation.  (a)  The National Security Council and Homeland Security Council, in conjunction with the National Economic Council, shall serve as the integrated policymaking forum for consideration and formulation of national defense resource preparedness policy...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>What this section does is establish 3 councils in charge of deciding when the executive branch has the right to seize resources (not Congress). <em>All 3 councils are under the jurisdiction of the executive branch,</em> which means they only need their own permission to use this authority...again, during peacetime if they want. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Sec. 804.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>This section uses tricky wording to exempt the order from judicial review. The word &quot;construe&quot; has a very specific legal usage. It means to interpret the law. And it is very specifically the auspices of the Supreme Court to interpret the law. This is the key aspect of judicial review. So this section prevents the Supreme Court from interpreting the meaning of the executive order in any way that inhibits the decisions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. If you look up that position, it is another executive branch position (cabinet member); the one in charge of assisting the President in allocating the use of funds within the executive branch. So if the President and the Director of OMB decide that we need to allocate resources to seize more resources, the courts can&#39;t do anything to get in the way of that decision. </li>
</ul>

<p>Are you beginning to see why this order is so dangerous? And why it is effectively a secession of the executive branch from the system of checks and balances? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When or if the Executive uses 13603 beyond his powers, citizens and more likely Congress will challenge that use of executive action. The Supreme Court can review the action to see that it does not violate separation of powers and related principles of constitutional law. Or, in the case of seizure, that such seizures did not occur without just compensation pursuant to the 5th Amendment.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not exempt from judicial review. Marbury v Madison place the authority for review in the Constitutionally-empowered Article III federal courts, as you noted. An Executive Order cannot, by fiat, countermand the Constitution. If it did, it would present a constitutional crisis.</p>

<p>There is a question, however, of whether the Judiciary will permit a challenge to executive action, or it would permit some action because it lacks enforcement power (such as with foreign relations). There&#39;s ample precedent to show that Article III courts are willing to interfere with executive actions on domestic matters.</p>

<p>I.e., with separation of powers issues and seizures/ just compensation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As for Citizen&#39;s United, I think you are failing to see that, because advertising time and space are limited, what it also does is protect the right of people with more money than me to buy up all the advertising space so that I have no voice at all. If advertising time and space were not limited, then CU would effectively give us all the right to buy a voice, but since it is limited, and there is competition for advertising opportunities, it bottlenecks political speech and drives up the price of being heard. Drive up the price enough and poor people can no longer speak. </p>

<p>We may disagree on whether gerrymandering or CU is a more egregious bit of politicking, but your assertion that gerrymandering is worse does not do anything for your argument that I am being proportionally represented in government. If anything, it supports my argument that I am not being represented as I should be. It&#39;s just one more of thousands of tricks they use to take my voice away. </p>

<p>While I agree that massive reform and a massive increase in democratic participation would be one effective way to rememdy all this mess, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s realistic to expect that. And not because people are lazy and uninterrested, but because most people are too busy trying to put food on the table. When all it takes to ennact harmful legislation is slipping it into an existing bill that&#39;s almost certain to pass, yet to repeal it requires hundreds of thousands of people setting aside their lives to march and protest, something is very wrong. Something which cannot be fixed by working from within the system. Even if we were successful at organizing enough people to get citizen&#39;s united repealed, or campaign financing reformed, the beauraucrats would just sneak ten more loopholes into law in the meantime, to accomplish the same thing. It&#39;s too easy for them to take away our liberty, and too difficult for us to get it back. We may as well be trying to dig a hole in water. </p>

<p>No, this system needs to be collapsed, either through non-participation or violent revolt. I&#39;ve advocated non-violent non-participation for years, but things have only gotten worse. It can&#39;t be accomplished from within the system anymore. We have to move outside of it and establish a new system. </p>

<p>But there are more than 300 million people in this country. Voter registration and turnout are very low even among those who are eligible, and even in years for federal elections. Activating the sleeping American body politic also means activating their collective resources to ad buying. Even without ad-buying, they can be activated through the web and other related resources.</p>

<p>You are being represented in government, but not necessarily well-represented. Or fairly represented. Still, each representative serves on behalf of a roughly proportional amount of people (equiproportionality is a protected right, consistent with One Man, One Vote). Your vote is as powerful as the person in the mansion on the hill. But, it&#39;s his wallet which is more powerful. The votes are equal because of the Constitution, and his speech is free because of the 1st Amendment/ Citizens United. Ultimately, that means citizens have to turn off the TV and get their shit together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think voter participation is low because the people are all asleep. Certainly that is the case for many of them. But I think a strong argument can be made that many people have simply withdrawn from the political process because they do not think their vote makes any difference anymore. Like people who have campaigned and voted for third-party candidates. The have <em>never</em> won an election. Or people who side with the majority on issues like GMO labeling, background chekcs for firearm permits, repealing CU, legalizing weed, banning private prisons, or reforming the lobbying and political contribution process. These people have long been in the majority in their desire to change these issues, yet they have been routed at all turns. If we are a representative democracy, then all of those issues <em>should</em> have gone along with the will of the people. None of them have, and there comes a point when we begin to feel that we are wasting tour breath. Only the insane can continue to do the same thing over and over, while expecting different results. </p>

<p>More than 60% of this country&#39;s wealth sits in the pockets of less than 5% of its populace. So even 95% of us joining our money together <em>still</em> could not stop the other 5% from buying our representatives. They simply have too much money. Plus they <em>own</em> most of the advertising venues. It simply is not possible to compete with that. So I say our options <em>are</em> exhausted. The system has been rigged so that change cannot be affected from within legal channels. Which means we have to go outside legal channels to affect change. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not that I&#39;m fed up or at my wits end, so I&#39;m ready to pick up a gun and start shooting my frustration away. It&#39;s that, logically, there is no other way out. How do you change a corrupt government, legally, when affecting that change requires money you don&#39;t have? It&#39;s a catch 22. </p>

<p>If you have a viable suggestion, I would seriously consider it...but a greater level of involvement is not a viable solution, for the reasons I just outlined. I&#39;m not a person who relishes the idea of violence. Unlike many &#39;Muricans, I condemn, rather than glorify it. Having to pick up a gun is, to me, the ultimate failure. So I will gladly hear any other rational possibilities... I just have not heard any, and I am unwilling to sit idly by and watch my future, and <em>your</em> future torn to shreds by those who have been corrupted by power and wealth. They are treading on my dreams, and &#39;though it will kill a dear part of me to do it, I will kill them if I have to, to put a stop to it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there&#39;s substantial overlap in our thinking and our concerns, but <em>certainly not</em> in the solutions.

Half of me is thinking that you&#39;re not really making this argument in good faith, but rather you&#39;ve become radicalized because you&#39;ve given up on activist political solutions.</p>

<p>Your frustration is noted, but the principle enshrined in the Declaration of Independence is that taking arms against government finds justification only where the political means have been utterly exhausted. That, too, is a morally upstanding and pacifist principle I can believe in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.</p>

<p>You can debate <em>when</em> that point becomes necessary, but it isn&#39;t yet because the political and activist solutions are not exhausted. That point is not even close.</p>

<p>This is actually correct, and anyone that is afraid of that tension (like OP) actually prevents and retards that eventual, inevitable resolution.</p>

<p>I support his action and, even though it may very well end VERY ugly, I hope he and his group don&#39;t back down.  I hope win loose or draw it sends a message of solidarity throughout all the citizenry to hold fast to their/our rights - especially our 2nd Amendment rights.</p>

<p>You sound like someone who is more willing to simply let the government keep fucking and fucking us without doing anything or having any response until they disarm the population ANYWAY.  That&#39;s what they&#39;re planning regardless of a Kokesh demonstration or not.  I&#39;d prefer a wake up call given to the people of the US so that they know 100% that this government sucks and is NOT in the business of helping the citizenry.

<p>Yes.  You&#39;re right.  These are all good points you bring up.  There are a LOT of sheep.  Seems the only thing those that are closer to the truth can do is keep digging.  I don&#39;t think that we should give up trying to open eyes up even though it might seem pointless.</p>
