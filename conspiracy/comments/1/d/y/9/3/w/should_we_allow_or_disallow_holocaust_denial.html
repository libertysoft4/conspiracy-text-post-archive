<p>Hitting someone in the face has nothing to do with free speech.</p>

<p>Just out of curiousity ... are you vaguely aware there is currently an ongoing genocide in Palestine, a &quot;Palestinian Holocaust&quot; funded in great parts with US dollars that should be dealt with, or is the Jewish one that happened 70 years ago <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80GgRWuXcO8&amp;amp;list=PL846A286E45675E86&amp;amp;index=1">with lots of propaganda included</a>  the only one that matters to you?</p>

<p>Downvotes will pour, but if you take time to watch the video you will see for yourself many of the facts that make no sense.  People have been brainwashed into throwing out any form of critical thinking when it comes to this touchy subject.  </p>

<p>Sorry for not believing everything I was taught.  Sorry for caring more about the current ongoing US-paid genocide/holocaust in Palestine than the one that happened nearly 70 years ago and is still being paid for.</p>

<p>I expect the usual response of being called an asshole, ignorant, etc. by people that will give me reference to NY times articles and no valid counter-arguments to the claim that the event is filled with propaganda and half-truths that are still taught in schools today around Israel supporting countries while many historians have even backed down on the claims of mass exterminations with gas-chambers.</p>

<p>I do not deny there was any suffering, that no one was killed.  I feel for the surviving family members and truly believe even one death in a conflict is one too many. The crimes against Palestine is just another example of the brain-washed hypocrisy of the west when it comes to the Zionist agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many things are hidden in plain sight.  Walk around, and ask your fellow countrymen how they feel about the situation in Palestine.</p>

<p>Some won&#39;t have a clue. Others will say &#39;damn Arabs &#39;n terr&#39;rists deserve the shit they get. Yet others will justify it saying they are always attacking Israel (with sticks and stones need I remind you).</p>

<p>The majority of the populace is quite clueless on what&#39;s happening outside their hometown and respective countries. </p>

<p>Sure, some are waking up and maybe just maybe at some point we can hope the awakened ones will reach a high enough number to actually bring on some change, but time is running out. And the censoring and laws are getting harsher day by day. Drones will soon be patroling over U.S.A, enforcing laws that prevent any criticism of those in power.</p>

<p>You -do- realize they have rockets, right? And that they actually have weapons? Not the Palestinian people, but Hamas? Who fire the rockets constantly into Israel then use their own people as shields when Israel tries to take out the launch sites so they can exploit their deaths to make Israel look worse then they already are?</p>

<p>Also what does the second half have to do with the situation in Gaza and Israel?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh boy. &quot;Rockets&quot;.  How many Israeli casualties are we talking about?</p>

<p><a href="http://mondoweiss.net/2012/11/dissecting-idf-propaganda-the-numbers-behind-the-rocket-attacks.html">26 casualties since the past 10 years</a>. Most of those deaths occurred during Israeli invasions of Palestinian territories, condemend by a shit-load of (ignored) bull-shit UN resolutions let us not forget.</p>

<p><a href="http://middleeast.about.com/b/2009/07/24/israel-bans-al-naqba-from-textbooks.htm">Have you seen the Isreali map lately</a>?!?!?  What would you recommend the Palestinians do? Send flowers and hope for peace? Or maybe just wait until they are wiped out? Oh. Maybe they should turn to International court, or the UN to rid them of their oppressors? It seems International court was only useful for Nuremburg. The international laws meant to prevent genocide do not really apply for Palestinians, it seems. In fact, come to think of it ... International law is only applied when it serves western interests. </p>

<p>If your country was invaded and occupied in such a manner, would <strong>you</strong> be sending flowers and praying for peace, as your land and humand rights are stripped off slowly year after year? </p>

<p>Palestine, one of the poorest country in the world is a threat to Isreal, that boasts one of the most powerful armies in the world?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you actually read what I&#39;ve said, Hamas isn&#39;t good for Palestine either. They allow their own people to get killed to use as propaganda and they engineer their own people to get killed to do so. Yea, of course the rockets aren&#39;t as effective as they should be but they are still rockets being fired and still have a chance to kill people. Not to mention they&#39;ve been attacking Israel for decades from Palestine. If it hasn&#39;t been successful for decades, what makes you think it will be successful today?</p>

<p>So good on people like Steven Hawking and Amnesty to bring to light what&#39;s going on but bad on Hamas who exploit the deaths of their own people for propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did read what you said. I&#39;ll answer your pitiful rethoric, then let&#39;s see if you can answer mine. </p>

<p>Hamas is most often depicted in our zionist owned medias as a radical Islamic fundamentalist organization. They are also pointed to being <em>THE</em> major roadblock to the peace process. Truth is, Israel has no intention whatsoever of pursuing the peace process, Hamas has nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>Civilians have come to depend on Hamas that takes care of all basic services best they can in the occupied territories. This includes maintaining and rebuilding the administrational structures that are repeatedly targeted and destroyed. Taking care of schooling facilities, minimal as they may be and distributing food and minimal health care. Coordinating the various International aid groups that sometimes are allowed in Gaza.  They do have a military agenda, <em>as would any occupied / invaded country</em> and saying otherwise would be hypocrisy. </p>

<p>To further enlighten you on the current situation of Hamas, <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/167680#.UYyhFLWPONp">here is an article from last week</a> coming from a news source you would deem as being respectable seeing it is Isrealian.</p>

<p>Do take notice they are saying the organisation is maintaining peace and stop feeding me that propagandish bullshit. In other words, Hamas is no longer active militarily against Israel and without Hamas, Palestinian civilians would be totally left to their own plight. The world does not give a fuck about Palestine in case you have not noticed.</p>

<p>Now, your turn.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You did see <a href="http://www.thehypertexts.com/images/israel-palestine_map.jpg">the map</a>, right? </p></li>
<li><p>Considering they will be wiped off the map completely if this continues (this is the goal, after all), what should the Palestinians do?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I will be happy to hear your response on this. On a closing note, here is a <a href="http://www.thehypertexts.com/Albert%20Einstein%201948%20Letter%20New%20York%20Times%20Nakba.htm">link to a letter Albert Einstein wrote 55 years ago</a> to the New York Time.</p>

<p>While you are there, (if you bother to read this at all), take note of all the quotes made by various Isreali leaders and politiciens at the bottom of that page. Sickening if I may say so myself and not worthy of human behavior.</p>

<p>I ask again, and my question begs an answer, what would <strong><em>you</em></strong> do if your country was being wiped off the face of the map, all paid for by US dollars, while the whole world watches and does nothing?</p>

<p>People like you that believe in and promote the zionist propaganda are actually <strong><em>way</em></strong> more harmful to Palestinians than Hamas ever was.  People that fight for their freedom merit respect.  </p>

<p>Now that Hamas is keeping things quiet, let us see how fast Israel will put an end to building illegal settlements, let us see if they will dismantle and give back the land they stole as stated in <a href="http://www.ifamericansknew.org/stats/un.html">65 broken UN resolutions</a>. Palestine has none, in case you were curious.</p>

<p>Please. Don&#39;t forget to at least maybe try to answer my question. I don&#39;t really expect you to come up with a sensible answer. But hey, try and surprise me with something sensible. Let&#39;s see how you justify a modern day <del>genocide</del> holocaust this time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ihr.org/leaflets/denial.shtml">This page</a> has references/quotes from a few Jewish names.</p>

<p>David Irving is a Jew himself.  Google his videos, read his books you will have tons of info. This man has been cited by many other historians.  </p>

<p>Ernst Zundel also dared to question the 6 million. At his trial in Canada the Supreme Court had this to say &quot;THE TRUTH IS NO DEFENSE.&quot; For daring to question, he is in a German prison today. When the Jews say 6 million died then you had better beileve it OR ELSE!!! Haven´t you noticed that charges of &quot;hate crime&quot; only apply to Jews? Have you ever heard of an Italian, Japanese, and heaven forbid, a German, ever being the victim of hate crime?</p>

<p>Norman Finkelstein lost his proffesorship for exposing the &quot;Holocaust Industry&quot;.</p>

<p>In Russia alone Stalin killed over 20 million people during those years, many of them Jews. Yet Stalin has nowhere near the same coverage as Hitler.</p>

<p><a href="http://rense.com/general69/dim.htm">This page</a> shows - with verifiable references and pictures of the Aushwitz plaque how the numbers of Aushwitz death toll has been lowered over the years again and again... and again.</p>

<p>Why would this be?</p>

<p>We went from 6 millions to ... 135,000 to 140,000 according to Red Cross Tracing documents.  The plaque is now set at 1.5 millions. Quite a difference nonetheless.</p>

<p>I think 1 death is too many, I do not want to minimize the suffering of those people the point I am trying to make is ... why would they make us believe in the 6 millions magic number, when it was bullshit and made up long before the war?</p>

<p>I felt used and taken as a sucker by the people that educated me on this, everyone all around has believed everything blindly and questioning it makes one pass off as a heartless, despicable piece of shit.  Being a critical thinker should not bring this type of response. Nonetheless, I am sorry for having offended anyone that misunderstood the point I was trying to make.</p>

<p>I&#39;m only responding to your dismissal of The New York Times (read: one of the most respected papers in the world). That isn&#39;t an ad hominem attack because I&#39;m not saying your source discredits your argument, I&#39;m saying you using a far less well established source (or rather, a source established as unreliable) makes criticising the NYT hypocritical.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t the main purpose of documenting &quot;The Holocaust&quot; to make sure this never happens again? I remember hearing that slogan somewhere ... &quot;Never again&quot; ... I guess this only applied to one culture because I can surely see the Palestinian territories shrinking year after year ... their people being deprived of human dignity and hope, that after all ... we should all be entitled to.  Sorry if my opinions differ from the majority, I respect whatever you want to believe in, and understand not everyone has this attitude towards people that think differently.</p>

<p>A proper education with material from proper historians would probably swagger your opinion. <em>HINT - David Cole, David Irving</em></p>

<p>The history we learned in school is very questionable. </p>

<p>Holocaust is a term coined for a very specific agenda: To bring on guilt and shame to the masses in exchange of financial retributions. There have been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocides_in_history">many genocides in history</a>.  Why did the Jewish hardships merit a specific reserved word, that can not be used for other genocides?  Many of those massacres killed more people than the WWII tragedy. Colonialists killed over 100 million indians when we colonized North-America. Yet this is not and will never be talked about in great details in our school rooms. The people who decide what we are taught have an agenda.</p>

To outright deny the holocaust is an insult to the millions who died not only in the holocaust, but in every other genocide.

    <div class="md"><p>Friend.  Just a simple fact, to give you something to ponder.</p>

<p>Stalin, in WWII was ally. Joseph Stalin did not intentionally target Jews, but he did amass quite a large amount of killings. Stalin killed over 20 million people in his purges and five-year plans.  Look it up. Look up the Jewish holocaust in Wikipedia, you will notice the number has been brought down from 6 millions ( a pre-determined holy number) to around 1.5 millions.</p>

<p>Why do we NEVER hear about the 20 million Russians (many Jews in there too)? Why no financial retribution to Russian victims? Stalin killed many many times more people than Hitler ever has.  In Russia Stalin is still considered a hero by many of the older generation.</p>

<p>History is written by the victors, and this sub is so full of shills it&#39;s quite creepy. Notice how the downvotes pile up yet no one has any counter-arguments?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may of had a teacher that was insighful enough to tell you more than the educational program dictated, good for you but I can assure you I have never heard of any  highshool with anything that touches Russian history. I went to school in Northern B.C, the 4  kids I raised went to school in Quebec.  Never seen anything about Russia on the curriculum.</p>

<p>Everybody in the world knows 6 millions jews were killed in gas chambers by Germans.  The figure is made up, (we don&#39;t know how many jews were killed), and the gas chambers were not used to kill jews, this has been proven to be propaganda and historians no longer push this narrative. </p>

<p>Yet it is still taught, word for word as told above in every history book you pick up. Heck, the death count in academic book is going up, while reputed historians are bringing it down.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, much as the event was indeed very tragic and horrible, there is a genocide / holocaust going on right now that Stephen Harper himself is partially funding. Did they teach you about Palestine? How their territory is shrinking year after year bit by bit?</p>

<p>Maybe we could concentrate on not letting history repeat itself instead of bickering over things that happened 70 years ago while closing our eyes on the atrocities <strong><em>we</em></strong> are guilty of funding.</p>

<p>Questioning this event always brings this response. We are anti-semites, if we question a fact, we are insensible and deny the whole thing.  Read my comments and you will see for yourself I have stated many times that yes many jews were killed and it was a horrible event.</p>

<p>But the story was presented by the allies in a very deceiving manner.  6 million jews were not gassed at Aushwitz, contrary to what is still taught in our schools.  Listen to the videos yourself and figure it out for yourself if you want, the information is all there and both videos are made by jews so we cannot really pretend they are anti-semites.</p>

<p>6 millions jews, everyone knows this number yet no one remembers how many Americans died in WWII. How many Russians. How many Chinese (+20 millions).  The only number we remember is 6 million. I call bullshit and many others have too.</p>

<p>Anyways,  I have stated all the facts and David Irving (another Jew) documentaries is what got me thinking, I suggest you google him.</p>

<p>Being labeled a holocaust denier and an anti-semite is about the only counter arguments these people can spew. Yet I am neither anti-semite nor a Holocaust denier. I am an avid reader of history who started to get interested in hoaxes in history and this is a major one.<br/>
If believing between 750 000 and 1.5 million people died in Aushwitz  instead of 6 millions makes me a holocaust denier and an anti-semite, so be it. No one countered the facts  because the information has already been debunked and the 6 million figure is a myth, as are the gas chambers supposedly used for mass extermination.  Does this make me a holocaust denier? Watch the vids and see for yourself how some Jews have lied their ass off. And they still do to this day in all our history books.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because he is discredited does not mean he is wrong.  Read his books, or watch his documentaries.  He is actually one of the only living historians to have interviewed German officers that were close to Hitler, interviewed many Jews, wrote many books and articles detailing the joke that we call the &quot;Nuremburg trial&quot;. </p>

<p>The Zionists have destroyed the man, but his work lives on.  Read up on the subject with an open mind and look up the facts, you will find history was presented to us in a very distorted manner.  I know my view is not popular as it goes against all we have been taught, and please do not think I am racist because I could not care less about Jews, I even have some close Jewish friends. Of course the man was not popular he was pointing out all the lies the allies laid down as history. Many historians have even given up on the famous &quot;gas chamber killings&quot; because of his very hard to rebute proofs.  The gas chambers were de-loussing chambers to kill lice, that was the main cause of typhus.  The &quot;extermination camps&quot; were in fact work camps, to assist in the war effort.  This is today acknowledged by many other historians, yet the original story lives on because it sounds better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you are saying the genocide was used to forward an ongoing political goal, I don&#39;t think anyone denies that either. Every single politician worth their salt can use any success or tragedy to advance their previous positions. On a smaller scale, with all the public shootings, democrats are using those things to further their agenda.</p>

<p>I think another reason it gets more publicity than other is first it was recorded to some degree in films and pictures, there are still people living who participated. That makes for better documentary and television. I&#39;m assuming that since we&#39;re speaking in English you&#39;re either in north american or Europe. All of the books and documentaries tend to be based, western perceptions, WWII was a pretty earth shattering event, I&#39;m sure there is was a desire to learn all aspects.</p>

<p>Another reason this one gets more publicity is because for examples the Stalin purges, Mao&#39;s death march, Cambodia... most of them tend to in countries that limit access to the west, and are events that for many years were still actively being denied.</p>

<p><strong>TL:DR</strong>  Jewish people had good PR reps, were able to classify genocide as holocost, used suffering in the war to advance their political agenda, like every other government in the world.</p>

<p>The world Holocaust becoming a proper noun makes sense, it was used to describe massacres before, I&#39;m sure in one or two hundres years after another massive genocide, the events during WWII night lost its proper noun status.</p>

<p>Just seeing the mass downvotes my comments triggered is a good enough proof that many people deny anything that counters the &quot;official&quot; story. Especially in this sub, where many are aware that Zionism has been at the center of many political ploys, do you not find this surprising that most posts that scratch the subject get downvoted to oblivion?</p>

<p>I mean, it&#39;s not like the information is not out there. It is all hidden in plain sight.  Think about it, why is this historic event protected by law from being revised? The ONLY historic event protected by law from even being discussed.  Is this not a big enough indicator they have a story to protect and that they do not want changed at all?</p>

<p>I have believed blindly for many years, today I believe nothing until I see facts myself. Although this will be mass-downvoted, I encourage you to dig into the subject and draw your own conclusions. In another comment on this post,  I left the 2 names of historians that dared question the so-called truth.  Google + YouTube can do the rest for you. I can assure you will see enough evidence from these 2 historians to question what you were taught on &quot;the holocaust&quot;.  Never mind they were discredited, this is totally to be expected as were the mass downvotes on my comments. Just get the facts and judge for yourself.</p>

<p>Of course, sticking to the official version makes life easier and brings more karma but I prefer to gather facts and make up my own mind. Too many things in the official story did not add up. </p>

<p>Karma is made to keep the sheeples happy, the only use I have for that crap is to indicate  what the shills and zionists support groups are monitoring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. My point is everyone knows &quot;6 million were gassed by Germans&quot;. The whole world knows and to this day it is taught in all Pro-Israel countries. Even if the 6 million figure is made up. Even if historians today acknowledge gas-chambers were not used to exterminate people. The myth lives on. I am not a &quot;Holocaust denier&quot; because I totally agree many many people died and suffered. I am a Holocaust revisionist, because I have discovered and verified many facts that point to massive propaganda.</p>

<p>Armenia (1.5 Million) , Cambodia (2+Millions), Russia (20+ Millions), North America (100 Millions +) , Rwanda (1.7 Millions) are all horrible massacres that are very rarely if ever brought up in our culture. Nowhere even CLOSE to the publicity the massacre in Germany garnered. Do you not feel the need to ponder on the reasons for this? Do you not feel the need to ponder on why a massacre in Palestine is acceptable, right now today in 2013 whereas what happened in 1940&#39;s needs to be perpetuated with hundreds of books and dozens of movies?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80GgRWuXcO8">Here is a movie, just for you</a>.  Just do me a favor, I am not a beggar by nature but I beg you to watch this with an open mind and see for yourself how we are constantly being lied and manipulated by special interest groups.</p>

Notice how <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1dy93w/should_we_allow_or_disallow_holocaust_denial/c9uzhlm">some</a> very <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1dy93w/should_we_allow_or_disallow_holocaust_denial/c9v0t54">rational comments</a> on the thread get mass down-voted without any logical explanation. These are not trollish or offensive in nature, so the only reasonable explanation I have is downvote brigades.</p></li>
<li><p>Last but not least, putting all paranoia aside,  <em>how can you be 100% certain</em> that articles like <a href="http://zioncrimefactory.com/2013/01/20/former-hasbara-operative-confesses-i-was-paid-by-enemy-jews-to-shill-for-israel-online/">this one</a> and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-fiorella/cyber-shills_b_2803801.html">this one</a> and <a href="http://consciouslifenews.com/paid-internet-shill-shadowy-groups-manipulate-internet-opinion-debate/1147073/">this one</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpVUYGcgtjw">this one</a> among hundreds, is <strong>all</strong> fake and made up? Do you believe powerful special interest groups would be above monitoring and censoring sensible information?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I live a very peaceful and calm life. Will be getting up tomorrow and spend the day in the garden. This does not mean I close my eyes and trust everything blindly around me. Yes, I am very weary of all major media outlets, because they are mostly government spokespersons and lord knows government is not to be trusted  but that is another story. Thanks for hearing me out yet again, I am not &quot;crazy&quot; nor paranoiac by nature.  When it comes to this sub and other informatin medias though, seeing how a simply <em>**asking</em>* if we can post on a specific historic event draws so many downvotes, I mean seriously???  </p>

<p>If you are still as confident and certain of your world-view as you were before this discussion, then good for you.  Personnaly, I prefer verifying most everything before I put faith in it. 45 years of being lied to by the people I thought were there to protect me has made me reconsider everything I was taught. From the Moon Landings to the JFK Assasinations to Vietnam false flags all the way up to 7/7 and 9/11, I think many people are just doomed to be forever mentally devoted to the illusion that government is their friend and acts in their best interest when the reality is that nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

<p>Peace to you friend, see you around. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no doubt as to 9/11 and 7/7. They were perpetrated by extremist groups, yet you do have points about not trusting our government, and hating special interest groups. Yet I also have no doubts that the people in charge are just as fallible as the rest of us. If the government really thought these people knew the truth. They wouldn&#39;t be allowed to share it. That&#39;s how I feel. I also have no desire it fear of them. I&#39;m more than capable of taking care of myself in all but the most drastic of situations. I&#39;m more the type to just see what happens and respond accordingly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well. I admire your brazenness. I actually had to think and ponder on this a good ten minutes before answering. I enjoy thinking, so thanks.</p>

<p>Yes, obviously I would probably have to censor somewhere along the line. Off-topic posts, including spam and other junk posts would be dropped. Things on topic would stay.</p>

<p>Considering we are in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> , and that we can talk about <strong><em>all sorts</em></strong> of conspiracy theories ranging from Illuminati to 9/11 to faked moon landings,  even <em>lizard people</em> for pete&#39;s sake ...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why would posts or <em>most any information</em> related to &quot;The&quot; holocaust be censored?</p></li>
<li><p>Why would I receive massive downvotes and personal threats by pm for stating my opinion, which is still quite moderate since I do not deny the events happened?</p></li>
<li><p>Why is it even <em>illegal</em> for non-jews to question or revise  <strong><em>this particular historic event only</em></strong> in Pro-Israel countries?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I am an old man and don&#39;t really have much to do with personal threats and warnings sent to my inbox. It only shows me how radical some of these people can be, and I am happy they are wasting precious time on someone that will be out laboring in the field most of the summer not even thinking about these matters, instead of annoying other people.  What worries me is the up-coming generations. My grand-children, your generation and those to come.</p>

<p>Having a taboo subject like this indicates people have something to hide and protect. But why?</p>

<p>I have a clue, and I will say it. The &quot;holocaust&quot; retribution business is a multi-billion dollars per year industry.
Heck, if you count all the foreign aid they receive from the western powers, you can add a few billions more.</p>

<p>Many people depend on these retributions for various reasons. These retribution packages and foreign aid funding could be what is protected.</p>

<p>Please, <em>I would be more than happy and grateful to hear your take on my above 3 questions</em>.</p>

<p>And on a parting note my loyal friend that stayed on until the thread&#39;s end, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk2-ZXAWkfg">here is a video</a> that explains clearly the things I am afraid of for you people in coming times. Sadly, it seems the path is already pretty much laid out and things are going as planned for the people that own us. </p>

<p>Cheers, take care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. And this is actually a good thing.</p>

<p>A little recap for you on the situation concerning my comment history.
Being a computer programmer / database administrator, I easily notice data patterns and trends in my computing habits.</p>

<p>Posting a comment on my 5 year old account predictably garners on average between -2 and +5 votes, with occasional peaks on both ends of the spectrum.  On a 24 hour timespan after the comment is posted, the votes trickle in. My posts are mostly respectful of others and non-trollish, so I get more upvotes that downvotes. Not that it matters, this is just to explain the trend of my data.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I posted about a dozen comments. The first few comments brought on a barrage of immediate downvotes, over 100 downvotes <em>within one hour of posting</em>. Very few comments on most of the downvotes.  This in itself made my spider senses tingle. I had read about others being censored but had never thought it could happen on my account.</p>

<p>I woke this morning to find the regular upvote pattern of regular users had trickled in through the night, bringing up +30 votes on yesterdays comments.</p>

<p>I can assure you, there is no emotional distress over this, I do not even feel it is a conspiracy since I have found much more convincing evidence on other accounts.  I am just stating plain facts that clearly indicate lightning fast mass downvotes on controversial topics.</p>

<p>Check it out for yourself, someday maybe you will experience this yourself and hopefully remember this conversation where I pointed out the obvious to you.</p>

<p>See you around, nice talking to you.</p>

<p>This is the only arguments people can put forth when one questions the lies.  Holocaust deniers, anti-semite, loony, hateful ... etc. Yet no one has countered the facts I presented. They can&#39;t because it&#39;s all a bumch of half-truths, half-myths.</p>

<p>Watch the links I posted and use your own judgement. If not blindly believing colonialist propaganda makes me an anti-semite, so be it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Come on.  I never said Irving was a Saint.  I admit he made enough slips to have him permanently discredited, and rest assure his life and family member&#39;s lives have pretty much been ruined.</p>

<p>Of course, a writer and public speaker is BOUND to have major slips. For example, Gandhi is renowned for his greatness in modern times, but was being labeled a terrorist in his active days.  Gandhi was an <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#hl=en&amp;amp;gs_rn=12&amp;amp;gs_ri=psy-ab&amp;amp;tok=6K59s_TAbKyWkfh3LScvMg&amp;amp;suggest=p&amp;amp;pq=mahatma%20gandhi%20not%20a%20saint&amp;amp;cp=17&amp;amp;gs_id=31&amp;amp;xhr=t&amp;amp;q=Mahatma%20Gandhi%20racist&amp;amp;es_nrs=true&amp;amp;pf=p&amp;amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;amp;oq=Mahatma+Gandhi+ra&amp;amp;gs_l=&amp;amp;pbx=1&amp;amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;amp;fp=fb48b97a5676c0dd&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;biw=1066&amp;amp;bih=516">outspoken racist</a> and many even say a bisexual pedophile.  Yet we all acknowledge he left a great legacy.</p>

<p>In the same vein, one can listen to any public figure, and I feel it is up to the individuals to judge what is worthy of hanging on to.  I listen to documentaries, read books, take notes and verify the facts I read.</p>

<p>David Irving, discredited as he is for his hatred of Zionists has very insightful lectures and is one of the most published historians on the specifics of WWII.  I am not saying the man is God, I am saying the man has made public lectures for many years and written over 30 books. Of course the mass of information he put forth is bound to contain wrongful statements. This does not mean it is 100% BS.</p>

<p>Pulling these phrases out of context, given to you heartily by the masses of special-interest groups that are bent on destroying him does not mean he had it all wrong.  Many historians have revised their findings because of his research, and yes I have read his wikipedia page a few times but remember he has enormous opposition on the matter by very powerful groups,  so of course do not expect anything positive to come out of Wkipedia for Irving.</p>

<p>Do yourself a favor, listen to a few of his lectures. Take notes, verify the facts.  I do not want to convince you of anything, just look at the facts and judge for yourself instead of relying on wikipedia to base your opinions.</p>

<p>The holocaust happened, and many suffered. This is a fact.  Up to this day, there was a LOT of propaganda and embelishment added to the story, this is also a fact. This is the main point I tried to make in this post&#39;s comments.</p>

<p>Thanks for hearing me out. Cheers.</p>

<p>If <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> decides to make it a rule to not speak about holocaust denial, then there&#39;s really nothing that can be done about it. It&#39;s not breaking any state or federal laws nor reddit global rules nor violating the U.S. Constitution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Notice how your posts mysteriously received 28 downvotes, yet not one counter-argument?</p>

<p>Special interest groups have &quot;downvote brigades&quot;. This will never be a popular topic, and posts on &quot;The&quot; holocaust never stay long. Read my comments in this post if you want a few links.</p>

<p>Be quick though, they will probably be taken down in the near future.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Unless ... you are like me and can pull a laugh out of it!</p>

<p>I gave you an upper but the shills are strong on this topic. 53 downvotes for your comment and counting, yet not one single counter-argument or reasonable explanation whatsoever.  Truly enlightening, don&#39;t you think?</p>

<p>I was warned twice that speaking my mind on this topic, in this sub would not be torlerated.  We can post hundreds and hundreds of articles on Boston Bombing though, those are well received.</p>

<p>Cheers friend, peace to you and loved ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh boy. &quot;Rockets&quot;.  How many Israeli casualties are we talking about?</p>

<p><a href="http://mondoweiss.net/2012/11/dissecting-idf-propaganda-the-numbers-behind-the-rocket-attacks.html">26 casualties since the past 10 years</a>. Most of those deaths occurred during Israeli invasions of Palestinian territories, condemend by a shit-load of (ignored) bull-shit UN resolutions let us not forget.</p>

<p><a href="http://middleeast.about.com/b/2009/07/24/israel-bans-al-naqba-from-textbooks.htm">Have you seen the Isreali map lately</a>?!?!?  What would you recommend the Palestinians do? Send flowers and hope for peace? Or maybe just wait until they are wiped out? Oh. Maybe they should turn to International court, or the UN to rid them of their oppressors? It seems International court was only useful for Nuremburg. The international laws meant to prevent genocide do not really apply for Palestinians, it seems. In fact, come to think of it ... International law is only applied when it serves western interests. </p>

<p>If your country was invaded and occupied in such a manner, would <strong>you</strong> be sending flowers and praying for peace, as your land and humand rights are stripped off slowly year after year? </p>

<p>Palestine, one of the poorest country in the world is a threat to Isreal, that boasts one of the most powerful armies in the world?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been trolled enough for today. Good-night sir.  </p>
