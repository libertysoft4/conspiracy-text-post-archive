    <div class="md"><p>I agree and brought up the same point in another thread.  The specific words and terms we use to describe our world and what happens in it influence how we perceive it, and it&#39;s important to be as accurate as possible. </p>

<p>Yes, those bombs killed people and hurt many others, but they most certainly did not cause <em>mass destruction</em>.  If the law says they were WMDs, then the law needs to be changed.</p>

<p>Just charge them with three counts of murder and over a hundred counts (can&#39;t recall the specific number) of attempted murder; that&#39;s accurate and should do the job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. If it meets the following requirements.</p>

<p>Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) are defined in US law (18 USC §2332a) as:</p>

<p><strong>(A) any destructive device as defined in section 921 of this title (i.e. explosive device);</strong></p>

<p>(B) any weapon that is designed or intended to cause death or serious bodily injury through the release, dissemination, or impact of toxic or poisonous chemicals, or their precursors;</p>

<p>(C) any weapon involving a biological agent, toxin, or vector (as those terms are defined in section 178 of this title)</p>

<p>(D) any weapon that is designed to release radiation or radioactivity at a level dangerous to human life.</p>

<p>Now check section 921 which defines <strong>destructive device</strong>.</p>

<p>(4) The term “destructive device” means—</p>

<p>(A) any explosive, incendiary, or poison gas—</p>

<p>(i) <strong>bomb</strong>,</p>

<p>(iii) rocket having a propellant charge of more than four ounces,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i know. i think in that case, the pressure cooker bombs should be considered weapons of mass destruction. the problem comes up due to the fact that when people hear wmd, they automatically think iraq and biological and chemical weapons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But if you define weapons of mass destruction so loosely, then the invasion of Iraq was justified, and they DID have weapons of mass destruction (grenades, etc). </p>

<p>Literally every country in the world has weapons of mass destruction. </p>

<p>Heck, anyone could go buy a pressure cooker and make a weapon of mass destruction. </p>

<p>See how ridiculous it gets? </p>

<p>Funny how things change according to the narrative needed. Remember when we &quot;needed&quot; to invade Iraq because Saddam had &quot;WMD&#39;s?&quot; I do.  As I said it&#39;s a specious classification. Any rational judge would see it as such. It&#39;s kind of an important distinction. </p>

<p>These bombs were filled with shrapnel and were designed to cause serious injuries to many people, but not to infrastructure. </p>

<p>For me, &quot;mass destruction&quot; Implies buildings being destroyed. </p>
