Even if you assume that just 1% of psychopaths are highly intelligent and sufficiently manipulative that is still leaves 30,000 people. Then if you assume that just 1% of them seek to get into powerful roles in government and corporations, that still leaves you with 300 people who are possibly playing massive roles in policy making. These people have the opportunity to control the lives of millions of people. How the US or any other government not fallen apart by now is a mystery to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s even worse than that.  Sociopathy helps one rise in government, so the concentration of sociopaths at higher levels is more than 1%.  I&#39;m guessing at minimum triple, and for Congress there&#39;s a good chance of at least 1 in every 20.   Since many in the Senate are wealthy people who gained their money with the help of sociopathic business activities (or their spouses, like Dianne Feinstein&#39;s husband), the proportion is even higher there. The Senate does NOT represent your interests.</p>

<p>Why does sociopathy help one rise? Because the lying, cheating, and lack of guilt help a sociopath win out over an honest person running for office.  Once in office, these help keep them there. Plus, sociopaths will cooperate with other sociopaths to keep themselves in power. So someone will vote for a bil another sociopath is pushing for his owners, to get beneficial quid pro quo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll add another fact. Psychopaths (or sociopaths) move very quickly up the corporate ladder because they are willing to be ruthless. They concentrate in higher positions in certain work areas. </p>

<p>Ironically, surgeons have a high incidence of sociopaths. Perhaps it&#39;s easier to cut someone open and hold their life in your hand when you lack empathy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Psychopaths and sociopaths are not the same thing. This is something that should be understood. Many sociopaths can lead normal lives, just without the feeling of empathy toward other people. People who are psychopaths, (anti-social personality disorder), are a completely different breed and have a hard time functioning in society if they can function at all. </p>

<p>The biggest difference in the two is a sociopath can understand pain and pleasure, using that to help him or her go forward in life. These people usually don&#39;t know what is wrong with them and often seem like regular everyday people. A psychopath doesn&#39;t quite get pain and pleasure; this leads to violence as they try and understand the world around them. </p>

<p>It outlines psychopathy and sociopathy as the root problem with society.  Another added note is how SSRI&#39;s decrease emotional reactions and tends to emulate psychopathy in normal people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>shakes had sadly</em> Having read through your comment history I just have to say, you need help. I believe that you are literally paranoid, a frightened little boy in the body of a man. Please seek counseling.</p>

<p>You are suffering from several delusions. Primary among them is the idea that you are more intelligent than other people, or more conscious / alert / discerning / shrewd - that only you and maybe a select few share your powers of observation. Otherwise why would only you few see through this masterfully constructed charade that is your enemies&#39; conspiracy to keep you down?</p>

<p>It is possible that you are of above-average intelligence. It is also possible that you are of below-average intelligence. But it is a <em>certainty</em> that there are <em>smarter</em>, more perceptive people than you and the vast majority of them - of all races, religions and backgrounds - do not share your point of view. You must ask yourself how that&#39;s possible. Especially if the group you believe is behind this great conspiracy is inferior to your own race, how is it possible that such a group could pull the wool over <em>so many superior peoples&#39; eyes?</em></p>

<p>Is this the reasoning that brings you to try to explain your point of view to others? Is the idea that this reasoning is flawed and you <em>know</em> it to be flawed the reason that you hide your identity while doing so? I think you know yourself to paranoid. I think you know you&#39;re wrong. I think you know that your ideas are an impossibility, and that frightens you more than anything else. It&#39;s just too convenient to blame someone for the world&#39;s problems, for your <em>own</em> problems. It&#39;s just too convenient to not blame yourself.</p>

<p>You must know that constructing reasons in your mind to deny anything that contradicts your established beliefs is not logical. You must know that contradicting science, history, philosophy in order to blame the world&#39;s problems on a small group of people makes no sense. There is a sickness inside you that is causing you to hurt yourself and may cause you to hurt others if it hasn&#39;t already. Genuinely, you need treatment, perhaps medication. You need to question your ideas regarding Jews. You need to actually learn to view things with your own eyes instead of believing nonsense that you read or are told - it is obvious you have never met an actual Jewish family by what you&#39;ve written.</p>

<p>Please, please get help. Get evaluated. Find out if your problem is only cognitive or if it&#39;s neurological and chemical as well. That can be genetic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if I told you that you drank too much of the conspiracy kool aid and that it&#39;s time to lay off?</p>

<p>Seriously though, for your own mental health, check into a clinic, talk to a psychiatrist, do something. Living this way is unhealthy and is undoubtedly shortening your lifespan, and for what? For some imaginary internet points and pats on the back from others with your condition? Don&#39;t you have friends or family that would like to see you go back the way you were before, happy and healthy? Not living in a paranoid delusional bubble?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see everyone in this topic moaning about &quot;our evil psycopathic overlords&quot; and realize that apparently people are not aware that psycopaths are <em>necessary</em> for occupying the top niches of any social/political/economic power structure.

So, our misunderstood friend, Natural Selection, always will keep psycopaths in power, and for a good reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you should tone it down a bit. By calling Ashkenazis psychopaths, you are crossing the line between religion and racism. We all know that the US government is controlled (mostly) by white Christians. So by using your logic on this topic, the same could be said of white Christians. We enable the psychopathic government of Israel to do their deeds, so ultimately who is more evil? I don&#39;t think evil or psychopathy is neatly confined within racial boundaries like that. Long story short, please tone it down. I like having you around. You are super knowledgeable about alot of subjects and you are generally respectful and obey the rules of the sub. If you start talking about Ashkenazis being psychopathic, you are crossing a line that was drawn in the sand a while ago. I&#39;m sorry but I can&#39;t bend the rules on this one. </p>

If I had to share a cabin in the woods for a weekend and my choice was you, Alan Dershowitz or Bibi Netanyahu, I&#39;d choose the latter 2 before I&#39;d ever choose you because you&#39;re a scary fascistic individual trying to force your beliefs onto everyone around you. </p>

<p>In fact having a nice long conversation with Dershowitz or Netanyahu is something I&#39;d pay to do because they are so full of knowledge and personal wealth and wisdom that can be spread. I can&#39;t say the same for you however, I&#39;d most probably pay to keep people like you away at all times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where are you getting information on a transition from &quot;Divine Female&quot; to &quot;male God of War&quot;? Most cultures of the time were polytheistic and it&#39;s quite possible to find what we might consider gendered roles in their opposite gender. Enki (or Ea), for instance, was a god of creation and fertility because it was his semen which created the Tigris-Euphrates. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_figurines">Venus figurines</a>? No one knows for sure what they are, and they certainly aren&#39;t definitively a &#39;lunar goddess&#39;. Chances are good they&#39;re simple fertility symbols. </p>

<p>edit: by the by, until you have physical, falsifiable evidence, it&#39;s not a <em>theory</em>, it&#39;s a <em>hypothesis</em>.</p>

<p>This sounds very interesting. Any books you would recommend for reading on the subject?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like you just have a chip on your shoulder for sucessful individuals. Dershowitz certainly hasn&#39;t done anything to receive any criticism let alone be accused of being a psychopath. Just admit you&#39;re a mad and jealous loser and do something about it man, change your life. It&#39;s never too late.</p>
