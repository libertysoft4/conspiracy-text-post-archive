    <div class="md"><p>Your are an idiot and dont know how insurgencies operate. You would fight amongst the general population employing shoot and scoot tactics and a lot of sniper kills against them. If they came to bomb the area they would just end up killing innocent people driving more people to the cause of revolution. Entire liberty minded military units would refuse to fight or would attack the other more agressive military units. The govt would have to bomb the entire country into ruble to win and then what did they win in the end?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, I believe a revolution will happen soon in the United States, not a violent revolution, but a revolution of the complete change of our political system and the overall power of the government. I pray and hope that soon a third party will rise and gain ground to overthrow the two party system and the status quo. I believe that in this age of such quick information at our fingerprints at all times people will slowly realize the way the country really works and work to change it. I see the younger generation ages 18-35, are really beginning to see how corrupt and wrong our government is at the moment. It doesn&#39;t matter who the President is, what party his, or what he really wanted or wants to do to change country, it&#39;s the people behind the curtain who call the shots and more and more people need to rise up and realize what is going on.</p>

<p>A violent revolution will most likely never take place unless the Armed Forces felt the need to overthrow the government ( like our Constitution states) but this has such a low probability that it most likely will never happen. It will be a revolution of information, and with the internet today, compared to the way people got information even just 20 or 30 years ago, it is more and more feasible that as the masses learn about the true intentions and corruption of the political system it will happen through non violent ways.</p>

<p>But with the power of the Government now, and the censorship that is getting more and  more radical, even the masses getting the real news gets smaller and smaller with every day passing. The National news networks get more and more coverage, and with it money, that reporting any TRUTH, gets weaker by the day. In this decade real reporting is no longer being done, news anchors and major news &quot;reporters&quot; and hand fed a script from government censors who make sure that on any national news network, they never question the intentions of what the Government is doing, and always spin the angle that they want.</p>

<p>We need to keep passing true reporting to everyone we know, and keep a strong group on websites such as this, so that the truth will always come out. The Government will always try to drown out what they don&#39;t want people to hear, we as Americans need the truth to surface and to elect officials that we believe will be new and change the way this country is run. We live in a great Nation, but the politicians need to realize it is the PEOPLE who run the country NOT the politicians who just want to gain more money and power. We need to return to a smaller Government, have them have less power and let the people decide on the issues that are going on, not 80 year old, Senator lobbyists that have no touch with what&#39;s going on, and no integrity or willpower to do what&#39;s right.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you even considered it might be the other way around? If you revolt and you fail, you just hammered the final nail in the coffin.&quot;right wing extremists try to overthrow government&quot; &quot;All anarchists are terrorists&quot;.

<p>Regardless on <em>what</em> method is required though, there are far too many people asleep to make a significant change, and far too low morale anyway. no matter what method is necessary, we don&#39;t have anywhere near the numbers to accomplish any of them. Getting that is <em>far</em> more important than figuring out <em>how</em> exactly to resolve our problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I simply do everything that I can to not pay federal income tax.  I think that it is important to denounce them and to not merely grumble but to openly state that they do not represent you and that they are not your government.  I have no loyalty to this federal government and I do not voluntarily submit to any policy of theirs.  Anything that they do to me is pure force and I treat it practically as one would a forceful occupation.  When the numbers grow I will see what the options are on the table.  They have permanently lost my heart and mind and there is no way that they can get it back because there is nothing that they have that they would be willing to negotiate with and they will remain in power until their arrogance causes them to crush enough people to the point that they can be easily overthrown.  There is so much illusion in the US that unfortunately I believe this will require quite a lot of crushing.  I&#39;ve accepted this inevitability and I will not be the suffering the agonies of a thrashing public because it will consume me to little effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. At the point which the government needs overthrown, voting will not have a considerable effect. </p>

<p>I also disagree that if there was some war against the people and the government, the govt would automatically win. Check out Vanderboegh&#39;s article <a href="http://westernrifleshooters.blogspot.com/2008/07/vanderboegh-handgun-against-army-ten.html">&quot;What Good Can a Handgun Do Against an Army&quot;</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we are preparing for a violent revolution unless the government actually manages to use it&#39;s fear-mongering to greatly limit or eliminate legal gun ownership. Without that step the populations power is only really limited by the fact that we think that corporatocracy is more powerful, but in reality we outnumber and outforce them.</p>

<p>Voting doesn&#39;t have a considerable effect now. That was the point I was trying to convey: The only thing more useless and rigged than voting is  war.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll check it out. However, the important thing to note is that if violent overthrow, or overthrow of any kind, is ever to happen half of the nation will think those attempting to overthrow are the bad guys. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think we are preparing for a violent revolution </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think we are either. I hope not at least. It has a probably a 5% success rate, and a 95% chance that it will make things worse. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>unless the government actually manages to use it&#39;s fear-mongering to greatly limit or eliminate legal gun ownership. Without that step </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure exactly what you&#39;re saying: are you saying that if guns are made illegal <em>then</em> people will start preparing for violent overthrow?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the populations power is only really limited by the fact that we think that corporatocracy is more powerful, but in reality we outnumber and outforce them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>depends on who you count as what. if you count &quot;we&quot; as the people who are fully awake to the reality of the situation (ie not people who think if we had a president from the other party that it&#39;d fix things), then I&#39;d be surprised if we number over a million. Half of us probably are not proficient in fire arms (as most are inner city dwellers I would think). It&#39;s all important to note that anyone who isn&#39;t awake is essentially on the other team. You have liberals <em>fighting</em> tooth and nail <em>for</em> the elite to take away our guns. Right now it is us +-1 million please the rest of america, <em>plus</em> the police, <em>plus</em> the DHS, <em>plus</em> the media, all while having to abide by the rules of corportacracy more or less. Our odds, whether the intention is violent or peaceful overthrow, are not in our favor to say the least. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one is considering violent overthrow.... It all truth, the reality on the ground here in America, is it&#39;s a pretty amazing place to live.  This last year I saw for the first time..... Times Square, Yellowstone, The Grand Canyon, Whales in Alaska, Lake Michigan, The Rocky Mountains.... I was even able to take a trip down to Hawaii and see the massive volcanic oasis....  I visited the Grand Ole Oprey... and the home of Elvis Presley...  I sampled some of the greatest wine in California..... and I got blazed out of my mind in Oregon.  I got to jog through Central Park for the first time.... and I visited the nation&#39;s capital... and saw giant enormous sculptures carved out of stone... sitting there like pillars of ancient history.  I perused our National Archives and got to see a copy of the original Magna Carta.... I met the governor of my state...  And Jack Nicholson.... </p>

<p>I grew a pretty large vegetable garden that has provided me and my family with all sorts of vegetables all year. I went fishing in Alaska and got a bountiful amount of Salmon and Halibut. Then I went fishing in the Gulf of Mexico where I filled my freezer full of Snapper.  They were delicious... and I didn&#39;t develop heavy metal poisoning.  This winter I went deer hunting and got enough venison for 6 months.  I basically was able to easily provide my whole family with food year round off 2 hunting trips, 2 fishing trips, and a giant garden. </p>

<p>And then I found 10 dollars in my pocket this morning.</p>

<p>America is a beautiful and amazing place....  And to be honest with you guys.... it only gets more awesome the more of it I get out there and experience.... Wow... if this land isn&#39;t the garden of Eden... then I don&#39;t know what is.

<p>Please note, even without this poll, there are more than a few within this community, and i&#39;m sure hundreds of thousands around this contrary, who believe that a new American Revolution is the only answer. And I&#39;m sure there are millions who at least have taken it into consideration, I know I have. </p>

<p>I am glad you&#39;re having such a wonderful time, but conspiracy theory or not, our country has been run by corporations for centuries and we the people are getting fucked by it. This is a pretty much accepted by the majority of Americans and is not something worth arguing. </p>

<p>100 million people think armed rebellion might soon be necessary?   Weird, because I haven&#39;t met a single person like the last 10+ years in this country. You&#39;d think I would have ran into one of these 100million revolutionaries at some point. It&#39;s comical that people would actually be stupid enough to believe that assertion. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>And what did you come up with.... what are you revolting against?  You&#39;re not hungry. Your family isn&#39;t being rounded up and forced to dig ditches till they die. If you want to be successful, all you really gotta do is open your eyes and see the massive amount of opportunity all around you. Really all you got to do is get on this computer.... teach yourself how to program... and use a free lance site to start building websites.... Or you could do stupid human tricks at 5 bucks a pop on FiveRR...  Maybe you got a great idea for a movie.... you can develop that and get funding on Kickstarter....  Maybe you make these beautiful paintings of seals.... you can now actually make a living off selling that on the internet... Etsy... or Ebay... or a custom website.... and for the first time in human history.... any old man on the street.... can offer a product up for sale.... to over 3 billion people simultaneously....  That used to be a power only a few corporations had.... Now every human being has it....  I know people that now make 6 figures... making braided belts in their spare time and selling them online.  </p>

Job had no growth potential.... so what he did was save some money... He got on shopify.com and built him a little e-commerce store.... and through it he sells magnesium supplements. He has a company that handles fulfillment and putting the product together.  All he does is sits on his computer, and waits for old ladies to engage him through the chat window when they want to buy some magnesium. He went from nothing... to over 100k in revenue in about 5 months.  This was his first business endeavor.  He quit his insurance job... and now he&#39;s currently travelling the US staying in various cities with AirBnB. He&#39;s been in Maimi, San Francisco.... he&#39;s on his way to Hawaii next. </p>

<p>without getting poisoned by multinational corporations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yea that&#39;s why I threw in that whole garden and hunting part...  I got my own food... which didn&#39;t put me at the will of a giant corporations mistakes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>being denied healthcare and an affordable education.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You know... I rarely need healthcare. I take care of myself. So I reject the notion that I &quot;need healthcare&quot;. What I actually &quot;need&quot; is to take care of myself so I don&#39;t get to that &quot;healthcare&quot; mess. Interesting... my entire education was paid for by various government scholarships, charitable organizations, and a bit of hard work on my part.  And this was a 100k education. Not a community college. There&#39;s plenty of financial aid and opportunity out there... you just gotta go out, find it, and work to get it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Try raising a kid on minimum wage </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well you see, I took steps at a very young age to ensure that I didn&#39;t ever have to do that. When I was a kid I payed attention in school. I stayed out of trouble. I developed useful skills like software programming. I read a lot. I listened a lot more. I took a very active and agressive plan to ensure that what I did in the first 24 years of my life... would make those after it largely easy.</p>

<p>I was raised by my mother, and her boyfriend(s). She worked various low paying jobs off and on... but she could never keep them because her boyfriend&#39;s would get her on crack or meth benders (i dunno what it was, but they stayed up all night) and she stopped going.  Sometimes there was no food to eat... not because we didn&#39;t have the ability to get it... but because mom was sleeping for 3 days.  </p>

<p>So yea, I was a kid raised on less than a minimum wage job... and you know what... I saw that my future was largely the product of my ambition and choices.... and that if I put the effort in... America wouldn&#39;t stand in my way to change my situation. In fact, it helped me quite a bit. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of opportunity and beauty in this country... just open your eyes and see it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry?  I treasure my childhood....  it taught me a lot about being foolish. And about being responsible for your own life. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to be negative... I&#39;m trying to illustrate theres this world out there with tons of reasons to be positive about.... and that it&#39;s a negative mindset that&#39;s preventing one from seeing it and taking advantage of it.  Instead of being responsible for their own life and working actively to change it... they just blaming some amorphous concept and claiming they&#39;re a victim... which is very cowardly and ignorant. To me, it sounds like a baby crying.... helpless. weak. ignorant.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have anything &quot;I would like to see changed&quot;... Society evolves according to a much more complex system than I could possibly comprehend...  I can&#39;t say I want to see anything in particular change... I can say, however, no doubt that it will change and how it changes is largely out of my control.  I&#39;m just along for the ride at this point. </p>

<p>But if I had to see one thing changed... it would be the overwhelming effort to begin colonizing and terraforming the Moon and Mars.  The way I see it... either we&#39;re working to grow to multiple planets such that there is redundancy in our survival....  or we&#39;re just getting real comfortable for the cataclysm.  Which will be interesting... as our species dies and hungers.... and splits into victims whining about whatever... and the cannibal hunters that eat them. </p>

<p>Change is largely out of your control huh? What was all that about being responsible for your own life? Are you helpless to change your life or can you do anything you put your mind to? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You asked what change do I want to see in society.... Which is the entire group of human beings... most of which I have no control over.  So that kind of change I am helpless over.  In my own life, I have a good amount of control.... but  there are much more powerful things out there which I am helpless to control. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clarify. Want to go to Mars and the Moon? GO.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Begin developing a transport system that can regularly and reliably travel between the moon and Earth.</p></li>
<li><p>After that, begin the colony experiments.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop a cheap to launch, small vehicle that can be guided to Mars carrying biological &quot;seeds&quot;. A single launch could contain thousands of these tiny vehicles, which will pepper the planet surface on arrival.</p></li>
<li><p>Begin researching terraforming heavily. Any possible candidates that can photosynthesize in freezing cold with little water.... send them to Mars. The idea is to just send as much green life that survives cold and little air as we can in the hopes that one survives and multiplies.... and maybe in 300-500 years humanity might have a very tiny oasis on Mars that can be fostered.  Maybe in a couple thousand years, mars could have a bit more oxygen in its atmosphere from these plants and heat up just a little to put more liquid water closer to the surface. </p></li>
<li><p>Quit talking about sending a manned mission to Mars. Its fucking stupid. What practical purpose does that have? None at this point. We cant even get to the moon and back on a regular basis. Why are we talking about sending people on a trip 600 times longer and 10,000 times riskier... than one we already can&#39;t do reliably or regularly. </p></li>

<p>I never said it was... in fact its not... but ultimately most of us chose to be the victim or &quot;take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing.. end them.&quot; </p>

<p>You wanted to know what change I would like to see... and I said increasing funding to NASA/space and push for research in the above areas. That is an answer to your question. </p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re suggesting the terraforming of Mars is &quot;fucking it up&quot; . I was trying to say terraforming mars is necessary for our continued survival.... Additionally, I was hinting at there&#39;s nothing we can do to that planet that ultimately fucks it up as much as when it becomes engulfed by our sun.... That was a poorly worded sentence you&#39;re right though. </p>
