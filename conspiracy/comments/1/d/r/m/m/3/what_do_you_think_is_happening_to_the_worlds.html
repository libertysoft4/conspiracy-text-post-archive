<p>The killing of the egoistic attachment many have to those thoughts, dogmas, and religious inklings that they were indoctrinated with from birth.</p>

<p>That is <em>very</em> hard to give up and get rid of.</p>

<p>Interesting that you would advocate the killing off of emotional cognition in favor of rational, instead of finding balance and synthesis between them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  I don&#39;t advocate for the killing of emotional cognition in general.  You misread, and I myself am also at fault for not wording what I meant better.  The emotional killing that I meant involved only that emotional state which is dogmatically attached to those things that are ultimately NOT in the interest and benefit of holistic improvement and development spiritually and emotionally speaking.</p>

<p>As such, I <em>do</em> indeed very much advocate a balance and a synthesis between both the spiritual and the rational.  As a matter of fact, the spiritual and the rational, once one gets to an astute enough level of understanding, converge and are both two sides of the same equation and dynamic.  They are simply two ways of looking at The One.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Left brain imbalance is just as much a sickness as right brain imbalance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is correct, and it is very good that you pointed it out.  Thank you.  Left brain imbalance is just as much a sickness as right brain imbalance.  One should not overly sway toward one side or the other at the dogmatic exclusion of either.</p>

<p>They both have their place and importance when assessed and dealt with in a balanced manner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of the world&#39;s mainstream religions are in their death throes.  Whether these religions want to admit to themselves or not, their congregations are changing and adapting to a much more connected world.  Traditionally, religious institutions have played a major role in the control of the flow of information.</p>

<p>The internet has changed all of that.</p>

<p>Yes, there are still &quot;true believers&quot; and I am not advocating that these religions should be destroyed, or their adherents eradicated.  However, to survive these death throes, and to arise transformed from their deaths like the mystical phoenix, they must embrace change on a global scale; specifically, they must become more tolerant of each other.</p>

<p>I think that mankind is a spiritual animal; meaning, our species is prone to ask questions about the nature of the universe that don&#39;t bother gerbils and (as far as we know) dolphins.  In our youth, we have sought answers based upon childish notions of a Big Mommy in the earth or a Big Daddy in the sky (and all of their brothers and sisters).</p>

<p>The &quot;new age&quot; when you discard the trappings and the marketing cons represents a fundamental shift if the paradigm(s) of how mankind approaches these spiritual questions.  If we are, in fact (as so many religions have been at great pains to pontificate), made in the image of &quot;God&quot; (too bad their gods have, so far, been mere projections of tribal mores cast into anthropomorphic form!), it is time we start realizing that mankind is composed of living gods and goddesses.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right.  Let that sink in.  Mankind is made up of living gods and goddesses.</p>

<p>This Secret is one of the highest arcanums of mystical inner circles for the past few thousand years.  Whereas the mass populations profaned the symbols of their religions by belief in literal sky gods and earth goddesses, the High Priests, High Priestesses, and Hierophants - and the Adepts and Masters that created the systems they expound - know that all real spiritual power comes from within the adherent.</p>

<p>To quote Kung Fu Panda - &quot;There is no secret ingredient.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But Lord NShYH, what proof do you have of this wild claim?&quot;</p>

<p>Well, look at the history of human evolution and culture.  It is rich, and varied.  It is also a history filled with savage brutality.  During the matriarchal times, characterized by hunter and gatherer cultures, mankind regarded The Ultimate Truth as both a nurturing and fierce force of nature in the form of a Mother Goddess.  From the Great Mother did all life originate, and to her did all life return.  She was regarded as both the womb and the tomb.  Look at the early myth cycles of Isis and other Goddesses.</p>

<p>During the ages of patriarchy (and the modern upheavals in societies across the globe signal patriarchy&#39;s death throes), we have mankind looking at The Ultimate Truth in the form of a Sky Father God who sacrifices himself, and all of his aspirations, to the service of his tribe.  Look at the myth cycles of Asar/Osiris, and pay attention to how Isis mourns the death of Asar/Osiris.  Look at the formula for the resurrection of Osiris, and make note that Tahuti - god of wisdom! - had to fashion a new phallus for this God.  (The phallus has bee used since antiquity to symbolize the generative power and the will of man.)</p>

<p>In the patriarchy, we have the Slain and Resurrected God:  In Christianity, we have the lie created by the Council of Nicea known as &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; which completely misrepresents the Christian Gnosis (two important points on the &quot;primitive&quot; Christian doctrine: 1.  Everything that lives is Holy, and is therefore a living Temple of the Holy Ghost.  2.  The Kingdom of Heaven is within.  Please understand the meanings of YHShVH Christos - two honorific titles - where YHShVH is YHVH with the descent of the Holy Fire/Spirit of God into the YHVH of demiurge and Christos which means the &quot;annointed one&quot; who was crowned king after rigorous spiritual training!), dying on the cross for some imaginary sins only to be resurrected.  The moral lesson taught, either directly or indirectly, is that the Father must sacrifice all for his beloved on the altar of his aspirations in service to the kingdom of god - how convenient for Rome!  </p>

<p>For a modern version of this dramatic ritual, look at Freemasonry and Hiram Abiff.</p>

<p>Now, we may conveniently classify this &quot;new age&quot; as combining and exceeding traits of the Matriarchy and the Patriarchy; effectively symbolized by the character traits of Horus the Younger.  We, as a species, act like spoiled children, we love to indulge in all manner of entertainment, we focus on ourselves as our primary interest, and we are quicker than ever to rush into war.  We are prone to tantrums and fits on a larger scale than ever before, and now more than ever, we seem to crave instant gratification of every whim.  We make disastrous and childish decisions regarding our finances - look at the various bubbles inflated by speculation; that is, gambling!</p>

<p>Yet, among all of these wild impulses, we are expected to master ourselves and adapt to this strange new world hinted at by the science fiction of the past couple hundred years.  We can, and will (as a species), rise to the task.  But, we are likely to burn our hands on the stove a few times, and we&#39;ll get a scraped knee or two.  Hell, Earth Mommy and Sky Daddy might need to wipe our noses and pat us on the ass once in a while.</p>

<p>But we&#39;ll continue to grow and adapt.</p>

<p>If you are fortunate enough to live under the aegis of modern western civilization (or in a culture that has been dominated by western influence and capitalism), you have, at your disposal, the means for gratifying most of your desires (that is, of course, if you weren&#39;t foolish enough to buy more house than you could afford during the real estate bubble of the last decade!).  But, those at the top possess even more means, and like spoiled children, they act as if their indulgences and desires are the only important considerations for the entire planet!</p>

<p>Of course, this summary is a bit lacking, and a bit condensed; however, this is just a post on <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a>, not a dissertation for a PhD!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TLDR first. Religion will become non-existant. 
Here&#39;s my Christian theory: In the book of Revelation it states that in the end the beast will practice the ancient Babylonian religion. In Genesis the Babylonians contained all the worlds population and they spoke one language. They worked together and were able to build a giant tower. God basically said if they can do this, anything they attempt they will succeed, so he confused the language. So perhaps the Babylonian religion is one of cooperation and unity. Now imagine if the world were unified there would be less dependence on religion. So I think eventually we will grow to be less religious and eventually abandon it. </p>

<p>On another note I think the &quot;mark of the beast&quot; will be an allegiance to a government. It will be 666 which is man&#39;s number (a belief in the power of man). It will be written on their hands and foreheads. This is metaphorical, your hands symbolize physical allegiance while forehead symbolizes a mental/spiritual allegiance. No one will be able to trade/buy/sell without the mark. The mark will be an allegiance rather than a physical mark or &quot;chip&quot; since things like that can be manipulated/defrauded. It will be an allegiance to the one world government maintained by DNA analysis.   Just my thoughts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, but I think it will be like the movie GATTICA. You pledge allegiance, give a blood test, and then your part of their system. A bar-code can be copied or frauded some how. DNA can&#39;t. It&#39;s getting very cheap and efficient to do a DNA analysis. Soon a cop on the street will be able to do a quick test with a hand held machine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think you misused TLDR</p>

<p>Edit: I read it anyway.  You have good thoughts.  I think the Tower is a metaphor for interplanetary colonization, and perhaps has something to do with what&#39;s going on around us.. right now.</p>

<p>Pretty sure DNA is irrelevant to the equation, but the &#39;allegiance&#39; idea is right on.  Maybe there is some &quot;non physical&quot; way of causing or mandating allegiance.  </p>

<p>So, have you guys heard that the same lawyer who represented former MK-ULTRA victim Ted K. is now representing Tsarnaev?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...the Vedas say that Kali Yuga, the current Age of Strife and Quarrel, presided by the demon Kali Purusha [not to be confused with Goddess Kali], will hold for another cca 400, 000 years. In this time things will go worse and worse. </p>

<p>to give you just one quote from the book where all this is described:</p>

<p>&quot;When there is a predominance of cheating, lying, sloth, sleepiness, violence, depression , lamentation, bewilderment, fear and poverty, that age is Kali , the age of the mode of ignorance. Because of the bad qualities of the age of Kali, human beings will become shortsighted, unfortunate, gluttonous, lustful and poverty-stricken. The women, becoming unchaste, will freely wander from one man to the next. (<a href="http://vedabase.net/sb/12/en">Srimad Bhagavatam 12.3.31</a>)</p>

<p>or </p>

<p>&quot;In the age of Kali , people’s minds will always be agitated. They will become emaciated by famine and taxation, my dear King, and will always be disturbed by fear of drought. They will lack adequate clothing, food and drink, will be unable to properly rest, have sex or bathe themselves, and will have no ornaments to decorate their bodies. In fact, the people of Kali – yuga  will gradually come to appear like ghostly, haunted creatures. (SB 12.3.39-40)&quot;</p>

<p>...an entire Canto is dedicated to describing the Kali Yuga</p>

<p>Remember that Old communities of money and power existed in Religious backgrounds - and that these old communities STILL EXIST. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to regard this as kookery - it&#39;s simply true; that a great many people are personally influenced by their spiritual outlooks and communities that form their perspective, and that many people with lots of power have grown up in these circles/communities.</p>

<p>These are their fathers, their mothers, their grandparents, uncles, family friends etc who have helped them become what they are and are still alive (in some form) today. Along with old stories of prestige/lineage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh... Judaism you have that one right. Christians are waiting for Jesus to come back, not waiting for the Anti-Christ. Christians believe Jesus will come first, then the Anti-Christ will appear, that&#39;s what I heard anyway.</p>

<p>I never heard anything about the Muslims... just so much fucking jihad by extremists, and that it&#39;s GROWING across the nation, which worries me. Out of all the religions, in this day in age, they are violent and if you have seen passages in the Qu&#39;ran (read it for science/amusement), they are violent, I don&#39;t give a fuck with the whole &quot;ISLAM IS A RELIGION OF PEACE&quot;, give me a fucking break.</p>

<p>Mormons... LOL when I typed that I accidentally typed morons... but anyway, I never heard that one either. Regardless, just shrug it off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well Europe is getting flooded by Islamic extremists; countless rapes of teenage women each day (Especially Netherlands), etc. So if anything, that 1000 years of peace is proven fake. If the Messiah really is coming then hopefully that&#39;ll fix that. Not sure where the Anti-Christ fits in, maybe that&#39;s why Europe and the West are in that situation in the first place; could be that Jesus <strong>is</strong> the Messiah that will kill the anti-Christ, he was Jewish anyways...</p>

<p>Mormon Doctrine is that the 1000 years of peace comes after Christ has restored his kingdom on earth, and not before. The OP has it wrong on what LDS believe.</p>
