    <div class="md"><p>Mr. donbueno, I am new to your subreddit.  I joined just before the Boston bombing attacks so I got to enjoy this sub for a couple of days before seeing its population suddenly jump as the &quot;false flag&quot; accusations drew more and more interested readers/posters who were not as open minded as the existing population.</p>

<p>My question is simple: do you feel the influx of new redditors is part of a larger plot to discredit the ideas in this subreddit, instigated by any number of possible parties, or do you think it is a natural reaction to the situation in Boston and that, as attention is inevitably drawn elsewhere, the population will ebb to pre-Boston numbers?</p>

<p>I am merely curious, and you said AMA.  I enjoy this sub, I enjoy the open flow of ideas and theories, and I appreciate this opportunity to ask a question, whether you answer or not.  Ewige blumenkraft.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Welllll, not to say I necessarily <em>advocate</em> the idea, but some have pointed out that the government has budgeted money towards effecting social media...  It would be relatively cost effective to have a couple agents managing 20 or so accounts each and using them to direct/shape discussions, especially on a site like reddit with up/down votes.  Not saying that&#39;s what happened/happens/will happen, I&#39;m just curious what donbueno&#39;s opinion is, because it seemed like many people involved in instating the 30 day rule believed this was the case.

<p>This is the conclusion of you, alone, without consultation with anyone except one mod.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At that point I did what need to be done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without evaluating the need to do so or the merit in doing so, <em>that was not your decision to make</em>. If the Mods are not working as a deliberative body, the solution is not for a strong man to disband the body.</p>

<p>Many coups, military juntas, and dictatorships in the 20th century follow a certain pattern. Usually, it involves a small coterie of people, led by a strongman or a puppet strongman, seizing power and deposing those whose power the plotters deem unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care about <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> or the mods. It&#39;s the fucking internet. But, you honestly have you look at yourself if you think an overt power grab is the proper solution to 9000sins&#39; hasty rulemaking. Yes, an <em>overt</em> and unsubtle power grab. A palace coup. That was your solution based on what was very little provocation. </p>

<p>His hasty &quot;emergency&quot; rule did not necessitate your hastier coup. Your response was, frankly, the thing that makes government conspiracies so dangerous. They act with impunity and expect they&#39;ll never get caught.</p>

<p>Now, there&#39;s ample proof that you have the same gene. That&#39;s fucking scary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don,</p>

<p>I get why you did what you did.</p>

<p>That being said I really think that you jumped the gun and made an ass of yourself.  The 30 day rule sure does smack the spirit of free speech right across her face but so does an organized mob of trolls, jidfs, and drama queens.</p>

<p>When we have multiple groups of people in competition over &quot;who gets to speak&quot; and the consensus of the mods is that &quot;everyone gets to speak&quot; and those groups start waring upon everyone and ignoring the rules of the subreddit.  The mods took a long hard look at the situation and the ONE thing that was a common denominator among all the mini-tyrants was that they used brand new accounts.  </p>

<p>We decided to try something new and it appears to work.  </p>

<p>Free speech isn&#39;t easy, its a lot of hard work.  Just like IRL Klan rallies and panther walks the police have to line the streets or people might get killed.  Now in reddit obviously you can&#39;t die from someone&#39;s post, but your ability to participate can be killed effectively.  Massive down vote brigades cause your comments to be buried unfairly and then the same people up vote their own garbage to the top, thousands of comments.  Nobody can dig thru that mess.  </p>

<p>They stalk you onto other reddits and ruin your experience there as well.</p>

<p>We just want a place that WE are allowed to talk.</p>

<p>Your input on the situation would have been welcomed and a debate could have been had about it then.  Sorry that didn&#39;t happen but honestly, we forgot that you even existed.</p>

<p>Edit: well that makes it easier to read.  Still doesn&#39;t look like it was much of an invitation to debate or discuss, looks like the rule was just implemented without anybody asking for the rule.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reading through that post, it seems only the OP is calling for a 30 day rule.  And that&#39;s only if you use some tortured logic to make the link that &quot;most accounts are 30 days old&quot; = &quot;we need to ban accounts less than 30 days from posting.&quot;  There are a fair amount of upvoted comments that say the idea is dumb.  </p>

<p>Either way, that doesn&#39;t address my point that it looks like enfrozt went off and had automoderator add the rule without discussing it with everyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, I misread the mess from enfrozt as being form him, rather than him quoting you.  </p>

<p>Still, that doesn&#39;t address the other point - you went off and added the rule to automoderator without a real clamoring for the rule itself.  That post you cited as an example of everyone and their mother wanting the rule doesn&#39;t ask for that rule to be implemented at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that answer still seems disingenuous.  You&#39;re effectively cutting out new users that come here and want to contribute, but this is an old argument that others have already hashed out more eloquently than me.  If you&#39;re going to put in a new rule, and you&#39;re trying to be transparent about it, why not ask the people that are here and participating?  It just smacks of not trusting your userbase.  Even within the moderators, shouldn&#39;t you allow at least some discussion before putting a rule in place?  Maybe a &quot;hey, I&#39;m thinking of adding a 30 day rule to automoderator, what do all you you all think?&quot;  rather than &quot;Hey, I did this, hope you like it.&quot;</p>

<p>Edit: I was also trying to respond to the now deleted commented calling you a pussy, but it was deleted too quickly.  It read: Don&#39;t be a dick, that&#39;s not going to incentivize him any more to have a vote.</p>
