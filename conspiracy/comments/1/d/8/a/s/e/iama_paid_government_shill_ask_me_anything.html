    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so there are a lot of similar companies that do similar work, that is the first thing that you need to understand. And the contracts that we have are very protected, so if you&#39;re not working on a project, or with a certain partner you are not privy to very much info, sometimes not any. </p>

<p>There is no department that works on reddit, or facebook, etc; we work on the message for the partner. So we can follow it around to different sites, or wherever the conversation is happening. </p>

<p>I do know a few people do regularly work on reddit, including <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> but you don&#39;t need a lot of people to make an impact, sometimes it&#39;s a simple 1 liner comment that does it. </p>

<p>FYI, most of the people that you accuse of being &quot;government shills&quot; are not. I can recognize them almost immediately by the style of writing and the message.</p>

<p>And yes there are some that are moderators on reddit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll appreciate this one, during both elections we were contracted to push the Barack Obama birth certificate controversy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You were pushing the same stuff donald trump did ?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/donald-trump-birth-certificate">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/donald-trump-birth-certificate</a></p>

<p>Interesting coincidence. I guess he was not paying the bills. That would mean somebody else did. </p>

<p>And than, question arises.. cui bono (who profits) ?</p>

<p>Obama did win the elections.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you want to think about this another way, it&#39;s PR work, much the same way as they are doing subliminal marketing during TV shows by having product labels facing the camera or getting a close up of the manufacturer of a car as it drives away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree. It is PR or propaganda. Whatever you want to call it. Take a look at this <a href="http://www.4shared.com/office/ndfa5FFU/propaganda-_bernays.html">http://www.4shared.com/office/ndfa5FFU/propaganda-_bernays.html</a></p>

<p>What are your experiences with a job ? Did you learn something ? </p>

<p>In what direction do you think they are paying you to push public opinion ?</p>

<p>And, of course, what do you think about his birth certificate ? I guess you did spend some time talking about it..</p>

<p>I doubt it was in any way affiliated with Donald Trump, we didn&#39;t really push it either way, we just brought up the question and encouraged the debate.</p>

<p>I would guess that same people who were paying mr. trump were paying you. You know, like upper levels of pyramid ?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean about my experience with a job.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you like it ?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We receive a ton of research materiel with every job that we get so we always learn something, whether it&#39;s valid or not is another conversation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, tell me what do you think (from your experience) what stuff was valid and what was not.. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As far as the direction we are paid to push public opinions, whomever contracts with use we try to steer the conversation however they want us to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But there has to be a pattern. Did you notice it ?</p>

<p>And, what are the prices. Let&#39;s say I would like to push an agenda..how much would it cost ?</p>

<p>Can anybody rent your services ?</p>

I don&#39;t really buy most of what people discuss on this sub but I find it curious how so many go out of their way to mock <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Probably one out of every five threads (sometimes more, sometimes less) is someone&#39;s effort to prove CTs wrong, and more often than not the OP assumes every CT believes every conspiracy.</p>

<p>Obviously you&#39;re not being a dick or anything, but I don&#39;t really know what you were hoping would happen with this thread. You mocked the lingo and set yourself up as an opponent right off the bat, not exactly a great way to start a rational discussion</p>
