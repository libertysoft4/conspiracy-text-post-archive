        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why do I doubt the government to such a harsh degree?  Why do I thrive on calling these officials out?  Well, it finally hit me and I think I can put it into one concrete phrase.  Before I do, I&#39;d like to say that government is supposed to be transparent.  For example, when you ask a government official or a federal reserve chairman a question, we as a public deserve a prompt, no bullshit, honest answer.  No pedantic statements or beautifully worded anti-terrorism rhetoric, and no having someone hauled off by police for asking a question; just a straight-forward, concrete answer.   Now, with this in mind, ask yourself &quot;How often does that <em>actually</em> happen?&quot;  Think about the last time our president was able to present concrete evidence or actually answered a question thoroughly.  Also, ask yourself &quot;How often have American politicians (both democrat and republican) been caught in their own lies?&quot;  &quot;How many times have our representatives slipped up on national television?&quot;</p>

<p>The phrase goes as follows:
<em>I don&#39;t doubt the government necessarily because of anything they say. I doubt the government because of what they don&#39;t say.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Secret societies, organized crime, and state run law enforcement and intelligence organizations all have their own reasons for not talking about what&#39;s going on around them. Secrecy leads to erroneous conclusions based on incomplete, and often wrong, informations. It breeds a spirit of paranoia, fear, uncertainty, and doubt. That is not an healthy atmosphere to live in.         </p>

<p>They have to tell the truth so we can talk to each others in the spirit of building a rapport of trust among people. Then, we&#39;ll all see that the big scary boogyman really is just a silly little shit cowering in the shadows...        </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t just politics is it?  It&#39;s all pervasive!  How many documentaries have you watched where you actually know a lot about the subject matter?  Every single time you end up spitting your dinner over the TV because the documentary starts out telling the truth, and then it starts slipping in absolute blatant lies.  I work in gvt so I&#39;m used to it, but even local news reporting can&#39;t even tell the straight truth about something as simple as a storm, it will either greatly exaggerate an event, or interview people who weren&#39;t even involved who come out with the most shocking bullshit.

<p>What I heard was... some are more equal than others. Transparency isn&#39;t important. It&#39;s not mob rule because the mob is interested. It&#39;s not mob rule until the government goes too far. You have no idea what mob rule is. Mob rule is what&#39;s happening on this subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To a point, yes, but that doesn&#39;t mean the police haven&#39;t done things that beg for oversight. I care less about the conspiracies and more about the constitutional rights violated, and ineffectively so, given the ultimate goal, and that it took a tip from a resident to lead the dogs to the right hunt. I&#39;m concerned about the sheer number of bullets and police it takes to bring down a single kid, especially after he&#39;s holed up in a boat when they find him. Due process. Everyone has a right to that. The 4th amendment. Everyone has a right to that. Innocent until proven guilty. Everyone has a right to that, but the FBI doesn&#39;t feel it&#39;s necessary to protect any of those rights for the sake of capturing a terrorist who killed less people than were probably killed in violent street crime during the search.</p>

<p>Does any terrorist deserve justice? You bet. He also succeeds at his goal through his capture more than his actual crime. More people were terrorized in the manhunt than during the bombing.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m getting downvoted by association, so I can&#39;t even engage in long-winded discussions outside of one post, because it&#39;s ineffective. The trolls have overrun the sub and downvoted everyone, slagged them, and threw context to the wind. Everyone is guilty by association here. I think that&#39;s a sign that the terrorists won, because you have a bunch of Americans effectively blocking free speech, with no regard for it&#39;s content.</p>

<p>Throwing context out of the wind is saying that the cops needed that civilian to catch the kid, when they did 99% of the work.</p>

<p>If you think that leting the cops look around your house is more terrible than living in fear of another bombing, than you do not understand what terror is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why: because they are trying to make themselves appear in the best light they can. This is normal human behavior, not exclusive to the government. Ask <em>anyone</em> a pointed question about their job, implying that they&#39;re not doing their job very well or implying that you don&#39;t approve, and they will sound just the same way, defensive and trying to make themselves look good. Have you ever been in a business meeting where an idea is being pitched? You&#39;ll see the same kind of behavior. Even just asking someone about themselves, you can see how they&#39;re trying to depict themselves in the best light. </p>

<p>Does that mean <em>everybody</em> who does not tell the absolute, undressed truth is covering up some huge secret? Of course not. They&#39;re just trying to look their best. Politicians don&#39;t give straightforward answers? Of course, because they care even more about their image than most others. Is that because they are covering something up? It&#39;s probably because they want to get <em>re-elected</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I am familiar with the Rahm quote. But instead of them having come up withe crisis, why can&#39;t they just take advantage of every crisis. </p>

<p>Look at the boston bombings, everyone is using it to push their agenda, people for immigration reform say this boston case helps, people against immigration say the boston incident helps their case.</p>

<p>Sure the government has acted shady and continues to do so.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at some false flags, Gulf of Tonkin? The US fired first, and in the second encounter before everything was known it was used as an excuse to go to war. What&#39;s more plausible that the whole thing was a set up? Or Nervous sailors got into a firefight and the government twisted and used that story as a pretext for war.</p>

<p>You&#39;re going to have to do better than a Rahm Emmanuel quote paraphrasing an old chinese proverb.</p>

<p>Did 9/11 allow bush to do things and enact legislation that he wouldn&#39;t have been able to do before? Damn right, but that in itself is not proof that he caused it, just that he used the aftermath to his advantage. (which i believe all people and governments do. look at this sub taking whatever events and using them to promote their own narative.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is he wrong though? </p>

<p>I disagree with government tactics. I know they do shady shit. I don&#39;t think they planned 9/11 or the Boston bombing. I still realize that government officials are usually not good people, and government is far from transparent. I absolutely loathe politics because it is so obvious that it&#39;s a huge act. I have a lot of different views. </p>

<p>But I can still realize that without a government, without police, without many of the organizations we have, this country would most likely turn to shit. Don&#39;t get me wrong, it could  be A LOT better. But we are better off than a huge majority of the world. </p>

<p>Nobody thanks the government for anything. They just wait around for an opportunity to attack them, and that makes me sad. </p>
