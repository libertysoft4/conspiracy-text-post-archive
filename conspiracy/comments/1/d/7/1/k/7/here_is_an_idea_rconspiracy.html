<p>That&#39;s the perfect suggestion for most of the trolls that infest this sub. The same trolls come here again and again and again using every logical fallacy in the book and, in spite of being called out on it, they just keep coming with the same distraction tactics and disinformation. One gets tired of trying to have reasonable discussions with such people.</p>

<p>Edit: I tried for years to engage them politely but nowadays I mostly ignore or call them out, downvote and move on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love counter arguments.  They&#39;re the life blood of actual learning.  This subreddit has thus far disappointed me, not because I&#39;m sitting around and unable to dismiss conspiracies so I attack the theorists, but because if I state I don&#39;t believe in a popular theory, I am actually attacked for it.  I&#39;m not a big follower of conspiracy theories, but I am open to new ideas.  One way not to convert me to your ideas is to attack me, rather than provide how you came to disagree with me.</p>

<p>In other words, if conspiracy theorists want to not be attacked by those they disagree with, can we agree it is wholly reasonable for them to not attack those they disagree with?  A discussion, or an argument, has two sides.  As a skeptic, I&#39;d like to be able to post and know that my comment will be judged by the arguments and content I present, rather than whether or not I&#39;m agreeing with a popular theory.<br/>
PS: Shill accusation is a stupid thing that shouldn&#39;t exist.  Whether they exist or not is completely irrelevant, because if we would judge comments and posts by how they provide evidence for their case, they&#39;d simply be downvoted into oblivion every time they claimed something without evidence. </p>

If people can&#39;t win an argument they bring up &quot;Crisis actors&quot; as if everyone here believes in that.  They chide everyone for believing something so heinous.

<p>to be fair in real life this happens as well. i consider every conversation an arguement of some sort. my girlfriend hates this. haha.  i have a friend who i have debated with for years and still it will come to a point in our conversations where he will resort to - you said something stupid once when you were 15 and i still remember it, im going to attack with that instead of arguing - </p>

<p>usually thats when our arguements end. i believe in all arguements, that when someone name calls or resorts to devaluing your own  person, then you already have won the arguement</p>

<p>I also would like to see more expertise. We&#39;ve got 130k people subbed. There HAS to be people here that are experts in something relevant to what we talk about. What we need is a set of official goto people. </p>

<p>A prime example is all of the photos looking at blast damage. I hope we can all come to agreement that someone drawing with MS paint should not be considered reliable or accurate.

<p>Neither are fact, both are subjective perspectives. </p>

<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_media_ownership">handful of giant corporations</a> own the majority of global mainstream media, this fact is indisputable.  Those corporations often have a direct conflict of interest about the news they are reporting on.  </p>

<p><strong>MSNBC</strong> - Owned by General Electric, makers of military hardware, GiJoe, Barbie and consumer appliances.</p>

<p><strong>CBS</strong> - Owned by Westinghouse, makers of military hardware, Nuclear Plants and consumer appliances.</p>

<p><strong>Fox</strong> - Owned by Murdoch, also owns Dow Jones and was on the board of directors at Phillip Morris. Currently facing corruption charges. Went to court in the US and won the right to lie in the news.</p>

<p><strong>Disney/ABC</strong> - Produced America&#39;s WW2 Military Propaganda, Disney also personally testified to the FBI against alleged hollywood communists. </p>

<p>Would you trust &quot;Westinghouse News&quot;? How about &quot;General Electric 24/7&quot;?  </p>

<p>Add to that the <em>fact</em> that the US government has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird">directly influencing the media</a> since at least the 50s.  </p>

<p>Is it any wonder that so many people here treat the MSM with skepticism?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a few things here - </p>

<p>NBC was owned by GE (is no longer), but they have nothing to do with Mattel or Hasbro (makers of Barbie and GI Joe)...</p>

<p>CBS hasn&#39;t been owned by Westinghouse since 2000. It&#39;s now independently owned.</p>

<p>Fox is owned by Murdoch, and he does also own Dow Jones. But his ability to control the narrative of FNC is somewhat limited - evidenced by his personal support of gun control.</p>

<p>You&#39;re connecting ABC&#39;s activities with things that the Disney corporation did 60+ years ago, and personal actions of it&#39;s long-dead founder?</p>

<p>So yes the media organisations obviously have large corporate interests, but if you&#39;ve ever worked in the media you&#39;ll understand how unlikely and impractical it is that the content of news can be influenced on a day-to-day article-by-article basis by corporate owners. They exercise their influence in their hiring mainly (see Ailes as head of Fox News) but that is broad strokes.</p>

<p>For the most part they are driven entirely by ratings and advertising revenue which in turn requires that they report engaging news in a timely and exciting fashion. When there is broad consensus between news organisations it seems fairly safe to assume they are reporting honestly (with a trade off for timing etc - as seen by absurd inaccuracies reported in breaking new situations when information is confused and unclear). </p>

<p>To simply write off everything that comes from a mainstream source is then, surely, to suggest that literally thousands of journalists are somehow in on something and all conspiring together to report the same misinformation, right? That seems implausible on balance, and absurd if you actually know any journalists, or work even remotely close to the industry.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious that the officials frequently don&#39;t accurately communicate everything they know, and even lie or mislead at times, but I tend to think you do yourself and injustice by immediately declaring anything from an official source to be disinformation or spin.</p>

<p>My point is that in the last two weeks, all these images were coming into this subreddit from 4chan, and being pretty much accepted:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cj2zm/another_one_from_4chan/">Here</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1chjy8/4chan_spots_a_suspect/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1clmie/4chan_solved_the_boston_bombing/">here</a> as examples. Here is a l<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=4chan&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on">ist</a> of many more.</p>

<p>The comments criticise the posts, rightly so, because that should be the starting point. If the theory stands up to criticism, it is worth holding on to. But the titles &#39;4chan solves the Boston Bombings&#39;, c&#39;mon. That is just juvenile.  </p>

<p>Frankly, my fear is not being killed in a bombing, it is looking concerned in a still photograph near a bombing, because the internet might label me a terrorist. </p>

<p>That is a valid concern, certainly vigilantism is a horrid business. I&#39;m afraid it is what happens when citizens no longer trust in the criminal justice system.  </p>

<p>Such distrust is not unfounded, as I am sure you are aware. The governmental-military-financial system is <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/everything-is-rigged-the-biggest-financial-scandal-yet-20130425">corrupt at the highest levels</a>. Millions are imprisoned for non-violent crimes, while vast criminal enterprises are deemed too big to fail.  </p>

<p>In such a situation, where &quot;the people&quot; are receiving taxation without representation, while the rich wage class war against the poor, is it so surprising that so many doubt the official line? </p>

<p>I have no doubt that the bombs exploded, I have no doubt that people were hurt, I have no doubt that this is a tragedy. Which is exactly why it would be so upsetting if the tragedy were being manipulated for political gain.  </p>

<p>Hell, even if everything went down exactly as the MSM says it did, whichever way they finally decide upon, there are some really important questions that need to be answered here. If the suspects really were <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=1wZoCIydCgg">recruited by the FBI</a>, and if <a href="http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2013/April/Russia-Warned-US-Boston-Suspect-a-Follower-of-Islam/">Russia really did warn the US about them</a>, exactly how much did the US know? Were the <a href="http://www.local15tv.com/news/local/story/UM-Coach-Bomb-Sniffing-Dogs-Spotters-on-Roofs/BrirjAzFPUKKN8z6eSDJEA.cspx">rooftop spotters and bomb dogs</a> there on a specific lead?  What were &quot;<a href="http://www.kavkazcenter.com/eng/content/2013/04/21/17675.shtml">The Craft</a>&quot; doing there? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have the answers, I don&#39;t even know if these are the right questions. To dismiss people as heartless for questioning the official story, to belittle people for having the audacity of fact checking, is to say the least, not productive.    </p>

<p>Maybe I missed something but did any of the &#39;internet investigators&#39; and their photo speculations lead to any arrests? More importantly, I don&#39;t see how realistic it is to worry about being labeled a terrorist by internet sleuths, surely there are far more important things to be concerned with.  </p>

<p>No, the police are actually experienced in investigations. </p>

<p>As a tangent, these are two distinct things.  All too often people label straight insults as an ad hominem attack.</p>

<p>Insult - &quot;You&#39;re a douche because you&#39;re wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>Ad Hominem - &quot;You&#39;re wrong because you&#39;re a douche.&quot;</p>

<p>Just because someone calls you a name doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s an ad hominem.  There needs to be the backwards reasoning that because of whatever attack, you&#39;re therefore wrong.  If you logically refute someone&#39;s claim, then call them an idiot that&#39;s just adding an insult on the end of your argument which while rude, isn&#39;t an ad hominem.</p>

<p>You might not like it, but the stark reality is that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/MURICA/comments/1cigdg/this_fella_is_a_true_murican_eat_it_rpolitics/c9gxj64">reddit is gamed</a>, and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/1d679d/suspended_animation_explains_the_recent/">paid shills exist</a>.   </p>

<p>Reddit is the biggest social news site on the net,  it drives global news cycles, it is big business.  Barrack Obama did an AMA for fucks sake.  Do you really think the PUSA would show up anywhere without the SS and PR?</p>

<p>I understand that there are closed minded people on all sides, but there is an important distinction between being closed minded, and being paid to have an opinion. </p>

<p>If someone is paid to say the sky is red, it doesn&#39;t matter how much proof you show them, or how eloquently you raise your points.  They will keep saying the sky is red, and show you industry statistics to prove it. It won&#39;t win you over, but they don&#39;t care, because you aren&#39;t the target audience. Its all the people who read without commenting who are the target audience. All those people come past and see a debate going on, so naturally the truth must be somewhere in the middle.  Suddenly you have thousands of people doubting whether the sky is blue, and a general consensus forming that its probably purple.  </p>

<p>Crazy blue skiers, nuttier than a bag of fruitcake. Can you believe they actually think they know better than the experts? </p>

<p>If asked politely with a real and fair discussion in mind, then they should not. If asked  in a demeaning or condescending manner, then they should.
