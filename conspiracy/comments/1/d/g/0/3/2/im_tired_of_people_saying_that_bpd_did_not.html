<p>I&#39;m so sick of these trolls or whatever that come in here and try to justify  the fact that swat teams were FORCING people out of their homes <em>at gunpoint</em> to look for one alleged 19 year old terrorist. It is absolutely inane. What the fuck happened to this country? Why do so many people think this is ok??</p>

<p>For <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">reference</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, <strong><em>and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>EDIT: And as for the people saying this was &quot;reasonable&quot; (by whatever definition they want to apply), <strong>you would still need to get a warrant</strong> so your argument is completely invalid.  If the situation was as dire as the media portrayed, I&#39;m sure it would have been easy as pie to get a warrant from any judge who would want the publicity for himself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fucking agree with you. If you are inside your house safe why have a team of goons at gunpoint search your house and treat you like a criminal yelling at you to keep your hands up then violate you by patting you down for the apparent reason of a 19 year old missing kid who they know the identity of. It is insane and completely absurd..</p>

<p>See the picture of the guy in the Hummer to the right?  THAT guy gets to determine things for you now.  That person and his opinion which is influenced entirely by people in higher places gets to determine life or death over the population he is to &quot;protect&quot;. He, who probably is jacked up on &#39;roids and who watched Rambo the night before gets armored up and given an AR15 with a scope and the &quot;responsibility&quot; of &quot;protecting&quot; the other troops as they patrol your streets.  Don&#39;t get in their way though!  Don&#39;t question!  They might slip up.......shoot a hundred bullets into your boat or house thinking the &quot;bad guys&quot; are holed up inside.  The thin blue lines protects them from those mistakes and you and I get fucked right up the goat ass.</p>

<p>Those guys lose their rights and freedoms as soon as they&#39;re done playing army but pfft, who fucking cares right!  They&#39;re out saving the world from the huge amount of terrorists that are roaming our cities.  No time for straight honest thinking!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you surprised?
The next day after the bombings there was military police on the street checking people&#39;s ID&#39;s, and they didn&#39;t know who the bomber was yet.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/2013/04/16/day-after-marathon-blasts-investigation-continues/4oQaszf1BWu0XIGFlNAOHN/story.html?pic=26">http://www.bostonglobe.com/2013/04/16/day-after-marathon-blasts-investigation-continues/4oQaszf1BWu0XIGFlNAOHN/story.html?pic=26</a></p>

<p>MILITARY POLICE! Policing a city... The last time when the army had something to do with police in my country was when we were under communist dictatorship. That is a hallmark of a communist totalitarian dictatorship state.</p>

<p>This was 100% martial law in all but name and without a proper reason. Using only 100% civilian police and detectives the same result and work could have been done without trampling over peoples rights. Beat cops and detectives are used to dealing fairly with citizens. SWAT, FBI tactical teams, ATF, the army, and all those agencies tactical teams aren&#39;t. They will not take your rights into consideration because they are not trained to do so. Usually by the time they are deployed, someone else has done the proper initial front line work(talk to people, gather information, get warrants) to assure that tactical&#39;s deployment will be constitutional and legal.</p>

<p>THIS TIME THEY WERE THE FRONT LINE! The only place where the front line in policing are combat troops(SWAT and tactical fit the bill) is a war zone. For a few days Boston was a war zone.</p>

<p>Still not sure if it was incompetence at leadership level due to paralyzing fear or just a test for future things to come.</p>

<p>So those military IRAQ style searches of buildings where every civilian was considered hostile where just a natural next step. I wonder what the next step after this will be... hope we never get to see it...</p>

It&#39;s important to remember that while the public is stressing about gas prices and how dumb honey boo boo is....these people are designing and selling you your own enslavement. This is chess, not checkers. They have been setting up for this crap for decades......WAKE THE FUCK UP! Learn your recent history, and then complain about all the rights being stripped away.

The majority of regular folks have bought into the illusion of choice (red or blue) and will bury their head in the sand of that side vehemently. Second, not trying to sound like a dick, but I posted this information to help. It&#39;s a waste of energy to fight something that no longer is valid in this case. They made the Constitution Free Zone several years ago, and then this happened in that zone. The people knew about it, but shrugged it off as if it wasn&#39;t going to affect them (like they always do). Well guess what...it&#39;s affecting them now and everybody&#39;s pissed at the government when they SHOULD be pissed at themselves for allowing this to happen years ago. As previously stated, this is chess not checkers. Learn recent history, and pay attention- just because a bill passes today doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t wait a few years for everyone to forget about it before they start showing it in action. Heaven forbid they start using the patriot act to it&#39;s full potential.....Boston was a drop in a barrel compared to the shit in THAT piece of work.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right, thats what I&#39;m saying. It doesn&#39;t take a majority to prevail, just a small group of people who are awake and driven to waking up others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. And this where, I think, the problem stems from....</p>

<p>People are too busy. There&#39;s no time to pay attention, I&#39;ve got to go to work at a job I loathe to make money to pay bills I shouldn&#39;t need, then I gotta take my daily or weekly dose of TV to escape my reality. The people don&#39;t take time to critically think about ANYTHING, or they&#39;ve been pigeon holed into a situation where most people can&#39;t.</p>

<p>&quot;Dancing with the stars is on!! I better go take my 30 minute dose of &#39;Beautiful people&#39;. Then I take my 30 minute dose of &#39;I can sing better than that!&#39; when American Idol comes on.&quot;</p>

<p>There&#39;s been 2 entire generations grow up in this country being indoctrinated to think like drones, and act like drones, and soon they&#39;ll also be &quot;protected&quot; by drones. They want people smart enough to RUN the machines, but not smart enough to ask WHY they have to run them. You can&#39;t force people to think. You can&#39;t force people to understand that. The only you can do is watch their moves, and plan accordingly. THIS IS CHESS. The more you people try to point up at the hill and bitch about things, the less time you have to be positioning your pieces for either defense or a counter strike. There is enough evidence on the board now to expose their strategy, be smart enough to look out for your self by studying it and seeing what the next move is going to be so YOU can either circumvent it before it happens or protect yourself WHEN it happens.</p>

<p>I know, you&#39;re only on reddit talking about this stuff because you WANT to HELP people!! I get it! I want to Help people too!! You gotta realize though, that some people don&#39;t want to be helped. They&#39;re perfectly happy soaking up all the good times and prosperity as long as they can, only to be blindsided when TSHTF. And some people might want help, but want to wait until it&#39;s too late to ask for it. These people see it, but they want to soak up all the good times too, they don&#39;t understand that their &quot;greed&quot; will be their downfall. </p>

<p>It&#39;s okay to be compassionate, but be smart about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couldn&#39;t have said any of that better myself. This is, almost verbatim, what I tell people constantly. That we&#39;re intentionally kept too busy to care. That we should be cultivating lives we don&#39;t feel the need to escape from with weekends, vacations, and TV time. That our education system is designed to create soldiers, not thinkers. That the only way to combat the rising tyranny is to remove our dependence on the machine. Grow gardens, foster community interdependence, stop paying taxes. Non-violent, non-cooperation. Stay calm and starve the beast. </p>

<p>And chess is my favorite game. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad to know there&#39;s at least one other person out there delivering the same message. Actually, I&#39;ve encountered an encouragingly robust number of similar mindsets, but as you mentioned, a lot of them are reactive about it. The toughest part, in my experience, is inclining people to think proactively about this situation, before it&#39;s too late. It may be already. </p>

<p>How do you think communism started in my country? Simple: &quot;Look, WW2 is over, Soviet Russia has won this side of Europe, they will make us their slaves, just accept us, the Romanian Communist Party(People&#39;s Party) and give us absolute power because the soviets trust us and we&#39;ll keep you safe from the worst of what they have planned for this country. We just want the best that can be achieved under the current circumstances to keep you and this country as safe as it can be.&quot;</p>

<p>Same principle, 70 years ago with other actors. </p>

<p>And even so, in &#39;79 my father had a neighbor that was tech savvy and built his own radio transmitter and was tuning in and transmitting on the police(called the &quot;militia&quot;) channel by accident. EVEN SO, a nice militia man came to his house, rang the door bell, patiently waited until someone came to the door and asked them politely if they can come in, discuss the situation and dismantle the equipment. AT NO POINT WAS THERE ANY GUN DRAWN. IN A FULLY TOTALITARIAN COMMUNIST STATE.</p>

<p>Good luck America! You are going to need it!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hot pursuit has long formed a part of English common law as one of the exceptions to the castle doctrine which affords owners of private property protection against the intrusion of government agents as well as civilian trespassers. As such, it has been exported to many former colonies of the British Empire, including the United States and Canada.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too difficult to understand how exceptional the Boston case is unless you are of the type who is convinced that (nearly) any government action is a coordinated effort to destroy liberty. When was the last time a serial murderer using improvised explosives was at large and being pursued in an urban area?</p>

<p>If the authorities knew where the suspect was the searches would be unwarranted. If the authorities weren&#39;t dealing with what potentially could have been a serious terrorist threat, the searches would be unwarranted. But the combination of the two outweighs your right to be king of the castle. If you don&#39;t like the possibility of living in a specific neighborhood of a specific city in the country and having your apartment swept once in a lifetime, you had better not choose your castle in those neighborhoods.</p>

<p>That said, if there was a bomb-making murderer in my small town and the cops weren&#39;t going door to door to find them and make sure they weren&#39;t holding hostages anywhere, I would put together a posse and do it myself.</p>

<p>Now you can argue whether the official reason was true or not, but what I have been saying is <em>assuming</em> the official account is true, I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s rights were unjustly infringed.

    <div class="md"><p>It was expected by people who have been keeping up with events over the past 10 years. There&#39;s no official news source to my knowledge, I just knew something like this would be coming to justify what comes next, which is to reenforce the idea that we need to be disarmed.  -and of course turn us against one another, cops don&#39;t have to do a damn thing if we&#39;re busting each others doors down. (hint hint)</p>

<p>It was predicted that they would go after black powder after this incident and sure enough they are. These attacks aren&#39;t going to stop either. Not until the American people are so demoralized  that they will gladly give up their rights just to make it stop.</p>

<p>A quick Google search &quot;bill to ban reloading powder&quot; shows lots of places are attempting to pursue bills. There&#39;s also symbolism in selecting Boston. Lots of battles have been fought in Boston however it&#39;s where rebels put up a sight to secure a cache of weapons in 1770 as stated i another post yesterday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean by serial terrorist, that makes no sense, At the time They had a suspect of the bombing on the loose. He was not a serial Terrorist. 
&quot; If they had not Boston would still be under increased security today until the suspect was uncovered&quot;.
What are you talking about they called off the search and said the lockdown was over at 5pm, If they never found him shit would have gone back to basically how it was before they Identified him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The possibilities are endless and we can all argue why one situation works and another doesn&#39;t and vice versa. What bothers me. Is that the Federal government has gotten so big, so consuming, that the citizen no longer has a right to anything. Sure they SAY you do. But when injustice happens, everyone seems to look the other way and just go &quot;well it wasn&#39;t me.&quot; I&#39;m scared for a nation that employs more people by giving them a rifle and conditioning them to just take orders and that any resistance to those orders is viewed as treason and reason to be killed on the spot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why constant vigilance is essential.</p>

<p>Too much military power and our government risks tyranny. Too little military power and our society risks security.</p>

<p>Too little scrutiny and we allow corruption. Spurious scrutiny and we cause harm to legitimate authority and provide cover through obscurity for corruption.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a balancing act and one that is and has always been the price for living in a free society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see your point and I respect that it is the price we pay, However I think too little benefit too greatly for us to believe we have the best system we can have. Too many backwards things going on and it&#39;s just getting worse. The justifications for losing rights only increase and I&#39;m afraid that we will be another rome or another germany. Humanity will look back on the legacy of the freedom nation known as America and will hardly learn from the fall of it&#39;s empire. I get the balance and check society we live in, but it&#39;s starting to implode on itself. Too much complications, Too much corruption, too much fear compelling citizens to be fed by a nanny state.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your civil tone. I don&#39;t suppose I should have to say it, but I feel like I&#39;m in enemy territory. I listen to mainstream media and alternative media on both sides of the political spectrum (Democracy Now, 2600, No Agenda, Alex Jones). I like to be critical of all media, because all of it, even the independents, sometimes especially the independents, have an agenda.</p>

<p>It struck me as I was reading your response that it reminded me of &quot;All Along the Watchtower.&quot; Yeah, the federal government is scary because it&#39;s a huge bureaucracy that no one person can oversee, let alone the worries that the people who do oversee it have our best interests at heart.</p>

<p>The problem I have is jumping to the conclusions. Alex Jones, for instance, called this all a false flag all the way back on April 15. How could he know that at that point? Even if it turns out to be, these kind of wild speculations drown out real whistleblowers with actual evidence.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t really collapse the size of the government by a significant amount. We may be able to cut it by say a quarter if we were willing to live with fewer services, but even then the remaining bureaucracy would still be massive, and paradoxically, even more blindly loyal. In other words, 8,000 FEMA employees in the place of 10,000 might actually be more susceptible to conspiracy, corruption and greed.</p>

<p>The only way to protect our selves is through the media. Journalistic ethics do not allow for alarmist messages because they reduce credibility. Ultimately, news broadcasters value their credibility more than most people in this sub would realize. The people who want to cry false flag at every emergency are entitled, but they aren&#39;t journalist, they are commentators. </p>

<p>Gossip is a dangerous thing. Not because muzzling it protects wrongdoers from scorn, but because it might actually shield the actual wrongdoers by deflecting the blame toward innocent or lesser players. The frustation I have with this sub is that (1) a lot of times that gossip is assumed to be news and people spread it as though it is and (2) it really is desensitizing to real problems. It leaves a society that just assumes everybody is up to no good and gives a pass to serious bad guys. I just find it ironic that people who distrust everything that comes out of a journalist mouth will buy everything that comes out one of these commentator&#39;s mouths. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t believe some of what they say is true, it&#39;s just that I frankly don&#39;t give them the credibility that I give to traditionally sourced news. Ultimately the only defense to the fall of empire that you are concerned about is not playing David and Goliath with the bureaucracy, but using our institution the media to keep it in check. I&#39;m just concerned that the instant jump to the message &quot;it&#39;s all corrupt&quot; is just as damaging if not more so than &quot;trust it all.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I appreciate the insight, It&#39;s harder for me to see my fellow peers say everything is as it they say it is, rather then them say &quot;It&#39;s all lies and corruption.&quot; Being critical of information is important and since we do not know everything, it&#39;s important for us to refine and revel in the information being brought to us by all parties. Sometimes my bias leads me to question everything I hear on major news sites, however it&#39;s the tone and words they use that infuriate me. When a certain picture is to be painted, and a mass majority gulps it up without question, I find a dangerous combination capable of creating a disastrous future. I hate to see people talk about events without going to other sources rather just listening to main stream one sided bullshit. It&#39;s just a sad nation where our education teaches us to follow rules rather then create our evolution through intellect refinement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I think all sides of any issue have too many people who look for one source as an authority on a subject.  In science, either a proposition is true or false. In politics, an act might be just given a premise that turns out to be false. That sort of uncertainty is intimidating to a lot of people.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say that a cadre of people actually orchestrated these attacks and have managed to obscure it from the masses. The other actors (police and national guard) become unknowing participants in a conspiracy. Sometimes when it comes to things like diplomacy, one party will lie to the other party and both parties will know it&#39;s a lie, but they will still negotiate using the lie as a premise, because maybe that lie covers up a truth that neither party wants to discuss.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just kind of conspiracied out. I don&#39;t doubt that there are hundreds of conspiracies all operating at the same time, sometimes colluding, sometimes competing, and I&#39;m not sure whether or not that is actually the heart of a representative democracy. The only concern I have is &quot;It&#39;s all lies.&quot; You know, most people in government can probably earn more in the private sector. Most of them are there for public service. Some are there to benefit private sector companies they will later rejoin.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you want to hire regulators and inspectors for the natural gas industry. Guess who you are going to hire? People from the natural gas industry. Why? Because they will know the most about the natural gas industry...how it works and where the bodies are buried. But when the administration changes, these people need jobs again. That&#39;s how you get former Halliburton and Monsanto and Goldman-Sachs employees in government regulating Halliburton, Monsanto and Goldman-Sachs.</p>

<p>So you can look at that and either say &quot;we got the best and most knowledgable regulators we could get&quot; or &quot;we hired regulators from the very firms they are supposed to regulate&quot; and sadly <em>they are both right</em>. The only way to fix that is to create stable good-paying non-spoils independent bureaucracy jobs for regulators, but then those people become beholden to bureaucratic loyalty. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the fact that there are certain truths we can all agree exist but we don&#39;t want to discuss because of how uncomfortable they make us feel. 
I always like to look at hollywood (because of their deep connections with politics and the elite) and look at the themes they play on in their movies. <em>The Matrix</em> was an amazing novel before movie, that showcased a society plugged into a false reality where the people believe in the consistencies and daily mishaps to be normal. Essentially being pulled out (or taking the red pill) would allow us to open our eyes and minds to the reality of the world we inhabit. Being fully aware that you cannot go back to a false reality without knowing that it is false. I love this premise because it reminds me of the mass of people who would rather remain ignorant and subconsciously use all sorts of argument to defend the system that does not promote their own evolution but keeps them dormant and submissive to the status quo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I had to argue with you on that, I&#39;d say we are all victims of our own Matrixs (matrices?). In some people&#39;s realities the government has no impact on thier life at all. For others, they feel like the course of  their entire life hangs in the balance of some innocuous decision. </p>

<p>You can live in a mindset where the government is always right and you can live in the mindset that government is always wrong. Neither of them are very healthy. My construct is that our government does pretty well for a giant human-run institution. Free of corruption? No chance. Potentially dangerous? Absolutely. Actively planning tyranny? Possibly in some corners. Worthy of overturning? Absolutely not. </p>

<p>You kinda have to give the government some benefit of the doubt. Not a blank check, but benefit of the doubt. Why? If not, you are assuming that this somewhat-corrupt government will be replaced by a better government. We could overthrow the government and end up with a full on totalitarian government. Sure, if we edge to close to totalitarianism, I&#39;d rather run them out than consent despite the uncertainty. But until there is proof of widespread treacherous conspiracy, I&#39;m going to assume that the evil acts of men are usually those of themselves alone and not a part of some elaborate scheme.  That doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t constantly watch out for that treachery. What it does mean is we should be careful about who we put that label on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I actually ment to reply to whydoyouhefftobemad.  I appreciate you answering though!  Well my guess is that the FBI, CIA, and ATF were all in close proximity to everything considering the Marathon had just happened on Monday.  They were still investigating the bombings which was like a 20 minute drive from where the shootout took place.  At least that&#39;s my explanation for why they were on scene so quickly.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what coordination you&#39;re talking about though..  Like the searching of the area?  I mean they let a 19 year old elude them for like 18 hours, I wouldn&#39;t consider them &quot;scarily welly coordinated,&quot; then lol.  Now had they swooped right in a found him within like 15 minutes of searching, that would be scary.. </p>

<p>EDIT: And as for the people saying this was &quot;reasonable&quot; (by whatever definition they want to apply), you would still need to get a warrant so your argument is completely invalid.

<p>Not necessarily. There are several circumstances in which a search or seizure is reasonable and requires no warrant whatsoever. Hot pursuit, exigent circumstances, plain view, etc. all authorize search or seizure without a warrant (or a valid warrant, for stuff like the good-faith exception).</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t saying you&#39;re wrong in this specific case, but that your assertion -- just the part I quoted -- was wrong in general. It may well be that this behavior falls outside the recognized exceptions to the warrant rule; we&#39;ll have to wait for the media hype to die down, and the s. 1983 suits to be filed and litigated. But it&#39;s not the case that a reasonable search necessarily needs a warrant, even if it is otherwise reasonable.</p>

<p>Executive Order 13603: National Defense Resource Preparedness</p>

<p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/16/executive-order-national-defense-resources-preparedness">http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/16/executive-order-national-defense-resources-preparedness</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m omiting parts of the document, for brevity, but I have not skewed any of the intent. Feel free to double check. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the authority vested in me as President..</p>

<p>Executive departments and agencies responsible for plans and programs relating to national defense, or for resources and services needed to support such plans and programs, shall...</p>

<p>...in peacetime and times of national emergency...</p>

<p>be prepared... to take actions necessary to ensure the availability of adequate resources [including subcontractors and suppliers, materials, skilled labor, and professional and technical personnel]...</p>

<p>...for national defense requirements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Take special note of the parts where it specifies the executive branch&#39;s right to ensure the availability of (i.e. to seize) any resources necessary for the sake of national defense...during <em>peacetime</em> or times of national emergency. </p>

<p>The Bill of Rights is pretty much void. This overrules most of it in one fell swoop. They can take what they want, when they want, without congressional approval (and later they use some tricky phrasing to immunize the affects of this order against judicial review, effectively separating them from both the judicial and legislative branches&#39; checks and balances). They also specify three councils in charge of determining when all of this can happen. All three councils are in the executive branch. So they only need their own permission to invade your homes, take your things, even take <em>you</em>. And it&#39;s all legal now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apologies if this comes across as offensive or anything. I&#39;m British so I obviously don&#39;t share the same rights and stuff but hear me out. I&#39;m not trying to argue hear I&#39;m just discussing :) but no doubt I&#39;ll get downvotes, oh well.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s required for them to do this? For example, the terrorist could have hidden inside and keeping the family hostage, or the resident could&#39;ve even been working with him and be armed, it&#39;s just not a situation where you can&#39;t take time. He could&#39;ve been placing a bomb or disposing of evidence or something like that. I mean it wasn&#39;t like they were arresting everyone when they entered the homes, they were simply ordering them out for their and the BPD teams safety. They can&#39;t exactly sit down, discuss it and ask them to leave, it&#39;s an emergency. If a genuine terrorist entered my home I&#39;d understand why I&#39;d be escorted out at gunpoint by the police, I could be armed and working with the guy for all they know. </p>

<p>At the end of the day the police are there to protect us, now I know the police here in the UK and over there are very different and you guys get a lot of police brutality issues but that&#39;s down to the police themselves, not what they can do in an emergency involving a terrorist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand, like I said you have different rights that us, as far as things go you people on the other side of the pond have much more freedom.</p>

<p>But surely you can see that what the BPD did was required? They don&#39;t have the time to go around getting a warrant for every house to search, that could give the suspect more time to kill people or escape so in order to save more lives, surely some sacrifices must be made? Like I said it&#39;s not like the residents were arrested, afterwards they resumed life just as normal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the rationale, but the reason stuff like that is not constitutional here is that it&#39;s too slippery a slope. If a state of emergency or a war has been declared, that&#39;s different because the threat is nationwide; lot&#39;s of people&#39;s lives at risk. In this case, no state of emergency had been declared and the threat was very isolated and limited. Even if the kid had a second bomb, or a firearm, and held a family hostage with it, that does not qualify as a state of emergency. Otherwise, they could call any ol&#39; thing an emergency, and maintain a constantly martialized society (which we actually do, since the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act, but that&#39;s another discussion). </p>

<p>I&#39;d be hard pressed to say where the line should be drawn, but a single household is certainly too small a danger to flippantly cast everyone&#39;s rights out the window. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. For all our lofty constitutionalities, we have already slid down that slope I mentioned. We are technically a plutocratic military corporatocracy at this point. Doesn&#39;t get much worse than that. IMO, the only thing worse is a fascist dictatorship, and we&#39;re headed there fast. Actually, we&#39;re headed toward a totalitarian dictatorship, I suppose, since our government seems to think it can impose its will on the entire world.</p>

<p>And what is it based on? Those people didn&#39;t have a connection to the terrorist, and they knew who he was at that point so they knew 100% those people were innocent.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not their fault either, doing that kind of first contact front line approach is not what they were trained for. They were trained for one thing only, breach a location already confirmed to need that kind of action. It&#39;s the leaderships fault for deploying them in that kind of situation.

    <div class="md"><p>The point is they are doing it as wrong as it can be done without actually going as far as shooting or arresting anyone.</p>

<p>There was no need for the search to be done this way at all. Waste of money, waste of time, breaking the law, scaring people, putting innocents into harm&#39;s way.</p>

<p>So many fugitives have been apprehended without actually needing to call the national guard and APCR&#39;s on the streets and wasting everyone&#39;s time, money and paralyzing an urban center for so many years before this. There was no need now either. But if they can get away with it, who knows what they will dare do next.</p>

<p>You have to wonder, if 2, maybe now 5 guys with a few pipe bombs can:
1. kill people
2. paralyze the lives of millions of people
3. make them lose their constitutional rights
4. evaporate hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars in money lost during this whole operation
5. tie up thousands of law enforcement and army personnel and hundreds of vehicles for a week at least
6. They and their cause became famous around the world.</p>

<p>You have to wonder if 2-5 guys just did this. Have these few guys won? What else could have been their objectives? I think they achieved what they set out to achieve, except maybe escape, which probably they regarded as a small chance anyway.</p>

<p>Are we all losing the war on terror because we are fighting it the wrong way? Are the terrorist actually winning? If this keeps up I do think we are fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly wish they had handled it differently, because I&#39;m sure many of the officers involved in this were merely doing their job..  Now many of them are catching flak for it.  I wonder how many officers complained about violating the people&#39;s rights, and I wonder what happened for doing so?  Not every authority figure is trying to program civilians to the sort of things that had taken place.  I hope you guys aren&#39;t blaming those who were genuinely trying to catch the kid.</p>

<p>Anyway, it sucks that shit went down the way it did.  This could have definitely been handled in a way that didn&#39;t violate people&#39;s rights..  Unfortunately the events of that night happened pretty quickly, and I assume they had <a href="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1op50i0Ie1rroyh2o1_500.gif">this guy</a> running things in Watertown.  While they did violate people&#39;s rights, at least they didn&#39;t go further than that.  They didn&#39;t illegally seize personal  belongings, try to pin something illegal(like drugs) on anyone, and left as quickly as they came.  It could have been worse.  To me that made me think it was less a conspiracy to prepare the public for this sorta stuff, but more likely poor decision making by those in command..  The worst part is we will never know for sure if they were doing it to actually find the kid, or train the public to accept this sorta thing..  Maybe they thought some crazy conspiracy theorist would give him safe haven because they believed the bros were set-up and amputees were used at the bombings?</p>

<p>What should have happened was have someone who can recite the constitution word for word to be in charge of the operations.  Secondly, don&#39;t demand to search the homes..  Simply ask the neighbors if they heard anyone trying to break in during the night.  If they say &quot;yes&quot; then authorities could ASK the residents for permission to do a walk through.  Otherwise move on to the next neighbor, rinse and repeat.  </p>

<p>I bet every gun owner had their gun by their side that night..  Quite obvious they didn&#39;t have to go home to home.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read your constitution. I&#39;m foreign and still know more.
They need to be in HOT pursuit or have credible evidence, sources and suspicious. Searching hundreds of houses seemingly at random, since some weren&#39;t searched, doesn&#39;t qualify.
They literally needed to see him run in the house or in the close area around the house to have any grounds for searching the house without consent from the owner. And pointing a rifle at his face and screaming at him to get his hands up, step outside and let them search the house does not qualify as consent. It is called coercion. You can see and hear more than enough in the video to prove that.</p>

<p>Beat cops and detectives would have been just as effective and wouldn&#39;t have stepped all over peoples rights, that&#39;s what they are paid for and trained to do. No need for military police, SWAT and different agencies&#39;s tactical teams with armored vehicles, that are not trained to interact with civilians, to be doing the beat cops and detectives jobs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s my Constitution and since you are such a scholar, you should know that the Fourth Amendment has been interpreted by our state and federal courts to permit certain exceptions.  ONE of those exceptions is emergency or hot pursuit the other is consent.  This video does not prove there was not consent to search that house.   </p>

<p>Furthermore, we aren&#39;t talking about a kid who just robbed a convenience store. Acts of terror are acts of war.  This kid was suspected - is still suspected - of being a terrorist in possession of bombs capable of causing widespread damage.  This creates a public safety emergency that might qualify as a fourth amendment exception.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? Without a prior court ruling you cant just say that going into someones home when they are gone..without consent doesnt constitute a violation? Nothing is wrong with going door to door and asking questions ..that is standard practice in an investigation. Look for signs of distress then send in SWAT. We skipped the lets talk to the home owner part. They didnt even catch the guy. a normal home owner did. All of it achieved nothing but now that they did it once of course they will do it again.</p>

<p>My question was, &#39;have authorities done this before and when? Is there prior case law on the question?&#39; And that relates to the issue of whether this is a 4th amendment violation because the SC decides those issues per their right of constitutional arbitration. If there is longstanding case law, then this issue was decided long ago. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know the answer to that question. But I note that no one has been asking it. All I read is a bunch of blanket outrage without any consideration for prior case law. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if was actually in breach of the 4th ammendment, you could sue... Otherwise the only thing its in breach of is your personal opinion on what constitutes the laws of the United States of America. Which carries literally no weight whatsoever... While i have no doubt you are qualified on constitutional interpretation, thats actually a job for the courts, not you.</p>

<p>So stick your money where your mouth is and take them to court, see how you go :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just so ironic to me that people advocate <strong>people with guns</strong> coming to your house and forcing you to leave <strong>to protect you from someone with a gun</strong> (although now the story has changed and they say he didn&#39;t have a gun in the boat).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care what you do. You can let people go in your house and search, that would not be a violation of the 4th amendment. But the second you try to justify the nullification of that rule (which LEO&#39;s all swore an oath to) by saying there are &#39;extenuating circumstances&#39; and you would condone them kicking my door down if I did not comply, you are just as dangerous as the terrorists you are trying to protect other people from (while sitting in your swivel chair).  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hot pursuit has long formed a part of English common law as one of the exceptions to the castle doctrine which affords owners of private property protection against the intrusion of government agents as well as civilian trespassers. As such, it has been exported to many former colonies of the British Empire, including the United States and Canada.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too difficult to understand how exceptional the Boston case is unless you are of the type who is convinced that (nearly) any government action is a coordinated effort to destroy liberty. When was the last time a serial murderer using improvised explosives was at large and being pursued in an urban area?</p>

<p>If the authorities knew where the suspect was the searches would be unwarranted. If the authorities weren&#39;t dealing with what potentially could have been a serious terrorist threat, the searches would be unwarranted. But the combination of the two outweighs your right to be king of the castle. If you don&#39;t like the possibility of living in a specific neighborhood of a specific city in the country and having your apartment swept once in a lifetime, you had better not choose your castle in those neighborhoods.</p>

<p>That said, if there was a bomb-making murderer in my small town and the cops weren&#39;t going door to door to find them and make sure they weren&#39;t holding hostages anywhere, I would put together a posse and do it myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They dealt with the situation as it came...they had a serial terrorist on the loose and flushed him out and captured him. If they had not Boston would still be under increased security today until the suspect was uncovered. If there was a third attack, Boston would be under martial law. They came, they saw, they did their job, and got the fuck out...isn&#39;t that the textbook case for needing SWAT teams and national guards?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But if there would have been beat cops used, instead of SWAT and federal tactical teams, be sure they would have been flaunting that warrant in the face of everyone coming out of that house. Because they are trained to do things like that, these guys aren&#39;t. They also aren&#39;t trained to get warrants, I doubt any of them know how to.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m quite sure there is no warrant. And how do you know they didn&#39;t ask? You can&#39;t hear that, all you can hear is the shouting of commands and the radios.</p>
