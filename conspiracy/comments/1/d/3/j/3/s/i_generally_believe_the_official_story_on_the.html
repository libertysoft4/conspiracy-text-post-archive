        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>OK i havent seen any reddit posts about this specific thing and believe me when I say I&#39;ve been obsessed with anything and everything Boston bombing since it happened. I&#39;ve combed thru all the different theories in detail, and I still think I generally agree with the official story, or at least i&#39;ve been trying to convince myself of the brothers&#39; guilt since the blog with the shootout pics surfaced. </p>

<p>Anyway, my opinion on the events is 100% irrelevant and not the point of this post. Whether the brothers were guilty or not will not be the focus from here on out. Please focus ONLY on the evidence that is presented in this link, and let&#39;s discuss.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cluesforum.info/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=1602&amp;start=525#p2383558">HERE IS THE LINK</a></p>

<p>Again, forget about the brothers and the bombing for a moment here. WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT HUGE SCREEN?! why is it in plenty of official marathon photos but none of the bomb footage? could they really dismantle that huge thing that quickly (meaning between the time the race winners photos are snapped with it in the background and the bomb footage with it clearly not there)?!? </p>

<p>This is REALLY bothering me and I can not come up with a rational explanation for it.....</p>

<p>Edit: as people have brought to my attention in the comments, it appears the sign was brought in attached to a truck, and was mounted to a pole/bracket type contraction which can indeed be seen in the post explosion footage. </p>

<p>Top comment has a picture of the sign from someone standing across the street from it.</p>

<p>The sign was easily removable, and the popular theory below seems to be that once all the famous runners were finished, the screen was no longer needed as the &quot;main attraction&quot;, so to speak, had concluded. Also things like excessive wind, etc are mentioned. Either way, I think we all agree they simply came in and took it down at some point. I just didn&#39;t realize how &quot;portable&quot; it was.</p>

<p>Alternatively, and I believe less likely, they moved it between the time the race was won and the time the bombs went off.  I imagine they point of the monitor was to give a live feed of the race, and once everyone&#39;s coming in for the finish you don&#39;t need the monitor to do that any longer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Just because you weren&#39;t one of the elite runners that doesn&#39;t mean you couldn&#39;t have won it. </p>

<p>Sometimes the favorites don&#39;t win. And when that happens, when the local middle-aged dad running for charity smashes the world record, we&#39;re supposed to believe the TV wouldn&#39;t want to show him up on the big screen?</p>

<p>Come on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re telling me that the <em>only</em> reason anybody would want to watch the race, is to see the winner? That makes no sense whatsoever. If they paid that much money for a huge screen, why take it down mid-race? It&#39;s not about the winner, it&#39;s simply about watching the race. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I&#39;m not saying that at all. I agree with you that something&#39;s fishy.</p>

<p>On marathon day Boston TV stations show uninterrupted coverage until the last person has crossed the finish line.</p>

<p>To tell you the truth the people finishing at the end are a helluva lot more interesting to watch then the so-called &#39;elites&#39;.  Sometimes they shit themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha! Thank you for having a little bit of humor. I actually don&#39;t think anything is fishy about the monitor itself, I just question the timing of taking it down. It seems a little dangerous to take a huge screen like that down, with a couple hundred people milling around, while the race is still in progress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Re: the missing screen, the elite runners will be HOURS before everyone else hence the empty streets. The bombs went off at the almost 4 hour mark and these elite runners were at the 2 hour mark.  I had a friend about 100m from the finish line and his gf had just crossed so that is the timing of an &#39;average&#39; runner....</p>

<p>There is plenty of time to take down the screen showing the elite runners in that time span. I can ask him if he recalls a screen being up when he was almost to the finish line but he is pretty traumatized and hasn&#39;t been interested in talking about what happened...</p>

<p>I am open to many of the theories about the bombing, I&#39;m just trying to stick to the facts around the missing screen.</p>

<p>Never mind...</p>

<p>There are two different races in these pictures.  The one that has &quot;5K&quot; under the time indicator shows that the top big monitor is just above the top of the third story windows, the picture that has additional text under the time indicator shows the top of the big monitor right under the bottom os the fourth story windows.</p>

<p>Maybe that could be parallax given the two different camera locations but if it <em>is</em> parallax it means that the big monitor isn&#39;t mounted on the building, it would be some distance away.</p>
