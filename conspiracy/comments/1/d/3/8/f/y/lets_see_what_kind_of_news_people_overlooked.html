<p>So FINALLY we get some bipartisan support for something in congress and the president even signs it, too bad the only thing it did was gut many provisions in the Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge act that finally put some guidelines and reporting in place for insider trading happening in D.C. Yep thats right people, you shouldn&#39;t insider trade (hell they even put Martha Stewart behind bars for this) but the people &quot;Serving our Republic&quot; in D.C. can. So fuck you!</p>

<p>Also, one of the papers that most people bring up to support gutting the funding for public services in time of debt to GDP ratio of over 1:1 was just proven to be based on incorrect excel usage. Also they did not include many countries that have been successful in super high debt situations. </p>

<p>Austerity cheerleaders have a chink in their armor. Im not saying debt is good, but the reasons these powerful people have been sighting for wanting to cut public spending are bogus. </p>

<p>What interested me the most about the situation with the Harvard paper is that it was a student at a university that discovered the error. I wonder how many other &quot;Scientific&quot; papers that are used as reasons to do terrible shit are based on errors. Does anyone know of any others in recent news?</p>

<p>I realize these aren&#39;t conspiracies, but they show how politicians use an event like the bombings to flood the news and not let stuff like this see the light of day.</p>

<p>As far as this sub is concerned, I think what happened in the case with the Harvard paper can be applied to lots of things, next time you hear someone citing a fancy non peer reviewed paper to try and convince the sheep of something, someone (this sub) should sleuth and investigate. This is how you can build a case, with data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, this stuff is the real conspiracy. Except its out in the open. Instead people talk about lizard people or birth certificates. I wish half the effort to find and debunk obamas birth certificate were focused on something like this, or Citizens United. </p>
