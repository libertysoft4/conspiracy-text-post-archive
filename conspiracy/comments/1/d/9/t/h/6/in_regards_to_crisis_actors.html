        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I do think that the Boston bombing stinks to high heaven of something shady going down. The story just doesn&#39;t add up. Same with Sandy Hook, something about it doesn&#39;t seem right either. I don&#39;t have proof or a shitty youtube video to outline my theory, that&#39;s just what I think.</p>

<p>Now. In regards to crisis actors involved with either event, I think it is mostly bullshit. Here is why.</p>

<p>If any of you have been following conspiracies for a while, you will know that the people who design any false flag don&#39;t give a fuck about hiring actors to make things more believable. Why do that when you can just kill them? </p>

<p>An actor involves too much secrecy and too big of a chance that something will leak. The idea that the government would plan a false flag and hire actors is ridiculous. If they plan a false flag, people are dying. They won&#39;t even bat an eye.</p>

<p>NOW.
I do think there is a possibility that actors are placed for witness interviews or something like that. Or maybe someone is planted to control the narrative for propaganda purposes. </p>

<p>But, from everything I have seen, there is absolutely no reason the government or it&#39;s agencies would care if anyone died or not. 9/11 anyone? </p>

<p>By the way, 9/11 did happen and A LOT of people died. And yes, I do think we in the very LEAST let it happen. </p>

<p>So let&#39;s move on from the whole crisis actor theory. Shit&#39;s weak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Notice that in this actors theory no one has ever articulated a conspiracy theory to explaiin the elephant in the livingroom - the lives. </p>

<p>How do they interrupt real lives? People died. People that were know to be full bodied are now amputees. </p>

<p>How do you make that happen without it being real? </p>

<p>So- to attempt a conspiracy theory, for the sake of argument, lets pretend that the &quot;spy agency&quot; part of the job is to conjur up fictitious people. SO the idea would be that the victims never really existed and no one really knows them they just assume other people do. </p>

<p>How about the case of a Jeff Bauman, under this conspiracy theory? He has to I guess go on with this identity? There has to be a Jeff Bauman with no legs from now on? </p>

<p>I can&#39;t imagine a conspiracy to explain that last problem.  You would have to have a guy who lost his legs recently and people didn&#39;t know,  about it, and haven&#39;t seen him recently and this new thing is spliced over the real event in his life. </p>

<p>Anyone got any better tricks to make that happen?  This is where the Actors thing totally just falls apart, and you end up looking like a fool for even considering the ugly idea.  I hate to put it that way.  I don&#39;t want to discourage anyone&#39;s conspiracy theory, I want to encourage them. Do you just need a core team of liars that claim they knew him and live the lie from now on? </p>

<p>A disaster drill does not a crisis actor conspiracy make.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t prove anything. Look, I am with you on the fact that Boston doesn&#39;t add up. To be it looks like an FBI or CIA situation. Dude was probably &quot;radicalized&quot; by an agent over a period of time and talked into doing the attack.</p>

<p>Hiring actors to pretend they are hurt to make it believable isn&#39;t necessary when you can make it look super real by actually hurting/killing people</p>

<p>Hiring actors is too nice. Why would they give a fuck? They already killed thousands during 9/11. What&#39;s 3, 4 more?</p>
