I&#39;d just make a bunch of accounts now in anticipation of a future event. I mean switching between them is as simple as clicking twice if you have RES.</p>

<p>So if that&#39;s the case. Won&#39;t the 30 day rule only hurt people that wish to post something anonymously? Like a cop gone right, or a scared civilian?</p>

<p>Really all this does is force the real trolls step up their game and be harder to detect. I have another idea that&#39;s not as severe: make accounts that are &lt; 30 days old have a flair that says &quot;new account&quot; so people will know off the bat.</p>

<p>but this is just like, my opinion man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the whole of human generated content is just regurgitating propaganda. So in essence, we&#39;re all shills from whatever information we&#39;ve been given.</p>

<p>Theres some of us, though, that can draw conclusions from the information we&#39;ve been given and see who is motivated by propaganda and who is motivated by something else. Its our SHILL-EYE. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do I know? <strong>It becomes very clear.</strong> You know when the coincidences become too rare to be by chance alone.  When the conversation begins to continue through different people is another good example of how you know. Paying attention to usernames is pretty important too. </p>

<p>The path to knowing involves putting the time in to research a topic in a lot of detail.... Eventually, after you argue with the internet for long enough, you realize it has a common voice..... And when you begin to LISTEN to the arguments they have, and show that you understand the full complexity of the system and you can handle it responsibly... then their effect becomes much clearer... the voice of the internet is the voice of a constructed, fabricated battle between people who don&#39;t understand the knowledge of each other... too egotistical to ask... not the voice of unified knowledge.</p>

<p>That being said, you also have to be able to know when someone is motivated by belief in an illusion and not motivated by knowledge. Most of the posting on conspiracy lately, especially since there has been this directed effort against conspiracy nuts, has morphed into fear mongering... not research or evidence.... its a method that convolutes the argument such that no one garners anything but confusion from it.</p>

<p>They want to see someone use this message board irresponsibly, and that gives them the cause they need to shut it down. We have to remain diligent to the intellectual honesty that makes us conspiracy researchers. We have to be very careful to not cross the line into illegal activity, otherwise we are in their domain, and subject to their unfair rules. Because we didn&#39;t play by the rules.</p>

<p>Once you accept there is evil, and it is trying to fool you into believing in illusion on these postings.... it becomes a lot easier to parse through them and navigate with your SHILL-EYE.</p>

<p>&quot;Too rare to be by chance alone&quot; is a statistical statement. Are you saying that you have some formula for calculating the probability of certain events to distinguish them from random, or is this really just saying; &quot;Seems uncanny to me?&quot;</p>

<p>You said that there are shills being paid to post here. You&#39;ve made a claim - you&#39;re not supporting the claim you made, but instead attempting to attack the individual calling you out for your unsubstantiated claim.</p>

<p>Do some thinking:</p>

<p>Who supports the loudest most nonsense posters here(bumbling, tttt0t)? The mods that were removed. Who bans people that disagree with such posters? The mods that were removed. Who bans people at all? (hint: not donbueno)</p>

<p>For the 1 day that 9ksins and flytape were removed, everyone said this place is being run by &#39;the shills&#39;. Yet 9k and his crew are back, so who do the shills really support? Do the shills want crazy moderators that are going to ban people, or do the shills want a moderator that allows for discussion?</p>

<p>Think about it. Everyone is convinced that the PTB don&#39;t want you to know this stuff, yet you can post here and see it - clearly that isn&#39;t the case.</p>

<p>Is a shill someone who can have a discussion, or is a shill someone that stamps their feet like a baby insisting that their assertion is true, all without the use of rhetorical logic? I think it&#39;s the latter.</p>

<p>Yes, it will make it more difficult for those that utilize sock puppets.  That is the point.</p>

<p>You have just contradicted your own argument.</p>

<p>You say that it will make it more difficult for people to use alt accounts in the future, yet in your OP, you say that people will just make accounts ahead of time.</p>

<p>Scenario B: i&#39;m a giant troll/shill. I know i have to protect my future interests for my company/ i&#39;m a troll. So I make a few accounts now to anticipate the future trolling/shilling activities. </p>

<p>Also people can troll and will troll with day 0 accounts. But is it worth it, so that people with a valid reason to create a new account can&#39;t post?</p>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>That is it.  Not for &quot;new people in general&quot;, just for people who wish to use alt accounts immediately.  The majority of those people are trolls, and the majority of legitimate posters here would not be effected negatively.</p>
