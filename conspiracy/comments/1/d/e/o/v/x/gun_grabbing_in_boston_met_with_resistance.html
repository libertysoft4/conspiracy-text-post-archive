        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>BOSTON - National guard units seeking to confiscate a cache of recently banned assault weapons were ambushed on April 19th by elements of a para-military extremist faction. Military and law enforcement sources estimate that 72 were killed and more than 200 injured before government forces were compelled to withdraw.</p>

<p>Speaking after the clash Massachusetts Governor Thomas Gage declared that the extremist faction, which was made up of local citizens, has links to the radical right-wing tax protest movement. Gage blamed the extremists for recent incidents of vandalism directed against internal revenue offices. The governor, who described the group&#39;s organizers as &quot;criminals,&quot; issued an executive order authorizing the summary arrest of any individual who has interfered with the government&#39;s efforts to secure law and order. The military raid on the extremist arsenal followed wide-spread refusal by the local citizenry to turn over recently outlawed assault weapons.</p>

<p>Gage issued a ban on military-style assault weapons and ammunition earlier in the week. This decision followed a meeting in early this month between government and military leaders at which the governor authorized the forcible confiscation of illegal arms.</p>

<p>One government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, pointed out that &quot;none of these people would have been killed had the extremists obeyed the law and turned over their weapons voluntarily.&quot;</p>

<p>Government troops initially succeeded in confiscating a large supply of outlawed weapons and ammunition. However, troops attempting to seize arms and ammunition in Lexington met with resistance from heavily-armed extremists who had been tipped off regarding the government&#39;s plans. During a tense standoff in Lexington&#39;s town park, National Guard Colonel Francis Smith, commander of the government operation, ordered the armed group to surrender and return to their homes. The impasse was broken by a single shot, which was reportedly fired by one of the right-wing extremists. Eight civilians were killed in the ensuing exchange. Ironically, the local citizenry blamed government forces rather than the extremists for the civilian deaths. Before order could be restored, armed citizens from surrounding areas had descended upon the guard units.</p>

<p>Colonel Smith, finding his forces overmatched by the armed mob, ordered a retreat. Governor Gage has called upon citizens to support the state/national joint task force in its effort to restore law and order. The governor also demanded the surrender of those responsible for planning and leading the attack against the government troops. Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, and John Hancock, who have been identified as &quot;ringleaders&quot; of the extremist faction, remain at large.</p>

<p>&quot;Roughly three percent of the population fought for liberty at any given time during the American war for Independence. With a colonial population of 2,500,000 to 3,000,000 only about 250,000 men served during the war with never more than 90,000 men serving at any given time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Historians have estimated that approximately 40-45% of the colonists supported the rebellion while 15-20% of the population of the thirteen colonies remained loyal to the British Crown. The remaining 35-45% attempted to remain neutral.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Britain and its colonies had a war with france. Colonies secure and safe. Britain wants some tax money to pay the war debt it has accrued. Colonists say no. Revolution. I wouldn&#39;t have supported them. Good on the loyalists (I guess... the actual patriots?)</p>

<p>However, what became of the revolution, a government run by the people for the people, <em>was</em> good. And I would have supported that. But let&#39;s be real, the revolution was stirred up because the colonists wanted to have their cake - defense against the French - and eat it too - not pay their tax share and leave Britain with an enormous war debt to pay by itself. I doubt that at the beginning it had anything to do with high minded ideals of throwing off the divine right of the monarchy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s arguable that if the events of the 1700s were to happen now, our high speed communication would have allowed the colonists to have representation within parliament, and likely would not have led to revolt. Taxation without representation isn&#39;t the way things should be run. So I do have some support for the colonists there.</p>

<p>Regardless, the government isn&#39;t ran by or for the people anymore. So unless we can do something, the entire revolutionary episode would have been for naught.</p>

<p>That way of thinking is what has landed us where we are. The people don&#39;t <em>want</em> to fix problems. We have willingly given up our ability to do so by giving our government more power so they can do it for us. We have to get the people to take on more responsibility in order to stop the abuse of power by the few.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude it&#39;s called I do want to fix the problems, and to do this we created a government.</p>

<p>That government is currently NOT representing us, therefore they are creating problems and not fixing problems that they KNOW exist.</p>

<p>I want them to fix my problems via the democratic process, like legalizing marijuana which would fix a lot of problems.</p>

<p>Ending private prisons would fix a lot of problems.</p>

<p>Raising minimum wage would fix a lot of problems.</p>

<p>My point is that we are TRYING to get them to fix our problems, I call their fucking offices all the times ( my reps and others ) and all I get is a fucking answering machine or some fucking intern that&#39;s going to &quot;write down my message and give it to them so they can read it&quot; ( yeah right ).</p>

<p>My point is that they KNOW what problems exist, just as we do, yet they do nothing about it.</p>

<p>We the people call them, urge them, rally in the streets, yet they ignore us.</p>

<p>What more is there for us to do?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t talk for all but I personally do NOT want this to happen. The sad fact is this is where we are headed. Gun control, unfair taxation, the police state starting are just the beginning of what is to come in my eye. Logic is my reason, open your eyes and see what is happening to our country/world... It&#39;s in plain sight...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude it&#39;s called I do want to fix the problems, and to do this we created a government.</p>

<p>That government is currently NOT representing us, therefore they are creating problems and not fixing problems that they KNOW exist.</p>

<p>I want them to fix my problems via the democratic process, like legalizing marijuana which would fix a lot of problems.</p>

<p>Ending private prisons would fix a lot of problems.</p>

<p>Raising minimum wage would fix a lot of problems.</p>

<p>My point is that we are TRYING to get them to fix our problems, I call their fucking offices all the times ( my reps and others ) and all I get is a fucking answering machine or some fucking intern that&#39;s going to &quot;write down my message and give it to them so they can read it&quot; ( yeah right ).</p>

<p>My point is that they KNOW what problems exist, just as we do, yet they do nothing about it.</p>

<p>We the people call them, urge them, rally in the streets, yet they ignore us.</p>

<p>What more is there for us to do?</p>
