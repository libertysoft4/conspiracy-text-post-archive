Once its proven the real motive of the united states for invading the middle east (to protect the dollar and keep it the reserve currency) it would cause a severe crash on the economy. It might even destroy america. This would called uprising in the united states and what not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s basically common knowledge that at least &quot;something&quot; is fishy about 9/11. Everyone knows the USA goes to war for bogus reasons, the US is hated in half the world, but no one is able to do anything about it. Even if we had all the facts and the proof and the US government would admit to causing 9/11 themselves, nothing would change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s only common knowledge among the conspiracy circles, outside of it, they wont believe you because your considered a conspiracy theorist, and thanks to the mass media we are looked down upon so everything we say must not be true even if we have the evidence to back up what we say. If the US government admitted it, there would be serious problems.
1) Everything would be furious with the government for causing the deaths of so many people, which will result in riots. Then comes martial law. This would cause severe resistance from the people, because they know they cant trust the government anymore. Also people will be furious with the government because they funded an unjust war which caused the US to go severly in debt for nothing. 
2) The reason why they need 9/11 was to attack the middle east. They needed the public approval. Some people to this day still believe the government is protecting them from terrorists, and are helping innocent people figting oppresive governments, when in reality the real reason why the US are in the middle east are: Gold Backed Currency which will threaten the US dollar Country? Libya, and not to mention the other countries who have started to trade oil in other currency than US dollar (who were attacked by the US). If US loses it status as the reserve currency, shit will hit hit and that is exactly what will happen if US government admits to 9/11.

    <div class="md"><p>...although seemingly among the newer crop of theories, the simulation theory is actually one of the oldest (if not the oldest). Here is the ancient Indian variation:</p>

<p>This world is called in Sanskrit <strong>Maya</strong>, meanining &quot;that which is not&quot; and, according to vedic philosophy, it is a simulated version of the absolute world (literally made of consciousness), a.k.a. <strong>Brahman</strong> or <strong>Vaikuntha</strong>. </p>

<p>The substance by which this world is fashioned is supposed to be consciousness temporarily rendered unconscious (&quot;matter&quot;) and into this seemingly inert matter (energized and made to move by the conscious will of some kind of higher will, maintaining its laws—which includes the law of karma), conscious souls willing to experiment this type of world are inserted and their connection with the absolute world temporarily cut. With time (millions and trillions of years) they forget their original state and get lost in the cycle of reincarnation. </p>

<p>The vedics called the deliberate process of gradual remembrance or &quot;waking up&quot; <strong>yoga</strong> , which literally means &quot;to link again&quot;—much like its Latin counterpart &quot;re&quot; (again)+&quot;ligare&quot;(link) from which the word &quot;religion&quot; comes from. These yogic processes are of many types but essentially they have the same purpose -- Enlightenment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe if you ask some specific questions I could be more informing. The knowledge base is vast and I&#39;ve been studying this stuff for seven years now :). </p>

<p>What I find most fascinating about this vedic the world-is-a-simulation theory is the degree of detail found in the philosophy behind it. I mean, even if it&#39;s all an invention, it&#39;s one hell of a creative and detailed invention. Just to give you some glimpses, according to these theories:</p>

<p>-there are three stages in the manifestation of the material world of <em>maya</em>; the first one is called <em>pradhana</em>, in which matter (temporarily inert conscious substance--and by temporarily this could mean billions of years), is devoid of any differentiation...it&#39;s the &quot;stuff&quot; that will be molded into the world; the second one is called <em>mahatattva</em>, where matter is differentiated according to some principles of design, getting the world ready for the entrance of the souls; and the third stage is called <em>prakrti</em>, where the souls are kind of injected into the world via what is called the <em>shambhu</em> principle (a.k.a. Shiva). It is this stage that is depicted in the Shiva-Parvati worship of the tantric schools.</p>

<p>-as far as scales of size and time, the theory says that there are inumerable universes (the actual word for universe is <em>brahmanda</em> which can be roughly translated as &quot;brahman-like&quot;, meaning that it is based on the original world, <em>Brahman</em> -- or, if you want – a simulation :) ). Apparently, one universe lasts for roughly 300 trillion Earth years, after which they are destroyed; by destroyed it means a reversal of the creation, not actual destruction; the <em>prakriti</em> is emptied of conscious entities (called <em>atma</em>), then the <em>mahatattva</em> principles of order are taken back and the universe reverts to the state of <em>pradhana</em>, inert, non-energized, formless matter; then everything starts again; one important note – in “charge” of every universe there’s an entity (not Supreme) called Prajapati Brahma whose mind is as big as the universe; and tiny quantas of this mind are given to individual souls as an interface of interaction with the rest of matter; </p>

<p>Any questions :) ?</p>

<p>These are two fascinating resources for &quot;Vedic simulationists&quot; :)

<p>Could I add also Gnosticism within the vision that reality is an <em>illusion</em> (reflection), hence imperfect (suffering) created by the Demiurge/God/Satan (architect), to keep us entrapt in a never ending cycle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting angle. </p>

<p>It sort of follows the same line, but with the twist of sometimes making the Demiurge a malevolent entity. This is not the case in the Vedic view, where this entity Brahma Prajapati is not at all evil, on the contrary. He&#39;s more an Engineer of the Universe than an Architect since the plans for the universal structure and laws are actually received by him from the Supreme Entity, God, if you want, from outside the material world. He is more like the Implementer, the one actually doing it and he takes pleasure in this. There is even a famous hymn <a href="http://vedabase.net/bs/">Brahma Samhita</a>, of which only the 5th chapter of -- I think -- one hundred was found intact, where Brahma is shown offering prayers and glorifying the spiritual world and the Absolute, named Govinda or Krsna. What is interesting is that Brahma himself cannot leave the universe until his life expires, at the dissolution. He is described mostly spending his time in meditation on the Absolute, realising his “mistake” and preparing to leave. That’s why he is like a Demiurge. He has underlings taking care of the universe in the mean time :).</p>

<p>In terms of malevolent entities, like Satan, there are multiple types in the Vedas, but the main force that is keeping the sould &quot;trapped&quot; in the illusion is the soul&#39;s own free will to enjoy separately from the Absolute, simply put—selfishness. That’s the real Satan. If an entity truly wants to get out of this world there is absolutely nothing that can stop it. In the <em>yoga</em> literature it is said that once the <em>yogi</em> has decided for Enlightenment, the Absolute ensures his safe passage. The degree of advancement is directly proportionate to the sincerity of the will to go back. </p>

<p>Conversely, the degree of selfishness also proportionately reflects in the degree of illusion and, consequently, suffering, the souls brings upon itself. The facilitator of this illusion is the <em>Maya</em> energy of God, sometimes known as Durga (literally meaning &quot;prison&quot;). This energy is so powerful it even influences the Demiurge who is also under some degree of illusion otherwise he would not be in this world. But you can&#39;t really call this energy malevolent, since it is just responding to the original will of the living entity. She&#39;s providing the deluding power of the virtual reality suit, if you want.</p>

<p>Of course, in the Vedas, there are also good old fashion demons (called <em>asuras</em>, <em>danava</em> or <em>rakshasha</em> or <em>nagas</em> or other names) but their influence is somewhat minimal in the universal scheme of things, with occasional swings in their favor. Presumably, they get their energy through powerful, gruesome austerities, taking advantage of the universal laws by which austerity of the senses equates in more power to control matter (a.k.a. the Power of the Dark Side :) -- interesting how in Star Wars when the Emperor uses his power when killing Samuel L. Jackson, his body changes as a result; perhaps Lucas was inspired by Oriental philosophy here :) ). Once demons get that power they sometimes use it to do battle with the cosmic administrators who are helping Brahma Prajapati take care of the universe. The European equivalent of these demons would be the Greek Titans and Brahma&#39;s helpers, called <em>devas</em> in the Vedas, would be the Greek Gods. The <em>devas</em> have a king called Indra, which is more the name of a post than his actual name. Cosmically there is always a struggle between the <em>asuras</em> and the <em>devas</em>, but they never actually win in the end because the <em>devas</em> ultimately are helped by an <em>avatar</em> coming from the Absolute world. It is actually mentioned that the demons can sometimes overpower the <em>devas</em> due to the intensity of their ambition, which sometimes is greater than the intensity of the <em>devas</em>’ ambition, since they are more saintly in mentality. But, since their saintliness attracts the Absolute, there’s no loss in that :))</p>

<p>Now I know this response has gone for way too long, but I just want to add another piece of interesting information relating to these demons. In the Vedic tradition there is indeed a dark side of spirituality which is a branch of the Tantra Yoga school, called <em>Vama Marga</em> or The Way of the Left Hand, since the important part of the rituals are made with the left hand, the “dirty hand”, in the Vedic culture (as an aside it is interesting how the English word “sinister” comes from the Latin-Italian route, where sinistra means “left”). Without going into details, in this school for black magicians, trying to use the universal laws to gain power and control over the material energy, the practicioners make use of demonic entities called <em>chatan</em>, with which sinister deals are made. </p>

<p>And last, but not least, there the “local” demon called Kali Purusha (not to be confused with Goddess Kali-Durga) who is supposedly in charge of the Kali Yuga, the current epoch a.k.a. The Age of Quarrel, where souls with Kali’s demonic mental archetype are born (greedy, lusty, rapacious etc). I think Kali’s description best resembles what we in the West would call Satan.</p>

<p>basically, we dont yet vote, FPTP is a mathematical illusion , actual voting allows the voter to vote for exactly what they want instead of our current system that only allows a strategic bet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the Holocaust. If the Holocaust suddenly turned out to be a scam, German population and politics would make a swift and brutal turn to the far right, and being the strongest political and economical force in Europe would cause tensions all over. A nationalistic government would drop out of the European Union and it would break apart, causing trouble in half of the former EU states, leading to riots and uproars. The poverty and despair could lead to far right politicians gaining power in those countries as well. Suddenly we would have a situation similar to that 100 years ago, and it didn&#39;t turn out too great for the world back then.</p>

<p>Honestly religion had and has a true value in establishing our society, from the inception of human civilization, as a moral compass, solace, reason for preserverance, philosophical enquirements, scientific advancements and further understanding of our existance.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as a powerful force which it stands for, religion has been constantly been hijacked for the selfish needs of the elites to manipulate the masses, as always most are looking torwards something or someone for the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know, having made a lot of personal first-hand experience with a wide array of drugs and drug users, I think if the government really wanted to keep the peoples&#39; consciousness down, they&#39;d supply them with more drugs, especially weed. Yeah it makes people philosophical and &quot;more open minded&quot;, but it also numbs down all personal needs. As a long-term user you just lose your ability to give a shit.</p>

SO a logical way to stop their &quot;terrifying behavior&quot; would be to cut off their main profit and legalize here.  We would end the drug war, reduce hard drug use create stony jobs for &quot;stoners&quot; and 
the people that fell into addiction would be less than the difference lost by alcohol consumers..... NOT TO MENTION TOBACCO and the absurd amount of money &quot;lazy stoners&quot; can contribute to education.  WE could pay teachers what they DESERVE.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would have to be something current and relevant. Conspiracies about JFK or the Defenestration of Prague won&#39;t cause any outrage.</p>

<p><em>Aliens</em></p>

<p>If a government was hiding evidence of (intelligent) alien life forms, that wouldn&#39;t shake much up. It would surprise and enlighten people, but they&#39;d go on with their lives just the same. The water cooler talk would be cooler. It wouldn&#39;t confirm UFOs. It would confirm what reasonable people assume about a universe of near-infinite size and complexity.</p>

<p>If extraterrestrials made contact, it would depend on the contact. Many would be in disbelief until they saw the little green men petting their dog and prepping it for an anal probe.</p>

<p><em>9/11</em></p>

<p>If 9/11 were proven to be a false flag, the USA would go through decades of pain. It could produce rife civil war, recriminations, and factionalism, akin to Germany from 1918-1945 or any decades-long conflict. This would bring an early decline to the American empire and the rise of Canada, Mexico, Europe, Russia, China, India, Africa, etc. Many Americans would be murdered and assassinated over this. The active-duty military would probably want to a orchestrate a coup of some form, since they paid the costs. It would be bad, bad, bad and not just for the USA. The global economy would collapse for 10-20 years.</p>

<p><em>Illuminati, Bilderburg, vampires, etc</em></p>

<p>If anyone is secretly controlling the world and all the major political events, presumably they could control the reaction to this as well. There is no such group controlling the show, so I won&#39;t entertain this one at length.</p>
