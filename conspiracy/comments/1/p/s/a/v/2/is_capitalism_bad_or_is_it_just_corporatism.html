        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I keep seeing posts on here about how bad capitalism is on here. About how greedy capitalism causes all the </p>

<p>problems in the world. But most of the examples you give when talking about how bad capitalism is are examples of </p>

<p>government spending, that is, big business getting unfair government handouts. Or some big politician or CEO or</p>

<p>banker profiting unfairly at the expense of others. The only problem is that these are not cases of capitalism.</p>

<p>Capitalism is free enterprise, voluntary exchange, economic freedom. Government spending is the opposite of that; it </p>

<p>is corporatism or socialism. If capitalism really was what big business or big banking wanted, they would all be </p>

<p>backing the Libertarian Party rather than the Republican (and occasionally Democratic) Party. What big business </p>

<p>wants is a government that will make laws that appear to be in the general welfare of the people but in reality shield </p>

<p>them from competition from smaller businesses. This is corporatism. In a capitalist society, big business and banks </p>

<p>would be subject to competition and therefore be better companies. I think if more people on here knew about </p>

<p>minarchism, or libertarianism, or anarcho-capitalism, they wouldn&#39;t have such an attitude towards the capitalist </p>

<p>ideology. You-all should read some Ludwig von Mises, or Murray N. Rothbard, or Hans F. Senholz, or F. A. Hayek, or </p>

<p>Henry Hazlitt, or Llewellyn Rockwell, or something. If any of you disagree with me, I am open to debate (granted I </p>

<p>may not get back to you until tomorrow, as it is almost time to sleep)</p>

<p>TL;DR: Capitalism isn&#39;t bad; corporatism is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it just boils down to a total lack of understanding the definitions of a few words. It&#39;s quite sad, really. I think everyone agrees that it is &quot;bad&quot; for a couple hundred people to accumulate most of the wealth. Of course this is possible in a purely capitalistic society, but only an unfair one. In general, if a person is 100 times more productive than the average person, they should have 100 times the wealth, but we have a gangster-style control over all major areas of our society. Bash gangster behavior, not capitalism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We shouldn&#39;t worry about rich people having too much, unless we are broke as shit for no reason of our own. It&#39;s easy to demonize the wealthy, while forgetting that there will always be people at the top. Some people think this life is all about amassing as much wealth as possible. I think it&#39;s a waste of time. When people ask me what I do for living, I tell them I live for a living. I don&#39;t want to be defined by my career. It&#39;s fine if other people do, but I don&#39;t. </p>

<p>In reality we all want as much freedom as possible. The means to the end is our biggest disagreement. Some people are concerned about environmental issues, so they lobby to restrict businesses from polluting. Some people want to feed the poor, so they lobby for food stamps. Some people think psychedelic drugs are harmful so they vote politicians who are anti-drugs. Others think healthcare is right, so they lobby for nationalized healthcare. </p>

<p>The problem is that politicians aren&#39;t very good at problem solving. They are however efficient at producing legislature capable of making it to the president&#39;s desk. And the bills keep adding up. Regulation only increases over time, and often times in areas that aren&#39;t effective, are completely unnecessary, and do massive amounts of damage to the long term sustainability of our nation. </p>

<p>My only wish is that everyone used great care when advocating taxation and regulation with the threat of violence. Policies like the drug war are terrifying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the problem of money hoarding has to be addressed eventually. I hope you&#39;re aware of the current situation with only a few people owning literally almost all money. I guess we could just periodically allow them to take all of it (which always will happen) and just start new currencies that they eventually will also accumulate almost all of. That&#39;s just reality. After a certain point, they can buy countries and private armies to enslave everyone. That&#39;s not a good thing from any perspective. So capitalism is good, but the extreme end needs to be addressed because its no longer capitalism when you&#39;re a slave.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to point a distinction though.</p>

<p>Capitalism is a system of capital, which basically means savings. The more savings there is, the more the value of the money increases and thus creating growth and prosperity.</p>

<p>That&#39;s basically it. When talking about consumption and sales and goods and services its human interaction, this interaction builds a marketplace which is us the humans, each and every one of us, when that market has no 3rd party influence its free and thus called free market.</p>

<p>The system that we have now is a system of fraud and anti-capitalism, as its based in consumption and money printing, which is the opposite of capitalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose we will just have to run an experiment then. Given a fully free market without regulations, will a tiny percentage of people accumulate all wealth? If all wealth (or 99 percent of it) is hoarded, is this good? Also, given a fully free market, what is stopping psychopaths from buying armies to enslave everyone? Is it still capitalism when the entire country is a prison and your sole life objective is to pay debt? </p>

<p>This is why I believe in multiple currencies and countries being limited in size. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This experiment has already been done.  By us in the early years.   Why do you think the idea of moving to America was so popular all over the world?  You could go to America and make something of yourself?   It is only as we have added more and more laws and basically destroyed the checks and balances in the Constitution, and gave Corporations the status of being &quot;people&quot; themselves that we have had rampant corruption.</p>

<p>Bashing free market, and capitalism is pure and simple a scape goat.   We have had neither of these things for some time.</p>

<p>If our experiment is not good enough.   I recommend this.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.libertarianism.org/publications/essays/how-laissez-faire-made-sweden-rich">http://www.libertarianism.org/publications/essays/how-laissez-faire-made-sweden-rich</a></p>

<p>Sweden did the experiment too and it saved their country.   They have only within the last half century (or less) begun implementing more and more socialism.   They are seeing some negative effects but are still riding pretty high on the wealth and prosperity they accumulated.</p>

<p>Read the article.   It was an eye opener for me.   I knew absolutely nothing about Sweden&#39;s history until I read that a few days ago.</p>

<p>So the experiment has already been done.  It has generally been successful until corruption starts to change it.   This is true of EVERY ideology including socialism, communism, etc.    When we were more free market we had people running to America from Socialist countries.</p>

<p>Now we are more Corporatism, than Capitalism or anything else.   There has never been historically something quite like we are now.   Though the disease has spread for about 100 years all over the world.</p>

<p>Fiat money is no stable foundation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think a small percentage would accumulate all wealth? Also it specifically won&#39;t be hoarded, since savings would increase in value, so you&#39;d be wasting opportunity to invest and buy stuff on the cheap. </p>

<p>In fact its reasonable to say that it would lead to the most equality, as you would be free to open a lemonade stand and not have anyone stand in your way. </p>

<p>Free to set up hot dog stand right next to the big restaurant that right now is protected by government. </p>

<p>Plus the sheer fact that you won&#39;t be paying 50% of your income to the government would mean more production, and resources being allocated where its most needed, not where governments decide. </p>

<p>Right now patents, IP, copyright, etc... is creating so much oligopolies in the drug, technology, biological spheres of business.  Just the abolishment of those would create so much competition and that would lead to cheaper prices and more abundance of products, allowing more people to have these products.</p>

<p>How you can protect something like a book you wrote for example would be through fraud, no one can use the work you did as their own, they can&#39;t sell your book as their own.</p>

<p>I also think the culture would slowly shift from wanting to do bad to the other guy, to cooperation and wanting everyone to do good, because people realize they benefit from it directly or indirectly. </p>

<p>I guess you don&#39;t remember the days of the industrial and financial tycoons and how unregulated they were.  </p>

<p>As history tells us, people will form gangs, collude and price fix for maximum profits instead of compete, monopolize and build private armies.  There will be no utopia, only dystopia.  </p>

<p>There will be droves of illiterate, diseased people since school and immunization won&#39;t be a requirement nor affordable to many.  </p>

<p>There will be tycoon land owners and their peasant workers living in shanty towns without any hope of upward mobility.  </p>

<p>This is what brought on the formation of labor unions, and work place regulations.  </p>

<p>To undo all of this would be to undo the achievements that came from the horrible struggles of laborers of the last two centuries.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL. Its not going to be utopia, no one claims such a thing, its won&#39;t be perfect, but it will be the best for the most amount of people. </p>

<p>Freedom works, every country/region that has had some level of freedom has advanced and build, every country that has had minimum to no freedom has regressed.</p>

<p>As far as price fixing, that exist today as well with all the regulations in place, don&#39;t pretend how its perfect today and how everyone is so wealthy, I guess you don&#39;t know even basics of economy and haven&#39;t heard of alternative.</p>

<p>For example due to massive wheat shortages in East Europe in the 18th century, today&#39;s Hungary and Romania the people started eating corn bread. </p>

<p>In other cases in history they would all together remove bread from their diet and consume more meat as an alternative. </p>

<p>As far as people having armies that is just absurd thinking, it costs way too much. The few mercenary groups of today can only exist with having 20k soldiers because of government, the average mercenary gets paid 125.000 US dollars per 8 hour work shift. </p>

<p>You can not have an army in a free market, it just cost too much and you get too little out of it. It would literally cost much less to build the best factory, start making products and sell them at profit. </p>

<p>Finally you are looking at the 18th century when we had no technology, very little understanding still, even rich people didn&#39;t have education because there were so few teachers, because knowledge was rare. </p>

<p>With todays technology and knowledge you can easily educate millions more, in fact I believe that we would probably have over 99.5% educated if we didn&#39;t have government still keeping the education in a box to where its been for over 200 years.</p>

<p>I mean we have the internet now, you can watch a lesson on any mobile phone, on a projector, the classes can be more interactive and practical, rather than all theoretical. </p>

<p>If we didn&#39;t have all the government regulations for schools, state and private schools and we didn&#39;t have government still keeping the status quo of education we would have much better education and one that isn&#39;t propaganda to support government so that the big corporations you so fear can take your money and give it to themselves in bailouts and government contracts in the billions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I am extremely rich and paranoid, what is stopping me from hiring security? After I accumulate so much wealth and have property spanning multiple countries, that security force will turn into a police force. Also, what is stopping me from bribing other people so that I could accumulate money even faster? I imagine that given enough time, eventually all monetary units will end up in the hands of a few people, just like a game of monopoly. I agree that we don&#39;t really have capitalism, but what if we did? Why wouldn&#39;t rich people create a system with rules, effectively nullifying the capitalism in the first place?

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing. In fact one can expect really rich people to get security to protect themselves and their property from poorer people who would try and steal from them or do them harm.</p>

<p>This is also good business for the company providing the security.</p>

<p>AS far as the security business turning into police that won&#39;t be the case because they want multiple customers, rather than just one customer.</p>

<p>Thing is hiring security is expensive, if someone is to have say 10 security people 24/7/365 days a year, he would be spending millions of dollars. </p>

<p>If you are imagining someone from hiring an army I assure you it won&#39;t happen. It just cost too damn much for too little. It would literally cost way less to produce a product and sell it and make good profits that way, than take it at gun point, and if we assume most will pack heavy weapons and be community oriented, I just don&#39;t see how one would get any befits from trying to take stuff by force.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Many people use it to describe the system of state support of wealthy industrialists.&quot; - This is the problem.   This is not capitalism.  In true capitalism the states duties would only be to insure your individual rights and property rights are not infringed upon.   The state giving favoritism to wealthy industrialists goes by the name &quot;Crony Capitalism&quot; at times.   Though we go beyond that.   Corporations are given the rights of people and they persist longer than a human life, and have only ONE goal.   That goal is to increase the profit of their share holders.   Since they are not an individual any moral or ethical quandaries and individual MAY experience can be for the most part ignored.   This is where a big part of the corruption for our system came from.    There has already been an extensive study that showed that in a psychological test to see if a person is a psychopath is applied to many corporations (especially the really big ones) they actually would be deemed Psychopathic.    Now keep in mind they are granted the rights as though they are a person.   This means some of the most powerful &quot;people&quot; in our government are actually psychopathic and can have a lifespan greatly beyond that of an actual person.</p>

<p>KEEP IN MIND: The entity called a Corporation does not need to exist in Capitalism.  The acts of such an entity though are often misunderstood and blamed on capitalism or free market.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism has plenty of positives but do not ignore its inherent deficiencies.  The main issue with capitalism is its a system which encourages accumulation of wealth which can lead to an inequities in influence and power.  Large corporations benefit from government protections in our current system but let&#39;s not pretend that monopolies and scarcity cannot exist in a &quot;true free market.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  </p>

<p>The lack of regulation will mean that business are free to collude, price fix, do insider trading, manipulate stock prices,  not provide safe working conditions, hire children for menial labor, pollute the environment with impunity, etc, etc.  </p>

<p>I guess no one remembers the history of Tycoons and their peasant workers living in squalor.  </p>

<p>No one remembers why financial, environmental, and labor regulations came to exist.  </p>

<p>It was because the only freedom that existed was for the very rich and we&#39;re headed back there again with continued deregulation of big businesses.  </p>

<p>Libertarianism will result in feudalism all over again.  So if you&#39;re not a land owner, expect nothing more than being a peasant working class slave.  (Libertarians will say &quot;but it&#39;s not slavery if they volunteer.&quot;)  </p>

<p>Somehow leaving people with no choice but to die or work for pennies is not forcing them.  </p>

<p>They say that violently shutting down unions is supposedly also not using force because it&#39;s in your self defense of maintaining your profits.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the naive assumption that currently existing big businesses will become less powerful and move aside for local small businesses.  </p>

<p>Since everything will be privatized and for-profit, most people will be illiterate due to unaffordable private schools, have diseases due to no requirement or affordability of vaccines, not be able to afford health care, be unhygienic due to for-profit water utilities, unable afford electricity, shit in the street due to for-profit waste disposal and for-profit sewer systems, etc.  </p>

<p>Seems like what Libertarians did was skim through what the Austrian School entails and read the ridiculous fictional works of the obviously sociopathic Ayn Rand.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, the premise of socialism and communism is that the state should have monopolies on industry, so either of these would not help with curing the disease of monopolies. And we also have monopolies today, such as the corporation&#39;s unfair benefit, as you mentioned, or ones such as the government&#39;s monopoly on money.</p>

<p>But I will argue that monopolies can only exist with government. In order for something to be a monopoly, it must be able to cut its production, and/or cut quality of things produced, and raise prices.</p>

<p>In a governed society, this can exist, as such a monopoly could get &quot;corporate welfare&quot; from the government, and continue to hold a monopoly.</p>

<p>In a &quot;true free market&quot;, if a monopoly were to lower its production or quality, and raise prices, then there would be more demand for a cheaper or better quality product. A venture capitalist would then satisfy that demand by starting his own company in the same industry as the monopoly. Yes, his company might be 1/10th the size of the monopoly, but his company would grow as long as the monopoly continued its monopolistic behavior. It would come to a point where the monopoly would either have to lower its prices, and improve production and/or quality, or it would be replaced by the venture capitalist&#39;s company. Usually it is the former, but this is what keeps big companies in check. A monopoly cannot permanently sustain itself without the use of force, i.e. government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Scarcity, whether actual or artificial (due to various manipulations of contracts), is a very easy way for a monopoly to exist in an entirely free market.  If what you produce cannot be produced by anyone else, you have a monopoly.  This can be especially dangerous when the scarcity is of food or water or other resources that are necessary to survive.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also possible for a monopoly to exist via competitive history.  Let&#39;s say you start a grocery store and you have mega capital behind it - you may charge whatever you want and effectively run any competition out of business.  Once you&#39;re all alone, you can then raise all your prices.  It is entirely conceivable that nobody will risk creating a start up to compete with you with the understanding that you can just drop all your prices again and drive them out of business.  This is quite an extreme but not outside of the realm of possibilities which is my point - monopolies are most definitely POSSIBLE.</p>

<p>Now to be clear, I am not advocating communism - but I think it&#39;s important to have the understanding that free market capitalism has all sorts of potential pitfalls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my definition of capitalism as a business owner&#39;s perspective:</p>

<p>I make something that brings me in money. I try sell my product for as much as I can, but eventually the lazy &quot;geniuses/leeches&quot; of capitalism cut into my market.</p>

<p>To compete I have to either innovate (which my competition will just copy me again or cut prices), in turn I can cut my prices &amp; lower workers wages or reframe my product to charge more.</p>

<p>Now since most of capitalism is just that.... copy &amp; cut circle jerk between competitors... we are always in a race to zero. Why?</p>

<p>Because when humanity isn&#39;t capable of enforcing copyright or negotiating global slave labor ages (free) out of existence it doesn&#39;t look too good for the workers/consumer class of people.</p>

<p>If I can hire people in another country that will do the labor for almost free &amp; no benefits, how are regular joes going to offer me a better deal? Workers who need pay rent, eat &amp; have a life cannot compete with slave labor wages.</p>

<p>Not only that, but who do you think the game of business wins the most...
the honest and forthright or the aggressive and duplicitous?</p>

<p>The aggressive and corrupt will win most of the time
and they will lie, cheat &amp; steal to protect their lifestyle.</p>

<p>Honest business owners are prevented from entering capitalist markets all of
the time because of absurd governmental &quot;requirements&quot;.</p>

<p>Workers are totally screwed in this type situation.</p>

<p>Free market capitalism as a saviour to workers is a nasty piece of not very well thought out science fiction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This example is based on the idea that people can and will be self-sufficient. People cannot themselves produce everything they need to survive. If they tried, they would starve after a short time, and that short time would be pretty crappy. To solve this, people exchange goods. They barter. But people only voluntarily sell things if the product they are buying is worth more to them than the product they are selling. And why should it be otherwise? If Alphonso was able to build a house, and Smith had grown corn and wheat, and they both valued some of their neighbor&#39;s goods or services rather than their own, why wouldn&#39;t they sell their goods and services to each other? So this argument doesn&#39;t hold because what about the things Joe can&#39;t make himself. In order to have a communist society you described, you would have to have people sell and buy things at amounts equal in value to each other. But who would decide how much of something is equal to how much of something else, a communist economic planner? Why wouldn&#39;t the planner be corrupt? Maybe perfect communism could work in an ideal society, but any ideology could work in a society ideal for said ideology. The only problem is society is not ideal. And a commodity&#39;s value is subjective to each person. It&#39;s value to each person is based on how much demand and/or importance someone places on said commodity. So the only way for both people to be well off would be for them to voluntarily trade (capitalism). Voluntary trade only happens when each trader values each other&#39;s product more than their own.</p>

<p>Socialism/communism cannot sustain itself. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Given a list of goods to produce, whether those desired by the members of society in their roles as consumers or those on an agenda concocted by a dictator, any developed economy must have a way to decide how to employ its resources in the best possible way to produce the desired goods. Under capitalism, this challenge receives a response fully adequate to the difficulty it poses. Resources, whether land, labor, or capital, exist subject to ownership by individuals. These persons will trade in markets. Doing so will enable them to price production goods according to their most efficient use in securing the desired consumption goals. No one assumes that the free market cannot do this calculation, but in reality, only the free market can. Socialism by definition consists of the centralized direction of the economy, its main means of production being under “public,” i.e. government, ownership. How can a centralized system, in the absence of markets, decide whether a use of resources to produce a good is more efficient than a rival use? Any “prices” the director of the economy imposes will be arbitrary and of no value for genuine calculation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>-Excerpt from &quot;Mises Contra Marx&quot; by David Gordon</p>

<p>And about resources being finite, one thing about capitalism is that it needs resources to keep running. Society needs resources to keep running. Because of this, there is a market demand for resources. Because there is a demand, there will be profitability in satisfying that demand, and because of that, there will be a trader to produce resources and fill that demand. And if you don&#39;t like a company&#39;s use of resources, or anything else about a company, than boycott that company. Get others to boycott it to.</p>

<p>And about workers being poor in capitalism. One major part off capitalism is that it is voluntary exchange. A worker will exchange his or her labor for money. The difference between this system and other economic systems is that workers work voluntarily. If they feel they are underpaid for their labor, they can voluntarily stop working for said company. They can form unions and strike. A company cannot survive without its workers. </p>

<p><strong>Capitalism isn&#39;t perfect, and neither is communism, or socialism, for that matter. Society isn&#39;t ideal and we don&#39;t have utopia. The only difference, however, is that capitalism is the closest we can get.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to point a distinction though.</p>

<p>Capitalism is a system of capital, which basically means savings. The more savings there is, the more the value of the money increases and thus creating growth and prosperity.</p>

<p>That&#39;s basically it. When talking about consumption and sales and goods and services its human interaction, this interaction builds a marketplace which is us the humans, each and every one of us, when that market has no 3rd party influence its free and thus called free market.</p>

<p>The system that we have now is a system of fraud and anti-capitalism, as its based in consumption and money printing, which is the opposite of capitalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many different kinds and forms of capitalism, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages.  Any of them that allow for a plutarchy to develop, or that focuses on extreme competition and greed, or that lets the free market dictate prices on humanitarian &quot;goods&quot; (ex healthcare) is doomed for failure and misery. </p>

<p>The best we have seen so far seems to be the Norther European example (Norway/Sweden/Finland/Iceland/Denmark/Germany) and although these systems are far from perfect they are the closest real world example of non-destructive capitalism to be found.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is Corporatism.   Capitalism itself is not bad.   MOST ideologies implemented by societies have been done with great ideas at heart.   They just all do not work long term with human nature.   This includes Socialism, Communism, Capitalism, etc.   They have flaws.   However, capitalism is the only one that has consistently revived nations.   It is only over time as corruption seeps in that problems arise.   When an ideology is newly implemented the generation that implemented it knows the horrors of what came before.   They typically approach it with integrity.   Over successive generations this knowledge of the past is simply stories rather than personal experience.   Eventually people will learn to manipulate ANY system.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have the answer for utopia.   I can tell you that all of the people bashing capitalism don&#39;t really know what capitalism is.   It is certainly not Corporations that have the rights of people, yet are proven to have psychopathic tendencies (see documentary The Corporation).</p>

<p>Socialism is full of problems as well.   So many people that want socialism in our country choose to ignore the words of people that fled Socialist countries to come to ours.   These were generations past.</p>

<p>People hold up Sweden as Socialist.   It was not the socialism that they now have that revived them.   It was unfettered free market capitalism.   They&#39;ve only recently been implementing socialism and are living high at the moment off of the wealth and prosperity the free market brought them.   Some of you may want a source.   I myself did not know much about Sweden&#39;s history until a few days ago... have a look at this.  <a href="http://www.libertarianism.org/publications/essays/how-laissez-faire-made-sweden-rich">http://www.libertarianism.org/publications/essays/how-laissez-faire-made-sweden-rich</a>   - It is very long, very well written, and very informative.</p>

<p>The positives of capitalism is that it accepts that humans demand free enterprise and the ability to create freely. However, it demands that these enterprises and creations be done exclusively for the purposes of making money, not sustaining life. </p>

(<a href="http://weirdonlinenews.com/?p=296">http://weirdonlinenews.com/?p=296</a> there&#39;s the link, it&#39;s a good read). Because it&#39;s so far-fetched, organisation such as the ADA can get away with disregarding incredible amounts of evidence. They do this, because root canal procedures are the most profitable procedures in Dentistry.
If you&#39;ve ever looked into hemp oil, you&#39;ll read stories about how it has cured people of cancer within a matter of weeks, and these are terminally ill patients. Of course, you&#39;d have to travel elsewhere to get hemp oil, as hemp, and other marijuana based products are illegal in most of the Western World. Because it&#39;s bad for you? No, because what kind of pharmaceutical company would want  to lose out on the money they make through Chemotherapy, and all the pills and bonus drugs that come with it? Not to mention the quality of paper and clothes hemp can make.</p>

<p>THIS, is capitalism. It does not care for the people, it does not have economical stability in mind, it only cares for profit. Profit for the rich and powerful, even if that means pain, suffering, and death for everyone below. </p>

<p>Capitalism also promotes a society of competition, which goes against human nature (sorry I&#39;m not sure of the source, but I&#39;m pretty sure they talked about this study in the Zeitgeist movie). We are naturally good, and seek to help others, but this society forces us to become competitive, and seek to be in front, so it makes us mentally unhealthy too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason I don&#39;t like capitalism is its based off of the excess of goods, which easily entertains greed. The economy in America would fall apart if everyone only had what they need, so many jobs are based on the average citizen having more than what they need. </p>

<p>Through the competition capitalism allows, it forces cheap products (a lot of which aren&#39;t even made locally) which means workers are paid the absolute least a company can get away with.  </p>

<p>This is why I prefer a peer to peer based economy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The system we have is corporatism. But the problem is, corporatism seems to be the inevitable conclusion or byproduct of a pure capitalist system. </p>

<p>Some reforms may prevent capitalism from becoming corporatism: election campaign reforms, for one. I&#39;d also be for environmental legislation (not cap-and-trade, ugh... let&#39;s not set up a bogus financial market on CO2, by which banks will loot any and all business), and corporate lobbying restrictions.  This&#39;ll make any capitalist shudder, but I also like protectionist measures and labor reforms.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m saying that it&#39;s much more of a spectrum with regards to govt involvement on businesses. As of right now (as you pointed out), our govt&#39;s been hijacked by the companies, and have rendered the people with little power. Thus, our govt has been an enabler of terrible corporate behavior. If govts could be extricated from the corporate grip, I&#39;d feel much better about the govt making much-needed reforms. </p>

<p>The fact is, though, companies do need to be put in check by govts: they need to stop outsourcing labor to countries with abhorrent conditions for pennies an hour; they need to stop dumping waste in the soils and streams; they need to issue reasonable wages to workers so they can afford to buy the products they help assemble... globalism has caused a society where entire countries become losers in the economic game of capitalism. For a while, Americans were winners. Now we&#39;re waking up to the reality that we&#39;re about to become the losers (save for the .01 percent) real fast. </p>

<p>I wish the citizenry could enable these reforms--after all, if everyone stopped shopping at WalMart until they stopped producing shirts in a Vietnamese sweat shop, they would. If citizens boycotted a product from a company that kept getting fined for excessive pollution, they&#39;d clean up their act. </p>

<p>We&#39;re not there, though, and so long as people have to buy cheap shit just to get by, we&#39;ll never get there without govt reforms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a lie to pull people against what they think is capitalism but really is corporate socialism. The government is essentially run by banks and corporations which only see profits and do not see a moral or ethical component, because you&#39;d have to have God for that. And they serve mammon. They are purposefully destroying the republic to collapse sovereign nations into even deeper socialism for further control. We exist in a planned economy, controlled by an elite. The only way out is through Jesus Christ because the empire is going to collapse, because that&#39;s the plan. Don&#39;t follow the false revolutionaries that will be feeding on the carcass of the old American republic and fractured Roman Catholic Church. The truth is in God. Now I leave you with the story of Barabbas and Jesus Christ:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve never had a pure capitalist system <em>anywhere</em> on Earth so when people accuse capitalism of being the root of all problems they are heavily mistaken.</p>

<p>Idealogically, I&#39;m opposed to socialism but I recognize that a pure socialist system would &quot;work&quot; just as a pure anarcho capitalist system would &quot;work&quot;.  My personal preference lies with a nationalist republic protecting capitalist trade, a la secession of the Republic of Texas from the failed US union.</p>

<p>When people talk about Obamacare for instance, I would have rather preferred that the government was able to pass a full NHS-styled system of which it&#39;s more closely related to because it would have removed the corporatist layer of state mandated profit for the insurance companies who came out as the only real winners of the ACA.  An NHS system would have worked at least.</p>

<p>Instead we got <em>yet another</em> half assed compromise between a union that is clawing at each others throats to be both pure capitalist and pure socialist, completely divided.  Corporatist elements are taking advantage of our socio-economic civil war and have full control of law makers and representatives resulting in socialist powered capitalism, the scourge known as corporatism.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m very close with some members of socialist secessionist groups and we&#39;ve moved beyond that football team name calling we&#39;re supposed to be doing to each other mandated by corporatist elements today that exist and perpetuate a split right/left country.  We just want to secede from a completely failed union and in our microcosms build and enable real forms of government that we see fit.  And we&#39;re starting to see that we can actually work together to further achieve those means.</p>

<p>In my view, once citizens started seeing other citizens as the enemy (&quot;Those left wing asshole voters got us into obamacare!&quot; / &quot;Those right wing asshole voters neutered obamacare!&quot;) that&#39;s when we lost control of the nation and no amount laws that we attempt to pass to attempt to fix the issue will work.  It&#39;s like a server that&#39;s been infected with a virus, you don&#39;t try to remove the virus and go about your business, you format the machines and if a bios infection is suspected you scrap the machine entirely.</p>

<p>It&#39;s completely absurd to bash the voluntary exchange system.
