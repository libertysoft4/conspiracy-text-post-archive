        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What I posted, which I think led to this, was a picture circulating comparing Nazi Germany to the United States today.  I had a friend tell me I was completely wrong, specifically because he is a grandchild of a Holocaust survivor (how that makes you any more or less qualified than any other person to judge someone else, I know not).  I responded by pointing out that well over 10 Presidents from South America, to Europe, and even Asia have all recently compared what is going on in the United States today to the rise of the Nazis in Germany.  I&#39;m guessing he was very offended by this, and reported me as well as having many other friends report me.  I&#39;m loving this idea that ISP&#39;s are pushing that it&#39;s their right to censor what you have access to (especially their competition) on the internet as &quot;their&quot; 1st Amendment rights.  I guess Corporations are People and Money is Freedom of Speech as well....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Attributed to whom?  And circling back on your false statement: &quot;I think it&#39;s the other way around. Sad, pathetic non reader.&quot;. Most would take that to mean that you&#39;re a &quot; a god or lord believer.&quot;  Sense is the one thing you&#39;re not making.  You correct my very true statement, and then question me for questioning you.  If he did in fact create man in his own image, did he do the same for Neanderthals?  Were they saved by eating flesh and blood too?  By God sacrificing himself..to him self.  Can you honestly say the torture and murder of one man-god can wipe the slate clean for all humanity? Including millions upon milions of murderers?  One man-god life = ~57,000,000 murderers?  The shit doesn&#39;t quite add up in this brain.  Created by man, displaying nothing but human behavior.  Greed, envy, power.  To keep subjects in line.  Its interesting to look to history to see the exact behavior.  Using god and the threats of the afterlife to keep those in control more in control.  We desire so deeply for there to be more that we believe the ridiculous because it says what we want to hear.  I wish I could believe the lies.  Close my eyes and ears to truth. To believe in the unbelievable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well as a Jewish person I find it to be quite an insult, comparing what we have here to Nazi Germany... the USA is NO WHERE near as together as Nazi Germany was, Germany under the leadership of Mein Furher was focused on the one and only task that should be focused on....Rounding up and stopping THE CENTRAL BANKERS....ww2, Germany and the entire &quot;production&quot; was really just a trick by the central bankers to create a long lasting smoke screen...The Zionist central bankers rubbed their hands together everytime a good jew was thrown in the clink, they did so because they knew how the &quot;story&quot; would serve them years down the road....this topic and post are a example of that...jew sympathy=central banker sympathy.</p>

<p>Most of what you know about ww2 are lies and propaganda, beat over and over again into the fragile mind of the citizen of the time, all to simply create a long lasting smokescreem. brought to you by the very central bankers that are in charge today.</p>

<p>So to compare usa to Germany is an insult. USA is not trying to hunt down central bankers, IT SERVES THEM...USA is not creating debt free money for it&#39;s people like Mein Furher did, no, your the masters of money printed as debt...</p>

<p>So really what you are is the KING OF ZIONIST DEBT BASED SLAVERY.</p>

<p>You should all be very proud and hold your heads up high, knowing that you have been bilked by central bankers longer and harder than any who came before you.</p>

<p>Stupid &quot;Jews&quot; protect and shield Zionist central bankers...Intelligent &quot;Jews&quot; understand the truth, are not afraid to talk about it and know that everything in the past is presented as a lie in order to hide the truth</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If my family didn&#39;t escape it before the fervor themselves, which they never really ever spoke of, it gave me a great interest in Germany.  I wondered a long time the attitudes that lead to what happened.  I started noticing more mass mentalities, it really all start with all this garbage programming on tv.  Society created almost equal decay of families the same way war, the first World War traumatized Germans.  There was less community then, as I noticed here growing up, there was more and more hatred towards anyone that thought outside the accepted norm or questioned things of popular opinion.  This has been a long time coming, the 90&#39;s, and then the internet had a big part of it.  Most families started having both parents working full time.  During the Recession after World War I plus the war damages Germany had to pay, family life was very similar to what is happening in America today.  There are many different similiarities and causes, but this left us open for the mindsets and control taking place today, as in Germany post World War I.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually believe that is incorrect, I don&#39;t believe the founding fathers would agree that a company like Verizon providing a service as say an ISP has the right to censor their competition from your connection, or charge them a fee in order for you to see their content as Verizon&#39;s 1st Amendment right.  Especially due to the fact that our infrastructure, Verizon&#39;s, Comcast&#39;s, etc., were all built on tax paying dollars they received, and wasted, to give us one of the shittiest infrastructures compared to Europe and even most of Asia, since they used our taxpaying dollars, they very much should be responsible to us, and we shouldn&#39;t be giving them this money to begin with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Censoring competition is not a freedom of expression situation, is another situation entirely, and is not relevant in this situation. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s how I look at facebook: If I run a newspaper, do I not have the ability to choose which &quot;letters to the editors&quot; I want to publish? </p>

<p>This is the exact same situation for facebook. Ultimately, it is them that are responsible for the content that is published on their servers, so they should have supreme abilities in removing it. </p>

<p>If you think a social network should adhere to 1st amendment values, then by all means you are more than welcome to start one. However, facebook.com, and all pages appearing on that domain, belongs to facebook. If the stock holders wanted to remove all pictures of people wearing red hats, they would be well within their rights to do so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but I love all the retards that use that to try and discredit people.  That&#39;s a &quot;straw man&quot; argument because I don&#39;t have the intelligence to directly apply a combination of thoughts and words to discuss and argue against your point.  In other words, your argument is a straw man lol.  Thank you for contributing to the conversation :D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It stills blows my mind that so many more people died in Russia under Stalin, Jews included, and even the Japanese massacred more in Asia during World War II, yet no one bats an eye.  We were just ready to go into Syria to &quot;liberate&quot; them and secure their chemical weapons, publicly at the dime of Saudi Arabia.  Country for hire?  It&#39;s like we&#39;re everyone&#39;s stooge, or better yet, their hitman.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, like I pointed out, and obviously you aren&#39;t a fan of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> but a troll of it, all people should be allowed to post what they want without fear of being discriminated against, especially when beheading videos were just allowed on facebook again.  Or maybe you support the wrongful discrimination of all Muslims by the actions of an extreme few?  Freedom of Speech is Freedom of Speech, and you must either not be American, or an American who is Communist, fairly obvious.</p>
