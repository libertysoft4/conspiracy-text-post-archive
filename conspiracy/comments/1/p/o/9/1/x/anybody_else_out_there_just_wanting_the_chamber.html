        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Recently, I&#39;ve grown weary. I am so tired of all these left, right, yes, no! charades. I&#39;m sick of the guessing game. I&#39;m ready, take me to a camp. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a veteran, not a SEAL or anything. My MOS was 12B in the Army. I&#39;m fairly certain I&#39;m already on a &quot;potential bad guy&quot; list because of my training in explosives. I share that to give a little perspective to you, but would like to remind you that this isn&#39;t the basis on which I claim to be weary of the charades, and thus ready for camp life. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always belonged here, or someplace like r/conspiracy, even before my Army days. I knew I was joining an evil people, and this may sound weak, but I didn&#39;t have anywhere else to go. Maybe I haven&#39;t found the right place yet. I don&#39;t know... I envy the Afghans. Having a deployment there, where I was on foot in their yards daily, I earned quite a bit of respect for them. They are crafty, they are sneaky, they are driven to keep their place the way they like it. At least that was my take.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t see that here. I haven&#39;t given up all hope, but please, if &quot;they&quot; are sending us to camps, or rolling in tanks anytime soon; I&#39;d rather them do it sooner than later. Not that I see myself as a hero, I&#39;m just sick of guessing. I don&#39;t want to be Swayze in Red Dawn (just kidding he was aweseome), I just want to know for SURE. So I can lay EVERYTHING on the line without GUESSING.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.

    <div class="md"><p>Bless you for the glimpse into your heart. The only wisdom I can offer is something that I&#39;m sure you already know... Fear does not help you, so try to quash it. Embrace the positive and know that you are never alone. </p>

<p>As this new age of awareness dawns more and more of us are turning off the TV and enlightening ourselves to the real truths of this life. We see our reflection in others and are saying goodbye to our fear and egos and embracing the whole of humanity. We are many, we are one and we do have the power to turn this world around for us all. There is a brighter future on the horizon but please be patient. The time indeed is ripe for revolution but we, the people, need to look to ourselves for the change and no longer rely on others. Many of us are making positive changes in our lives living ethically and harmoniously with our brothers and sisters.  We are no longer supporting corporations that put profit before people. We&#39;re spending our money more wisely, supporting local communities and better business models like social enterprise, crowd funding and and shared ownership. We&#39;re changing careers, working wisely for the benefit of others and engaging in public service. We&#39;re turning away from pesticide ridden food and doing our best to protect the earth from real threats such as fracking and GM food. 
We are all the children of humanity and we are growing into our destiny. Be kind to each other and the planet for this is our true nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trying to sound all red dawn meets the hunger games(or maybe I am idk), but if/when this does happen, I want to fight. I agree about wanting it to just happen already, because these threats and conspiracies and stuff is driving me crazy. The waiting game sucks. But I don&#39;t want it to happen just so that we can just deal and accept the way things are happening. I want it to happen so people will finally take action.  It really does seem like the country has just given up and that&#39;s ridiculous. This is our country. This is our home and who the fuck do people think they are that they can just take that away from us? It&#39;s bullshit. Total bullshit and I&#39;m hoping that people will finally wake the fuck up and fight back because honestly, I think we could win that fight. There&#39;s so many people like you, with military backgrounds that have more knowledge than a lot of us. Ffs dude you have training in explosives, you could rig buildings and cars and who knows what else. When push comes to shove its people like you who are going to help the most because of all the training. </p>

<p>I feel like an overdramatic social justice blogger so ill shut up. </p>

<p>TL;DR if this ever does happen I&#39;m gonna pull a Red Dawn all over the place </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you&#39;re saying but I don&#39;t agree or like the way you titled the post. You say you&#39;re weary, and I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re bitter - but a lot of us aren&#39;t weary or bitter and realize that our brothers and sisters are ignorant, not complicit. They don&#39;t deserve the shit storm if it comes. My parents, nieces and nephews don&#39;t. Yours don&#39;t. </p>

<p>You might be ready. I might be too, but a lot of old people aren&#39;t. No kids are. Plenty of nice people who agree the world needs change are hopeful for other ways to it. Whether it&#39;s naive or not doesn&#39;t mean they deserve some shitty end. And if you (the royal You all;whoever) think they do then you aren&#39;t one of the good guys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks a lot, truly. I posted and titled that to start a discussion like this. I agree with you. Sometimes I have to vent to somebody and get some sort of guidance to get my head back on straight. I don&#39;t wish anybody a shitty end, but I do wish that anyone conspiring to create a shitty end be revealed. If that means that these folks attempt in carrying out their plans, well I guess that&#39;s fine. Then we&#39;ll know who they are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We all want reason and structure to the chaos. And I completely agree that sometimes it feels like we&#39;re hanging on a hook waiting for change. I think They like us here - unsure, willing but not able - it makes us good consumers and watchdogs for their missteps (which they correct in real time) and gives a common enemy to the system they&#39;ve convinced us all is right. They can keep building under the guise of them being right (because hey, the lights are still on and no national attacks in 12 years) and dissidents being wrong, and left in the past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact youve grown weary proves their tactics are effective. Bare with me for a moment.</p>

<p>In their (TPTB) point of view, is it better to do this quickly, like a bandaid? Or to draw it out as long as possible? </p>

<p>I believe it is better for them to draw it out. If they immediately pressed for huge change, there would be a collosal opposition towards the movement. Instead, it is better for them to draw it out as long as possible. Make us &quot;weary&quot; and tired, therefore less effective as opposition. Consider it a seige on will power. very effective.</p>

<p>There does seem to be a great lack of looking behind the curtain amongst many in the population, but rest assured, at least <em>some</em> of us are absolutely looking <em>hard</em> behind that curtain.  We just get marginalized by TPTB.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not stopping many of us who are looking though.</p>

<p>I would say that some of us have at least <em>some</em> sort of an idea.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Hell yes there&#39;s a curtain.  A big ugly one that&#39;s designed to keep all the citizenry out, blind, confused, and in a state of constant servitude.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Fuck that, my man.  You shouldn&#39;t want them to put you or any of us in a chamber <em>at all</em>.  Again, as a military man, I&#39;d imagine that you more than most would be all the more ready to fight tooth and nail against being put in a chamber by your own country - the very country you served and fought to protect - at <em>any</em> time.</p>

<p>They are.  They&#39;ve just been doing it <em>super subtly</em> so that the majority of the public don&#39;t notice that that&#39;s what they&#39;re doing.  It&#39;s called the totalitarian tip toe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean, start with busting my door if it means I&#39;m a martyr.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But you won&#39;t be a martyr if you&#39;re in a camp and are okay with it though right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As long as I can do something.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, getting camped up certainly will make it more difficult for us to do something about things than NOT being camped up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If they start with other folks&#39; doors, that&#39;s fine too, I just want an all in or a fold.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Na, my brother.  <a href="http://www.bubblews.com/assets/images/news/1331472522_1381983825.jpg">Fuck a fold</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not folding, I&#39;m just getting sick of waiting.  Know what I mean?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, my brother, but as a military man, you should know that half the battle&#39;s about also knowing <em>when</em> to strike, and some of the best warriors are not so much the strongest ones...but the most patient.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When it comes down to it. I&#39;ll teach everything I know to any freedom fighter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then get your mind out of being okay with the possibility of being encamped.  You are better use to all freedom fighters being <em>outside</em> the camp than inside it.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Don&#39;t mean to sound antagonistic toward you.  I certainly don&#39;t feel antagonistic toward you.  Believe me, I also often feel VERY down and hopeless about the human race and our chances of being able to successfully combat the corruption on this planet.  However, I know that I would much, <em>MUCH</em> rather us die on our feet as a people and as a citizenry than to continue living on our knees.  That&#39;s all.  I just don&#39;t want us to give up.  I&#39;d rather us fight, fight, <em>fight</em> - even if we know that there&#39;s &quot;no hope&quot; and that we are surely going to &quot;lose&quot; if we try to break free from our enslaving bonds.  I would rather that happen than not fight and end up entirely captured and enslaved as a people.</p>

<p>A warrior&#39;s death is almost infinitely better than a coward&#39;s life in my book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I kind of understand your frustration.  I&#39;ve been attached to NORAD and NSA as an active duty military member and I know a lot of droll and uninteresting things that I&#39;m not allowed to disclose until 10 years after my own death, per my clearance outbrief.  But simply being designated as outbriefed from that clearance makes me &quot;potential bad guy&quot;.</p>

<p>But I think you are expecting a clear cut event that will simply not be clear cut.  If there end up being camps, they won&#39;t be identified as camps and few people will know when &quot;listed&quot; citizens are interred there.  </p>

<p>Unless there is a huge coordinated uprising, it&#39;s going to be a quiet and unassuming process that is explained away by MSM.</p>

<p>If they take you to a camp, you likely won&#39;t know you&#39;re going to a camp until you&#39;re there, and your loved ones won&#39;t know it at all, much less the &quot;voting&quot; public.</p>
