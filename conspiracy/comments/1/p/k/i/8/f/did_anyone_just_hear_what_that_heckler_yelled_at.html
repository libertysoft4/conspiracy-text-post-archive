<p>(full &quot;article&quot;)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Several noisy protesters interrupted President Obama’s health care reform rally in Boston on Wednesday afternoon, stopping the commander in chief’s speech dead in its tracks.</p>

<p>The demonstrators shouted for Mr. Obama to “stop the pipeline” and to confront climate change, referencing the controversial Keystone XL pipeline project which the president must personally approve or deny.</p>

<p>Pausing for a few moments, Mr. Obama then attempted to make light of the situation.</p>

<p>“We’re talking about health care today … That is the wrong rally,” he said with a smile, telling the crowd he is in Boston to talk health care, not global warming.</p>

<p>“We had the climate change rally back in the summer. This is the health care rally,” he added.</p>

It&#39;s no different than those professional protesters who always miraculously have a sign in the House gallery then get arrested and thrown out, only to repeat this same feat the next month and say &quot;oh I guess security didn&#39;t recognize me with the 10 morning news shows I did last week about getting dragged out of the House derpety derp&quot;</p>

<p>Last time Joe Biden visited my college, I wanted to attend. They announced the event THE MORNING of the event to the campus at large, then offered tickets. Then when you get there to ask for tickets, oh, sorry, they were all claimed two weeks ago. Were you on the mailing list? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, they vent the feelings of the populace, but in an easily deflected manner.  While climate change is important, it&#39;s a weak logical link to the pipeline, and isn&#39;t a legal concern.  What they <em>should</em> have brought up, was the money trail and conflicts of interest in the use of the public&#39;s government for private business.  High profile, weak logic events are the theme of the new millennium in MSM.</p>

<p>It actually takes far more energy to mine and process and ship than it provides for the end-point user. A very good deal more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It still won&#39;t be good environmentally. It takes resources, trucks and deforestation to build pipelines. I think the protesters don&#39;t want want either the pipeline or moving by truck. They want lower hydrocarbons and 20% of America to have solar panels. </p>

<p>I know the knee-jerk reaction is, &quot;That so extreme. Those environmentalist need to be realistic,&quot; but honestly, it&#39;s not <em>that</em> extreme. It is actually possible. Stop bailing out banks, you could subsidize solar panels, provide a real single payer health care system, build real high speed trains and in general, make society better for the poor and middle class.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s an extreme stance, but the green hippies have to be that extreme, just to get maybe an 1/8 of what they ask for. And even with that, what they ask for...it isn&#39;t even unachievable. We&#39;re just led to think it is so big oil can keep selling us car, petrol and propane. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post!</p>

<p>Just the first $700 million bailout could have paid for the installation of over 40,000 high-end renewable energy systems (at $20,000 per). If net metering and resale to power companies is figured in that&#39;s over 100,000 homes that could be producing ALL of the energy they use (through solar). If wind or micro-hydro is substituted that number goes WAY up.</p>

<p>200,000 (est) Americans could have been both energy-independent AND selling power back to other Americans--OR 14,000 Americans could have gotten a free ride through college...but they used it to cover these assholes&#39; gambling debts instead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understand what the &quot;patch&quot; is. It&#39;s a misnomer - that&#39;s why you don&#39;t see it on satellite images. It&#39;s just a region where very very tiny amounts of plastics are found in higher concentrations than usual, and of course garbage.</p>

<p>Unless of course you&#39;re trying to tell me that there&#39;s continuous patch of garbage and plastic that magically dissapeared from satellite images.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post!</p>

<p>Just the first $700 million bailout could have paid for the installation of over 40,000 high-end renewable energy systems (at $20,000 per). If net metering and resale to power companies is figured in that&#39;s over 100,000 homes that could be producing ALL of the energy they use (through solar). If wind or micro-hydro is substituted that number goes WAY up.</p>

<p>200,000 (est) Americans could have been both energy-independent AND selling power back to other Americans--OR 14,000 Americans could have gotten a free ride through college...but they used it to cover these assholes&#39; gambling debts instead.</p>

<p>Sickening.</p>
