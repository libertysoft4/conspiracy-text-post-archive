<p>It&#39;s tough to post on here sometimes when your opinions are shot down by people that can&#39;t open a tab. I only reiterate this point, because people are still asking for links. </p>

<p>Do your own research, if you are heavily skeptic. It takes the same amounts of time for me to pull up google and find you a link as it does for you to do the same. </p>

<p>Lastly, many of those that ask for links just call bullshit or find a way to continue their argument. So, unless you&#39;re making some outlandish, new claim that hasn&#39;t been circulated in many sources on the internet, then you need a source.</p>

<p>Because, honestly, it&#39;s wasting my life to provide sources for those that are unaware of how their internet works.</p>

<p>This is all over the place..i know.</p>

<p>Edit: For example, if someone tells you, &quot;fuku will kill a third of the sea life&quot;, then all you have to do is copy the parentheses and paste in google (or your preferred researching method). Then you&#39;ll have not only one, but multiple sources. That way you can tell the person that they are misinformed and show them or agree with them and ask them further. Spark productive conversation.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my point. Nothing in between or implied. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone here thinks they already know/have it all figured out, and almost all the time they are not just wrong, but are nowhere close to, ready for it? &quot;The truth&quot;.</p>

<p>Most people in the conspiracy field are like most people in any other walk of real life - they are out for themselves and their interactions with other people mainly tend to center around confirming their own ideas and opinions and using the other people they interact with as tools for vicariously validating their own feelings about themselves. That&#39;s it. It&#39;s what most people do in real life inter-personally, it&#39;s what most people do online, it&#39;s what most conspiracy theorists or anyone of almost any belief system do on the internet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do you think the most important of all commandments is to &quot;treat thy neighbor as thy self&quot;. Consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is right and is absolutely the only right thing to do, even if that neighbor is insane(or you think he&#39;s insane), you have to realize that treating other people as you would treat yourself is not just for them but it is mutually beneficial and the only way to go about living life properly. Everyone should be free and respected as themselves, because <em>their</em> &quot;self&quot; is the same as <em>your</em> &quot;self&quot;. You could just as easily be in their position/in their bodies/as them, you&#39;re another point of awareness/&#39;selfness&#39; created by the universe and entombed in matter experiencing life as a human being, you&#39;re a beacon of perception and the life-force of the universe, and so are they. The two of you are one and the same thing just as 2 different or &quot;separate&quot;(LOL, yeah right) apples growing on an apple tree are one and the same thing. The tree of the universe made you and you are inside of it right now both as one experiencing itself as many(look at quantum physics, that&#39;s actually true, you&#39;re part of the same energies that everyone else is comprised of and we are all made of the same forces/field of energy).</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just hippy or Jesus talk - it&#39;s the real thing. You&#39;re an apple growing out of the tree that is the universe, so is everyone else. You&#39;re part of the tree, they&#39;re part of the tree, you&#39;re both growing together, positive mutual exchange based on respect/awareness and consideration of one another is the only way you &quot;both&quot; grow because harming one is harming yourself, as you are both the same thing/same tree/same many different parts of one alive thing/social life complex. You really are an expression of the life-force OBVIOUSLY INHERENT in the universe, so is everyone else. It has expressed itself through many forms and you are one of them, so is everyone else. Respect them as you would respect yourself because in the larger sense they are YOUR&quot;self&quot;, and your own growth and theirs will be promoted through positive exchange rather than negative or self-serving only exchange.</p>

<p>Morality can be logically proved / indicated. Believe me. You either exude radiance/love(which is our human word for positive energy output/giving/being good and caring - things that create and inspire growth in other people and yourself/mutually beneficial and balanced action)/etc.(the hippies and new agers are right in calling it light, I guess!) and you&#39;re like the sun, giving of itself freely and promoting life/light/growth in everything it touches - OR - you can be completely self-centered and like a black hole, doing nothing but fearing/hating others and trying to pull them into your gravity well to control them, this eventually makes you so far compacted in on yourself inwardly(as you emanate nothing but your ever-present pull and sucking more social/material resources into yourself to feed your disgusting perpetual need for more, as you give nothing, only take) that you don&#39;t let any light out at all, don&#39;t inspire any growth except teaching people to avoid you and how to avoid your type to maintain their own lives - like a sociopath, you GIVE NOTHING, you only TAKE, you suck all the light/good energy given to you by others and use it to feed your vast emptiness - you are like a void zone. These are the two options. Be a sun or a black hole - one inspires growth, the other creates nothing but more of the eternal pull of death/emptiness that it represents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand where you&#39;re coming from but you&#39;re misinterpreting quantum field behavior. I&#39;ll explain if you want but I imagine the literal of QFT wasn&#39;t your point (I just don&#39;t care for you asking others to read into it without providing citation).</p>

<p><strong>Normally I don&#39;t do this but I&#39;m going to quote myself from a gilded comment.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you demonstrate to me an avenue by which one can acquire and retain wealth that is not pursuant of self-interest? I realize that absence of proof is itself not proof but I&#39;m articulating the question for perspective. The avenues of growth available to any altruistic line of thought are inherently limited without assumption of recompense for said altruism. If recompense is a component in the premise of altruism then it cannot be altruism. Let us examine this idea further:</p>

<p>Contemplate the notion that you are preparing to offer an anonymous gift to an arbitrary person. In the absence of preferred selection or personal association, altruism seems to be irrefutably pure as an idea. The notion of the generosity is itself in this context admirable in that regard; a pure act of altruism. Or is it?</p>

<p>The action itself being admirable is something your ego is aware of. Although you may not reap direct material benefit, the psychological benefit is indisputable. Some part of you will feel fundamentally better, furthered by the act of giving. The notion of warm-fuzzy-goodness as an abstract reward to an anonymous charitable event is itself a thing that your ego can and does pursue.</p>

<p>The seemingly arbitrary gesture of generosity itself is not at all arbitrary; it&#39;s self-serving at the most fundamental level. You aren&#39;t generous for the sake of others, you&#39;re generous for the sake of self. You might carry this argument philosophically toward the notion that we are conscious beings are fundamentally restricted to our perceptions colored by our paradigms and therefore it&#39;s unreasonable to assert there&#39;d be anymore to us...and you&#39;d be right.</p>

<p>There is nothing external to your perception that tells you I or any other person exists. Or any other thing exists, for that matter. In fact, for all intents and purposes, you could very well be god and not even realize it. Divinity in that matter is irrelevant; what matters is that reality is a matter of your perceptions. It is colored by what you believe is right, wrong, good, evil, etc.</p>

<p>I propose that there are no unselfish actions and furthermore that we are incapable of unselfish acts. We are fundamentally motivated by self and therefore greed is an inherent extension of a paradigm which prescribes self propagation. The accumulation of wealth not occurring or maintaining arbitrarily, greed is not only inherent; it is necessary.</p>

<p>None of this means we must be self-serving at all times; in fact the stability of our ego demands (for most of us) that we maintain an illusion in which are are good and justified. What actions this pursuit is composed of are strictly colored by the individual and may readily conflict in imposing and confrontational ways with others. Ultimately that it does is irrelevant; we&#39;re interested in serving our paradigm of ego and nothing more.</p>

<p>Thus I propose that the pursuit of wealth is, by necessity, one of self-interest and inherently greedy in nature. Implying nothing of the character or paradigm of the individual, this idea merely suggests that one readily values self higher than others it perceives. I am skeptical that I will live to observe any being that exists and lives contrary to this premise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not disputing the impact of positive or negative attitude exuded toward others because that can color their interpretation of an environment they act in. That interpretation itself is not significantly influential of the properties of the environment in the majority of cases. It can influence the paradigm of the individual, but having said that:</p>

<p><em>A wolf doesn&#39;t see brethren when it wakes among a flock of sheep, nor does one sheep graze with the intent of leaving grass for those in its wake.</em></p>

<p>Morality is a matter of paradigm and perspective. Not all of the right choices are easily made. The greater your awareness of the impact you have, the further ahead you think, the harder it is to make these choices.</p>

<p>You can tell me all you want about love, living in the present and giving freely. I will tell you that I cannot give what I do not have and I cannot have what is not given to me unless I take it. All of the positive thoughts I have to offer you will amount to exactly the amount of capability you have to capitalize on it. If I am myself incapable, no amount of well-wishing will change this. If I am capable but inactive, I may be motivated by your wishes. Do you have the foresight to understand which is which? Do you have the strength to take accountability if you&#39;re wrong?</p>

<p><strong>The world is neither exclusively roses or shit. It&#39;s both. Flowers growing in shit. They&#39;re not mutually exclusive. You should pay mind to which it is you&#39;re taking a whiff of.</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t mind your critique or anything, really, and I think I understand where YOU&#39;RE coming from, but you didn&#39;t understand where I am coming from at all if you think that &quot;I&#39;m misinterpreting quantum field behavior&quot; by suggesting we are all created by/made of/animated by the same thing is relevant. I am however open to further conversation if I am mistaking your meaning, but let me respond to what I think you&#39;ve said first. Do you believe in the big bang? Do you believe that there is some other source of energy that comprises everything OTHER THAN the universe that we live in? If you believe in multiple universes, and those rest in a field, then do you think those are siphoning energy from something that is entirely disconnected for everything else in order to form it&#39;s own creations within the various universes? What do you think you are experiencing and &quot;inside of&quot;/included in right now other than a vast soup of one interconnected amalgamation of the same interconnected energy interpreted by your brain as matter and as &quot;separateness&quot; and &quot;space&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You are the one making an arbitrary distinction. One benefiting itself IS benefiting the &quot;other&quot; when the other is an extension of &quot;self&quot;, as both come out of the same thing and both are living portions of the same one living whole, as in, &quot;separate&quot; apples growing out of the same tree, being created by the tree, deriving their life force from the tree, and expressing by virtue of their existence the inner natures of and underlying realities inherent to the tree they are growing out of. There is a difference between being generous to build up your own idea of yourself and actually being &quot;loving&quot;(or having your particular nature be the type that radiates positive energy output based on how human beings use the word/sound &quot;positive&quot;) as you seem to understand by your distinguishing between positive action and positive action in hopes of recompense.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, uh huh, but how is slipping into solipsism at all relevant to us here? That&#39;s all well and good, it&#39;s a great way to feel like you&#39;re in complete control of your life and a good way to start down the path of taking responsibility for yourself and for everyone else in your environment(because in that frame of reference they <em>ARE STILL</em> extensions of your &quot;self&quot;ness&quot;) and your effect on them when you&#39;re young or in your early 20s / don&#39;t control anything else / and are still figuring things out for yourself, but when you reach a certain point you either have to let go of that and accept for yourself that other humans are &#39;real&#39; and in the same position as you, or go the delusional route and think that you&#39;re a god because you can get other people to do what you want(and people DO do this with astoundingly negative consequences).</p>

<p>There are two basic ways to &quot;get by&quot; as a human being, one is serving yourself, the other is embracing and cultivating genuine concern for others and losing yourself/your own &quot;needs&quot; and &quot;problems&quot; your striving to do good things for/&quot;serve&quot; others - which will indeed serve yourself as well. <strong>The implication of what I am saying to begin with ALREADY IS that there is nothing but one, and only one &quot;self&quot; to begin with, so the distinction between self and &quot;other&quot; that you are harping on doesn&#39;t really matter</strong>. Those apples on the one tree are all interacting, they all came out of the one tree, we are the apples, the energy that forms and comprises the universe of which we are a part is the tree. Whether I&#39;m &quot;misinterpreting the quantum field etc&quot; has absolutely nothing to do with anything and is entirely irrelevant(because I&#39;m not &quot;interpreting quantum field behavior&quot; in any way that you have taken the meaning of correctly, and it does not a very relevant impact to the overall essence of my post.) and was not a big part of what I said beyond using physics to imply that I&#39;m not talking purely about some kind of new-age phenomenon but rather the logical implication of one giant cloud of energy forming beings like humans, planets, stars, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Morality is a matter of paradigm and perspective. Not all of the right choices are easily made. The greater your awareness of the impact you have, the further ahead you think, the harder it is to make these choices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This I know all too well personally. How again is this relevant? I have found in my own life that, overwhelmingly, being genuinely good/loving/true to others and myself in any given situation is the best way to make that situation go &quot;right&quot; for everyone involved, so not to worry there. Every big drama in life is full of small choices on the parts of all the actors, smaller series of events and inter-actions that make the whole play or the whole drama, if everyone was functioning on the level I suggest is best it would all turn out as well as it possibly could for everyone involved, more times than not, given fate is not working against you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If recompense is a component in the premise of altruism then it cannot be altruism. Let us examine this idea further:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How this is relevant I don&#39;t know, as altruistic recompense is one of the simple implications OF altruism, others around you are more than likely to mirror back toward you(and others, potentially, depending on how large an impact you have on them and their lives with your &quot;goodness&quot; or &quot;badness&quot; toward them) what you give to them. A brother loving and giving toward his brother out of one of the only truly widely understood forms of human altruism(the kind toward your immediate family) is usually not an action taken to make the giving brother feel better about himself although his &#39;personal identity&#39; may be involved in his decisions to behave altruistically, it is <em>actually</em> altruistic, and will more often than not naturally generate &quot;recompense&quot;. This doesn&#39;t make it a purely selfish action, but to understand what I am saying you already need to re-think your idea of the definition of the word &quot;self&quot; AND &quot;selfish&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can tell me all you want about love, living in the present and giving freely. I will tell you that I cannot give what I do not have and I cannot have what is not given to me <strong>unless I take it.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>...you can&#39;t take what isn&#39;t given, and if you do there will be negative consequences for the people involved as it&#39;s a violation of the respect that you should have for the will of others - analogous to taking too much from a small forest and killing off the life that it was playing host to before you decided to <em>take what wasn&#39;t given or offered</em> by it/it&#39;s life-forms. In human beings this would be something like rape or callous/forceful/violent action or imposing your will on an-other without their consent.</p>

<p>You&#39;re typing like someone who likes the idea of solipsism and arguing in a way that isn&#39;t really within the context of what I said, in my opinion. The reason that more people don&#39;t actually hold or defend solipsistic views is specifically because to lead meaningful lives that include other people you have to recognize and respect their being-ness in the same way you would require them to respect yours if you desire to be left alone/unharmed/interact with them in a positive way for yourself/keep living. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You can choose to &quot;see&quot; things whatever way you like and take whatever perspective of events that suit you, but it doesn&#39;t change anything that I said about interacting with other human beings. A murderer or rapist can take a fond and happy view of his crimes, it doesn&#39;t mean that they <em>actually are</em> &quot;fond and happy&quot; just because he is petty or small-minded enough(as in, lacking in his ability to perceive or his ability to care about the other people who he effected and their perceptions), and these actions will eventually lead to his downfall as powerfully negative ones nearly always do. He could be locked in prison for life and still &quot;choose to take a happy perspective&quot; of his crimes and think he&#39;s good and he &quot;took what he wanted&quot;, in reality it would have been better for him to <strong>follow my thinking and advice and get over himself and how he want to see himself in his own mind</strong>. When you are using others as a vicarious mechanism of serving your own ego, you aren&#39;t helping anyone, and although it may SEEM LIKE IT to the childish in the moment - it is NOT serving the person who is doing it. It is protecting them from having to deal with reality like a grown up and protecting them from honest self-reflection and responsibility-for-self, and allows them to do basically anything so long as they can maintain whatever childish/petty solipsistic lie they are telling themselves, and get other people to play along with it and validate it either out of pity or desire or whatever it is -- <strong>otherwise they will have to run away from and can&#39;t interact with that person unless it is to hurt or ignore them in order to serve-self and maintain their solipsistic lie</strong>. This makes them weak and incapable, not strong and smart. It means they are lying to themselves and are incapable of dealing with &quot;real life&quot; in any other way, probably because they are too young mentally or too unevolved as people to do it, they just aren&#39;t there yet - and that&#39;s fine - but it&#39;s dangerous and deprives both them and others of real/deep/meaningful interaction, as when you view life and people this way(solipsistically) you are incapable of anything BUT using them for feeding your ego and using them for momentary/shallow self-gratification. <strong>It&#39;s equivalent to taking human beings and turning them into cigarettes you light, smoke, and have to throw away because you&#39;re not really strong enough or deep enough to deal with them on a mutually &quot;real&quot; level.</strong> It is an indication of weakness to need to lie to yourself to maintain a pleasant-to-yourself internal image of self, and to need to use others to serve and prove that lie to yourself endlessly. You become, like I said, a human black hole. An empty space who can be &quot;fun&quot; and seemingly interesting, but really having no substance and contributing nothing but wants.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny because really I think you are being how I think you are implying that <em>I</em> am being. I am not talking about beliefs or personal ideals, I am talking about logical and correct reasoning/right inference and governing our conduct with others in most mutually beneficial way. Yes, this includes &quot;self-serving&quot;, but as other &quot;selves&quot; are another version of or extension of the same source of energy that you are, you are going to be serving yourself and others by doing basically anything positive/&quot;moral&quot;(by expressing your own unique personal energy onto the world), all you have a choice in is whether those actions of yours are going to be positive and growth inspiring or negative(and potentially growth inspiring only by teaching others the lessons that you should be learning yourself in order to not have to behave so negatively).</p>

<p><strong>TLDR: I think I know what you think you&#39;re saying, but I don&#39;t think you have a very good understanding of what I am saying</strong>. Your existence is thanks to the tree that spawned you as an expression of itself and it&#39;s own characteristics(because where else did they come from? magic?), where you go with intelligent awareness/life/freedom of expression is up to you, but you have to respect others having the same thing or you will harm yourself by harming them. You are an expression of the same vast fields of energy in pinpointed locations on one big globule of it that we call a planet. You are harping on points that have no meaning in this context or are not relevant, because if they were I would have addressed them! Serving others is serving yourself, as they are a part of you and your life/perceptions, and you are a part of theirs - the meaning of coming together starts with mutual respect and caring - otherwise it is just service to self THROUGH others. Be a positive one or get yourself into trouble, treat others like you would want yourself to be treated, or you will either deprive yourself of most of what is important in life(your interactions with other life forms), or be legally/personally prosecuted by the &quot;other selves&quot;. You&#39;re actually many expressions of one life-force/energizing force that animates all of us, and we reflect one another to each other as mirrors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>PART THREE</strong></p>

<p><strong>Friendship</strong></p>

<p>Friendships aren&#39;t defined by the good times you share together. They&#39;re defined by the hardships. A friend is someone who will come running at 3:00 AM if you call. Anyone else is just an acquaintance. You may disagree with this but if I&#39;d let that stop me, I&#39;d not have written any of it.</p>

<p>The philosophy you espouse regarding what friendship is begins with your interpretation of what a friend will and will not do for you. In your opinion they should positively reinforce the foundation of your paradigm of values whenever you&#39;re diverging from it. You&#39;ve just enshrined the definitions of your paradigm as absolutes, which simply isn&#39;t broadly applicable. Friendship is born in contexts favorable to your paradigm to begin with and has no absolute boundaries. Let&#39;s have an example:</p>

<p>The best man at your wedding is likely a friend. The guy who helps you hide a body in the desert? He&#39;s definitely your friend. Is it because you both share a common interest? Yes. Is that common interest inherently related to self? To the degree in which your preservation offers fulfillment which extends beyond that of self preservation. The two are not alike. </p>

<p>One of them is engaging in a social affair in the context of a commonly held ritual. You chose them because they mean something to you and you think the same is true for them. That assumption is true to exactly the spectrum upon which it has been evaluated. If you&#39;ve had a lot of good times together, you&#39;re friends so long as that is the case. </p>

<p>The person helping you hide the body is not a friend of convenience. In fact they&#39;re willing to put themselves at risk in order to address the situation. They agree to share the burden of a very bad time with you. Although you say the friend who assists in making bad decisions isn&#39;t a friend as they&#39;re merely reinforcing the lies you tell your solipsistic self, I disagree. This is the friend who is putting their ass on the line for you. Besides, I could say the same thing about the best man letting you make terrible decisions but then I&#39;d just be salting the wound by bringing up <em>why</em> we have to hide a body.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s equivalent to taking human beings and turning them into cigarettes you light, smoke, and have to throw away because you&#39;re not really strong enough or deep enough to deal with them on a mutually &quot;real&quot; level. It is an indication of weakness to need to lie to yourself to maintain a pleasant-to-yourself internal image of self, and to need to use others to serve and prove that lie to yourself endlessly. You become, like I said, a human black hole. An empty space who can be &quot;fun&quot; and seemingly interesting, but really having no substance and contributing nothing but wants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s another assumption on your part. Not that I don&#39;t appreciate where you&#39;re coming from at this point. The humor in it is that you believe that anyone intends to be dishonest with themselves. They don&#39;t. That doesn&#39;t mean that we&#39;re honest with ourselves, though.</p>

<p>Once again you come from a position where you assume you have perfect knowledge. You cannot make true assessments of yourself from within yourself because your perception will always be colored by your paradigm. You will perceive whatever it is you want to as being true and that&#39;s generally the end of it. That doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re always going to believe pleasant things about yourself; sometimes you make exceptional trade-offs in order to rationalize your awareness of external perception.</p>

<p>This does not mean that a person uses and discards people without any sense of empathy. Being aware that your motivations are egocentric by their nature can enable you to understand when people are truly precious to you. The reason that they are is, like morality, arbitrary and ultimately irrelevant. If it&#39;s precious because it loves my poetry or because it puts the lotion on it&#39;s skin before it gets the hose, it&#39;s still precious.</p>

<p>My paradigm is not devoid of of empathy, nor is it intent of dishonesty. There is no abstract sense of obligation to morality as proposed by external sources but morality does exist as an internal interpretation of experiencing the perspectives of others. The distinction is that all positions taken are a choice relative to the specific context without absolutes. It is the belief that one can freely reserving judgment about the murderer and rapist until the context of the events is fully understood. It is the belief that no party inherently deserves the benefit of the doubt strictly because of presentation. That all actions and all persons are done for reasons that were equally valid to that individual who acted upon them. Therefore, whenever it is that a judgement is made about a person in one way or another it is regarding my opinion of the validity of their motivation to take that action, rather than the action they took.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Governance, Prosperity and Morality</strong></p>

<p>You not wrong, in a sense. In another sense, you aren&#39;t even wrong. Where you first diverge is in the interpretation of scope with respect to morality and governance. This something that is difficult to overcome with a sense of external moral boundaries set upon you about absolute right and wrong.</p>

<p>You state that you&#39;ve arrived at the logical conclusion and correct reasoning/right inference as governing our conduct with others in the most mutually beneficial way. This statement itself is a paradox because you are not a super-observer external to the system. You are a member of the system and therefore your knowledge is imperfect. If your knowledge is imperfect then your morality is arbitrary, best intentions be damned.</p>

<p>Mutually beneficial as a concept of existence is a wonderful idea that is fundamentally incompatible local consciousness. It requires perfect knowledge and total equality of perception among all others relative to self. Unfortunately the only individuals capable of reaching this state are those who are capable of shutting down empathy for others altogether. This isn&#39;t for lack of want or intent by any individual but instead a consequence of the inability to obtain perfect knowledge. Our perception of truth and the truth itself are vastly different things. With only the perception of truth we cannot reasonably delegate what is or isn&#39;t serving the mutual interest. We can merely tell ourselves that it is our intention to do so. In this sense true equality itself is not possible. Because of this, immoral decisions enacted upon some may ultimately be pursuant of the moral decision reflecting the many.</p>

<p>You speak of the actions of individuals as being an inspiration of positive or negative growth for observers as if the paradigms of those individuals will not impact their interpretation of which they are. To that end, one man can be a chameleon and many things to many others, one at a time. But for a man to something to many people at once is to be like a tiger. Something that is simultaneously watched, feared, admired and loathed. At any given moment it is both a savior to some and a terror to others, but never is it capable of being all things to all men. This is the nature of leadership.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TLDR: I think I know what you think you&#39;re saying, but I don&#39;t think you have a very good understanding of what I am saying. Your existence is thanks to the tree that spawned you as an expression of itself and it&#39;s own characteristics(because where else did they come from? magic?), where you go with intelligent awareness/life/freedom of expression is up to you, but you have to respect others having the same thing or you will harm yourself by harming them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re grossly misinterpreting me. If anything I have stated in the most certain terms imaginable that I believe in the validity of others, that they choose actions they believe are right or wrong. I do not deny their freedom anymore than it is imposing upon mine. That said, I don&#39;t arbitrarily respect any more than I arbitrarily judge. I&#39;ll grant that anyone has the right to their desires but I won&#39;t simply surrender myself to their whims because someone else believes that they&#39;re entitled to that right unless I agree with them.</p>

<p>You seem to believe in a world of pure light and joy. I tell you, this vision you have of such a world blinds you from reality and the simplest truth of our existence: There can be no light without shadow, for without it the light has no meaning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are an expression of the same vast fields of energy in pinpointed locations on one big globule of it that we call a planet. You are harping on points that have no meaning in this context or are not relevant, because if they were I would have addressed them! Serving others is serving yourself, as they are a part of you and your life/perceptions, and you are a part of theirs - the meaning of coming together starts with mutual respect and caring - otherwise it is just service to self THROUGH others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are persistent of your paradigm, as I should expect. You continue to assert about unity and working toward others, completely ignoring the fact that your mind is entirely local. You can only have the knowledge that you perceive. You can only gain knowledge as colored by the paradigm that you have. You assert that this knowledge and paradigm you have is absolute truth to everyone, utterly unaware that it is absolutely truth only to yourself.</p>

<p>I am the collective expression of many lives that have come before me, not a single life. Knowledge is not omnipresent and we are not omniscient. You claim to pursue love and the well of all others, yet you are judgmental, presumptuous and bellowing of your worldly nature through the soft skin on your hands. You tell me of your gifted life and your grand, perfect paradigm. Tell me, what wonders have you brought forth with it? How many lives have you saved? How many destinies have you shaped? How many people have you given hope where there was no hope left for them to find?</p>

<p>When you can answer these questions in a way that will bring you honor, answer them and I will regard you with the utmost sincerity. Until you are able, I see a naive idealist that I once was and left behind, many years ago.</p>

<p><strong>QFT, Space and Time</strong></p>

<p>Spatial perception is inherent in and of itself but it&#39;s definition is given by the passage of time. From an exterior perception a quantum system does not observe the passage of time. This is because a quantum system is static until it interacts with something. Time itself is a product of entanglement between particles that interact. Except not all particles are interacting with all other particles at all frames of measurement from the perspective of any given particle. I&#39;ll give you an example:</p>

<p>The speed of light in a vacuum is absolute, so long as the properties of the vacuum are absolute. The properties of the light itself don&#39;t change as the travels in an absolute vacuum until it collides with something. Except the nature of the vacuum itself isn&#39;t absolute because the relativistic properties of space produce curvatures. The light, internally, isn&#39;t changing properties but the relative properties it can be measured against at one point or another are not inherently the same. In one place the light is blue and in another that same light is red. Why? Because the wavelength of red light in one location is not the same as red light in another.</p>

<p>Quantum Field Theory will tell you there is no time or space truly between us to an super-observer who does not exist within our system because any interaction will inherently interfere with all other events in the system. The misconception here is that you or I are super observers for which this rule applies. We are members of the system and for us the consequence of time and space is very real property. The only one who sees us as all the same thing is the four dimensional alien astronomer observing the three dimensional black hole. Some people call him god and all powerful but I&#39;m pretty sure he has no idea what he&#39;s looking at when he peers through his telescope and masturbates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can choose to &quot;see&quot; things whatever way you like and take whatever perspective of events that suit you, but it doesn&#39;t change anything that I said about interacting with other human beings. A murderer or rapist can take a fond and happy view of his crimes, it doesn&#39;t mean that they actually are &quot;fond and happy&quot; just because he is petty or small-minded enough(as in, lacking in his ability to perceive or his ability to care about the other people who he effected and their perceptions), and these actions will eventually lead to his downfall as powerfully negative ones nearly always do. He could be locked in prison for life and still &quot;choose to take a happy perspective&quot; of his crimes and think he&#39;s good and he &quot;took what he wanted&quot;, in reality it would have been better for him to follow my thinking and advice and get over himself and how he want to see himself in his own mind. When you are using others as a vicarious mechanism of serving your own ego, you aren&#39;t helping anyone, and although it may SEEM LIKE IT to the childish in the moment - it is NOT serving the person who is doing it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Paradigms of Righteousness</strong></p>

<p>You made a very astute observation in the scope of murderers and rapists about self interest and the ego. What you&#39;re missing is that the scope of the ego and self interest isn&#39;t inherently limited to those individuals. Although it may not be as obvious in other situations, it&#39;s still the case. You choose to differentiate the nature of self interest and satisfying the ego because it suits your paradigm to disassociate the nature of your motivation as contrary to that of those you look down upon. </p>

<p>You distinguish yourself from those individuals as someone who embraces the idea of love, friendship and the value of acting for the sake of others. But you aren&#39;t acting for the sake of others, you&#39;re acting for the sake of yourself. You gain fulfillment by introspection of your decisions in this manner because you believe your actions are justified and that you are helping others. Whether or not you actually are is another matter entirely and irrelevant to the decision. Even if it turns out horribly for the other person because of your well meaning intervention you&#39;ll still feel positive for having done what you thought was right unless it&#39;s proven to the contrary. </p>

<p>This goes beyond the scope of your perception of the consequences any decision you make ultimately has. You may very well never notice the people you&#39;ve hurt by helping the ones you did. In the end though, it won&#39;t matter. You will excuse yourself from the outcome saying that you meant only to do what was right. Let me show you an example:</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>PART TWO</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Victim</strong></p>

<p>A girl is raped at knife point, her boyfriend comes to her rescue as the rapist flees, she calls the police and when they respond in a tragic case of mistaken identity they shoot the boyfriend thinking he&#39;s the rapist. The girl is taken to the hospital, crying her eyes out, where she identifies the man who raped her after a DNA test. The man goes to prison for life.</p>

<p><strong>The Accident</strong></p>

<p>A rapist takes a woman hostage at knife point and says &#39;Bandana&#39;. She consents, pleading not to kill her. She would have fought back but she recognizes the voice and the word. The victim&#39;s boyfriend discovers the event as it&#39;s happening and comes to the rescue of the victim. The rapist flees from the armed boyfriend now chasing him. The victim calls dispatch to report she&#39;s been raped by an armed man and that the rapist is now fleeing. A police officer in the area responds immediately to the dispatch and crashes into the parking lot just in time to spot a man sprinting away with a weapon in hand. Believing the rapist will escape, the police officer shoots, killing the victim&#39;s boyfriend instantly when he hits his heart. The victim is taken to the hospital where a rape kit finds two samples of semen but no injuries associated with an actual rape. The police use the sample to identify the boyfriend and the rapist. The victim realized it was her scorned lover who was trying to play out a fantasy but called the police when her boyfriend caught them because she couldn&#39;t face him. She tells no one, believing it would destroy her reputation and deeply upset the dead boyfriend&#39;s family if they ever knew. The police arrest her rapist, an innocent man who will now die serving a life sentence.</p>

<p>What you&#39;ll see is the story of the victim. That&#39;s not what happened but it&#39;s what you&#39;ll learn about. It will leave you incensed with the indecency of humanity and you may reach out to support the person responsible for the whole thing, thinking you were doing the right thing. Are you wrong to do this? Knowing the whole story, yes you are. The truth is irrelevant, though. Your perception of what is true is all that matters. It&#39;s not that the truth isn&#39;t there or that you couldn&#39;t know, but you&#39;d never ask because that would be &#39;wrong&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>otherwise they will have to run away from and can&#39;t interact with that person unless it is to hurt or ignore them in order to serve-self and maintain their solipsistic lie. This makes them weak and incapable, not strong and smart. It means they are lying to themselves and are incapable of dealing with &quot;real life&quot; in any other way, probably because they are too young mentally or too unevolved as people to do it, they just aren&#39;t there yet - and that&#39;s fine - but it&#39;s dangerous and deprives both them and others of real/deep/meaningful interaction, as when you view life and people this way(solipsistically) you are incapable of anything BUT using them for feeding your ego and using them for momentary/shallow self-gratification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Morality and Ego</strong></p>

<p>You&#39;re interpreting morality in absolutes. Your paradigm is right and other paradigms are wrong, unjustifiable because they&#39;re simply not yet qualified to your level of existence. Well, let me first clarify to you how an organic brain makes decisions:</p>

<p>The human brain is a democracy that votes on ideas relative to the knowledge it holds. When information is gained it is categorized relative to the context in which it is gained and associated with present information. Any key properties also associated with other strongly held properties are incorporated. When the brain acts to reason with knowledge it has it must attempt to relate association between one thing and another. It does this by defining the parameters of what one thing is and isn&#39;t. It&#39;s not a binary outcome; there&#39;s a vote based on the neurons containing the information about what something is or isn&#39;t. That is why you can say a cloud looks like a dinosaur.</p>

<p>Now, onto morality. Morality is a process of reasoning, no different than any other process. It is purely contextual and varies heavily between individuals. It does resolve a number of things based on associating the self in the position of the subject and evaluating interpretation of behavior but this is only applicable with circumstances that you believe are enacted upon those of equal standing. Those you dismiss or elevate for any reason will have significantly different outcomes and the reasoning behind them will be arbitrary. This leads to your morality itself having arbitrary standards and contradictory exceptions which you don&#39;t perceive as such. Ironically, it is these nuanced elements which you will become particularly self-righteous about due to their lack of valid associative reinforcement to reason. You will do this because you have an inherently strong positive association with this arbitrary property and choose to elevate it artificially above the reasoning of morality. You will do the same thing with strong negative associations as well.</p>

<p>So, what does this have to do with friendship? Well, if we can comprehend that morality itself is as arbitrary property then we can&#39;t expect or even demand that those we call friends should inherently agree or disagree. However, because it&#39;s arbitrary, we&#39;ll by nature seek those who generally agree. You call this approach solipsistic and I find this somewhat ironic. You&#39;re asserting that others who disagree with your arbitrary paradigm of morality are invalid because of some qualifying condition they have not yet met. That is the very definition of being solipsistic and, true to form, you carry this notion into what a friendship is and isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Also, this is the one thing I didn&#39;t reply to in my earlier major reply - but I do have an answer for it that I think is a really good one, personally.</p>

<p>What is your idea of wealth? I grew up with enough of everything, I have been &quot;set for life&quot; basically for life, I know people who aren&#39;t and I feel bad for them and try to help them and I don&#39;t expect anything back from them - but the true wealth I &quot;gain from&quot; them is in their friendship and in our mutual consideration for one another.</p>

<p>If they aren&#39;t on my level mentally I take the lesser &quot;treasure&quot; of adding to my personal/private &quot;wealth&quot; of knowing that I did something that I consider truly meaningful: helping another human being in a way that no one else did, and truly improving their life, if only for the moment or for a day or for a week or until it turns the other way again - and then I would help then again if I had the power to. This is the lesser wealth because it&#39;s an appreciation of them only in the abstract form of &quot;adding to my idea of myself and my own life&quot;, if they are on a different mental level than me and we cannot really relate to one another. But it&#39;s still &quot;increasing my wealth&quot;.</p>

<p>Like I said, I have enough of everything, I have all the toys that I could really want or use, I have everything covered and I try to help everyone I could help cover their own lives in any possible way - because that is &quot;wealth&quot; to me. I tell you I have enough of everything and am &#39;set for life&#39; because it means that I know what &quot;wealth&quot; really is and what material wealth really does for you, where it takes you, and what/how it enables you to live better. But there is a point where that <strong>doesn&#39;t&#39; contribute any more to your existence</strong> and you are left unhappy, bored, feeling meaningless and without purpose. You can have all the money in the world, millions of dollars, you could buy anything or anyone(prostitutes/&quot;friends&quot;/etc.) - but they aren&#39;t really your friends, and they aren&#39;t really contributing to your personal &quot;wealth&quot; at all, nor is your money - your piles of money do nothing but allow you to continue your existence.</p>

<p>Altruistic action and cultivating mutual respect/compassion for and with people is what gives you &quot;real&quot; wealth, not real in the physical sense, but real in the human/meaning-of-life sense which in my mind is much more real than the survival kind(because I have always had enough money - I&#39;ve lived on my own away from family and without a trust fund so I do know what needing to survive and not having enough is - but I still knew that even if I had all the food/rent money I needed, it wouldn&#39;t really increase my &quot;wealth&quot; on a real level). Altruistic action / losing your own self-serving-ness in serving and caring for the needs of others is what brings you a. love, b. a loving boyfriend or girlfriend, husband or wife, c. good and true friends, d. a fulfilling career assuming you aren&#39;t a sociopath who derives his pleasure and meaning from fucking people over, in which case you would be better suited to do something that does nothing BUT increase your financial wealth or material assets - but eventually you too will probably find yourself feeling empty and lacking, psychologically lacking, &quot;spiritually&quot; lacking(as in, whatever word you consider proper to use to describe the &quot;deeper meaning&quot; that people derive from human life which fills them up and makes them happy and allows THEM to grow and allows them to inspire growth in OTHERS).</p>

<p>Think of your brother or sister or any close family member. You are in a business relationship - fucking them over and NOT BEHAVING ALTRUISTICALLY may net you millions of dollars, but even if you make off with the money and get away with it, you will have lost something of INFINITELY, INDESCRIBABLY GREATER VALUE - a loving family member and true friend who you could have mutually depended on for life. The altruistic course in your behavior toward other people will increase your &#39;wealth&#39; more than fucking everyone over and trying desperately to gain any wealth and all resources - what you&#39;re describing is analogous to a forest where there is one particular tree who wants only to gain for himself by any means necessary, so he <em>forces</em> his roots out in every direction, stealing the resources from and strangling the life out of his fellow trees in the forest. He grows and grows due to his actions based on his fear of loss/not having enough/fear of others/desire to be the most powerful and have influence over the whole forest(thus spreading his roots out in every direction and using all available resources) - this tree is eventually left alone as he kills off the rest of the forest who he should have been acting in mutually-beneficial cooperation with(altruism, that is), he is eventually the only tree left alive, he is now totally alone having killed everyone else off - he has nothing, as he is existing all available resources, and eventually he dies alone having sucked up all resources of the environment and taken everything he possibly could from others around him by force. Harming the others and acting only for himself and his own welfare HARMS his welfare in the long run, it does not help him, and it certainly does not help all the &quot;nice&quot;/&quot;loving&quot;/&quot;altruistic&quot; trees and plants around him who are acting in a balanced and mutually cooperative / mutually beneficial manner rather than trying to take everything it is possible for them to take.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not figuratively increasing it, it&#39;s literally increasing it. Your wealth is such that the inherent definition of wealth as defined by the means to survive are not a concern. Therefore the value of traditional wealth has no meaning to you, who has never gone wondering when they will next eat or where they will next sleep. In that sense, the meaning of wealth to you is that which your existing means cannot inherently buy. Therefore you value the genuine affection of peers, which you say (somewhat correctly) that money cannot buy.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s evaluate the circumstances of your existence. You&#39;ve had no inherent obligations forced upon you in order to maintain your existence. Therefore your time is liberated from the mandatory actions that most of us must undertake to stay alive. You are free to use that time to pursue things that have more meaning to you, such as friendship. You have the means to participate in events, travel and enjoy the company of others at your leisure. You may think that money cannot buy you &#39;real friends&#39; but you are incorrect. Money allows you the freedom to form genuine friendships more readily that you would have been able to otherwise. It is the foundation of your present ability to define the as the company of friends, where-as for the majority of others are still struggling to build that platform.</p>

<p>You may believe that your actions are inherently giving in nature because they do not seek a return in the sense of values you define as a &#39;return&#39;. It is your definition of what is and is not a return of investment that is obfuscated by your interpretation of what the pursuit of wealth actually is. It is the pursuit of freedom to spend your time as you desire, rather than as you are obligated.</p>

<p>Now, you tell me that you spend your time in the company of building friendships to increase your wealth. Why? Because their company increases the value (re: enjoyment) of the time you have to spend in one way or another. It grants you fulfillment for the time you spend. In other words, you&#39;re never acting for the sake of others arbitrarily. You&#39;re acting for the sake of yourself. You know why? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Think of your brother or sister or any close family member. You are in a business relationship - fucking them over and NOT BEHAVING ALTRUISTICALLY may net you millions of dollars, but even if you make off with the money and get away with it, you will have lost something of INFINITELY, INDESCRIBABLY GREATER VALUE - a loving family member and true friend who you could have mutually depended on for life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Because you are the only person who can never leave you.</strong></p>

<p>As a conscious entity you are your own Alpha and Omega. When the money is gone you still have to answer to yourself. Your paradigm is inherently local to self, even if the experiences that form it are shared by others in some way. You cannot act beyond the scope of the knowledge you have. You cannot perceive beyond the scope of your paradigm because it will color your every interpretation of the knowledge you obtain. You will not make decisions for the sake of others because your only awareness of another is through the knowledge you&#39;ve obtained about them. The very act of taking the action depends upon your decision that this action satisfies you in some way. That alone is ultimately what will drive you to make the decision.</p>

<p>Just because money itself has no value to you doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re acting altruistically. It means that the relationship has more value to you than the money does in that situation. Let&#39;s change the situation:</p>

<p>Would you rather prevent Hitler from being born or save the life of a family member?</p>

<p>I already know the answer to this question from seeing how passionate you are about your friends and family. Truthfully, I&#39;d choose family as well. Most anyone who doesn&#39;t hate their would and that&#39;s my point.</p>

<p>Yes, but why does this diminish ones acts?  This is simply a position in society one has and at some point one should probably recognize that they &#39;have enough/have their fair share&#39; and should focus on other more important aspects of life, or different kinds of wealth.  A truly greedy person, or sociopath, would simply continue to take more than their fair share and not return anything to the community.  I think you are confusing what is required to survive and what is too much.  Consider that NOTHING in the world can survive without taking (or receiving) SOMETHING.  At the most basic level each entity <em>must</em> kill and eat other beings to survive, but does that mean I should kill and eat more than is required and deprive others?</p>

<p>Orcaecca is stating that, in their case, they agree with this. That they had enough money, having no material concerns, and that the meaning of wealth became the pursuit of relationships. As long as a person is in a situation where money in itself offers no inherent value as a pursuit, this will generally be the case. All your needs are cared for and you can pursue your wants.</p>

<p>I was not suggesting that excessive greed is a good thing, nor was I absolutely defining the selfish nature of human decisions as inherently greedy with respect to money. The act of selfish interest inherent to others is one of perceived value to self, which is not inherently money. It&#39;s just often money because few of us have enough of it for the value of it to depreciate.</p>

<p>The specific case of monetary greed often emerges in individuals (so far as first generation is concerned) are inherently frugal. Their monetary gain is shrewdly spent in contrast to how aggressively it is amassed. An excellent example of this is Warren Buffet who scarcely utilizes the sheer fortune he owns.</p>

<p>The emergence of monetary greed as phenomenon is a property of self worth associated directly to monetary worth. That is, the value of self is whatever the net worth of self is. This idealization of self worth has no satisfactory number of &#39;enough&#39;. Not because one is incapable of reaching that point but instead because for some that point doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>Most second generation and on members of wealthy families will not trend in this manner. It is a common thing to see those who are born into a life which places no meaning or value to money to spend it recklessly and ignore preparing to control the estate. They just live it up as they see fit. In the cases where this isn&#39;t true you often have generational prodigal preparations with goals transcending present status. I find the Rothchilds of 17th century France to be an excellent example of this, as they expanded a modest banking empire into one of unmatched supremacy through careful strategy with family members. </p>

<p>That said, the nature of inherently selfish behavior of individuals isn&#39;t a statement of diminished merit. Much of society categorizes and labels the selfish nature of our paradigm to be unjust, even though this is in conflict with our most basic form of reasoning as living beings. This in itself isn&#39;t a product of a few individuals showing us that we are capable of being interested in the well being of others. Quite the opposite, actually. The major emphasis on sequestering the self from the pursuit of wealth emerges with the core religions emergent at the height of Rome.</p>

<p><em>&quot;I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.&quot;</em></p>

<p>The foundational premise of this begins with the &#39;selfless giving&#39; to the institution preaching the idea. History goes on to document that the use of these &#39;selfless donations&#39; was anything but altruistic, nor the lives of the members lead in the humble manner of which they preached. It was an exceptionally well crafted act of greed that became especially effective. This only worked because the value of money was exchanged with the value of another desirable thing. In this case it was heaven, described as an eternal paradise as a reward.</p>

<p>The point I am eluding to is that there are no more altruistic acts than their are truly holy men. We should not despair on that fact, though. We should acknowledge that we are motivated by the self and that the nature of our decisions is always reflecting self interest. Teaching someone not to be monetarily greedy is as easy as teaching them fulfillment by other means. However, the teaching is exactly as effective as the person is able to act to obtain fulfillment in this manner, weighed against when they are forced to act contrary to it.</p>

<p>You cannot ask a gazelle to be at peace as it walks among tigers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, sometimes I just wanted to be wrong about these things, truthfully. I hated the idea that I lived in a world where it was the reality. Sometimes I liked to pretend I was wrong and humor others in a way that I&#39;d humor myself. It can be terribly disappointing to be right about these kinds of things.</p>

<p>What bothers me though...this isn&#39;t the worst of it. There are a handful of things significant worse than what&#39;s come to light so far. Two of them aren&#39;t hard to see but they&#39;re monstrous. One of them... I don&#39;t know if I want to be around if that event happens. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are others who feel the same way and that we all have different events we feel that way about. Ultimately what it comes down to is being observant of cause and effect. That&#39;s all many of us are. We see an event and we immediately consider the motivations, capabilities, gains, risks and reactions. It&#39;s not a matter of assuming conspiracy as the norm. That&#39;s just the simplest approximation given the variables concerned. I&#39;ll grant that some of us are better at it than others.</p>

<p>Having said that, I&#39;ve observed my government do a lot of stupid things. Not in the sense that they made power grabs or that they&#39;re instituted mass surveillance. Those were all very natural things that they did. The stupidity involves the blunders that resulted their actions in being so obvious. These aren&#39;t mistakes you expect to see intelligent organizations making in the way that they do... but the fact is that they do. All larger organizations now and in the future will have similar stumbling blocks.</p>

<p>What troubles me is not these organizations. They annoy me on a regular basis but in the grand scheme of things, eh. It doesn&#39;t really mean much to me as an individual when they lie to me because I know they&#39;re lying. What does trouble me is when they act in silence from something that has nothing of apparent interest in the scope of what their actions are.</p>

<p>I want to know why NOAA has a G1 rating after an R3 event in the middle of an anomalous solar flare-up where another X2 just launched and a CME is about to trigger a geomagnetic storm. I want to know why the CDC recently purchased a very high quantity of medicine used to treat radiation sickness and the materials necessary to build tent cities. I want to believe the massive grid failure drill for the east coast in two weeks is entirely preventative but a part of me is very concerned with the correlation. The timing of the four floating wave powered data centers suddenly being built in total secrecy and a rush doesn&#39;t do anything to alleviate this.</p>

<p>I expect my government to lie to me. Historically, they&#39;ve lied to me for the cost of telling the lie. It worries me when they put their money where their asshole (re:mouth) is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good observation on those secret(ive) floating data centers.</p>

<p>And yes there is a lot of...shall we say...<em>circumstantial</em> evidence that Very Bad Things are to come.</p>

<p>There are at least three ways to look at it. (One of these will get you &quot;downvoted&quot;. The other two are acceptable.)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It fits in with Biblical prophecy. God is in control, ultimately, but this is actually Satan&#39;s world at the moment. The New World Order is his version of the perfect world. The surveillance/police state is the result of his usage of technology to imitate the characteristics of the God he wants to usurp. The coming slaughter of most of the world&#39;s population (through wars, evil uses of technology, and manipulation of nature) is his way of destroying God&#39;s image. (Or something like that.) But for those who know the Truth, there is hope. It&#39;s a <em>temporary</em> system - and will be defeated and done away with. The Beast looks like he&#39;s going to win but his time will be short-lived and end in defeat. God <em>is</em> just and <em>will</em> set things right. The days are evil, persecution and suffering will happen, but there is light on the other side of the coming Tribulation.</p></li>
<li><p>We can overcome the New World Order! With our vast network of freedom-warrior connections on the internet, libertarian values, and the occasional bumper sticker on our car/fixed-gear bike, we will spread truth and awareness. The sheeple will wake up, the powers that be will be denied their power through our actions (somehow or other), and the New World Order will fall to its knees - powerless against the march of truth warriors. (Or something like that.) Sort of like what you hear on the Alex Jones show. The future is ours! [INSERT CURRENT YEAR] is the new 1776! <del>Ron</del> Rand Paul/Ted Cruz/somebody will turn it around!</p></li>
<li><p>We can do nothing, there is no God, and we are very likely doomed unless we can somehow survive the coming onslaught by bugging in, or bugging out, and always laying low. Might as well look for a good hovel to live in <em>now</em>: before the welfare riots commence, DHS shoots most of us and bulldozes us into mass graves, and rounds up the survivors for internment into FEMA camps. The collapse of the Almighty Dollar is coming, and without a supply of strong Federal Reserve Notes in our hands we have nothing. Accept your fate, wage slaves: the world is changing and it ain&#39;t getting better for <em>you</em>. Remember that some animals are more equal than others. 1984 arrived a few years too late, but a Brave New World is better late than never. Just be thankful that you have a nice pair of sunglasses on <em>now</em> so you can see it coming. And <strong>Spoiler Alert</strong>: Soylent Green is people. Just try to survive. And try to get your kids to the other good guys eventually.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>(Sorry I couldn&#39;t <em>also</em> fit references to <strong>Blade Runner</strong>, <strong>THX1138</strong>, <strong>Minority Report</strong>, <strong>The Book of Eli</strong>, <strong>Logan&#39;s Run</strong>, and <strong>The Hunger Games</strong> into #3 above. But I sure wanted to.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So are you saying that on June 4, 1963 Kennedy <strong>didn&#39;t</strong> sign Executive Order No. 11110 that returned to the U.S. government the power to issue currency, without going through the Federal Reserve? Because, if I remember correctly, he signed it...it was repealed when Ronald Reagan issued Executive Order 12608 on September 9, 1987.</p>

<p>It seems to me that YOUR research is what&#39;s deficient here, not everyone else&#39;s.</p>

<p>And Sandy Hook--I&#39;m not even going to get into that there are SO many inconsistencies. Please show me ONE picture of Adam Lanza holding a gun in that school--or hell, even the video of him being buzzed into the school--or the damage to the door frame if he busted his way in. There&#39;s a reason that it doesn&#39;t exist. For me (and millions of other people) that &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; would instantly be derailed if only ONE frame of the video from SH&#39;s &quot;new, state-of-the-art&quot; security system was shown to the public. But, like the &quot;plane&quot; hitting the Pentagon--this image will never see the light of day--likely because it <em>simply doesn&#39;t exist</em>.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not hear about &quot;wanting to see pix of dead kids&quot; because that&#39;s not it at all. I don&#39;t want to see that. But consider this: When Columbine happened that camera footage was on the news THAT VERY NIGHT. Dead kids were being carried out in view of the public. Parents didn&#39;t ID their kids with a CCTV system. What&#39;s different about Sandy Hook? I don&#39;t remember seeing one, let alone two, parents of dead Columbine kids smiling and laughing before &quot;composing themselves&quot; with grief before they though the cameras were rolling, come to think of it...did you?</p>

<p>Perhaps you don&#39;t research <em>enough?</em> Is that it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, JFK signed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11110">Executive Order 11110</a>. It was part of his plan to <em>stop producing</em> silver certificates and replace them with Federal Reserve notes. This is a great example of why people need to get their facts straight and not just get stuff off of random Internet sites. Lots of the sites have the facts <em>backwards</em> from what was actually going on.</p>

<p>Kennedy <a href="http://archive.org/stream/EconomicReportOfThePresidentJanuary1963#page/n22/mode/1up">asked Congress in January 1963 for new law</a> (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I again urge a revision in our silver policy to reflect the status of silver as a metal for which there is an expanding industrial demand. Except for its use in coins, <strong>silver serves no useful monetary function.</strong></p>

<p>In 1961, at my direction, sales of silver were suspended by the Secretary of the Treasury. As further steps, I recommend repeal of those Acts that oblige the Treasury to support the price of silver; and repeal of the special 50-percent tax on transfers of interest in silver and <strong>authorization for the Federal Reserve System to issue notes in denominations of $1, so as to make possible the gradual withdrawal of silver certificates from circulation</strong> and the use of the silver thus released for coinage purposes. I urge the Congress to take prompt action on these recommended changes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Congress passed the law and Kennedy signed it on June 4, 1963. He signed the executive order the same day because <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/UnitedStatesStatutesAtLargeVolume77_1963/UnitedStatesStatutesAtLargeVolume77#page/n80/mode/1up">the new law</a> removed the Treasury Secretary&#39;s power to print silver certificates by his own authorization. To allow the continued printing while the Federal Reserve notes were being readied, Kennedy signed the order, which delegated the president&#39;s authority under a different law.</p>

<p>G. Edward Griffin, author of the anti-Fed book, <em>The Creature from Jekyll Island</em>, also rejects the theory that Executive Order 11110 had anything to do with Kennedy&#39;s assassination. See his article, <a href="http://www.freedomforceinternational.org/freedomcontent.cfm?fuseaction=jfkmyth">&quot;The JFK Myth&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a newspaper article from the time:</p>

<p><a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=60BYAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;sjid=d_cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;amp;pg=4270,1590553">&quot;Kennedy Signs Silver Bill&quot;</a><br/>
<em>Spokane Daily Chronicle</em>, June 6, 1963, p. 34</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Colorado Springs, Colo. (AP) — President Kennedy announced yesterday President Kennedy announced yesterday the signing of a bill permitting the gradual melting down of silver bullion reserve for use in making coins.</p>

<p>The measure was signed Tuesday but the announcement was delayed until Kennedy reached this silver producing state on the first leg of a five-day, five-state western trip.</p>

<p>Under the new law, pushed by the administration, the Treasury will be able to retire silver certificates paper money now backed by silver bullion as the bullion is melted down for coinage. The silver certificates would be replaced by federal reserve notes.</p>

<p>The new law also would permit eventual melting down of silver dollars for use in coins of smaller denominations.</p>

<p>In addition to signing the administration bill, Kennedy issued an executive order permitting the Treasury to continue use of silver certificates for as long as necessary.</p>

<p>This is one of the main issues with this sub. Many of the members here just assume they know better than others just because they read an idea or theory in an article online. People will post articles or self threads, it gets like 41/7 upvotes, and then common sense or research shows it&#39;s a bullshit source or just fear mongering hear say. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying this is true for all posts on this sub, but certainly many. I believe (or wish) that if you feel strongly enough about something to make a post about it, you would have done your research and wouldn&#39;t mind sharing it with others. As opposed to someone asking for other pieces of evidence, another source, etc., and then receiving attacks, downvotes, or just no reply at all.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure we all know, just because something is on the Internet doesn&#39;t make it true. And by that I mean YouTube videos or blogs or other web sites that report on stuff or &quot;have heard rumblings and rumors&quot; but offer no real evidence. </p>

<p>I&#39;m all for having our own opinions, but clarity, reasoning, and facts sure go along way in helping one understand where the other is coming from. </p>

I wouldn&#39;t do what he did. I don&#39;t have the balls. </p>

<p>...but here we have a chance to define ourselves as a nation going forward. That&#39;s awesome. It&#39;s upon the US geeks to get the word out about how internet architecture works and why it is that the NSA holds all the cards. Unless you can compel your politicians to take action, nothing will happen. Personally, do I care that the NSA has access to all of my site info, passwords, etc? Nope. I know some of those guys. They don&#39;t care what I do... the NSA employees are generally patriots. ...but are they also idiots? Some of the bureaucrats in charge are. There are constitutional protections being side stepped here and now is the time to reign them in. We have the American public and indeed the world&#39;s attention now. If we don&#39;t do something about this soon it&#39;s going to be bad for America, bad for the world, and bad for the internet as a whole. That&#39;s how I feel about it anyway...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has happened to me on this SR more times than I can count.</p>

<p>People LOVE to belittle me and tell me my ideas are shit...but I am still batting nearly 1000 with my information.</p>

<p>You watch and see--when, say, Agent Jones&#39; affiliation with CIA and Stratfor/Big Zion are finally reported by the mainstream news everybody&#39;s gonna say &quot;...oh, I KNEW that guy was a shill!&quot;--and it will be the same people, <em>guaranteed</em>, that spend time today defending this fat COINTELPRO blowhard who has basically been the Rush Limbaugh of the &quot;conspiracy movement&quot; by making &quot;us&quot; all look like loud-mouthed fools. What happened to those &quot;ICBMs incoming from Russia RIGHT NOW!!!&quot; eh Alex? (December 31, 1999) Bill Cooper was right--he is a &quot;bullshit artist&quot;--and a good one at that.</p>

<p>It won&#39;t be long now--he slipped up BADLY in 2012 with the Stratfor incident--so badly that he released FALSE STORIES to confuse the search engines AND cancelled a national speaking tour. Basically, his loyal shills were the ONLY thing that kept him from fleeing to Israel (where he can be, and probably already is, a legal citizen thanks to his wife).</p>

<p>Just like when he &quot;infiltrated&quot; Bohemian Grove when, in actuality, he was there as a guest of his Zionist boss Jeffrey R. Smulyan (CEO of Emmis &quot;Hebrew for &#39;truth&quot; Communications) and is even later chastised in public by a guy for &quot;betraying the agreement he made&quot; with the Grove (somebody found this for me once--it&#39;s on YouTube).</p>

<p>It&#39;s all good though. I don&#39;t even bother arguing with people like that anymore. I just wait for the shit to hit the fan--it always does--and laugh to myself...again.</p>

<p>For this SR being a &quot;thinking ground&quot; there sure are a LOT of people that buy into the OBVIOUS false flag attacks (Boston, Sandy Hook, even 9/11) and attack you for trying to get at the truth. It&#39;s both disgusting and really, really sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I see, i&#39;m surrounded by a bunch of insane people. And by insane, I literally mean, lost their mind.. as in they don&#39;t own it.</p>

<p>People, like you (and hopefully me), are able to foresee what the implications of a certain actions would entail. We don&#39;t close our minds and live in a world of hope and dreams. We live in reality and accept things for what they are and what they really mean. Not what we wish they meant. </p>

<p>And I won&#39;t be surprised one bit when Jones is exposed for the fraud that he is. I can&#39;t believe people on this subreddit defend that guy. I&#39;ve been trying to get infowars banned from the front page for a long time. Not banned in total, just from the front to protect the image.</p>

<p>Even more so, I think we are going to see a campaign of exposing corruption all over the world around the same time as the global economic crash, and war in the middle east. The masses will be exposed to the corruption by a certain campaign set up to give positive favor and image to a certain leader. A leader that will step in during this time of crisis/corruption/chaos and have lots of credibility with almost the entire world. This man will lead the one world govt being set up by agenda 21. Idk how long this will take, but I&#39;m thinking a few more epic things have to happen first. Ison is definitely going to be something to look.</p>

Other than that, the answer to your heading is yes. People thought I was legitimately insane when I talked about the fact that everyone&#39;s phone was tapped, back in January 2012.

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree. No one is paying us to inform people about these things. So when we do it, don&#39;t push for sources, especially when these things are easily available. </p>

<p>I have had to repeat the same things many times and source it each time. It&#39;s just a pain. </p>

<p>Of course there are many of us that don&#39;t make outlandish claims and don&#39;t back them with facts ever because they are merely opinions. Those people need to stick to facts because their claims could hurt the whole idea of spreading good information. </p>

<p>In other words, when we discuss something basic about politics, that&#39;s perhaps not the time to mention about the reptilian overlords. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you can always pose the question &quot;would the government lie to me?&quot; and the answer is yes. Its compulsively lies.   Its a bureaucracy, one which is not culpable in the majority of perjury cases. Gov. will tell you acceptable lies, over honesty, in almost every situation posed to it...
You start to see that there is no justice in a dishonest system.  And that &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; are just words to spin-doctored.   </p>

<p>We approve people to represent us, but we never seem to approve of their actions or reasons. Would big corporate interests assassinate a president? Yes. Would they crash planes and blow up the world trade center? Yes.  Would they admit to it?  Never.  </p>

<p>To them it spells political suicide and would be the end of their power trip.  Gov. resorts to self preservation of its own ideals. That is, the self preservation of an oligarchy where the rich hold all the power.  These weasels justify themselves, acting like their lies are harmless. And that justice is only served against their enemies, The people of United States of America.</p>
