        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My understanding of the globalist agenda has morphed, shifted, and grown over many years of independent research, and this is my conclusion of their goals as of now.  It&#39;s a multigenerational plan born under genius psychopaths with unlimited wealth and influence, being implemented softly and slowly under many guises: national security, cyber-security, protecting the children, public education, health &quot;rights&quot;, economic growth, environmental protection, etc.  It&#39;s always rolled out like they&#39;re helping make things better.  Like an iceberg we can only see a small part of the disaster that lies ahead and from our viewpoint it&#39;s not directly an imminent threat unless you have some idea of what lies beneath.  Just like achieving any goal it can&#39;t be done overnight in one broad stroke, tiny things add up over time to become a mountain of accomplishments.  In my opinion the idea is to permanently separate the ruling class from us, in 50-100 years if all goes uninterrupted they will have created a 1% superclass and will control all aspects of every moment of the other 99%&#39;s lives.  Only approved food, medicine, schooling, jobs, infrastructure, philosophy, religion, etc. will be provided by this 1%.  All of this is only to buy time until the technology has reached a point where security can be provided and resources can be gathered, processed, and distributed without the need for humans.  Once the machines are in place then the bioweapon will be released to &quot;thin the herd&quot;, and the super class lives happily ever after eventually merging with the machines and becoming transhumans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m no longer concerned by these types of thoughts anymore.  Any human attempting to have absolute control of 99% of any organic object, including humans, somewhere down the line is going to be thrown against the wall by the short and curlys.  I&#39;m aware attempts will be made anyway, but have comfort in knowing with certainty that it will never last or even work exactly as intended.  Efforts like these are eventually overthrown and cycles of good times and bad will never end.  Knowing that cycles never stop, the best thing to do in the meantime is to enjoy your life.  Do whatever you please (in the context of the golden rule) regardless of who you suspect may be watching or taking notes.  Take your life back and anyone in the way of this plan can be let known to kiss your ass.  If an entity like the NSA or something wants to spy on me while I&#39;m having a great time, let those sorry bitches drink it up.  I&#39;m not looking back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I have to respond to this example:  the more control that was attempted and the worse the cows conditions got, resulted directly with the cows backfiring on their controllers with mad cow disease, forcing better conditions and improved diet and mandatory distribution of vitamins, etc.            </p>

<p>And yes, to the question about cows <em>literally</em> touching their short and curly&#39;s, there was a photo yesterday on /wtf of a bull ramming its horn straight into short and curly&#39;s of a bullfighter (bull controller) in a very gruesome way.  Controlling will work periodically, but there is always the moment where the controllers get thrown against the wall and decapitated, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well its pretty deep when you think about it.  As long as enough comfort is provided, there aren&#39;t complaints.  So the farmers have got to the point where they <em>must</em> provide a certain level of comfort, and quality of food &amp; vitamins.  They must provide shelter from the storm, warmth in the winter, and fresh food every morning.  The farmers are the cows bitch until the cow gets harvested in adulthood.  Each side has something the other wants so an equilibrium is reached.  There are also human tax farms, and always will be.  However, if the comfort of living is so good that there isn&#39;t anything to complain about, you&#39;ll find you can enjoy yourself in the present.  But back to the OP, if they try to go all nutty and reduce population in droves, cut back everything, etc, the humans will bite back, they always do, and the controllers will be thrown against the wall again until a new equilibrium is reached.  The point is, you can get all fucking crazy over every new days details, or you can enjoy yourself for once, if while enjoying yourself things get nutty in your personal life, you&#39;ll know its time to throw people against the wall again, until then, live a little.</p>

<p>What you say is true except for this one bit.</p>

<p>The cycle happens because people help turn the wheel. telling people to sit back and not worry about it is the equivalent of taking your hand off the wheel and relinquishing any power of its turning. 1 good person is much stronger than 1 person looking to do harm, but there are far more &quot;bad&quot; than &quot;good&quot;</p>

<p>good doesnt win just because we have a figmental concept of good. good wins because people fight in support of it, just like these psychopaths fight in support of their &quot;evil&quot; agenda.</p>

If you don&#39;t take your hand off the wheel, you&#39;re going to end up driving down a shitty road, missing the point entirely without enjoying the good things that have already been successfully fought for.  In other words, you&#39;ll miss the point of all your freedom battles.  Someone is always going to want to control the world, and it will always fail and fly to pieces.  Just relax already, step out of the rat wheel and take note of the pointlessness of the wheel.  Find something that makes you happy, even watch dogs need a break from being on guard duty.</p>

I mean look at how advanced the technology for the spying is, which very few people probably knew about besides those who were in on it.

    <div class="md"><p>Assume the worst case scenario - global hegemony run by a sociopathic authoritarian dictator.</p>

<p>What&#39;s likely to happen, given historical precedent, psychology, and various patterns of nature?</p>

<p>One guy eventually tells his so-called Übermenschen or whatever that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STALIN#Purges_and_deportations">they can all be replaced</a>, after giving them token privileges or legal immunity for a short while.</p>

<p>He has his useful idiots &quot;replace&quot; his loyal close followers (heading that direction already), and replaces them with other cute puppets. What follows that? Assume an indefinite authoritarian state.</p>

<p>What effect does this have? Environmental destruction that comes along with all planned societies (&quot;... if the Sahara desert ever becomes a communist regime, in one year there will be a shortage of sand!&quot;) - due to the inherent inefficiency of slave labor, and the eventual realization (assuming unnaturally long life span of dictator and entrenched regime) by the dictator that he is living in a figurative mirrored ball, staring at the reflection of his own ego, with no way out. Given his paranoia that came along with his grandiose notions of himself, chances are he would not even have death as an escape and would be totally dependent on the very slaves that he created to end his misery. However, those slaves, even if they were not conditioned to prevent his death at any cost, would be reliant on his truly willing to be dead to end him.</p>

<p>They say look before you leap, dear Dictator. You&#39;ll save yourself some time, and everyone else some suffering, if you just do yourself in <em>while you can</em>. It&#39;s more efficient that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re stuck inside a box that you haven&#39;t broken out of yet.

<p>Yes, power corrupts. Over time power has corrupted even the most benevolent of purposes. Therefore, most benevolent practices are eventually corrupted and used by manipulative forces to achieve alternative goals that benefit the few rather than the many.

<p>I&#39;m not saying that there aren&#39;t forces out there who have conspired over long periods of time to consolidate power to themselves, rather I&#39;m saying that all of the dots don&#39;t simply connect to create this perfect conspiracy you are describing here.

However, that doesn&#39;t mean that there aren&#39;t plenty of people involved in this conspiracy community who are too caught up in this and are unable to differentiate between reality and fantasy. I&#39;ve seen it plenty of times in the comments, there is a lot of arrogance and disillusion coming from these types of individuals and it makes open conversation difficult, and it also takes away from the legitimacy of the community and the topics we discuss here.

    <div class="md"><p>Blah blah blah blah blah - <strong>who do you think these &quot;conspirators&quot; are exactly? THEY ARE JUST LIKE YOU, HUMAN BEINGS ON PLANET EARTH</strong> - they ARE &quot;the people&quot;, they ARE &quot;the herd&quot;, they ARE &quot;humans&quot;. If they can manage humanity so well, then <em>they deserve to</em>. If they can manage a truly global evolution of societies and civilization, then <em>they are the right people from among us to bring our species into the next phase</em> of our evolution. Whether you LIKE IT or not is irrelevant to what is actually going to happen.</p>

<p>We are a life form going through a natural process of evolution from stupid/unevolved cavemen with primitive tools to a global society. We aren&#39;t in charge of most things, and we certainly aren&#39;t in charge of EVERYthing - the universe and nature itself has certain set paths of opportunity for evolution, it has a &quot;plan&quot; for all it&#39;s &quot;parts&quot;, we(human beings on planet Earth) are one of those &quot;parts&quot;. Sometimes we forget that and think that, within our small little lives, WE are in charge - in reality, we aren&#39;t in charge of much more than our immediate choices.</p>

<p>The universe is a self-sustaining/self-guiding system that we are inside of, the Earth will take care of itself, if we are too detrimental to it we will destroy ourselves and it will start over and give life another chance to successfully take hold - this is the story of every species. Right now we are at a point where we will either wake up and take responsibility for ourselves after hundreds/thousands of years of meaningless/needless warfare and devotion to petty service to self - OR - our civilization will reach the pinnacle of it&#39;s development(which you call &quot;globalization&quot;, a truly global civilization) and fall back down to where it came from, and life will try again. This is how nature works, it&#39;s not about individual &quot;conspirators&quot; or conspiracies or about YOUR WANTS or ideals, all of those are small things taking part in a larger, more natural thing. The process is the evolution of life.</p>

<p>Things work out or they don&#39;t NATURALLY - if we didn&#39;t have the psychopaths vying for power and fighting each other/organizing armies/pulling together societies behind causes(real or invented) - we wouldn&#39;t have moved from primitive tribal communities living out their primitive lives to a massive space-exploring planetary society, which is where we are going now. Maybe nature uses them to create progress, and eventually it&#39;s up to us(the rest of the people) to take responsibility for ourselves and our own cultural direction. Or MAYBE we&#39;re(the &quot;herd&quot;) too wasteful and worthless to ever actually do that, and it will be necessary for &quot;the elite&quot; to keep going and take over, eventually having a lesser need of useless eaters and depopulating the Earth / creating a utopia for themselves and their children / repopulating it with only wisely-guided breeding and with their own children, and their children&#39;s childen, etc. and so on. That would probably be fine too. The biggest point is to not destroy our resources and environment so that life can go on even if we(our current civilization) don&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that was just amazing. [6] But on a timeline of their will you truly are correct. What more could they ever want? </p>

<p>However to play the devil&#39;s advocate a bit - would the future of <strong>humanity in general</strong> not be assured with such a plan? I could agree that we would sustain perpetually and more efficiently with a smaller, more like-minded population. It would just take some criminally insane group of individuals (<em>aka supervillians</em>) without traces of morality to enact such a terrible plan. I like to throw in the idea that the elite are more for perpetuating a <em>correct</em> idea of humanity and observing how people react. </p>

And while the Great Pyramid stood as the tallest structure for almost 4000 years, that does not mean that the Egyptians were friends with aliens; it only means that no culture rivaled the Egyptians at building monuments until the 19th century. </p>
