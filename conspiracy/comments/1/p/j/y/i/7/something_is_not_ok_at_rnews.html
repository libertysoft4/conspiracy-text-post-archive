Also, the massive upvoting of posts glorifying Monsanto, declaring GMOs as &quot;safe&quot; and same as selective cross-breeding, which is false, is overwhelming.  This sudden influx of corporatism and blatant calls of curtailing consumer information rights is very new to <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>.  After <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>&#39; manufactured descent into the rightwing arena, we may be witnessing a trend spanning multiple popular subreddits.

<p>there are ways to create unsafe foods using GMO technology.</p>

<p>it is a TOOL. it may be used for great good or great evil.</p>

<p>do not denigrate a TOOL. denigrate poor uses of it.</p>

<p>edit: this whole situation is a perfect example of how well meaning causes (information about food and how it is prepared and grown) gets subverted into completely ineffective &quot;solutions.&quot; people hate monsanto and people want more information about GMO. this is a good thing. i agree. but all of these people are supporting a &quot;solution&quot; which is completely irrelevant to those concerns! putting a sticker or label on food that says it is GMO and nothing more detailed (which is what is proposed by the labeling initiative) doesn&#39;t solve the problems. in fact, it would serve to reduce information about GMO and their effectiveness! if either of those groups want to truly achieve their desires, they would work towards revoking Monsanto&#39;s corporate charter and work to increase detailed information on health and nutritional labels. however, currently both groups are being lulled into thinking they are helping by supporting GMO labeling.</p>

<p>in the 20 years since GMO crops first came on the market, studies have found that they have led to higher pesticide use, and no meaningful improvement in flavor, nutrition, yield or water requirements. Instead, what they&#39;ve created are plants that are engineered to withstand massive dosing of toxic herbicides, and plants that function as living pesticide factories. Monsanto&#39;s Bt. corn, for example, is actually registered with the EPA as a pesticide.</p>

<p>this proves you do not know ANYTHING about GMO. </p>

<p>we are hardly the first generation to eat them. and they are in a wide array of food products already.</p>

<p>and you also do not know how to read if you think i am advocating not putting detailed information about them on nutrition labels. </p>

<p>but, simply putting a large sticker on a box that says GMO is completely unhelpful and adds no information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol i&#39;m not offended. i am just pointing out that your position is one of ignorance. you state over and over you are uninterested in even learning more about them and just &#39;don&#39;t want them.&#39;</p>

<p>it offends me not that you are dumb, but that people like you are advocating something which will increase ignorance for many millions of people who may not have the same attitudes as you. it is fascism.</p>

<p>the solution is not to say things are GMO or not. the solution is to add a section to the nutritonal label which details genetic alteration within any substances used in the preparation and growing of the food.</p>

<p>then, you can look at the back and if there are things listed (even when they will eventually say &quot;genes added to increase visual acuity&quot; or something else beneficial) simply refuse to read on and make your ignorant decision to not buy the product.</p>

<p>don&#39;t kid yourself into thinking that all GMO would be labeled anyways. read up on how the FDA and USDA does its due diligence (hint, they don&#39;t really). </p>

<p>my solution and ideas keep us all much more informed and intelligent than your line of ignorant thought.</p>

<p>the only thing labeling food as GMO will accomplish is that some of the food will be labeled which has GMO and some WONT (any company with enough money to lobby congress and get themselves exemption from the labeling laws, which WILL happen)</p>

<p>Labeling controversial products as such gives consumers a measure of choice - they can vote with their dollars.

<p>Because by manipulating genes, we are fucking with the very core of living organisms. It is not the same as selective breeding or hybridization - and no one can foresee unintended consequences - not just to human health, but to the environment at large</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/04/business/energy-environment/04weed.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0">New York Times:</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just as the heavy use of antibiotics contributed to the rise of drug-resistant supergerms, American farmers’ near-ubiquitous use of the weedkiller Roundup has led to the rapid growth of tenacious new superweeds.</p>

<p>To fight them, Mr. Anderson and farmers throughout the East, Midwest and South are being forced to spray fields with more toxic herbicides, pull weeds by hand and return to more labor-intensive methods like regular plowing.</p>

<p>“We’re back to where we were 20 years ago,” said Mr. Anderson, who will plow about one-third of his 3,000 acres of soybean fields this spring, more than he has in years. “We’re trying to find out what works.”</p>

<p>Farm experts say that such efforts could lead to higher food prices, lower crop yields, rising farm costs and more pollution of land and water.</p>

<p>“It is the single largest threat to production agriculture that we have ever seen,” said Andrew Wargo III, the president of the Arkansas Association of Conservation Districts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you think Monsanto INTENDED to create <strong>Super Pigweed</strong>?</p>

<p>Crops cross-pollinate. Animals (like salmon) that are SUPPOSED to be sterile become fertile - get loose, and can change whole species, affecting their predators and their prey.</p>

<p>Ever heard of &quot;Killer Bees&quot;? No, that wasn&#39;t a GMO experiment, but like rats and cats being introduced to isolated islands, unintended consequences can be devastating.</p>

<p>With GMOs, the potential for irreversible damage is mind boggling, and no, I do NOT trust monopolistic mega-corporations or the little politicians and bureaucrats that they keep tucked comfortably in their pockets with that kind of power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh you&#39;re right, it creates a choice...</p>

<p>people against certain GMOs will be way less likely to actually learn the differences in others offered and instead choose to remain ignorant of the benefits offered because they see a label that says &quot;GMO&quot; and to them that means bad.</p>

<p>combined with how we teach everyone to think in this country, (black box thought, input always gives same output for very generalized functions) we would worsen willful ignorance by a large factor. </p>

<p>labeling something GMO does nothing other than tell someone &quot;do not bother looking into any specifics about how this food was grown, harvested, or prepared or consider any potential benefits which may be offered by its genetic alteration. instead, file this under the same category with every other GMO in your brain.&quot;</p>

<p>whether for each person that means GOOD or BAD is completely arbitrary. but, it certainly increases and encourages ignorance.</p>

<p>that is what is being attempted with the GMO labeling initiatives.</p>

<p>Sorry but it just doesn&#39;t make sense.
Here is your logical problem.  </p>

<p>Despite your perceptions of ignorance of the masses, people will use information, especially when they have had some education about a subject.  There hasn&#39;t been much education about GMO because it&#39;s still a relatively new concept in it&#39;s modern incarnation.</p>

Many people still think it&#39;s unreasonable to suggest the US would restrict content critical of its behaviour but we already have examples. China has it&#39;s own firewall, Iran restricts social media, Turkey took stuff down in the protests and the list goes on, including how hard drives were destroyed at the Guardian or how journalists homes in the US were raised to confiscate documents.</p>

<p>It&#39;s already happening and it&#39;s been happening for a while.

    <div class="md"><p>Yup.  GMO&#39;s and Monsanto business policies are perhaps the most heavily shilled topics on Reddit, along with fracking.  In case you guys don&#39;t know, the sub <a href="/r/GMOmyths">/r/GMOmyths</a> is a voting brigade sub through which many GMO shill accounts organize.  <a href="/u/JF_Queeny">/u/JF_Queeny</a>, <a href="/u/firemylasers">/u/firemylasers</a>, and <a href="/u/scuderia">/u/scuderia</a> along with many other accounts organize their thread voting/spamming from this sub.  There was previously a list of 20 or so usernames associated with the sub floating around Reddit but the admins started threatening anyone who posted it with permanent site wide bans.  </p>
