    <div class="md"><p>Eh i guess not. But still. They have usually been at least a little more sneaky when going about things, leaving only a little bit of info for some conspirators to notice to squash opposing views by labelling them as crazies. They skeet for plausible deniability. So im looking for a scenario that will give them plausible deniability, but will raise questions amongst us who are skeptical. A plane being shot down or somehow crashes is too incriminalizing for me. </p>

<p>When someone performs a sleight of hand trick, you have to watch the other hand. What im saying, is that most conspiracy theorists are going to be watching this plane like hawks. Instead, im looking for the other hand, like those who are staying behind to maybe vote on a bill such as the UN Small Arms Treaty ratification... </p>

<p>For instance, get most of congress out of dc, leaving a few members behind to vote to ratify the UN Small Arms Treaty by means of a two thirds majority vote of those present, while everyone is paying attention to the planes carrying the opposing members of congress. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or maybe its split up by those who are for a certain legislation and those against, say the UN Small Arms Treaty. Or maybe some are staying in dc for a recess vote to ratify the UN SAT by means of majority of those present? Or to give the president fast track authority on the trans-pacific trade treaty? While opposing members are away, they cant vote against them... Obama has been known to do things behind peoples back like this. He likes to get attention of the people focused on one thing so he can hurry and pass something without opposition or attention until its already passed. Its much harder to revoke a passed law than it is to stop it by voting...</p>
