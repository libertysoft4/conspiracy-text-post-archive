He didn&#39;t get into the guts of of it but apparently some of the exercise briefings he&#39;s been privy to have included scenarios for mass armed uprisings FOLLOWING a regional emergency or operation. He didnt say much else other than hes frightened. The guy has been putting people back together over 15 years and ive never known him to be frightened of anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A revolution is going to happen.  Hell, it&#39;s <em>already</em> happening.  It&#39;s just in the process of gaining very slow momentum currently.  It&#39;s already happening though.  It&#39;s already on its way.  It&#39;s already here.</p>

<p>It&#39;s started with the people slowly (<em>very</em> slowly, unfortunately) waking up...bit by bit, one by one.  The more continue waking up, the more a sense of solidarity and togetherness will continue to develop.  The more a sense of solidarity and a feeling of togetherness continue to develop, the more likely it will be that the people will not be afraid to organize, coordinate, and eventually stand up and act.</p>

<p>The revolution is already here.  The tidal wave has already started.  It&#39;s just that - like all tidal waves - you don&#39;t feel the peak crest of the wave immediately.  Initially the only thing you will feel will be a very slight swelling of the waters before you.  That slight swelling is an indication though...that the wave is coming.  Maybe it might not be super close.  Maybe that wave might be far away...but it&#39;s coming.  And often the further away that wave is, the longer it takes to reach its full crest, the more momentum it will have, and the more impact it will have when it finally <em>does</em> land.</p>

<p>Rest assured.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>This is it right here.  The change is in <em>ourselves</em>, and we are all feeling it on one level or another/to some extent or another.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I now know that the entire thing is a spectacle designed to turn your eyes away from the real power...the power to create currency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very well-said.  That power to create currency and hold it over the citizenry&#39;s head depends greatly upon the citizenry&#39;s inability to realize that they (that we) are all part of each other and that we can help one another overcome this manipulation if we but put our differences aside and come together as one.  I realize that we are perhaps nowhere near this understanding as a whole yet, but once it comes and everyone realizes that the true help is not inside our pocket books, but inside our very beings and our ability to help one another <em>independent</em> money, we will begin to grow and prosper as a people on this planet.</p>

<p>This is not pollyanna psycho-babble that I state here.  It is truth.  It may be truth that might seem far away still, but, as I said above, it&#39;s coming and it isn&#39;t <em>too</em> far away.</p>

<p>&quot;WASHINGTON — The electric grid, as government and private experts describe it, is the glass jaw of American industry. If an adversary lands a knockout blow, they fear, it could black out vast areas of the continent for weeks; interrupt supplies of water, gasoline, diesel fuel and fresh food; shut down communications; and create disruptions of a scale that was only hinted at by Hurricane Sandy and the attacks of Sept. 11.</p>

<p>This is why thousands of utility workers, business executives, National Guard officers, F.B.I. antiterrorism experts and officials from government agencies in the United States, Canada and Mexico are preparing for an emergency drill in November that will simulate physical attacks and cyberattacks that could take down large sections of the power grid.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, Italy is corrupt, but it is safer than what was America during a 2nd revolution/civil war. My mane point is simply that I am not going to stick around a die for something that is not worth dying/fighting for. Besides, 
once you become a citizen of an EU state, you have a right to live anywhere in thd EU - so we could easily immigrate to a state with good government, such as Sweden.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion, the EU is worse than the US. Id recommend some research on it. The EU is successful as a form of tyranny where the UN is not. Consistently and increasingly, the EU has been stripping the sovereign rights of its members. Theyre farther down the river than we are. But we still dont have the paddles, so its not like we are in a much better state. Just wait for the North American Union and you will see what i mean. </p>

<p>Point is, america is still the place to be. Id rather fight for freedom here, where there are still millions who understand and value liberty, than to be subject to the state in the EU, where theyve already willingly given up their liberty.</p>

<p>Sure, we are headed down the same path, but we have numbers of likeminded people on our side. The war against tyranny will be won on our land, once again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually have a lot of family and friends over there (im actually a german citizen), and my opinion is obviously biased with their views and my observations. I didnt mean to offend you or anyone, but this is my opinion. My point was that there are more people per capita in america that will stand for freedom than there are in the EU (again, from my personal experiences and observations, coming from the many conversations on this very topic with residents of the EU). Seeing how member states in the EU are more involved with the centralization of power and authority, that is, the EU drafts legislation and asserts said legislation upon its member states, whether or not they want it.</p>

<p>I admit, america is headed down the same path. But like i said, resistance to this kind of centralization of power is greater here than there. Therefore, i choose to believe that america is a better stage in the fight for freedom.</p>
