<p>Please do some research here guys. This is not a fringe conspiracy. John Marco Allegro was a scholar. He was a philologist. He studied language and etymology. He was simply translating the texts he was provided with and was the victim of a character assassination by his colleagues and others because they didn&#39;t like the implications of it.</p>

<p>So what are those implications? How many people have died at the hand of the church? Remember the Crusades? The Inquisition? The Salem Witch Trials? How much money does the Vatican alone bring in? What if people found out they were living a lie?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding the fertility cult thing, yeah, read &quot;two Babylons&quot; by Alexander Hislop for the theory that all major world religions were just expressions of the same mother-religion from a Christian perspective.  Or if you please, you can watch the first half of the movie Zeitgeist for the exact same theory.  Except in the movie, it is an anti-Christian perspective, and they just add Christianity into the equation as more of the same.</p>

<p>In reality, one strain of Christianity did become that shortly after Constantine.  In 300 AD or so, Rome merged all religions into one.  In this &quot;Universal&quot; (Catholic is Latin for the word &quot;Universal&quot;) religion, everybody was accepted no matter what they believed.</p>

<p>You can see evidence for this based on the facts that they stuck a statue of Jupiter in the Vatican and named him Peter, they stuck an Egyptian obelisk in the Vatican, and they hid stone penises inside the altars of all the oldest Catholic churches.  Why do you think there was a Protestant rebellion?</p>

<p>I also personally visited some old Franciscan churches recently and took pictures of lots of icons that demonstrated obvious syncretism.</p>

<p>In reality, there are two world religions.  One that says mankind started out small and slow and simple and dumb but if they gain &quot;knowledge&quot; they can become god because &quot;god&quot; is the sum total of knowledge and power contained within the universe, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFbRH-S2L94&amp;amp;t=0m38s">look for the evolution chart above the chalkboard in this Illuminati sponsored video for a diagram of the religion; pause at 0:43.9</a> Another example of this <em>same</em> religion would be found in Genesis 3:4-5 “You will not certainly die,” the serpent said to the woman. 5 “For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” </p>

<p>And one other religion that says God is completely separate from, and independent of the universe, and the entire universe,and everything in it may as well be sitting in a proverbial box on God&#39;s proverbial bookshelf for all the significance it is.  An example of this religion would be found in Jonah 1:9 He answered, “I worship the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are some things that have been changed.  It is actually very easy for everybody to know what they are.  They are the .5% that all scholars have already known about and well documented for centuries.  </p>

<p>Regarding contradictions, I know of one or two in the OT.  I can&#39;t think of any in the NT off the top of my head.</p>

<p>Regarding &quot;is the message Holy?&quot;  That is a little bit of a tough one to answer.  &quot;Holy&quot; means separate.  People can say true things today so it is not as if the only true things one can get are things from the bible.  The bible is &quot;Holy&quot; in the sense that it has been scrutinized for 2000 years.  In that sense it is separate, and it would not really be possible to achieve that again unless you wait another 2000 years.</p>

You don&#39;t want to discuss the presence or absence of drug use in Christianity, you&#39;re just looking to argue with people over the Internet because you discovered an edgy argument and you wanted to test it out.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Slavery&quot; when referenced in the bible is not speaking of American style slavery where Americans sailed over to a foreign country and indiscriminately rounded up random people and sold them into slavery.  That much is always wrong.</p>

<p>&quot;Slavery&quot; in the NT is talking about people who failed to pay off loans.  And yes, I actually do have a problem with American bankruptcy laws.  I do not believe people should be allowed to declare bankruptcy and walk away with no responsibility.  </p>

<p>There is one other eventuality.  That is, if two nations go to war, some people of the loosing nation may be enslaved.  In the Christian paradigm in this case, whether you are the slave master or the slave, you could both be enslaved to sin, or neither be enslaved to sin, or only the rich one or only the poor one.  Sure, it&#39;s better to be temporally free than enslaved, but in the big picture it&#39;s just a very small time span.  That&#39;s why I have no intention to resort to physical rebellion during what I believe to be our approaching enslavement.  Education, sure I&#39;ll do that.  But I don&#39;t actually expect to take up arms in rebellion when it comes.</p>

<p>That should cover your first two references.  Regarding your last reference, that is actually a different thing.  It is drawing parallels to slavery.  It is not talking about the practicalities of actual slavery.</p>

<p>And, um, in which America do I find that ability? Because I could declare bankruptcy tomorrow and all it would do is wave a big flag to the creditors holding my 5-figure student loan debt that &#39;He&#39;s over here, get him!&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s say you have 50,000 in assets, and 150,000 in debt.  You sell your ski boat to Joe for 15,000, but you report that you sold it to him for 7,000 and Joe agrees to say that too.  Then you stick 8 grand in your boot and 7 grand in the bank.  Then you declare bankruptcy and they seize 42,000 in assets and distribute it to the people you owe money to.  You have just wiped away 108,000 in debt and it only cost you 42,000 in assets.  Plus you still have 8 grand in your boot.  Even if you didn&#39;t walk away with any cash, you still walked away from 100,000 in debt.  Some things, like taxes are exempt so you have to pay that no matter what.  If you only are in debt 5 figures, you probably are not in debt enough to make it worth declaring under our current system.  You should be able to pay a small amount like that off before the hit to your credit falls off your record so it would not make sense.  Besides that, you aren&#39;t bankrupt anyway, unless your total assets is actually worth less than your debt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sigh
You miss the point here: you CANNOT get rid of student loan debt through any form of bankruptcy. It&#39;s like Herpes, it&#39;s never going away unless I can make payments on it for 20 years straight. 
And I&#39;m unemployed because of this whole 25% actual unemployment rate and the fact that even the dude down the street begging change has a college degree I was unable to get. All I got out of trying and failing college was a negative credit score. And the sad thing is $80k in student loan debt was 3 years worth of borrowing, and is less than most of my friends have. Most of them work min-wage hourly and have $100k-$150k or more in student loan debt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s in &quot;Creation Seminar Series Part 5 &#39;&#39;Dangers of Evolution&#39;&quot;, 2000 edition.  I was unable to find the 99-2000 edition on youtube.  I am listening to a more recent version in the background but I highly suspect he will not say it in this version since he was already charged when it was taped.  I could theoretically upload a photograph of myself holding the correct tape.  I am looking at it right now (I dug it out of the closet)  If it becomes necessary I&#39;ll find a VCR so I can actually play the tape.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The DSS contained fragments of every single book of the OT except the book of Esther.  Some books were 99% complete and contained multiple copies.  (Isaiah) and other books were more fragmentary.  When the DSS was compared to modern versions of the OT, they agreed with each other 99.5% of the time.  What does this prove?  This proves that the OT has not been changed significantly since before Jesus was alive.  What does this <strong>Strongly</strong> suggest?  Since the OT and the NT have been preserved at the same time, in the same way and by the same people for 2000 years it is highly logical to conclude that the NT has received the same treatment.  In fact, when we consider all known manuscript fragments of the NT, (which number over 6000 fragments if you only count the ones before 800-1000 AD) they also agree with each other 99.5% of the time.  These fragments are not represented in Qumran.  </p>

<p>The absence of NT fragments at Qumran would actually suggest that the Essenes had little association with Jesus, not much.  Also, if there were any fragments there, they would be among the absolute oldest fragments we would have. </p>

<p>But back to the topic at hand, we have fairly convincingly demonstrated that neither the OT, nor the NT have been significantly changed for 2000 years.  Given that the NT says absolutely nothing about a &quot;mushroom cult&quot; and nothing about &quot;Essenes&quot;  The whole premise becomes a huge exercise in mental gymnastics.  What we do have is four separate biographers who focus on the life of Jesus.  One starts with his birth.  The other three (basically) start with his 1.5-3 year ministry.  None of them talk about Jesus being an Essene.  All we have is mention of Jesus spending 40 days in the dessert, While in the Dessert, Jesus quotes verses of the OT that were written when Israel was in the midst of their 40 years of wandering in the dessert.  An obvious parallel.</p>

<p>This John Allegro guy has nothing but baseless speculation.  </p>

<p>The other thing that made me think this was deliberately misleading was the suggestion that the Essenes expected two Messiahs.  This is not a secret.  It is well known.  In fact the Pharisees and the Saducees also had this same theory.  In fact this theory, which was prevalent at the time, while erroneous, was even addressed in the book of Hebrews7:12-17.  Also, In the OT, and only in the original language, the sons of David are called &quot;priests&quot;  If you point that one out to an educated Jew they get really confused because David was a Judahite and only Levites were priests.  Yes the OT does predict that the coming Messiah would be a priest, and other places it says He would be a king.  The NT quite blatantly says Jesus was both priest and king.  This is no secret and to say otherwise is deliberate misinformation.</p>
