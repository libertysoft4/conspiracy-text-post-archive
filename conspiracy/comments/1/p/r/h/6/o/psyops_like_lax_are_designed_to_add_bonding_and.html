        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The SPLC is a known propaganda front for the Banking-Government Complex. Here&#39;s how they&#39;re painting the LAX psyop:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 23-year-old man who allegedly killed a TSA official at Los Angeles International Airport yesterday was carrying a one-page “manifesto” that included references to the “New World Order,” the Federal Reserve and “fiat currency,” according to a knowledgeable source with ranking law enforcement contacts.</p>

<p>Ciancia’s language and references seemed to put him squarely in the conspiracy-minded world of the antigovernment “Patriot” movement. The New World Order refers to a longstanding conspiracy theory that today, in its most popular iteration, claims that global elites are plotting to form a socialistic “one-world government” that would crush American freedoms. Often, the root of the alleged conspiracy is traced to the 1913 creation of the Federal Reserve and the adoption of fiat currency — paper money that is not backed by gold, as it was once was in the U.S.</p>

<p>Hatewatch Exclusive: Alleged LAX Shooter Referenced ‘Patriot’ Conspiracy Theories</p>

<p>splcenter.org/blog/2013/11/02/hatewatch-exclusive-alleged-lax-shooter-referenced-patriot-conspiracy-theories/</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This psyop is designed to drive division between the police/military forces and citizens that are starting to learn how the political and financial game is rigged. If the Banking-Government Complex can convince their security forces that dissenters are a bunch of dangerous antiNWO gun nuts, it makes the coming crackdown more palatable to those security forces and the 25% of the population that believes everything they see on TV.</p>

<p>In the case of LAX, this psyop is another emotional manipulation pointed toward creating a bonding experience for the police/military and increasing cohesion, as trauma often does.</p>

<p>I hope there are some cops and soldiers that can see through it. I&#39;m praying for it, actually.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My sentiments, exactly. The moment this alleged &#39;manifesto&#39; was found, it was blatantly obvious it had been authored in a contrived attempt to discredit &amp; marginalize the opposition.</p>

<p>The NWO owns, runs, and operates our government, our law enforcement, our security &amp; intelligence state apperatus. They see the growing sentiment against their fascist NWO agenda (i.e. the TSA, NSA &amp; police state) as a threat to their existence. Our military &amp; intelligence agencies specialize (spend decades researching &amp; implementing) psyop campaigns, in foreign media and domestically. This is no secret. It is in their own de-classified documents and revealed in the words of their own operatives (whistleblowers).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this tactic can be incredibly effective. At least, for those gullible enough to fall for, those who do not bother to seek the truth and believe the government is going to tell them the truth 100% of the time, even when faced with irrefutable evidence to the contrary. </p>

<p>Cognitive dissonance, plausible deniability &amp; the herd mentality rule the masses, and make it all that much easier for the stereotypical dumb American sitting on their fat asses absorbing everything they see and hear on television to be manipulated by those in power, in spite of them doing a half-ass job (for those paying attention). </p>

<p>I&#39;d also add that one of the weapons used by the Self-Appointed Powers That Be is the age-old human fear of being tricked combined with the inability of many people to admit that they&#39;ve been tricked in the first place. People don&#39;t want to admit that they got fooled, which is how con artists of all qualities, from street grifters to banking thieves, keep plying their trade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The note he allegedly left was absurd in its stereotypical rhetoric. At the same time, it is already serving its purpose: Causing fear and marginalization of those who share similar views (guilt by association).</p>

<p>Authorities were holding a &quot;drill&quot; just prior to the event for the exact scenaria, as we had scene in other false flag events. </p>

<p>Initial reports from MSM outlets stated it was a former TSA employee, as they were told by authorities. That changed, and a note was somehow found moments later.</p>

<p>There are numerous videos (from MSM coverage) showing what appears to be a dummy portrayed as the alleged victim.</p>

<p>There are alleged TSA employees coming forward alleging this was done in order to make the public complacent in allowing a fully-armed TSA, which they would oppose otherwise. Other sources back up the claim the TSA had been preparing for its employees for the past few months, just prior to this events</p>

<p>The MSM claims an illegal &quot;assault rifle&quot; was used in the attack, with media outlets already exploiting the event to push their polical agenda of stricter gun control, in spite of the weapon supposedly used already being illegal.</p>

<p>Actual eyewitness accounts from the airport claim a shotgun was used &amp; that the suspect was dressed in body armor.</p>

<p>An LAPD official stated this was an attack: &quot;We planned for..&quot; &quot;We played out today&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, those in power in our society are manipulative sociopaths that will take any means necessary to push their agenda, whether it be war or justifying the NSA, or in this instance, arming the overwhelmingly maligned (and unnecessary) TSA.</p>

<p>This could all be one happy coincidence, and while all the evidence thus far is circumstantial, it is best for one to let all of the facts come out (from all sources) before making any definitive conclusions. At this point, I&#39;m inclined to believe this is another false-flag/inside job psyop campaign. I could be wrong, and have yet to make a final determination. As I said, I prefer to wait for <strong>all</strong> of the facts to come out.</p>

<p>On a side note, what I find quite sad, as a reflection of the state political discourse in our nation, is right-wingers &amp; liberals blaming eachother for this (alleged) tragedy, as if the political idealogies of the individual (if the official narrative is 100% truthful and accurate) would have anything to do with it. If this has truly played out in the manner we are being told by the media &amp; police (who don&#39;t exactly have the best track record of honesty), one should not assume all those who are vaguely similar to the individual (i.e. race, religion, political leanings, personal beliefs, etc.) are in any way responsible for what one violent &amp; sociopathic individual has done in one isolated incident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find that laughable. Everyone knows Freemasons exist. The key was to make those who speak of them unfavorably seem &quot;crazy&quot; and in that regard the psyop was reasonably effective, as is the current psyop campaign orchestrated in the lapdog media: to label those who acknowledge the existence of the <em>New World Order</em> as &quot;crazy&quot; and &quot;terrorists&quot; using blatant propaganda.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The NWO doesn&#39;t exist, the NSA doesn&#39;t spy on American citizens, Iraq had WMDs, the government never lies &amp; CNN is always right.</em> </p>

<p><em>If you dare to say otherwise we&#39;ll label you &quot;crazy&quot; and a &quot;terrorist&quot;. Welcome the Nazi German.. I mean America. Land of the &quot;free&quot;.</em></p>

<p>Is this random violent crime hardly mentioned at all or totally ignored by mass media or government droids? If yes and it seems to serve no agenda, it&#39;s most likely just another sad story in a sad world.</p>

<p>Does this random violent crime serve an agenda and is it being reported 24/7 by major media? If yes, look further until doubts are laid to rest. If further doubts are raised and &quot;officials&quot; are being tight-lipped and secretive, it&#39;s probably a psyop of some kind.</p>

<p>Of course, every situation is different, but when dealing with any information from an &quot;official&quot; source, skepticism to the point of disbelief is an excellent defense against being suckered.</p>

<p>BTW, the War Industry Board (WWI) contained a fellow named Samuel Bush. He was the great-grandfather of George W. Bush and was one of the first members of a Federal Reserve board.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the reason i say federalization is (to my less than expert understanding), agencies such as ClA/FBl/DHS/TSA/DEA/ATF are not actually military...but directly ordered by the executive  branch. Thus building an army outside of the &#39;military&#39; which is supposed to be accountable to congress/citizens. Combine it with 0bama&#39;s &quot;purge&quot; of generals in the military, and i see a federalized army trying to win the loyalty of state/local forces -- more so than the military trying to do that...</p>
