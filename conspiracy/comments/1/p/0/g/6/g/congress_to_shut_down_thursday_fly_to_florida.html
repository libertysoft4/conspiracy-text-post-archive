    <div class="md"><p>On Oct 25-28, 2013 California will be holding a 100+ city, 72-hour, cross agency anti-terrorism drill called Urban Shield.

<p>I bring this up due to the fact that these training drills have a tenancy to &quot;go-live&quot; via drill hijack and become real-world events. A drill hijack is when they use aspects of a drill to provide cover for a real (planned) event that mimics the general theme of the drill itself giving them &quot;plausible deniability&quot; via &quot;miscommunication&quot; (an out) if they happen to be caught prior to the &quot;point of no return&quot; in the hijacked aspect of the operation.</p>

<p>There are 3 major types of drill hijacks.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Event Overlapping Drill - When a scheduled drill, and a similar real world event happen in the same general area at the same time as each-other, with similar overall themes (MSELs).
Example: For the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting event the (overlap) drill hijack was done via a DHS child disaster response course that was being held 20 miles from Sandy Hook Elementary in Bridgeport CT, which was then overlapped with an active shooter drill being held in a neighboring county (Putnam). Both these drills were being held at the exact same time as the SH event.

Thread: Sandy Hook Hoax: A Detailed Breakdown of the Sandy Hook Elementary Shooting </p></li>
<li><p>Event Shadowing Drill - When a scheduled drill is held, and shortly after the drill that general area has a real-world event of the same general theme (MSEL) as the drill that was just ran shortly before.
Example: For the Santa Monica shooting event the (shadowed) drill hijack was the anti-terrorism drill that was held in LA the day prior on June 6, 2013 (666) in which the &quot;shooter&quot; John Zawahri was an &quot;off the record&quot; participant of (he thinks he is an official drill participant but really isn&#39;t). They then trick John into agreeing to participate in a continuation of the (none-existent) drill hijack the following day in Santa Monica, where he is then framed for a real crime via event overwrite/substitution.

Thread: SANTA MONICA SHOOTING (Echo): Wanna Know How They Pulled It Off? </p></li>
<li><p>Event Foreshadowing Drill - When a drill is scheduled for an area, but before the drill is able to run, a real-world event takes place closely matching the not yet run drills script (MSEL).
Example: For the Boston Bombing event the (foreshadowed) drill hijack was Urban Shield Boston 2013 which was scheduled for June 15-16, 2013. The drill hijack then occurs at the Boston Marathon exactly 2 months before the USB13 drill is to take place resulting in &quot;The real thing happened before we were able to execute&quot;, using the exact location (opposite side of the street) with the exact same theme of the previous years Urban Shield drill (Urban Shield Boston 2012).

</ol>

<p>Anyways I just bring this all up so people will keep an extra eye on the Cali area during (and shortly after) this drill, in-case something does actually go down. I personally think if something were to happen, it would happen the day following the official drill (Oct 29,2013). I have various reasons to think this but I am not going to go into them right now, but if a real event does take place around this time it will likely involve a large school campus (likely in San Diego) OR a high traffic airport (likely LAX or SFO) with the combined theme of backpack bombs &amp; assault weapons. Anyways stay safe everyone, and hopefully nothing will happen in Cali around this drill, unlike what happened recently in Boston...</p>
