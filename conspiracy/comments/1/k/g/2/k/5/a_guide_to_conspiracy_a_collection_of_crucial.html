        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">115</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2013-08-15 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Three_Letter_Agency.html">Three_Letter_Agency</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>The Nature and Prevalence of Psychopathy</strong></p>

<p>It all starts with <a href="http://www.thepeopleshistory.net/2013/08/psychopathy-power-and-politics.html">understanding the nature and prevalence of <em>psychopathy</em>.</a></p>

<p>A psychopath is not like you and I. Nor are they like the crazy and violent murderers portrayed in the media. Psychologists have repeatedly shown that the psychopath is not crazy; they are rational and often very intelligent. They have no conscience, no shame, no remorse, no guilt. They seek power at every opportunity. They have a desire to manipulate and control people for the sake of manipulation and control. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“There is no such thing, in the psychopathic universe, as the &#39;merely weak&#39;. Whoever is weak is also a sucker; that is, someone who demands to be exploited”- Psychologist Robert Rieber </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Estimates put the number of psychopaths as between 1 and 4% of the population. That translates to between 3 and 12 million psychopaths in the United States. For every psychopath that gets caught with a crime or abuse and ends up in the prison and in newspapers, there are many more that have completely concealed their condition from society, hidden behind a magnetic personality and an endless list of lies.</p>

<p>Psychopathy is not a new phenomenon either; since the beginning of recorded history it has been psychopaths who have been the driving factors behind wars, genocides, empires and dynasties. They manipulate societies for the simple reason that people are easily manipulated.</p>

<p>Long ago psychopaths began colluding with each other against the common man, gathering in cabals and secret societies to collectively control the masses, bound by their distinct &#39;otherness&#39; and desire for control.</p>

<p>These are the people that run the world.</p>

<p><strong>The Roots of Fascism in America</strong></p>

<p>By World War II, fascist interests already had a pretty strong grip in the US from banking and industry. The war gave these psychopaths the perfect opportunity to spread their tentacles. Before the war even ended, the US began secretly securing the safety of thousands of high profile Nazis. <a href="http://www.thepeopleshistory.net/2013/06/operation-paperclip-nazis-deeply.html">Over 1,500 were brought to America</a>, most with whitewashed histories or completely new identities. The real enemy was never the Nazis but the Soviet Union, and as such the <a href="http://www.thepeopleshistory.net/2013/06/operation-paperclip-part-ii-absorbing.html">Nazi&#39;s eastern front intelligence unit was virtually kept intact</a> after the war, with over 100 former SS and Gestapo officers, many rampant war criminals, now being employed by the US. Congress passed the National Security Act in 1947 that consolidated existing intelligence services into the CIA, which was given immense power without checks and balances. They went straight to work abusing power.</p>

<p><strong>Mind Control</strong></p>

<p>One of the <a href="http://www.thepeopleshistory.net/2013/07/mk-ultra-cia-and-mind-control.html">first major CIA operations was MK ULTRA.</a>. The MK stands for mind control.</p>

<p>I want to take a step back, briefly, and reiterate that in 1949, when the precursors to MK ULTRA were underway, the best way to describe the situation is as: a cabal of psychopaths at the CIA, who had the strong desire to manipulate and control people, began a massive research program without oversight into drugs, propaganda, hypnosis and other methods to develop the most effective ways to control the minds of individuals and populations.</p>

<p>Most of the files of MK ULTRA were destroyed by an order from former director Richard Helms. The only surviving documents were discovered a few years later because they were accidentally filed under the wrong category. </p>

<p>The CIA claims that they ended the MK ULTRA program because it was ineffective. However, documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act show a much different story.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="http://cryptome.org/mkultra-0001.htm">one declassified document regarding drug trials</a> claims that “Six specific products have been developed and are available for operational use. Three of them P1, C1, and C9, are discrediting and disabling materials which can be administered unwittingly and permit the exercise of a measure of control over the actions of the subject. These have been used in six different operations on a total of 33 subjects.”</p>

<p>There are more shocking declassified documents as well. <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/mind_control/foia_mind_control/190684.4_hypnosis_mind_control_girls">One document detailing the study of hypnosis</a> states: “It has been shown clearly that physically individuals can be induced into H [hypnosis] by telephone, by receiving written matter, or by the use of code, signal, or words. Control of those hypnotized can be passed from one individual to another without great difficulty. It has also been shown by experimentation with these girls that they can act as unwilling couriers for information purposes, and that they can be conditioned to a point where they believe a change in identity on their part even on the polygraph.” </p>

<p>What motivation would a psychopath have for ending a program showing success that allowed them to control and manipulate people? What was contained in the mass of destroyed files? How advanced has mind control become since the 70&#39;s?</p>

<p><strong>False Flag Terrorism</strong></p>

<p>The CIA began a <a href="http://www.thepeopleshistory.net/2013/06/operation-gladio-how-cia-invented-false.html">program known as Operation Gladio</a> in the 1950s. The CIA and NATO began arming radical right wing groups throughout Europe in an effort to prevent any successful Soviet invasion. They were considered &#39;stay-behind paramilitary groups&#39;, the goal would be to wreak havoc on any occupying army. The Soviet invasion never came, but the scope of Gladio kept expanding. The stay-behind paramilitary groups began using violence as a means of suppressing domestic leftism. There are multiple examples of terrorist attacks being blamed on leftists that Gladio groups were responsible for. It marginalized any leftist dissent from the public and made the populace dependent on the state for protection. </p>

<p>Many groups integrated themselves in crime and politics, become powerful covert forces. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_state">This is known as the &#39;deep state&#39;</a>, a powerful coalition of undemocratic forces comprised of high level intelligence, military and criminal enterprises. Deep states have developed control over most countries we consider to be &#39;free and democratic&#39;, including the United States.</p>

<p>The last confirmed meeting of Gladio was in 1990, just a few years before the first World Trade Center bombing. </p>

<p>Again, we must ask ourselves what motivation a psychopath would have to end an effective program such as Gladio, as there is no evidence it was ever dismantled.</p>

<p><strong>Propaganda</strong></p>

<p>The CIA immediately began propagandizing the citizens of the United States under a program called <a href="http://www.thepeopleshistory.net/2013/06/operation-mockingbird-look-at-cia.html">Operation Mockingbird</a>. They befriended editors, payed off journalists, created fake news stories, and even owned publications.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;About a third of the whole CIA budget went to media propaganda operations. ...We&#39;re talking about hundreds of millions of dollars a year just for that.....close to a billion dollars are being spent every year by the United States on secret propaganda.&quot; Testimony of William Schapp in 1999, referencing revelations from the Church Committee in 1975 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, we must ask ourselves what motivation a psychopath would have to end an effective program such as Mockingbird.</p>

<p>Their ownership is  somewhat obfuscated </p>

<p>I suspect that the Rothschild family  secretly controls  all central banks for every nation except North Korea  Iran, Cuba and maybe  a couple of others.</p>

<p>We  will be  fighting war&#39;s against them all to force  them to also have Rothschild controlled central banks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great work. A lot of people think that the US government would never do anything against the will of its citizens. This is a little bit off topic but another great resource that I like to point people to is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States">this Wikipedia page</a> which has many credible sources. Now that the CIA pretty much doesn&#39;t keep records of these things anymore I wonder what kinds of programs are in effect at the present.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The CIA isn&#39;t part of the American government but the mole that undermines it. It is filled with the children of the wealthy and their minions. It is not civil service in the sense that people are not hired based on competitive exams but based on their family connections. The department of homeland security is the same. These are the tools of the wealthy that they 
have used to change the US and the world to their liking.</p>

<p>But don&#39;t underestimate greed. These families have not gotten more and more wealthy without being motivated by greed.</p>
