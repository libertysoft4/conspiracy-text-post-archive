        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am an Egyptian and here is my take on what is going on in Egypt.</p>

<p><strong>Western Media:</strong></p>

<p>This is the biggest joke I have ever seen in my entire life, its like all the news sources / channel gets their news from the same source. The amount of bias and alteration of truth is laughable. The coverage of Egypt is a joke. Its all about the flow of money. You don&#39;t bite the hand that feeds you. (paying your salary)</p>

<p><strong>American Government:</strong></p>

<p>The American government paid billions of dollars to the Muslim brotherhood to have them under their control (an american puppet like Mubarak before) The American government want the best interest of Israel and doesn&#39;t care about Egypt or Egyptian people at all. That is why they are upset that the people removed the Muslim brotherhood and call it a military coup to make it sound negative or wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Egyptian Military:</strong> </p>

<p>is not interested in power at all. They saw the country getting lost and saved it before it is too late. That is after millions of people went to streets. The Egyptian military didn&#39;t take action on its own.</p>

<p><strong>Muslim Brotherhood:</strong></p>

<p>A crime syndicate. Yes they are the equivalent of organized crime, they have nothing to do with Islam or politics. They are the equivalent of New World Order, but in middle-east scale. They have big plans to change the middle east and the world. They use the image of Islam to have favor and control over the simple people, the poor and the weak. They use the image of Islam, so any attacks on them, is an attack in Islam. They deliberately want to create chaos and civil war to get the american and international support so they can remain in power. They sought power for many years. Mubarak was keeping them under control. And for good reason. We can see it now. They are only interested in power and control. Not Islam, not Egypt, not politics. To be honest they ruin the image of Islam and Muslims everywhere. Who shoots in a mosque? who kills police and military? Islam has nothing to do with those people. They are a crime syndicated as I said before who has the word &quot;Muslim&quot; in their name.</p>

<p><strong>Egyptian People:</strong></p>

<p>They saw their country lost. Country divided, economy in ruin, muslim brotherhood buying and taking everything in Egypt for their own gain. They went down to the streets in millions to save the country which was going downhill.</p>

<p><strong>Qatar:</strong></p>

<p>Qatar had business with the Muslim Brotherhood. Billions of dollars. They are upset about their money. They are in bed with U.S. government and Israel. Aljazeera is their channel. They where trying to buy parts of Egypt.</p>

<p><strong>Aljazeera:</strong></p>

<p>Aljazeera is as biased as western media, their coverage of Egypt is a big joke. They don&#39;t care about the truth. They show the Muslim brotherhood in a positive light, they deliberately change the truth and make the military and the police look and sound evil. Some of their top news editors quit for their journalistic integrity. Their Egypt branch has been shutdown because of them spreading lies. Completely opposite of all channels. To push Qatar, U.S and Israel agenda.</p>

<p><strong>Gulf Countries:</strong></p>

<p>Are aware of the Muslim Brotherhood plans not only in Egypt but in Gulf Countries as well. One of the few countries that truly support Egypt. (except Qatar)</p>

<p><strong>Turkey:</strong></p>

<p>Erdogan is in relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood and fear for the eradication of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. (also other countries with heavy influence of Muslim Brotherhood and other islamic/politics organizations)</p>

<p><strong>Germany:</strong></p>

<p>Sadly an American puppet also. Repeats what America says. Almost like a parrot.</p>

<p><strong>Mursi:</strong></p>

<p>A puppet of the Muslim Brotherhood which is a puppet of the U.S government. Failed as a president of Egypt. His only goal was to further the Muslim Brotherhood goods. Egypt economy was in free fall and he failed to better the country or stabilize it. I don&#39;t really know how he was elected president in the first place. He failed to do his job to fix the country and was pushed aside by the military on request of the people.</p>

<p><strong>Obama:</strong> </p>

<p>has been funding Islamic groups both in Syria and Egypt. Threatens to remove U.S. aid to Egypt (sadly how U.S. control the world). By loaning money and threatening to cut it. You either with us or against us. Same thing happened with Venezuela. Because Venezuela was independent financially (not trading oil with the rest of the world because they where self sufficient), U.S. was not happy with that. Same thing happened with Libya. Obama stuck in a crossroad. Does&#39;t know whether to cut or not cut the Egyptian military aid because he want Egypt with good favor with him. To maintain safety of Israel and peace treaty. Obama under heavy criticism over this and NSA spying.</p>

<p><strong>Military Coup? Yes or No?:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Yes</em></strong> if you listen to western media and Aljazeera. American government want it to be coup and all of the western countries and Qatar.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>No</em></strong> if you care about the truth. If you ask any Egyptian in the street, muslim or christian who is not of the Muslim Brotherhood.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Democracy in the middle east?:</strong> </p>

<p>To be honest, the problem with democracy in middle east is that it wont work properly. 40% of Egypt is illiterate/ uneducated. About 50% is poor or under the poverty line. Having democracy in a country like this wont work. Democracy should be based on a country where most people are educated. I know this sound extreme. But the only reason muslim brotherhood reached power is that people tried to avoid military rule, so they voted for muslim brotherhood. Also the poor and illiterate voted for the Muslim Brotherhood. They won by 0.5%. (If you have an island of 10% scientist and 90% clowns. Democracy would be a cruel joke.)</p>

<p>Just follow the money trail to see who benefit and who lose from the chaos in Egypt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually the American government has deliberately stayed clear of labelling/treating what went down in Egypt as a coup in order to keep the flow of military and economic aid going. The Muslim Brotherhood probably isn&#39;t favored by them any more than Mubarak was, they just happened to be on top for awhile. Regardless, I  can just about guarantee that whoever comes out of this current mess with political control will be just as willing to get cozy with the Americans as his predecessors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>French/european, The way i got western medias :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The American government want the best interest of Israel and doesn&#39;t care about Egypt or Egyptian people at all. That is why their upset that the people removed the Muslim brotherhood and call it a military coup to make it sound negative or wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first sentence is half true. The US are primarily concerned about Israel (edit : and keeping the suez channel open too). Doesn&#39;t mean they need to screw you over anyway (the only thing they really don&#39;t want is a war between israel and Egypt or channel closed, everything else is bargainable). They&#39;ll just try to bargain and deal with whoever is in power. They have also been very careful not to call it a coup when morsi was pushed off; and most people abroad aren&#39;t sure what to believe, so we just watch from afar.</p>

<p>On the other hand a lot of people where saddened to see the military answer so heavy handedly by fireing back on the brotherhood (yes i know the brotherhood armed civilians with AK and told them to fire first, but higher power means higher responsabilities blablabla cops and military being held to a higher standard etc, the should have arrested them not fire back without looking and causing that much dead :/).</p>

<p>Oh and btw Western media are showing both side on a grey-and-grey light. Military being heavy handed but not evil; brotherhood being power hungry and ready to sacrifice people for their rush for power but democratically elected and at least partially supported by a large swath of the country :/</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sadly an American puppet also. Repeats what America says. Almost like a parrot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>French here, i believe the european pov i got is mostly the one i just quoted. We&#39;re mainly pissed the military fired with live ammo because it makes us look bad by showing support to the military then having then turning hardass, nothing else.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No if you care about the truth. If you ask any Egyptian in the street, muslim or christian who is not of the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s the kicker, the last part of your sentance : there&#39;s a lot of egyptians supporting the brotherhood out of town. Last i heard it was like 30% of the country. It wouldn&#39;t be very clever on our side to just spit on a very large number of egyptians either. That and the crack down with live ammo is the main reason why the west is so unconclusive over that story.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>40% of Egypt is illiterate/ uneducated. About 50% is poor or under the poverty line. Having democracy in a country like this wont work. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If nothing else, our own past taught us to be careful about people deciding our own life for our own good beyond our close friends and family :( Because people abused it time and time again in our own history. Even if the current military leaders aren&#39;t bad guys, who&#39;se to say what happen when they get to old to really lead and you end up with another corrupt state like mubarak&#39;s in the end ? </p>

<p>So why should we take a direct side here instead of watching the sense wind will blow before doing anything too rash ? We did act in Syria and end up with a civil war destroying half the country when they weren&#39;t muslim extremists at start. Lots of deads and a destroyed country is bad business for everyone.</p>

<p>Edit : BTW I think you&#39;re angry at occident for what&#39;s going on in your country and see us as responsable. Maybe, because we backed the first military coup then the elections. But then we&#39;re not your ennemy, and won&#39;t try to be. Sometime we&#39;re not sure what to believe either. Just because we do not hand you immediate ressources when asked does not mean we&#39;re just (muhahah) ploting the &quot;fall of egypt&quot; or something. No matter what we do or don&#39;t do somebody will blame us. :/</p>

<p>Edit 2 : Said post summarize quite nicely part of the issue : <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Egypt/comments/1kk1dy/here_are_the_top_10_american_corporations/cbpz8eo">www.reddit.com/r/Egypt/comments/1kk1dy/here_are_the_top_10_american_corporations/cbpz8eo</a> . For the lazy, that quote summarize it even further (think of it as a tl;dr) :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>THAT&#39;S why the US is giving Egypt aid. That&#39;s why they are getting Block 52 F-16&#39;s and Apaches. You are getting it for free because it&#39;s worth the billions (according to current policy) to keep the balance of power in play, even if Egypt can&#39;t afford the hardware to make it happen. People think it&#39;s about having a handle of power in the Egyptian government, or making a few million for Lockheed, but in the end it&#39;s just not that simple. In the end the US doesn&#39;t care who is in power in Egypt. That&#39;s for the Egyptian people to decide. So long as Egypt remains a nation state and that canal stays open, the region stays secure, and global war does not ensue.</p>

<p>The Arab Springs were hijacked by Saudi-American agenda to continue the expansion of the War on Terror and overthrow Iran through political isolation (Libya and Sirya).</p>

<p>Apparently Saudi Arabia and Israel became warry when Mubarak was replaced by the Muslim Brotherhood. Even while Saudi may have enjoyed greater reach through the expansion of the salafists governments in Libya and Tunisia, ultimately the Arab Springs were becoming too unstable.</p>

<p>Qatar&#39;s Emir just resigned, a sign that his support of the Muslim Brotherhood obviously back-fired.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He has business relationship with The Muslim Brotherhood. Money. It had influence in the Turkish government. He removed people from the military. The Turkish people noticed how his Islamic influences started to affect Turkey which is a liberal state. (Egypt also was always a liberal state) Look at the countries mad at Egypt now. They are mad for a reason. If the Muslim Brotherhood fail in Egypt. They will never succeed in any other country. (also other political Islam organizations will fail)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really hope you are a troll, I don&#39;t want to believe any Egyptian with access to the internet can be so ignorant. I lost it when you said this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Egyptian Military:</p>

<p>is not interested in power at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The truth is Mubarak was a general! He was the military. That&#39;s how he took power. The military was in power for the last couple decades with Mubarak as their figurehead. The military is the most powerful economic force in Egypt (owning lots of factories and services.)</p>

<p>Nobody is more deeply invested in controlling Egypt&#39;s future than the military. They are greatly interested in power, particularly to maintain the status quo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The American government paid billions of dollars to the Muslim brotherhood to have them under their control (an american puppet like Mubarak before) The American government want the best interest of Israel and doesn&#39;t care about Egypt or Egyptian people at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The American government doesn&#39;t care about the Egyptian people? The entire reason they supported the Muslim Brotherhood is because the Western World wanted Egyptians to have democracy. It was a stupid and short sighted plan to think the Egyptian people were ready for it, and it was even stupider to trust the Muslim Brotherhood&#39;s promises, but it&#39;s not our fault 75% of you Egyptians voted for Islamist political parties in the first free elections you had! You&#39;re like those people that shoot themselves in the foot and claim they were mugged to prevent further embarrassment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re Egyptian?  Have you forgotten that &quot;your&quot; country was ruled by the military since the coup in 1952?  And they&#39;re perfectly comfortable suddenly giving it up?  </p>

<p>And pray tell, after several decades of giving aid to the Egyptian military, making them the wealthiest and most powerful group in the country, the US government has suddenly decided to back the other horse?  (don&#39;t be fooled by US aid to Egypt, it&#39;s all just discounts on American weapons and ammo)</p>

<p>&quot;the only reason muslim brotherhood reached power is that people tried to avoid military rule.&quot;  Well done! You&#39;ve successfully contradicted your earlier statement that the military &quot;don&#39;t want power at all.&quot;  Bonus points for the condescending tone describing anyone who doesn&#39;t like military rule as uneducated.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Islamic politics has all the answers (I&#39;m rather opposed to any religion or overarching ideology in politics), but I will say that it&#39;s been the most effective avenue in the Middle East for critics of western-controlled/allied countries like Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, etc.  The roots of the conflict and current chaos are the same as the rest of the Arab Spring; The Arab world has been treated like neo-colonial possessions, a situation maintained by corrupt leaders who were propped up by the western democracies.  </p>

<p>&quot;That is why their upset that the people removed the Muslim brotherhood and call it a military coup to make it sound negative or wrong.&quot;  - wow, firstly, it&#39;s they&#39;re, not their.  Secondly, &quot;the people&quot; is a very ubiquitous term, such a broad term in fact that one might get confused when you use it because I was under the impression the military removed the muslim brotherhood.  Thridly, the US government went through great pains to avoid calling it a coup so they could continue sending aid to their allies; the Egyptian military.</p>

<p>Never thought I&#39;d say this but I really hope you&#39;re a troll.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will make it simple. The goal in Egypt is the same as in Iraq, Libya, and Syria - destruction of infrastructure and reallocation of wealth.  In Egypt that could not have been accomplished in one step as was done in Iraq and Libya, and currently going on in Syria.  So step one was to give power to a religious extremist group that would demolish the economy.  Step two, help to depose this religious group.  Step three, help to arm the religious extremists and encourage them to fight back for their &quot;legitimate rights&quot;.  In the end, Arab Spring for all...</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Democracy should be based on a country where most people are educated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So not the USA, let me explain why I think so.</p>

<p>People here are educated, but ignorant. Some believe they know what is going on, because Fox News told them. Others don&#39;t even watch TV and have zero idea about what goes on in the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Democracy is a good idea on a small scale, in small countries. But in large countries, the needs of the people in Detroit are far different than the needs of people in Washington. </p>

<p>And big issues like &#39;gay marriage&#39;, &#39;seperation of religion and state&#39;, &#39;Legalization of Weed&#39;, etc should not be voted on by the general public, but by people who have studied the issues and submitted their findings to lawmakers. If the reseachers ever find new material, then the laws need to be updated to reflect the studies. All studies need to be made public. All laws need to be posted in an easily accessible way.</p>

<p>If anyone disagrees with the result, it could be submitted for review, after they have read all the studies on a topic.</p>

<p>Democracy as it is, is not a good system anywhere.</p>

<h2>EDIT: Do not vote this to the top, as it has nothing to do with egypt. @OP, thanks for the post.</h2>
