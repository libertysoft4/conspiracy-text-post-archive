<p>I just made an interesting observation. Whenever I browse the Frontpage of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> I constantly notice threads from all kind of subreddits like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a>, <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>... even <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a> has become full with top comments of people realising the situation.</p>

<p>I often wonder if the post I am currently reading is in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and am consistenly suprised, that it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Is it only my perception or is a big bunch of the community acknowledging, what <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is claiming for years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;d be surprised how many redditors are quick to dismiss us as conspiritards no matter how many conspiracies actually prove true. When multiple sources CONSPIRE to LIE about the official story that creates a CONSPIRACY. The word theory is there to be dismissive. Conspiracy theorists predicted the existence of a massive NSA domestic spying program, the fact Saddam never had any WMDs, the Benghazi embassy attack cover up (supposedly an impromptu protest against an &quot;anti-Islam&quot; youtube video was a highly coordinated attack, not to mention CIA agents were on the ground *according to CNN)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he means &#39;fight&#39; in the sense to struggle against repression and see the truth through to the end. 
  The end goal is the truth, but the journey is the fight. The cognitive dissonance one experiences every day on their daily grind through their evidently benal bullshit existence, their self awareness of the surrounding paradigm being the only driving force towards the end goal and the removal of the status quo as the ubiquitous inevitability from peoples cortex&#39;s and the resultant influx equilibrium and truth.   As we continue our fight, with more people adjusting their worldview to be less reliant on outside forces (propaganda) which act as the desert of thought filled with an oasis of easy apathy and contantedness and more in  their own humanness, we can only hope that we will see the masks fall from these institutions built around us. There is a fight. 
The truth needs a bodyguard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. But these conspiracies exists long time before we found something about them in conspiracy theories. Therefore we must not feel weak. We must realize that actualy beleiving in authorities would not help us with this. We have the power when we beleive in ourselves. That is a way to live against them. What the media say is manipulation, We do not need all the crap they say about in adds. We are great people at this single moment and manipulation is rigged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no, yes because everything that&#39;s been reported on by the media is accepted but that&#39;s the problem everybody is like &quot;the media is bad!!&quot; but then as soon as they report something they are all ears while over here are mostly legitiment stories. But they won&#39;t believe it because it&#39;s not on the news. So yes because people are slightly more opened to different thinking but no because they still only accept what is on the TV.</p>

<p>This is a link to a video  <a href="http://youtu.be/rYDxCazAQTU">http://youtu.be/rYDxCazAQTU</a> that I found on a old Reddit post that shows someone in so much fear to answer a question. Like she knew one wrong word would get her brains splattered. Listen very carefully with the questions asked and the answers given. </p>

<p>Here is her evidence. 
<a href="http://www.drjudywood.com/articles/DEW/StarWarsBeam1.html">http://www.drjudywood.com/articles/DEW/StarWarsBeam1.html</a></p>

<p>Then read this speech from September 10,2001 by then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld<br/>
<a href="http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=430">http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=430</a></p>

<p>My opinion about the speech is he was letting us know on what was going to happen for us doing something what he and his associates think was wrong for our own good. Like a parent giving a lecture before a spanking for the kids own good on something the kid had no control over,or something the kid didn&#39;t even do to begin with. </p>

<p>The Pentagon Bureaucracy orchestrated the 9/11 attacks using all their resources to get us to continue to finance and go along with their plan. Look where we are today since then as a Nation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Building 7 seems to have collapsed because the structure was exotic and experimental (so it could be built over the substation) and Silverstein ordered firefighters to let it burn. But as far as i can tell, the twin towers were not 100% airliner proof. Either way, i just found about about the fake Atta passport and fake bin Laden tapes, so I k kw those guys weren&#39;t involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A part of me wants to think that an increasing number of redditors are willing to be open to facts which seem to negate the standard narrative for a number of different commonly discussed topics.  I think Snowden&#39;s revelations about the NSA&#39;s mass surveillance of American citizens really tipped the scale, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s been a more gradual transition that&#39;s only recently made a smaller, sudden influx.</p>

<p>On that note, I&#39;ve also noticed an increase in troll and otherwise abusive accounts in typically &quot;conspiracy&quot; related threads, given the greater exposure in the subreddits you&#39;ve mentioned.  The only thing that makes them stand out to me is that they tend to <em>only</em> gravitate towards these sort of threads, which leads me to wonder if there&#39;s a growing opposition, perhaps even artificially so.  Logically, this possible conclusion just makes me wonder if there&#39;s another group of folks who have made the same observation regarding the increased open-mindedness and have concluded that such an increase is unacceptable in relation to their goals.</p>

  The end goal is the truth, but the journey is the fight. The cognitive dissonance one experiences every day on their daily grind through their evidently benal bullshit existence, their self awareness of the surrounding paradigm being the only driving force towards the end goal and the removal of the status quo as the ubiquitous inevitability from peoples cortex&#39;s and the resultant influx equilibrium and truth.   As we continue our fight, with more people adjusting their worldview to be less reliant on outside forces (propaganda) which act as the desert of thought filled with an oasis of easy apathy and contantedness and more in  their own humanness, we can only hope that we will see the masks fall from these institutions built around us. There is a fight. 
The truth needs a bodyguard.</p>
