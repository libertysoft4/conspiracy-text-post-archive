    <div class="md"><p>And get ready for it.</p>

<p>&quot;Anyone who believes that six months of weekly taekwondo classes, a weekend-long NRA Basic Pistol class, and a box of ammunition each year is enough to stop a blood-thirsty mob of criminal thugs, unbound my social convention or legal restraint—whether they wear gang colors or jack-boots and uniforms—is a delusional moron.</p>

<p>Of course, the path of history may, God willing, change course. The Republic may be restored peaceably. You may never face these dangers. You may die of old age, peacefully in your bed, surrounded by a legion of loving children and grandchildren.</p>

<p>Or, you may die, face down in the mud of a wet, dark, night, choking on your own blood and lung tissue, a burst of 7.62x51mmNATO machine-gun rounds through your chest, listening to the screams of your wife and children, as the mob drags them off to a living hell. The choice is yours.&quot;</p>

<p>Prepare, SERIOUSLY prepare. If you wanna know how vets see most &quot;preppers&quot; this <a href="http://mountainguerrilla.blogspot.com/2012/01/combat-mindset-killer-instinct-and.html?m=1">essay</a> should give you a good idea of the mental disconnect between those who are preparing for an Apocalypse and those who have been through hell and are preparing for it to return.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Live.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t live in fear.</p>

<p>Learn to sort the chaff from the daily tsunami of disinformation, bullshit and lies trying to convince you of giving up your rights or sending you or your loved ones to die in some godforsaken place across the globe.</p>

<p>Inform those around you, teach them to understand most of what is said to be news &amp; entertainment is lies, propaganda, conditioning.</p>

<p>Learn to be self-sufficient. Be prepared for a natural or created catastrophe. Don&#39;t dig a bunker and stockpile ammo &amp; food for a decade, but have supplies and means to provide energy and security for two weeks. Specially if you live in natural disaster-prone areas. </p>

<p>Stay back when you feel you have dig yourself into a hole. It&#39;s easy to dive deep into conspiracy events and at one moment you will doubt even the fingers on your hand. Beware. Don&#39;t let that destroy your life, your family, your usual occupations.</p>

<p>Prepare for the what-ifs: what if the net fails? What if my daily electronic communications are proven to be 100% insecure? What if my livehood, my neighborhood, my way of life is threatened by this or that social, technological or authority development? How will I react? </p>

<p>Create social nets with your loved ones, family, friends, mutual interest acquaintances. Learn to use the tools that we usually just use for entertainment so they become useful for social activity and keeping your rights.</p>

<p>Many people in power have vested interest in keeping all of us  in fear, despondent, thinking it&#39;s all a game set up decades ago and there is nothing to do. I want to believe that we can change things, maybe not in spectacular broad strokes that become global headlines, but also everyday, just by refusing to accept lies and standing up when needed. </p>

<p>Good luck. We all are going to need it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me preface this with stating that i am writing this for anyone reading, not just OP.  </p>

<p>First I would like to point out its not that black and white–it&#39;s not conspiracy theory or official story. Disinformation (false &#39;conspiracy&#39; evidence spread by intelligencd communities to discredit &#39;conspiracy throries&#39;) is real. Controlled opposition is real. The alternative media <em>is</em> infilitrated and compromised. There is also a decent amount of pseudoscientific and sensationalist shit that gets lumped into the alt media. Of course don&#39;t take my word for it but in your research be open to the possibility and it will start to reveal itself. These guys are smart enough to do everything theyve done, if anyone thinks theyre not smart enough to infiltrate and manipulate conspiracy communities, i think you should reconsider. The first introduction that broke my &quot;either or&quot; philosophy on it all was probably <a href="http://www.wikispooks.com/ISGP/intro.htm">this</a>, <a href="http://www.wikispooks.com/ISGP/faq.htm#5">this</a> and <a href="http://www.wikispooks.com/ISGP/miscellaneous/disinformation/911/pentahole_dimensions_est.htm">this</a>. The empirical evidence that I have looked into thus far, seems to align with his contention. And even if the more fringe things (chemtrails, lizard people, HAARP, etc) are true, there is enough slander against them on top of the fact that there is no where near anything close to conclusive proof for them–id say theyre &#39;possible&#39; but i wouldnt push it to &#39;probable&#39; and definitely not &#39;certain&#39;–that they should be avoided if our goal is to wake people up and incite action (and to what extent these things are or arent true, we still more or less have the same path). Leading someone into a bottomless rabbit hole of unprovable conspiracies only perpetuates fear and hopelessness (this sub and even some of these comments are evidence of that–most are hopeless as hell). Of course if people, once they are awake want to see how deep the rabbit hole goes then be my guest (i love to read the more out there stuff), but there is enough tangible, empirical evidence to wake anyone up and to keep you with something to read/learn for the rest of your life, so I do think we need to manage priorities a little better. </p>

<p>Our fate is only as determined as we allow it to be. The powers that be have been at it for decades. certain aristocratic segments (Rothschilds for example) have been at it for centuries. But that doesn&#39;t mean things are hopeless. In fact, they rely on our [all people] complacency and they assuredly are doing everything they can to perpetuate it because they know that if we had confidence as a unit, they&#39;d be fucked. They do have massive influence, power, and money,  and a more sophisticated understanding of psychology, propaganda and brainwashing than we can even begin to imagine, but that doesn&#39;t mean we are fucked. It seems to me much of the alt media paints these entities as much more powerful than they are–i dont know if its disinfo or just not enough understanding on their part, but regardless there is much more hope than most alt news sites will lead you to believe. If you keep looking and keep your sources as varied as possible, I think you will come to the same conclusion.  If you think we are fucked, I think it&#39;s likely you have fallen victim to at least  <em>some</em> warping of the information, because we are actually winning. Signs point to them expecting having been much further ahead in the &#39;plan&#39; than they are. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHqpJUSKQEA">They are losing control and they know it</a>. Whether they lose enough for us to actually win is yet to be determined. But that lies entirely on us and our ability to effectively wake people up. They dont have absolute control. They dont have all the answers. Theyre just smart guys with a lust for power, a lot of money, and an ability to adapt to changing circumstances. However, they rely on us for everything–our complicity is the only thing which gives them power. If we can stratgtize and adapt even 1/10th as well as they can, we got this shit in the bag easy. </p>

<p>With that said: Spouting off everything we read on places like Info Wars or Natural News likes its gospel is not going to net a good ratio of waking people up. Maybe people like Jones or Adams really believes in what theyre doing and have the best of intentions, but that doesn&#39;t mean theyre right or that others should follow suit.  They do speak some truth but they also twists shit (and even if they didn&#39;t, when Jones gets as much publicity as he does and acts like a lunatic on national TV he is hardly someone I think should support).  Same goes for a lot of other alternative media sites out there. </p>

<p>Thinking we are privy to secret information and better and smarter  than everyone else is the same. knowing this stuff doesn&#39;t make us any of those things. Calling someone stupid, or any ad homenium, because they think &#39;conspiracy theories are bullshit&#39; is not helping us. Same goes for telling people about this stuff or arguing about it before we really know what were talking about. People doing these things is why places like <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> exist. If youre going to freak out on someone like a child and spout some bullshit you read like its a fact just because it came from an alt news site or going around calling people stupid/sheeple/shills/etc , you honestly should send your resumè to the CIA because you might as well get paid for doing their job for them. I&#39;m not trying to be harsh but people need to think strategically. The odds are stacked against us, that&#39;s for sure, and if we can&#39;t even prevent ourselves from flipping out on a troll who is trying to get a reaction so he can have a good laugh with his buddies, we assuredly are not going to be able to overcome 50 years of brainwashing and propaganda techniques.  </p>

<p>I will reiterate that it is not hopeless but we do have a long hard road ahead. Everyone will have different involvement, but I know a lot here, including me, feel that we are here (on this planet) for a reason and that that reason is to help change the world. Before I got informed and involved about politics and all this, I never felt like I had any purpose, but I now feel that my purpose is to help make a better world. Some days I feel hopeless as hell, but I&#39;d rather die knowing I did everything I could than live some bullshit life of consumption waiting for my time to run out. I hope others feel the same. The thing is there are literally millions out there, whom if they only knew what was going on and  what&#39;s at stake, would be right along side with those of us actively trying to change things. Of course the majority, right now anyway, are happy (at least they think they are) with how things are, but their discontent will come with time. And we need to be there to help them along. Not call them stupid or shills but to be respectful and skeptical and helpful. I know there are assuredly millions out there who were just as depressed and disillusioned with the shithole that currently is this civilization, and it took me 20 years of living in it before I stumbled upon an area of information which opened my eyes to why things are the way they are (well it started off with psychology but once I got into conspiracy I really started to put to together the pieces), and it&#39;s up to us to help plant the seeds into others who have yet to come to this stuff. </p>

<p>&quot;Let me tell you why you&#39;re here. You&#39;re here because you know something. What you know you can&#39;t explain, but you feel it. You&#39;ve felt it your entire life, that there&#39;s something wrong with the world. You don&#39;t know what it is, but it&#39;s there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I&#39;m talking about? The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. You are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind.&quot; -Morpheus</p>

<p>This resonated with me so much that I almost feel like the director meant something more with the film (if you haven&#39;t watched it since you&#39;ve been into conspiracy, I recommend it–it&#39;s an entirely different experience)</p>

<p>The war starts and ends in our minds. If we believe it is hopeless, it is. If we believe it&#39;s not, it&#39;s not. Period. First and foremost, educate yourself. Your education never ends but at a certain point you get to where it is that you are fairly effective. Some people might reach this in a few months, others it takes longer.  It&#39;s trial and error (I recommend starting with Internet people so you don&#39;t make your family and friends think your crazy while you&#39;re still trying to sort fact from fiction), but there comes a point where you are full of geopolitical, sociological, historical, and economic knowledge that people start to take you seriously. I think I am just now getting there. Strategize–pick your battles, prioritize, calculate.  </p>

<p>For those interested, I&#39;d like to recommend some of my favorite sources that I&#39;ve stumbled across over the year I&#39;ve been into this stuff. </p>

<p>Barring the last 3 (whale is pretty far out but there is also gold there as well) these IME are &#39;safe havens&#39; so to speak from potential disinformation. Of course, everything must be looked upon with a critical mind, refraining from conclusions or judgement until you have done thorough research, and even then <em>always</em> being open to being wrong and re-evaluating your beliefs and priorities. This is something that is devoid in both the population as a whole, and much of conspiracy theory but it is absolutely paramount for any chance of a better world. Cheers. Thanks for reading. </p>

<p>Edit: sp (probably missed some but I am tired and will return tomorrow with more words and links if anyone is interested). </p>

<p>edit 2: link fixes and a little bit of a clarification</p>

<p>Edit 3: <strong>looks like this is getting a lot of down votes (haven&#39;t looked in res but I notice the score changing a lot) if anyone would like to discuss or critique it I would be glad to do so.</strong></p>

<p>Edit 4: major edits. I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about the disinformation stuff and I have modified my post to reflect my revamped opinion as best as accurately as possible. Also touched up on a couple of other things to try and make them more coherent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone here has a different idea of what will finally go down when the future gets dark. Personally I think we&#39;ll be defending our shores against China and Russia in WWIII and members of our own government and military will actively participate in our defeat. But after a good 10 years of being a conspiracy theorist, I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that it doesn&#39;t matter what happens and that your GF is right. </p>

<p>One day, perhaps, homeland security or aliens or UN soldiers or whatever is going to fall on us. The only things that will matter are your skills, your will power, your ability to act while afraid, and the strength of the men and women to the right and left of you. It won&#39;t matter if they thought 9/11 was an inside job or not, or if they think chemtrails or fluoride is harming us. All that will matter is whether they are selfish or selfless, paralyzed with fear or brave, able to defend themselves or unprepared. Also, I would quietly start storing some food, just in case. </p>

<p>So, in a sort of paradox, you should follow everyone&#39;s advice here. Get educated, inform others, protect your assets, tweet, pirate software?, but also live your life, love your family, eat, drink and be merry. Do all of these things, for they will prepare you physically, emotionally, and spiritually, and they will give you something worth fighting to protect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The system can only maintain control, if opposition to it, remains small and isolated.  The larger the number of aware people becomes, the more difficult it becomes for the system to remain in control of them.</p>

<p>Understand; they can only make martyrs or examples of people like Snowden and Manning, for as long as there are only one or two people engaging in said acts.  If it&#39;s only one or two people leaking or otherwise being subversive, then the government can simply kill or imprison them, tell the public that said individuals were terrorists or a threat to national security, and as a result, the public will go back to sleep.</p>

<p>If we really want to break the back of the current American/English fascism, the only real way we can do it, is by removing their capacity for plausible deniability; and the only way for that to happen, is when in terms of our actions, we truly all DO become Manning, Snowden, or Assange.</p>

<p>Solidarity in emotional terms is great, but in purely emotional terms, it is not enough.  We have to make starkly obvious the fact that the ratio of controllers to controlled is around 5:95, and the way we do that, is for every single one of us to perform nonviolent, but subversive acts.</p>

<p>Find out what bit torrent is.  Start using The Pirate Bay.  Download as many files from that web site as you can, upload files to it, and encourage everyone you know to do the same.  Not only will it benefit both you and them to do so, but having masses of people doing it will prove the inability of the government to enforce unjust law, in cases like file sharing.</p>

<p>We need to crash the system.  Don&#39;t be violent or genuinely immoral at all; but just create a scenario where, with all of the frivolous laws they have on the books now, there will never be any chance of them enforcing them all.  If it&#39;s a felony to wear Guy Fawkes masks now, then wear one.  Yes, a few of you will probably be caught and jailed, but you can be sure that it will be less than 1% of the entirety of us.  If marijuana is illegal where you are, then smoke it.</p>

<p>If you are worried about going to jail for this, then understand the fact that the more people do these things, the safer you make yourselves.  The system wants to scare you all into thinking that they can arrest every last one of you, when they themselves know that feasibly, they cannot.  So you <em>all</em> must subvert it, and you must do it in as many different places as you can, all at once.</p>

Additionally, this world we live in and think is &quot;real&quot; is only a shadow of the reality to come.

<p>People talk about the &quot;Illuminati&quot; and how they&#39;re going to defeat them somehow. Alex Jones says the same thing: &quot;we&#39;re on the march&quot;!

<p>Illuminati forces aren&#39;t a smoke-filled room of mere men but are in truth evil spirits who have influenced men and world events for centuries. Read the gospels. Jesus Christ spoke about this world kingdom. And if you read what Jesus said, you&#39;ll know the story of what will happen and how it will end.</p>

<p>I recommend listening to Malachi Martin on YouTube, he gave a very precise account of what is going on in this battle, he was a believer in the Fatima prophesy as am I. The pieces will fall into place when you listen to him talk about the New World Order from a Priests perspective.</p>

<p>I discovered this in 2010, took it more seriously in 2011 after I was saved:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually this whole &#39;messiah&#39; idea is all part of their plan.</p>

<p>You see, nowhere in the Old Testament does it say anything about any special guy who&#39;s going to swoop in and save the day while everybody else just sits on their asses and prays.</p>

<p>It&#39;s something like &quot;make life absolutely intolerable then let Bel Marduk or Obama or who gives a shit what you call him save the day and be worshipped in place of God.&quot; It comes with free drugs and brainwashing, and it&#39;s called Babylon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16047">Jeremiah 50:2</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tell among the nations and let it be heard and raise a standard; let them hear and do not hide it. Say, &quot;Babylon has been taken, Bel has been shamed, Merodach is dismayed, her images have been shamed, her idols have been dismayed.</p>
