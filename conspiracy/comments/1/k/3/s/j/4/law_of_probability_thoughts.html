<p>Just the exact opposite of that, actually. Events with a mathematical probability of 1 (or 100%, if you prefer) are not guaranteed to happen. They&#39;re very likely to happen, but as long as it&#39;s possible for them <em>not</em> to happen, they might not.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think the &quot;law of probability&quot; (by which I assume you mean statistical mechanics) says anything like what you think it says. One cannot make a case for the existence of space aliens based on mathematics. Just look at the infamous Drake equation to see why: There are too many unknowns. It&#39;s not possible to make any predictions when you have no data on which to base those predictions.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I have no idea what you were trying to say with &quot;regocnition&quot;, but what you describe cannot happen. First of all, an observer millions of light years away would be well outside the galaxy, and second it&#39;s quite impossible to resolve anything as small as an individual <em>planetary system</em> over such a distance, because of the diffraction of light.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If they were, when they started noticing signs of intelligent life, (which would have already been millions of years ago)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The consensus among experts is that nothing describable as &quot;signs of intelligent life&quot; goes back more than a few tens of thousands of years. Anatomically modern humanity only appeared about 200,000 years ago, and it was a long time after that that anything like socialization started to happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>IF they came to investigate, we would be millions of years more advanced than we are now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, that doesn&#39;t follow at all. First of all, it&#39;s quite impossible to cross a gulf of millions of light years in anything less than <em>hundreds</em> of billions of years. The universe isn&#39;t nearly old enough for anything to have crossed such a distance. And second, the phrase &quot;years more advanced&quot; rests on the assumption that there&#39;s such a thing as a linear progression from &quot;less advanced&quot; to &quot;more advanced&quot; over time, which is an idea that appears only in fiction, not anywhere in reality.</p>

<p>No, the definition of p=1 is <em>will happen</em>. It&#39;s guaranteed. If it&#39;s at all possible for it to not happen, then p≠1. In practice though, there are few things with p=1.</p>

<p>Everything else you said was correct though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely">Nope</a>. You have your facts quite wrong on this one.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the canonical example: I ask you to pick a <em>real number</em> (not an integer) between one and ten. How many real numbers are there between one and ten? There are <em>infinite</em> real numbers between one and ten. Therefore the probability of your picking any of them is exactly zero. That&#39;s math. By your interpretation, that means it&#39;s <em>impossible</em> for anybody to pick a real number between one and ten. But you can say &quot;seven and a half&quot; anyway without difficulty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Things with a P of 1 will happen.  Its a very basic concept, and I don&#39;t get how you don&#39;t understand that.  100% will happen means there is absolutely no doubt that this will happen.  Now if you mean that things we generally consider having a value of one actually have a value of 99.999... (although I don&#39;t think you do) then you are right, other wise you are absolutely wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It might be a &quot;very basic concept,&quot; but it&#39;s simply not true. That&#39;s a fundamental misunderstanding of probability. See the above example about picking a real number at random. It&#39;s mathematically &quot;impossible&quot; if you interpret probability the way you do, but it&#39;s trivial to demonstrate that it&#39;s not impossible at all in reality. Hence, your understanding of probability is wrong.</p>

<p>Another point you seem to have missed: 0.999… is exactly equal to 1.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m guessing you really just can&#39;t understand this, or are too prideful to admit you&#39;re wrong.  .99999... is commonly rounded up to 1 but it does necessarily equal one.  You can look up any academia source on probability and they will tell you things with a P value of 1 are guaranteed to happen.  As someone saod before, there are very few things with a P value of 1, which Is where I&#39;m guessing your misunderstanding is.  </p>

<p>So just go to any academic source, or ask a professor if you go to college.  Now, if you want to call all that wrong then you are too far gone anyways and its useless to try and help you understand.</p>

<p>No, 0.999… is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.999...">exactly equal to one</a>. There are <em>many</em> proofs, but here&#39;s the one I guess you&#39;ll find most clear:</p>

<p>x = 0.999…</p>

<p>10x = 9.999…</p>

<p>10x – x = 9.999… – 0.999…</p>

<p>9x = 9</p>

<p>x = 1</p>

<p>I already <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely">showed a layman&#39;s explanation of why this is false</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Huh. Well, okay, if that&#39;s how you feel at least it&#39;ll save us some time. You are entirely free to continue to be wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quantum mechanics basically expands the law of probability into a seemingly infinite realm of possibility and improbability. The law of probability can also say that something is probably improbable, and science nor math can explain the effects of consciousness on this infinite universe, but they know it does. It is so hard to fathom questions like this when you have gravity, black holes, and quantum energy connecting to a part of reality we have no scientific knowledge of whatsoever? I wonder how people know when a loved one has died without any physical transfer of the info like a phone call or email? </p>
