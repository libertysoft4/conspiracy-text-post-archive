Instead, this list will serve as evidence for <strong>the necessity of an independent Citizens Investigation</strong> into 9/11. The totality of circumstances are too great to ignore.</p>

<p><strong>Continuity of Government.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Building 7</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p>No plane hit building 7</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/wtc-082108.cfm">The National Institute of Standards and Technology concluded in their report on Building 7</a>: &quot;While debris impact from the collapse of WTC 1 initiated fires in WTC 7, the resulting structural damage had little effect in causing the collapse of WTC 7.&quot; </p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/factsheet/wtc_qa_082108.cfm">NIST admits that Building 7 is the first time a building over 15 stories tall has EVER collapsed due to fires.</a></p></li>

<a href="http://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf">NIST refuses to release data inputs for their computational collapse model</a>, saying it &quot;...might jeopardize public safety.&quot; </p></li>
<li><p>The model was built without physical evidence. &quot;In the month that lapsed between the terrorist attacks and the deployment of the [FEMA] BPAT team, a significant amount of steel debris—including most of the steel from the upper floors—was removed from the rubble pile, cut into smaller sections, and either melted at the recycling plant or shipped out of the U.S.&quot; -<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021128021952/http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/science/hsy77747.000/hsy77747_0.htm">Joseph Crowley, U.S. Congressman, Committee on Science, 2002. </a></p></li>
<li><p>NIST declined to test for chemical explosives used in demolition 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mxFRigYD3s">BBC reported the collapse hours before it happened, twice.</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=877gr6xtQIc">Experts such as Danny Jowenko agree it is a textbook case of controlled demolition, before being told the building collapsed on 9/11.</a>. Danny Jowenko, shown in the linked video, would die later in a suspicious car crash after his comments received mass attention.</p></li>
<li><p>Barry Jennings, the Deputy Director of the Emergency Services Department for the New York City Housing Authority, was trapped inside Building 7 when the first plane hit. <a href="http://wikispooks.com/wiki/9/11_Untimely_deaths#Barry_Jennings">He has repeatedly told his story of hearing explosions on the 20th and 22nd floor while trapped inside.</a> He died mysteriously in 2008, days before the release of the final NIST report. The cause of death has not been made public. </p></li>
<li><p>With rare exceptions, the media does not discuss building 7. </p></li>

<li><p>Silverstein Properties had planned to meet on September 11 on the 88th floor of one of the towers to &quot;discuss what to do in the event of a terrorist attack,&quot; but canceled the meeting late on September 10 &quot;because one participant could not attend.&quot; -<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/12/business/day-terror-insurers-reinsurance-companies-wait-sort-cost-damages.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Reinsurance%20Companies%20Wait%20to%20Sort%20Out%20Cost%20of%20Damage&amp;st=cse">NYT</a></p></li>

<li><p>&quot;So many unconnected dots, contradictions and implausible coincidences. Like the fact that NORAD was running an imaginary terrorist-attack drill called &quot;Vigilant Guardian&quot; on the same morning as the real-world attacks. At 8:40 a.m., when a sergeant at NORAD’s center in Rome, N.Y., notified his northeastern commander, Col. Robert Marr, of a possible hijacked airliner—American Flight 11—the colonel wondered aloud if it was part of the exercise. This same confusion was played out at the lower levels of the NORAD network.&quot;  - <a href="http://observer.com/2004/06/911-tapes-reveal-ground-personnel-muffled-attacks/">New York Observer</a></p></li>

<li><p>&quot;The Able Danger intelligence, if confirmed, is undoubtedly the most relevant fact of the entire post-9/11 inquiry. Yet the 9/11 Commission inexplicably concluded that it &quot;was not historically significant.&quot; This astounding conclusion--in combination with the failure to investigate Able Danger and incorporate it into its findings--raises serious challenges to the commission&#39;s credibility and, if the facts prove out, might just render the commission historically insignificant itself.&quot; -- <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/911/9-11_summary_articles/051117wsjfreehabledanger.htm">Former FBI Director Louis Freeh in the Wall Street Journal, 11/17/05</a></p></li>

<p>Analyst John Kinnucan, quoted by the San Francisco Chronicle, said &quot;I saw put-call numbers higher than I&#39;ve ever seen in 10 years of following the markets, particularly the options market.&quot;</p>

<p>Regarding the spike of unusual stock activity, Dylan Ratigan of Bloomberg says on Sept 20, &quot;This could very well be insider trading at the worst, most horrific, most evil use you&#39;ve ever seen in your entire life... This would be one of the most extraordinary coincidences in the history of mankind if it was a coincidence.&quot;</p>

<p>Germany&#39;s Bundesbank chief, Ernst Weltke tells Agence France Presse on Sept 22 that &quot;bizarre&quot; fiscal transactions prior to the attacks could not have been chalked up to coincidence. The stock activity &quot;could not have been planned and carried out without a certain knowledge, particularly heavy trading in oil and gold futures.&quot;</p>

<p>Ok I understand a lot better. I&#39;ll update the bulletpoint soon Edit: I thought that this discussion was referring to the mention of 2.3 trillion in another comment where I state:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Pentagon chose September 10th as the date to announce that 2.3 trillion was unaccounted for</p>

<p>Do you think that this quote should be removed, and do you think that the above statement accurately reflects the situation?</p>

<p>It&#39;s just that the way this has become part of the 9/11 activist canon - it&#39;s being framed in a way which invites a quick and effective rebuttal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Some thoughts</strong></p>

<p>Leaving all consideration to physical evidence behind, ignoring the ideas that the towers were brought down by bombs or thermite, the faults with official collapse explanations etc, the facts are undeniable: The Bush administration, FBI, CIA and more actively allowed the attacks to happen. I think most people can recognize that even if they don&#39;t consider themselves to be conspiracy theorists. Unfortunately, people aren&#39;t letting the implications sink in: If they let it happen before, they will let it happen again. And the next round of patriot acts and NDAAs will not be nearly as nice. </p>

<p>I propose that we make this our focus, as the evidence truly is empirical, and the consequences are the exact same as controlled demolition. People are also much more open to the idea. </p>

<p>Themes present in the evidence:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Bush administration and intelligence agencies repeatedly ignored warnings, and went as far as to sabotage investigations that might have uncovered the plot.</p></li>
<li><p>Various institutions and powerful people had tremendous motive to start wars and enact controlling legislation, and they have been shamelessly talking about it for decades.</p></li>
<li><p>There is lots of evidence of insider knowledge that the attacks would take place on 9/11</p></li>
<li><p>Evidence, both physical and information, were actively destroyed in the aftermath of the attacks.</p></li>
<li><p>The 9/11 commission was a complete farce</p></li>
<li><p>The narrative of bin Laden and the martyrdom-obsessed hijackers is a fabrication</p></li>
<li><p>There were multiple strong financial motives behind the attacks, as well as it as a convenient means to destroy evidence of corruption.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Michael Hastings talked about his ambition to cultivate an &quot;enemies list&quot; and it seems like you are following in his footsteps.

<li><p>&quot;Bin Laden was, though, a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies. Throughout the 80s he was armed by the CIA and funded by the Saudis to wage jihad against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan. Al-Qaida, literally &quot;the database&quot;, was originally the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen who were recruited and trained with help from the CIA to defeat the Russians. Inexplicably, and with disastrous consequences, it never appears to have occurred to Washington that once Russia was out of the way, Bin Laden&#39;s organisation would turn its attention to the west.&quot; - <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/08/july7.development">Robin Cook, former UK Foreign Secretary</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.millat.com/democracy/Foreign%20Policy/Briefing_Paper_english_11.pdf">The CIA created and armed the Mujahideen with 7.5 billion in 1979 </a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6033383.stm">the Saudis matched them dollar for dollar</a></p></li>
<li><p>Bin Ladens MAK, precursor to Al Qaeda, received funding from the ISI (which received funding from the CIA)</p></li>
<li><p>Bin Ladens tunnel complex, which he would later use after 9/11, was <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/911timeline/2001/pittsburghpostgazette092301.html">financed by the CIA</a></p></li>
<li><p>&quot;The Sudanese security services, he said, would happily keep close watch on bin Laden for the United States. But if that would not suffice, the government was prepared to place him in custody and hand him over, though to whom was ambiguous. In one formulation, Erwa said Sudan would consider any legitimate proffer of criminal charges against the accused terrorist.&quot; Their negotiations concluded as such: &quot;&quot;We said he will go to Afghanistan, and they [US officials!] said, &#39;Let him.&#39;&quot;- <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/18/AR2007111800593.html">Washington Post 2001</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/knew/etc/cron.html">Clinton declined to charge bin laden with a crime in 94</a> even though he had been clearly linked to the WTC bombings.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/nov/10/uk.davidshayler">MI6 paid large sums to al qaeda in Libya to assassinate gadhaffi in 96</a>. Gadaffi issued an INTERPOL arrest warrant for bin Laden in 98, US and UK downplayed it, likely because they had recently funded the libya cell. 5 months later, al qaeda bombed US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya</p></li>
<li><p>Al Qaeda and the US fought on the same side of the war in Kosovo and Bosnia. They recently repeated the process with Libya and Syria</p></li>
<li><p>According to the official story, bin Laden turned against the US after they occupied military bases in Saudi Arabia. This doesnt make sense, because: Scott Armstrong, at the time the top investigative reporter for the Washington Post, <a href="http://emperors-clothes.com/news/arming-i.htm">stated that the United States and Saudi Arabia had jointly conspired to covertly build $200 billion worth of military installations between the years 1979 and 1992</a>. Steve Coll, eminent Bin Laden biographer, states that the Binladen group received a multitude of these contracts, with the knowing intent to support to house US military personal during wars that may threaten Saudi territory. This was occuring at the same time that Osama was tight with his family and using Binladen group assets to build bases in Afghanistan. Of course he was aware of the business dealings between the company.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0110/01/lkl.00.html">Prince Bandar bin Sultan of Saudi Arabia, on Larry King Live</a>: &quot;In the mid-&#39;80s, if you remember, we and the United - Saudi Arabia and the United States were supporting the Mujahideen to liberate Afghanistan from the Soviets. He [Osama bin Laden] came to thank me for my efforts to bring the Americans, our friends, to help us against the atheists, he said the communists. Isn&#39;t it ironic?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>And then there is the fascinating story of Egyptian Ali Muhammed, only tangentially related but thoroughly interesting nonetheless.
He was a part of the fundamentalist military unit that assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Mohamed#In_the_United_States">In 1984, he was hired by the CIA</a>, though they claim that their relationship was short-lived. He would soon join the military and become a member of the Green Berets, and serve as a drill sergeant at Fort Bragg while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_Abouhalima">providing clandestine training to jihadists such as Mahmud Abaouhalima</a>, convicted perpetrator of the 1993 World Trade Center bombings. </p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Mohamed#In_the_United_States">He would take a short leave from his military duties and travel to Afghanistan in 1988 to assist the Mujahideen</a>, returning just months later.</p></li>
<li><p>In the early 1990&#39;s he would return to Afghanistan and began training jihadists with the skills he had learned at Fort Bragg. According to former FBI special agent <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline//////torture/interviews/cloonan.html">Jack Cloonan, in an interview with PBS</a>, his first training session included Osama bin Laden, as well as Ayman al-Zawahiri, the current leader of Al Qaeda.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Age-Sacred-Terror-Radical/dp/0812969847">Former Directors of Counter-terrorism at the National Security Council have alleged</a> that Muhammed took maps and training materials from Fort Bragg and used them to write the Al Qaeda terrorist training manual.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2009/11/29/fort-hood-the-ksm-trial-part-i-what-do-these-terrorism-stories-have-in-common/">His superior at Fort Bragg, Lt. Col. Robert Anderson, has stated that</a> “I think you or I would have a better chance of winning the Powerball lottery, than an Egyptian major in the unit that assassinated Sadat would have getting a visa, getting to California, getting into the Army and getting assigned to a Special Forces unit. That just doesn’t happen.”</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Al-Qaeda-terrorist-worked-with-FBI-Ex-Silicon-2861719.php#page-2">Elsewhere he stated that</a> &quot;It was unthinkable that an ordinary American GI would go unpunished after fighting in a foreign war,&quot; and that he assumed that Muhammed was sponsored by the CIA.</p></li>

<p>I&#39;d like to add my post which hopefully can be incorporated.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report">The official 500 page FBI report including East Rutherford Police Department report on the dancing Israelis arrested under suspicion of involvement and of pre knowledge of the attacks on 9/11, obtained in 2011 under a FOIA request.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.christopherketcham.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/Final%20PDF%20of%20CounterPunch%20article%20re%20Israelis%2001-29-07.pdf">Christopher Ketchum&#39;s report for Counter Punch detailing the circumstances around the suspects with addition information of 100&#39;s of Israeli agents suspected of trying to penetrate US law enforcement and agencies across the US (PDF.)</a></p>

<p>The Ketchum report details how close these Israelis lived to many of the hijackers and shows the addresses of both the hijackers and the Israelis. It&#39;s too coincidental that MOSSAD agents were living in some cases a few hundred metres away from the hijackers at the same time.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I think OIL / Minerals is just too naive to attack Iraq.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s absurd. It is crystal clear that wars are fought over resources, and the evidence of oil being a key for attacking Iraq is overwhelming. Didn&#39;t our politicians openly talk about using Iraq&#39;s oil to pay for the war?</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t the denial of petroleum by then the world&#39;s largest oil producer (the US) one of the critical reasons that Japan attacked the US at Pearl Harbor -- because the Japanese <em>had</em> <em>to</em> seize the oil in the-then &quot;Dutch East Indies&quot; (now Indonesia) and US forces in the Philippines/Guam and British forces in Asia would stop or hinder any such Japanese offensive? Japan was faced with economic decline or wage war; they chose war.</p>

<p>First, consider the US geo-political position in the world.</p>

<p>If you research the &quot;Silk Road Strategy&quot; bill that was debated in the US Congress in the 1990s, the US intended on replacing the centuries of Russian influence/hegemony in the energy-rich central Asia/Caspian Sea area with US hegemony. The US also wanted to establish complete hegemony over the Middle East.</p>

<p>The world peak oil production concept is important in this. Today everyone from the UN energy agency to Germany&#39;s gov&#39;t says the world has hit peak petroleum production. We&#39;re presently on a plateau where new types of oil production (e.g. tar/oil sands, shale, etc.) are only replacing old dying wells -- total worldwide production is not increasing by any significant amount and is nowhere near keeping up with demand, doubly so if the economy was growing.</p>

<p>By controlling the Middle East and Caspian basin, those two critical areas of petroleum production, the US de facto would have its hands around the throats of both Europe and China. US gov&#39;t nat&#39;l security guru Zbigniew Brzezinski focused on this in his famous book &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grand_Chessboard">The Grand Chessboard</a>&quot;.</p>

<p>Okay, so how could the US gov&#39;t do this? Such moves would require fighting a war or two. When Bush came to power, many of the people he appointed were previously involved in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_a_New_American_Century">Project for a New American Century</a> which famously said such a military offensive could not be undertaken with support of the American people without some sort of &quot;new Pearl Harbor&quot;.</p>

<p>9/11 provided the &quot;new Pearl Harbor&quot; and the month-plus-long series of anthrax attacks generated the fear of &quot;terrorism&quot; that allowed the people who run the US gov&#39;t to enact their strategy and to wage their wars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>30-50 years from now Oil will be a thing of the past. We will be using solar power to power all our energy needs. I&#39;m sure that the current Oil resource will be enough until we master the Solar power.</p>

<p>If this is the reasoning behind the attacks, then US is really not thinking very hard.</p>

<p>I think there&#39;s more to this than oil. Instead of focusing on Oil, lets try to think another reason why US want to claim the lands of Iraq.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the first time in a long time (maybe ever?), there is a single global superpower - the United States.  We effectively set up puppet leaders in South and Central America, our European allies do what we tell them to, and we successfully bought out Russia.  What&#39;s left? China and the Middle East. By maintaining a strong military presence in the Middle East, we prevent collusion of those Eurasian states. By keeping control of oil and keeping it priced on the dollar, we keep China below us.  9/11 was the catalyst that allowed us to invade where we needed to invade.</p>

<p>Also, a side note, fossil fuels are required for much more than energy. Solar panels can produce electricity, but essentially every other piece of infrastructure to transport and utilize that energy is currently dependent on fossil fuels.  From tires to toothbrushes, it is in everything!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been thinking this a lot. I watched Minority Report and was scared if our future becomes like that.</p>

<p>If there will be a technology similar to Minority Report where they can just read all your mind without even typing or saying it out loud. We are all fucked. We will become puppets. We are already puppets in this world but we still have artificial freedom. But if a technology like Minority report came to light, you can&#39;t even think. You&#39;ll work for the ones in power.</p>

<p>If we allow this NSA to happen. Then I don&#39;t know what will happen in the future of mankind. </p>

I brought up a question to one of my coworkers who worked private security at WTC2. He said that there were 2 floors that were off limits to his security crew. He said the FBI and CIA were known to occupy these floors. Can anyone find any reports to back this up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gish Gallop-</p>

<p>In written form, a Gish Gallop is most commonly observed as a long list of supposed facts or reasons, as a pamphlet or green ink web page, with a title that proudly boasts the number of reasons involved. The individual points must also be fairly terse, often to the point where each point individually is easy to refute because it simply proves nothing. But combined, a Gish Gallop might run into the same length as a multi-page essay running into thousands of words. This provides insight into the motives of the Galloper, as there seems to be some conflict between the scale of the Gallop and the shortness of the individual points. If brevity and ease of understanding were the aim (as suggested by short, easy-to-digest points) then they would be better off with a smaller number of points, like &quot;the best five reasons&quot; or &quot;the top ten arguments.&quot; These not only stick in the mind of a reader, but also form a core argument that can be expanded on. If, on the other hand, the aim was a coherent and thorough argument (as suggested by the word count), then the purpose would be best served by using the thousands of words expended in the Gallop to make a full essay, with points expanded and elaborated on to ensure they were thoroughly argued. By taking a curious middle ground, a Gish Gallop tries to create the illusion of authority and weight of evidence by sheer quantity alone, without any quality to back it up. To supporters, the illusion works, but those who disagree with the Galloper&#39;s points often find the repetitive assertions and non-explanations tedious to deal with. </p>

<p>Unless you saw something specific this IAmA doesn&#39;t explain the presence of thermite.<br/>
The paper they are citing <a href="http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/64959841/9119ProgressReport022912_rev1_030112webHiRes.pdf">Progress Report on the Analysis of Red/Gray Chips in WTC Dust</a> was written by James R. Millette, Ph.D. of MVA Scientific Consultants and Funds for the study were raised with help from members of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Randi_Educational_Foundation">James Randi Educational Foundation</a>.  </p>

<p>Compare the papers.  <a href="http://www.benthamscience.com/open/tocpj/articles/V002/7TOCPJ.htm">Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe</a>. Maybe you&#39;ll notice some spheres missing in one of them?  </p>

<p>In 2002 Millette also helped the EPA with this paper <a href="http://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?dirEntryId=65681&amp;amp;fed_org_id=770&amp;amp;SIType=PR&amp;amp;TIMSType=&amp;amp;showCriteria=0&amp;amp;address=nerl/pubs.html&amp;amp;view=citation&amp;amp;personID=17977&amp;amp;role=Author&amp;amp;sortBy=pubDateYear&amp;amp;count=100&amp;amp;dateBeginPublishedPresented=">CHARACTERIZATION OF THE DUST/SMOKE AEROSOL THAT SETTLED EAST OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER (WTC) IN LOWER MANHATTAN AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF THE WTC 11 SEPTEMBER 2001</a>    </p>

<p>We should inquire why a peer reviewed paper published in 2009 that found unreacted thermite in the dust of the WTC would only be investigated (three years later) by the <em>The James Randi Educational Fund</em>?  Shouldn&#39;t the entire scientific community be interested or involved?  What&#39;s keeping people from scrutinizing what Niels H. Harrit, Jeffrey Farrer, Steven E. Jones Kevin R. Ryan, Frank M. Legge, Daniel Farnsworth, Gregg Roberts, James R. Gourley and Bradley R. Larsen found?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, the observation of plane trajectories, speeds and impacts being inconsistent with what is possible in reality is as esoteric as discussing gravitational acceleration for WTC7.   as I said, Northwoods gives a good precedent for this, and E4B&#39;s and IR lasers complicate things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no, the lamppost stuff isn&#39;t related to anything other than the fact that the cabbie seems to admit the scene was staged and others are saying there were two planes - at least two different paths.</p>

<p>the official  &#39;video&#39; 5 frames is inconclusive, but certainly doesn&#39;t appear to be a passenger jet either.  85 videos and that&#39;s all we get?</p>

<p>my feeling after watching the first link, the 3 hour video - watch a bit at a time it&#39;s not so bad.. is that two objects were involved.  One impacted to the left and in front of the hole that we see.  the hole is made by a bunker buster.. really it was kevlar reinforced to withstand such attacks.. only a bunker buster would do for the most important military building in USA</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so what.  these objections can be handled one at a time.</p>

<p>first, TV overlay was already in use in games.<br/>
second, there are only 3 or 4 shots from helicopters  for all networks to consider<br/>
third, videos and photos were confiscated and returned in some cases altered (Evan Fairbanks)  some photos were taken from video stills and passed off.<br/>
fourth.  many witnesses describe something different than passenger jet<br/>
fifth..  the media that day can be heard correcting witnesses that they did see a passenger plane when they maintain otherwise.</p>

<p>I&#39;d rather suffer through every question and inconsistency than believe lies I&#39;m fed mindlessly.</p>

<p>true there is one video that I found that wasn&#39;t confiscated or altered, so not all of them were.   the one video I found is from very far away, recorded on a phone or something and shows a strange feature that could be an IR targeting laser.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>not live, but delayed by some seconds.  and yes I think it&#39;s possible that 4 feeds could have been altered in those seconds.</p>

<p>look at all the available footage and decide for  yourself.  there&#39;s no way for me to get other evidence for you.</p>

<p>was it a missile?  even a plane can be considered a missile.  it was certainly a projectile of some sort.  one that easily penetrated the steel frames of the building and reinforced walls of pentagon and exploded inside.  much like a global hawk or JASSM might behave.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been thinking this a lot. I watched Minority Report and was scared if our future becomes like that.</p>

<p>If there will be a technology similar to Minority Report where they can just read all your mind without even typing or saying it out loud. We are all fucked. We will become puppets. We are already puppets in this world but we still have artificial freedom. But if a technology like Minority report came to light, you can&#39;t even think. You&#39;ll work for the ones in power.</p>
