        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I submitted this letter through his website yesterday. Everyone needs to speak the fuck up!:</p>

<p>Hello Mr. Rand,</p>

<p>I&#39;m a big supporter of yours and a libertarian as well. In the last few weeks I&#39;ve been very stressed out and am losing sleep. The NSA is clearly violating the Constitution and nothing is being done about it. No one in Congress is taking a stand. WHAT IS GOING ON!</p>

<p>Today I read a story about a company called Lavabit. It&#39;s a small email provider that keeps messages privately encrypted. The NSA SHUT IT DOWN because the owner of the company wouldn&#39;t hand over the content of the emails. That to me is a violation of his 4th amendment rights and I&#39;d cite Katz vs. United as legal proof of that. I own a small business. How can I be sure now that mine won&#39;t be shut down by way of a SECRET court? There&#39;s no more trust.</p>

<p>So if that&#39;s actually not the case, and there&#39;s some rational legal explanation for all of this, LET ME HEAR IT! Make the rulings PUBLIC! It&#39;s a domestic matter between a COMPANY and the GOVERNMENT. Why is it a secret? How am I supposed to trust a legal decision if I can&#39;t hear it? This is ridiculous and scary. This is what real terror is. I shouldn&#39;t have to be afraid of my own representatives. So Mr. Paul, please Repeal the Patriot Act. PLEASE!</p>

<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion, Rand Paul does&#39;nt deserve support. He is known to <a href="http://youtu.be/07MH-WhrlK8">flip-flop</a> on important issues. </p>

<p>That being said, if we had a governement full of Rand/Ron Pauls on the right wing, and Elizabeth warrens on the left, I think the world would be a lot better off. </p>

<p>I think that politicians should have serious consequences for campain lies, smething more serious than getting voted out with an awesome pension. </p>

<p>Sure, it&#39;s just a gesture essentially, but if there a cause deserving of measurable effort, OP&#39;s actions carry exponentially more weight and influence towards something positive, rather than possibly dissuade interest in publicizing dissent, which is what remarks like yours are more likely to do.</p>
