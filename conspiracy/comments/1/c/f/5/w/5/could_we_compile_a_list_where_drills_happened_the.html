<p>It is from the State of Connecticut&#39;s website which listed a FEMA event occurring at the same time on the same day and in same state (Bridgeport is around 18 miles away from Sandy Hook) as the Sandy Hook shooting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I&#39;m saying that your source about Sandy Hook is literally nothing. I did bring up facts. Hurricane Sandy affected a lot of people in Connecticut and FEMA played an active role in helping restore power and stability in the state. </p>

<p>The link that you posted is a schedule that FEMA used in order to show the classes available in Bridgeport, CT. If you actually read to the bottom of the link, you would see that it was only a class and nothing more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The target audience for this course is local and state emergency managers and planners, Child Services Agencies, NGO’s, Child Care Providers, Schools, and Faith-based Organizations.</p>

<ol>
<li>As of October 1, 2012 anyone applying for FEMA courses must obtain a FEMA Student Identification (SID) number. For more information and to obtain a SID go to:  <a href="https://cdp.dhs.gov/femasid/">https://cdp.dhs.gov/femasid/</a></li>
</ol>

<p>You will need this number to complete the course application form (119-25-1) that will be filled out at the beginning of the class.  FEMA certificates will be mailed to participants after completion of this course.</p>

<p>Even in the text that you quoted before</p>

<p>It&#39;s just an educational course about disaster relief. It has nothing to do with school shootings. FEMA doesn&#39;t even relate to school shootings at all! They are focused on Hurricane Sandy and helping people in the tri-state area get back on their feet. </p>

<p>I think my anger is perfectly justified because you&#39;re being a fucking idiot. You have no evidence other than a fucking schedule to a FEMA course miles away from the actual event. </p>

<p>You&#39;re right. I am imterpreting something. I&#39;m interpreting that you are a fucking idiot. Who in their right minds posts a link to a <em>schedule of a disaster relief course</em> and thinks that is enough evidence to say there is a possible conspiracy?</p>

<p>Oh god! A FEMA event at the same time and same date as a shooting? Did you also realize that those courses happen all the time?</p>

Lets say there is on average 1 major terrorist attack a year. There is a 1 in 30 chance that the drill and the attack will fall on the same day. Now multiply 1/30 by the number of major cities that drills have been run in before. Now multiply the new number by the number of probable scenarios that could take place, bombing, shooting, airliner,subway, whatever they train for ect. Now you are left with a pretty large number. Now factor in that this not just some extreme anomaly of probability, but has taken place several times over the past 15 years. So you tell me the name for people who deny statistics, and I will tell you the name for people who notice a few coincidences. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Source?</p>

<p>Also assuming you do a drill every week, why would you do a drill during an actual event? </p>

<p>I mean a drill is: gather in this park, wait till something happens (which you planned for practice) , then follow protocols. </p>

<p>Whereas an event is: gather in this park, wait till something happens (could be anything or nothing, be ready) , then follow protocols.</p>

<p>To some extend they are mutually exclusive. If you are securing an event then that&#39;s already a drill by itself. Why would you then have an actual drill?</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m confused about this whole drill thing. Basically I&#39;m under the assumption that when you go to secure an event, that is called &quot;working&quot; and not &quot;having a drill&quot;.</p>

<p>It does seem odd that there are always drills during real events lately, but I don&#39;t see what the point would be, unless it is either a) to pull away the potentially helpful forces and have them otherwise occupied elsewhere, or b) some kind of sick calling card of the government for false flag attacks.</p>

In turn, faulty logic comes in to play (in order to be &quot;first&quot; or due to emotions). </p>

<p>Given that emergency drills are a regular occurrence, and disasters are not a regular occurrence, what other regular occurrences could you relate disasters to? It&#39;s not a coincidence that school shootings only seem to happen between 7AM and 3PM.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be great to have some info as to the frequency of drills in different types of settings and not just &quot;drills occur a lot.&quot; It would help that sort of rebuttal make a stronger impact on the correlation between disaster and drill. Also, I think you&#39;re misrepresenting the way that people focus on the connection between the two things; it&#39;s more about the drill being the same sort of event as the real disaster not that there is a drill happening. If you know that&#39;s what they are saying and you think it&#39;s silly, you just didn&#39;t make your argument clear. Saying that they are just connection mundane activities, such as school time, to a disaster is not at all what the drill/disaster people are saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Until Sept. 11, 2001, NORAD conducted four major exercises a year. Most included a hijack scenario, but not all of those involved planes as weapons. Since the attacks, NORAD has conducted more than 100 exercises, all with mock hijackings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2004-04-18-norad_x.htm">source</a> - just the first link on a google search. So the likelyhood of the kind of drill that was going on during 9/11 was roughly 1:91, except that particular drill was said to be &quot;not a regularly scheduled drill,&quot; which makes it even more suspicious to me. </p>

<p>But yeah, to find out if this is coincidence or not someone would have to do much better research - find out how many drills of each type are performed and weigh it against terrorist events that happen, taking into account the similarity of the drills to the events, the institutions involved, the locations and distances apart, etc. </p>

<p>It would make an extremely interesting series of blog posts, if someone much less lazy than I were to take it on. But confirmation bias would have to be very strictly accounted for and neutralized. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>as ketomine said, &quot; it does make sense that you&#39;d practice for things like this when there are hundreds of people around.&quot; is there a more logical place to train for an attack than a place where an attack could actually happen? </p>

<p>Maybe this is a matter of interpretation. I do not interpret drills as being as significant/absurd/unusual as some might. I am not sure as to the exact frequency, but it would be reasonable to assume they happen more often than lethal attacks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct that drills are not an unusual occurrence, but the coincedience of a drill running the same scenario as an actual disaster taking place is what people are pointing out. It&#39;s important to not get carried away, but these disasters are extraordinary situations so we ought to look towards these strange coinciding events. There is a transcript from 911 where a f15 pilot(or whatever the plane is, I&#39;m not good with military names) has to ask the air controller giving him info if the report of planes being hijacked was part of the drill or real life. In that situation there were drills that followed the exact same format as the attacks. It isn&#39;t a smoking gun, but it&#39;s strange. There is a good list in the comments above, if you want a better idea of wht I&#39;m talking about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This very much. What exactly does a &quot;drill&quot; mean? Sure its a coincidence, but how does a drill make it a government plan? What is very plausible though is they had some indication of a bomb threat at the Boston marathon (with the amount of security/intelligence in the US i dont see how you could not have any indication) but not enough to shut down the event. So they had bomb sniffing dogs out there to try to find the possible bombs but were to late. Why dont they admit this? Most likely because they are still looking for those responsible and dont want to give out how much prior information they have to the terrorists so they dont know how much information they have about them, or how they got that information. As for the other ones on this list above, all the school shootings could be the same explanation, along with the london bombings. The 9/11 drills were fucking ANNUAL and happen every year at that time, and had nothing to do with passenger planes and buildings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely see where you are coming from. During the Sandy Hook incident, there was a link to DHS&#39;s calendar of events and they had some training exercise for dealing with children and tragedies. </p>

<p>I can understand training exercises for major events that involve a large gathering of people, but Sandy Hook doesn&#39;t fit that criteria. If it was a &quot;spur of the moment&quot; tragic accident with no significance to date or time. </p>

You can either cancel one of the biggest annual events in the USA based on what you <strong>expect</strong>, or try to thwart an attack and pretend you didn&#39;t know anything.

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly as brutal as this attack was it seems like someone didn&#39;t want to go through with it at the last minute and disarmed a few of the bombs, or it just didn&#39;t go as horrifically as they planned, either way I think they expected it to be a lot worse than it was. Not that it wasn&#39;t fucking awful either way. I hate the fact that when you question the official story you&#39;re seen as a person who has no sympathy for the people who were hurt and killed, I feel terribly for the people involved and their families and that&#39;s what really breaks my heart the most. </p>

<p>Most people just aren&#39;t comfortable thinking anything different than what the media portrays because that would be saying our country knows something that we don&#39;t and possibly may have perpetrated such an attack and that is such an unsettling feeling, even for me.</p>

<p>Also as for your sick sandy hook suggestions, the organization has a drill literally every 3rd day. Not to mention with the amount of organizations who are in the safety business, you could have a event where the president is being attacked by aliens made of jello, and SOMEONE SOMEWHERE would probably be having a drill about it.</p>

<p>Not to mention, exactly what use would a drill have? Considering the goal of these &#39;conspiracies&#39; is to hurt and kill people to get laws you want passed, surely NOT having a drill would aid their cause, causing higher casualties and a more pressing &#39;need&#39; for whatever thing the nutters on this website are against today.</p>

<p>Yet another case of morons with aids who got touched a little too many times as a kid looking for anything that might possibly maybe be related to whatever pedo sick conspiracy they have in their minds today.</p>

They want to see how fast people use social media, internet, cellular. It was mentioned several times how social media &quot;broke the news&quot; before most news stations.<br/>

They will use the disguise of drills, emergencies, events to utilize DHS&#39;s control over social media, internet, mobile <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWyq9RSO0X8">4:14 into the video</a>.

The honest cop can be told that the &quot;terrorist&quot; is part of a drill, therefore the &quot;terrorist&quot; is let go! Cute, huh?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could also be used to put a bunch of dishonest cops on the ground, and they could very well be part of the terrorism also.  A drill lets the cops in the area be hand selected beforehand, no &quot;first responders&quot; in the area.</p>

<p>It also gives them a &quot;valid&quot; reason to be there beforehand.. you know, calmly walking on the roof.</p>

So they will say, were running a drill that a school shooting is going to take place, so when the shooting occurs there is a lot of confusion as to weather this is part of a  drill or not. It allows the people in charge to control the flow of information temporarily and clean up anything that needs cleaning up. </p>

<p>These are the cops that are part of the drills.  It lets them hand select the ones that will be on the ground, to ensure that nothing &quot;goes wrong.&quot;  It also gives them a valid reason to be in the area looking suspicious beforehand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>SHHHHH, that sounds like SHRILL TALK!</p>

<p>Everyone knows the fact that the Boston Marathon has had these drills year after year (at least 6 years) is all just a huge cover up because EVERYTHING BAD THAT HAPPENS EVER is a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Stop using your logic, logic is for reptilian jew shrills!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct that drills are not an unusual occurrence, but the coincedience of a drill running the same scenario as an actual disaster taking place is what people are pointing out. It&#39;s important to not get carried away, but these disasters are extraordinary situations so we ought to look towards these strange coinciding events. There is a transcript from 911 where a f15 pilot(or whatever the plane is, I&#39;m not good with military names) has to ask the air controller giving him info if the report of planes being hijacked was part of the drill or real life. In that situation there were drills that followed the exact same format as the attacks. It isn&#39;t a smoking gun, but it&#39;s strange. There is a good list in the comments above, if you want a better idea of wht I&#39;m talking about. </p>
