        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Come on fellow Internauts, we can no longer sit back and retard about, insulting each other and trolling the people the most like us in the world! Revolution is at our doorstep. Look at all the information. We know this government is corrupt, we know these wars have not been for our freedom. We are not that stupid.</p>

<p>This revolution has a chance to be non-violent. The nature of our internet has supplied us with the ONLY non-violent means of revolution, the spread of information. If we do not spread information now, if we allow more of these military/police occupations of our cities, we will have to result to violence and death to stop this machine.</p>

<p>Stop fighting with your fellow Internauts. Stop fighting in circles over whether or not the legless man is an actor. This is irrelevant. Spread the real news. Don&#39;t be condescending, you cannot enlighten someone you are insulting. We need to infect our society with the truth.</p>

<p>Focus all of your efforts on converting those you can, not fighting with those who are arguing for the sake of an argument. Spread this information to your family. Your friends. Do not worry if they dismiss and demonize you. This is the defense mechanism built into our society to fight anything not spoon-fed through mass media. Understand they are brainwashed. Help them see the light, do not berate them for being in the dark.</p>

<p>The world is changing for the better. Evil is being routed from it. The internet has brought a change to this world, and we need a governing body that is made with the internet in mind, not one made in the 1800&#39;s when the internet was beyond a pipe dream. We are run by those who have no understanding of this internet, and thus no understanding of those who have been raised on it.</p>

<p>Spread the truth! Do not fight those who you cannot help! Ignore disinfo! You are smart enough! Go to other sites, go to your co-workers. The information revolution is upon us, we cannot fail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there is <em>any</em> hope, it is with the internet. But it&#39;s important to note that our chances our slim. Sitting around saying &#39;don&#39;t worry, the internet will save us&#39;, is the last thing any of us should be doing. We need to think, and learn, while it&#39;s still legal. And spread information while still remaining credible while it&#39;s still legal. Pulling an Alex Jones with your friends is not going to do anything but make them think you&#39;re crazy. Show them the documentaries and books that opened your eyes. Link them to the dozens (I hope you get you your information from more than one conspiracy site/alt news site), hopefully hundreds, of organizations whose information you analyze to form your own opinions. Show them the histories not talked about anymore (operation north wood, gulf of tonkin, CIA cocaine running, etc). &#39;conspiracy&#39; is a very fragile topic, and if you come out with the opinions before the facts, you may lose your credibility forever for those who are too indoctrinated to question things for themselves. Stay strong and keep questioning <em>EVERYTHING</em> disinfo is at an all time high. Don&#39;t trust me. Don&#39;t trust anyone. Think for yourself, and defragment dissonances!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, we should watch teenagers&#39; YouTubes, produced by people hundreds or thousands of miles away from the events, who haven&#39;t spoken to anyone even remotely connected to the event, and people like Alex Jones, who would have no income if it weren&#39;t for hysterics about &quot;false flags.&quot;  Oh, and anonymous blog posts, too.  Those are reliable.</p>

<p>Right?</p>

<p>&quot;Corporate&quot; media is motivated by advertising sales, which are motivated by ratings.  If you don&#39;t think a true, verifiable, story about a government conspiracy such as the people here always suggest would draw massive ratings you are delusional.  </p>

Then some nurses commented how the guy was full of shit.

    <div class="md"><p>No, but really.  If this is a false flag operation, then whose flag is being falsely flown?</p>

<p>I mean, let&#39;s assume that the conventional wisdom of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is correct and that this attack was staged. A staged terrorist attack isn&#39;t <em>automatically</em> a false flag operation -- if the purpose of the attack was to make the government look good, then that wouldn&#39;t be a false flag operation.  I&#39;m not sure there is a term for that, but a false flag it is not.  A false flag operation has a specific purpose: To frame a specific enemy in order to justify &quot;retaliation&quot; against that enemy for their supposed &quot;crimes&quot;.</p>

<p>Now, we know that the FBI is blaming a pair of Muslim Chechen brothers.  The government hardly needs to make muslims look bad, it&#39;s not like Americans have forgotten 9/11.  And were not going to be going to war with Chechnya, a small terrorist attack like this isn&#39;t going to justify that -- especially not with Americans tired of killing Muslims after 10+ years of it, not with North Korea on the horizon, not with Iran on the field.</p>

<p>Using the term &quot;false flag&quot; to mean &quot;staged&quot; is just dumb.  It&#39;s so &quot;Look at me, look at me, I discovered a new buzzword!&quot;</p>

<p>Just dumb.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t use this to solidify your point. Yes, many of us (including you) have been following conspiracies and conspiracy theories for years, but doing so doesn&#39;t make the incorrect application of a term correct, just because we&#39;ve been using it so long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the entire government is bad... I actually think many people in our political system are good, I&#39;d wager many of them are responsible for a lot of leaks. They see they can&#39;t change it, so they save up evidence. Supposedly there is a 600 page report about Obama/Bush war crimes, with very solid evidence. </p>

<p>I think our country was made with the ability to impeach it&#39;s leader for a reason. We need more transparency in the system, other than that it is a very effective democracy. 
edit: similar to what happened in Germany after the fall of the Nazi regime.</p>

<p>If &quot;they&quot; controlled everything, then they wouldn&#39;t even bother to suppress the truth - the fact that it&#39;s still clandestine indicates to me that there is a hope.</p>

<p>My theory is that voting third party is the key.  Clearly R and D aren&#39;t going to help us;  but I&#39;m heartened by the tremendous and consistent cry of &quot;You&#39;ll waste your vote!&quot; that always comes up, even though if you are not in a &quot;swing state&quot; then voting third-party has provably more changes of effecting actual change.</p>

<p>Most people in government are normal people.   Like all people, some will violate laws.  I want to make sure all government actions eventually become known to the public, and that no action committed by our government will stay hidden from history forever.  </p>

<p>Sometimes info coming out will hurt or ruin a person&#39;s career.  A plan to reduce pollution wastes money and doesn&#39;t work.  Sometimes info coming out  that will erode faith in government&#39;s ability to properly deal with an issue.  A valve that failed would have been caught if it was inspected in line with regulations.  I just want all info be made public so the citizenry is better informed about what ideas work and what don&#39;t.</p>

<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cwn5s/boston_massacre_an_inside_job_nsa_censoring_this/">Reddit and NSA censoring evidence of a FRAME JOB.</a></p>

<p><strong>BOSTON BOMBING IS A FRAME JOB</strong>, They are screwing the government by coercing the over reaction we saw, using on the take cops and moles in positions of authority, the whole thing looks exactly like a gang-stalking frame job, right down to the &quot;The FBI is Watching Us&quot; and &quot;Taxi Cab Confession.&quot;**  Four months ago, in telling my story, those were the names of two of the posts.  <em>Verbatim.</em></p>

<hr/>

<p>A taxi driver comes forward with a story that a full week ago, he received a full confession in his cab the day of the bombing.  He&#39;s taken seriously by who?  Cab drivers are notorious employees of organized crime and the CIA. I&#39;m a victim of gang stalking, and I&#39;ve <strong>personally</strong> be threatened by so many cab drivers I can&#39;t count them on my fingers.  Afterwords, get this, I was framed for a crime, <strong>wake up</strong>.  This <em>stinks</em> of a frame job.</p>

<p>My story is below, but you don&#39;t have to believe me.  In the links below its <strong>clear</strong> that TAXI drivers have been working for organized crime for decades.   Gang stalking victims have been complaining about it, and I wrote about it <strong>months ago</strong>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I&#39;ve personally witnessed a <strong><a href="http://illuminatiandvatican.com/2013/02/the-hidden-empire.html">vast conspiracy</a></strong> which specifically included the use of a significant number of taxi drivers, and <strong><a href="http://illuminatiandvatican.com/2013/04/false-flags-police-foreknowledge-and.html">corrupt FBI agents</a></strong> who were co-conspirators in an attempt to silence and discredit me.  These taxi drivers appeared to be communicating to a centralized authority via some covert means, most likely mind control.  I specifically wrote about taxi drivers being involved in a <a href="http://illuminatiandvatican.com/2013/01/taxi-cab-confession.html"><strong>conspiracy months ago</strong></a>.  Ironically, this post is called <strong><em>Taxi Cab Confession</em></strong>.</p>

<p>There&#39;s been <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/taxi-drivers-killed-mexico-were-drug-cartels-involved-436066"><strong>recent news linking Taxi drivers to drug cartels</strong></a>  and <a href="http://usopenborders.com/2012/05/presented-to-12-taxi-drivers-in-nl-accuse-them-of-working-for-los-zetas/">12 Taxi Drivers accused of <strong>working for Los Zetas</strong> last May.</a></p>

<p>This conspiracy is real, and from what I have gathered a significant number of taxi drivers in major metropolitan areas are working with this syndicate.  This has been known since the 80&#39;s, when publicly available information disclosed that the Columbian drug cartels used a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cali_drug_cartel#Counterintelligence"><strong>network of Taxi drivers for surveillance</strong></a>.  These cartels, along with the Italian Mafia, are the main <strong>enforcement arm</strong> of what popular culture calls <strong>the Illuminati</strong>, they have globalized just like the rest of the world, and now work in concert with a faction of the US government. </p>

<p>It is very likely that these attacks have been caused by <strong>the Illuminati</strong>, framing the two brothers.  This is their modus operandi, <a href="http://illuminatiandvatican.com/2013/02/the-fbi-is-watching-us.html"><strong>watching people for significantly long periods of time</strong></a> (<strong>Ironic title, The FBI is watching us.</strong>) with faux surveillance, and then framing them.  In addition, I have <a href="http://illuminatiandvatican.com/2013/01/up-yellow-brick-road-to-national.html"><strong>witnessed Federal agents working with this conspiracy</strong></a>, and it&#39;s very possible that the FBI surveillance was intentionally done as a cover operation, by corrupt agents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well when 100% of incidents get touted as a false flag, it gets more notoriety. I took  a shit this morning and someone already labeled a false flag shit.</p>

<p>When I run a red light, its a false flag, all those murders in chicago? false flags. That rainy day you were supposed to go to the beach? false flag.</p>

<p>That thing that probably going to happen next month? clearly a false flag.</p>

<p>False flag, say it enough and people start to false, think that flag maybe false flag has some false flagginess to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or maybe we ARE being lied to, and the instant anything happens the first thing we do is scrutinize it to see the truth? The media is not on our side, they are liars feeding us the slop they are told to. We have to take information gathering in our own hands. </p>

<p>Sure, sometimes we follow a bad lead, but ultimately this type of scrutiny of our governing body and police force is the only thing we can do to ensure our best interests are in mind. If we&#39;re wrong, and EVERYTHING is 100% copacetic, the majority of us will very quickly move past this, but until we are given adequate evidence we will question everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing, though - we need to be very careful to only expose our best information to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>For example, when I talk to people about 9/11, I never ever use the term false flag - if for no other reason than I&#39;m really not sure that it&#39;s a false flag or not.</p>

<p>Instead, I point to things that are difficult to explain from the official story - even mostly from .gov sites.  Why didn&#39;t they start the investigation for over a year?  Why did they allow all the physical evidence to be removed (shipped to China!) before the investigation even started?  Why did that investigation run out of money?  Why did they spend $45m on the 9/11 investigation, $90m on the Challenger investigation - but $180m on Monica Lewinsky?  Why are reports of where Cheney was and what he was doing so varied?</p>

<p>Even worse - why did no one lose their job?  Look at all the evidence that was gathered before 9/11 - and ignored - again, according to the official 9/11 commission.  Look at the series of mistakes - &quot;Al Qaeda determined to attack in US&quot;;  &quot;You&#39;ve covered your ass now&quot; - and yet everyone got promoted!</p>

<p>And so far, I&#39;m only dealing in data from <a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf">the official report</a>.</p>

<p>You can go a long, long way on this stuff and never have to say anything that isn&#39;t part of the official stories. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also important, because people have to think for themselves.  You cannot do their thinking for them - you have to lead them to the facts and then step back or they won&#39;t believe you.</p>

<p>If you just show them undeniable, official facts and then ask why it&#39;s supposedly so, if they start to think about it then they themselves will dig up the other information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, the bulk of your questions are based on false-premises, plus how does one get from having a sense of incredulity to being able to form verifiable conclusions?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why didn&#39;t they start the investigation for over a year?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The FBI and CIA investigations went into full effect the moment the second plane struck the South Tower. (The &#39;9/11 Commission Report&#39; is <strong>not the &quot;investigation&quot; into 9/11</strong> - its a brief summary of events with recommendations for the prevention of another &#39;9/11&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did they allow all the physical evidence to be removed (shipped to China!) before the investigation even started?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False-premise; not <strong>all</strong> of the steel was removed just the majority of it since what would be the point of going over <em>every</em> bit of rubble?  The &#39;controlled demolition&#39; hypothesis is easily ruled out due to a) the collapse of towers 1 &amp; 2 don&#39;t even resemble a controlled demolition and b) there are no audible explosions (an expected trait of controlled demolitions).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did that investigation run out of money?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re talking about the 9/11 Commission Report then this question is malformed and irrelevant since, as previously mentioned, the 9/11 Commission Report is not the &quot;investigation&quot; into 9/11.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did they spend $45m on the 9/11 investigation, $90m on the Challenger investigation - but $180m on Monica Lewinsky?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I fail to see the relevance of this question.  What arbitrary figure would you expect or be happy with?  If they had spent $180m on it would it change your opinion about what happened on 9/11?  If the answer is no then why bother asking?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are reports of where Cheney was and what he was doing so varied?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again I don&#39;t see the relevance.  What are we supposed to deduce from this seeming anomaly?  How does someone get from &quot;I&#39;ve found an anomaly&quot; to &quot;I have uncovered a conspiracy&quot;?</p>

<p>&quot;Al Qaeda determined to attack in US&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;ve read this memo then it should be clear there was no <em>actionable</em> intelligence included in it.  There are no specific plans mentioned so would it be rational to expect the government to indefinitely shut down the FAA based on it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s also important, because people have to think for themselves. You cannot do their thinking for them - you have to lead them to the facts and then step back or they won&#39;t believe you.</p>

<p>Well said.</p>

<p>No &quot;arbitrary figure&quot; - that&#39;s why I <em>compared</em> it to other famous investigations to give a benchmark, yes?</p>

<p>The 9/11 Commission report starts off with apologies for not having been able to finish their work due to lack of money.  Why is Monica Lewinsky worth spending four times as much money on as the greatest crime every committed in the United States?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who should lose their jobs and for what reason(s)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an astonishingly irresponsible attitude - a slovenly willingness to accept any incompetence, no matter how great, from your public servants.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with the PDB.  This was very clear - Al Qaeda was planning to hijack planes and to <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/August_6,_2001_Presidential_Daily_Brief">attack federal buildings in New York City</a>.  I&#39;m curious as to how much more &quot;actionable&quot; you would want a warning...</p>

<p>Was the FAA warned?  No.  In fact, when the first stewardesses called their bosses, they thought they were joking.</p>

<p>Was NORAD warned?  No.  </p>

<p>The individuals within the FBI who should have passed the warning to the FAA and NORAD should be sacked.  If there was no system at all to pass hijacking warnings to the FAA, then the person in charge should have been sacked - all the way to the top if needs be.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s indeed look at NORAD.  The US has spent countless billions on them, and they have a guarantee to intercept planes that stop responding within 14 minutes - something they successfully did a dozen times a year before 9/11, nearly always with no incident (remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_South_Dakota_Learjet_crash">this</a> where they had a chase jet up in less than 10 minutes?)</p>

<p>But this time they fail four out of four times to do their job. Four out of four!</p>

<p>Why?  Read the 9/11 Commission report - there was a drill, there was a miscommunication, but when you sum it up, <em>it was a series of fuckups.</em></p>

<p>Now you know, when a rookie news anchor says, &quot;Fuck,&quot; on the air, it&#39;s not a big deal, but this was a disaster that killed thousands, and the unbelievably expensive smoke alarm that is NORAD failed to operate, basically because they&#39;d &quot;turned it off for testing&quot;.</p>

<p>What good is a safety system you turn off a few times a year?  </p>

<p>Whoever was in charge of that should be sacked.  Indeed, I&#39;d say that this is a symptom of a sick organization that needs a complete refresh.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s look at the people in charge of airline security.  It&#39;s impossible to prevent all weapons from getting though - but let&#39;s look at their sorry record - 0 in 19!</p>

<p>But they must have done a good job on keeping records... getting photos of the hijackers... right?  Sorry, a complete failure.  There&#39;s exactly one video of any of the hijackers, and he isn&#39;t even getting on a doomed plane, but a plane that will connect to it.  </p>

<p>In all the other cases, either the video system was turned off, broken, too badly out of focus to be any use at all (almost half of them alone!) or there was simply no surveillance in that area at all.</p>

<p>Completely failure.  All upper management should have been sacked.  The last thing that should have been done is to take the obviously completely bogus system and blow it up into the huge Homeland Security Department.</p>

<p>I could keep going.</p>

<p>The US Defense Department is the most expensive project in the history of the planet, and all paid for by the US taxpayers.  Doesn&#39;t it bother you that the one time they were tested they failed completely and utterly, in multiple ways?  How can you loo at 9/11 and say, &quot;Everyone did their jobs properly, promotions for all,&quot; (and that&#39;s what happened - almost everyone involved was promoted within a year or two...)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Logical fallacy called &#39;shifting the burden of proof&#39;.</p>

<p>If someone believes the Boston marathon bombings are the result of a &quot;plan to impose martial law&quot; then its up to them to prove it, not someone else to <em>disprove</em> it.</p>

<p>Example (albeit extreme):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Person A: &quot;I have an invisible dragon in my basement&quot;</p>

<p>Person B: &quot;I&#39;m doubtful, can you prove it?&quot;</p>

<p>Person A: &quot;It&#39;s up to you to disprove it&quot;.</p>

<p>Person B: &quot;How am I supposed to do that?&quot;</p>

<p>Person A: &quot;If you can&#39;t disprove it then you have to accept I really do have an invisible dragon in my basement&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No sane individual would accept that Person A has an invisible dragon in there basement merely because no-one has yet to disprove the claim.</p>

Why? i know you believe in Satan or worship some negative being that needs to bring the world to lower vibrations in order for manipulation to take place...but there are some out there who see the truth. and we don&#39;t want to get hurt. we don&#39;t want you to take our freedom..no need to make a new interpretation of the constitution....i know something is going on, ...we all do. we just need to know why? is there really a planet heading over here that will create mass hysteria and you just need to have a little bit of control so that people don&#39;t try to fuck the government up for holding out on all the survival places, gear, and food. OR is this just truly a way for you to create your new world order. You&#39;re obviously trying to reduce world population...

<p>Here&#39;s what they are censoring;</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>BOSTON BOMBING IS A FRAME JOB</strong>, They are screwing the government by coercing the over reaction we saw, using on the take cops and moles in positions of authority, the whole thing looks exactly like a gang-stalking frame job, right down to the &quot;The FBI is Watching Us&quot; and &quot;Taxi Cab Confession.&quot;**  Four months ago, in telling my story, those were the names of two of the posts.  <em>Verbatim.</em></p>

<hr/>

<p>A taxi driver comes forward with a story that a full week ago, he received a full confession in his cab the day of the bombing.  He&#39;s taken seriously by who?  Cab drivers are notorious employees of organized crime and the CIA. I&#39;m a victim of gang stalking, and I&#39;ve <strong>personally</strong> be threatened by so many cab drivers I can&#39;t count them on my fingers.  Afterwords, get this, I was framed for a crime, <strong>wake up</strong>.  This <em>stinks</em> of a frame job.</p>

<p>My story is below, but you don&#39;t have to believe me.  In the links below its <strong>clear</strong> that TAXI drivers have been working for organized crime for decades.   Gang stalking victims have been complaining about it, and I wrote about it <strong>months ago</strong>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I&#39;ve personally witnessed a <strong><a href="http://illuminatiandvatican.com/2013/02/the-hidden-empire.html">vast conspiracy</a></strong> which specifically included the use of a significant number of taxi drivers, and <strong><a href="http://illuminatiandvatican.com/2013/04/false-flags-police-foreknowledge-and.html">corrupt FBI agents</a></strong> who were co-conspirators in an attempt to silence and discredit me.  These taxi drivers appeared to be communicating to a centralized authority via some covert means, most likely mind control.  I specifically wrote about taxi drivers being involved in a <a href="http://illuminatiandvatican.com/2013/01/taxi-cab-confession.html"><strong>conspiracy months ago</strong></a>.  Ironically, this post is called <strong><em>Taxi Cab Confession</em></strong>.</p>

<p>There&#39;s been <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/taxi-drivers-killed-mexico-were-drug-cartels-involved-436066"><strong>recent news linking Taxi drivers to drug cartels</strong></a>  and <a href="http://usopenborders.com/2012/05/presented-to-12-taxi-drivers-in-nl-accuse-them-of-working-for-los-zetas/">12 Taxi Drivers accused of <strong>working for Los Zetas</strong> last May.</a></p>

<p>This conspiracy is real, and from what I have gathered a significant number of taxi drivers in major metropolitan areas are working with this syndicate.  This has been known since the 80&#39;s, when publicly available information disclosed that the Columbian drug cartels used a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cali_drug_cartel#Counterintelligence"><strong>network of Taxi drivers for surveillance</strong></a>.  These cartels, along with the Italian Mafia, are the main <strong>enforcement arm</strong> of what popular culture calls <strong>the Illuminati</strong>, they have globalized just like the rest of the world, and now work in concert with a faction of the US government. </p>

<p>It is very likely that these attacks have been caused by <strong>the Illuminati</strong>, framing the two brothers.  This is their modus operandi, <a href="http://illuminatiandvatican.com/2013/02/the-fbi-is-watching-us.html"><strong>watching people for significantly long periods of time</strong></a> (<strong>Ironic title, The FBI is watching us.</strong>) with faux surveillance, and then framing them.  In addition, I have <a href="http://illuminatiandvatican.com/2013/01/up-yellow-brick-road-to-national.html"><strong>witnessed Federal agents working with this conspiracy</strong></a>, and it&#39;s very possible that the FBI surveillance was intentionally done as a cover operation, by corrupt agents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>wow, so let me ask you something if it&#39;s not true why are you taking the time to create accounts on reddit and sending thousands of people messages with this bull shit. look who ever you are, we don&#39;t want to fight you. We just don&#39;t need to be lied to. You create events to control us...you know who else disarmed civilians before shit went down? Hitler, Mao, Stalin....you see where i&#39;m going here. You insult our intelligence and not only that destroy people for personal government gain. Why? i know you believe in Satan or worship some negative being that needs to bring the world to lower vibrations in order for manipulation to take place...but there are some out there who see the truth. and we don&#39;t want to get hurt. we don&#39;t want you to take our freedom..no need to make a new interpretation of the constitution....i know something is going on, ...we all do. we just need to know why? is there really a planet heading over here that will create mass hysteria and you just need to have a little bit of control so that people don&#39;t try to fuck the government up for holding out on all the survival places, gear, and food. OR is this just truly a way for you to create your new world order. You&#39;re obviously trying to reduce world population... Either way it&#39;s not right, it&#39;s not good to do what you&#39;re doing..hurting children and adults...... i&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s good in you to realize that we are people , we are not body&#39;s without intution, thought, and experiences...i&#39;ve loved, i&#39;ve laughed, i&#39;ve cried, i&#39;ve lived..i&#39;ve gained my right to live here on this planet just like every other person has, ... please stop doing what you&#39;re doing. or start telling us why . i don&#39;t know who you are but i&#39;m sending you Love and Light...from a positive realm..from a positive place in the universe and from my heart...and i&#39;m projecting it to you. from the true God who is all and everything.. who sees what is becoming of us . I love you , whoever you are... you are a part of them i know..but you are a soul..a living breathing entity..as am I. so please stop, we don&#39;t deserve this, we deserve the truth. give us time to prepare for whatever if the reason you&#39;re doing this is because of nibiru or planet x..give us the knowledge that i&#39;m sure your group has...so that we can love more , laugh more before we all meet our endings...and if it&#39;s just for the NWO... just don&#39;t do that. again, we&#39;ve gained our rights to live here, freely..we shouldn&#39;t be dismissed and killed off like cattle. it&#39;s just not right. </p>
