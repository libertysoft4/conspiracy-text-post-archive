That means to organizing and assigning would have to be undertaken by Us. Not mods. I feel like with the amount of information out there, we should be able to all pull together to show, how many of these instances are intertwined, the strings are being pulled by only a few hands.

    <div class="md"><p>All that is hard to prove for regular citizens, this is something we have hard evidence on that we saw live, witnessed and for some of us actually lived it. This is something we can use for change, to show to our fellow man and say look, we have seen this for ourselves, not just me or you but everyone who has been tracking the bombings and read the headlines. We all saw the headlines change, the suspects get caught and killed. so we, maybe for the first time ever, have the numbers, evidence, and ability to call the ones responsible out on their lies and demand to be told the truth. 
. Sooo go call your congress people and pull some strings guys, some one here&#39;s related to someone in power who can bring this up and pursue it. Let them know they have backing, that this is what the people want, tell them to announce their intent to the world (via reddit iama might be the least probable to be altered or tampered with in case of attempts to remove or anything) if anything happens to them then we will know it&#39;s not a coincidence. Who can claim to be existent for the better of the people if they silence their appointed voice? (obviously just for this matter we don&#39;t need no Luke skywalker) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yes! One clued in!</p>

<p>Question: How do you subvert media attention worldwide for a week?</p>

<p>Answer: Bomb the fuck out of ... 2 people. Most probably actors at that.</p>

<p>False flag attacks are not just to start wars. They can be very effective at diverting attention. This whole sub has gone to shits for the past week 98% of the posts are Boston-Bombing related. This is way blown out of proportion.  Thanks for noticing huge policies are in the passing while the whole fucking crowd is staring in awe over a flood of <em>faked</em> bombing pictures of a <em>fake</em> terrorist act by a <em>fake</em> democratic government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your link is horrible.  The guy making the claims thinks it is more likely that all the people effected by the blast were actors rather than the most likely scenario which is that they weren&#39;t actors and some people for one reason or another set off a bomb and hurt people and killed others.  Like our government would never kill innocent people for an agenda.  &quot;We don&#39;t want to hurt or kill a handful of innocent people so we better get some of the best actors ever!&quot;</p>

<p>The one picture the writer says the guy without legs &quot;isn&#39;t even in pain or shock&quot;. How the fuck could he know that?  Yeah, clearly he isn&#39;t in shock by that one picture. Fucking stupid.</p>
