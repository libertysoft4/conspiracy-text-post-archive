    <div class="md"><p>So... I usually don&#39;t believe the stuff I read on this reddit..  I have mocked quite a few as a lurker over the years. I&#39;m not smart to this stuff, I can&#39;t have discussions about a lot of the topics because I am unaware honestly.  There&#39;s two sides to me, always.  I hear them both and gather my own opinion.   I just don&#39;t see how this was a good thing?  Or positive, however you wanna put it, this guy was a suspect and now he is being deported?  I hope the report is false because it stinks a bit.  </p>

<p>For the record I don&#39;t think the government is against me, but I think in terms of being truthful I second guess sometimes.  It&#39;s like the parent that doesn&#39;t want to let their kid see them when they mess up of make an ass of themselves.  I think they may of bad intelligence about this and unfortunately didnt save the day.  Or maybe there&#39;s more or nothing at all. </p>

<p>All I know is this is a crazy story...  I entertain myself with this reddit but I feel like I&#39;m using it as a news source because a lot of good info came from here about all this and wasn&#39;t seen in other reddits. </p>

<p>Lets just hope nothing foul is involved and maybe looking into this too much?  Justice just needs to be served, that poor 8 year old kid man.   He deserves that </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess the short of it is I don&#39;t believe the student is being deported, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the right term.  Deportation requires a judicial proceeding in the United States, there is no way they went through those motions already, the procedural issues alone would prevent it.  Either this guy&#39;s confidential sources are wrong, he&#39;s just reiterating it wrong, or the student had already had deportation proceedings against them that they were avoiding.  </p>

<p>If he was being sent home to Saudi Arabia, it may have been because of close proximity to this attack. Think of how new york neighborhoods reacted when the press started saying it was muslims who committed 9/11. It doesn&#39;t take much for a lynch mob to get rolling.
