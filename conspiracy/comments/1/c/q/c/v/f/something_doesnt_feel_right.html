    <div class="md"><p>which is funny because <a href="http://d3j5vwomefv46c.cloudfront.net/photos/large/760202348.jpg">those special ops guys</a> AKA Craft International are signifiganly more suspicious than these two children. we have photos of them wearing earpieces, carrying radiation detection equipment, and they just appear to be watching as the bomb blows up. They aren&#39;t helping people, clearing debris, just standing around like goons. </p>

<p>We have also seen zero evidence that these kids did anything. No videos that they murdered an MIT officer, no videos or proof that they shot guns and threw bombs at police during a chase. Zero fucking evidence yet people are saying &quot;where is the evidence that they are innocent???&quot;</p>

<p>I thought it was innocent until proven guilty. Guess things work a bit different here in Nazi Gestapo America 2013.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trying to say that it&#39;s not Craft International but... how many different organizations have 9.11 tactical clothing as their uniforms and wear black baseball caps with logos (logos aren&#39;t particularly clear in the photos.) Not trying to disprove just encourage the thought that maybe these guys aren&#39;t who others think they are.  In regards to them not helping out there are a million reasons why that may be.  First and foremost that comes to mind is they were unsure if this was an IED explosion or something further in those first initial moments.  If they&#39;re there for say a WMD threat then they&#39;re going to need to stay available to counter a possible WMD attack that may lie in wait from a secondary device.  Once again I&#39;m not saying that you&#39;re wrong just trying to point out that maybe there&#39;s a logical explanation, if this forum is all about critical and free thinking we should accept critical and free thinking that is contrary to our own from either view point.</p>

<p>They showed a cropped pic of the two guys, pointing out the bags they had in comparison to those found at the scene.</p>

<p>It was <em>clearly</em> inferred that this was a pre-blast pic.  The full picture was post-blast, and they had the bags.</p>

<p>If they were planning a real operation, they&#39;d have all their clothing planned out in advance - they wouldn&#39;t have a chance to make that mistake! - and they&#39;d pick the cap that made them least interesting - probably a Red Sox cap...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, fair call but, why were they the only ones with backpacks? huge ones it that, also they look nothing like <a href="http://www.dvidshub.net/image/391303/6th-civil-support-team-">this</a> Quote from page you linked us to &quot;Here with a backpack that looks identical to those of the uniformed men in Boston:&quot; </p>

<p>Again how did they know to move away form ground zero shortly before the the device was detonated? </p>

<p>Lastly why were they walking away from the blast zone when all the rest of the CST that were showing up to help, were moving toward the blast zone. lots of questions and no answers? <a href="http://i.imgur.com/FE0PlEC.jpg">link to pic</a></p>

<p>Edit: provided a link to to the picture regarding them walking away. </p>

<li><p>They were not the only people with bags, lots of people with them. Every suspect 4chan identified( the guy in blue jacket and white hat, the 40 year old dude I&#39;m a red shirt, craft guys) had one that looked similar. </p></li>
<li><p>There is no proof that they knew to move, maybe they were just lucky. They were pretty close to the explosion when it happened if I remember right, alot closer then I would personally want to be if I knew a bomb was about to go off. </p></li>
<li><p>That picture does not prove they were walking away. They look stationary and grouped around that Chevy.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, but i would like to point out that you also are just speculating about the purposed craft operatives being the CST.</p>

<p>Why is it totally not possible that the craft operatives were in CST uniforms knowing they were going to be there that day as to not look out of place? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you are wrong I&#39;m just throwing questions at reddit about photos that were taken on the day that to me look a little suspicious and need solid answers, where as some people will have nothing to do with any of it unless it points toward the two suspects the FBI gave us.</p>

<p>Edit: A question mark. Also redditors please read on through this thread for clarity.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry blip blip but im pretty confused by your response. I think your missing question marks or have added words. IDK, if your agreeing with me or not really. </p>

<p>It is totally possible that those guys, who we have been refering to as the craft guys(with no proof they are actually craft as many companies use th elogo), dressed the way they did to blend in. Doing that proves nothing though. There are a multitude of reasons to blend in at an event. Both to not draw attention from the people they are trying to watch for or as to be able to set bombs off without being noticed could be valid reasons. Being dressed that way does not prove either though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, i was suffering comprehension issues at the time. I reread your post and in my original reading of your post i was under the impression that you were hard line against any possibility of conspiracy, my bad. Also I did forget to add some question marks.</p>

<p>In saying that when somebody states that there is no proof to a question in a place that is designed for conspiracies and answers alone, it sort of a moot statement because we know there is no proof, that is why we ask the hard questions in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is very much a possibility my friend. With the authorities/FBI in complete denial on the subject and absolutely no evidence other that the two brothers just walking along in photos just like everybody else, it does beg to question. Then they spend tens of millions on trying to find people that they already had in custody(<a href="http://farganne.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/tsarnaevs-arrest-location-faked/">as far as i can tell</a>) (also there was a video of the what looked like the older brother in custody, which i can no longer find) with a fake ass story of how they were on the run the way they locked down entire suburbs whilst invading into peoples homes at gun point. It all smacks of a coverup. </p>

<p>I for one need hard evidence before i can give myself a green light, and atm i haven&#39;t seen or heard one iota of real evidence against the brothers, i have only seen evidence to indicate that this is some sort of cover up/false flag operation.</p>

<p>there is a lot of information to go through and the deeper you look the more damning it looks for the American government.</p>
