        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For what it&#39;s worth, here is my theory so far. Although in many cases I don&#39;t have direct evidence or sources to confirm what I propose, I am relying on past, factual operations and what the media has reported.</p>

<p>The FBI was running a bomb drill at the marathon. Drills as we know, are like war games, thus there had to be fake &quot;perpetrators&quot; in the crowd to try and fool the extra security and bomb sniffing dogs that were focused near the start and finish lines. These two brothers were part of this drill. Whether they had the backpacks that actually had the explosives in it is irrelevant. It&#39;s kinda like a firing squad where 7 guys shoot the condemned but only one has a real bullet. Why were they involved in the drill? My guess is that the older brother was working with the FBI, as said by the mother, probably with a promise to have the process of him becoming nationalized citizen streamlined. Anyhow, so the bombs go off and the brothers meet with their handler who then tells them to stay put, everything is fine. That&#39;s why they appeared to have no escape plan. A medical student and a guy who wanted to be an engineer, had no plans of escape? I guess they were hoping that there&#39;d be no photo or video evidence? The 19 yr old goes to the gym on Wednesday. On thursday night their pictures are now on the news as THE suspects. So then, these terrorists who four days ago set off bombs intending to kill as many Americans as possible carjack some guy, drive around with him for 30 minutes, then let him go unharmed. So after their pictures were out, my guess is they spent the hours proceeding their now obligatory escape getting weapons prepared because they knew it wasn&#39;t gonna be a simple arrest, trial, etc. They&#39;d have to be killed. They get in to the high speed chase and shoot-out with one of the brothers being mortally wounded. The other brother, however, escapes. Escapes a number of police with no helicopter back-up. &quot;Martial law&quot; or whatever term they deemed it ensues in Boston. The whole city shut down while cops search homes with riot gear and assault rifles. They locate suspect #2 in a boat in a backyard, then exchange gun fire with him, allegedly, shooting multiple rounds with automatic weapons into a stationary boat, but don&#39;t kill him. CNN gets a birds eye view of the scene on the roof of a car dealership 500 yards away, but just before the apprehension, were removed by the police. CNN constantly cycles on the ticker the quote from the uncle saying these kids were an embarrassment but don&#39;t mention the quotes from the mom, dad, and aunt who say they were framed.</p>

<p>If it were my guess, I&#39;d say the kid doesn&#39;t live through the night. That way the story being told now, ie radicalized youth, etc, becomes the official one.</p>

<p>Like I said, I can&#39;t verify everything, but most of it was just a recount of the official story so far, that just really doesn&#39;t add up to me. If you can add to this or even discount anything I&#39;ve said, please do. I&#39;d rather have things straight, than continue to believe something that isn&#39;t true. My theories on the FBI handler involvement, by the way, is based on the recent NYTimes article regarding FBI involvement in terror plots, the 1993 WTC bombing, the MLK assassination, etc, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d only disagree with one part.  They may have wanted to kill him, but couldn&#39;t.  I think he will be fine in custody, because they have already said he will not be getting his Miranda Right (no lawyer), and will most likely be shipped off for a &quot;Military Interrogation&quot; (code for torture until he confesses, then he can have a lawyer they suggest).  His mind will be mush by then, so he&#39;ll gladly confess to blowing up the moon just to make the pain stop.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to mention that the FBI has already said that they sat down with suspect 1 two years ago for a conversation.  According to the Mother it was more than one conversation that took place over years (as well as years of surveillance).</p>

<p>We are still waiting to hear about who exactly those Khaki pants and shoe wearing dudes are, and what was their role in all this.  Like you I suspect they were part of a drill, although they probably didn&#39;t know that an actual explosion was going to take place.</p>

<p>I knew something was up when it took the FBI 3 days to point out 2 suspect, and asked everyone to STOP LOOKING for anyone else.  Now that they have admitted that they already knew about these guys, it&#39;s quite possible they are patsy, although they may have been a second choice.  Something tells me things didn&#39;t go according to plan, so they had to make some adjustments to the game plan.  This would explain the false arrest reports on CNN, and the FBI repeatedly cancelling their press conference.</p>

<p>Now, before anyone jumps all over me....</p>

<p>This is just my personal suspicions, I have nothing to back it up, and I&#39;m just riffing here.  I could be completely wrong on all accounts and in no way am I trying to state that anything I&#39;ve said is FACTUAL!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a very imaginative story. It is extremely interesting...the truth? I don&#39;t know, but the interesting none-the-less. </p>

<p>How bout this addition: Wednesday the handler tells the boys to lay low at a pre-defined address. That night, agents randomly &quot;walking dogs&quot; or otherwise pretending to be normal citizens are planting bombs around the  complex. Hidden in planters, inside metal city garbage cans, etc.  Thursday morning they awake to their handler who has provided them with an arsenal of weapons. Tells them to hold tight. Guys can&#39;t leave because they are scared and don&#39;t know what is happening.</p>

<p>Thursday night, agents kill cop, then anonamously call in the troops. When they arrive, bombs go off and shit gets real. The agents think the dudes are going to be killed in a firefight....BUT the 19 year old kids gets away. </p>

<p>Now Boston city cops are involved and they aren&#39;t in on it. They pursue these guys with class and honor. The agents (secret sub-group) are freaking out, they lost control. They want this guy dead, closes the story. But, media, Twitter, cameras, scanners, etc. are now being monitored too tightly. They capture the guy, ALIVE!</p>

<p>My best guess is that some secret security force will &quot;secure the area&quot;, remove all city cops, officials, etc. in the interest of &quot;National Security&quot;.</p>

<p>Tomorrow it will be reported that this terrorist died of his wounds sustained in the firefight with Boston&#39;s finest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty good. Though I think these guys + all the other patsies and agents were held under very tight security the whole time. While the &quot;directors and writers&quot; scripted. Notice how long it took, while they were monitoring all the internet investigations going on? As Alex Jones emphasized, they were about to name 2 suspects they had -in custody-. Then they backtracked, and cleared out the courthouse in a bombscare.... then identified 2... new patsies?  They definitely had a bunch of contingency plans. This wasnt &quot;plan B&quot; or C even Im sure.</p>

<p>As for the car jacking/chase and <strong>assassination</strong> of the MIT officer (as the Boston chief stated it very clearly twice in an interview earlier): the 2 bros were probably kidnapped. as you said, med student and engineer .... they would know better than to try and shoot their way out. then military/black ops went to assassinate the MIT officer on an alleged robbery call. Who made that call? Black ops </p>

<p>One suspect (brother? or maybe another agent) was allegedly killed in the chase. The brother may have been disposed of entirely separately--doesnt matter. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still not sure what the plan was originally to let the 2nd brother &quot;escape&quot; the police chase. Totally BS by the way. How many car chases have you seen end in a shootout, <em>and</em> the guy escapes? Oh and he was in an area with MULTIPLE local/state/fed/military agencies present ... i dont buy that.  Other SKETCHY questions about the chase:
- one guy was carjacked and &quot;released&quot; by authorities. that is a key witness....what ever happened to him?
- the police retracted their statement about robbing a 7/11 (???)</p>

<p>After all that he manages to escape the police perimeter and hide his dying body in a boat, covered by tarp/plastic, and they haul him out under the guise of nightfall, potentially having him bleed to death.  Whether its a patsy for the patsy (ie. fake brother #2), or the brother himself.....we may never know for sure. Keep up the good work!</p>

<p>well at some point they gotta give him up (if he&#39;s even alive any more)... So where is suspect 2? </p>

<p>A. there is, in my skeptic mind, the possibility that Sunil Tripathi was an agent/actor (he is similar enough to their backup patsies, the brothers, to &#39;work with&#39; for hollywood pros). In this case, </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having been in federal law enforcement, the comment I have is about your first assumption - that the brothers were used as the perpetrators in the exercise.  In all the exercises and training I was involved in, it was always someone else in law enforcement, either from another unit in our own agency, or someone from another local law enforcement agency, that played the &quot;bad guy(s).&quot;  We never had anyone not associated with law enforcement play a role like that.  </p>

<p>(For background, I was a special agent with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations for approximately 3 years, along with being an active duty officer in the Air Force.  I just separated with a little over 6 years total service back in September due to my wife and I having a baby.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you guys for the support and feedback. And I totally agree with you Geddy007, on two things. If he waves, or they don&#39;t grant him his Miranda Rights, whether he lives or dies doesn&#39;t really matter. I was really hoping he would be caught alive just to here his side. As much as I love speculating about this stuff, I&#39;d much rather hear some truth. If that&#39;s even possible. </p>

<p>And yes! The khaki wearing guys! No mention of them from any media that I&#39;ve seen at least. They had to have been part of the drill. That&#39;d explain the pictures with and without backpacks, and them all congregated near the blast. Were they confused? Because it doesn&#39;t seem like a good place to rendezvous after a terrorist plot. </p>

<p>The younger brother had also tweeted about smoking pot and rap lyrics. Which wouldn&#39;t fit the &quot;radical&quot; bill. So he had to have been tagging along with older brother on a drill. I can&#39;t imagine tagging along on a bombing.</p>

In fact its scary how id say 97% of the public completely think they are being told the truth, and how excited they got when he was apprehended even having a parade for the martial law that was imposed.

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, look, I don&#39;t put anything past the government. I see all kinds of reason to at least consider the 911 conspiracy theories, because it greatly increased W&#39;s power and ability to help his oil buddies in the Middle East.  But what&#39;s the motivation for FBI to set off two bombs during the Boston Marathon?  Hasn&#39;t really resulted in the ind of &quot;keep &#39;em scared&quot; outcome that 911 did. especially with the quick capture and survival of Dzhokhar.</p>

<p>What I would like an explanation of, however, and have seen absolutely nothing about, is the unloading of automatic weapons fire into the boat.  Did Dzhokhar have a weapon?  Did whoever started the shooting really have any reason to think self defense required those rounds?  Even cops can&#39;t just shoot suspects without a justification based on self-defense.  If Dzhokhar was just hiding under the tarp in the boat, they can&#39;t just riddle the thing with bullets.  If he pops up and points something that looks like a gun at them, that&#39;s one thing, but I haven&#39;t heard anything about something like that happening.  Also, how could they fire that many shots and he still comes out with wounds only in his neck, hands, feet and legs?  How come no news on when the various injuries occurred.  It shouldn&#39;t be that hard to figure out which ones were from the night before.</p>

<p>How &#39;bout some news here?</p>

Since you &quot;know exactly&quot; who I am you should know that I am just a normal citizen such as yourself.

<p>I KNOW one thing, you have a small penis, your fat, you live in your parents basement, chronic masturbatory habits and want so bad to be a cop but you can&#39;t since you are not able to do more than 3 push ups at once. Your greatest achievement was winning second at pokemon and &quot;claiming&quot; an upskirt photo which was really just something you downloaded on the internet.</p>

<p>That above is a total lie, and should be taken as such, but it is an opinion based on one thing, your attitude and as such may in fact be true. At least I made the effort to try and piece things together which in not what you did, you just wrote a couple one liners and claimed victory of nothing. </p>

<p>Ciao!</p>
