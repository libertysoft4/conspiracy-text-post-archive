    <div class="md"><p><strong>TL;DR Go Read my follow up post bellow</strong></p>

<p>As well they should be talking about &quot;us&quot;. The original picture from flicker had the EXIF still intact. Me and few others on 4chan posted here and on RBI, disproving both the original suspects. They are also no where to be found after the blast, leading me to believe they moved on long before...with their bags. We all banged our pots and pans, but once someone has a suspect, they will follow that to any ends, no matter how strong the confirmation bias. The most important part of an analyst&#39;s job isn&#39;t figuring out a solution, <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis/art11.html">it&#39;s figuring out how they came to that solution.</a> I made this alt account specifically so I tell people to stop wasting time drawing silly diagrams, like where a pot and pan might fit in a bag. The guy with the punisher hat and his buddy were x5 as likely as blue jacket guy and his buddy and creepy unibomber looking fellow, based simply on the fact that both of those pictures were objectively and proven taken at least 45 minutes and 1.5 hours before. </p>

<p>It&#39;s astounding how far <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> <a href="/r/findbomber">/r/findbomber</a> or whatever and 4chan took it based on 3 provable false pictures from flicker. By the time i first got my hands on them, they had been meta washed a few times. I had to go back and track down the originals. I felt like I was probably wasting my time, but sure enough, I was correct. Couldn&#39;t have been them. </p>

<p>Tl;dr </p>

<p>Myself, and a few other fringe lunatics, that actually know what we&#39;re talking about were shunned yesterday, when we provided meta data, EXIF data, and a few other bits of forensic work that disproved all three of the &#39;4chan suspect&#39; groups. I was called a CoIntelPro agent and promptly down-voted. </p>

<p>They&#39;re easily interpreted as security personnel with detectors, so questioning things at this level seems counter-productive. It&#39;s interesting to note (not interpret in the open with no information to back it up) their presence and their attitude towards the suspect though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edit: ITT: The U.S Government, FBI CoIntelPro, the Illuminati and probably Mossad and Seal Team 6, NSA, and Chomby The Genie downvote me for speaking the truth. Get the fuck at me.</p>

<p>Most of the people propagating those sentiments and so called &quot;factual&quot; assertions and &quot;questions&quot; (I.E their subjective, biased opinion) are the <strong>conspiracy nuts.</strong> When I say nuts, I mean mentally disturbed. Like honestly diagnosably mentally ill. I mean the types that simply want to believe in a true conspiracy, like the X-files. I WANT TO BELIEVE.</p>

<p>My theory on them? It&#39;s to satisfy their own ego. I think it&#39;s a schizoid personality arch-type to be honest. Some might have a bit of a deep seeded ego-problem, perhaps both inferiority and narcissistic subtypes (that is to say some of them are trying to prove their own self-worth by &quot;raging against the machine&quot;, because they have failed in most other aspects in life, due largely in part to learning disabilities and mental illness... and others truly view themselves as superior to others, thus when added in conjunction and put in context with true mental illness, you get the holistic (or close to) conspiracy THEORY archtype -- This theory took me about 2 minutes to think up out no where, I&#39;m not a doctor, I have no idea what I&#39;m talking about... so it probably doesn&#39;t hold much rational clinical weight, but it seems legit enough to post drunkely). </p>

<p>Tl;dr </p>

<p><strong>I think most of the people asserting this bullshit are looking for a reason to prove &quot;the government&quot; evil to satisfy their own pathological, ego-centric existence as valid, and their schizotypical mental ailments invalid.</strong> I don&#39;t mean this offensively, but schizophrenia (especially in the prodromal phases before it&#39;s full blown delusional) often draws these individuals with a predisposition in.  </p>

<p>These guys (who will hopefully label me as CoIntelPro) go around the internet &quot;JAQing&quot; off (just asking questions) and will quite literally talk themselves into circular logic. Again with the ego, anyone who says otherwise, even in the face of object logic and concrete evidence is ultimately written off as &quot;insane&quot; or worse yet &quot;part of the conspiracy&quot;. It&#39;s a fixation for some, a hobby for others, and a meer interest for others. Some just lack the investigative tools, or object reasoning skills, or even basic human (un)common sense to think even the slightest bit rationally. They&#39;ll sit around counting every character here, hoping to crack my secret code for hours. They&#39;ll read the first word of every sentence I&#39;ve written, desperately trying to figure out what this means WW91IGd1eXMgYXJlIGlkaW90cy4g and whether it&#39;s an access code my old Northrup credentials from Skunkworks and if I&#39;m secretly defecting from the illumanti and the whole rest of this message was just to hide this simple sentence that they should follow!!!!) </p>

<p>In this fashion, the band-waggon effect can turn an extremely fringe minority into a full blown which hunt circleJAQoff session. <strong>It&#39;s so much easier to claim intelligence under the guise of &quot;I question the answer, there for I am superior by nature&quot;</strong> than it is to truely study FACTS, come to any rational analytic conclusion, or reasonably solidfied ideological platform to stand on (in this case the government ran a false -flag operation). It&#39;s an ideology more than it is a subjective notion. What I mean is it&#39;s a way of thinking more than it is the thought or event in question (last week Sandyhooky, this week the bombing and so on) The idea of being part of a conspiracy (or uncovering it) is much more seductive than reading a book, and accepting the fact that you actually haven&#39;t the slightest fucking clue what you&#39;re doing with your life and you&#39;re living in denial of your mental illness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hehehe. Man you&#39;re on an epic rant, but I have to take issue with some of the things you said. I have to concur that the conspiracy theory circle is a breeding ground for aggravating mental illnesses, but being paranoid doesn&#39;t mean nobody&#39;s after you. And it&#39;s possible for some people to know something that most people have no clue about, and that this something has a hard time fitting in the &quot;common&quot; worldview. (Which is convenient for anyone wanting to pull one out on people.... I&#39;ll show myself out).</p>

<p>Absolutely true. I&#39;ve been ranting all day, I thought I was on AngryRantingRealist. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And it&#39;s possible for some people to know something that most people have no clue about, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;re both breathing proof of this; however, I don&#39;t blindly adhere to a theory because it peeks my interests. Investigative journalist in high school, CIS major college, DHS internship late college, and my employment &quot;goes dark&quot; after that (it sounds so much cooler than signing NDAs and working as ....well...I do work.). The cognitive dissonance I live with every day of my life is absurd. </p>

<p>Most people should &quot;wake-up&quot; and smell the coffee and question the answer...but the motive behind that statement shouldn&#39;t just because it&#39;s trendy. To me, it feels like most people here are throwing ice-cubes at the sun. </p>

<p>Most backpacks have those extra straps, normally if it&#39;s a black backpack then the additional strap will be grey/white.</p>

<p>That picture proves nothing.</p>

<li><p>No, most backpacks do not have two-tone straps.  Although I&#39;m sure many do.</p></li>
<li><p>By your logic almost no picture will ever be useful.  Over the last few days many people have been investigating photos with the limited evidence available, namely the shredded backpack in question. </p></li>
<li><p>This picture only offers this guy up as a suspect - no picture we&#39;ve seen proves anything.    I think it&#39;s important to identify as many suspects as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>I think it&#39;s suspicious that this photo would be downvoted <em>without comments</em>.  I posted this <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cmdjm/another_boston_suspect_this_guy_has_the_grey/">here</a> and it died with 7 down votes and no comments.  Thats is a-typical of reddit behavior.  Redditors love to comment especially when they down vote you.</p></li>

If there is an earpiece in that ear, its very very small. It looked like he was itching his ear to me and i would guess they blurred him because of his close proximity to the cameras.</p>

<p>so it doesn&#39;t mess with the jury to accuse them in front of 315 million people - but it DOES mess with the jury to show evidence that they did it.   </p>

<p>is that kind of like how they threw out the photos and videos of when they killed Bin Laden and dumped his body into the ocean?  or is it like the &quot;Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot; in Iraq?  funny, the government never seems to be able to  show the public any <strong>key evidence</strong> whatsoever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.. I&#39;m sure they could attempt to contact the &quot;agency&quot; you work for...but most people aren&#39;t interested in attending press conferences and I will tell you that they don&#39;t do much for a lot of events. Generally all press is corralled into a small space and only allowed to be there for part of the event. So if anyone is thinking about trying it it really isn&#39;t worth the hassle. I carry my old pass with me in my purse for funnsies. You can probably even Google to see what press passes look like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hehehe. Man you&#39;re on an epic rant, but I have to take issue with some of the things you said. I have to concur that the conspiracy theory circle is a breeding ground for aggravating mental illnesses, but being paranoid doesn&#39;t mean nobody&#39;s after you. And it&#39;s possible for some people to know something that most people have no clue about, and that this something has a hard time fitting in the &quot;common&quot; worldview. (Which is convenient for anyone wanting to pull one out on people.... I&#39;ll show myself out).</p>

<p>Absolutely true. I&#39;ve been ranting all day, I thought I was on AngryRantingRealist. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And it&#39;s possible for some people to know something that most people have no clue about, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;re both breathing proof of this; however, I don&#39;t blindly adhere to a theory because it peeks my interests. Investigative journalist in high school, CIS major college, DHS internship late college, and my employment &quot;goes dark&quot; after that (it sounds so much cooler than signing NDAs and working as ....well...I do work.). The cognitive dissonance I live with every day of my life is absurd. </p>

<p>Most people should &quot;wake-up&quot; and smell the coffee and question the answer...but the motive behind that statement shouldn&#39;t just because it&#39;s trendy. To me, it feels like most people here are throwing ice-cubes at the sun. </p>
