    <div class="md"><p>Same. I spent all day monitoring mainstream media, then swang past here to see some alternative theories. No proof of anything, just interesting questions and connections. It&#39;s healthy to try and get both sides to something. You know... instead of just mindlessly absorbing corporate approved news media, it&#39;s kind of socially healthy to discuss these things amonst each other. It&#39;s what humans do. Nothing wrong with it at all. Sometimes we don&#39;t use the best phrasing or wording, but it&#39;s the discussion itself that&#39;s important.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  I believe in all kinds of conspiracies - usually once I look at the evidence and decide I don&#39;t find it convincing.  The simple fact is there isn&#39;t much evidence to review at all so far, and all that the existing evidence indicates is that someone set a bomb off.  You can&#39;t have a conspiracy theory without a motive and an official story that doesn&#39;t stand up to scrutiny.  </p>

<p>Larger profile events will of course cause more traffic. You can&#39;t just jump to the conclusion that there are &quot;shills&quot; running around trying to discredit you. They don&#39;t need to when so many people will do it for them from a place of ignorance, but that is not something you can control. </p>

<p>All you can do is be objective and honest with yourself. Deduce and analyze. Remember, a lie is a co-operative act. Educate yourself and ask questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Umm....</p>

<p>When nothing is happening, people who aren&#39;t members of this subreddit are much less likely to visit it.  Thus, the people here (during those times of decreased activity) are going to share the same conspiratorial views/opinions, and are going to be more inclined to reach that &quot;general consensus&quot; that you speak of.</p>

<p>When something <em>does</em> happen, however, people who don&#39;t share r/conspiracy&#39;s views/opinions are going to come here either to ridicule, or just because it&#39;s interesting to read conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> can (logically) jump to the conclusion that the fact that people are flooding <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> after a huge event means that those people are government shills/plants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well all that I can say is that if you have a differing view, you should at least explain your viewpoints and support it with articles and other news sources.

    <div class="md"><p>No because he&#39;s a general troll who tends to provide no credible information for any of his claims and he uses obviously baiting tactics to provoke users into aggression and so forth. I feel he only serves to waste peoples time rather than substantiating a discourse and for those reasons I feel a person should be at least warned at first, but then banned if further action need be taken.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re 21+ and you used forums when you were a kid you&#39;ll remember there was firm moderation and it was clear to see the benefits it has. If a user gets banned they can always make another account and just use that, it&#39;s not that difficult of a problem to work around.</p>

<p>This is why you need to have clear structure and organization of topics and facts on those topics. I am glad this sub is taking that approach and I feel if we all work together we can make it even better, even to the point where we can turn it into a best selling conspiracy theories book. </p>

<p>All you need to do is get a list of key conspiracies with actual data to prove them as true such as 9/11 being an inside job and JFK assassination being an inside job and so on. Expound on the main points with key facts and then cite not only those sources directly but at the end of each topic cite other sources and books and such.</p>

<p>TL;DR - Read my post, why I think people should be banned and then how we should write a conspiracies book.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>this is not a correct understanding of a fallacious appeal to authority. it IS an appeal to authority, it simply isn&#39;t a fallacious appeal. let me explain.</p>

<p>consider this sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I&#39;m a statistically trained researcher who prefers data to wild-assed speculation and thinks that the notion of &#39;no coincidences&#39; is nonsense, especially since they happen all the time with measurable probability.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>to begin with, this sentence is a direct response to your question: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>who are you people to be throwing out probabilities? did i suddenly start talking to master chaos theoreticians?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>the ad hominem fallacy in this remark is apparent, as you admitted (&quot;snide remark&quot;)--one need not be a &quot;master chaos theoretician&quot; to be able to knowledgeably discuss or act on probabilities (see, bookies). </p>

<p>when you directly challenge someone to identify what credentials they possess to speak authoritatively about statistics, and the person replies that he is a trained researcher, this is not a fallacious argument from authority, it is the answer to a question.</p>

<p>ex.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>X: what authority do you have to know whether widgets are capable of scrying?</em></p>

<p><em>Y: i invented the scrying widget.</em></p>

<p><em>X: ah.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>as illustrated in the above example, ATomatoAmI&#39;s claim isn&#39;t a fallacy if he actually IS a trained statistician, according to the wiki article to which you linked.</p>

<p>but secondly, and more importantly, according to that same wikipedia article, a <em>fallacious</em> appeal to authority only occurs when at least one of two conditions is met:</p>

<p>a) the appeal is to an inexpert entity, or the misrepresentation of expert consensus and/or 
b) the appeal is used to claim that a subsequent argument is <em>true</em>.</p>

<p>in the case of a), AtomatoAmI has already illustrated why it is <em>improbable</em> (not impossible) that the man on the roof is the bomber, using the most commonly agreed upon understanding (i.e., consensus) of probability, namely, that there are 3,999,999 chances that the figure in the photo is not the bomber.</p>

<p>however, even beyond this, ATomatoAmI&#39;s response to your question can be rephrased into a valid syllogism, according to your wikipedia article:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>X holds that A is true.</li>
<li>X is a legitimate expert on the subject matter, and/or</li>
<li>The consensus of subject-matter experts agrees with X.</li>
<li>Therefore, there exists a presumption that A is true. </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>here is AtomatoAmI&#39;s response, rephrased in the form of the above syllogism:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>ATomatoAmI holds that it is much more probable that the figure on the roof is a random bystander.</p></li>
<li><p>ATomatoAMI claims to be a legitimate expert on probability statistics (indeterminate), and provides a valid example of probability--1 in 4,000,000--in the case of the boston bombing, and/or</p></li>
<li><p>The consensus among statisticians is that, all things being equal, 1 chance out of <em>any</em> number in the millions is fairly long odds, and AtomatoAmI&#39;s explanation of probability comports with the accepted understanding of probability.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, there exists a presumption that the man in the photo is a bystander, and not the bomber.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>naturally, you can whittle down the 4,000,000 number with qualifiers, but each time you whittle down, you must justify your reasoning:</p>

<p>if you say that only the people who were present at the finish line at the time of the bombing can be suspect, you must explain why. if you say that only the people on rooftops can be suspect, you must explain why.</p>

<p>because ATomatoAmI provided you with a reasonable and elementary explanation of why it is less probable that the figure on the roof is the bomber, as opposed to a random bystander (<em>&quot;the Greater Boston area is home to about 4 million, making any one person have about 1 in 4 million odds of being the bomber if this was a normal day and a one-person bombing&quot;</em>), and because a similar explanation of probability can be found explicitly in or inferred from any basic <a href="http://www.math.hawaii.edu/%7Eramsey/Probability/TwoDice.html">reference</a> on <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Echance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/book.html">probability statistics</a>, it is reasonable to assume that ATomatoAmI is correct, regardless of his claim to be a trained researcher.</p>

<p>also, as AtomatoAmI explained, this probability does not mean it is impossible for the figure on the roof to be the bomber, simply that it is improbable, and his reasoning requires only a basic understanding of probability statistics in order for that probability to be <em>presumed</em> to be true. new information can change the probability, or, if the bomber were positively identified to be the person on the roof, would change the relative improbability into a certainty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Replies like AtomatoAmI&#39;s in that thread have done nothing but try to <strong>completely</strong> throw the linked photograph out as <strong>irrelevant</strong>. My posts in turn were trying to open the subject into an actual discussion, not someone saying that this is improbable so therefore it is irrelevant.

<p>Lets talk probabilities. First, I never claimed that the man in the photograph was the bomber. Second, there is more to the situation then what was being replied to.</p>

<p>no, you&#39;ve simply tried to discredit people who say that it <em>probably</em> isn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My posts in turn were trying to open the subject into an actual discussion, not someone saying that this is improbable so therefore it is irrelevant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>in other words, not an open discussion, if talk of improbabilities is attacked or forbidden.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>as i pointed out in my detailed reply, it wasn&#39;t necessary. his explanation of the probability that the figure in the photo is the bomber comports with the accepted definition of same, as anyone who has taken a junior high school math course can read for themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there is more to the situation then what was being replied to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>you have one person who claims that there were &quot;spotters&quot; bomb sniffing dogs on the roofs. do other people make this claim? is there any reason to assume that this would not be a normal part of security at any internationally televised public event, other than this man&#39;s testimony? </p>

<p>it doesn&#39;t sound to me like this does much to support the notion of the figure in the photograph being the bomber. it does seem to suggest that the police <em>suspected</em> or were <em>prepared for</em> an event like this one, which <em>could</em> mean that they received advanced warning, but that supposition appears to be based entirely upon the subjective inferences of this one individual.</p>

<p>again, the figure in the photo could be the bomber, and CNN could have been lying. the question is whether, at this point, there is enough information to act upon these assumptions. there doesn&#39;t seem to be, and if you&#39;re going to have an &quot;open&quot; discussion, then discussion regarding the likelihood that the coach&#39;s testimony and the photograph are simply coincidental cannot be excluded, particularly when the math plainly points in that direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cannot jump to conclusions. All we can do is point out &quot;intent&quot; and that comes after the fact. Like 9/11 we can go back and see what events came from those events. Like a detective you have to ask yourself what the &quot;motive&quot; was. </p>

<p>So right now this is observation time. You have to observe and not jump to conclusions. Watch the media and see what kind of spin it puts on the situation. For example; If they push for more gun control than all you can say is &quot;The media is using this event to push for more gun control&quot;, this however doesn&#39;t mean they necessarily committed the act, they could just be capitalizing on these events. </p>

<p>In the case of 9/11 the explanations given for the buildings collapsed originated from the 9/11 commission. Now we can ask &quot;Why would they say the building fell due to structural fire&quot; and compare that to knowledge we do have available about architecture. </p>

<p>Observe and deduce.</p>
