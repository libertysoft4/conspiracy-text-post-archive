<p>I&#39;d say: let the people decide. Upvote/downvote takes care of most problems, right? It&#39;s a bit ironic to me that a subreddit that strives to unmask governments and the likes who try to take away personal freedom, actually announces that they&#39;ll ban anyone who &quot;is being a dick&quot;, aka: doesn&#39;t agree with you.

<p>Crazy, n; A mentally deranged person</p>

<p>Deranged: v; To become insane</p>

<p>Insane: adj; In a state of mind that prevents normal perception</p>

<p>How is believing that there might be extraterrestrial life make somebode not sane? How does that make their perception skewed? Because there are a lot of sci-fi shows on this topic, I&#39;m sure there are plenty of average people who believe aliens are real somewhere in the universe. Are they all literally mentally incapable of seeing the world properly? </p>

<p>Forget the reptilians as shapeshifters for a minute and just look at your argument. Why does this make David crazy? He is clearly right about a LOT of other things. Let people believe what they want, if it comes to be false they have to deal with it. Not you.</p>

<p>Quantum physicists have evidence that there are other dimensions... it is mainstream science now... so why would other dimensions not be populated?

    <div class="md"><p>If you look at these top threads you&#39;ll generally see some responses which initially sit at 1-2 votes, then a new response will skyrocket 15-30+ above the others. it generally agreees with the top comment - to make it seem like more people believe with the top comment. since it has so many upvotes, dirveby users just browsing here will read it and shrug everything off. it&#39;s a technique which has been going on since I joined, and it is not easy to track or stop.</p>

<p>keep a list of saved links for evidence towards accounts you think are dropping comments and gaming votes. save the entire comment threads. I will be doing this over the next 2-4 weeks and hopefully mods will just remove the comments after enough repeats when it continues to happen over and over.</p>

<p>you&#39;re telling me you honestly believe that mods will never be tempted to ban someone they disagree with more than someone they agree with? because that alone is enough to assure that people WILL end up being banned for their opinions.</p>

<p>I recall reading a thread in which you banned someone from this subreddit before they&#39;d even posted to it. So you having this &quot;up/downvotes don&#39;t work&quot; philosophy is unsurprising. People with power always think their possession of it is for the common good. And people with power always want more of it.</p>

But this guy claiming to have befriended someone in the 13 families of the Illuminati is a bit of a stretch for me with very little evidence. It appears to me to be conspiratard rope-a-dope.

<p>It is basically the Israeli card, but on another level. </p>

<p>Ie: Whenever something major happens, you have a lot of mouth pieces trying to blame the Israelis or Mossad.</p>

<p>And, in this case, whenever there is genuine subject to discuss, some idiot will come waltzing along and bring up the ridiculous catchall term &quot;Illuminati&quot; and ruin the conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What constitutes a worthy conspiracy? For instance if someone posts about lizard people they get flamed, but in turn if you post about Syria or something , it&#39;s considered a conspiracy? Is this not a sub for ALL conspiracies , not just political ones?</p>

<p>Maybe we need a new sub for activism , or government distrust , so were not all labeled under the &quot;nut job&quot; category by our peers, and we can be taken seriously</p>

<p>Well, well, well. Aren&#39;t you a nazi piece of shit. I&#39;ll save you the trouble you faggot fuck, enjoy your fiefdom of pansies and supplicants. People like you are pathetic, life isn&#39;t nice, it isn&#39;t pleasant. You are seriously one of the worst mods on this entire website, which is saying quite a lot. Die in a fire, cunt.</p>
