    <div class="md"><p>Please enlighten me as to how the bombing was supposed to be stopped. I find it funny how people are saying the US is a police state, no privacy, all that shit. When the only way this could have been prevented is if the US actually WAS a police state with no privacy. Had that been the case, the suspects two backpacks would have been searched, and the bombing prevented.</p>

<p>So please, internet expert on all things terrorism and crime prevention, tell me. How do you stop two people from putting home made bombs in backpacks and blowing them up in a crowd of people? I&#39;ll be here waiting for your answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a load of bull. Here in Britain, we have a history of bomb attacks and it has never been like the over the top display in Boston. I can tell you how else you could have stopped the attack: By educating people to be vigilant about unattended luggage, to call someone when they see a lone bag sitting there. Trust people to look after themselves and not treat them like small kids in need of armed soldiers holding their hands. Go to London; no military like Police display but plenty of awareness by the people. Just try and leave a bag somewhere in London, try and see what will happen! After that I will tell you that this is the way and not tanks and rifles... </p>

<p>To be fair, being blanketed with CCTV cameras minimizes the need for boots on the ground. If it helps you sleep at night to think that it&#39;s vigilance and not big brother watching your back then more power to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His referring most likely to the IRA threat in the past, they didn&#39;t have many CCTV back then. The policy was &quot;see an unattended package, report it to a police officer or X official&quot;. This still didn&#39;t prevent the bombings, but as the previous poster said there has never been such a GI Joe response like I&#39;ve seen over in the USA. </p>

<p>Also, what in the fuck is with police wearing camo? They&#39;re fucking police not soldiers! Also the &quot;I&#39;ve got a big gun&quot; hanging off a jeep/Humvee? Some sort of big play club or some shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In urban areas more so, but there&#39;s no federal national campaign to link them all and cover 100% of streets. Most are local city/towns getting into it for one reason or another. Or just shop owners who are sick of XYZ in front of their shop and cameras help protect their investments, especially for things like crimes in the middle of the night to prove to insurance companies what actually happened. At least that&#39;s why most of the businesses downtown have cameras, and for most they can&#39;t just email a link to the FBI and then they have everything. Most records are kept on tape, not always on tape players FBI agents carry in their trunks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not scoring childish points, I am merely comparing. Of course we are being watched too much here in the UK and I don&#39;t like that one bit. I only said that we never had tanks rolling through the street because of a couple of bombs. I know because we lived right in top of a shopping center when two went off in the 1990s [huge bombs they were, destroyed almost all store fronts and injured many people. We were not allowed downstairs until they had made sure it was safe and then it was back to normal. I even suffered from shell shock later that day. But talking about cameras, they are obsolete in a society that is alert and knows what is going on. I am saying this because mainly cameras will NOT deter any crimes, it will merely record the crime. Living, thinking, alert humans who care is all that is needed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last I was in London, I did see military style police who carried MP5&#39;s. I was also constantly aware that everything I did while I was in the city was recorded by CCTV. There was no recent attack, that&#39;s just what London is like. We have a saying in the states about sacrificing liberty for safety and how well that goes. We sometimes forget the faces of our fathers, but at least we have the saying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re not dressed in military gear, they&#39;re the TSG, territorial support group. They are  in use for government buildings and diplomatic security. You will only see them in London, around Westminster. They drive red vehicles and are based in Charing Cross police station.</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t like them, they&#39;re always walking around with a swagger and think they&#39;re the dog bollocks. I always shake my head at them when they walk past in the street. I personally believe if the police want/need guns, it should not be displayed when walking to or from the location, i personally find it disturbing. They even go into the fucking supermarket with them on. I know that will sound odd to people who are surrounded by armed police as a norm, but to me it&#39;s creepy!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, if I assume someone noticed the bag immediately, was able to find/notify an official immediately, and the official was nearby and started evacuating the area immediately, I still think it is doubtful they would have gotten people away on time.  I think the only way of preventing this one was a 100% bag check for anyone in the area which I think this forum would argue is an invasion of privacy/violation of rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So any time someone sets a bag or backpack on the ground, you&#39;re supposed to alert the authorities? I am supposed to stop watching the Boston Marathon and pay attention to the 10,000 people in the crowd and if any one of them puts their bag down, even for a second, I am supposed to run over to a security guard/police officer and tell them to check it out. And if security was so perfect and awesome in Britain, you wouldn&#39;t have &quot;a history of bomb attacks&quot;, would you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well as has been revealed the FBI already had records on these two guys and previously investigated one of them.

    <div class="md"><p>How could they have stopped it? They were investigating them. That&#39;s it. Is the FBI supposed to follow these guys around, tap their phones, and track everything they buy, in hopes that they see receipts from the hardware store with a suspicious number of pressure cookers on them? Now THAT would be a violation of civil rights and privacy right there. They had done nothing wrong before the bombings, and were treated as such by the FBI and local law enforcement. There is a thread on the top of this subreddit about how despite the entire Watertown area being shut down, it was a citizen who found Suspect #2, not the police. So I guess it&#39;s ok to mock the police and FBI when they can&#39;t find someone hiding in a boat, but it&#39;s perfectly fine to turn around and suggest they could have stopped the bombing by pre-emptively arresting two innocent men who they had only investigated?</p>

<p>I see a lot of ranting about &quot;rights&quot; and &quot;illegal searches&quot;, and very little in the shape of evidence to support this claim. You can&#39;t go from &quot;police enter home&quot; to immediately concluding that it was an <em>illegal search</em> that violated someone&#39;s <em>rights</em>. That just doesn&#39;t follow.

<p>That&#39;s what people who were actually there told others, yes. The police knocked on the door and asked to search the premises. If the owners denied them access, they didn&#39;t do the search.</p>

<p>There really wasn&#39;t any chance that people were actively <em>hiding</em> this guy, so there was no reason to go breaking down doors. It was more a case of &quot;he might be hiding in your house without you knowing, like in a cellar or something, will you let us check?&quot; rather than &quot;we&#39;re going to search your home for the fugitive we think you&#39;re harboring&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, it really isn&#39;t. That&#39;s the confirmation bias conspiracy theory version, not what actually happened. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We have two houses left of the sweep,&quot; rings loud and clear into my ears.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I honestly didn&#39;t listen much to the scanners, but so what? Does what you quoted somehow prove that they didn&#39;t respect people&#39;s rights? It could just as easily mean &quot;two houses we haven&#39;t checked at all&quot;, where &quot;checked&quot; means either searched through or asked but was denied access.</p>

<p>Besides all this, as has been pointed out several times now, the police <em>did</em> have some rights to search homes whether you gave them access or not, and it wouldn&#39;t be neither illegal nor disrespecting anyone&#39;s rights.</p>

<p>Simply put, your home is not a sovereign nation. You do have rights, but not endless, infinite rights. As far as I can tell, no one - <em>no one</em> - has been able to substantiate a single instance of the police explicitly searching a person&#39;s who <em>against their wishes</em> and without good cause. In other words, what would <em>actually</em> be considered an illegal search.</p>

<p>This is what I pointed out too. Someone said to me, &quot;The cops finally found him,&quot; and I said &quot;No. They did not. They missed him completely. The search failed actually.&quot; (The search that violated lots of people&#39;s rights, no less.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, one police officer, who declined to be named, told me: ‘It looks like the guy had suffered wounds the night before. Tonight he fired first and officers on the scene returned fire. <strong>I heard on the radio that he’s been hit in the neck and leg.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe there&#39;s just some confusion (in fact, I would expect there to be for a least a few days after). However, this is the Daily Mail, not the most reputable of sources.</p>

<p>I suppose time will tell. My only point was that a suicide attempt is not at all unlikely and very probable to end up just that way, wounding him in the neck rather than killing him.</p>

<p>Regardless, nowhere near enough evidence to suspect a &quot;conspiracy&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, not enough evidence <strong>yet</strong>. Police don&#39;t like to release their video and audio recordings, particularly if they contradict official statements already made. Unidentified sources (like the ones used in the DailyMail article) are always a problem too. Also, as you say, confused reporting among the media in the early stages is typical. Everyone wants an exclusive, witnesses make misstatements. For example, I don&#39;t find the statement &quot;heard it on the radio&quot; very reassuring. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No citizen with a weapon helped stop anything during the several days from the bombing to the apprehension of the remaining terrorist.</p>

<p>In fact, people, in their zealous mob mentality, rather managed to tackle and accuse one innocent person right after the bombing, and destroy the life of another by spamming photos of him allegedly being the bomber (naturally, the media shares some of the blame there). Those are just the ones we know about.</p>

<p>The citizen who <em>did</em> contribute did so safely and responsibly. He did not try to go in, guns blazing, he simply alerted the police who could then proceed to apprehend him without anyone else getting hurt (he shot himself in the mouth, as far as I know no one else fired at him).</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t know what it is you have to make yourself believe to have it be any other way. The police did what they were supposed to, and so did most everyone else. There was no bullying, there was no police state left after he was found (did the police all go back to their respective stations, leaving the neighborhood just as it was before, or did they not?), no one is taking away anyone&#39;s rights and no one is telling anyone they are incapable of defending themselves.</p>

<p>If anything, the government is <em>offering</em> to defend the people, so that <em>they won&#39;t have to</em>. People voluntarily join the police, national guard or military <em>to defend everyone else</em>. Voluntarily. They offer to stand in the line of fire and risk getting hurt or killed <em>so you won&#39;t have to</em>. What part of that is hard to understand?</p>

<p>I am only refusing to answer questions that have absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the topic of discussion. That includes who I am, where I went to school, and who I work for. It&#39;s not relevant. Asking me those questions and pointing out that I won&#39;t answer them <em>is not</em> itself an answer to the questions I asked you before, several comments up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is there some specific question you want me to answer?</p>

<p>Scroll up. I&#39;m not going to do your work for you. If you&#39;ve avoided the questions for so long you can no longer remember what they are, that&#39;s on you, not me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At this moment, the only one I would like you to answer is whether you argue on the internet for your own pleasure or not.</p>

<p>And I already told you, that has nothing to do with anything. My answer wouldn&#39;t in any way impact the questions I&#39;ve asked so far, nor the arguments I&#39;ve made. Don&#39;t try to deflect by pretending I&#39;m somehow more important or interesting than your answers.</p>

<p>None of those questions have a significant impact on the discourse at hand.

So obviously he was wounded from the first shootout where his brother was killed, because the owner of the boat reported seeing blood on the boat when he called the police. I guess he was scared enough and wounded he used everything he had left to get in that boat.</p>

I remember them saying he went outside after the residents were permitted to go outside, he said the police had been there earlier to search, but after going outside when permitted he noticed things looked different, and he saw blood, so that&#39;s when he called the police back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you know WHY the police didn&#39;t find ? Because HE WAS A BLOCK OUTSIDE THEIR PERIMETER, YOU BOZO. He probably fled that far before the perimeter was firmly established. He likely stayed there the whole time because had he emerged, someone would have seen him and he would have been immediately apprehended. </p>

<p>Hell, it&#39;s ENTIRELY PLAUSIBLE that law enforcement officials had an ULTERIOR MOTIVE when they made the announcement suspending the shelter-at-home order. They likely figured Tsarnaev would try to escape once people were out and about again; he just never had a chance.</p>

<p>Seriously, you people are ridiculous. Not everything is as evil as it looks. I&#39;d bet dollars to donuts if a known suspected terrorist who&#39;d attacked police with homemade explosives and shot an officer sitting in his cruiser was on the loose in your neighborhood, you&#39;d being singing a different tune. You&#39;d be THRILLED law enforcement was out doing their jobs and hunting him down. </p>

<p>And hey, Boston law enforcement actually took someone in alive, which is more than the pinheads in California can say after the manhunt for Christopher Dorner. That resulted in two wounded, innocent Asian women and a crispy corpse when they torched the cabin he was in. By comparison, Boston-area law enforcement seem exceedingly competent. </p>

<p>People are pissed because cops forced their ways into homes to search. Many people say it was necessary to use such a large force in order to be sure they caught him. They advised everyone to stay inside their homes.</p>

<p>AND...they said more than once they were pretty sure he was inside that perimeter. They obviously had a good reason to set the boundaries of the perimeter the way they did. And the fact they were off by a mere block is a pretty good indicator that they had a grasp on what they were doing. </p>
