        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m new to this sub.  Not generally a conspiracy guy.  But when I started reading up on Russian-Chechan terrorism, I saw a lot of shady shit.  (The Apartment bombings in 1999, the theatre crisis, Breslan, etc.)  At the very least, this makes me want full disclosure of what happened in Boston.</p>

<p>Here are some of the things that, in my mind, need answers.  Maybe some of them have been addressed, and you can fill me in.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What the heck happened at the 7-11?  Originally it was reported that the suspects were robbing it.  Now the claim is that they just happened to be there when someone else was robbing it.  This is an incredible coincidence.  Where is the surveillance footage, which a 7-11 surely has?  Wouldn&#39;t this have given the police info on what clothes the suspects were wearing that night?</p></li>
<li><p>Who is this Saudi who was taken in to custody?  What was he arrested for, where is he now, and why is he being forgotten by the media?</p></li>
<li><p>Who was the &quot;naked man&quot; brought into custody and supposedly released?  Why isn&#39;t he talking to the media, when they are interviewing people that just happened to live in the area and know nothing? From the footage I&#39;ve seen, you can&#39;t see his face, but he has a build similar to Tamerlan Tsarnaev.  In fact, the first thing I thought was &quot;damn, this guy is ripped.&quot;  The kind of body a boxer would have.  This doesn&#39;t mean anything on its own, but it raises suspicion until we know who the naked man was.</p></li>
<li><p>Why were the names of the suspects not released at the same time as the photos?  If the Boston FBI interviewed Tamerlan, someone (or computer software) should have recognized him almost immediately.</p></li>
<li><p>Where is video of any of the shootout or car chase that happened?  One of those police cars must have had a dash cam.  Why selectively withhold this video, when they released other pictures and video?  And was Tamerlan run over by the cops, or shot, or what?  How did he get that MASSIVE hole in his chest?</p></li>
<li><p>If Dzhokar was bleeding before hiding in the boat, how did police, and specifically their dogs, miss the blood trail?  Of course, he might not have been bleeding badly at that point, but wouldn&#39;t a trained police dog be able to pick up the scent of a wounded person trampling through back yards?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did the brothers tell the person they carjacked that they were the bombers, and then let this random guy escape at the gas station?  Where is his interview, or gas station footage?</p></li>
<li><p>When was Dzhokar wounded?  I heard someone say the cops fired on the boat when they first got there.  Why would you shoot randomly when you aren&#39;t even sure if it&#39;s the suspect in there?  It could be a hobo.  If you are worried about a suicide vest or gasoline in the engine, that seems a good way to detonate it.  Sounds like they wanted him wounded or dead.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, and maybe this is my lack of google-fu, but where is ANY evidence, video or still, that proves anything except that the Tsarnaevs were at the Marathon, near the explosion, and had backpacks.  The photo that supposedly shows Dzhokar &quot;casually walking away while people run in panic&quot; shows him looking alarmed and pumping his arms, running the same direction as everyone else.  In that very picture, there&#39;s a bunch of people who are looking back at the blast, walking, standing around confused, even one guy that could damn well be smiling.  I don&#39;t necessarily doubt that they planted the bombs, but at the same time, I haven&#39;t seen nearly enough to pick them out of thousands and call them the prime suspects.  As it&#39;s been said before, other backpacks fit the bomb backpack better than theirs.  And supposedly the FBI-Tamerlan connection didn&#39;t come til later.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Ok, now a lot of the evidence I&#39;m asking for might not have been released because it wasn&#39;t necessary for public safety, and they are holding it for the trial.  Can&#39;t expect the FBI to post gas station security cam footage on YouTube immediately.  But this was such a PUBLIC crime, and yet there are so many blanks and broken links in the current narrative, it&#39;s amazing that they haven&#39;t been filled in.  Hopefully you guys have some logical answers to at least a few of these points.</p>

<p>Finally, do me a favor: if you don&#39;t have something useful to share, don&#39;t post.  I really am not interested in hearing about how the Jew Bankers are clearly behind this.  I don&#39;t fucking know, maybe it really is some Satanic boy-raping cult, but let&#39;s keep this focused.  Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I wondered too.  I understand that this is a different situation than just a normal police chase and they were worried he might have explosives on him.  But how do the police get in a situation where they are able to kill one of the brothers, but then the other one evades them for another 10 hours (that time could be wrong).  Whenever you see chases on television as soon as they have the chopper out its over, the suspect has nowhere to go.  So what happened in Watertown?  They had like 3 choppers and 9000 police.  Granted during the initial chase they didn&#39;t have the city on full lockdown yet (I don&#39;t think) but they still had, as you said, dozens of cops after him.  And a chopper!!!!  How do you evade the chopper???  When they already see you?</p>

<p>I was first wondering what the capabilities of a dog like that were, here&#39;s an article: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/underdogs/the-bloodhounds-amazing-sense-of-smell/350/">http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/underdogs/the-bloodhounds-amazing-sense-of-smell/350/</a></p>

<p>An excerpt:</p>

<p>&quot;When a bloodhound sniffs a scent article (a piece of clothing or item touched only by the subject), air rushes through its nasal cavity and chemical vapors — or odors — lodge in the mucus and bombard the dog’s scent receptors. Chemical signals are then sent to the olfactory bulb, the part of the brain that analyzes smells, and an “odor image” is created. For the dog, this image is far more detailed than a photograph is for a human. Using the odor image as a reference, the bloodhound is able to locate a subject’s trail, which is made up of a chemical cocktail of scents including breath, sweat vapor, and skin rafts. Once the bloodhound identifies the trail, it will not divert its attention despite being assailed by a multitude of other odors. Only when the dog finds the source of the scent or reaches the end of the trail will it relent. So potent is the drive to track, bloodhounds have been known to stick to a trail for more than 130 miles.&quot;</p>

<p>After they ID&#39;ed Dzokhar it seems like they could&#39;ve obtained something, anything that the dogs could have used to pick up his scent.  The explanation was that too many people were in the area.  But the info on bloodhounds says that once they lock into a particular scent they&#39;re good to go.  At one point over the scanner they also said &quot;Fresh Blood&quot; (I think it was between 4-6AM).</p>

<p>&quot;Why did the brothers tell the person they carjacked that they were the bombers, and then let this random guy escape at the gas station? Where is his interview, or gas station footage?&quot;</p>

<p>Not only that but oddly they told him they wanted to go to New York.</p>

<p>The hole in Tamerlan&#39;s chest was from a medical procedure (I think they actually reach in and try to pump the heart, crazy as it sounds)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.  I feel like if you had Dzokhar&#39;s blood at the scene of the shootout, or anything he&#39;d been wearing, or the car that he had driven in, the dog would be able to get his scent.</p>

<p>Then you walk the dog around Watertown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bloodhounds are really only utilized for wilderness searches, and even then it&#39;s not always successful.</p>

<p>Put them in a semi-urban or urban environment and the chances of him being found are even less. For some anecdotal evidence, watch the Mythbusters episode on Bloodhounds, while the dog performed very well in a rural environment, he did not in an urban environment.</p>

<p>Compound that with the fact that it would be difficult to obtain a good scent article, as far as I&#39;m aware they did not find the car for a good amount of time, the trail would be difficult to find and if he switches cars it&#39;s pretty much game over for finding his trail if he drives for a few minutes. </p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m not sure on this, but I&#39;ve heard conjecture that the pool of blood around him was due to the self-inflicted neck wound from the suicide attempt, but I may be wrong on this. That would help explain a lack of a blood trail anyways.</p>

<p>They could have tried to utilize dogs, but once again in an urban environment with that long of a time-window I would be quite surprised if the Bloodhound found him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I&#39;ve read there was a shootout with the police before he was captured. I believe you could hear the shots during the CNN broadcast but I think he did not come out immediately after the shootout, he stayed in the boat for a little while longer. If I had to guess, he returned fire until he had 1 bullet left, then tried to shoot himself in the back of throat but botched it. Once he realized he wouldn&#39;t bleed out he surrendered.</p>

<p>At the same time there&#39;s other posts on here that tell a different story, this was all merely conjecture on my part and how I imagine the events happened. Until we know more that&#39;s all we can really do, debate and try to get to the bottom of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, I was specifically combing through Reddit to find this discussion. I was actually going to post something similar, until came up on your post on this subreddit, which I would not ordinarily visit. I agree with almost all of your premises/questions, and would like to add a few myself:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Lack of police dashcam videos puts the entire story under suspicion. There were at least three reported shootouts between the police and the two suspects - at the MIT, at the Watertown, and after suspect #2 holed up in the boat. The first two would have been captured by dashcam cameras, while the last one would have been captured by helicopter camera. Where are the god damn videos? I mean, considering that all we the public have thus far is stills and blurry videos of suspects walking around the Marathon event, and looking at the gravity of charges against them, you would think there would be more conclusive video evidence released? I too find the lack of video evidence as #1 red flag.</p>

<p><strong>#2 Red Flag</strong>: The official story is FBI followed up on Russian FSB&#39;s inquiry, interviewed suspect #1 and did not find anything suspicious. The FSB specifically said the guy was Islamic Terrorist, in preparations for something. So they just talk to the guy and that&#39;s it? Not even put him on any sort of list? Isn&#39;t it pretty much their job to do just this? How many inquiries from the FSB do they typically receive? I doubt that it&#39;s a very common occurrence at all. So then, once the bombing happens, and we get the first blurry videos and pictures of &quot;suspects&quot; with requests for help from public, why can&#39;t FBI look at their VERY SHORT list of possible suspects in the area and quickly identify the two, without pleading for public help and further delaying the capture? This simply doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p>

<p><strong>#3 Red Flag</strong>: Suspect #2 was shooting at the police from the boat. As the OP already pointed out, had suspect been alert and prepared to fight back, he would have shot the owner of the boat on two occasions: upon the initial discovery or once the owner brought the ladder to climb up and peek inside the boat. Suspect did not shoot him, not did he attempt to evade and continue running upon discovery. Judging by the amount of blood spilled on the side of that boat ramp, it is apparent the loss of blood was significant. Apparently (if we are to follow the official story), suspect #2 suffered these injuries during the shootout #2. As a result, the suspect #2 had likely been bleeding severely for over 10 hours. It is a miracle that he survived at all, and it&#39;s simply impossible that he would still be putting up a fight, or shooting back at the police in such condition, after all of this blood loss. It&#39;s a very significant inconsistency in the story</p>

<p><strong>#4 Red Flag</strong>: Suspect #2 now &quot;can&#39;t speak&quot;. That&#39;s just it, how likely would it be for this to happen, considering all the other inconsistencies in the &quot;official&quot; story? This just makes it a bit more suspicious to me. </p>

<p><strong>#5 Red Flag</strong>: The killing of the MIT security guard. Why wasn&#39;t his patrol car taken, if the two suspects shortly thereafter carried out a carjacking? It seems they needed the second vehicle. Note that they did not immediately ditch their old car, in an attempt to evade, but rather continued driving both cars. One logical explanation to this would be, the suspects wanted to split up and possibly flee the area? Why would they waste time by taking the carjack victim to the ATM and wasting all this time, risking to be caught in the process? Why would they need the $300 (ATM limit) so badly? Why did they let the carjacking victim go unharmed? What are the chances of the 7-11 being robbed at the same time? I mean, the official story becomes less and less plausible with each turn.</p>

<p><strong>#6 Red Flag</strong>: During the first shootout with the police it was reported that the suspects were throwing these hand made explosive devices (3 out of 5 devices detonated) at the two or three responding units, and spraying them with bullets for like 10 minutes. Only one police officer got shot in the abdomen (recently upgraded to critical condition I believe?) One would expect there to be more injuries involved. I mean, obviously everyone is glad no one else got hurt, but the story is once again pretty hard to believe. With suspect #1 at some point coming out from behind the car and just walking toward the police officers, shooting, and he did not get shot right there and then? And what about running out of ammunition mere 5 feet away from the officers? Really? And then immediately getting jumped by the officers and subdued so easily, like he&#39;s not even a 200 lbs boxer? Did he not put up a fight at all, it seems? Is that the story here?</p>

<p><strong>#7 Red Flag</strong>: Social media accounts of the two suspects are still open and accessible to everyone? Really? Isn&#39;t that even a bit strange? I speak and read Russian, and have gone through all of their online posts. They have memes with cats and other very very childish stuff there. These do not look like Islamists to me at all. Yes, there are Islamist materials &quot;liked&quot; and linked, but even those are pretty mild. I mean, there are some hardcore clips you can find on the Internet, if you are really into this sort of stuff. Like American convoys being blown up, followed by video prayers, etc. None of that was there. None of the chopping of the heads, nothing even with guns or AKs pictured. Just prayer stuff, and some very comical, like hating on Harry Potter and stuff. Social media accounts only raise more questions.</p>

<p><strong>#8 Red Flag</strong>: Last but not least, I am myself ethnic russian american, and I speak and read fluent russian. The media reports of what suspect&#39;s father said were all wrong. Not just badly interpreted or translated but basically completely different story was given, from what he said. I won&#39;t get into the details here, but one the first things that made me extremely suspicious of the official story (in addition to the lack of any video evidence), were the gaps between what&#39;s reported in Russian and American news sources.</p>

<p>In any case, I am glad I found this thread, looking forward to carrying on this discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The father basically said that he has no idea what&#39;s going on, and that everything he learned was from TV. I guess their aunt (the woman from Toronto, who is his sister, apparently) called him and told him to turn on TV. So he did and started learning about what was going on. He said, he regretted that his sons had to live like refugees in another country. Then he went on a long discussion about how Chechen people are being prosecuted everywhere they go, and their family had to be on the run all the time, just to save their lives. This is why, he explained, his kids had to travel to America, to save themselves from prosecution in the former Soviet Union republics. Some of that may be true. Some of what their father said also made me believe that he worked for Dudaev (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzhokhar_Dudayev">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzhokhar_Dudayev</a>). Dudaev tried to make Chechnya an independent republic, and the separatist conflict started at that time. Apparently, the father worked for Dudaev&#39;s government, and once Putin and his people had invaded the republic of Chechnya, and installed their own Moscow controlled leader Akhmad Kadyrov (who was subsequently assassinated, and now his son Ramzan Kadyrov heads up the government), the FSB and the Russian special forces were trying to catch EVERYONE who was associated with Dudaev&#39;s government. That was the father&#39;s claim. So they had to leave Chechnya and flee to bordering Kyrgizstan, while he had to send his then-minor sons aged 8 and 15 to Turkey. Father claims that &quot;Putin&#39;s thugs&quot; somehow found his sons in America and either set them up or killed them. He also said his kids never even seen guns, they would not even know how to use guns, etc. He never threatened for the &quot;hell to break loose&quot; if the younger son were killed. I&#39;ve watched all the interviews, and he never said that. However, his claims that Putin&#39;s people setup him sons here in America are rather improbable as well. I&#39;ve considered it, and there is no way this is possible. If Putin&#39;s people are after his family with some sort of personal vendetta, the father himself would be killed long time ago, as well as his two sons (the two bombing suspects). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Point 1 - It&#39;s only been a few days and many of these things are likely needed as evidence in the trial. Them not satisfying your morbid curiosity does not automatically point to a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Point 2 - You may have unrealistic views of what the FBI actually does. They don&#39;t tail ever lead for years and years, waiting for something out of the ordinary to happen. If the stories are accurate, they questioned the older brother and had no reason to believe that he was a major threat. You may also have the motive for releasing the pictures mixed up. An article recently made the front page that talked about how they wanted to get the pictures out so that internet detectives would leave innocent people alone. Thanks to rampant red circles and arrows, people that went to a major event with backpacks were being labeled as terrorists.</p>

<p>Point 3 - The account that I heard was that he saw the disturbed tarp on the boat, found blood, and noticed a sleeping/passed out individual hiding in there. I don&#39;t know much about a shootout between the suspect and officers at the boat scene so I&#39;m anxious for more information on that. I&#39;ve heard of rubber bullets and flashbangs being used but don&#39;t know what to believe at this point. So many people criticize CNN for reporting false info for the sake of being first and then build their elaborate theories around that same misinformation. We need to realize that the first accounts to hit the press are not always the correct ones. If the official story has holes in it, then I&#39;ll take issue with these events. I&#39;d prefer not to speculate too wildly on the initial wave of information.</p>

<p>Point 4 - He needed medical assistance and what they did probably saved his life. They&#39;re trained medical professionals that routinely deal with people on the brink of death. Until I hear otherwise (from a qualified person), I will assume that it was necessary. Furthermore, if you think they did it solely to silence him, why wouldn&#39;t they blow his hands off so that he can&#39;t write? Or just kill him? If they killed him, people would say they tied up loose ends. When they don&#39;t, they still find a way to silence them. Or they didn&#39;t kill him because that would be too obvious. There&#39;s no appeasing people like that.</p>

<p>Point 5 - Stealing a police car is not the best way to go unnoticed. If you&#39;re trying to flea the area, you don&#39;t want to do it in a stolen police cruiser, especially if the PD has any sort of tracking device on the car (which I can&#39;t confirm to be the case but it would be something to consider if you&#39;re trying to be evasive). I haven&#39;t heard about making the guy take money out of the ATM but, if true, then they probably realized that they would still need cash while on the run. And the 7-11 robbery was misinformation and unrelated. Which is why you shouldn&#39;t get all of your news from some guy listening to a police scanner. There was no discrimination of information to keep things relevant to the case. It was a rough transcript of an entire city of officers and their doings.</p>

<p>Point 6 - This is an extremely weak concern. Not enough people got injured so you don&#39;t believe that a shootout occurred as described? Police aren&#39;t just dumped in a car with no training. They know how to stay moderately safe in situations where they&#39;re being shot at. Furthermore, it was dark. I wouldn&#39;t expect either side to be full of exemplary marksmen. And a 200 pound boxer would stand no chance against a few police officers trying to take him to the ground. Boxers are tough but they&#39;re not superhuman.</p>

<p>Point 7 - Social media accounts are no indication of a person&#39;s inner thoughts and intentions. To pretend otherwise is ridiculous. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve watched some nasty ass pornography but there would be no indication of that on your Facebook page. I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t Tweet out every time you jerk off to some girl taking it up the ass. It doesn&#39;t mean that you don&#39;t do it, it doesn&#39;t mean that you don&#39;t think about it, all you can really gather from it is that people don&#39;t put their entire personality on a webpage. If you won&#39;t reveal your porn habits to friends and family, why would anyone ever reveal some Jihadist plot against America? Because they&#39;re not idiots, obviously.</p>

<p>Point 8 - This is interesting and I do hope you translate for us.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to shit on you (<strong>and I apologize for being harsh at times; I&#39;m looking back and realizing that my attitude was not very appropriate</strong> but it would be quite a task to rework that now), specifically, but a lot of these questions are being raised on the grounds of some real-time live transcription of a police scanner. You&#39;re not the first one to ask and won&#39;t be the last. I just wish people would stop automatically assuming that the first word out of a police officer&#39;s mouth is the accurate story. We&#39;re still in the beginning stages of this ordeal and news outlets are grasping at straws to have some sort of headline, even if it isn&#39;t absolutely accurate.</p>

<p>We can have accurate news or fast news. To guarantee one we have to sacrifice a little on the other. Unfortunately, the market has demanded fast news and CNN, FOX, MSNBC, and local ABC/CBS/NBC affiliates are answering to that demand. In return, we get another exciting episode of the nightly news.</p>

<p>I guess all that I&#39;m asking is that people wait for an official story before discrediting the official story. A police scanner and commercial news sources thirsty for hits in the aftermath of a tragedy are not the official story. That comes later, <em>after</em> the investigation.</p>

<p>Please follow up with that translation. I would definitely enjoy reading/watching that. Also, as more details surface, hopefully there is some resolution to your concerns. I will certainly be following up on these because my speculation is no more valid that your own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally appreciate you taking the time to present a logical explanation to each and every point.  That&#39;s the kind of due diligence that this subreddit needs more of.</p>

<p>The only thing that I would comment on, broadly, is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I guess all that I&#39;m asking is that people wait for an official story before discrediting the official story</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Discrediting, perhaps.  But asking questions?  This is the exact time that these things need to be asked.  Strike while the iron is hot.  Waiting months or years for the evidence to come out during a trial or a congressional inquiry is a bad idea.  By then, there is time to:
1) Doctor, create, or lose evidence to fill in missing pieces
2) Make key witnesses disappear through murder, deportation, intimidation, etc.
3) Perfect the narrative and adjust 1 and 2 as needed.</p>

<p>And more importantly than anything, after a year or several years, most people don&#39;t care.  Even if you proved September 11th was a hoax tomorrow (which I don&#39;t believe), it wouldn&#39;t shake up the USA that much.  Bush and his government are already gone, the Iraq war is over, and the memories are fading.  There would be lots of talk and some criminal charges but it wouldn&#39;t be revolutionary.</p>

<p><strong>The Boston crimes were incredibly public.  The police and media encouraged citizens to &quot;play along&quot;, but now that it&#39;s over they are back to withholding key evidence.  This double-standard is what is spurring so much interest in conspiracy theories.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did watch some nasty ass pornography, damn it. How did you know about it? But seriously, I understand your points. There is zero evidence being released and it certainly feeds all sorts of interpretations of what happened. This is normal. There was a radio talk show here in Florida and they said &quot;they were told&quot; not to speculate about what happened. A woman called in then and said, WTF, is this Venezuela where we don&#39;t have freedom to speak up? I sure hope the government releases evidence soon to put all of this to rest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You bring up good points. To me, I guess a lot of this stuff seems plausible on its&#39; own. And maybe it is when it is all together too, but there is quite a disconnect. It could just be chalked up to the fact that they were bad at what they were trying to do. It really surprises me that they killed the officer but let the man go when they stole his car. He called the cops...though maybe they wanted to have a shoot out with law enforcement. Who knows...it is all speculation at this point.</p>

<p>I agree we don&#39;t have a whole lot of cold hard evidence, but as someone further up mentioned they can&#39;t post it all because of the trial (and I&#39;m sure there are laws about this kind of thing anyway for protecting privacy and whatnot).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well I am patient and hoping videos will be made public, to put all of these theories to rest. I am just hesitant to believe everything I am told. this has got nothing to do with not believing government or police, but one has to draw a line somewhere. if they want me to believe their version, they would just have to convince me I guess.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. I&#39;m not big on conspiracy theories either and I don&#39;t worry about the government overstepping the line. I think this awful shit more than likely really did happen and was perpetrated by these two. I just want to understand why, especially in the case of the younger one who seemingly fit in here pretty well. I really am hoping we eventually get some real closure, though I doubt it will be any time soon. These trials always drag out for years don&#39;t they? 
Honestly, I want to know what we as a nation can do better to not only prevent these kind of incidents, but to change the mentality behind the acts too. That&#39;s what bothers me the most. </p>

<p>BTW, thanks for the translation! That bit was quite interesting. I wonder why they&#39;d change it so much...it isn&#39;t like the language is archaic and spoken by few these days.</p>

<li><p>The saudi that was a personof interest was cleared by the FBI. The reason he was brought up again was because of Steve Emerson on Fox News saying he was being deported. Steve came on the day after saying his source was wrong, and that a different guy with a similar name was the one being deported.</p></li>
<li><p>Not sure</p></li>
<li><p>My guess is that they knew they did it from the pictures and videos, but were not able to match a name to the face. IIRC they released the photos asking if anyone could ID them</p></li>
<li><p>The massive hole in his chest was from an emergency surgery to try and keep him alive. They cut a hole and manually try and massage the heart back alive. I&#39;m trying to find the correct term for the surgery.</p></li>
<li><p>Your guess is as good as mine, not really enough info to decide on that though.</p></li>
<li><p>Is there any legit source saying this or is it just speculation?</p></li>
<li><p>He was most likely wounded in the shootout when his brother was killed. He was in a car gunning it at the police barricade to get away, I would guess they tried to shoot him at that point. They did not open fire on him when he was in the boat, unless I missed it on the police scanner along with the thousand others listening in.</p></li>
<li><p>I have not seen any evidence but they cannot just release everything they have, they need to keep it out of the public for the trial. Witnesses cannot see the evidence before hand, along with if a jury is needed. If you release the evidence beforehand then the jury does not have an unbiased view of it. There are legal precedents as to why it is not released.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>The surgery is called a chest thoracotomy, aka &quot;cracking the chest&quot;. This is a commonly performed surgical procedure performed at level 1 trauma centers for penetrating chest or abdominal injuries associated with a loss of vital signs. The aorta is typically cross-clamped which essentially keeps blood only pumping in the upper part of the body (head, upper extremities, and heart). The heart can be manually massaged or defibrillated directly and epinephrine can be injected into the heart muscle as well. There is obviously a very high mortality associated with the procedure as the patients are essentially dead before you start it. The large left-sided chest wound is from this procedure and was not there when the guy arrived at the hospital.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know the video of one of them dropping the bomb will be used in court, from the Lord and Taylor security camera. Also my main point in other comments has been that the police will not release all the evidence til after the trial. They need to preserve some of it so jurors cannot see it ahead of time, along with false witnesses. I think we will see ballistic evidence once it is allowed to be released. I&#39;m sure there is a pile of it waiting to be used for trial, they just never release it before hand.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t personally think there is any conspiracy in this, but I really enjoy having a good conversation with someone from a different viewpoint. Hope that didn&#39;t come off as dickish or anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My gut reaction is that the Tsarnaev&#39;s are, in fact, guilty of planting the bombs.</p>

<p>I&#39;m more concerned about WHY.  If anything, this attack is only going to hurt Chechens and muslims.  It seems idiotic.  Russia has the most to gain from all this.  It&#39;s just weird.  I appreciate your input, it&#39;s not good to let people run wild with crazy theories when there is a simple answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree, I want to know Why. Luckily they were able to take him alive instead of killing him before he could talk, I was worried for a bit there. And yeah, sometimes it is the simplest explanation, it can just be hard to see it sometimes. I really do hope a lot more comes out in the coming months, and the trial should be very interesting. I know one report was released today or yesterday detailing the charges and extent of his injuries. I just hope he makes a recovery and can tell his thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was also so easy to just cordon off the area of Watertown, shut down the cell service, so no live footage or pictures are leaked. It was also a no-fly area, so no news helicopters were allowed. This was the least transparent &quot;capture&quot; effort I have seen here. The police basically presented their narrative as evidence and everyone chanted. I am all for capturing terrorists and finding those responsible for the heinous acts of bombing the marathon, but these black out tactics are very suspect to me. Especially considering all other gaps in the official story. I was laughing out loud, when CNN and others had to go overboard with Google Maps imagery, because there was ZERO footage or photographic evidence presented by the police...You could tell even the news reporters are struggling with lack of details</p>

<p>1) they have the most to gain from swaying public opinion</p>

<p>2) what do all these employed people do all day in the CIA? NSA? DHS? Pentagon? They don&#39;t seem to stop many attacks. And if we&#39;re trillions in debt, why not stop giving them so much money? It is clear there is an information war going on and the more time you spend here the more you&#39;ll notice.</p>

The media makes us believe that they had multiple shoot outs with the police, they were throwing hand grenades in residential areas and and throwing homemade explosives. Where is all this stuff I can see ditching the explosives and grenades. But the guns and ammunition you just don&#39;t drop that with out someone noticing and to have a prolonged firefight they would need some type of tactical gear to hold magazines and whatnot.

    <div class="md"><p>I was watching news coverage and listening to the scanner while the chase was happening. If I remember correctly the original reports were that they stopped at the 7-11 to refuel. I think the real question becomes, if they had guns how did their hostage escape, and why did they let him run?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>About the naked man:  I do think that he was some random arrested after Tamerlan was already shot, run over, and taken to the hospital.  I was up with the scanner, so that&#39;s how it came out then.  Also, the naked man has a bare chest.  The photo of the deceased Tamerlan shows him with a hairy chest, and in fact all of the shirtless photos of Tamerlan that I have seen show him with a hairy chest.  </p>

<p>My main interest is in another one of your points. Law enforcement had the images of the Tsarnaevs a day before they released them to the public. It looks like the AP was reporting about the Lord and Taylor video by 2 pm on Wednesday. This was more than twenty-four hours before the FBI public release of the Lord and Taylor images. What were they doing with the Lord and Taylor video in that twenty-four hours? Should I just think that they didn&#39;t share the video with FBI officers who work in the Boston area? Or should I just think that the FBI officers who got familiar with Tamerlan and his family in 2011 saw the video, but just didn&#39;t recognize the Tsarnaevs?  Maybe we need these officers to tell us what exactly is involved in the kind of background check that they did so we can be assured in some way that they could have easily forgotten what Tamerlan looked like.</p>

<p>I am obviously bracketing (but not necessarily disbelieving) Zubeidat&#39;s claims about the FBI being continually in contact with Tamerlan.  </p>

<p>Good call.  Maybe that&#39;s why they thought naked man was Tamerlan; since he had the same athletic build.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What were they doing with the Lord and Taylor video in that twenty-four hours? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly.  One of the things I have to consider is that a 24 hour delay gives you enough time to have the best photoshoppers in the world go to work doctoring photos.  </p>

<p>And how many terror suspects do they have in the Boston FBI office database?  A few thousand?  I would think they would make that match pretty quickly.  Maybe the glasses threw them off, though?  Because Dzhokar was the one you could see clearly, but he wasn&#39;t the one the FBI interviewed.</p>

One thing that bugs me is that there were two explosions but only one picture of shattered backpack is all over the internet. There&#39;s a possibility that they could not locate the other backpack, but I started to think what if the bombs were not in the backpack? And judging from the surveillance camera video, I think Tamerlan&#39;s backpack is too thin if there really was a pressure cooker inside..</p>

<p>This is another angle I&#39;ve been thinking about.  How big and heavy would a pressure cooker bomb be?  Wouldn&#39;t it pull on Dzarkhov&#39;s shoulder, since he has it on with one strap?  Wouldn&#39;t they walk a little funny?  I&#39;d like to see that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re right.  I was forgetting how difficult it is t make out any of Tamerlan&#39;s facial features from the Lord and Taylor images.  If the FBI didn&#39;t have anything better than what they showed us, if they weren&#39;t in fact in continuous contact with Tamerlan, and if they had no significant contact with Dzhokhar, it makes sense that the Boston field officers who had spoken with Tamerlan in 2011 would not recognize him from those images.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>really? now, realistically, how many FSB reported islamic jihadists live in the Boston area? it&#39;s not like his picture was in a paper file somewhere, along with his profile. it&#39;s was in a database, and it would certainly also have information on his younger sibling there as well. even a simple query to database was likely to return him and his brother as possible matches. This entire line of thinking emerging now, that FBI were not on the ball from the get go, and continued to overlook the evidence they already had. Why? Now one suspect is dead, the other can&#39;t talk, and there is no video evidence released of anything at all. I can&#39;t believe more people are not asking these questions!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does seem like the dozen or so people who they had scanning images from the Marathon to find the Tsarnaevs should have then been tasked with comparing the Lord and Taylor images to those of every person who had been questioned for ties to terrorism in the Boston area.  If they only had pictures of Tamerlan in their database, and not of Dzhokhar, and if they had no images superior to those released to the public, it is still possible that they could have overlooked him.  Nonetheless, the oddness of this does match with the oddness of the parents&#39; statements.  I would like the FBI to say something about what exactly was involved in their background check and whether they had images of Dzhokhar on file as a result of it.  </p>

<p>And I totally agree with you about the 7-11 part of the story.  We are being asked to believe an amazing coincidence. The resemblance between the naked man and Tamerlan is another one.  Coincidences do happen, but they make narratives less believable as they pile up.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the deceased Tamerlan&#39;s chest was <em>that</em> hairy. In fact it looks considerably less hairy than it does in <a href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8266/8663939862_76e3ea1190_b.jpg">this photo</a> (some fighters shave their body hair). I think it&#39;s possible that the resolution of the &quot;naked man&quot; footage is just not high enough, or the lighting too harsh to show the body hair. </p>

<p>I mean, damn, but does that guy look like Tameralan. Haircut, hairline, build, nose shape, face shape, you name it. What percentage of random guys are going to fit that profile so exactly? I go to a boxing gym with hundreds of members, and out of them there&#39;s maybe one guy with that kind of body. Tack that kind of rarity onto all the other similarities between the naked guy and Tamerlan, and I&#39;d have to say it&#39;s very likely him. </p>

<p>I would be very interested though, to actually find out what his family members think. No one can recognize people like family can...</p>

<p>Edit: Here&#39;s that <a href="http://imgur.com/1WgWMQS">close up</a> of the naked man. Look at the low hairline, heavy brow, roman nose, and haircut. The thing that bugs me though is it looks like you can see the exact same five o&#39;clock shadow on both the corpse and the naked man. Soooo...if you can discern a five o&#39;clock shadow in the naked man footage, then why can&#39;t you discern the chest hair? Fuck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agree.  I wish we had a picture of Tamerlan from that night because we have a picture of naked guy with his clothes still on (lying on the ground).  Unfortunately, the &quot;7-11 stillshot&quot; only shows Djokar (with the same grey hoodie he had on when found.  All we need is for the police or news or someone to report who the hell naked guy is, and we can match pics to him and be done with this question.

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, you&#39;re right, Tamerlan was not so hairy that his chest hair had to register in the images if he was the naked man.  And the resemblance is otherwise uncanny.  It is a major coincidence, which is not comfortable.  Is the close up an enhancement of some kind, or is it just a still from the original video?  And, I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t remember who took this video.  Is it one of many, or did just one TV station make it through? </p>

<p>Someone posted this close up.  The resemblance is so striking.  Obviously it could be a coincedence, and most likely is.  But when the coincedences start to add up, it&#39;s awfully strange.</p>

<p>Like, we have video of someone who looks A LOT like Tamerlan being arrested. We do NOT have any footage of Tamerlan is the shootout, or being taken from that scene.</p>

Various sites report that Tsarnaev ran over his brother with an SUV, they also hijacked a mercedes, now where they ridding in 2 separate cars? If so how where they driving, shooting and throwing crock pots out of the window?</p>

<p>Can anyone clarify this? </p>

Could this be the picture quality?  Also, when looking at the image of the blown up back pack, the stripes on the handle look reversed. (Suspect&#39;s being tan with black stripe, blown up bag the opposite). I think this had to be the bag on the ground there, because his brother&#39;s was a black backpack.

<p>I know that the vast majority of people involved- the rank and file police and soldiers- were doing their jobs honestly, to the best of their ability.

    <div class="md"><p>I see a few people on here questioning how they carried all the weapons throughout the car jacking. According to this article one man committed the carjacking, then went to pick up the other who &quot;placed something in the trunk&quot;.
<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/dzhokhar-tsarnaev-complaint-carjacking-charges-boston-bombing-2013-4">http://www.businessinsider.com/dzhokhar-tsarnaev-complaint-carjacking-charges-boston-bombing-2013-4</a></p>

<p>Also everyone has been asking for videos. The thermal helicopter video of them finding Dzhokar was released:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/thermal-imaging-aided-bomb-suspect-arrest-article-1.1322811">http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/thermal-imaging-aided-bomb-suspect-arrest-article-1.1322811</a></p>

<p>As far as Tamerlan&#39;s death is concerned it seems he was shot by police and injured. As they were trying to subdue him his brother attempted to drive the vehicle into the police who moved and allowed him to be run over. This article doesn&#39;t mention that he was shot, but tells of how he was run over:
<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/boston-bombing-suspect-dzokhar-tsarnaev-faces-death-penalty-over-weapon-of-mass-destruction-charge-8581995.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/boston-bombing-suspect-dzokhar-tsarnaev-faces-death-penalty-over-weapon-of-mass-destruction-charge-8581995.html</a></p>

<p>As far as using bloodhounds to track Dzohkar, it would have been practically impossible. He left the scene of shootout#2 in a car. Even if he bled all over the place, there was no trail to follow once he entered a vehicle. I have not heard a good account of how he got from that vehicle to the boat, so I cant comment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget: no mention or photos of the firearms these brothers were supposedly armed with. During the mall shooting out here in Oregon, we heard right away what the shooter was armed with. During Sandy Hook, we knew. These two brothers supposedly had a huge shootout and even carjacked someone, but no mention of what they were armed with. It seems so incredibly weird because the reporters aren&#39;t even asking. After they lifted the shelter in place order there was gunfire. Then all of a sudden suspect#2 is in the boat. Are we to believe that after hiding all day, then being spotted by the owner, that 19 year old is just going to start firing out of the boat?</p>

<p>Nothing about this whole situation makes any sense. Why would they stay in Boston?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was listening to the BPD scanner the night of the chase. I had seen a report of the MIT shooting and instead of my nightly ritual of listening to the PPD scanner, I chose the BPD. I heard cops in a chase, an officer report &quot;we have explosives&quot; another say &quot;there are grenades&quot;. It was all very confusing, no one reporting where they were and everyone sounded like they were on foot. At one point, another officer asks for landmarks. Then the dispatcher reports a stolen black Mercedes. The owner was calling in to report it stolen, he was able to get away when they went in to pay for gas. I remember this because the dispatcher made a point of saying &quot;they paid cash for gas&quot;</p>

<p>Even relistenng to the scanner, it&#39;s very confusing. For awhile they thought they had two in custody.</p>

<p>Interesting to note the explosions on the boat. In the FLIR video it clearly shows two explosions, not sure if those are flash bang grenades or what.</p>

<p>Dzhokar is speaking however. LA Times reported he was cursing during his ambulance ride and yesterday while they read his Miranda rights he did answer &quot;no&quot; to one of the questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found it really crazy that they were throwing flash-bangs into the boat.  Like, that is NOT how they are designed to be used.  Throwing a FB into such a small compartment, right next to a wounded person, is extremely dangerous.</p>

<p>It seemed unnecessary at that point, and there were other techniques that could have been used.</p>

<p>Again though, this isn&#39;t stuff I consider &#39;conspiracy&#39; as much as I consider it to be angry, adrenaline-fueled police wanting to fuck up the suspect as much as they legally could.</p>

<p>[1]
So, this article&#39;s time line is STILL indicating that significant time had elapsed between when law enforcement (a) had photos of the suspects, (b) when after some debate they decided to release those photos, and (c) when they LEARNED of the identities of the men in the photos. How exactly could it possibly be that the FBI, which investigated and INTERVIEWED IN PERSON the older Tsarnaev brother, didn&#39;t have one of those agents identify the man the moment the picture was obtained? Everyone in America was looking at those faces and FBI agents who actually invested time investigating him in connection with alleged Islamic radical activities and meeting with him just drew a blank?!?</p>

<p>The FBI angle is very interesting on many levels. Unfortunately, the most obvious implication is that ten years after 9/11 the US intelligence community royally failed to connect the dots when the investigated him and completely fumbled during the initial stages of the identification process after the bombing by failing to put a name to the face, a face that had already been on their radar screen.</p>

<p>The pieces of the puzzle of this evolving story, however, also point to other interesting and disturbing possibilities. What government was it that pointed its finger at Tamerlan Tsarnaev, what was the information provided, how thorough was the FBI investigation, what was in the report provided to the foreign government, why did the foreign government not follow up, and was the FBI really continually monitoring the family over the course of several years, as the suspects&#39; parents have claimed? Most recent information suggests that it was the Russian government and that the request was made in connection with allegations by Russian special services that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was engaging with radical Islamic elements in the Russian North Caucuses. We still don&#39;t know the extent and depth of the information provided or why the FBI, after handing over their initial report to the Russians and did not get a follow up, gave up. These questions will have to be asked of both -- the Russians and the FBI, as well as the VIA which has a counterterrorism function and is the US spy agency responsible for operations abroad. The NSA, which is responsible for monitoring electronic communications, should be prepared to give account as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>[2]
Various relatives of the Tsarnaev brothers have vocally claimed a set-up. They did not point fingers at any particular group or entity. Their claim arose from the disbelief that the two men could have perpetrated such an atrocious rampage, as well as personal experience and knowledge of how such things have transpired in Russia so many times over the course of the past two decades. Sadly, this modus operandi that took most Americans by surprise and shocked the conscience of the nation, is known all too well to those in Russia ad has far less shock value. Is it possible that the Tsarnaev brothers were &quot;framed&quot;? It is possible, at least in some respects. Bearing in mind that all that the public knows thus far consists of often conflicting law enforcement releases and wildly gyrating media reports, one could certainly come up with a plethora of theories that would at least meet the exacting standards of TV dramas like 24 and The Americans. The term &quot;to frame&quot; can mean a lot of different things -- from outright implication of completely innocent persons to manipulating the scenario so that it appears to be the work of a lone wolf duo and shields other co-conspirators. Notably, in the multitude of similar acts in Russia itself, the actual perpetrators are often found dead under &quot;mysterious circumstances&quot; shortly after the terrorist act, or, even if caught and put on trial, are unable to lead investigation to the higher-ups.</p>

<p>An intelligent investigation of this rampage must focus not only on the &quot;when&quot; and &quot;how&quot; but perhaps most importantly on the &quot;why&quot; and the &quot;who&quot;. A gaping hole in this analysis provided to the American people thus far is the motivation that Chechen separatists would have had to initiate a terrorist act in the United States. The simple (or rather the simpleton) analysis just says that they are Muslim radicals and that all Muslim radicals are alike. In reality, nothing could be further from the truth. There is a great deal of variation among people that identify themselves as Muslims -- across regional, racial, ethnic, linguistic, economic, and other criteria. The most obvious &quot;divide&quot; is arguably between the Sunni and Shia Muslims. But even within the Sunni and Shia branches of Islam there are massive differences. This should not be a shock to anyone. The same thing is true if every other religion with widely dispersed following. Take a Jew from the Borough Park community in Brooklyn, New York and put him or her in a room with a Jew from Dagestan, Russia and another Jew from Ethiopia, and the three will likely very little in common in the great scheme of things. Likewise, there is a great deal of variation among Muslim groups that hold radical beliefs and agendas.</p>

<p>To understand the Chechens and other peoples of the North Caucuses region takes quite a bit more than making broad generalizations about Muslims or &quot;the Russians&quot;. Insofar as any possible animosity towards the United States from Chechen Islamic separatists (or more broadly any Islamic separatists from the North Caucuses), one would expect the opposite. United States foreign policy has generally been quite benign towards the Chechen people and often quite critical of the Russian government&#39;s campaigns of suppression and repression in Chechnya. An admittedly broad analogy of US policy towards the Chechens over the past two decades would liken it to US policy towards the Afghanistan Mujahideen during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. It would be incredibly naive to dismiss the idea that US intelligence agencies will look hard into whether Russian intelligence services or some renegade factions thereof or other factions in Russia may have been behind this whole sordid affair, at least to some extent.</p>

<p>Remember, similar terrorist acts in Moscow and other regions of Russia served as the pretext for a massive invasion of Chechnya by the Russian military in 1999. Various analysts and insiders, including former Russian intelligence officer Alexander Litvinenko, claimed that it was in fact the Russian special services that orchestrated the terrorists acts to rally public support behind the new war and the then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>During his time in London, Litvinenko wrote two books, Blowing Up Russia: Terror from Within and Lubyanka Criminal Group, wherein he accused Russian secret services of staging the Russian apartment bombings and other terrorism acts in an effort to bring Vladimir Putin to power. He also accused Putin of ordering the October 2006 murder of Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, a woman who made a career of exposing systemic abuses by Russian authorities of the civilian population in Chechnya and elsewhere in the North Caucuses.
On November 1, 2006, Litvinenko suddenly fell ill and was hospitalized in what was established as a case of poisoning by radioactive Polonium-210 which resulted in his death on 23 November. The events leading up to this are a matter of controversy, spawning numerous theories relating to his poisoning and death. The British investigation into his death resulted in a failed request to Russia for the extradition of Andrey Lugovoy whom they accused of Litvinenko&#39;s murder. Two things were undisputed. Polonium-210 isn&#39;t something that just anyone can come by and its traces and radiation were found on the British Airways plane that brought another former Russian intelligence agent from Moscow to London where he met with Litvinenko.</p>

<p>Reverting to the Boston bombing and the events that preceded and followed it, there is no obvious motivation for a group motivated by Chechen separatist/nationalist ideology to attack the US, since the US has been quite favorable towards the Chechens and sympathetic towards their struggles with Russia-proper. The pattern of events is also highly suspect. A terrorist act, followed by a murder, followed by a carjacking and a 7/11 convenience store robbery? It could be exactly as the media has reported it but it is nonetheless very odd.</p>

<p>On the one hand, if indeed the Tsarnaev brothers acted alone, it is possible that this was more similar to the Columbine shooting in terms of motivation, that an actual terrorist act motivated by political or Jihadist ideology. But this theme has not yet been explored at all by mainstream media and law enforcement, even though there has been a lot of chatter about how maladjusted in America the older Tsarnaev brother was.</p>

<p>The other very plausible explanation, which has also been ignored by mainstream media and not touched by US officials with a ten foot pole, is that the trail may lead to Russian (or other post-Soviet) special services, former special services, or such elements as the faction of the Kremlin-appointed Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. All of the above would have much more political capital to gain from an attack that is fashioned to look like a radical Islamic Chechen attack on America that any of the actual Chechen separatist groups. It is even possible that the trail would go all the way to the top, to the grey little man in the Kremlin. What kind of political capital and why? In the interest of brevity consider just one angle -- Syria. A Muslim country with significant strategic importance, where a secular regime that the US &quot;doesn&#39;t like&quot; is battling it out with an insurgency that the US &quot;does like&quot;. The leader of the regime whom the US &quot;doesn&#39;t like&quot; has warned that if the regime falls, the West will see the insurgency turn on it in a jiffy, and that this will be by orders of magnitude worse than the outcomes in Afghanistan (the &quot;birth&quot; of Bin Laden) and Libya. &quot;The West has paid heavily for funding al Qaeda in its early stages. Today it is doing the same in Syria, Libya and other places, and will pay a heavy price in the heart of Europe and the United States,&quot; al-Assad said, according to a CNN translation. Yet, as CNN reported on April 11th in an article by Barbara Star &quot;Under pressure from Democrats and Republicans, the Joint Staff of the Pentagon and the U.S. Central Command have updated potential military options for intervention in Syria that could see American forces - if ordered - doing everything from bombing Syrian airfields to flying large amounts of humanitarian aid to the region, a senior U.S. military official said.&quot; A day earlier CNN&#39;s Peter Bergen wrote: &quot;On Tuesday, al Qaeda&#39;s affiliate in Iraq announced that it had merged with the Syrian opposition group Jabhat al-Nusra to form the &#39;Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.&#39; The announcement came in the form of an audio message from the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, Sheikh Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, that was distributed to key jihadist websites.&quot; But on April 19th CNN&#39;s Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr reported: &quot;In a critical indication of growing U.S. military involvement in the civil war in Syria, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has ordered the deployment of more American troops to Jordan. Hagel announced the deployment, which was first reported on CNN, in a statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday. He said the troops will work alongside Jordanian forces to &#39;improve readiness and prepare for a number of scenarios.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>How is this relevant to &quot;political capital&quot; as it relates to Russia? Well, Russia has been a vigorous supporter of the al-Assad regime in Syria and has warned the West numerous times that supporting the insurgency would backfire on the West, citing its own experience with the Chechen insurgency as an example. How convenient that just as the US seems to be stepping up its &quot;growing U.S. military involvement in the civil war in Syria&quot;, the Boston bombing provides such a convenient, timely and obvious &quot;I told you so&quot; argument for Mr. Putin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a similar analysis of the situation, especially that the major question is WHY?</p>

<p>There is a mountain of evidence that shows that Putin and the Russian FSB were : involved in planning some of these terrorist attacks; funded/equipped/ or merely were complicit in them; used brutal tactics that ratcheted up the level of violence at the cost of hundreds of Russian lives, including children; AND covered up this involvement, including murdering journalists, witnesses, and whistleblowers.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if the Syria angle is the right one... there&#39;s a lot of possible angles as both the US and Russia have their tentacles in many places, but it would not surprise me at all if the Kremlin had a hand in this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Russian angle is what got me interested in the first place.  The FSB is just about the shadiest motherfuckers in the world.   And who benefits from all this more than Vladimir Putin?  He is going to have the green light from the US for another crackdown in Chechnya.</p>

<p>It makes for a much stronger motive than &quot;we hate America&quot;.  This could be as simple as the FSB threatening to kidnap and torture Tamerlan&#39;s family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the Russian angle is quite shady here. I would even say unprecedented. Nothing adds up. If Russians were really after Tamerlan, why did he travel to Russia last year? FSB would have picked him up at Sheremet&#39;evo airport immediately after his arrival - they don&#39;t fuck around like the FBI does here. Unless FSB were expecting him, maybe even training him there? Tamerlan&#39;s mother and father are within FSB&#39;s reach - his father is in Kyrgyzstan, while his mother is in Dagestan. Both geographies are firmly within FSB&#39;s area of influence. It appears Tamerlan&#39;s father was working in the government of Dudaev (first Chechen president [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzhokhar_Dudayev%5D">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzhokhar_Dudayev]</a>) and Russian special forces and FSB are sweeping everyone who&#39;s ever been involved with Dudaev. So then why would FSB reach out to FBI about this, if they probably knew that FBI would be very skeptical and non-cooperative? It&#39;s puzzling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, but Chechens were typically neutral as far as America is concerned. their enemy is Russia and Putin&#39;s government. it would seem, by terrorizing America, Chechens would lose a possible ally. Russia would also gain upper hand by saying, you see, we told you so. Chechens are also not at all related to AlQaeda, they just want independence for their own state, nothing more (as far as I am aware)...</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve read, that may not be true any more.  There is some evidence that Chechens have been more radicalized.  But who knows, there are a lot of small groups with different ideologies, perhaps some are receiving aid for Al Qaeda.  Maybe it&#39;s Russian propaganda to smear the Chechens.</p>

<p>But yes, by attacking the USA, Chechens will lose any American support they had, and Putin will be more able to kill them with impunity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>there are all sorts of freelancing fighters than go to rebelling states to help out with the uprising. there could possibly be AlQaeda linked fighters hiding around Chechnya, but probably very few if any.

    <div class="md"><p>The father basically said that he has no idea what&#39;s going on, and that everything he learned was from TV. I guess their aunt (the woman from Toronto, who is his sister, apparently) called him and told him to turn on TV. So he did and started learning about what was going on. He said, he regretted that his sons had to live like refugees in another country. Then he went on a long discussion about how Chechen people are being prosecuted everywhere they go, and their family had to be on the run all the time, just to save their lives. This is why, he explained, his kids had to travel to America, to save themselves from prosecution in the former Soviet Union republics. Some of that may be true. Some of what their father said also made me believe that he worked for Dudaev (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzhokhar_Dudayev">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzhokhar_Dudayev</a>). Dudaev tried to make Chechnya an independent republic, and the separatist conflict started at that time. Apparently, the father worked for Dudaev&#39;s government, and once Putin and his people had invaded the republic of Chechnya, and installed their own Moscow controlled leader Akhmad Kadyrov (who was subsequently assassinated, and now his son Ramzan Kadyrov heads up the government), the FSB and the Russian special forces were trying to catch EVERYONE who was associated with Dudaev&#39;s government. That was the father&#39;s claim. So they had to leave Chechnya and flee to bordering Kyrgizstan, while he had to send his then-minor sons aged 8 and 15 to Turkey. Father claims that &quot;Putin&#39;s thugs&quot; somehow found his sons in America and either set them up or killed them. He also said his kids never even seen guns, they would not even know how to use guns, etc. He never threatened for the &quot;hell to break loose&quot; if the younger son were killed. I&#39;ve watched all the interviews, and he never said that. However, his claims that Putin&#39;s people setup him sons here in America are rather improbable as well. I&#39;ve considered it, and there is no way this is possible. If Putin&#39;s people are after his family with some sort of personal vendetta, the father himself would be killed long time ago, as well as his two sons (the two bombing suspects). </p>

<p>I know that the vast majority of people involved- the rank and file police and soldiers- were doing their jobs honestly, to the best of their ability.  There aren&#39;t enough smart people who can keep their mouth shut to stage a massive farce like some people are saying.  If there is a conspiracy, its a handful of people manipulating key moments and pieces of evidence.</p>

<p>Mostly I am interested in what the motive was.</p>
