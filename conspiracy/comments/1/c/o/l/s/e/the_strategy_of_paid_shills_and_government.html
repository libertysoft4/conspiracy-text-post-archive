<p>This makes a lot of sense, because they can&#39;t just bury everything here that is exposing conspiracies, but you can give those that are surfing here curiously the impression that this community is full of people who will blindly upvote things without investigating, you&#39;ve done your job. So when these curious people check out the comments for something shocking they think &quot;oh, this guy has debunked this shit&quot;</p>

<p>Another thing they do routinely for this purpose is to pretend they are generally supportive of conspiracy theories but then go on about what a bunch of crap that submission is and that it &quot;discredits us&quot;...</p>

<p>I have a bunch of evidence for this. One indication is that if you compare my link karma to my comment karma you will see an unbelievable discrepancy. I mostly comment here, and often to posts that have received  100-1000 karma points, yet every comment I make is downvoted heavily and some ridiculous argument against me is upvoted to the top. </p>

<p>I decided just for fun to check out the top submission of the day, and lo and behold, this comment has 55 points now: </p>

<p>[–]the_keo 55 points 9 hours ago
Don&#39;t go bringing facts in to the conspiracy parade.
The world is so much more understandable when you just focus on the idea there are grand intersecting conspiracies at work all the time hell bent on killing/controlling/enslaving you.</p>

<p>So, comment shills, do your best...</p>

<p>Two things:</p>

<p>1.  When there nothing big in the news like this, the vast majority of the people here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are the people who are really big into conspiracy/NWO/whatever stuff.  They share the same worldview as you, and thus you get your big upvotes.</p>

<p>However, when something like this happens, links to threads from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> get posted in other subreddits, and this subreddit sees a <strong>HUGE</strong> influx of people that are not of the conspiratorial bent.  These people vastly outnumber you, and they do <em>not</em> share your worldview.  They downvote you heavily.</p>

<p>Why do they downvote you so heavily?  </p>

<p>2.  Just as you feel <strong>EXTREMELY</strong> strongly about how right <em>you</em> are (and how stupid everyone who doesn&#39;t share your opinions are), the opposition <em>also</em> feels <strong>EXTREMELY</strong> strongly about how stupid <em>you</em> are, and how right <em>they</em> are.</p>

<p>TLDR:  When nothing like this is in the news, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media)">echochamber</a>.  When something like this happens, the other people from reddit show up (people who overwhelmingly outnumber you), and vote you down.  </p>

<p><strong>They are not paid government shills.</strong></p>

<p>Besides, where supposedly is the stuff here being crossposted at? It may happen occasionally but definitely not all the stuff that gets on top of this sub. I have not noticed this for any of my submissions f.e.</p>

<p>Tell me about it...</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be honest, your vigilance is so amazing, you are actually getting me in trouble with my superiors (I&#39;m hesitant to give you your props, but they actually mentioned your name specifically...).  Basically, they told me that if I don&#39;t double my efforts, and stop you from unraveling it all, my ass is going to be without a job <em>real</em> soon.</p>

<p>If I had to offer my analysis (and, I know you guys aren&#39;t paying me like the government is, but I respect you as an adversary, so I&#39;m offering this up for free), I&#39;d say that maybe it&#39;s because of two things:</p>

<p>1.  All of these submissions are here on the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> subreddit.  What would be the point in downvoting them?  Even if <em>those</em> submissions go down, the other ones - submissions that are <em>also</em> about these same conspiracy ideas - would just replace them.  That is all that is here!</p>

<p>2.  Here on reddit, a lot of people are in it for the upvotes.  If they downvote the submissions, then no one will get a chance to see their comments (the ones where they ridicule and make fun of you), and they can&#39;t collect their glorious karma.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I gots to get back to my shilling.  The benefits/pension plan here are amazing, and I don&#39;t want to lose them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correlation does not equal causation. Yes the mass influx of people who normally don&#39;t browse <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is present during major events like what has occurred this week.  This does not mean all absurd or &quot;status quo&quot;-type comments are from the influx of &quot;mainstream&quot; users.  You are making an assumption and disguising it as fact.</p>

<p>Some possibilites of the current <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> comment climate:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>influx of &quot;mainstream&quot; users (I hate writing out that term, can anyone think of a better one?)</p></li>
<li><p>influx of trolls from places like <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> </p></li>
<li><p>paid users or mods whose moneyed interests lie in a specific narrative</p></li>
<li><p>a combination of all of the previously mention possibilites along with other the background randomness of the universe</p></li>
<li><p>none of the above and something complete overlooked or unseen as of yet</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Many users may not glean that fact if they are just glancing through comments and upvoting. This is especially so when it is the top-rated comment.  Being a highly-rated and what seems like a logical counter argument may influence some users to blindly upvote without critically analyzing your text.</p>

<p>Also you do not have to claim facts when you are offering a fallacious argument.  Though you also made a really bold (pun  intended?) claim:</p>

<p><strong>They are not paid government shills.</strong></p>

what&#39;s good about reddit is</p>

<ol>
<li>it moves very quickly</li>
<li>there are many people of different skill</li>
<li>you dont need to confirm accounts</li>
<li>it is not restricted to certain countries</li>
<li>they offer strong access to their API (so you can filter the data however you choose, if you want)</li>
<li>it is mostly text based so even viewing behind some TOR or slow VPN is not too bad</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I have noticed behavior similar to what you are describing.</p>

<p>Topics get upvoted but then receive a flood of nonsensical posts.  It looks to be a strategy to make the comments look like background noise or static.  </p>

<p>I especially noticed this in posts that I had sources in.  Not only was I getting often off-topic or ridiculous replies, I was also receiving enough downvotes to keep some of my sourced posts at zero or below.   The downvotes happened especially early on, in what looks like an attempt to bury sourced information before others read the topic. Tactics like this would essentially make a post invisible to users depending on their comment viewing preferences.</p>

<p>I have also noticed highly voted comment submissions that were completely fallacious and looked like they were trying to suppress questioning or any type of thought outside the so called &quot;status quo.&quot;</p>

<p>I should also clarify that I do not think everyone spouting nonsense in this subreddit is paid.  People tend to flock here from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and have strategies to troll and disrupt <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Others come from the front page at times and have people who post knee-jerk reactions along with posts that go strictly with the &quot;status quo&quot; as comments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not bad... I mean you have to try something and I wasn&#39;t exactly making your job easy.</p>

<p>Well then surely you can explain why this new apparent influx of non-conspiracy minded readers don&#39;t also downvote the submission itself? Which seems to keep getting points at a normal rate.</p>

<p>Besides, where supposedly is the stuff here being crossposted at? It may happen occasionally but definitely not all the stuff that gets on top of this sub. I have not noticed this for any of my submissions f.e.</p>

<p>Like I said, not bad, but you have to do better.</p>

<p>I was one of the paid ones... I was mocking you a while back, and I apologize for that..</p>

<p>Now I am on the run</p>

<p>They have gotten control over my brainwaves with nanobots (there is no patent for that stuff, and it makes the recpetion much more potent than old RF mind control technology) ... my will is bearly strong enough to keep on running ( I do it with alot of flax seeds and yoga) </p>

<p>I just wanted to tell you that you are right about all of the mind control stuff</p>

<p>Got to go... you are on the right track.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correlation does not equal causation. Yes the mass influx of people who normally don&#39;t browse <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is present during major events like what has occurred this week.  This does not mean all absurd or &quot;status quo&quot;-type comments are from the influx of &quot;mainstream&quot; users.  You are making an assumption and disguising it as fact.</p>

<p>Some possibilites of the current <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> comment climate:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>influx of &quot;mainstream&quot; users (I hate writing out that term, can anyone think of a better one?)</p></li>
<li><p>influx of trolls from places like <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> </p></li>
<li><p>paid users or mods whose moneyed interests lie in a specific narrative</p></li>
<li><p>a combination of all of the previously mention possibilites along with other the background randomness of the universe</p></li>
<li><p>none of the above and something complete overlooked or unseen as of yet</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So to say its one thing because it is common or commonly believed is <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-common-practice.html">fallacious and ignorant.</a></p>

<p>EDIT: Please respond when you downvote. I&#39;d like to hear your perspective. Sources preferred.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many users may not glean that fact if they are just glancing through comments and upvoting. This is especially so when it is the top-rated comment.  Being a highly-rated and what seems like a logical counter argument may influence some users to blindly upvote without critically analyzing your text.</p>

<p>Also you do not have to claim facts when you are offering a fallacious argument.  Though you also made a really bold (pun  intended?) claim:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>They are not paid government shills.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again anyone glancing through the posts may feel as if you proved the original claim wrong.  I am not crying out foul play but you are not helping rational thought and questioning spread.</p>
