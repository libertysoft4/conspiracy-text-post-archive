    <div class="md"><p>Furthermore, if the &quot;state&quot; asked you to stay in your houses for any other reason than your own safety do you really think freedom loving Americans wouldn&#39;t step up and say fuck that shit. This was the most transparent manhunt in the history of the world and all of the residents gladly stayed inside (and consequently went outside and helped end it) because it was suggested for their safety. With the Internet and cell phone cameras everywhere the police and military can not fuck innocent people for no reason. They can ask for our help and receive it if we don&#39;t believe they are all our enemy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what exactly justifies shutting down a city? This man put a lot of lives at risk. Civilians voluntarily cooperating to return their city to a state of peace and safety is a lot different than the picture you are painting, in my opinion. Imagine living in Watertown and knowing that this disgruntled/heavily armed &quot;teenager&quot; who just lost his closest relative was at large in your backyard. Police are people too, risking THEIR lives for your own. I would do anything to get him into custody and out of the streets as quickly as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&quot;</p>

<p>What this means is that congress can&#39;t make a law abridging the freedom of speech.  There&#39;s the letter of the law, which states that only <em>congress</em> can&#39;t make laws abridging them, there&#39;s nothing to say that an executive order, or a committee, or a city council can&#39;t make a law abridging free speech. Do you need me to post instances of when that&#39;s effectively happened, or are we going to assume you haven&#39;t been under a rock for the last 10 years?</p>

<p>EDIT- that may have sounded like an attack, but it really wasn&#39;t.  It&#39;s just tiring to hear somebody expecting the law to be <em>followed</em> when it very clearly isn&#39;t being followed by the government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An executive order falls within the Presidential Powers in Article II I believe, so the President is given discretion. If he oversteps his powers, Congress and the judicial branch should be there to challenge it. A committee is usually set up by Congress, and this falls within the broad interpretation of the Constitution where Congress is effectively allowing the committees to do such actions. Again, they still have to adhere to case law and precedent. </p>

It doesn&#39;t necessarily mean believe everything hook, line, and sinker.  Of course not.  There&#39;s definitely a lot of hoodwinkery going on and a lot of disinformation agents, etc.  However, at least be open for the fact that a lot of these things that might otherwise be looked upon incredulously by many DO come from a certain core of truth that is indeed hidden from the majority of the public.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCMp9dZQdZA">Intelligent, very technologically advanced beings</a> - many of which are in the bipedal, humanoid shape and are practically indistinguishable in appearance from you or me - DO exist in the cosmos, and some of them are likely here on this planet.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/hidden_hand_081018">There <em>does</em> indeed seem to be an <em>extremely</em> powerful and influential group</a> responsible on this planet for steering things in directions that involve much immediate harm to humans; a group more powerful than many can imagine.  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14utv0/911_was_an_occult_megaritual_the_numbers_of_the_4/c7gwqaz">This group, as well, may not necessarily be from here</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The second bullet point above may or may not be literally true in and of itself.  It does, however, coincide with the existence of various states of events on this planet, so it may be closer to the truth than some might suppose.</p>

<p>Ultimately, just be critical but <em>open</em> to information that you might have otherwise scoffed at because we live in a world that is VERY different than the one we were raised to believe we live in.</p>

<p>And also, as I said in my OP here, don&#39;t be afraid.  It&#39;s easier said than done, but we are all each of us tiny sparks released from an eternal, universal, cosmic fire.  That great fire releases these little sparks of Itself so that It can experience the world from a different perspective is all.  Some of these sparks are big, some small, some &quot;good&quot;, some &quot;bad&quot;.  They all come from IT, however, and That Great Fire does not <em>go out</em>.  It does not extinguish.  As big as the cosmos is, That Great Fire is bigger still...and you, me, and all of us are an integral part of It.</p>

<p>This is not &quot;religious mumbo jumbo&quot;.  This is scientific truth.  It&#39;s already been confirmed.  Everything is one.</p>

<p>WE are The Great Fire.  It&#39;s just that TGF has manifested itself as YOU and ME and all of us <em>individually</em>.  Once that romp through &quot;individuality&quot; is done, that tiny spark of individuality collects itself back into and <em>as</em> The Great Fire - as The Greater Self that it always was from the beginning anyway and all along.  We all go back to it and each other, so there&#39;s really nothing to fear.  What is there to fear? the ending of the current dream that we&#39;re having?</p>

<p>Well, when the dream ends - and it <em>will</em> end - then what happens?</p>

<p>Same thing that happens when the dreams you have at night end.</p>

<p>You wake up.</p>

<p>Not similar haircuts.  Nope.</p>

<p>You can only see half of that guys face, and that at poor resolution.  So nope there.</p>

<p>Aaaaaand white.  Like most of America.</p>

<p>To answer your next questions...no, I don&#39;t think they did it because they thought he was the suspect.  I&#39;ll bet they did it because they were afraid.  Because they didn&#39;t really know what they were looking for.  Police are people (just barely, amirite?), and they get scared too.  Its why you see unreasonable use of force so often, and why they always claim people are approaching them threateningly.  But their fear doesn&#39;t justify stripping some random of his rights.  Just like my fear doesn&#39;t justify governmental stripping of your rights, and vice versa.</p>

<p>That is my <strong>HONEST</strong> opinion.</p>

This is an exercise.  you will see more surveillance cameras and you will be expected to let the cops in your home.

    <div class="md"><p>No. Simply no. This is not a set up, they are actively chasing a terrorist around Boston. And you&#39;re already expected to let cops in your home: it&#39;s called probable cause. According to you theorists, martial law has been coming for forty years. If they wanted it, they&#39;d have a press conference and declare martial law. Hasn&#39;t happened yet, after 911, after this...grow up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>u/nefertooty has the key to that theory. It&#39;s not that they are doing that <em>now</em> that&#39;s the issue. The conspiracy is that more events like this will happen, and more and more searches/huge police presence will serve to desensitize the public to having such procedures followed. They said it themselves (they meaning CNN) earlier today...&quot;this is the future of counterterrorism&quot; (analyst speaking of waiting until later to release photos &amp; lockdowns as needed). Everyone is already on edge and it&#39;s not a far stretch to imagine this happening again in any other major city across the US (and the world, for that matter). The more this happens, the more people will get used to it/expect it until martial law won&#39;t hardly be noticed. It&#39;s like the slow boiling of a frog...the more gradual you turn up the heat, the less the frog will notice anything is wrong until he&#39;s cooked.</p>

<p>Police ordering people inside is in the vicinity of police operations. Not a martial law either; it&#39;s actually been a common practice for ages when armed suspect is around. </p>

<p>In any case it&#39;s not a conspiracy. Just police being cautious. To prevent collateral damage in case there is shooting. Remember the LA manhunt where ooutsiders got shot? That&#39;s not good either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, based on that definition, anytime someone is murdered the government can lock down an entire city until they find the murderer.</p>

<p>&quot;An emergency situation requiring swift action to prevent imminent danger to life or serious damage to property, or to forestall the imminent escape of a suspect, or destruction of evidence.&quot;</p>

<p>More worrisome...</p>

<p>&quot;There is no absolute test for determining if exigent circumstances exist&quot;.</p>

<p>This does not give the government carte blanche to shut down an entire city.  Even without the need of a warrent, they still need probable cause to enter a building.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Using the word exercise doesn&#39;t take out the fact that you said full blown. I can put the word exercise in the quote, and what you said is still hyperbolic. Unless you&#39;re using exercise in the most vague way imaginable, or you don&#39;t understand it, just because you use that word doesn&#39;t change the pretense.

<p>Please enlighten me as to what I said that was hyperbole? If you want to be <strong>that</strong> guy, I quoted you entirely accurate, the same way people are quoted every day. I just only quoted the relevant thing you said, because saying exercise doesn&#39;t change the context of what you said. They didn&#39;t actually declare Martial Law (which I&#39;m assuming is the key to your point,) but that &quot;exercise&quot; (which really was just a state of emergency) was not Martial Law. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think leaving the word &quot;exercise&quot; out of my quote is very misleading.</p>

<p>There is a big difference between &quot;full blown Martial Law exercise&quot; and &quot;full blown Martial Law&quot;.  One is an exercise, and one is not.  One is factual (although descriptive to convey the seriousness of the event) and the other is simply inaccurate. They conjure up very different meanings.  I think the images we&#39;ve all scene back up my &quot;full blown ML exercise&quot; quite nicely.  I don&#39;t think <a href="http://www.infowars.com/battlefield-usa-de-facto-state-of-martial-law-declared-in-boston-pics-from-the-war-zone/">these pictures</a> are out of line with my description of the events.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry if you see it differently, so we&#39;ll have to agree to disagree and let the readers decide for themselves.  This is my opinion after viewing the images, and hearing the live testimony from the people that experienced it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The exercise just means you&#39;re doing the motions without declaring it. It simply wasn&#39;t Martial Law by definition. It was a <strong>very</strong> strict definition of a state of emergency, but Martial Law means something else.</p>

<p>Nearly everyone I know in America is from Boston and was affected by this event, and no one described it such as Martial Law. </p>

<p>I think this much more accurately describes the situation:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency</a></p>

<p>But then again, (no offense if you&#39;re from the country) but many Americans think Martial Law/Police State rather quickly when it isn&#39;t necessarily the situation they&#39;re actually in.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it is misleading, an exercise would still be going through the same procedures, just without declaring it to be official. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law</a> </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Martial Law describes it as well as a State of Emergency does, and those two things are very different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In what way am I attacking you though? Because I said Martial Law is hyperbole? I didn&#39;t misquote you, I quoted what I thought was important. I already explained that I don&#39;t think using the word &quot;exercise&quot; drastically changes the notion you&#39;re making. If you&#39;d like, I can go back and add exercise to my original post in quotes and not change anything else. Or are you saying that the only way for you to continue is to sink to that level?</p>

<p>I already did acknowledge that I didn&#39;t put exercise in quotes, in an entire post dedicated to just that. As I&#39;ve stated, I don&#39;t think the word exercise means that the sentiment is completely different. </p>

<p>Using the word exercise how you did, it would still mean that it was <em>essentially</em> Martial Law, without the declaration. You are still just agitated that I just didn&#39;t put exercise in quotes, but even if I did, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s accurate (which I&#39;ve stated.) I think it&#39;s much more accurate to use the term State of Emergency than &quot;Full blown Martial Law exercise.&quot;</p>

<p>Because that&#39;s not what it was, it wasn&#39;t a test of doing full blown martial law without actually declaring it, it would only by Martial Law even be the broadest definition, which wouldn&#39;t be a full blown exercise.</p>

<p>If you were truly interested in healthy discussion, you&#39;d be interested in the points I make, not being hung up on me <em>purposely</em> excluding the word exercise, which I&#39;ve already explained as to why I did numerous times. If I put the word exercise in the quotes in my original post, it still wouldn&#39;t change any other part of any of my subsequent posts, and it would be the only change in that post. The word exercise being there doesn&#39;t change it significantly enough to change my point in any way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t expect everyone to agree with me. But in this sub of all places, I at least expect the decency of someone to actually have a discussion with me if they&#39;re going to engage, instead of pick certain parts of my post to reply to and ignore the rest. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a conspiracy theorist, I disagree with infinitely more people than I agree with, but I&#39;m not frustrated by any means, just surprised. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you realize this, but we agree in nearly every way, <strong>except</strong> that I think it was a state of emergency, and not Martial Law. So I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re trying to change my mind about, if not just the definitions of terms. I don&#39;t think what happened is Martial Law, even the &quot;exercise&quot; of it ;)</p>

<p>Like what, agreeing on everything but apparently the definition of the word exercise, and which term of the police shutting down a city should be used? Yikes, it&#39;s like we&#39;re polar opposites!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No because a true martial law would be the military taking over for real law enforcement and suspending all standing laws. That kind of action would automatically draw protest in the US. A real &quot;drill&quot; would need some sort of resisting force to truly test the procedure. This is just law enforcement agencies trying to conduct a large area search/dragnet while keeping bystanders out of the way and safe. As far as I can tell there has been no signs of forced compliance, just people listening to requests because they&#39;d really not like to be blow&#39;d up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a lot of people here are trying to say to people like you, is that it wouldn&#39;t draw protest if protesters were provided some false reason to <em>want</em> martial law.  Such as a desire for safety in the face of a rogue terrorist copkilling muslim communist bomber.</p>

<p>Thats where r/conspiracy comes in.  What if this evil russian sonofabitch is just a tool to create circumstances where government lockdown would be welcomed!?  Rather than having to take people&#39;s freedom by force, people will give it up and thank the government for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno man.  I was in 8th grade on 9/11 and I was all for killing the SHIT outta some muslims.  Patriot act is for our protection and all that jazz.  Luckily I was fairly young so I can shrug off some of the shame by blaming my age, but there are plenty of people who were full adults that shared my sentiments, and still do.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be talking to people at work about this sort of stuff (r/conspiracy stuff) and they&#39;ll down with it to a point, but sooner or later they&#39;ll say &quot;Wait is this all more of your conspiracy stuff?  You gotta warn me when you&#39;re going into this.&quot; (Actual quote from a couple days ago) After that everything I say is just more crazy tinfoil hattery.  </p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t got anything to hide, then why should you worry right?</p>

<p>As far as widespread backlash against the TSA, I haven&#39;t seen much more than facebook activism and angry tweets.  Didn&#39;t do much to Kony and it won&#39;t do much against the TSA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Retaliation is way different than willingly accepting subjugation. Being that you were younger, I&#39;m not sure how much you remember the amount of protest over the invasion of Iraq. Even 9/11 didn&#39;t give the government carte blanche when it came to invading countries and suspending freedom. The resistance to the Patriot Act and the TSA isn&#39;t new at all. These topics were a pretty large rallying point against Bush in 2004.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a pretty heavy topic for sometime within certain groups. Look into Bruce Schneier and the EFF</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing I think you completely overlook is how long people are really willy to be inconvenienced for stuff like this. Americans are self entitled people that aren&#39;t really willing to put up with stuff for long. Look at OWS that was a bunch of people that weren&#39;t even really wronged and they organized and resisted. Americans might play along with &quot;martial law&quot; for a few days (even a week) but eventually they are going to get pissed and start acting out. At that point it comes down to numbers, the vast majority of the armed forces are conservatives and would be more than willing to turn on a tyrannical government if they needed to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe that a &quot;martial law&quot; in America will look anything like sustained tanks in the street.  Also why use the military to police when you can simply militarize the police and people are much more accepting of it.</p>

<p>I think that there is a much more subtle element to what will happen in the US.  The people will have much less money to spend it out on the town.  A large number of people will simply stay home.  Then it is called a &quot;bad economy&quot;.</p>

<p>There also will not necessarily be a permanent lock down everywhere but I think that it will become more and more frequent and people will become used to living in a soft police state for a few weeks at a time.  There will be many visceral distractions while trillions more are stolen.  When the people have been looted you can call it whatever you want to call it.</p>

This whole situation is backwards. according to the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/lcod.htm">Center for Disease Control &amp; Prevention</a>, Americans are mainly dying from Heart disease and Cancer. Now this is in the hundred thousands per year. &#39;Terrorism&#39; has caused a few thousand deaths all together. real Terrorism is Obama&#39;s drone policies that have killed hundreds if not thousands of innocent families. Now declaring a state of emergency in a major city over a very few individuals is a huge collectivist move. Now, keep in mind... due to the massive mainstream media exposure of this incident, laws and regulations will be put in place to further limit individual &#39;freedom&#39;. I&#39;m assuming there will be more Homeland security, body scanners, drones, etc. present at major events and people will slowly be conditioned to accept this. Same exact thing happen at the airports with the TSA after 9/11. They have an excuse to expand operations due to this event. I would say its a major PsyOp.</p>

2) desperate
3) looking for a place to hide

5) Had already killed a cop and exchanged fire and thrown explosives at police.</p>

<p>Not only was the situation extremely dangerous for people in that area, they also had a chance to capture a person they had strong reasons to believe had something to do with the Boston Marathon bombings.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, it isn&#39;t just &#39;one guy&#39;. As far as they knew, he was extremely dangerous, armed, possibly strapped with a explosive vest in a residential area. He could be working with others as well. But maybe he didn&#39;t just get away, they&#39;re him to do this drill you speak of. It&#39;s also highly possible that they knew they were going to bomb and let it happen so they can pass various laws and do that Martial law &#39;drill&#39;. I think the government prefers to LET tragic things happen to take advantage of it, then to stage events. </p>

When I visited in November 2010, there was military personnel at Penn Station carrying assault rifles. Not sure about the Blackhawks, though. Perhaps they didn&#39;t have enough time to land the police chopper, refuel it, then take off and resume the search during a delicate time, so they asked the National Guard (or another branch of the military) for support or something.</p>

<p>What&#39;s insane to me is how people can just accept what the news tells them after we have such access to compelling information regarding coverups, planned operations and Government planned events to hide what&#39;s going on at Capitol Hill. Here&#39;s the laws that were pushed forward and/or passed while the media was given the Boston bombing as a diversion:</p>

<ol>
<li>CISPA passed by House: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22213379">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22213379</a></li>
<li>Congress exempt from insider trading law one week before all financial records were to be disclosed: <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/04/12/congress-votes-to-eliminate-key-requirement-of-insider-trading-law/">http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/04/12/congress-votes-to-eliminate-key-requirement-of-insider-trading-law/</a></li>
</ol>

<p>My thoughts - this was a drill. Not just the bombing itself. Not just the &quot;coincidence&quot; that there was a safety drill: <a href="http://www.infowars.com/confirmed-by-eyewitness-bomb-squad-drill-was-under-way-at-boston-maratho/">http://www.infowars.com/confirmed-by-eyewitness-bomb-squad-drill-was-under-way-at-boston-maratho/</a></p>

<p>Not just the &quot;coincidence&quot; that SpecialOps teams were present and formed immediately after the bombing. Not the &quot;coincidence&quot; that the same cops were in Sandy Hook and at the Boston marathon.</p>

<p>This was a full week long drill. From the safety training that happened days before in the area, through today. THey have more than likely recorded all of the response times, how quickly the public will fall under marshall law in a metropolitan &amp; suburban setting. Think about it, the only reason they probably chose Boston over Chicago is because Chicago is landlocked. This whole week was a military drill at the expense of the public tax dollars and lives to measure casualty rate, response time, public reaction and cooperation.</p>

<p>It seems the only issue they repeatedly have is that the media can&#39;t get their story straight from one minute to the next. Even this could be a tactic to create confusion and fear. It&#39;s much easier to control the masses with fear than with truth. <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/boston-bombing-media-haste-makes-mistakes-182930410--politics.html">http://news.yahoo.com/boston-bombing-media-haste-makes-mistakes-182930410--politics.html</a></p>

<p>Nothing at this level of intelligence is a mistake...or a coincidence. There were apparently bomb sniffing dogs and 500 National Guardsmen on duty at the marathon. These things don&#39;t just happen with that level of security.</p>

<p>Really, you people must have some sort of deep-seated problem with authority of ANY kind if you&#39;d rather go outside with a madman on the loose than stay safe inside simply because you were told not to. No one in their right mind would want to go outside with that going on, but because the police request it while they are trying to find an extremely dangerous individual it means fucking Martial Law is being instituted.</p>

<p>And if anyone disagree with you they are a dumb blind sheep. Right.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_incidents_of_political_violence_in_Washington,_D.C.">1970-1975:  Numerous bombings in D.C.</a> including in the Senate bathroom &amp; the U.S. State Department &amp; allegedly the Pentagon women&#39;s restroom.  Members of the Weather Underground charged with attempted murder.  More bombings continued through 1984.  See link.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_Hanafi_Siege">1977 Hanafi Siege</a>.  A group of alleged U.S. Muslims seize numerous buildings in D.C., take 149 hostages, kill 2 including a cop.  Some were charged with murder.  Others not involved in the murder were charged with kidnapping <em>and released on their own recognizance.</em></p>

<p>&quot;Terrorism&quot; is purely a political tool.  It has nothing to do with any law and has no legal precedent except in democracies gone bad, particularly Germany 1933-1945.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t just about the bombing. They were shooting and throwing explosive devices in a RESIDENTIAL area. I saw pictures of a guys house with bullet holes because of the gun fight. It was likely that he could of started to kill people because he knew he was going to get caught. The reacted correctly. But now did they let it happen for a political agenda? Did they let him get away? </p>
