<p>No, fuck you, I have work and get off my families property.  This is a violation of civilian liberties.  This is to test the population to how they will behave in an official martial law scenario.  </p>

<p>I lived in NY and there were murders every week.  And no you can not bring a tank in my fucking neighborhood and come in my house and inspect it.  If more citizens in bean town has guns to wouldn&#39;t need 900 cops getting overtime to march around boston with wannabe van tanks.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol you serious? It&#39;s not speculation. Police did not &quot;order&quot; people to stay inside, they did not &quot;declare martial law.&quot; Fact. Yet, from the pictures of ghost-town boston all over the internet today, it&#39;s obvious most have stayed inside. The only logical conclusion is that they are staying inside because they WANT to. Sure it is probably heavily influenced by the &quot;advice&quot; given to them by the police, but it&#39;s still a <em>choice</em> they are making. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you have drugs in your car and don&#39;t let cops search, they will call in a dog to sniff. Unless you are a skilled smuggler, the dog will catch a sent and they will have probable cause anyways. </p>

<p>You know that there have been plenty of people who have stood their grounds in these situations, right? They got wrongfully pulled over for whatever bullshit reason and refused a search because they are innocent. You know what happens in these cases? The cops get their dogs to come out, the dogs don&#39;t pick up a scent, and after wasting two hours of that person&#39;s life, they let him go because they have to.</p>

<p>So most people who do get into this situation make a CHOICE to let the cops search their car. Not for fear of repercussions, but rather because they don&#39;t want to wait an hour or two for the next available dog to show up. Sure, they probably don&#39;t WANT to let them search their car, but it&#39;s still a choice they are making. </p>

<p>Your complaint here is extremely pedantic. My original statement wasn&#39;t so much that they <em>desire</em> to stay inside today, but rather that they are <em>making a choice</em> to stay inside, rather than being forced to with the threat of certain consequences. I thought that was, and it should have been, obvious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the drugs thing was just the first thing to pop into my head.  But you&#39;re aware that its not unheard of, or even uncommon, for dogs to &quot;smell drugs&quot; where drugs are not present, right?</p>

<p>My point was, that even though police &quot;ask&quot; you to do something, there will be consequences if you deny their &quot;requests.&quot;  </p>

<p>I guess having heavily armed paramilitary forces in your doorway has no influence on your &quot;choice&quot; to stay inside then?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it has an influence, but we&#39;re talking about the theoretical question of whether or not these people <em>made a choice</em> to stay inside, or were <em>forced against their will</em> to stay inside. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m fine with the police asking/advising people to stay inside.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not fine with the massive display of military force, or the intrusion into private homes in the name of &quot;safety.&quot;</p>

<p>Also not cool with the suggestion that people&#39;s decisions to stay inside is unrelated to the armored vehicles in their streets and armed police forces in their neighborhoods. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay well, the massive display of military force in this situation is pretty warranted. There&#39;s a terrorist on the loose who&#39;s only apparent motivation is to harm other people with explosives.</p>

<p>By your logic, since there are many police and tanks outside, any instance of them &quot;asking&quot; you to do something is really just intimidation tactics and omfg martial law. So no, you actually are NOT &quot;fine&quot; with the police asking/advising people to stay inside. By your logic, you are only &quot;fine&quot; with them asking people to stay inside if there is not a corresponding massive display of military force. </p>

<p>So what you seem to want here is for the police to ask people to stay inside, but to not actually have any officers or vehicles out on the streets, because otherwise they are not really asking they are ordering/intimidating you to stay inside. Do you not see the catch-22 here?</p>

<p>Well, sorry to burst your bubble, but it&#39;s impossible for them to do their job in boston right now - catch this guy and protect innocent people from harm - without a lot of officers and vehicles on the street. If simply their presence is going to, in your mind, change &quot;asking&quot; into &quot;ordering,&quot; then I truly cannot fathom what you think should be happening right now. It sounds to me like what you would like to see is no police presence at all, and that is really hilariously stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right man.  This is the only possible solution.</p>

<p>Flooding the streets with armored vehicles and invading peoples homes is the <em>ONLY</em> way to stop the terrorists.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think house to house searching is the best solution, nor do I think it will accomplish anything.  How you can think thats a good idea is beyond me.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think its a good idea in any situation to lose our shit and let the government do whatever it wants for any reason.  It hasn&#39;t helped anything in the past.  It wont help anything now.  I don&#39;t know about you, but if armored men were knocking on my door asking to search my shit, I wouldn&#39;t feel safer.</p>

<p>And yeah.  I am only fine with a police request if it comes without a corresponding display of military force, because I&#39;m not okay with police displays of military force.  I&#39;m not sure if that was supposed to be some sort of sarcastic jab at me, but its dead on. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a sarcastic jab, I just couldn&#39;t comprehend how you could honestly hold that view because I didn&#39;t think you were trolling, I thought you actually believed this.</p>

<p>I&#39;m fine with the police asking/advising people to stay inside.</p>

<p>But only if there are no cops around.</p>

<p>If there are any cops and vehicles around, then it is impossible for cops to &quot;ask&quot; anything, in this case they are  actually &quot;ordering&quot; you via intimidation.</p>

<p>I never said, and I&#39;m not of the opinion, that any police presence is a display of military force.  The fact that you have to reduce the argument to the extremes of complete absence of police vs total military lockdown shows how unable you are to actually defend your stance.</p>

<p>But what can you expect on a day when r/conspiracy suddenly makes a 180degree ideological shift overnight.  Definitely not shills though.  Everybody just suddenly saw the light and no longer believes in false flags or government setups.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only people who are ever going to see this deep are you and I, we both know that you didn&#39;t say those second two things as I quoted them. I wasn&#39;t trying to hide that. I was paraphrasing, angrily.</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s really hard to understand you&#39;re actual stance. What exact display of force, between absolutely 0 and what we are actually seeing, would be the threshold here? At which point does the police&#39;s &quot;asking&quot; turn into &quot;forcing.&quot; </p>

<p>To me, it is a question of whether or not people actually face consequences for stepping outside, or refusing a search, in this whole ordeal. You guys are saying yes absolutely, but we have no real evidence. Somewhere here there&#39;s a twitter chick who makes it seem like she was asked <em>if</em> she wanted her home searched. I just don&#39;t trust any sources and I think it&#39;s terrible to jump to the conclusion that this is basically martial law and people are being forced to submit to searches (invaded, as you&#39;ve said.) The vast majority of unnofficial sources I am seeing today lead me to believe that people are not being forced to do anything or threatened here. I really think that somebody would get this kind of thing on video and especially if it was happening widespread and in the open, we&#39;d be seeing tons and tons of hard evidence of it. When I see the evidence I will agree with you.</p>

<p>About this subreddit changing overnight I cannot say, I am new here. But look at my posts (if you want), I am a member of <a href="/r/libertarian">/r/libertarian</a> and that&#39;s about the extent of political discussion on reddit so far. I&#39;ll try to take it as a compliment you implying I&#39;m a shill, but yeah... I fucking hate our government and the untouchable corporate/banking elite that own them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rofl, I&#39;ve already given more info than you have elsewhere in this thread, but I&#39;ll copy it for you.</p>

<p>My main source giving me the impression that they are not ordering/forcing people to stay inside is the <a href="https://twitter.com/Boston_Police">BPD Twitter Feed</a>. The announcements there clearly indicate they are <em>advising</em> people to stay inside and are asking for the community&#39;s <em>consent</em> with searches. </p>

<p>Your main source is &quot;I saw it on the news.&quot;</p>

<p>Listen I&#39;ll put it pretty simply. If there were police caught on camera <em>forcing</em> or <em>ordering</em> people into their homes, the clip would already be on youtube and trending all over social media. It&#39;s not. </p>

<p>You give me a youtube clip of such a thing and I will admit that I am completely wrong and that you were right all along. I am patient; I will be following this for quite some time. If it exists, that clip <strong>will</strong> find its way to me.</p>

<p>edit - as for &quot;everybody is cooperating&quot; you can&#39;t be complaining about the literal interpretation of &quot;everybody&quot;, right? <a href="http://imgur.com/a/cA7Y1">This popular post</a> on <a href="/r/pics">/r/pics</a> shows boston looks empty today, it&#39;s pretty clear that almost everybody is staying inside. Are you really complaining that I left out the world &quot;almost&quot; there? No reasonable person would think I meant 100% everybody. </p>

<p>Why has no other news outlet reported it then?  Is John King getting some &quot;exclusive news&quot; again?  An order like that would go out over the scanners, why has not a single individual in any of the Boston threads mentioned this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is that you and the OP of the &quot;theory&quot; have picked something which is completely unverifiable (since we can&#39;t go back on the live stream), lacks any other sources confirming said &quot;news&quot; (which I would bet there would be many), and from an organization that, throughout this whole ordeal, has been shown repeatedly to be the last place for quality information.  </p>

<p>Why is no one reporting this in the one of many threads relating to the incident?  The instructions to &quot;threaten&quot; people would go over the scanners, why has no one picked that detail up?  It doesn&#39;t appear on the CNNLive twitter feed, nor in any CNN articles... wouldn&#39;t news like that be worthy of an article (if not a headline) and a tweet?</p>

<p>So yeah, gtfo please, eye guy. Unless you give me a youtube link to this &quot;threatening&quot; thing on CNN you saw. If police where on camera threatning innocent people just for being outside and not wanting to stay inside, it would be on youtube right now and already trending. It&#39;s not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>They &quot;ordered&quot; businesses to close, but only &quot;told&quot; residents to stay inside. The author of this article is paraphrasing, and his use of the world &quot;told&quot; is ambiguous. He used the word &quot;ordered&quot; for businesses, but &quot;told&quot; for residents. I&#39;m assuming here it is totally acceptable in this situation to ask business to stay closed, but I am no lawyer that is admittedly an assumption.</p>

<p>Anyways... if they were both &quot;orders&quot;, why didn&#39;t he use &quot;ordered&quot; in both parts of this sentence? This article is easily consistent with the official story right now which is that the BPD <em>asked</em> people to stay inside.</p>

<p>I could definitely be wrong, I hope not, but sure, I could be wrong here. Probably not going to know for sure either way until videos surface. If there really was a live incident that you saw on CNN showing officers <em>threatening</em> innocent civilians just for being outside, then it <strong>will</strong> end up on youtube and I&#39;ll see it. Until then I am waiting for more information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pathetic, really!? Wow, dude. You just called hundreds of thousands of people pathetic for being afraid of explosions and gunfights going on. Nice.</p>

<p>Fear is a natural instinct that (almost) all humans have to deal with. It is <em>instinctual</em> to be afraid in situations like this. One can argue that, objectively and with statistics in mind, you&#39;re probably technically safer driving to work in boston today than usual simply because nobody else is driving - less chance of a fatal car crash. Using this logic one can argue it is <em>irational</em> to be afraid in situations like this, but it is simply <em>instinctual.</em> To call people pathetic for that is just abhorrent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually agree with you. We should try to not be afraid in situations like these. Living in fear of terrorism is irrational when you look at the numbers objectively, and is exactly what &quot;they&quot; wanted with 9/11 and other attacks.</p>

<p>What I take issue with here is some douchebag calling people who have such fears &quot;pathetic.&quot; We&#39;re talking about normal people here, being afraid because an explosion went off in their city. It is extremely mean to call such people &quot;pathetic&quot; for not being able to override their instincts with logical analysis. Read a few articles about overcoming our animalistic instincts, like fear, it&#39;s actually pretty hard. If it comes to you naturally and you can honestly say you wouldn&#39;t be afraid, at all, if you were in boston right now, then you are the gifted minority.</p>

<p>If that is our strength then they will not meet us on that battlefield.  I think that the government will go with sustained acts of terror.</p>

<p>Also lets say that bombs are going off once in a while.  Do you think that people will want to assemble?  Do you believe that enough people would blame the government?  I believe that the lines will be very blurred and that the majority of people will walk right into massive control because they won&#39;t understand the basic nature of what it means.

The people will do 99.9% of the work for the police state by staying home much more and then the stranglers on the streets will be easier to mess with.  A pushy police force on the streets  is a small part of martial law.  The larger by a few magnitudes much more important part is people huddling in their homes in fear of open spaces.  That part can be achieved incredibly easily because of the limitations of the people.  Then people will see the police and they will project onto the police/soldiers everything negative about the situation.  Then bombs and open shootings will occur as needed until the people begin to slowly forget about their previous way of life.  The memory of it will gently slip away as if it was simply a previously lower gas price.  This will be occurring in stages as the economy breaks down and people will simply not have enough money to be spending it at bars and sandwhich shops.  I&#39;ve lived in a city in Northern California that actually had a police lock down for 2-3 years and they transformed the city to a dull husk of what it used to be.  They police deliberately transformed the city through intimidation and they changed it.  Then they reduced the police force back to normal and it stuck.  Also I&#39;ve lived in Ukraine where people stay inside a fair amount and they talk a lot and drink tea and alcohol at home to save money.  In this martial law that is coming it will be not that easy to put a hard finger on it.  You will still be able to get around fairly easily but there will be many more random stops like DUI check points and basic car searches.  People will internalize this hassle and with their lack of money they will choose to do the easy thing and to stay home.  This government is not likely to call a spade a spade.  If we have problems with the military policing then they will militarize the police, etc on and on.  Americans are brimming over with illusion and so a hard police state that snipes people after curfew is completely out of the question and is also not at all useful in our case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Surprisingly, I think you and I might actually agree on a lot of things if we were to have an extended discussion. I worry about what this country is forming into as well, and you&#39;ve just outlined some of my very real concerns. Perhaps they will find a way to get where they want without pushing Americans past the tipping point to the point where we actually, truly, fight back. That&#39;s definitely a possibility that concerns me as well. </p>

<p>I have a few good friends in the U.S. military. I&#39;ve talked with all of them about this issue, and have asked them if they are worried about america turning into a truly oppresive, tyrannical police-state. Some are, some aren&#39;t. But what they have ALL told me is that if the really scary stuff were to start happening, like let&#39;s just say throwing libertarians or any other &quot;political dissenters&quot; into FEMA concentration camps, to quote the very extreme, is that they wouldn&#39;t be able to get the soldiers to do it. The military itself would faction and (hopefully) the majority would overthrow whoever tried to do such a thing. Each of these men tells me that they work for me, and other citizens, and to uphold the consistitution, not blindly for Obama. And that if the current administration started asking them to do large-scale, truly tyrannical shit, the soldiers wouldn&#39;t carry it out.</p>

<p>I could go on for too long here and shouldn&#39;t at this time. Let me just finish by saying again I think you and I might actually agree on a lot, I just strongly disagree with you calling these people &quot;pathetic&quot; for being afraid. It&#39;s really mean. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that the system is advanced enough to not do the sorts of things that we are preparing to fight against.  My main point in all of this is the steps to actually arrive at a police state can be very subtle.  At this point I do trust the military soldiers much more than I do the beat cops.  So I don&#39;t think that it is coming that way.  Personally I think that the average America is so spineless that nothing even close to hard force is necessary to get them in line.  I&#39;m not a big believer that FEMA camps will be used anything like it is feared, although they do exist.  They exist as a contigency option and I think that illusion, fear, intimidation and television are much more up the governments main focus areas.  I think that the government is in touch with the population enough to know just about how many people they could slurp up to put in a few camps without there being much revolt on the matter.</p>

<p>If you read <em>The Shock Doctrine</em> you&#39;ll see how much more efficient and delicate the techniques became for transforming a society.  In the beginning they would kill and torture a whole bunch of people.  Several countries later they would just remove and isolate some very small numbers of people and just like in 1984 they knew better than to make martyrs out of them.  After the societal transformation had occurred say over 1-2 years they would release the people from confinement.  Then the people would be so incredibly weary from massive disruption that they would cement the new order.  Theese sciences are much more advanced than what people in America can handle.  Americans do not understand the sublety of the techniques and they are very prone to fleeting rationilizations and so I think that there is a better than not chance that the society will be transformed.  Meanwhile some people will have piles of ammunition and I think that they will be mostly missing some relevant strategy even though they know that its all fucked up and totally wrong.</p>

<p>National post article written with someone from AP... ok, maybe they aren&#39;t IN Boston, but that&#39;s 1/3 sources. If you know how to use Google, you&#39;ll see there are MANY news sources. I&#39;m sure many of them are IN Boston, as well.  </p>

<p>Perception is reality. If you come around a corner to a LEO beating a civvie, he&#39;s out of control, violating his authority.  </p>

<p>Now, what if I was already around that corner, and saw that civvie take a run at the officer, who quickly overpowered and subdued him?  </p>

<p>Two very different &quot;truths,&quot; wouldn&#39;t you say? Truth is a very easily bent concept. Many years ago the &quot;truth&quot; was that the earth was flat.</p>

<p>Look, yes, the reaction might be a bit much, but honestly, this is really one of those &quot;rather safe than sorry&quot; situations. These guys are <em>obviously</em> ready to not only shoot but <em>blow up</em> people who get in their way.</p>

<p>Also, like others have stated, there is no martial law, people are not being forced to stay inside, and honestly, as much as it would be in my right to deny police to search my home, how goddamn stupid would I be to do that, in a situation like this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree that the door to door stuff is ridiculous (if true, there&#39;s varying reports), as well as the seemingly true martial law, I think it&#39;s more on the people who don&#39;t want to go out.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Because they are afraid.  This isn&#39;t a guy who just has a gun and is running around.  For all they know, they could walk by a bomb he set and get killed when they never even saw him.  The fear thing is interesting though, since the media is definitely hyping it, I think it&#39;d be more beneficial to have people on high alert and out, where they could help look for the guy (debatable since he&#39;s armed and has already killed the security guard at MIT).</p></li>
<li><p>With the heightened tensions, there are some people who are very pissed off at the situation.  So the cops are on edge about everyone who is remotely suspicious.  The last thing an innocent person wants to do is get into a situation where the FBI/SWAT/BPD surrounds them guns drawn (think back to the Dorner shootings).  It could be something as simple as carrying a briefcase and failing to follow an order to submit to a search, dressing the wrong way, or driving down the wrong street.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As far the conditioning and test about how people react, I&#39;m with you on that one.  It&#39;s like the TSA and people&#39;s willingness to listen to and submit to orders fromm people with &quot;authority.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Europe here. I&#39;m quite scared watching these pictures. It doesn&#39;t make sense, it doesn&#39;t seem appropriate, it doesn&#39;t seem justified.</p>

<p>What frightens me the most is how do you actually distinguish the difference between what is happening here and a legit &quot;martial law&quot;. I&#39;d like to give some thoughts:</p>

<p>First off martial law seems to be when a city is in ruins and the government cannot control it anymore the military gets called in. However as our times have advanced we have government law enforcement that has special riot teams or otherwise teams that are equipped pretty much like a military team would be. So for the sake of this discussion I&#39;m not making the difference between technically part of the military branch or the law enforcement branch, I&#39;m putting them in the same group and that&#39;s how I will be using the term &quot;martial law&quot; in the upcoming segment.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say this is not martial law. People aren&#39;t actively being combatted. However the presence of the miltary equipped units is there. A difference here is that rather than martial law being a response to a city in complete chaos (riots, fires, violent citizen mobs and so on) it is used pro-actively. The city is not in complete chaos in the sense discribed above, yet they still took to the streets. To me this is point one of why I think it&#39;s an incredibly wierd and seemingly illigitimate move.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say this is martial law. People are actively being combatted. Note here that this is only applies when people are being active and not passive. For example, people take to the streets and blow up cars and stores, they are gonna get combatted by the martial law teams. Another example, people take to the streets to walk their dog, they are gonna get combatted by martial law teams. The point I&#39;m making here is that unless people take a stance, you cannot actually determine if it is &quot;martial law&quot;. With nobody doing anything to provoke a response, a response will be absent, and it&#39;s that response that is critical to determing what is actually going on.</p>

<p>My final point is one of fear. At what point do we seperate intimidation from pre-mediation. Depending on the context, If I pull a gun on you do I actually want to shoot you? If I show you I have a gun do I actually want to pull it on you? The mere presence of certain elements like aggression or hostility don&#39;t need to evoked for them to take effect. I think this is an interesting point with many perspectives. The one I would take is that this is similar to showing you I have a gun. Let&#39;s say we are having a drink and get into an argument over who can use the toilet first. If in that argument I show you I have a gun will that alter the way you act? Will you be more inclinded to let me use the toilet first, or maybe you don&#39;t even want to use the toilet anymore?
If I were to pull of that move (show of force) it would be very manipulative. In the same way I think taking to the streets with such military presence is also manipulative. It does affect a number of people&#39;s actions, dare I say the majority. Even if you are suddenly scared to go out not because of their presence but because of what them being there represent, it&#39;s all the same. It can be calculated and it&#39;s manipulative.</p>

<p>If you actually read all this, thanks for your time hope you found it somewhat interesting. :)</p>

<p>Just my way of getting some thoughts out of my head so I can focus on other things again.</p>

There&#39;s an EXTREMELY dangerous individual loose and in order to do their jobs and keep more people from getting killed, police need to keep them indoors until it&#39;s over. Unfortunately, most people are fucking idiots and asking isn&#39;t sufficient to keep their dumb asses safe so they have to be TOLD. Who gives a shit? As long as they&#39;re safe. If the police keep this up after he&#39;s caught or killed I&#39;ll be the first to say fuck that, but it&#39;s good policy right now and it&#39;s keeping people safe so r/conspiracy needs to chill the fuck out</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005686">On the night of February 27-28, 1933, a mentally disabled Dutch citizen set fire to the German parliament building (the Reichstag). Hitler and his propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, presented the incident as the prelude to an armed Communist uprising and persuaded the aging President Paul von Hindenburg to establish what became a permanent state of emergency. This decree, known as the Reichstag Fire Decree, suspended the provisions of the German constitution that protected basic individual rights, including freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and freedom of assembly. <strong>The decree also permitted increased state and police intervention into private life, allowing officials to censor mail, listen in on phone conversations, and search private homes without a warrant or need to show reasonable cause. Under the state of emergency established by the decree, the Nazi regime could arrest and detain people without cause and without limits on the length of incarceration.</strong></a></p>

<p>Just a friendly reminder to question everything and not let history repeat itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that the whole resonance of the attack and the fact these guys had managed to evade detention until last night means they have the will and preparation that makes them quite dangerous. I can see that, while quite overwhelming, this police and military response is obvious in order to show the population they are doing something.</p>

<p>In that light, this sweep is justified. The guy (let&#39;s continue entertaining the theory these were the right guys) has proven they don&#39;t give a shit over killing innocents. So, yes, if there are tanks on my street to catch him, well, so be it. </p>

<p>BUT if later this citywide sweep comes up to have inflicted illegal searches and detentions for unrelated causes, citizens get detained for trivial reasons and treated as suspects if they failed to comply instantly to whatever order they were issued by authorities, and this kind of occupation becomes routine in every event and we are told to get used to checkpoints and warrantless searches and detainment, now THAT is worrying.</p>

<p>Nah, it&#39;s much more likely that these 2 guys were at the marathon finish line, dropped backpacks just before the blasts and at the exact site of the blasts, then murdered a police officer and led police on a chase while discharging the exact same type of bombs that were used at the marathon, but it&#39;s all just a misunderstanding.  </p>
