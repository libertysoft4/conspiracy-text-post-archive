<p>Three things to look at.</p>

<p>When they announced they arrested someone who was not related to the boston bombing and was innocent after a strip search and released him this was the photo they showed. This isnt a photoshop and I saw with my own eyes on CNN.</p>

<p><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BIMN23PCMAEeLT4.jpg:large">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BIMN23PCMAEeLT4.jpg:large</a></p>

<p>So now Im like okay thats fine.</p>

<p>BUT who is this guy walkign with black hair and naked? Looks like the brother and is pretty built. REMEMBER THE GUY WALKING DOES NOT HAVE BLONDE HAIR.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?client=mv-google&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US&amp;v=u6Te9mMuhag&amp;nomobile=1">http://www.youtube.com/watch?client=mv-google&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US&amp;v=u6Te9mMuhag&amp;nomobile=1</a></p>

<p>So now with some closeup and comparisons..</p>

<p>Can someone please prove me wrong. I really do want to be proved wrong but for now IM very shocked.</p>

<p>Anyways, why doesn&#39;t anybody from the media want to interview the guy to ask him anything about what happened to him? How he was stripped naked in the middle of the street and put into a police car naked because he was potentially the bomber.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this. I don&#39;t know about you, but if my naked body was just plastered on CNN, I&#39;d be mortified. I wouldn&#39;t want anyone to know it was me. Also, if you look closely, just before the guy is put in the car you get a good glimpse at the side of his face, and the guy&#39;s nose is nowhere near as big as the dead suspect. Also, he didn&#39;t have nearly as much chest hair. I do think something is up though, something does seem off about all of this. </p>

<p>If you look at the pics again, the crsft guys appear to not be interacting with any of the other law enforcement folks. They are seen alone and separate then running and grouping together near their vehicle but seem to have no connectii n to others.</p>

<p>Were they supposed to be private security to the sandyhook families? If so why were they not seen protecting any of their charges?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I find confusing, and correct me if I&#39;m wrong, is why did the younger brother (tamerlan) try to kill himself by shooting himself in the neck? I&#39;m not sure if it was a bullet wound or a knife inflicted wound but either way, if he is capable of building a bomb out of scratch a home then he is fully capable of committing suicide. If it was a bullet wound, then that just doesn&#39;t make sense. If it was a knife sound, it&#39;s extremely easy to commit suicide by slicing the carotid artery and you will bleed out fairly quickly because of the high arterial pressure. </p>

<p>Again please don&#39;t downvote me just because you disagree with me. I&#39;m just looking for an answer. </p>

<p>And also there&#39;s a strong possibility he won&#39;t be able to speak? So two guys are responsible for this attack, one&#39;s dead, the other&#39;s captured and now a mute. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>TMI but I&#39;m gay and have seen my fair share of naked dudes on the internet... Bad quality video often makes body hair appear &quot;not there&quot; when actually closer/clearer video would reveal it actually is.</p>

<p>I have a thing for body hair, specifically chest... so I&#39;m the closest thing to an expert you&#39;ll find on this.</p>

<p>I also think it&#39;s Tamerlan because the definition of his torso is pretty much identical. (Again, I probably spend more time looking at dudes&#39; chests than you do.)</p>

<p>Even the autopsy photo makes his chest hair look different to the shirtless boxing photo. So there&#39;s all sorts of weirdness when angles/lighting comes into the mix.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The police chief, Edward Deveau, describes how cops nearly apprehended the older suspect, and were placing handcuffs on him in the middle of the street Thursday night, when the younger suspect came at officers in a carjacked SUV. The cops were able &quot;to dive out of the way,&quot; and the younger suspect then continued to drive directly over his brother and dragging him through the street. That&#39;s how the older suspect died, according to the police chief.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Going by that account, the picture of the guy standing there naked, with his hands behind his back - could very well be Tamerlan a short while before his brother tried to run them all down.</p>

<p>The picture of brown/blonde haired guy, with the black hoodie, laying face down on the ground, was the bystander who was checked and released.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, there are thousands of people combing through every tiny detail of this who want to... find unexplained things, find discrepancies, holes, anything and honestly they will find some genuinely weird things and some crazy coincidences, there is no doubt.</p>

<p>Take a look at Alex Jones, I mean he does it for a living. The key thing to note is he never finds the conspiracy though. He never produces something that is strong enough to take to court, never a solid list of suspects.. always tantalisingly out of reach until the next incident distracts him. Martial law always juuust around the corner (ever since he&#39;s been on air).</p>

<p>It&#39;s identical in every situation, Aurora, the Sikh shooting, Sandy Hook, and so on.</p>

<p>This will be down-voted to all hell, but it&#39;s just a classic and deep-held suspicion of authority that fuels it. Boston Marathon no different. Next similar incident will be the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shocking resemblance. </p>

<p>Some observations I make from this and just some exploring of possibilities in making comparisons:</p>

<p>The bloody photo is from the morgue of the alleged suspect 1? So that should be one of the brothers yes? In particular the kickboxing brother.</p>

<p>If you look at the ear, the inside of the ear doesn&#39;t seem the same as the kickboxing guy picture. The living person has much more depth to his ear, the outer ring protrudes more. The inside is far deeper and well defined than the &quot;dead&quot; person. The dead person&#39;s earlobe seems to be much longer. The most compelling here is that the living person seems to have a very defined triangle shape to his inner ear. Whereas the morgue guy has a clear &quot;cut&quot; in one of the legs of what the triangle would be.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what happens to an ear if blood stops flowing, or how he was hit and if any of that explains what I feel are differences in ear. But that seems very possible that something has modified his ear to look different. Not to mention the angles and lighting aren&#39;t exactly the same.</p>

<p>Comparing noses, if you look at the picture with the boxing gloves you can see his nose is huge. Much bigger than in the other pictures. On the contrary the picture that is taken from his face from his left side shows a much smaller nose than the other pictures. Maybe it is because of intensive sporting that the blood flows better and these organs grow bigger or smaller?</p>

<p>As for the chest hair. This is a feature that is very easy to manipulate. Just because he has chest hair on the picture with the gloves doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t shave his chest hair. He could have shaved his chest hair. </p>

<p>The picture of him walking is very bad and doesn&#39;t give a lot of detail. So they look very much alike, their total physique seems to match but there is like no detail in it so it&#39;s a bit worthless unless we get a better picture of the naked man. </p>

<p>If you have a better picture you could potentially also see if the chest hair was recently shaved. Even though that doesn&#39;t say much. What I&#39;m interested in is the shape of his head. The naked guy has a bit more round head than we see in the other pictures. Is it because the picture isn&#39;t clear or because he is clenching his jaws in that picture? I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting though. If you are able to find even one piece of &quot;physical&quot; evidence that pretty much rules out the possibility that it&#39;s the same person or confirms it, that would be huge. Like if the naked man&#39;s nipples were at a totally different place you would have strong evidence that they are not the same person. Similar for the morgue guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.</p>

<p>Yeah the angle/lighting/pic quality can change the way something looks pretty dramatically, but there appears to be no real resemblance between the two outside of being ears.</p>

<p>Edit: Upon further inspection, if you look at the pictures from this <a href="http://i.imgur.com/1WgWMQS.jpg">image</a> they look a lot more like each other since the details are not lost in the extreme close up. Still not convinced they are the same, but there are some resemblances. The &#39;outer ring&#39; and the bottom part of the ear looks similar, but the inside looks different (could be swelling?)</p>

<p>Really need a better angle of him healthy/alive to say one way or the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are my opinions: I took a look at all those photos, and I&#39;m convinced, the resemblances are too identical to be illogically not the same person. I even looked at the photo of the ear, the only reason why I can see it looks slightly different is because of the angle of the photos, and the angles the head&#39;s were positioned in the photos but if you try to look at them as if side to side at the same angle, they&#39;re the same ear. There&#39;s so much fucked up about this particular attack it&#39;s not even funny. Remember &quot;Dawn&quot; the principal that allegedly was murdered trying to protect children? Guess who was running in that 26th mile dedicated to sandy hook, like 9/11 the event took place during a simulation &quot;drill&quot; of the same type of attack same as during 9/11 they reportedly were simulating a hijacking of the same statue. I think it&#39;s fairly obvious this was an inside job, it&#39;s more obvious than 9/11 was. People who don&#39;t think so have no excuse and seem to forget that human beings lie, ironically they have no problem classifying everyone on the Internet as liar. But as soon as something is said on TV without mentioning otherwise it&#39;s assumed as a fact. It all truly began on April 15th. Where battleground martial law was simulated, that was the only real drill here. </p>

<p>Its been reported somewhere that he was later released. In all honesty he does look similar in physical stature to the pictures of Tamerlan Tsarnaev during his boxing interview, however he does not fit the subjects physical build profile of the alleged morgue photo released of suspect #1.</p>

This is probably him. </p>

<p>Edit: can&#39;t link from my phone but live update posts 1&amp;2 mentions naked guy no longer being a suspect. So he was released. Also, can&#39;t seem to find what I remember reading about the guy with no id. It may have been a comment in one of those posts. I&#39;m too tired to search at the moment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we could get an alive photo of him showing his profile we could check the ear. It looks to me like different ears, the ear lobes look similar, but the flesh above it (leading to ear canal) looks to be a different shape. Can someone professional tell us if ears have the capacity to look different after death? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow this is an amazing catch, the guy laying on the ground has a very different hairline than the guy getting into the police car. The guy getting into the police car, if you horizontally line the eyebrow to the point that comes down to a corner shape before the sideburns, it is a definite match. The guy on the ground doesn&#39;t even have that squared off shape, it curves instead. Also the closest part to the eyebrow to the hairline of blonde guy is not as close as the guy who is getting into the police car.</p>
