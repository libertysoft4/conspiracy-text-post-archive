        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We will never know for sure what really happened in Boston, whether the suspect brothers were framed, if the Craft was there as handlers, or even if the guy in the wheelchair was an amputee.  </p>

<p>It no longer matters.</p>

<p>What we can take away from Boston is that the public no longer trusts the government in anyway, shape or form. </p>

<p>The mere fact that people are skeptical of the official story and looking evidence that the FBI lied tells me that the jig is up.</p>

<p>I am not talking about the usual mistrust that the public feels when they say our elected leaders do not have our best interests at heart, but embracing the idea that the government would actually kill its own citizens to further a political agenda. Many people now readily accept this as fact. </p>

<p>This is why people are concerned about drones. It is not the invasion of privacy as much as it is the grim realization that the government would use these killing machines to hunt civilians.  And it goes beyond just being fearful that this is a possibility, but that it is the actual <em>INTENT</em> of the government to do this. The public no longer deals in possibilities, but instead looks at worse case scenarios as probabilities.</p>

<p>We now no longer just doubt what they are telling us.  <strong>We expect them to lie.</strong></p>

<p>And with Boston, we saw plenty of people looking for validation of this one sad fact. People weren&#39;t looking for “how this could happen” but instead they were searching for problems with the official story -- an expectation that it was there. Like Sandy Hook, there was plenty to focus on.</p>

<p>The public is nothing more than a vast sea of potential opinion to influence and manipulate.  They do not care about the individuals, but the whole, and it is all about control. And they have lost it.</p>

<p>A false flag not only has become a distinct possibility in many people&#39;s minds, but a likely probability. In fact, I would say it is more than just a small minority who believe this, or at least suspect it.</p>

<p>More importantly, if you read comments on forums across the Internet, even the shills are no longer offering the excuse that “the government could never find that many people to orchestrate and carry out such an evil deed.” Remember when they used to give us the excuse that no group could carry out such a conspiracy because someone, somewhere would talk?  When was the last time you heard that?</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t even matter if everything is on the up-and-up and there is no insidious plan to thwart the Constitution. It doesn&#39;t matter if DHS really bought 2 billion rounds of ammo as a hedge against inflation. It doesn&#39;t matter if every single cop, in every single law enforcement agency is wearing a white hat and bringing us milk and kittens to our front door. Heck, maybe mainstream news organizations really think they are doing journalism. </p>

<p>Right or wrong, truth or lies, no one believes them any more.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t trust our government and our law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>Even if they showed us pictures of this kid holding a bowling ball with a lit fuse, most of us would be immediately looking for how it was Photoshopped.</p>

<p>The tide has turned.  The truth is that whatever they do – even if they told the truth – people will no longer believe them.  They have lost the trust of the public and this time, it&#39;s not coming back. </p>

<p>And I think you are on to something. We may not ever know the truth, but we can watch the consequences of the events. The key here is to see what happens next. Who will use this tragedy, in what form, and to what purpose to profit. </p>

<p>We are already aware of CISPA and the gun legislation. But I am seeing threads about immigration and gun/black powder. </p>

<p>I predict that this kid dies from his wounds sustained in the &quot;battle&quot;. Then I predict some Herculean bills/laws being proposed. These will be fear based, just like the Patriot Act. </p>

<p>People who protest them will be labeled as un-American and their voices will be drown out by people, groups and institutions on the payroll.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a momentum -- sheer inertia -- that carries this agenda forward.  I think even the realization that it stinks to high heaven will not make them alter or change the ultimate goal.  They can&#39;t.</p>

<p>I also believe the backlash will be vicious. I believe that once the public breaks out the pitchforks and torches they are going to be gunning for anyone they view as &quot;helping the enemy.&quot;  Anyone on the payroll will be targeted for retribution.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like we&#39;re all hurtling toward an endgame and no one can stop the crazy train.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, but I don&#39;t share your optimism. There are too many people who are justifying the actions of the police, too many people still not questioning and so many who accept that the suspects shouldn&#39;t have rights, even though they are citizens. Twitter is just a cesspool of America Ra-Ra-Ra right now.</p>

<p>I think there are more people questioning, but I don&#39;t think it will be enough. If anything, this action may have been intentionally this obvious, if only to be able to bring out more potential free-thinkers and sceptics, for when the time comes to lock them up.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know OP. I was around some relatives today and from what they said I would have to strongly disagree. All of my brother in laws family were highly supportive of the official story, even though they couldn&#39;t tell you the official story if they tried. They were saying things like &quot;we know they(official suspects #1 and #2) were obviously guilty and should have been killed on the spot. I believe the exact quote was &quot;they&#39;re obviously guilty, i don&#39;t know why the police didn&#39;t just kill them right then and there. they deserve it.&quot; They also thought that marshal law was not only ok, but a necessary thing given the situation. One of them said &quot;I don&#39;t want to know what they(the government) do, I just want them to protect me, I don&#39;t care how they do it.&quot; The whole time I was around these people I was reminded of how the battle is very far from won. They were ALL in support of MARSHAL LAW and suspension of habeas corpus. So no, not everyone is awake to the lies. If i had to guess its closer to 60/40...and that 40 is mostly southerners with fucktons of guns. 
P.S. I live in the south and these aren&#39;t the only people I know who think this way, not even close. </p>

<p>But then, I live in northern RI and most of my coworkers are from MA (where I work). People are really taking the attack seriously around here and not questioning it at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, pretty much everyone at my place of work is doubting the official story.  The big questions is &quot;Why?&quot;  and if the why doesn&#39;t make sense, then the story is clearly bogus.  If this WAS a False Flag, I think they miscalculated using Chechnyans with poor ties to Islam as a scapegoat. That coupled with the obvious paramilitary presence in the area has most people waiting to see what piece of legislation they are going to try and ram through. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not clearly a False Flag event, but at the same time not enough makes any sort of sense for it to be genuine.  You have clear evidence of organizations on the ground (Multiple people in uniforms who are not officially there; Bomb Squads running simulations/training exercises; large military presence evidenced by their appearance moments after the blast) and terrorists with no really clear motive for terror attacks.  </p>

<p>THAT&#39;S the part that is causing the most talk: Why?  Why would they do this?  It&#39;s not a shock statement of &quot;How could anyone do this kind of thing?&quot; but more of &quot;What did they stand to gain by this?  Terror attack at the race then, what?  Random bombs all over the city?  That makes no kind of statement other than &quot;I haz bombz!  W00T!&quot;</p>

<p>The whole event doesn&#39;t make a whole lot of sense, after all the main attack was a footrace.  Possibly one of the most boring spectacles on Earth.  Granted it was being watched by an international audience but... no one who didn&#39;t have a friend/family member in the race is really motivated to watch it.  5 hours of watching people run down a street?  </p>

<p>So who were the terrorists trying to send a message to?  The Runners?  Their families?  Was the message: We can strike at the most boring sports you have so NO SPORT IS SAFE!</p>

<p>Occam&#39;s Razor says: &quot;The simplest explanation is often the correct one&quot; so what is the simplest explanation?  A terrorist organization decides to bomb an event that is not secure, not heavily watched and not directly linked to a statement?  Two guys decide for no reason to bomb the shit out of Boston starting at the race and then moving on to the University with dozens of stops along the way?  Or an oppressive Government trying to squeeze the last of the control they can out of a bewildered and scared populace?</p>

<p>It just looks too phoney to have bills in place to regulate immigration, gunpowder and surveillance in place on the Hill immediately before bombs made from gunpowder are detonated in a large open space by immigrants.  It&#39;s just too perfect an opportunity.  The Universe itself must have conspired to bring about the absolute perfect storm for these bills.  Or the people that REALLY want them to pass had a hand in it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole thing doesn&#39;t make any sense to me. Dzhokhar was a helpful, loved kid. People knowing him who were being asked how he was, always said that he was really carrying person and he used to smile, always. If you look on his Twitter account, he even says he loves to protect people. Of course you could say, he&#39;s protecting specific people (for example from his nation) and he&#39;s blaming american people for, … for what even? Not giving his older brother the chances he deserves? Maybe he was, uhm … protecting his brother? If he did something cruel and he actually hurt so many people with the knowledge of what he was doing, I think he was influenced by his older brother (even though that wouldn&#39;t change anything about what he did). You know, I always keep thinking about my little sister. Whatever I do, she likes to do it the same way. Not because she specifically likes it, but because I do it and I like it. When I say something, she keeps quoting it to her friends. She believes me and trusts me. And when I&#39;m being hurt by someone (eg. some time ago by my dad) who she really loved, she really protected me and helped me. Not because she didn&#39;t like him, but because he hurt me, and who hurts her older brother is also hurting her. But I think I&#39;m digressing. As someone earlier said: the whole story doesn&#39;t make any sense. And yes, maybe the media, or the government will find a story that makes more sense, but you know what? My feeling is telling me that something is indeed wrong. And I look at his photos and all I see is a person with a face of a good-hearted man. The fact that there&#39;s no safe proof, or a promising evidence makes me disbelieve the official story.</p>

<p>I still have to say: the public still believes the official story and they still believe in what the government says. Lots of people are just not that interested into the &quot;real thing&quot; — otherwise they would get onto platforms on which people are really interested into the truth — for example: Reddit, or Twitter. They still get their information through official sources (like CNN, BBC, FOX News, ABC News, etc.) — and of course through Facebook. YouTube might be a good factor, too. But to make clear what I want to say: now it&#39;s still just some kind of &quot;real-life&quot;-entertainment. Something people can talk about. There will be a movie about it and in some years — well it won&#39;t be forgotten — but the topic will fade away. They simply won&#39;t think much about it anymore, except there&#39;s a new case that remembers them of this case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We all have tunnel vision you included, in which you&#39;ll believe whatever you want to believe.  The evidence is not forthcoming, it&#39;s being metered out to us in tiny eye dropper doses. I think it&#39;s silly for the public to jump to conclusions, and at the same time, I don&#39;t trust the government. Past experience has taught me that everyone lies, and that the worst form of lying is telling mostly the truth, except for a few critical details. Experience also shows me that our elected officials are more than willing to lie to push their politics, it&#39;s just the way the game is played. It&#39;s not just in America, it&#39;s like that everywhere.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the main reason people get caught in lies is because the details don&#39;t add up. Ask anyone that&#39;s had a significant other cheat on them, they figure out their partner is lying because the details don&#39;t add up. The same can be said of the evidence presented by the MSM. I don&#39;t know if they botch it up and misinform because they&#39;re just trying to jump the gun and bring the news before everyone else, or if they&#39;re reading from a script that has to change on the fly? Either is entirely plausible.</p>

<p>Finally, when faced with multiple explanations, reason dictates that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one. The thing is, the explanations that are officially given, often times <strong>appears</strong> overly contrived. This unconsciously can cause doubt in anyone with any semblance of critical thinking.</p>

<p>You seem to be among the more rational from what I&#39;m reading</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but based on previous experience I don&#39;t put it past the government to lie to us about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neither do I. Nor do I feel the need to fabricate a &#39;concrete&#39; reason to in this case.</p>

<p>Believe me, I&#39;m skeptical as fuck. Corporations and government are everywhere, even here on reddit, trying to shape the way people think about a great many number of things. Have you heard of &quot;disinformation&quot; or &quot;poisoning the well&quot;? I suggest you learn just how deep the rabbit hole goes before you buy into this conspiracy theories. You may be the ones most captivated. :)</p>

<p>To me what it really comes down to is this: science is great because not only does it reveal the truth, it reveals <em>actionable data</em>. I&#39;m skeptical of the government; I&#39;m not syaing shit to any suit that shows up, I know my rights, etc. What <em>actionable data</em> am I getting from these wild conspiracy theories? None. It&#39;s just a whole lot more noise. It&#39;s offering me nothing I didn&#39;t already have in the fight against the injustice in the world, and frankly, it&#39;s a bit sad to see so many brain cycles wasted.</p>

<p>In your head, if he doesn&#39;t give proof he&#39;s a government shill trying to derail the conversation, in his head, you&#39;re a lunatic who wants personal pictures to disprove your belief that he&#39;s being paid by the government to lie to you. </p>

<p>I am asking for at least a news interview with his family members and friends.  Jeff Bauman is now an iconic image of the Boston bombing, and is integral to story that was told through the news.  </p>

<p>A story that has constantly changed, a story with little evidence besides a couple of photos and statements released by the F.B.I., a story that has photos of a naked man being taken in to custody that closely resembes Tamerlan Tsarnaev, a story about a nineteen year old who supposedly got away from a firefight then hid in someone&#39;s boat unarmed, a story about the Tsarnaev brothers being contacted by the FBI for at least two years, etc...</p>

<p>If someone claims to know Jeff Bauman or that Jeff Bauman exists then all I ask them is to cite their sources.</p>

<p>Look through these images and then tell me you still dont know there the blood went.</p>

<p>Hes not bleeding out steadily in the wheelchair because he has already lost a huge amount of blood pressure and cause he has a tourniquet applied to both legs. </p>

<p>Also if your not willing to take this guys word that he knows the guy personally then im not willing to take yours that actual EMT&#39;s are question the sotry on this guy because of his lack of blood. Please provide proof of this to back up your claims.</p>

<p>edit: honestly man there are other things that seem skeptical here and you wanna pick the sotry about a guy who got his legs blown off? A decent 5 minute search will lend a decent amount of proof this guy is actually now missing both his legs that he wasnt before the bombing. People like you make me pretty sure the shills dont just take the side of the government, they hide among us actual skeptics and plant false seeds and try and make us look bad to the public. If you dont want to be known as that kind of shill i suggest focusing on things that actually are worth your time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so your delusional. Im looking at 2nd to bottom pic in the album i supplied. There is obviously a wound on his shirt were you can see blood. There is also blood on the foot holder of the wheel chair. The guy in the cowboy hat hands are all bloody. There is blood on his forehead aswell as his hands. Im sure the other side of his shirt is covered in blood. I dont know why you would expect the front of his shirt to have lots of blood if he was laying on his back...</p>

<p>Im sorry but that is not proof of an EMT. Its a post on a bodybuilding forum where a guy says he is an EMT yet provides no actual proof of such. </p>

<p>Also I never called you a shill, little defensive much huh? If you dont want to be called one dont act like one. I give you plenty of proof and pictures and you completely dismiss my claims and offer more bs proof. </p>

<p>Seriously, shouldn&#39;t he have blood and tissue all over himself? He was thrown on his back with his legs over his head immediately following the explosion.  Shouldn&#39;t something have fallen on his shirt? How about his face and hair? Shouldn&#39;t the right side be soaked in blood from when he was lying on the ground?</p>

<p>Just tell us how it could happen, instead of examining what it would mean.</p>

<p>The man who lost his legs was obviously right next to the explosion when it happened. There&#39;s not really any way to dispute that. There is at least 1 photo I&#39;ve seen that shows Bauman standing at the explosion scene minutes before the explosion. STANDING. So Not only did he apply fake injuries, he also got rid of the prosthetic legs that helped him stand in a matter of SECONDS following the explosion. 
If the explosion was fake, he wouldn&#39;t suffer injuries. And if it&#39;s fake, no one else would suffer injuries either. So if he&#39;s an actor and it is a fake explosion, the same goes for everyone else near the explosion. 
Furthermore, if the other injuries are real, there is no need to have this guy as an actor. What purpose would it serve to have someone with fake injuries when there are plenty of other people around with actual injuries? None. And I guess you have to add <a href="https://twitter.com/Edelman11/status/325083563810762753">Boston Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman and Bradley Cooper as being &quot;in&quot; on the conspiracy as well.</a>. And this isn&#39;t even getting into pictures easily found online of Bauman coming from over the past few years doing things you&#39;d need legs to do. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to claim to know anything about the human body, which you seem to be an expert on. A good amount of his blood was probably lost immediately and not anywhere near his body on account of the poor guy&#39;s LEGS BEING BLOWN UP. But &quot;examining what it would mean&quot; is precisely what needs to happen. If you&#39;re going to makes claims about something as serious as this event, you need to think a little deeper about what the results of your claims would be. When you do think a little more critically about it, then all of these actor theories fall apart pretty quickly. Give it a rest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, you&#39;re saying that the blood was &quot;blown away&quot; from the bombs, the arteries magically sealed themselves and the guy wasn&#39;t bleeding?  </p>

<p>Again, it doesn&#39;t matter if he&#39;s an actor or not, or who is in on it.  The fact is that he&#39;s got no blood on his hands or shirt.  This is impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the arteries didn&#39;t magically seal themselves. Thank the guy in the cowboy hat for holding his artery shut. And I guess he also applied the make up to make Bauman look ghost-white while being taken away from the scene in a wheelchair. How does it not matter if he&#39;s an actor? That&#39;s your entire argument. You&#39;re the one claiming he didn&#39;t actually suffer these injuries. You&#39;re the one claiming he&#39;s an actor. You&#39;re the one claiming he&#39;s in on it. Enjoy having the last word, I&#39;m done here.

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone I talk too believes the story 100%. The people on /r conspiracy are not the average public. In fact I would say if this is a false flag it has been a great success, did you not see the flag waving parade. I&#39;ve over heard so many people talking about this at my work. Most of them say things like &quot;we should torture the SOB, and blow his legs off, and see how he likes it:. However for those of us who do question the mass propaganda media, Boston has opened our eyes even wider. Most people don&#39;t even consider for a second that having an act of terrorism while having a drill for the same exact thing is a huge astronomical coincidence.  Yet it has happened at boston, 7/7 and 9/11. (im sure others as well). A guy asked me what i thought about  them catching the guy. I told him &quot;i think it may have been a false flag allowed to happen by our government.&quot; He couldn&#39;t believe it. his response was &quot;why why why would they do that it makes no sense&quot;. when to most of us on here the &quot;why&quot; is the easiest question too answer. I hope OP is right but i disagree. The mass majority of American&#39;s just go home and watch CSI and NCSI, they do not know how this corporate run government that has hijacked our country views them as nothing more than talking cattle.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I would guess that that 80% go the general public is unaware there are even conspiracy theories on the Boston bombings.  Another 18% have heard about them and think you guys are nuts.  1% have heard them and find them interesting, but still believe the official story.  Then, you have he 1% who truely believe something fishy is occurring.  Don&#39;t make the mistake that just because you spend your time on a forum made mostly of this 1% that this is the majority opinion of people.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m a casual reader of conspiracy theories myself, mostly for entertainment.  If there is one thing the Boston, sandy hook and aurora events have taught me is that for every crisis or tragedy which receives a decent amount of media coverage, there will inevitably be conspiracy theories about it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can I make one edit...without a shred of evidence YOU HAVE SEEN to back it up.  The FBI, for all we know, could have tons of evidence condemning these two.  Why do you think they would just release it all on the Internet as soon as its found?

There are literally hundreds of reasons not to release a mass of evidence before a trial.

<p>It&#39;s easy for people to say that when they are just another anonymous keyboard warrior behind a computer screen. Anything that doesn&#39;t fit their narrative is obviously part of the conspiracy. Anyone who doesn&#39;t agree with their narrative is a government shill agent provocateur.

    <div class="md"><p>Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I believe Google trends just shows an indexed amount of searches relative to when that word or phrase was searched the most.  For instance, if a word or phrase&#39;s index is at 50, then it is currently being searched half as much as it was at its highest point.  It tells you nothing about the absolute number of searches.  So, a google trend index of 100 for &#39;false flag&#39; means nothing in the sense that it could mean 500 people are searching for the phrase rather than 100.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Care to elaborate. I didn&#39;t see any &quot;great points&quot; made by the OP. What I did see was the OP speaking on behalf of the American public when in reality he represents a very small percentage of likeminded conspiracy theorists. The overwhelming majority of the public vehemently disagrees with the OP. He provided no sources, citations, stats, data, or evidence. He simply stated an erroneous viewpoint on a conspiracy theory website and it was endorsed by the community because of the nature of the forum.</p>

<p>Edit: I stated an opinion which is based in evidence and data. Instead of mindlessly downvoting dissenting viewpoints, why not provide some data or evidence. If you have any that supports OP&#39;s point I would really like to see it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay.  That&#39;s interesting that you&#39;re not American because OP is talking about US political issues and constitutional rights.  I&#39;m glad that you are interested.  </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to be a conspiracy theorist to know that our government is corrupt and run by corporations.  Where are you from out of curiosity?  I&#39;m not criticizing you.  I would really like to hear what you have to say.  </p>

<p>And telling me to enjoy my &#39;police state&#39;...well, that&#39;s quite the insult because that&#39;s something that is a pretty sensitive and alarming reality that we&#39;re facing in America.  </p>

<p>It matters because if we forget or begin to dismiss its significance [if it&#39;s a false flag], we&#39;re in danger of relapsing back into trusting the government. </p>

<p>Just because the spotlight [mostly negative] is on people who are looking at the official story from a different angle doesn&#39;t mean that more people are believing this. It&#39;s just showing that they&#39;re being far more vocal then normal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a crazy stupid conspiracy thought last night about what you&#39;re saying OP.  Consider this-</p>

<p>1) Public trust and faith in the government has been steadily decreasing.  People are becoming more outraged at everything- spending, benefits, taxes, healthcare, bailouts, legislation.</p>

<p>2) The government, instead of coming up with a plan to take over everyone now, devises a way that they can restore the people&#39;s faith in them.  Whether or not this means the Boston bombing was done by the government, or the government knew about it (and knew who the bombers would be, where they would hide out- essentially knew everything they needed to know to catch the two of them before the attack) and let it happen is up for debate.  </p>

<p>3) The government sets up numerous patsies to create a sense of confusion, and immense information regarding who planted the bombs.</p>

<p>4) The government, in less than a week, figures out who they are, where they are from, where they are hiding, and takes care of them.  I&#39;ve heard nothing but praise for the work of the FBI, ATF, and local PD on MSM.</p>

<p>TL:DR- the government orchestrated everything like a game of chess to restore the faith of the American people. </p>

<p><strong>I know, crazy paranoid theory</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not clear if the government knew who they were or where they were hiding.  The only thing the public had seen to the point they were in pursuit was some grainy pixelated photos and videos of the suspects they were looking for.  It wasn&#39;t until the two suspects robbed a 7/11, killed a police officer, hijacked an SUV and had a shootout with police when I saw the first mentions of the names on TV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I realize that. What I&#39;m saying is similar to the 9/11 theory that the government (FBI, DHS) knew who they were and what they were planning prior to the attacks. Obviously they wouldn&#39;t say they knew, as that would be part of the cover-up. But like I said, crazy theory off the top of my head. One could argue that the lack of stopping it creates more disdain for the government because it shows their incompetence at thwarting attacks before they happen. </p>

<p>You&#39;re asserting that maybe a thousand people were involved, when actually we have no idea how many people that might take. Even if it was a thousand people, do you think they all knew what they were doing? It&#39;s called compartmentalisation. If there were 1000 guys working on the Manhattan Project, it&#39;s likely that maybe 50 of them knew they were designing and building an atomic bomb.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard an off-the-cuff estimate that less than 30 people could have known the full plan behind 9/11.</p>

<p>The idea that &quot;someone would have talked&quot; just doesn&#39;t fly.</p>

<p>Thank you for that astute observation, i&#39;d never considered that; and i may <em>never</em> have considered it, if it wasn&#39;t for your liberal use of caps lock. Again, thank you.</p>

<p>And what does it matter what you think is ridiculous? Unless of course you have some sort of intelligence/high government experience, or contact with people who do, that leads you to think otherwise. I know it will make zero difference to yourself, but that was from a guy called Michael Ruppert; look up his background, then read his book &#39;Crossing the Rubicon&#39;. I&#39;m inclined to believe he&#39;s more qualified than either of us to make those sorts of estimates.</p>

<p>Post 9/11 realisations? No idea, i don&#39;t have all the answers, obviously. However, if you read another comment of mine on this page, you&#39;ll see i&#39;ve listed a few reasons why i think the <em>&quot;But someone would have talked!&quot;</em> line doesn&#39;t hold much weight. </p>

<p>Fun Fact:  We went after German doctors for this same shit during WWII.</p>

<p>They injected 1,500 people, including soldiers and mental patients, with syphilis and gonorrhea and then encouraged them to spread the disease.  Some had injections directly into their eyes.  (Conspiracy theory says they were trying to weaponize STDs -- how charming).  This went on for years.  </p>

<p>It was not made publicly known until a few years ago when the US government apologized.  For more than 60 years, it was kept secret even though 83 people died.</p>

<p>How did that get suppressed?  Surely thousands and thousands of people learned about this over the years and no one came forward with the information. Many doctors were involved. Money was budgeted, supplies were bought, people performed the experiments, someone approved of the use of soldiers and mental patients, and so forth.</p>

<p>And how many other people came across this information years after it had occurred and chose to remain silent?</p>

<p>A report on the study revealed that the government knew it was unethical and the US Surgeon General was involved.</p>

<p>This experiment continued on through into the 1950s.  So how did a conspiracy involving medical professionals, 1,500 patients, 83 deaths spanning more than five years remain secret for so long?</p>

<p>And do you think this is the only atrocity in the past 60 years?</p>

<p>I await your answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What bugs me is the way these two acted once their photos were released. I don&#39;t see how someone who had been planning a bombing for however long these two had been would react like this. </p>

<p>I saw a report that they only had one rifle and various hand guns. (need source) Yet they had somewhere between 6 and 10 bombs. Who has the knowledge and resources to create those explosives, but obtain very few weapons?</p>

<p>The reports made it seem as through these two hadn&#39;t even entertained the idea that they would be caught. Why on earth would they do the things they did? Walk by a 7/11 surveillance camera? Kill a police officer who wasn&#39;t threatening them, but steal a man&#39;s car, drive with him for a bit, then let him go? (A man that we have heard very little from. You&#39;d think our media would be all over him.) Stop to take money from an ATM? (wouldn&#39;t you already have money) And were they just carrying huge bags of explosives and guns with them when they took the man&#39;s car? (i suppose this is definitely possible, but there haven&#39;t been any pictures of guns or explosives recovered... not sure if there would be in this situation)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what all this means, but it certainly doesn&#39;t point toward a well planned attack. So either these two were just nuts, which is a real possibility, or we aren&#39;t getting the full story. If he dies in the hospital in any way I will be extremely skeptical as that picture of him sitting up on the side of the boat doesn&#39;t look like a man in very serious condition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this entirely. The entire story of their capture makes zero sense. Why spend months and maybe years planning an attack where they probably never would have found you, just to turn around and make five dumb mistakes. I feel like even if they were insane, they would have some kind of pattern. Why kill the MIT cop and then let the man whose car they took get away without a scratch?</p>

<p>Regardless if you believe it is a false flag or if it was a legitimate attack, these actions don&#39;t make sense. My other skepticism accompanied with the whole &quot;attack&quot; is that how exactly do they know these two men did this. My family has been all over the news and from the bits and pieces I saw of it, they never show the suspects putting the bags on the ground. Even the FBI said they just assumed that the younger suspect was involved and that they had no evidence of him planting anything. </p>

<p>Nothing adds up with their story. I don&#39;t understand how more people don&#39;t question it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There simply aren&#39;t enough details to make these kind of claims. Perhaps the policeman recognised them, who knows... You also seem to be making the mistake that all people will always act in the most rational way available to them - when history is littered with people doing things which don&#39;t make any sense and going down for it. Its not as easy as just saying their actions don&#39;t make sense and were counterproductive, therefore they were either crazy or it was some form of false flag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I can get behind the fact that our government is corrupt, granted. I can even get behind the planned agendas of taking away freedoms and such. What I find very hard to get behind, if not almost impossible, is the fact that the government would murder men, women, and children - all under the plan of becoming a socialist/communist country. Granted, there are a lot of suspicious things going on, questions not yet answered, etc...</p>

<p>I have no doubt that our society is becoming an immoral one (abortion, gay marriage, etc...) and that liberals have an agenda of a socialist society. I do have major doubts that our military (of which my son is in the National Guard) police, local government, and &quot;actors&quot; are all &quot;in on it&quot; in regards to murdering people to take away gun rights and such.</p>

<p>I have read a lot on here, and some I can maybe understand, but others are just so wacky, I have to wonder if there isn&#39;t some mental stuff going on, such as paranoid schizophrenia. I&#39;m not labeling everyone as crazy on this subreddit, but some behavior is suspect.

<p>But I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s not enough, right? First a person requires evidence, then it&#39;s more and more, and &quot;evidence&quot; moves from being a legitimate influence to a bland word used to excuse ignoring reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, dad, for going way off topic. 
We&#39;re talking about public opinion of the government. And if you can&#39;t tell by how the atmosphere in America has changed that fewer people trust the government, take note of how in this Boston investigation, literally thousands of people were investigating possibilities, and therefore developing their own opinions. And as people are thinking for themselves more and more, they&#39;re increasingly withdrawing their trust in a lousy official story from the government.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is something more/less true depending on people&#39;s sentiment about it??The funny thing about truth is - it remains regardless of what people think of it. People can search for it, close their eyes to it, affirm it, or deny it. The idea that mass belief makes something more/less true is to undermine the definition of truth itself. It&#39;s entirely irrelevent what more people believe. </p>

<p>The only relevence this holds is to control <strong>belief</strong>. &quot;Operacion Verdad&quot; in Cuba was an operation led by the gov&#39;t that employed people to masquerade as everyday citizens and go onto websites/blogs/etc. to refute questions and discredit anyone who disagreed with the gov&#39;t. Part of their belief control involved creating the illusion that most Cubans were in agreement with the gov&#39;t&#39;s policies.</p>

<p>I guess all I&#39;m trying to say is - fuck perceived public opinion. search for truth. and most importantly, know that they don&#39;t necessarily go hand in hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not clearly a False Flag event, but at the same time not enough makes any sort of sense for it to be genuine.  You have clear evidence of organizations on the ground (Multiple people in uniforms who are not officially there; Bomb Squads running simulations/training exercises; large military presence evidenced by their appearance moments after the blast) and terrorists with no really clear motive for terror attacks.  </p>

<p>THAT&#39;S the part that is causing the most talk: Why?  Why would they do this?  It&#39;s not a shock statement of &quot;How could anyone do this kind of thing?&quot; but more of &quot;What did they stand to gain by this?  Terror attack at the race then, what?  Random bombs all over the city?  That makes no kind of statement other than &quot;I haz bombz!  W00T!&quot;</p>

<p>The whole event doesn&#39;t make a whole lot of sense, after all the main attack was a footrace.  Possibly one of the most boring spectacles on Earth.  Granted it was being watched by an international audience but... no one who didn&#39;t have a friend/family member in the race is really motivated to watch it.  5 hours of watching people run down a street?  </p>

<p>So who were the terrorists trying to send a message to?  The Runners?  Their families?  Was the message: We can strike at the most boring sports you have so NO SPORT IS SAFE!</p>

<p>Occam&#39;s Razor says: &quot;The simplest explanation is often the correct one&quot; so what is the simplest explanation?  A terrorist organization decides to bomb an event that is not secure, not heavily watched and not directly linked to a statement?  Two guys decide for no reason to bomb the shit out of Boston starting at the race and then moving on to the University with dozens of stops along the way?  Or an oppressive Government trying to squeeze the last of the control they can out of a bewildered and scared populace?</p>

<p>It just looks too phoney to have bills in place to regulate immigration, gunpowder and surveillance in place on the Hill immediately before bombs made from gunpowder are detonated in a large open space by immigrants.  It&#39;s just too perfect an opportunity.  The Universe itself must have conspired to bring about the absolute perfect storm for these bills.  Or the people that REALLY want them to pass had a hand in it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why does this mean that everyone there is fake, or even if the amputee guy is an actor?  If one person was an actor, must everyone be an actor?  And do you honestly believe these people are accessible by anyone working at the hospital?</p>

<p>I am asking a legitimate question. It doesn&#39;t matter what this means or doesn&#39;t mean.  Why not just address my question?</p>

<p><strong>How can a guy get both his legs blown off, lose half his blood supply, be rolling around on the ground, be gripping his severed limb and not have his hands covered in blood or any blood on his shirt?</strong></p>

<p>Seriously, shouldn&#39;t he have blood and tissue all over himself? He was thrown on his back with his legs over his head immediately following the explosion.  Shouldn&#39;t something have fallen on his shirt? How about his face and hair? Shouldn&#39;t the right side be soaked in blood from when he was lying on the ground?</p>

<p>Just tell us how it could happen, instead of examining what it would mean.</p>

<p>I have a military medic and an EMT telling me that he should be covered in blood, but isn&#39;t. Further, they say that the amount of blood under him in the first pic is far too little.</p>
