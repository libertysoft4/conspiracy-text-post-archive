There are at least a dozen instances of the line &#39;I&#39;m not usually a conspiracy theory whacknut but&#39; or &quot; what is your take on this particlar piece of evidence <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&#39; But for me the sudden influx of posters who try to tie the government government government to our ideas are the ones who are doing the most damage. I do not think those of us who aren&#39;t new here blame the government with such a wide brush, that is 1) a misconception people have about, for lack of a better word &#39;truthers&#39;. Second, and most important,  it is laying down support for the correlation between anti-government rhetoric and this sub. </p>

<p>The government is an apparition, it is made of men and women who have personal agendas beyond their service of government. You can&#39;t point to government, only persons acting in a government role. The flag is not to blame. The white house is not to blame. The FBI is not to blame. Corrupt INDIVIDUALS, and perhaps groups of corrupt INDIVIDUALS almost assuredly are.</p>

<p>edit; this did a lot better than i would&#39;ve thought, sorry i didn&#39;t stick around to reply. Lot&#39;s of good posts and valid points. Thanks for posting.</p>

<p>Show me at least one that makes more sense, I&#39;ll subscribe.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Violence is not a way out of any status quo - it&#39;s a way to replace the top of a status quo. The rest of the pyramid stays the same.</p>

<p>There are two ways out: technology* and secession. You know what makes them work? They both drain the status quo of energy. Any other &quot;solution&quot; makes it stronger.</p>

<p>99%ers were the opposite - vitamins to the systems, a step nowhere. They provided hours and hours of pseudo-discussion in mass media and offered tons upon tons of false hope to media customers.</p>

<p>When enough people realize that false hopes and ignorance are bread and water of the status quo, starving it will be a matter of days.</p>

<hr/>

<ul>
<li>- technology that someone develops without the revolution in mind, purely for pragmatic purposes. Think Gutenberg. You can&#39;t predict it, you can&#39;t control it, it&#39;s beyond the scope of the current status quo. It doesn&#39;t fight or oppose anything - it simply reveals itself.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>We all know what we really need to do and how to handle the situation at hand, but we&#39;re being held back by fear. We don&#39;t need this kind of control (CISPA)(THE MEDIA RIGHT NOW)(blackflagconspiracies) that limits what we see as reality. When we come together and move towards LOVE we can accomplish anything. Fear is just used as control and to keep us back from achieving that. We&#39;re learning more and more everyday about our world and how we need to raise our awareness thanks to the internet, but we&#39;re getting it taken away and we need to spread the word! Don&#39;t be afraid and spread fear! Spread love and how love can effect the situation. We&#39;re all growing and we grow so much more together</p>

There is enough healthcare to heal the world but not enough money.
There are more empty houses than homeless but not enough money to pay for them.
There is enough clean water for the entire world but not enough money to provide it.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t we just get rid of the money and help our fellow people?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems to me that the conflict is generated by blind faith in the powers that be. I think many of those who blame the system do so because the antagonist position is an authoritarian mindset which elevates the command structure above the will of the individual. They obey government simply because it&#39;s government, regardless of the actions or the people who fill the roles. </p>

<p>Blaming government government government is an overreaction to a perceived threat. I relate it to the paddles we used to have in schools... some teachers abused their authority, and society responded by saying NOBODY could use that disciplinary force. The press for gun bans and the continued drug war (as well as some religions&#39; objections to science) is in the same vein - some people are bad, therefore nobody should be free to choose their own path.</p>

<p>For those fighting extremism (be that in government, religion, or simply a favorite pastime, like the way them NASCAR boys brawl over Chevy vs. Ford) it&#39;s important to remind ourselves not to take a position which closes our minds to the positive aspects of those situations which we want to improve. Blind resistance is as bad as blind obedience, and it only turns <strong>us</strong> into the monsters we are trying to stop. Kids shouldn&#39;t be beaten bloody, but neither should they be relieved of the consequences of their actions. The same is true of government.</p>

<p>There is a middle ground between authoritarianism and anarchism where liberty and peace can flourish. Responsibility rests with individuals, ideas are not sacrosanct, and blanket prohibitions just never work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; based on epigenetic forces (genes plus environment, and the interaction between the two). </p>

<p>Imagine an isolated village in which there is a single gun. Whoever has that gun is able to impose their goodness or badness to whatever degree they want. Traditionally, the gun was seized by the most powerful, brutal person in the village--- the one who had been born with genes that would make him grow big and strong, and raised in an environment that promoted win/lose competition over win/win cooperation--- And he used it for his own gain. For a long time, the village families raised their kids so that they would succeed in that competitive, violent environment. </p>

<p>Overtime the villagers improved farming technology and began to build a surplus of food. Certain families in the village saw that living was no longer a zero-sum game. Instead of fostering competition like their predecessors, they raised their kids to be cooperative. </p>

<p>After a couple generations, the majority of villagers had been raised in this way. The majority of them now rejected the use of force to get what they want. And so they formulated a plan: instead of having an all out battle for the gun each year, the village would vote for the best person among them to take it up. The violent minority of villagers put up some resistance, but were unable to turn back the tide, so they accepted it. </p>

<p>The plan looked good to most of the villagers. In this way, they could could cooperatively rule through their chosen representative. And it worked well for a time. But the villagers forgot to take into account one simple fact: peaceful people don&#39;t want exclusive rights to violence.</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t take long for the violent minority to realize this. The saw with each election that some peaceful man or woman would shuffle up and reluctantly embrace the gun when the village had chosen them. And so they made a plan of their own.</p>

<p>The next year, when each peaceful villager went to vote, lo and behold, some of those people who had been violent were giving speeches, passionately declaring their change of heart and their newfound penchant for peace. &quot;Well here&#39;s someone who really wants this job, they&#39;re passionate and they&#39;re knowledgeable. Sure, their family has a violent past, but they&#39;ve changed. Plus we&#39;ve specifically designed this system to promote cooperation, and none of us really want the job anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>With that, the bad people had obtained the gun once again.</p>

<p>Edit: conclusion added</p>

<p>So you see, the problem in the village was not that there were good or bad people, the problem was that there existed a way in which a single person could gain a monopoly on force. It didn&#39;t matter if most people were good, the fact is that bad people want that power more than good people, and will go to greater ends to obtain it. </p>

<p>If the village is to succeed, the only solution is to get rid of the gun once the majority is peaceful. Then, the minority of bad people will have no means to take control over the majority of peaceful villagers. </p>

<p>The gun is government--- a monopoly on the use of force. The initiation of force will only ever be attractive to the evil among us. People worry about an anarchic society &quot;because no one will be able to control the bad guys.&quot; Well, where do you think bad people who want to exploit others go in our system? If they&#39;re poor they become criminals. If they&#39;re not, they become politicians; but I repeat myself. </p>

<p>In the end, the only positive way forward is anarchy. But I don&#39;t know if we&#39;re there yet. I don&#39;t know if the majority of people are peaceful and cooperative. It almost certainly won&#39;t occur in our lifetime, but the historical trends are clear. Overtime, rulers have lost power and the world has become less violent. I don&#39;t see any reason why that should stop now. Or are we arrogant enough to believe that representative democracy is the final stage of societal development and all it needs now are some tweaks here and there? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for that reply! I enjoyed it. </p>

<p>Some clarity questions: </p>

<p>If we are throwing out hypothetical villages, can we look at natural man, as in, a remote village with no gun? </p>

<p>But to further inquire about your first statement that good or evil is epigenetic...</p>

<p>Surely there are men of war, and men of peace birthed by the same mother, </p>

<p>I agree with your statement that an evil person wants power more than a good person. </p>

<p>Back to my op question: </p>

<p>Could it then be said that power is the root of evil instead of the person?</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>Is the person&#39;s desire for power a result of the evil inside of them? </p>

<p>Can power be defined as dominion over another, and/or dominion over self. In such a case if the self is naturally evil, power over an evil self, resulting in good actions, would also be a good power. Thus making power not the cause of the evil, just misplaced energy by weakened people who don&#39;t have the power to triumph over their evil humanity? </p>

<p>using that example: A republic seems like a good attempt to eliminate the weakened, but only if the majority of each district is itself not weak. </p>

<p>If the majority of this country (USA) was not weak, and now is weak. What has changed since 1776. What are the values we&#39;ve allowed to lapse, that have led us to elect weak, evil people, or is our elected majority strong and good?</p>

<p>I 100% agree with that.
I am one of the newer members to sub to this, sub. But I have always lurked here. Never upvoted or commented for the sake of not being profiled. But fuck it. I may live in Canada, but our system is run just like our neighbours to the south. I&#39;ve always said Canada lives in USA&#39;s shadow: media, economy, government, corruption, business, war. </p>

<p>Seriously I said, in my first post, that I created a reddit account because something about Bauman brought up some questions. </p>

<p>I SAID that I thought it suspect because posting pictures that illustrate this guy&#39;s loss is a media wet dream. How the -hell- do you extrapolate from that that I&#39;m a shill? I&#39;m -sure- you&#39;ve heard the phrase &quot;long time reader, first time poster&quot; before, right?

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not so sure of that as you. and sometimes think quite the opposite</p>

<p>if you watch and compare these two videos in regards to elections and voting you can see a obvious flaw and this is just one example of why the US was subverted, voting is not actually voting </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo">The Problems with First Past the Post Voting Explained</a></p>

<p>and now look at this short flash animation simulating Instant RunOff Voting (IRV)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chrisgates.net/irv/">http://www.chrisgates.net/irv/</a></p>

<p>after comparing these two styles of voting it is easy to see that what we do is less than fair and most definitely not democratic. in fact it is anti-democratic and easy to control by the two parties, a obvious conspiracy.</p>

<p>FTFY</p>

<p>I think of the US as a global Corporation because that is how it acts and many people report with documented proof that technically it is, a foreign Corporation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>again the government is illigitamate and has been since the articles of incorporation which were set up in order to be able to eventualy do buisness with another corp....THE ONE THAT ULTIMATLEY TOOK OVER THE RIGHTS TO CREATE OUR COUTRIES CURRENCY SUPPLY....thus turning our currency into a PRODUCT that is created out of thin air and &quot;loaned&quot; to us to use with debt attached. The entire events from 1913, including ww1,ww2,the rise of &quot;communism&quot; {ie. a different central bank} and all the other bullshit is just that....BULLSHIT....winners write history....the winners in this case are the gangsters that run CURRENCY SUPPLY....YOU HAVE NO &quot;COUNTRIES&quot; you have FARMS...inhabited by TAX CATTLE...who are run by FARMERS who use different forms of CONFIDENCE SCAMS {ie. I put you in charge to say your in charge when really I&#39;m in charge} in order to BILK humanity based on FAITH in the FARMERS currency supplies....EVERYTHING is about MEANS OF EXCHANGE...the more MONEY ONE HAS THE MORE power ONE HAS....until you understand that the people who make your money are not doing it for free, until you understand money printed as debt...you understand nothing....UNTIL THE ENTIRE PLANET USES DEBT FREE CURRENCY CREATED AT COST FOR THE PEOPLE BY THE PEOPLE....you will suffer for your ignorance....</p>
