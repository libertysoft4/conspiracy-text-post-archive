<p>This is the main source site. Note that the article doesnt give any sources, and just makes a series of assertions, without any evidence to support.  </p>

<p>Right near the start it says </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bill Gates publicly announced that vaccines could help reduce the world population by 15%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Heres what he actually said
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9vZLlJhI7o">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9vZLlJhI7o</a>   </p>

<p>note hes talking about a slowing the rate of GROWTH.... not population reduction at all.</p>

<p>He&#39;s actually referring to people in poorer countries having too many children just because they want to be sure they will survive to adulthood: this is a key driver of exponential population growth. When the key cause of mortality is disease, vaccinations will increase quality of life, and so these people will not need to have so many children.  </p>

<p>On another note: if you&#39;re new to the antivax argument you should know its based on falsified research by doctor andrew wakefield, who has been struck off (cant work as a doctor anymore) because his &#39;research&#39; was made up.<br/>
also when people tell you there are poisons in vaccines, be aware that being poisonous depends completely on quantity over time i.e anything and everything can be poisonous in the wrong quantity in too shorter time (yes even pure water) </p>

<p>Is what you said.  These words paint a picture about you.  The platitudes you threw in don&#39;t cover up the obvious; it&#39;s clear you don&#39;t understand the word &quot;credible.&quot;  Here&#39;s a quick education.</p>

<p>&quot;Flouride in the water is used for mind control!&quot;  This statement could very well be true, but we have to consider the source&#39;s evidence for such a statement, during which the first question should be &quot;is there any?&quot;</p>

<p>If I say something, I should be able to prove its veracity upon being questioned.</p>

<p>You mean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Miller#New_York_Times_career:_2002.E2.80.932005">Judith Miller&#39;s</a> pro-invasion articles citing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Chalabi#Invasion_of_Iraq">Ahmed Chalabi</a> et. al. on the topic of WMD&#39;s as far back as 1998?  Articles which the U.S. government subsequently latched onto and used to justify the invasion.</p>

<p>Even the CIA considered Chalabi a dubious source of information, yet the <em>New York Times</em> was caught hook, line, and sinker.  If we&#39;re going to lay blame here, it should be squarely on the NYT and the various profiteers who used it&#39;s egregious reporting to justify the invasion of a sovereign nation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My argument is that we need information from all and any source.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then if you say the Earth is an imperfect sphere and I say the Earth is a cube, we should treat these pieces of information equally?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the original claim is that we should totally disregard, or, totally believe something due to the source; I believe that line of thinking is flawed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, we arrived at discrediting the article, <em>after</em> reading it, because the author presented no evidence.  <em>You</em> are the only person hung up on the source as the cause for repudiation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I give you ten dollars without a receipt and later you claim I didn&#39;t, there would be no proof. So, in order to convince another party I would hope they would ask questions and use their critical thinking skills to arrive at an answer.</p>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<li><p>Let&#39;s just repeat here: thimerosal is not actually dangerous, in the same way that table salt is not dangerous, despite &quot;containing&quot; both explosive sodium and deadly chlorine gas.</p></li>
<li><p>The general complaint is against common long-term vaccines (MMR in particular), not annual ones like the flu vaccine. Those childhood vaccines no longer contain thimerosal, so the complaints that MMR vaccines in particular cause autism <em>because of thimerosal</em> are totally off-base. </p></li>

<p>The fact is that the goalposts keep moving because nobody can come up with hard evidence for the proposed relationship.</p>

<p>1)  Are they? Someone who has talked about population control should be questions about their motives when personally funding vaccines.  The debate should occur and these types of posts want to encourage the discussion but they don&#39;t, just people calling each other names.  idiot, moron, shill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realise that his webpage acknowledges that the vaccine can mutate, right?</p>

<p>It would be a half decent conspiracy idea otherwise.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Polio">http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Polio</a></p>

<p>&quot;OPV, the polio vaccine used in most of the developing world, is safe, effective, easy to administer, and inexpensive. But OPV consists of live, weakened viruses, which in very rare cases—1 in every 2.7 million first doses of the vaccine—can cause paralysis. <strong>In settings with very low OPV coverage, OPV vaccine viruses can also mutate and begin to circulate in the population</strong>, just like wild polioviruses.</p>

<p>We support the development of new OPV formulations that are not associated with the risk of mutation as well as vaccine alternatives to OPV. One of the most promising alternatives is inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which is routinely used in most developed countries but has not been broadly used elsewhere because of its higher cost and the need to have a trained provider administer it by injection. We support efforts to lower the cost of IPV and put in place the training, supply, delivery, and communications infrastructure to expand its use. We also support efforts to develop antiviral drugs to respond to a future accidental or intentional reintroduction of poliovirus in the post-eradication era.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is an indication of how stupid, and numbed people really are. You could actually post a video of  Gates strangling a kid and  the Bill shills would down vote you for exposing that. There are so many paid Disinformation agents and  simply others who just cant deal with hard facts. that is the sad nature of our world. A while back,  I did a TIL on my first post about Gardasil, and  I had some 50 upvotes and another 50 downvotes, that means there was an active Shill effort to kill the post. The post was an interview with Dr. Diane Harper, one of the Developers of the vaccine,  in which  she discusses how the Vaccine was not developed for  9 year old girls and does not actually prevent Cervical Cancer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>counter intelligence ops have gotten more sophisticated since the Army infiltration of Reddit back in Q1 of &#39;11 ... they now talk about all the other stupid bullshit they&#39;re obsessed with and make really contrived meme posts to garner the comment karma they need to stay active and more importantly to cover up the fact that they are actually operatives working toward a specific agenda.</p>

<p>An example of such account regularly makes meme posts like &quot;Girls don&#39;t fuck guys who complain about the friendzone&quot; and pokemon references just because reddit sheople who weren&#39;t old enough to remember 9/11 eat that banal garbage up. He has plenty of other accounts and they&#39;re all at the ready and waiting for service in his karma-leveling (more like dissent-silencing) campaigns.</p>

<p>My account is 2 days old for a reason ... I&#39;ve been a redditor for far, far too long.</p>

<p>If you spot an account that&#39;s literally only making posts about topics like gun control it&#39;s because they&#39;re controlled by a less sophisticated group. Pro-gun cointel ops are still learning the lessons the Army learned years ago ... same with anti-gun cointel ops.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>counter intelligence ops have gotten more sophisticated since the Army infiltration of Reddit back in Q1 of &#39;11 ... they now talk about all the other stupid bullshit they&#39;re obsessed with and make really contrived meme posts to garner the comment karma they need to stay active and more importantly to cover up the fact that they are actually operatives working toward a specific agenda.</p>

<p>An example of such account regularly makes meme posts like &quot;Girls don&#39;t fuck guys who complain about the friendzone&quot; and pokemon references just because reddit sheople who weren&#39;t old enough to remember 9/11 eat that banal garbage up. He has plenty of other accounts and they&#39;re all at the ready and waiting for service in his karma-leveling (more like dissent-silencing) campaigns.</p>

<p>My account is 2 days old for a reason ... I&#39;ve been a redditor for far, far too long.</p>

<p>If you spot an account that&#39;s literally only making posts about topics like gun control it&#39;s because they&#39;re controlled by a less sophisticated group. Pro-gun cointel ops are still learning the lessons the Army learned years ago ... same with anti-gun cointel ops.</p>
