    <div class="md"><p>This is true of course. I&#39;m not making the case that North Korea is some promised land of wonderful internet access. Personally I&#39;m under the assumption that only the mega-elite and government  (one in the same?) have access to the internet. </p>

<p>My real point is to demonstrate how fast people downvote without critically thinking that: yes it may be true that none of the civilian population of North Korea has access to the internet, but that certainly doesn&#39;t mean that the internet doesn&#39;t serve a purpose there like it does here. In fact, the insane internet speeds accessible only to the government and not the people can lend credence to the North Korean government brainwashing it&#39;s people into the ground. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Orwellian  states can come in many forms. The most dangerous of these is not the traditional ones like North Korea where control is maintained with Sanctions,  the threat of fear , death, concentration or labour camps . The American Orwellian state is accomplished by consumerism.Totalitarianism is packaged and sold to them over the counter and they wont event know it or care, and when you point out their dangerous purchase, they will scold you for revealing the truth to them. So you just turn away, and let them buy their way to detention centres and curfews and when once more history repeats itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>2 gigs for a nation&#39;s infrastructure is chump change.  You can achieve that with a really small amount of equipment. Look up the speeds an OC-768 can achieve, and understand that&#39;s just a single line.</p>

<p>So yeah, 2 gigs is an OC-48 transmission speed.  2002-2004 time frame.  If that&#39;s state of the art for you, awesome.</p>

<p>And for the ip&#39;s:
<a href="http://www.programva.com/en/ip-addresses-world-countries?u0=%20North%20Korea&amp;amp;uA=IP%20address&amp;amp;id_r=121&amp;amp;opEvent=country">http://www.programva.com/en/ip-addresses-world-countries?u0=%20North%20Korea&amp;amp;uA=IP%20address&amp;amp;id_r=121&amp;amp;opEvent=country</a></p>

<p>Only 6 of 1024 are in use.  Only 1024 IP&#39;s for an entire country is insane.  Definitely NOT state of the art.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also to clarify: Do you think 2.5 Gbits/s is a laughable internet speed?</p>

<p>No, but what is the <em>maximum</em> internet speed in America? Since that 2.5 Gbits/s (assuming it&#39;s even true) is likely only used by their government, what kind of speeds does the U.S. government have access to? If the N. Korea government had faster internet than the U.S. government, that may be something interesting. What you posted was just garbage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, did you even read the wiki page on N. Korea? It makes it sound like that 2.5Gbits/s is only for their local intranet or whatever, not for access to the global web. That makes it even more irrelevant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not irrelevant simply because the public perception of North Korea is skewed in a way that many people believe they live in third-world conditions and never take the time to take into account the transfer of information. </p>

<p>In reference to the intra/internet argument, although it is true that those who actually do have access to the net in North Korea won&#39;t see speeds anywhere near the 2.5 Gbits/s listed when accessing the global web, it is still crucial to note that it has such a fast intranet <em>within</em> itself. </p>
