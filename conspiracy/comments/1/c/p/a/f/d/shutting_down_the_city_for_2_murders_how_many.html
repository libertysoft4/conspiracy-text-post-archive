    <div class="md"><p>Right, it&#39;s more about the mode of destruction than anything. Of course, I am still highly skeptical about the whole event, but just because the bombs only killed 2 people doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s not valid reason to capture &quot;whoever&quot; the suspects are ASAP because it would be a matter of time before they injured many more. There still should be a trial and I&#39;m still bewildered that there&#39;s only 2 suspects and that we&#39;ve honed in on them like we have with ruthlessness. People cheering in the streets before they&#39;ve had their day in court. Maybe we ha the wrong guys? Maybe there&#39;s way more to all of this then we know? All the more reason for a trial, for the sake of our rights as citizens. We are presumed innocent until proven guilty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just find it strange that the military in Boston would find it necessary to shut down the city and have hundreds of military and armored vehicles in the streets, going door to door saying that citizens cannot leave their houses, so that they can find the <em>suspect</em> of a crime. It is not like the guy got arrested, found guilty of the bombing, then escaped and was on the run. Then I can see them taking some more measures to find the guy. But to have this martial law declared to locate a suspect? Give me a break. Also, as far as getting into a shootout with police. I don&#39;t see any evidence of who fired first. If the military are firing guns at you, and you have a gun handy, would you sit in the fetal position until they kill you, or will you fire back and try to take some of them out? I guess it depends on each person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in Boston, and this was not martial law. We went out and got beer. Dunkin&#39; Donuts was open. There weren&#39;t many people on the streets, but there were some. </p>

<p>It was a strong suggestion to stay indoors.</p>

<p>Why on earth would they request that people stay indoors?</p>

<ol>
<li>Because there was evidence that the guy was extremely dangerous, possessed high powered weapons and explosives, and there were fears that there may be other IEDs planted. Given the danger (and the really small size of Boston), it was probably a damn good idea to stay off the streets. </li>
<li>Because they had lost the trail of the suspect. It&#39;s a lot harder to find the suspect if the streets are full of people. </li>
</ol>

<p>On another note, you seemed to emphasize that he was a SUSPECT. Why would he go on a huge manhunt with high powered weapons and explosives if he was actually only a suspect? Why not try to automatically clear his name? This guy was still posting on Twitter. He certainly could have tried to make the case that he was innocent, starting there. </p>

<p>What is that? Maybe I do not know what you consider to be &quot;martial law,&quot; but by my understanding, the term &quot;martial law&quot; refers to a situation where the military is deployed to control a situation or to control an area and maintain order. If armed military with M4s and full battle garb alongside armored vehicles is not a deployment of military to control an area, I don&#39;t know what is... You don&#39;t have to be in Boston to be able to look at a picture and tell if that is military.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus Christ, are you really this stupid.</p>

<p>!43 people being shot at once or being blown up would still result in a manhunt of the same scale. Shutting down the city for one person being shot would be stupid of course but for some guys who have explosives and are willing to detonate them in public places it is not.</p>

<p>And you know what they dont need allot of evidence right now as the guys shot back for christs sake. They used explosives. The ploice didnt execture two young guys in a private place they had a fucking shoot out in public.</p>

<p>You are trying to make a conspiracy out of something and it just dosent make sense. If the goverment wanted to enforce gun laws why not get a guy to start shooting an assault rifle at the marathon, the death count would have been higher.</p>

<p>If they wanted to just cause terror amongst the citizen ship then why bother catching anyone, people who drop bombs and dont get caught are much more scary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think so at all. Boston is a very urban area, shutting down public transportation was the obvious action that was taken, and actually shutting down the city was a rational way of approaching things if you ask me. You can label it as overkill if you think its so easy to combat someone who could potentially blow you the fuck up, and your colleagues, and already shot at several other people. </p>

<p>When I think about it quickly, I would like to think its so easy to track down one person. But when I think it through and consider all the factors and the size of the area, I personally realize its not so simple. Technology certainly helps but its not an end-all be-all. </p>

Because most of them are ex-SOF themselves. They fucking sat in a backyard and threw flashbangs at a boat for an hour? Do you even know what a flashbang does to a human being? Or just what you have seen in COD? Oh and throwing bombs huh? Let me tell you a little something about MRAP&#39;s. There were multiple on the scene. Do you know what MRAP stands for? Mine Resistant Anti Personnel vehicle. Don&#39;t even get me started on the helicopters. How many times have you been watching Worlds Wildest Police Chases and the fucking car gets away?

I imagine it would have been more simple if it was a certainty that he was unarmed, wasn&#39;t wearing a suicide vest, or any other kind of vest, and also wasn&#39;t carrying other weapons with him. Could something like that have been known to begin with? I&#39;m not so sure. Of course, if this was all staged, that makes all those points moot, but that&#39;s an intellectual leap I&#39;m not going to take until I understand this more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, Your point is silly. This isn&#39;t just a couple of murders. It&#39;s a planned bombing of a big event, it&#39;s terrorism. This isn&#39;t terribly common in America. Also,  he was heavily armed in a RESIDENTIAL area. He could of killed even more easily, since he knew he would get caught soon. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s more about how the FBI has been watching him and there&#39;s signs that point to prior knowledge that the bombing was going to happen. And also how he got away so easily.</p>

<p>Did police react correctly in regards to the severity of the situation? Yes. But did they let this happen, to practice their martial law drills and push political agendas? Very, very possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just two suspects? This isn&#39;t two dudes who robbed a gas station and shot the cashier. These are guys who planted a bomb in a crowd, which blew up and left arms, legs, pools of blood and a hundred people screaming in agony. How the hell are you supposed to handle people running around a city planting bombs?</p>

<p>A bomb doesnt discriminate on how many people put it there, it fucking blows up. It doesnt matter if it was 2 men, 200 men, or a 10 year old girl who put it there. It does damage. It blew peoples limbs off. It&#39;s fucked up, so they shut the city down, and got the guys. Ask anyone from boston if they think the police went overkill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.  Law enforcement all over the US have been investing heavily in military-grade and crowd-control equipment.  They&#39;ve also been training in tactics for handling these types of situations for at least a decade.  I know and love people in law enforcement...I respect them and I admire them.  I also believe they enjoy the militarization of their duties, which is understandable for many reasons.</p>

<p>What I distrust is the &quot;playbook&quot; that I see unfolding over the last several years....a playbook of tactics that can be used on an alleged couple of lone nutjobs - or on an entire section of a US suburb.</p>

<p>The equipment being used and the &#39;military lock-down&#39; of a US city by it&#39;s own law enforcement is IN NO WAY justified.  And Bostonians, no matter how outraged, should by no means be excused if they are accepting what is happening there.  </p>
